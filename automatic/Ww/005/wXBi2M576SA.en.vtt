you got your buttons over here with
various<00:00:29.429> functions<00:00:29.580> which<00:00:30.000> I'll<00:00:30.150> go<00:00:30.330> through

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
various functions which I'll go through

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.060 
various functions which I'll go through
in<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.750> moment<00:00:31.700> it's<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.820> 6<00:00:33.120> kg<00:00:33.630> drum<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.110> it's<00:00:34.980> a

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
in a moment it's a 6 kg drum and it's a

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.340 
in a moment it's a 6 kg drum and it's a
1200<00:00:35.700> mini<00:00:36.090> machine<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:36.630> it's<00:00:36.750> fairly<00:00:36.989> fast

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
1200 mini machine so it's fairly fast

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.510 
1200 mini machine so it's fairly fast
spin<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:38.160> door<00:00:38.489> opening<00:00:39.000> on<00:00:39.180> this<00:00:39.450> as<00:00:40.250> you<00:00:41.250> can
