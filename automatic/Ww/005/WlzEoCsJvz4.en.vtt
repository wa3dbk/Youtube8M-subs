00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
plane was almost entirely rebuilt only

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.110 
plane was almost entirely rebuilt only
the<00:00:51.290> original<00:00:51.800> base<00:00:51.980> model<00:00:52.339> and<00:00:52.460> liveries<00:00:52.879> are

the original base model and liveries are

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.630 
the original base model and liveries are
still<00:00:53.390> the<00:00:53.540> same<00:00:54.070> speaking<00:00:55.070> of<00:00:55.190> the<00:00:55.309> model

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
still the same speaking of the model

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.930 
still the same speaking of the model
let's<00:00:56.089> take<00:00:56.300> a<00:00:56.329> closer<00:00:56.660> look<00:00:56.840> at<00:00:56.989> that<00:00:57.340> as<00:00:58.340> you

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
let's take a closer look at that as you

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.760 
let's take a closer look at that as you
might<00:00:59.149> be<00:00:59.300> familiar<00:00:59.480> with<00:00:59.870> this<00:01:00.230> plane<00:01:00.530> I

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
might be familiar with this plane I

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.099 
might be familiar with this plane I
won't<00:01:01.129> go<00:01:01.309> into<00:01:01.489> detail<00:01:01.879> about<00:01:02.090> the<00:01:02.510> exterior

00:01:03.099 --> 00:01:03.109 
won't go into detail about the exterior

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:05.859 
won't go into detail about the exterior
of<00:01:03.320> this<00:01:03.500> plane<00:01:03.850> you<00:01:04.850> know<00:01:04.879> it<00:01:05.149> looks<00:01:05.330> good<00:01:05.539> but

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
of this plane you know it looks good but

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:07.779 
of this plane you know it looks good but
some<00:01:06.259> of<00:01:06.410> the<00:01:06.590> liveries<00:01:06.950> could<00:01:07.340> be<00:01:07.490> more

00:01:07.779 --> 00:01:07.789 
some of the liveries could be more

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:09.999 
some of the liveries could be more
detailed<00:01:08.240> so<00:01:08.990> let's<00:01:09.320> take<00:01:09.530> a<00:01:09.560> look<00:01:09.800> at<00:01:09.890> the

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
detailed so let's take a look at the

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.120 
detailed so let's take a look at the
interior<00:01:10.429> model<00:01:11.000> of<00:01:11.149> this<00:01:11.390> 787<00:01:12.320> the<00:01:12.740> cockpit

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
of this plane is just gorgeous it has

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.320 
of this plane is just gorgeous it has
many<00:01:15.679> amazingly<00:01:16.250> detailed<00:01:16.520> instruments

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
many amazingly detailed instruments

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.690 
many amazingly detailed instruments
which<00:01:17.869> are<00:01:18.080> controllable<00:01:18.590> just<00:01:19.280> like<00:01:19.460> in<00:01:19.610> the

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
which are controllable just like in the

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.880

electronic flight back this plane has an
entirely<00:01:26.660> new<00:01:27.080> cockpit<00:01:27.610> each<00:01:28.610> of<00:01:28.850> these

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
entirely new cockpit each of these

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.429

so<00:01:32.810> definitely<00:01:33.320> check<00:01:33.439> that<00:01:33.680> out<00:01:33.950> if<00:01:34.310> you<00:01:34.520> want

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
so definitely check that out if you want

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.550 
so definitely check that out if you want
to<00:01:34.820> control<00:01:35.150> this<00:01:35.390> plane<00:01:35.689> like<00:01:35.960> a<00:01:35.990> real<00:01:36.290> pilot

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
to control this plane like a real pilot

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.219 
to control this plane like a real pilot
this<00:01:37.520> plane<00:01:37.820> is<00:01:38.030> one<00:01:38.180> of<00:01:38.299> the<00:01:38.390> few<00:01:38.659> airliners

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
this plane is one of the few airliners

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:40.990 
this plane is one of the few airliners
in<00:01:39.380> flight<00:01:39.590> care<00:01:39.799> to<00:01:39.920> have<00:01:40.070> such<00:01:40.340> an<00:01:40.520> advanced

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
in flight care to have such an advanced

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.940 
in flight care to have such an advanced
cockpit<00:01:41.210> and<00:01:41.570> keep<00:01:42.049> in<00:01:42.170> mind<00:01:42.200> that<00:01:42.530> this<00:01:42.710> is

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
cockpit and keep in mind that this is

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.149 
cockpit and keep in mind that this is
still<00:01:43.189> in<00:01:43.369> development<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:45.380> flight<00:01:45.590> dynamics

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
still in development the flight dynamics

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.030 
still in development the flight dynamics
of<00:01:46.369> the<00:01:46.549> Boeing<00:01:46.909> 787-8<00:01:47.810> and<00:01:48.079> flight<00:01:48.350> gear<00:01:48.590> are

of the Boeing 787-8 and flight gear are

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.850 
of the Boeing 787-8 and flight gear are
quite<00:01:49.369> close<00:01:49.700> to<00:01:49.939> the<00:01:50.090> real<00:01:50.270> thing<00:01:50.860> the

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
quite close to the real thing the

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.830 
quite close to the real thing the
developers<00:01:52.369> looked<00:01:52.610> at<00:01:52.759> accurate<00:01:53.329> analysis

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
developers looked at accurate analysis

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.310 
developers looked at accurate analysis
data<00:01:54.079> of<00:01:54.350> real<00:01:54.619> 787-8<00:01:55.549> flights<00:01:56.000> and<00:01:56.240> as<00:01:57.020> far<00:01:57.200> as

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
data of real 787-8 flights and as far as

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.740 
data of real 787-8 flights and as far as
I<00:01:57.439> can<00:01:57.500> tell<00:01:57.799> the<00:01:58.189> results<00:01:58.610> are<00:01:58.729> great<00:01:58.909> the

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
I can tell the results are great the

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.749 
I can tell the results are great the
plane<00:01:59.960> handles<00:02:00.380> nicely<00:02:00.829> but<00:02:01.130> sometimes<00:02:01.579> it

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
plane handles nicely but sometimes it

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.130 
plane handles nicely but sometimes it
feels<00:02:01.909> a<00:02:02.060> lot<00:02:02.180> different<00:02:02.240> than<00:02:02.840> other

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
feels a lot different than other

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.289 
feels a lot different than other
airliners<00:02:03.770> in<00:02:03.920> flight<00:02:04.130> gear<00:02:04.340> that's<00:02:04.939> because
