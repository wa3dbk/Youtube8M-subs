they're<00:00:13.700> often<00:00:14.240> misunderstood<00:00:14.990> what<00:00:15.710> a

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:15.769 
they're often misunderstood what a

they're often misunderstood what a
speedometer<00:00:16.279> calibration<00:00:16.460> is<00:00:17.179> and<00:00:17.509> how<00:00:17.779> it

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:17.929 
speedometer calibration is and how it

speedometer calibration is and how it
works

00:00:19.149 --> 00:00:19.159 
works

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:21.069 
works
the<00:00:19.519> basic<00:00:20.060> way<00:00:20.239> I<00:00:20.269> think<00:00:20.480> I've<00:00:20.689> explained

00:00:21.069 --> 00:00:21.079 
the basic way I think I've explained

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:23.769 
the basic way I think I've explained
before<00:00:21.169> that<00:00:21.769> it<00:00:21.890> works<00:00:22.130> is<00:00:22.460> the<00:00:22.759> you<00:00:23.269> go<00:00:23.569> to<00:00:23.630> a

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
before that it works is the you go to a

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:25.630 
before that it works is the you go to a
shop<00:00:24.050> that<00:00:24.409> does<00:00:24.800> these<00:00:25.069> so<00:00:25.369> you<00:00:25.460> don't

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
shop that does these so you don't

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.909 
shop that does these so you don't
normally<00:00:25.759> take<00:00:26.149> it<00:00:26.329> to<00:00:26.449> your<00:00:26.539> regular<00:00:26.929> auto

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:27.919 
normally take it to your regular auto

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:30.279 
normally take it to your regular auto
dealer<00:00:28.550> you<00:00:28.999> take<00:00:29.179> it<00:00:29.300> to<00:00:29.419> a<00:00:29.449> shop<00:00:29.749> that<00:00:30.019> does

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
dealer you take it to a shop that does

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:32.770 
dealer you take it to a shop that does
speedometer<00:00:30.979> calibrations<00:00:31.669> and<00:00:31.970> they<00:00:32.570> put

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
speedometer calibrations and they put

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.119 
speedometer calibrations and they put
the<00:00:32.870> car<00:00:33.109> on<00:00:33.289> what's<00:00:33.530> called<00:00:33.739> a<00:00:33.859> dynamometer

the car on what's called a dynamometer

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:37.240 
the car on what's called a dynamometer
it's<00:00:35.090> a<00:00:35.269> machine<00:00:35.420> that<00:00:36.050> basically<00:00:36.469> runs<00:00:37.039> the

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
it's a machine that basically runs the

it's a machine that basically runs the
car<00:00:37.519> at<00:00:37.879> this<00:00:38.600> designated<00:00:39.320> speeds<00:00:39.710> they<00:00:40.129> put

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
car at this designated speeds they put

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.220 
car at this designated speeds they put
that<00:00:40.519> wheels<00:00:40.730> actually<00:00:41.179> on<00:00:41.329> this<00:00:41.600> machine<00:00:42.019> and

that wheels actually on this machine and
they<00:00:42.379> run<00:00:42.620> the<00:00:42.769> machine<00:00:43.190> and<00:00:43.489> that<00:00:44.089> runs<00:00:44.390> the

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
they run the machine and that runs the

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.750 
wheels of the vehicle at whatever speed
they<00:00:46.879> want<00:00:47.149> and<00:00:47.510> once<00:00:48.410> the<00:00:48.620> car<00:00:48.829> is<00:00:48.859> running<00:00:49.550> at

they want and once the car is running at
the<00:00:49.789> speed<00:00:50.059> designated<00:00:51.050> by<00:00:51.140> the<00:00:51.199> machine<00:00:51.679> the

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:52.249 
the speed designated by the machine the

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:54.489 
the speed designated by the machine the
mechanics<00:00:52.820> then<00:00:53.059> read<00:00:53.390> the<00:00:53.839> speedometer<00:00:54.469> and

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:54.499 
mechanics then read the speedometer and

00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:57.040 
mechanics then read the speedometer and
see<00:00:54.859> what<00:00:55.039> it's<00:00:55.190> showing<00:00:55.280> and<00:00:55.820> they<00:00:56.449> note<00:00:56.749> that

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
see what it's showing and they note that

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.540 
see what it's showing and they note that
any<00:00:57.409> difference<00:00:57.890> so<00:00:58.039> they'll<00:00:58.219> give<00:00:58.399> you<00:00:58.489> a

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
any difference so they'll give you a

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.380 
any difference so they'll give you a
report<00:00:58.909> that<00:00:59.359> shows<00:00:59.719> at<00:01:00.140> 10<00:01:00.859> 20<00:01:01.429> 30<00:01:01.730> 40<00:01:02.239> miles

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
report that shows at 10 20 30 40 miles

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.410 
report that shows at 10 20 30 40 miles
an<00:01:02.600> hour<00:01:02.690> and<00:01:02.960> so<00:01:03.170> on<00:01:03.350> the<00:01:04.159> comparison<00:01:05.149> of<00:01:05.269> the

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
an hour and so on the comparison of the

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.460 
an hour and so on the comparison of the
machines<00:01:05.869> known<00:01:06.500> speed<00:01:07.009> versus<00:01:07.970> the<00:01:08.689> speed

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
machines known speed versus the speed

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.649 
machines known speed versus the speed
reading<00:01:09.950> of<00:01:10.100> your<00:01:10.220> speedometer<00:01:10.820> so<00:01:11.420> that

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
reading of your speedometer so that

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:13.630 
reading of your speedometer so that
report<00:01:11.899> is<00:01:12.380> the<00:01:12.530> crucial<00:01:13.040> part<00:01:13.340> of<00:01:13.520> the

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
report is the crucial part of the

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.190 
report is the crucial part of the
speedometer<00:01:14.119> calibration<00:01:14.240> because<00:01:15.020> that's

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
speedometer calibration because that's

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.690 
speedometer calibration because that's
what<00:01:15.350> we<00:01:15.439> need<00:01:15.470> to<00:01:15.920> take<00:01:16.100> to<00:01:16.280> court<00:01:16.520> to<00:01:16.670> show

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
what we need to take to court to show

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.959 
what we need to take to court to show
the<00:01:17.090> judge<00:01:17.649> to<00:01:18.649> show<00:01:18.920> if<00:01:19.369> there<00:01:19.729> was<00:01:19.820> any

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:19.969 
the judge to show if there was any

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:21.910 
the judge to show if there was any
discrepancy<00:01:20.719> in<00:01:21.020> the<00:01:21.170> calibration<00:01:21.530> of<00:01:21.860> your

discrepancy in the calibration of your
speedometer<00:01:22.780> but<00:01:23.780> the<00:01:24.020> key<00:01:24.200> thing<00:01:24.229> that<00:01:24.710> so

actually going to help the case you
can't<00:01:39.740> just<00:01:39.979> take<00:01:40.130> any<00:01:40.430> calibration<00:01:40.850> report

we're trying to show hopefully that your
speedometer<00:01:53.509> was<00:01:53.840> reading<00:01:54.259> lower<00:01:54.590> than<00:01:55.280> the

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
speedometer was reading lower than the

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.999 
speedometer was reading lower than the
speed<00:01:55.759> you're<00:01:56.030> actually<00:01:56.689> where<00:01:57.380> your<00:01:57.619> vehicle

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
speed you're actually where your vehicle

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.130 
speed you're actually where your vehicle
was<00:01:58.100> actually<00:01:58.460> going<00:01:58.670> so<00:01:59.630> if<00:01:59.750> you<00:01:59.869> look<00:02:00.049> at

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
was actually going so if you look at

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.169 
was actually going so if you look at
your<00:02:00.289> report<00:02:00.679> you'll<00:02:01.070> see<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.399> known<00:02:01.640> speeds

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:02.179 
your report you'll see the known speeds

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:04.510 
your report you'll see the known speeds
of<00:02:02.570> the<00:02:03.079> dynamometer<00:02:03.590> versus<00:02:04.399> the

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
of the dynamometer versus the

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.710 
of the dynamometer versus the
speedometer<00:02:05.119> reading<00:02:05.329> and<00:02:05.719> what

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
speedometer reading and what

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.900 
speedometer reading and what
want<00:02:06.900> to<00:02:06.990> look<00:02:07.140> for<00:02:07.470> is<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.800> reading<00:02:08.520> that<00:02:08.670> shows

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
want to look for is a reading that shows

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.940 
want to look for is a reading that shows
that<00:02:09.119> your<00:02:09.270> speedometer<00:02:09.899> number<00:02:10.290> is<00:02:10.530> lower

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
that your speedometer number is lower

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.540 
that your speedometer number is lower
than<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.850> known<00:02:12.090> speed<00:02:12.600> of<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.900> dynamometer

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
than the known speed of the dynamometer

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.190 
than the known speed of the dynamometer
so<00:02:14.550> what<00:02:14.730> that<00:02:14.910> would<00:02:15.150> tell<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.510> judge<00:02:15.780> is

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
so what that would tell the judge is

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.260 
so what that would tell the judge is
that<00:02:16.590> if<00:02:16.680> your<00:02:16.830> charge<00:02:17.130> let's<00:02:17.490> stay<00:02:17.670> with<00:02:17.700> 85

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
that if your charge let's stay with 85

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.260 
that if your charge let's stay with 85
miles<00:02:18.540> an<00:02:18.690> hour<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:19.290> if<00:02:20.100> your<00:02:20.280> speedometer<00:02:21.000> at

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
miles an hour and if your speedometer at

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.510 
miles an hour and if your speedometer at
85<00:02:21.780> miles<00:02:22.020> an<00:02:22.230> hour<00:02:22.380> would<00:02:23.070> have<00:02:23.250> only<00:02:23.400> been

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
85 miles an hour would have only been

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
85 miles an hour would have only been
reading<00:02:24.000> 82<00:02:24.570> or<00:02:24.990> 80

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
reading 82 or 80

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.330 
reading 82 or 80
that<00:02:27.540> you<00:02:27.660> didn't<00:02:27.900> know<00:02:28.140> you<00:02:28.170> were<00:02:28.650> going<00:02:28.890> 85

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
that you didn't know you were going 85

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.310 
that you didn't know you were going 85
miles<00:02:29.760> an<00:02:29.940> hour<00:02:30.120> your<00:02:30.720> speedometer

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
miles an hour your speedometer

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.250 
miles an hour your speedometer
essentially<00:02:31.920> lied<00:02:32.130> to<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:32.550> and<00:02:32.790> since<00:02:33.780> unless

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
essentially lied to you and since unless

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.870 
essentially lied to you and since unless
you<00:02:34.440> know<00:02:34.650> otherwise<00:02:34.950> you're<00:02:35.400> entitled<00:02:35.640> to

you know otherwise you're entitled to

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
rely on your speedometer that's why

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.140 
rely on your speedometer that's why
they're<00:02:37.590> there<00:02:37.830> so<00:02:38.310> we<00:02:38.460> can<00:02:38.610> know<00:02:38.760> how<00:02:38.880> fast

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
they're there so we can know how fast

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.760 
they're there so we can know how fast
we're<00:02:39.420> going<00:02:39.570> and<00:02:39.930> know<00:02:40.050> if<00:02:40.200> we're<00:02:40.350> speeding

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
we're going and know if we're speeding

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.490 
we're going and know if we're speeding

give you credit for that and reduce the

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.770 
give you credit for that and reduce the
charge<00:02:52.980> by<00:02:53.550> however<00:02:53.970> much<00:02:54.180> your<00:02:54.450> speed<00:02:54.690> on

whatever<00:02:55.050> is<00:02:55.170> reading<00:02:55.440> low<00:02:56.150> but<00:02:57.150> that's<00:02:57.330> the

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
whatever is reading low but that's the

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.210 
whatever is reading low but that's the
key<00:02:57.750> thing<00:02:57.990> your<00:02:58.170> speedometer<00:02:58.709> needs<00:02:58.920> to<00:02:59.100> be

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
key thing your speedometer needs to be

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.670 
key thing your speedometer needs to be
reading<00:02:59.550> low<00:02:59.820> if<00:03:00.300> your<00:03:00.810> speedometers<00:03:01.380> reading

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
reading low if your speedometers reading

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.500 
reading low if your speedometers reading
higher<00:03:02.160> than<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:02.760> actual<00:03:03.120> speed<00:03:03.330> of<00:03:03.390> the

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
higher than the actual speed of the

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.290 
higher than the actual speed of the
vehicle<00:03:03.959> so<00:03:04.530> let's<00:03:04.740> say<00:03:04.980> that<00:03:05.310> at<00:03:05.430> 85<00:03:05.910> miles<00:03:06.150> an

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
vehicle so let's say that at 85 miles an

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.030 
vehicle so let's say that at 85 miles an
hour<00:03:06.450> for<00:03:06.690> the<00:03:06.780> dynamometer<00:03:07.290> your

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
hour for the dynamometer your

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.000 
hour for the dynamometer your
speedometer<00:03:08.700> was<00:03:08.850> reading<00:03:09.209> 88<00:03:09.890> that<00:03:10.890> would

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
speedometer was reading 88 that would

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.470 
speedometer was reading 88 that would
mean<00:03:11.190> that<00:03:11.310> you're<00:03:11.489> reading<00:03:11.700> three<00:03:12.239> miles

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
mean that you're reading three miles

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.330 
mean that you're reading three miles
higher<00:03:12.989> than<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.830> speed<00:03:14.040> that<00:03:14.190> you're

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
higher than the speed that you're

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.759 
higher than the speed that you're
charged<00:03:14.760> with<00:03:14.850> which<00:03:15.840> would<00:03:16.019> mean<00:03:16.200> that<00:03:16.260> if

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
charged with which would mean that if

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.440 
charged with which would mean that if
the<00:03:16.950> trooper<00:03:17.340> is<00:03:17.400> correct<00:03:17.790> and<00:03:18.030> he<00:03:18.150> clocked

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
the trooper is correct and he clocked

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.170 
the trooper is correct and he clocked
you<00:03:18.600> at<00:03:18.660> 85<00:03:19.200> your<00:03:20.160> speedometer<00:03:20.760> probably

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
you at 85 your speedometer probably

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.820 
you at 85 your speedometer probably
would<00:03:21.330> have<00:03:21.390> been<00:03:21.510> reading<00:03:21.840> 88<00:03:22.230> miles<00:03:22.500> an<00:03:22.650> hour

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
would have been reading 88 miles an hour

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.650 
would have been reading 88 miles an hour
so<00:03:23.519> that<00:03:23.730> would<00:03:23.880> mean<00:03:24.060> that<00:03:24.090> you<00:03:24.360> thought<00:03:24.570> you

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
so that would mean that you thought you

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.830 
so that would mean that you thought you
were<00:03:24.780> going<00:03:24.930> even<00:03:25.290> faster<00:03:25.560> than<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.430> claim<00:03:26.840> by

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
were going even faster than the claim by

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.350 
were going even faster than the claim by
the<00:03:27.870> trooper<00:03:28.459> and<00:03:29.459> so<00:03:29.670> that's<00:03:29.880> not<00:03:30.060> gonna<00:03:30.180> help

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
the trooper and so that's not gonna help

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.660 
the trooper and so that's not gonna help
us<00:03:30.480> at<00:03:30.630> all<00:03:30.750> in<00:03:30.900> fact<00:03:31.110> I<00:03:31.530> don't<00:03:31.980> know<00:03:32.310> that<00:03:32.519> many

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
us at all in fact I don't know that many

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.670 
us at all in fact I don't know that many
judges<00:03:33.030> would<00:03:33.180> hold<00:03:33.420> it<00:03:33.540> against<00:03:33.900> you<00:03:34.110> but

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
judges would hold it against you but

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.620 
judges would hold it against you but
some<00:03:35.130> judges<00:03:35.370> might<00:03:35.730> at<00:03:36.000> least<00:03:36.269> in<00:03:36.390> the<00:03:36.480> back

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
some judges might at least in the back

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.270 
some judges might at least in the back
of<00:03:36.780> their<00:03:36.900> mind<00:03:37.080> thankful<00:03:37.650> you<00:03:37.860> even<00:03:38.130> thought

says<00:03:40.010> so<00:03:41.010> that's<00:03:41.250> a<00:03:41.370> calibration<00:03:41.820> report<00:03:42.299> that

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
says so that's a calibration report that

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.060 
says so that's a calibration report that
we<00:03:42.570> don't<00:03:42.750> want<00:03:42.870> to<00:03:42.900> take<00:03:43.049> into<00:03:43.260> court<00:03:43.560> we<00:03:43.860> want

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.800 
your speedometer is dead on if you get
it<00:03:52.830> calibrated<00:03:53.340> and<00:03:53.640> it<00:03:53.730> shows<00:03:54.000> that<00:03:54.239> at<00:03:54.360> 85

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
it calibrated and it shows that at 85

it calibrated and it shows that at 85
your<00:03:55.530> speedometer<00:03:56.070> is<00:03:56.130> reading<00:03:56.370> exactly<00:03:56.670> 85

then I don't see any purpose to bring it
to<00:04:00.600> court<00:04:00.750> but<00:04:01.080> it<00:04:01.170> won't<00:04:01.350> hurt<00:04:01.530> you

some calibrations are great I recommend
them<00:05:10.070> in<00:05:10.160> a<00:05:10.250> lot<00:05:10.400> of<00:05:10.430> cases<00:05:10.729> but<00:05:11.570> you<00:05:11.630> need

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
them in a lot of cases but you need

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.600 
them in a lot of cases but you need
before<00:05:12.470> you<00:05:12.560> take<00:05:12.740> it<00:05:12.770> to<00:05:12.890> court<00:05:13.130> you<00:05:13.370> need<00:05:13.520> to

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
before you take it to court you need to

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.760 
before you take it to court you need to
make<00:05:13.820> sure<00:05:13.850> that<00:05:14.090> it<00:05:14.450> actually<00:05:14.690> helps<00:05:15.470> your

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
make sure that it actually helps your

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.159 
make sure that it actually helps your
case<00:05:16.070> and<00:05:16.460> the<00:05:17.090> best<00:05:17.270> way<00:05:17.419> to<00:05:17.479> do<00:05:17.690> that<00:05:17.840> is<00:05:18.020> to

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
case and the best way to do that is to

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:20.110 
case and the best way to do that is to
talk<00:05:18.410> with<00:05:18.440> an<00:05:18.710> attorney<00:05:19.040> after<00:05:19.850> you<00:05:19.940> get<00:05:20.060> the

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
talk with an attorney after you get the

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.969 
talk with an attorney after you get the
calibration<00:05:20.720> done<00:05:20.900> definitely<00:05:21.710> talk<00:05:21.830> with

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
calibration done definitely talk with

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:23.140 
calibration done definitely talk with
someone<00:05:22.160> with<00:05:22.250> a<00:05:22.340> head<00:05:22.460> of<00:05:22.490> time<00:05:22.580> we<00:05:23.000> can

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
someone with a head of time we can

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.969 
someone with a head of time we can
usually<00:05:23.270> recommend<00:05:23.840> local<00:05:24.229> shops<00:05:24.500> to<00:05:24.740> do<00:05:24.860> the

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:24.979 
usually recommend local shops to do the

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:26.620 
usually recommend local shops to do the
calibration<00:05:25.640> and<00:05:25.880> then<00:05:26.150> once<00:05:26.300> you<00:05:26.419> get<00:05:26.510> it

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
calibration and then once you get it

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.330 
calibration and then once you get it
done<00:05:26.780> and<00:05:27.020> give<00:05:27.110> us<00:05:27.200> give<00:05:27.470> me<00:05:27.500> a<00:05:27.620> call<00:05:27.800> back<00:05:27.830> and
