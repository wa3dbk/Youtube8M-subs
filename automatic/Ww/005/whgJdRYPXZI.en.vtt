00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
the other side and the drive chain and

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.359 
the other side and the drive chain and
I'm<00:00:24.930> gonna<00:00:25.199> try<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.560> refurbish<00:00:25.949> some<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.310> the

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
I'm gonna try and refurbish some of the

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.609 
I'm gonna try and refurbish some of the
plastic<00:00:26.730> because<00:00:27.000> as<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:27.210> can<00:00:27.330> see<00:00:27.619> it's

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
plastic because as you can see it's

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.659 
plastic because as you can see it's
looking<00:00:29.460> pretty<00:00:30.590> pretty<00:00:31.590> bad<00:00:31.830> I'm<00:00:32.520> gonna

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
looking pretty pretty bad I'm gonna

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.860 
looking pretty pretty bad I'm gonna
start<00:00:33.230> by<00:00:34.230> seeing<00:00:34.710> if<00:00:34.860> this<00:00:34.920> thing<00:00:35.130> has<00:00:35.340> spark

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
start by seeing if this thing has spark

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.889 
start by seeing if this thing has spark
try<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.020> see<00:00:37.140> anyways

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
try and see anyways

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.130 
try and see anyways
luckily<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.350> previous<00:00:40.739> owner<00:00:40.980> had<00:00:42.020> run<00:00:43.020> it

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
luckily the previous owner had run it

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.770 
luckily the previous owner had run it
dry<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.410> seems<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:43.860> should<00:00:44.820> be<00:00:45.000> fairly<00:00:45.570> good

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
dry it seems so should be fairly good

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.020 
dry it seems so should be fairly good
nicking<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.110> carbon<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.530> lot<00:00:46.710> but<00:00:46.950> this<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.789> not

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
nicking the carbon a lot but this is not

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.639 
nicking the carbon a lot but this is not
going<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.450> be<00:00:48.570> one<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.870> those<00:00:48.960> how-to<00:00:51.649> videos

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
going to be one of those how-to videos

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.029 
going to be one of those how-to videos
but<00:00:52.949> this<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.160> just<00:00:53.670> sort<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.000> documentation

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
but this is just sort of a documentation

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:58.939 
but this is just sort of a documentation
not<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.160> only<00:00:56.309> thing<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.550> might<00:00:56.699> do<00:00:57.020> yeah<00:00:58.020> how

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
not the only thing I might do yeah how

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.799 
not the only thing I might do yeah how
tone<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.399> how<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.850> inspect<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.359> carburetor

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
tone is how to inspect the carburetor

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.130 
tone is how to inspect the carburetor
and<00:01:00.899> fuel<00:01:01.230> tank<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:01.890> fuel<00:01:02.190> lines<00:01:02.899> because<00:01:03.899> I

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
and fuel tank and fuel lines because I

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.500 
and fuel tank and fuel lines because I
know<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.250> hasn't<00:01:05.430> been<00:01:05.670> run<00:01:05.939> for<00:01:05.970> at<00:01:06.270> least

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
know this hasn't been run for at least

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.350 
know this hasn't been run for at least
two<00:01:06.840> years<00:01:06.869> probably<00:01:07.560> more<00:01:08.010> but<00:01:08.790> yeah<00:01:09.000> anyways

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
two years probably more but yeah anyways

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:24.700 
two years probably more but yeah anyways
let's<00:01:10.020> see<00:01:10.380> things<00:01:10.650> listing<00:01:11.100> has<00:01:11.250> spark

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.429 

inspecting<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.799> spark<00:01:26.100> plug<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.400> know<00:01:27.439> turns

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
inspecting the spark plug you know turns

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.340 
inspecting the spark plug you know turns
out<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.740> promise<00:01:29.159> something<00:01:29.490> good<00:01:30.360> let's<00:01:31.079> find

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
out to promise something good let's find

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.340 
out to promise something good let's find
out<00:01:31.610> its<00:01:32.610> type<00:01:32.970> it'll<00:01:33.240> start<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:33.960> little<00:01:34.170> bit<00:01:34.259> of

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
out its type it'll start a little bit of

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.249 
out its type it'll start a little bit of
a<00:01:34.380> carbon<00:01:34.920> buildup<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.460> oiling<00:01:35.729> but<00:01:36.720> nothing

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
a carbon buildup and oiling but nothing

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.920 
a carbon buildup and oiling but nothing
bad<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:38.189> let's<00:01:39.000> see<00:01:41.360> okay<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.540> should<00:01:42.780> have<00:01:42.899> a

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
bad so let's see okay so I should have a

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.569 
bad so let's see okay so I should have a
grounded<00:01:43.409> pretty<00:01:43.590> well<00:01:43.799> in<00:01:43.950> no<00:01:44.130> I'm<00:01:44.369> just

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
grounded pretty well in no I'm just

00:01:44.579 --> 00:02:00.109 
grounded pretty well in no I'm just
gonna<00:01:44.820> try<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.240> pull<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.810> over<00:01:58.909> okay<00:01:59.909> so<00:01:59.969> it's

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
gonna try and pull it over okay so it's

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.209 
gonna try and pull it over okay so it's
very<00:02:00.210> hard<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.600> pick<00:02:00.719> up<00:02:00.930> on<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.560> camera<00:02:01.920> but<00:02:02.070> I

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
very hard to pick up on the camera but I

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.810 
very hard to pick up on the camera but I
could<00:02:02.549> see<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:03.710> tiny<00:02:04.710> spark<00:02:05.070> there<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:05.430> I'm<00:02:05.549> just

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
could see a tiny spark there so I'm just

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.730 
could see a tiny spark there so I'm just
gonna<00:02:05.939> have<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.180> I'm<00:02:07.140> not<00:02:07.320> sure<00:02:07.439> it's<00:02:07.619> gonna

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
gonna have to I'm not sure it's gonna

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.460 
gonna have to I'm not sure it's gonna
start<00:02:08.069> with<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.310> part<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:08.759> I'm<00:02:08.879> gonna<00:02:09.209> do

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
start with that part so I'm gonna do

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.420 
start with that part so I'm gonna do
while<00:02:10.470> I<00:02:10.500> got<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.860> engine<00:02:11.069> off<00:02:11.190> I'm<00:02:11.310> gonna

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
while I got the engine off I'm gonna

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.600 
while I got the engine off I'm gonna
check<00:02:12.390> all<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:13.680> ignition<00:02:13.980> systems<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:14.550> all

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
check all the ignition systems and all

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.150 
check all the ignition systems and all
that<00:02:14.760> upon<00:02:15.660> closer<00:02:16.050> inspection<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:17.330> found<00:02:19.160> this

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
that upon closer inspection I found this

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.119 
that upon closer inspection I found this
thing<00:02:20.220> is<00:02:20.580> actually<00:02:20.790> missing<00:02:22.250> all<00:02:23.250> three
