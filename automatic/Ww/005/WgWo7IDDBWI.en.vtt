00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.860 
like you would be stalling in a silicone
case<00:02:24.840> pretty<00:02:25.650> much<00:02:25.829> exactly<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.340> same<00:02:26.549> thing

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
case pretty much exactly the same thing

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.330 
case pretty much exactly the same thing
slip<00:02:27.870> it<00:02:27.959> on<00:02:28.079> and<00:02:28.110> there<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:28.799> go<00:02:28.920> it's

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
slip it on and there you go it's

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.060 
slip it on and there you go it's
installed<00:02:30.320> there<00:02:31.320> does<00:02:31.500> seem<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.709> be<00:02:31.829> a<00:02:31.920> little

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
installed there does seem to be a little

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.650 
installed there does seem to be a little
bit<00:02:32.280> of<00:02:32.340> an<00:02:32.400> issue<00:02:32.549> with<00:02:32.940> this<00:02:33.090> case<00:02:33.329> and

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
bit of an issue with this case and

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.600 
bit of an issue with this case and
bubbling<00:02:34.290> up<00:02:34.500> on<00:02:34.739> the<00:02:34.920> corners<00:02:35.340> i<00:02:35.430> don't<00:02:35.549> know

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
bubbling up on the corners i don't know

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.670 
bubbling up on the corners i don't know
if<00:02:35.670> you'd<00:02:35.790> call<00:02:36.000> it<00:02:36.060> bubbling<00:02:36.660> or<00:02:37.440> just

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
if you'd call it bubbling or just

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.699 
if you'd call it bubbling or just
stretching<00:02:38.600> over<00:02:39.600> time<00:02:39.810> but<00:02:40.110> they<00:02:40.260> do<00:02:40.320> tend<00:02:40.590> to

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
stretching over time but they do tend to

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.370 
stretching over time but they do tend to
lift<00:02:41.070> on<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:42.120> corners<00:02:42.600> a<00:02:42.750> little<00:02:42.810> bit<00:02:43.200> this

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
lift on the corners a little bit this

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.009 
lift on the corners a little bit this
one's<00:02:43.560> not<00:02:43.680> real<00:02:43.890> bad<00:02:44.040> yet<00:02:44.370> but<00:02:45.299> the<00:02:45.570> you<00:02:45.900> can

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
one's not real bad yet but the you can

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:47.479 
one's not real bad yet but the you can
see<00:02:46.199> it's<00:02:46.380> starting<00:02:46.620> on<00:02:46.889> this<00:02:47.010> corner<00:02:47.370> right

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
see it's starting on this corner right

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:48.750 
see it's starting on this corner right
here<00:02:47.549> starting<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.180> lift

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
here starting to lift

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.910 
here starting to lift
little<00:02:48.909> bit<00:02:49.090> I<00:02:49.360> just<00:02:50.110> bought<00:02:50.290> my<00:02:50.409> camera<00:02:50.769> so<00:02:50.890> I

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
little bit I just bought my camera so I

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.660 
little bit I just bought my camera so I
put<00:02:51.129> that<00:02:51.280> guy's<00:02:52.379> um<00:02:53.379> other<00:02:54.010> than<00:02:54.129> that<00:02:54.400> I

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
put that guy's um other than that I

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:55.890 
put that guy's um other than that I
don't<00:02:54.970> have<00:02:55.180> a<00:02:55.239> whole<00:02:55.390> lot<00:02:55.420> of<00:02:55.599> complaints

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
don't have a whole lot of complaints

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.539 
don't have a whole lot of complaints
about<00:02:56.049> this<00:02:56.260> case<00:02:56.439> i<00:02:56.590> really<00:02:56.920> like<00:02:57.099> it<00:02:57.280> it<00:02:57.430> goes

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
about this case i really like it it goes

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.100 
about this case i really like it it goes
in<00:02:57.670> and<00:02:57.790> out<00:02:57.849> of<00:02:57.909> the<00:02:58.030> pocket<00:02:58.390> you<00:02:58.659> know<00:02:58.780> really

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
in and out of the pocket you know really

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.110 
in and out of the pocket you know really
easy<00:02:59.409> easier<00:02:59.920> than<00:03:00.069> silicon<00:03:00.459> case<00:03:00.730> for<00:03:00.970> sure

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
easy easier than silicon case for sure

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.550 
easy easier than silicon case for sure
because<00:03:01.360> it's<00:03:01.510> only<00:03:01.870> silicone<00:03:02.379> on<00:03:02.470> the

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
because it's only silicone on the

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.460 
because it's only silicone on the
outside<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:04.180> back<00:03:04.360> is<00:03:04.540> clear<00:03:04.780> plastic<00:03:05.019> so<00:03:05.379> it

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
outside the back is clear plastic so it

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.690 
outside the back is clear plastic so it
slides<00:03:05.650> in<00:03:05.860> and<00:03:05.950> out<00:03:06.040> of<00:03:06.099> the<00:03:06.190> pocket<00:03:06.489> pretty

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
slides in and out of the pocket pretty

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.990 
slides in and out of the pocket pretty

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:13.659 
the silicon is quite thin I didn't have

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.020 
the silicon is quite thin I didn't have
any<00:03:13.840> issues<00:03:14.170> with<00:03:14.319> any<00:03:14.500> headphones<00:03:15.030> not

to<00:03:39.760> it<00:03:39.879> at<00:03:40.510> the<00:03:40.629> bottom<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:41.620> dock<00:03:41.829> area<00:03:42.069> is<00:03:42.310> cut

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
to it at the bottom the dock area is cut

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:43.740 
to it at the bottom the dock area is cut
out<00:03:42.549> and<00:03:42.909> then<00:03:43.000> you<00:03:43.090> have<00:03:43.209> two<00:03:43.359> smaller

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
out and then you have two smaller

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.960 
out and then you have two smaller
cutouts<00:03:44.200> on<00:03:44.409> each<00:03:44.530> side<00:03:44.829> of<00:03:44.859> it<00:03:45.129> for<00:03:45.819> your

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
cutouts on each side of it for your

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.690 
cutouts on each side of it for your
microphone<00:03:46.480> and<00:03:46.780> your<00:03:47.109> speaker<00:03:47.530> I<00:03:47.709> actually

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
microphone and your speaker I actually

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.879 
microphone and your speaker I actually
really<00:03:49.269> like<00:03:49.450> this<00:03:49.659> design<00:03:50.019> I<00:03:50.349> think<00:03:50.530> it<00:03:50.739> gives

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:50.889 
really like this design I think it gives

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:52.170 
really like this design I think it gives
some<00:03:51.069> more<00:03:51.220> strength<00:03:51.549> to<00:03:51.730> the<00:03:51.819> case<00:03:52.000> to

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
some more strength to the case to

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.869 
some more strength to the case to
prevent<00:03:52.450> stretching<00:03:52.959> or<00:03:53.699> breakage<00:03:54.699> or

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:54.879 
prevent stretching or breakage or

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:56.939 
prevent stretching or breakage or
sagging<00:03:55.209> or<00:03:55.510> anything<00:03:55.750> like<00:03:55.810> that<00:03:55.949> really

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:56.949 
sagging or anything like that really

00:03:56.949 --> 00:04:00.839 
sagging or anything like that really
beefs<00:03:57.129> up<00:03:57.310> the<00:03:57.489> bottom<00:03:57.760> of<00:03:57.819> the<00:03:57.879> case<00:03:58.120> and<00:03:59.849> you

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
beefs up the bottom of the case and you

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:01.500 
beefs up the bottom of the case and you
know<00:04:00.940> you're<00:04:01.060> not<00:04:01.120> going<00:04:01.269> to<00:04:01.329> get<00:04:01.389> the

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
know you're not going to get the

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:02.909 
know you're not going to get the
stretching<00:04:01.900> and<00:04:02.019> sagging<00:04:02.470> that<00:04:02.650> you<00:04:02.739> would

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:02.919 
stretching and sagging that you would

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:05.250 
stretching and sagging that you would
get<00:04:03.669> if<00:04:03.910> it<00:04:04.060> the<00:04:04.120> whole<00:04:04.329> thing<00:04:04.599> was<00:04:04.780> completely

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
get if it the whole thing was completely

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.369 
get if it the whole thing was completely
