00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 Hello everyone and today I would like to do 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.480
 review on fifa 16 but more precisely on 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.760
 Beta Fifa Mobile now it will be 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.679
 so called and at the moment she 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.300
 Only available in the Canadian appstore. 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.700
 but create an account there will not be 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.560
 no work in general I will not tell you about 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.600
 it says i would like to share 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.630
 did you like your personal opinion 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.820
 this game is me or not in general, all by yourself 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.769
 find out i will try not given video in 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:37.440
 one take because not stupid 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:39.210
 limit here and so looks 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.040
 the main menu in this game as you can see 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.930
 everything is in english but it seems to me 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.660
 Official Vader Lisa September 22 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.430
 there will be a Russian version let's 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.410
 play the match in the offline division I 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.199
 I am the eighth and now I will show you 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.960
 unfortunately your womanâ€™s female team 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.360
 this part of the favela price range now we 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.340
 we can hardly buy any mod coupling 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.980
 Chinese and so on 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.550
 the only carriage know is bald of 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.670
 bothers 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.130
 and it costs 13 thousand gold coins to me 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.740
 it seems this nonsense of the number 15 he would 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.380
 cost a maximum of one and a half thousand to give you 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.479
 let's play a match press contain we are here 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.420
 we can change our composition 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.580
 but also just press advance as in 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.240
 Feb 15 and here we can just play 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.750
 match or choose a quick simulation 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.140
 choose a form 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.250
 I 'll take the white one my opponent will take 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.659
 some blue and red went 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.790
 management became the same as in 15 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.790
 part of us is a strike button 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.950
 tackle when we don't have a sprint sword and 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.049
 skill coupling is we can do feints 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.149
 I think I need tablets smartphones 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.790
 it looks like something stupid and still 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.829
 as on Feb. 15 and here it is decided ps we just 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.640
 we can take the ball and run away from everyone 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.070
 defenders 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.290
 I will be silent now because it is difficult 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.200
 simultaneously comment on play and you 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.590
 just can enjoy the gameplay 16 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.590
 parts 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.360
 rays 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:35.209
 that's all if you liked this 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:39.099
 video then put your thumb up 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.099
 Good luck everyone, bye everyone
