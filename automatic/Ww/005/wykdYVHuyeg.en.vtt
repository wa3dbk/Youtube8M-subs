but the vitamin C didn't work at all so

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.560 
but the vitamin C didn't work at all so
I<00:01:17.950> decided<00:01:18.280> I<00:01:18.400> was<00:01:18.520> going<00:01:18.670> to<00:01:18.729> bleach<00:01:19.030> it<00:01:19.060> and

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
I decided I was going to bleach it and

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.450 
I decided I was going to bleach it and
see<00:01:19.930> if<00:01:20.049> that<00:01:20.229> would<00:01:20.320> work<00:01:20.380> you<00:01:20.890> know<00:01:21.010> I<00:01:21.040> didn't

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
see if that would work you know I didn't

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.649 
see if that would work you know I didn't
want<00:01:21.610> to<00:01:21.700> bleach<00:01:21.850> it<00:01:21.880> that's<00:01:22.150> why<00:01:22.240> I<00:01:22.270> tried<00:01:22.540> the

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
want to bleach it that's why I tried the

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.399 
want to bleach it that's why I tried the
vitamin<00:01:22.780> C<00:01:24.240> obviously<00:01:25.240> had<00:01:25.780> to<00:01:25.900> do<00:01:26.020> something

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
vitamin C obviously had to do something

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.730 
vitamin C obviously had to do something
the<00:01:27.250> bleach<00:01:27.490> I<00:01:28.020> started<00:01:29.020> with<00:01:29.170> a<00:01:29.200> test<00:01:29.469> strip

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
the bleach I started with a test strip

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.289 
the bleach I started with a test strip
just<00:01:30.039> to<00:01:30.159> make<00:01:30.310> sure<00:01:30.340> it<00:01:30.820> was<00:01:30.939> going<00:01:31.090> to<00:01:31.180> do

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
just to make sure it was going to do

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.510 
just to make sure it was going to do
what<00:01:31.450> I<00:01:31.479> wanted<00:01:31.750> it<00:01:31.869> to<00:01:31.899> and<00:01:32.859> the<00:01:33.310> bleach

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
what I wanted it to and the bleach

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.349 
what I wanted it to and the bleach
didn't<00:01:33.880> even<00:01:34.000> save<00:01:34.299> the<00:01:34.450> blue<00:01:34.600> at<00:01:35.320> all<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:37.030> I

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:37.359 
didn't even save the blue at all so I

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:39.300 
didn't even save the blue at all so I
got<00:01:37.899> a<00:01:37.929> patient<00:01:38.289> and<00:01:38.679> just<00:01:38.859> covered<00:01:39.159> it<00:01:39.250> with

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
got a patient and just covered it with

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.920 
got a patient and just covered it with
brown

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.620 

looking<00:01:43.770> back<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.430> realize<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:45.000> probably<00:01:45.240> should

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
looking back I realize I probably should

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.390 
looking back I realize I probably should
have<00:01:45.660> gone<00:01:45.870> with<00:01:46.110> red<00:01:46.410> instead<00:01:46.830> of<00:01:46.890> brown<00:01:47.160> to

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
have gone with red instead of brown to

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.700 
have gone with red instead of brown to
cover<00:01:47.580> it<00:01:47.730> up<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:48.090> know<00:01:48.630> local<00:01:48.900> opposites<00:01:49.560> the

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
cover it up you know local opposites the

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.440 
cover it up you know local opposites the
color<00:01:49.890> wheel<00:01:50.100> thing<00:01:50.930> cancels<00:01:51.930> it<00:01:52.050> out

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
color wheel thing cancels it out

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
obviously I was inspired enough the time

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.640 
obviously I was inspired enough the time
to<00:01:55.770> think<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.330> but<00:01:57.330> you<00:01:57.870> know<00:01:58.020> Brown

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.570 
happened it looks alright for a few
weeks<00:02:00.900> and<00:02:01.200> then<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:02.070> know<00:02:02.190> the<00:02:02.340> green

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
weeks and then you know the green

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.520 
weeks and then you know the green
started<00:02:02.940> to<00:02:03.030> show<00:02:03.210> back<00:02:03.420> through<00:02:03.720> a<00:02:03.750> lot<00:02:04.230> and

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
started to show back through a lot and

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.850 
started to show back through a lot and
my<00:02:04.680> hair<00:02:04.860> was<00:02:04.980> just<00:02:05.040> as<00:02:05.400> nasty<00:02:05.810> like<00:02:06.860> poop

couldn't<00:02:12.780> stand

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.759 

so<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.430> tried<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:17.849> stay<00:02:17.969> over<00:02:18.239> with<00:02:18.359> red<00:02:18.739> the<00:02:19.739> red

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
so I tried to stay over with red the red

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.330 
so I tried to stay over with red the red
worked<00:02:20.310> for<00:02:21.379> about<00:02:22.379> another<00:02:22.590> couple<00:02:23.010> roots

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
worked for about another couple roots

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.250 
worked for about another couple roots
and<00:02:23.609> then<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.480> green<00:02:24.689> started<00:02:25.109> showing

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
and then the green started showing

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.319 
and then the green started showing
through<00:02:25.620> in<00:02:25.769> weird<00:02:26.069> places<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:26.819> it's<00:02:27.060> even

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329
