00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.540 
as much input as we can before we
release<00:02:16.420> it<00:02:16.570> in<00:02:16.660> spring<00:02:16.960> so<00:02:17.590> we're<00:02:18.220> getting<00:02:18.430> it

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550

thoroughly tested and make sure that the

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.860 
thoroughly tested and make sure that the
iteration<00:02:20.740> time<00:02:20.950> for<00:02:21.880> developers<00:02:22.330> is<00:02:22.480> as<00:02:22.600> fast
