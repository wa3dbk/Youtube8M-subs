getting around to doing the illustration
in<00:00:55.630> March<00:00:56.410> of<00:00:56.730> 2012<00:00:58.739> this<00:00:59.739> fish<00:00:59.980> was

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
in March of 2012 this fish was

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.660 
in March of 2012 this fish was
originally<00:01:00.850> preserved<00:01:01.450> in<00:01:01.809> 10%<00:01:02.770> formalin<00:01:03.430> and

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
originally preserved in 10% formalin and

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.859 
originally preserved in 10% formalin and
then<00:01:04.000> transferred<00:01:04.629> to<00:01:05.069> 70%<00:01:06.069> ethanol<00:01:06.869> formalin

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
then transferred to 70% ethanol formalin

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:09.449 
then transferred to 70% ethanol formalin
will<00:01:08.020> take<00:01:08.259> most<00:01:08.560> of<00:01:08.740> the<00:01:08.859> color<00:01:09.069> out<00:01:09.159> of<00:01:09.310> the

00:01:09.449 --> 00:01:09.459 
will take most of the color out of the

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:12.209 
will take most of the color out of the
fish<00:01:09.789> and<00:01:10.299> so<00:01:10.630> i'm<00:01:10.929> going<00:01:11.259> to<00:01:11.319> rely<00:01:11.619> mostly<00:01:11.979> on

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:12.219 
fish and so i'm going to rely mostly on

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:14.969 
fish and so i'm going to rely mostly on
my<00:01:12.639> notes<00:01:12.939> and<00:01:13.209> the<00:01:13.749> color<00:01:14.170> photos<00:01:14.709> that<00:01:14.859> I

my notes and the color photos that I

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:16.940 
my notes and the color photos that I
took<00:01:15.039> at<00:01:15.310> this<00:01:15.459> same<00:01:15.729> specimen<00:01:16.270> in<00:01:16.509> the<00:01:16.600> field

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
took at this same specimen in the field

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.309 
took at this same specimen in the field
to<00:01:17.950> apply<00:01:18.249> to<00:01:18.310> color<00:01:18.990> here's<00:01:19.990> all<00:01:20.170> his

00:01:20.309 --> 00:01:20.319 
to apply to color here's all his

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:22.559 
to apply to color here's all his
relatives<00:01:20.920> that<00:01:21.159> were<00:01:21.219> collected<00:01:21.880> same<00:01:22.149> place
