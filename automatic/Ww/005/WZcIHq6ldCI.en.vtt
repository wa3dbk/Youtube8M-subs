00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
you enough power for Eagle Ridge second

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.690

I<00:03:02.560> guess<00:03:03.560> my<00:03:03.739> only<00:03:03.770> complaint<00:03:04.400> with<00:03:04.550> this<00:03:04.700> car

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
I guess my only complaint with this car

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.530 
I guess my only complaint with this car
would<00:03:05.420> would<00:03:05.959> be<00:03:05.989> that<00:03:06.760> no<00:03:07.760> matter<00:03:07.910> how<00:03:08.150> hard<00:03:08.420> I

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
would would be that no matter how hard I

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.830 
would would be that no matter how hard I
try<00:03:08.570> I<00:03:08.870> can't<00:03:09.340> keep<00:03:10.340> my<00:03:10.400> rpm's<00:03:10.820> high<00:03:11.360> enough<00:03:11.630> in

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
try I can't keep my rpm's high enough in

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.949 
try I can't keep my rpm's high enough in
certain<00:03:12.470> areas<00:03:12.530> I<00:03:13.180> believe<00:03:14.180> like<00:03:14.300> a<00:03:14.420> wide<00:03:14.630> open

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
certain areas I believe like a wide open

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.350 
certain areas I believe like a wide open
drift<00:03:15.230> I<00:03:15.410> barely<00:03:15.920> hit<00:03:16.220> rev<00:03:16.430> limiter<00:03:16.790> I<00:03:16.970> believe

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
drift I barely hit rev limiter I believe

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.940 
drift I barely hit rev limiter I believe
I<00:03:17.450> only<00:03:17.540> hit<00:03:17.660> it<00:03:17.780> like<00:03:17.870> twice<00:03:18.260> in<00:03:18.319> this<00:03:18.739> whole

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
I only hit it like twice in this whole

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.330 
I only hit it like twice in this whole
video<00:03:19.190> and<00:03:20.110> I<00:03:21.110> don't<00:03:21.530> know<00:03:21.620> I'm<00:03:21.709> not<00:03:21.739> really<00:03:21.890> i

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
video and I don't know I'm not really i

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.660 
video and I don't know I'm not really i
don't<00:03:22.640> really<00:03:22.819> like<00:03:22.940> that<00:03:23.300> like<00:03:23.510> my<00:03:23.630> 240<00:03:24.200> i<00:03:24.230> can

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
don't really like that like my 240 i can

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.360 
don't really like that like my 240 i can
put<00:03:25.670> it<00:03:25.760> in<00:03:25.880> the<00:03:26.200> rev<00:03:27.200> limiter<00:03:27.590> whatever<00:03:28.250> i

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
put it in the rev limiter whatever i

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.720 
put it in the rev limiter whatever i
want<00:03:28.640> just<00:03:28.880> by<00:03:29.000> holding<00:03:29.269> it<00:03:29.510> down<00:03:29.540> and<00:03:30.019> then

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
want just by holding it down and then

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.500 
want just by holding it down and then
using<00:03:32.629> my<00:03:32.810> throttle<00:03:33.200> control<00:03:33.560> to<00:03:34.180> control<00:03:35.180> my

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
using my throttle control to control my

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.449 
using my throttle control to control my
drifting<00:03:35.810> that<00:03:35.989> way<00:03:36.170> but<00:03:36.860> I<00:03:36.920> don't<00:03:37.220> know<00:03:37.280> if

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
drifting that way but I don't know if

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.399 
drifting that way but I don't know if
this<00:03:37.730> still<00:03:37.940> guitar<00:03:38.360> it<00:03:38.540> has<00:03:38.690> a<00:03:38.720> really<00:03:39.200> good

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:39.409 
this still guitar it has a really good

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:44.320 
this still guitar it has a really good
balance<00:03:39.890> I<00:03:40.129> feel<00:03:40.730> like<00:03:40.970> and<00:03:43.000> yeah<00:03:44.000> just

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
balance I feel like and yeah just

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.780 
balance I feel like and yeah just
overall<00:03:44.750> it<00:03:44.989> handles<00:03:45.379> really<00:03:45.440> well<00:03:45.739> and<00:03:46.220> it's

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
overall it handles really well and it's

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.150 
overall it handles really well and it's
a<00:03:46.879> BMW<00:03:47.150> so<00:03:47.840> you<00:03:47.900> can't<00:03:48.319> really<00:03:48.379> complain<00:03:48.830> there

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
a BMW so you can't really complain there

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.800 
a BMW so you can't really complain there
most<00:03:49.910> vmw<00:03:50.569> zar<00:03:51.459> are<00:03:52.459> set<00:03:52.849> up<00:03:52.970> pretty<00:03:53.239> well<00:03:53.299> and

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
most vmw zar are set up pretty well and

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.369 
most vmw zar are set up pretty well and
this<00:03:54.080> one<00:03:55.030> you<00:03:56.030> can<00:03:56.060> definitely<00:03:56.480> tell<00:03:56.629> just<00:03:57.319> by

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:57.379 
this one you can definitely tell just by

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:01.390 
this one you can definitely tell just by
its<00:03:57.620> handling<00:03:58.180> it's<00:03:59.180> a<00:03:59.860> decent<00:04:00.860> drift<00:04:01.040> car<00:04:01.220> it

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
its handling it's a decent drift car it

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.600 
its handling it's a decent drift car it
has<00:04:01.700> really<00:04:01.879> good<00:04:01.970> balanced<00:04:02.480> kind<00:04:02.870> of<00:04:02.930> like<00:04:03.019> my

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
has really good balanced kind of like my

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.100 
has really good balanced kind of like my

my drift tutorial if you haven't seen
that<00:04:06.170> I<00:04:06.739> was<00:04:07.160> good<00:04:07.459> at<00:04:07.489> the<00:04:08.110> BMW<00:04:09.110> m3<00:04:09.650> I<00:04:10.010> believe

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
that I was good at the BMW m3 I believe

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.610 
that I was good at the BMW m3 I believe
in<00:04:10.549> its<00:04:10.670> bone<00:04:10.879> stock<00:04:11.239> and<00:04:11.599> it's<00:04:12.260> like<00:04:12.500> the

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
in its bone stock and it's like the

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.680 
in its bone stock and it's like the
perfect<00:04:12.799> beginner<00:04:13.459> drift<00:04:13.790> car<00:04:14.000> this<00:04:14.510> would

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
perfect beginner drift car this would

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.870 
perfect beginner drift car this would
also<00:04:14.720> be<00:04:15.079> another<00:04:15.739> great<00:04:15.980> beginner<00:04:16.459> difficult

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
also be another great beginner difficult

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.599 
also be another great beginner difficult
if<00:04:17.150> you<00:04:17.900> didn't<00:04:18.470> want<00:04:18.620> to<00:04:18.650> use<00:04:18.769> the<00:04:18.919> m3<00:04:19.310> this<00:04:19.489> is

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
if you didn't want to use the m3 this is

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:21.340 
if you didn't want to use the m3 this is
probably<00:04:19.789> a<00:04:19.940> little<00:04:20.000> I'm<00:04:20.690> sure<00:04:20.900> it's<00:04:21.079> a<00:04:21.109> little

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
probably a little I'm sure it's a little

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.610 
probably a little I'm sure it's a little
lighter<00:04:21.560> and<00:04:22.630> it's<00:04:23.630> a<00:04:23.720> little<00:04:23.900> smaller<00:04:24.199> so<00:04:24.350> it

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
lighter and it's a little smaller so it

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.890 
lighter and it's a little smaller so it
may<00:04:24.710> be<00:04:24.740> a<00:04:24.919> little<00:04:25.070> easier<00:04:25.310> drift<00:04:25.880> but<00:04:26.780> yeah

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
may be a little easier drift but yeah

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.800 
may be a little easier drift but yeah
overall<00:04:27.229> this<00:04:27.440> is<00:04:27.500> a<00:04:27.880> decent<00:04:28.880> drift<00:04:29.300> car<00:04:29.510> not

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
overall this is a decent drift car not

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.320 
overall this is a decent drift car not
my<00:04:29.960> favorite<00:04:30.380> but<00:04:30.410> it<00:04:31.160> does<00:04:31.400> drift<00:04:31.669> fairly

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
my favorite but it does drift fairly

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.090 
my favorite but it does drift fairly
