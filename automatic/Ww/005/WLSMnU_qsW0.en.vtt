there um I think the relationship was
still<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.030> same<00:00:54.239> i<00:00:54.360> think<00:00:54.539> i<00:00:54.629> had<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.960> girl

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
still the same i think i had a girl

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.560 
still the same i think i had a girl
issue<00:00:55.320> with<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.559> players<00:00:55.770> before<00:00:56.129> i<00:00:56.340> was<00:00:56.489> a

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
issue with the players before i was a

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.119 
issue with the players before i was a
starter<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.719> it's<00:00:58.289> been<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.590> way<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:59.039> know

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
starter and it's been that way you know

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.830 
starter and it's been that way you know
since<00:00:59.340> i've<00:00:59.460> been<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.670> starter<00:00:59.969> i<00:01:00.030> think<00:01:00.270> the

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
since i've been the starter i think the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.060 
since i've been the starter i think the
biggest<00:01:01.020> thing<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.320> i<00:01:01.469> had<00:01:01.590> in<00:01:01.620> my<00:01:01.770> head<00:01:01.890> was

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
biggest thing that i had in my head was

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.460 
biggest thing that i had in my head was
just<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.430> earn<00:01:02.550> more<00:01:02.789> respect<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.480> that's<00:01:04.409> the

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
just to earn more respect and that's the

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.109 
just to earn more respect and that's the
only<00:01:04.530> thing<00:01:04.769> i<00:01:04.890> could<00:01:04.949> do<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.519> way<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.909> do

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
only thing i could do and the way to do

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.539 
only thing i could do and the way to do
that<00:01:06.240> would<00:01:06.330> be<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.450> work<00:01:06.659> hard<00:01:07.400> show<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.490> on

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549
