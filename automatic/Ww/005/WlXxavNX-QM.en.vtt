00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
I think that's how it's pronounced going

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.040 
I think that's how it's pronounced going
to<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.989> pictures<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.590> him<00:00:41.190> or<00:00:41.550> her<00:00:42.510> would<00:00:42.960> you

the<00:02:02.460> way<00:02:02.579> down<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.390> tail<00:02:03.659> is<00:02:04.100> also<00:02:05.100> very

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
the way down and the tail is also very

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.490 
the way down and the tail is also very
good<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.640> like<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.969> color<00:02:06.240> combos<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:07.110> like<00:02:07.350> the

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
ride and the red and green as well on

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.800 
ride and the red and green as well on
the<00:02:10.319> spikes

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
the spikes

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.050 
the spikes
and<00:02:11.900> it's<00:02:12.290> really<00:02:12.500> a<00:02:12.620> fantastic<00:02:12.860> dragon<00:02:13.849> and

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
and it's really a fantastic dragon and

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.750 
and it's really a fantastic dragon and
Chinese<00:02:14.930> dragons<00:02:15.380> and<00:02:16.630> I<00:02:17.830> like<00:02:18.830> these<00:02:19.459> kind<00:02:19.730> of

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
Chinese dragons and I like these kind of

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.820 
Chinese dragons and I like these kind of
slapstick<00:02:20.420> has<00:02:20.599> to<00:02:20.720> kind<00:02:20.930> of<00:02:21.020> go<00:02:21.140> out<00:02:21.319> so<00:02:21.709> it

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
slapstick has to kind of go out so it

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.030 
slapstick has to kind of go out so it
looks<00:02:21.860> a<00:02:22.160> bit<00:02:22.190> like<00:02:22.670> like<00:02:23.420> wings<00:02:23.830> like<00:02:24.830> it

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
looks a bit like like wings like it

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.550 
looks a bit like like wings like it
could<00:02:25.430> have<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:25.640> same<00:02:25.819> effect<00:02:26.360> as<00:02:26.630> a<00:02:26.930> shoot<00:02:27.290> as

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
could have the same effect as a shoot as

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.620 
could have the same effect as a shoot as
a<00:02:27.590> parachute<00:02:28.130> and<00:02:28.459> when<00:02:29.030> like<00:02:29.360> when<00:02:29.390> he's

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
a parachute and when like when he's

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.360 
a parachute and when like when he's
jumping<00:02:29.870> and<00:02:30.170> he<00:02:30.230> could<00:02:30.380> probably<00:02:30.530> slow<00:02:31.340> down

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
jumping and he could probably slow down

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.360 
jumping and he could probably slow down
using<00:02:31.910> those<00:02:32.680> maybe<00:02:33.680> it's<00:02:33.860> just<00:02:33.950> me<00:02:34.220> but

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
using those maybe it's just me but

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.040 
using those maybe it's just me but
that's<00:02:34.489> that's<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.060> idea<00:02:35.330> I<00:02:35.390> get<00:02:35.630> when<00:02:35.780> I<00:02:35.810> see

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.400 
that's that's the idea I get when I see
it<00:02:36.110> but<00:02:36.489> yeah<00:02:37.489> and<00:02:38.269> really<00:02:38.840> degenerated

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
it but yeah and really degenerated

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.320 
it but yeah and really degenerated

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
same thing it might be wrong but anyway

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.670
