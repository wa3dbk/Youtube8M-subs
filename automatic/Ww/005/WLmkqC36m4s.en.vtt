00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.810 
few little rivalries and maybe a few
words<00:00:53.390> exchanged<00:00:54.199> on<00:00:54.320> the<00:00:54.440> court<00:00:54.769> but<00:00:54.980> um<00:00:55.430> yeah

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.040 

the<00:01:04.580> type<00:01:04.940> of<00:01:04.970> tactics<00:01:05.420> that<00:01:05.509> i'll<00:01:05.720> pull<00:01:05.960> out

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
the type of tactics that i'll pull out

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.090 
the type of tactics that i'll pull out
on<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:06.289> court<00:01:06.590> I<00:01:06.970> guess<00:01:07.970> it's<00:01:08.180> probably<00:01:08.390> more

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
on the court I guess it's probably more

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.740 
on the court I guess it's probably more
hard<00:01:10.100> bowling<00:01:10.340> I<00:01:10.640> go<00:01:10.880> half<00:01:11.119> pretty<00:01:11.420> much<00:01:11.570> at

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
hard bowling I go half pretty much at

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.469 
hard bowling I go half pretty much at
the<00:01:11.780> ball<00:01:12.020> and<00:01:12.050> a<00:01:12.820> little<00:01:13.820> bit<00:01:13.910> aggressive<00:01:14.330> now

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
the ball and a little bit aggressive now

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.529 
the ball and a little bit aggressive now
and<00:01:14.630> then<00:01:14.780> so<00:01:15.289> I<00:01:15.789> wouldn't<00:01:16.789> call<00:01:16.910> it<00:01:17.030> a<00:01:17.119> tactics

00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:17.539 
and then so I wouldn't call it a tactics

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:19.330 
and then so I wouldn't call it a tactics
the<00:01:17.869> way<00:01:17.960> play<00:01:18.229> but<00:01:18.530> he<00:01:18.590> fails<00:01:18.800> to<00:01:18.890> tell<00:01:19.130> you<00:01:19.220> my

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
the way play but he fails to tell you my

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:26.660 
the way play but he fails to tell you my
secrets<00:01:19.789> i'm<00:01:19.940> not<00:01:20.090> going<00:01:20.240> to

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.459 

in<00:01:27.670> the<00:01:27.969> gold<00:01:28.179> medal<00:01:28.329> match<00:01:28.479> it<00:01:28.929> was<00:01:29.140> so

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:29.469 
in the gold medal match it was so

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:32.429 
in the gold medal match it was so
exciting<00:01:30.039> it<00:01:30.969> was<00:01:31.090> exhilarating<00:01:31.450> and<00:01:32.020> to<00:01:32.229> get

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439 
exciting it was exhilarating and to get

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:35.039 
exciting it was exhilarating and to get
back<00:01:32.649> to<00:01:33.039> even<00:01:33.640> to<00:01:33.999> go<00:01:34.090> into<00:01:34.240> extra<00:01:34.509> time<00:01:34.750> was

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
back to even to go into extra time was

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:36.660 
back to even to go into extra time was
great<00:01:35.289> but<00:01:35.770> obviously<00:01:36.069> the<00:01:36.250> result<00:01:36.549> was

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
great but obviously the result was

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.849 
great but obviously the result was
really<00:01:37.000> disappointing<00:01:37.630> I<00:01:37.810> think<00:01:38.560> it<00:01:38.619> was<00:01:38.649> such

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:38.859 
really disappointing I think it was such

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:40.949 
really disappointing I think it was such
a<00:01:38.890> close<00:01:39.159> game<00:01:39.600> anyone<00:01:40.600> could<00:01:40.780> want

00:01:40.949 --> 00:01:40.959 
a close game anyone could want

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:42.990 
a close game anyone could want
unfortunately<00:01:41.709> it<00:01:41.770> was<00:01:41.859> enough<00:01:42.130> if<00:01:42.819> I'm

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
unfortunately it was enough if I'm

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.399 
unfortunately it was enough if I'm
selected<00:01:43.209> in<00:01:43.539> the<00:01:43.600> world<00:01:43.780> championship<00:01:44.200> I
