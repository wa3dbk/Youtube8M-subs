00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
more ambitious and adventurous and just

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.340 
more ambitious and adventurous and just
bigger<00:02:05.399> so<00:02:06.090> like<00:02:06.390> I<00:02:06.420> said<00:02:06.659> we<00:02:06.990> pretty<00:02:07.259> much

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
bigger so like I said we pretty much

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.990 
bigger so like I said we pretty much
could<00:02:07.649> guess<00:02:07.860> that<00:02:07.890> they<00:02:08.220> were<00:02:08.280> coming<00:02:08.819> back

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
could guess that they were coming back

could guess that they were coming back
some<00:02:09.690> people<00:02:09.899> want<00:02:09.989> to<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.200> storyline<00:02:10.560> but<00:02:10.679> it

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
some people want to the storyline but it

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.320 
some people want to the storyline but it
looks<00:02:11.009> like<00:02:11.160> it<00:02:11.340> probably<00:02:11.760> might<00:02:11.940> be<00:02:12.120> just

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
looks like it probably might be just

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.550 
looks like it probably might be just
Easter<00:02:12.690> eggs<00:02:12.810> again<00:02:12.959> which

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
Easter eggs again which

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.949 
Easter eggs again which
basically<00:02:14.250> its<00:02:14.370> own<00:02:14.520> storyline<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.390> just

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
basically its own storyline and just

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.990 
basically its own storyline and just
many<00:02:16.230> clips<00:02:16.650> i<00:02:16.800> guess<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.099> could<00:02:17.250> say<00:02:17.400> also<00:02:17.790> he

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
many clips i guess you could say also he

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.199 
many clips i guess you could say also he
mentions<00:02:18.390> character<00:02:19.319> developments<00:02:20.209> possibly

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
meaning new characters maybe the old

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.910 
meaning new characters maybe the old
coats<00:02:23.190> or<00:02:23.580> just<00:02:23.790> improvements<00:02:24.510> on<00:02:24.920> characters

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920

at least the zombies team put a lot of

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.800 
at least the zombies team put a lot of
detail<00:02:38.069> in<00:02:38.280> this<00:02:38.550> and<00:02:38.819> then<00:02:38.910> and<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.420> fact

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
detail in this and then and the fact

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.059 
detail in this and then and the fact
that<00:02:39.870> they<00:02:40.050> actually<00:02:40.110> had<00:02:40.440> three<00:02:40.739> years<00:02:40.950> to

that they actually had three years to
develop<00:02:41.370> it<00:02:41.760> when<00:02:42.269> usually<00:02:42.480> they<00:02:42.690> would<00:02:42.930> have

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
develop it when usually they would have

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.290 
develop it when usually they would have
to<00:02:43.110> means<00:02:43.860> they<00:02:44.010> could<00:02:44.069> do<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.310> lot<00:02:44.730> more<00:02:44.760> with

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
to means they could do a lot more with

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.850 
to means they could do a lot more with
these<00:02:45.450> zombies<00:02:45.810> maps<00:02:46.049> and<00:02:46.200> he<00:02:46.260> says<00:02:46.440> every

these zombies maps and he says every

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.330 
these zombies maps and he says every

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
corner you know has something in it so

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.890 
corner you know has something in it so
happy<00:02:50.670> corner<00:02:50.850> has<00:02:51.120> dro<00:02:51.269> studied<00:02:51.569> you<00:02:51.750> know<00:02:51.870> a

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
happy corner has dro studied you know a

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.340 
happy corner has dro studied you know a
bit<00:02:52.140> more<00:02:52.170> detail<00:02:52.769> into<00:02:53.040> it<00:02:53.580> so<00:02:53.760> possibly<00:02:54.180> this

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
bit more detail into it so possibly this

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.180 
bit more detail into it so possibly this
means<00:02:55.350> that<00:02:55.410> there<00:02:55.560> are<00:02:55.620> going<00:02:55.680> to<00:02:55.799> be<00:02:55.860> loads
