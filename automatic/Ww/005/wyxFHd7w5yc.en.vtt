00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
in Garry's Mod now I already have it for

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.560 
in Garry's Mod now I already have it for
my<00:00:11.250> gmod<00:00:11.790> and<00:00:12.530> currently<00:00:13.530> I'm<00:00:13.920> using<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.700> Mac<00:00:15.210> a

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
my gmod and currently I'm using a Mac a

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.849 
my gmod and currently I'm using a Mac a
MacBook<00:00:16.170> Pro<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.619> be<00:00:16.859> exact<00:00:17.250> so<00:00:18.410> this<00:00:19.410> is<00:00:19.710> going

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
MacBook Pro to be exact so this is going

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.490 
MacBook Pro to be exact so this is going
to<00:00:19.920> be<00:00:20.039> for<00:00:20.279> Mac<00:00:20.490> users<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.330> think<00:00:22.199> that<00:00:22.350> the

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
to be for Mac users I think that the

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.890 
to be for Mac users I think that the
same<00:00:22.890> thing<00:00:23.250> can<00:00:23.430> work<00:00:23.580> for<00:00:23.760> Windows<00:00:24.119> it's

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
same thing can work for Windows it's

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.050 
same thing can work for Windows it's
just<00:00:25.080> slightly<00:00:25.289> different<00:00:25.830> but<00:00:26.010> most<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:26.939> it

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
just slightly different but most of it

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.939 
just slightly different but most of it

Fortress<00:01:34.290> two<00:01:34.920> add-ons<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.579> would<00:01:35.790> recommend

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
Fortress two add-ons I would recommend

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.859

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
have a lot of counter-strike source maps

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.230 
have a lot of counter-strike source maps
and<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:43.079> don't<00:01:43.140> know<00:01:43.320> content<00:01:44.250> add<00:01:44.490> ons<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:45.090> all

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
and I don't know content add ons and all

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.880 
and I don't know content add ons and all
that<00:01:45.450> other<00:01:45.570> stuff<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:46.470> need<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.619> click<00:01:46.799> on

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
that other stuff you need to click on

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.480 
that other stuff you need to click on
this<00:01:47.070> one<00:01:48.530> yes<00:01:49.530> typically<00:01:51.020> now<00:01:52.020> yeah<00:01:52.350> so<00:01:52.530> your

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
this one yes typically now yeah so your

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.959 
this one yes typically now yeah so your
basically<00:01:55.070> unless<00:01:56.070> if<00:01:56.219> you<00:01:56.310> want<00:01:56.520> Maps

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
basically unless if you want Maps

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.179 
basically unless if you want Maps
so<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:57.899> would<00:01:58.350> recommend<00:01:58.500> clicking<00:01:58.979> on<00:01:59.070> this

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
so I would recommend clicking on this

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.240 
so I would recommend clicking on this
one<00:01:59.369> because<00:01:59.490> this<00:01:59.729> does<00:01:59.969> add<00:02:00.210> ons<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.719> maps

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
one because this does add ons and maps

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.340 
one because this does add ons and maps
okay<00:02:02.250> now<00:02:02.850> what<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.299> do<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:03.750> once<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.110> get<00:02:04.229> to
