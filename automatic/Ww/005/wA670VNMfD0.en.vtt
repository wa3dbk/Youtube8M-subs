through<00:00:20.340> now<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.029> biggest<00:00:21.240> problem<00:00:21.779> with<00:00:21.900> the

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
through now the biggest problem with the

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.750 
through now the biggest problem with the
Pekka<00:00:22.230> is<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.710> fact<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:23.189> they're<00:00:23.460> pretty

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
Pekka is the fact that they're pretty

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.550 
Pekka is the fact that they're pretty
slow<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:24.359> when<00:00:24.510> getting<00:00:24.720> hit<00:00:24.840> by<00:00:24.930> archers<00:00:25.350> or

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
slow so when getting hit by archers or

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.109 
slow so when getting hit by archers or
even<00:00:25.800> worse<00:00:25.949> wizards<00:00:26.369> in<00:00:26.460> that<00:00:26.609> situation

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
even worse wizards in that situation

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.450 
even worse wizards in that situation
they<00:00:27.869> can<00:00:28.199> go<00:00:28.410> down<00:00:28.590> faster<00:00:29.189> than<00:00:29.220> you'd

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
they can go down faster than you'd

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.040 
they can go down faster than you'd

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
ridiculous now I understand that that's

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.510 
ridiculous now I understand that that's
a<00:01:12.750> complete<00:01:13.229> overkill<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.890> mean<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.250> don't<00:01:14.400> need

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
a complete overkill I mean I don't need

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.399 
a complete overkill I mean I don't need
to<00:01:14.610> do<00:01:14.700> thousands<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.360> damage<00:01:15.600> per<00:01:15.780> second<00:01:16.170> to

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
to do thousands of damage per second to

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.710 
to do thousands of damage per second to
an<00:01:16.710> air<00:01:16.920> defense<00:01:17.100> or<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.880> gold<00:01:18.450> mine<00:01:18.689> or

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
an air defense or a a gold mine or

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.539 
an air defense or a a gold mine or
anything<00:01:19.140> like<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.439> because<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.159> pega<00:01:20.369> can

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
anything like that because the pega can

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.340 
anything like that because the pega can
only<00:01:20.670> attack<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.270> fast<00:01:21.600> it's<00:01:21.810> really<00:01:21.930> not<00:01:22.140> that

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
only attack so fast it's really not that

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.350 
only attack so fast it's really not that
necessary<00:01:22.890> but<00:01:23.490> still<00:01:23.759> makes<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.119> kind<00:01:24.299> of

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
necessary but still makes it kind of

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.969 
necessary but still makes it kind of
cool<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.600> talk<00:01:24.780> about<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.320> it's<00:01:25.500> always<00:01:25.770> fun

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
cool to talk about and it's always fun

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.160 
cool to talk about and it's always fun
to<00:01:26.009> over<00:01:26.400> kill<00:01:26.580> opponents<00:01:26.720> now<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.780> pec<00:01:28.020> are

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
to over kill opponents now the pec are

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.050 
to over kill opponents now the pec are
going<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.619> split<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.100> base<00:01:29.280> which<00:01:29.549> actually

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
going to split the base which actually

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.609 
going to split the base which actually
is<00:01:30.150> probably<00:01:30.329> better<00:01:30.810> they<00:01:31.049> solve<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.380> lot<00:01:31.530> of

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
is probably better they solve a lot of

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.440 
is probably better they solve a lot of
health<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.220> it's<00:01:32.670> gonna<00:01:32.790> allow<00:01:32.909> them<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.270> take

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
health and it's gonna allow them to take

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.969 
health and it's gonna allow them to take
out<00:01:33.570> more<00:01:33.720> targets<00:01:34.110> faster<00:01:34.290> because<00:01:34.890> the

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
out more targets faster because the

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.710 
out more targets faster because the
Pekka<00:01:35.159> are<00:01:35.340> pretty<00:01:35.549> slow<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:36.180> mean<00:01:36.390> they're<00:01:36.540> one

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
Pekka are pretty slow I mean they're one

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.600 
Pekka are pretty slow I mean they're one
swipe<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.140> gonna<00:01:37.350> take<00:01:37.500> out<00:01:37.680> anything<00:01:38.070> just

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
swipe is gonna take out anything just

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.980 
swipe is gonna take out anything just
about<00:01:38.820> one<00:01:39.030> hit<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.360> there's<00:01:39.509> no<00:01:39.630> need<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.810> have

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
about one hit so there's no need to have

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.840 
about one hit so there's no need to have
five<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.350> them<00:01:40.590> against<00:01:40.950> one<00:01:41.130> target<00:01:41.579> there's

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
five of them against one target there's

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.160 
five of them against one target there's
not<00:01:42.000> much<00:01:42.150> left<00:01:42.299> on<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:42.570> base<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.020> they<00:01:43.079> have

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
not much left on this base and they have

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.300 
not much left on this base and they have
a<00:01:43.200> lot<00:01:43.320> of<00:01:43.350> health<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:43.740> things<00:01:43.979> are<00:01:44.100> looking

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
a lot of health so things are looking

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.139 
a lot of health so things are looking
pretty<00:01:44.460> up<00:01:44.640> I'm<00:01:44.790> gonna<00:01:44.880> go<00:01:45.000> ahead<00:01:45.060> and

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
pretty up I'm gonna go ahead and

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.609 
pretty up I'm gonna go ahead and
fast-forward<00:01:45.540> things<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:45.990> little<00:01:46.079> bit<00:01:46.259> here

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
fast-forward things a little bit here

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.859 
fast-forward things a little bit here
now<00:01:47.579> these<00:01:47.729> three<00:01:48.090> Tesla's<00:01:48.479> look<00:01:48.600> like<00:01:48.750> they

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
now these three Tesla's look like they

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.149 
now these three Tesla's look like they
might<00:01:49.049> give<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.350> Pekka<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.680> little<00:01:49.950> bit<00:01:50.070> of

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
might give the Pekka a little bit of

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.950 
might give the Pekka a little bit of
trouble<00:01:50.490> but<00:01:50.640> these<00:01:50.790> are<00:01:50.970> level<00:01:51.240> 5<00:01:51.540> Pekka

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
trouble but these are level 5 Pekka

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.630 
trouble but these are level 5 Pekka
they've<00:01:52.229> got<00:01:52.439> no<00:01:52.710> problem<00:01:53.159> ripping<00:01:53.430> through

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
things they're gonna take that Tesla and

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.560 
things they're gonna take that Tesla and

could just leave it I don't know the
other<00:02:18.450> way

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
other way

few things to take out let's

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.170 
few things to take out let's
fast-forward<00:02:22.380> through<00:02:22.770> this<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.340> lesson<00:02:24.120> of

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
fast-forward through this and lesson of
