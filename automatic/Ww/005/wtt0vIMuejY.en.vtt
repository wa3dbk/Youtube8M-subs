the<00:06:09.070> race<00:06:09.250> of<00:06:09.280> God<00:06:09.720> that<00:06:10.720> we<00:06:11.080> can<00:06:11.440> separate

death<00:06:48.610> we<00:06:48.909> missed<00:06:49.150> the<00:06:49.270> mark<00:06:49.449> of<00:06:49.689> everlasting

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:50.050 
death we missed the mark of everlasting

death we missed the mark of everlasting
life<00:06:50.400> through<00:06:51.400> union<00:06:51.580> with<00:06:51.909> God<00:06:52.150> and<00:06:53.279> so<00:06:54.279> that

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:54.520 
life through union with God and so that

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.820 
life through union with God and so that
death<00:06:54.789> as<00:06:54.969> the<00:06:55.419> wages<00:06:55.779> of<00:06:55.900> sin<00:06:56.139> becomes<00:06:56.590> when

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:56.830 
death as the wages of sin becomes when

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.480 
death as the wages of sin becomes when
we<00:06:56.949> are<00:06:57.099> separated<00:06:57.789> from<00:06:57.999> the<00:06:58.569> source<00:06:58.810> of<00:06:59.020> life

00:06:59.480 --> 00:06:59.490 
we are separated from the source of life

we are separated from the source of life
in<00:07:00.490> death<00:07:00.819> is<00:07:00.999> inevitable<00:07:01.589> when<00:07:02.589> God<00:07:02.860> said<00:07:03.249> to

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:03.490 
in death is inevitable when God said to

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.820 
in death is inevitable when God said to
Adam<00:07:03.639> if<00:07:04.539> you<00:07:04.779> eat<00:07:04.960> of<00:07:05.110> the<00:07:05.199> fruit<00:07:05.319> you<00:07:05.589> shall

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:08.650 
surely die he did not say if you eat of

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:10.589 
surely die he did not say if you eat of
the<00:07:08.770> fruit<00:07:08.889> I<00:07:09.159> will<00:07:09.310> execute<00:07:09.699> you<00:07:10.060> or<00:07:10.270> I<00:07:10.300> will

the fruit I will execute you or I will
surely<00:07:10.779> kill<00:07:11.139> you<00:07:11.669> but<00:07:12.669> if<00:07:12.939> you<00:07:13.180> separate

00:07:13.829 --> 00:07:13.839 
surely kill you but if you separate

00:07:13.839 --> 00:07:16.070 
surely kill you but if you separate
yourself<00:07:14.080> from<00:07:14.499> me<00:07:14.919> the<00:07:15.189> source<00:07:15.460> of<00:07:15.729> life

yourself from me the source of life

yourself from me the source of life
through<00:07:17.080> your<00:07:17.199> own<00:07:17.379> choices<00:07:18.029> then<00:07:19.029> death<00:07:19.360> is
