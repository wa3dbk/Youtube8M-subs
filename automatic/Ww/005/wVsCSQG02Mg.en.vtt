00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
in our picture frames food I'm pretty

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.200 
in our picture frames food I'm pretty
organized<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.739> really<00:01:05.129> do<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.700> lot<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:06.000> bins

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
organized so I really do a lot of bins

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.490 
organized so I really do a lot of bins
and<00:01:06.450> things<00:01:06.630> like<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:06.810> because<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.380> have

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
and things like that because you have

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.020 
and things like that because you have
very<00:01:07.710> limited<00:01:07.890> space<00:01:08.189> when<00:01:08.580> you're<00:01:08.670> in<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.820> dorm

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
very limited space when you're in a dorm

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.130 
very limited space when you're in a dorm
room<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.420> think<00:01:09.510> really<00:01:09.750> kind<00:01:10.080> of

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
room so I think really kind of

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.109 
room so I think really kind of
strategically<00:01:11.040> plan<00:01:11.369> where<00:01:11.670> all<00:01:11.790> my<00:01:11.880> things

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119
