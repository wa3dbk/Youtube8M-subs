you have it this is the slipper gear go
ahead<00:01:59.990> just<00:02:00.259> pull<00:02:00.530> that<00:02:00.560> right<00:02:00.679> out<00:02:00.859> and<00:02:01.219> what

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
ahead just pull that right out and what

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.419 
ahead just pull that right out and what
you<00:02:01.850> see<00:02:02.060> coming<00:02:02.240> out<00:02:02.450> there<00:02:02.719> is<00:02:02.869> the<00:02:03.429> drive

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
you see coming out there is the drive

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:09.040 
you see coming out there is the drive
shaft<00:02:04.759> that<00:02:05.210> can<00:02:06.109> stay<00:02:06.350> in<00:02:06.499> there<00:02:07.899> we're<00:02:08.899> not

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
shaft that can stay in there we're not

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.620 
shaft that can stay in there we're not
replacing<00:02:09.350> that<00:02:09.830> so<00:02:11.020> here<00:02:12.020> it<00:02:12.110> is<00:02:13.630> slipper

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
replacing that so here it is slipper

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:22.120 
replacing that so here it is slipper
gear<00:02:16.990> it's<00:02:17.990> fine<00:02:18.350> but<00:02:20.440> you<00:02:21.440> can<00:02:21.590> upgrade<00:02:21.740> it<00:02:22.100> to

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
gear it's fine but you can upgrade it to

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.200 
gear it's fine but you can upgrade it to
a<00:02:22.660> center<00:02:23.660> diff<00:02:24.430> which<00:02:25.430> is<00:02:25.610> actually<00:02:25.970> pretty

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
a center diff which is actually pretty

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.270 
a center diff which is actually pretty
nice<00:02:26.420> this<00:02:27.350> way<00:02:27.560> you're

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
nice this way you're

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.680 
nice this way you're
power<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.460> the<00:02:30.580> front<00:02:30.880> and<00:02:31.030> power<00:02:31.240> to<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.480> back

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
power to the front and power to the back

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.420 
power to the front and power to the back
is<00:02:32.020> is<00:02:32.950> not<00:02:33.840> locked<00:02:34.840> together<00:02:35.110> so<00:02:35.500> it's<00:02:35.650> not<00:02:35.770> 50

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
is is not locked together so it's not 50

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.010 
is is not locked together so it's not 50
or<00:02:36.550> 100<00:02:36.940> percent<00:02:37.150> of<00:02:37.210> the<00:02:37.270> front<00:02:37.450> 100<00:02:37.750> club<00:02:37.900> to

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
or 100 percent of the front 100 club to

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.470 
or 100 percent of the front 100 club to
the<00:02:38.110> back<00:02:38.290> depending<00:02:39.100> on<00:02:39.370> your<00:02:39.640> driving

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
the back depending on your driving

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.540 
the back depending on your driving
condition<00:02:41.080> it<00:02:41.380> will<00:02:41.620> actually<00:02:44.370> move<00:02:45.370> the

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
condition it will actually move the

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.160 
condition it will actually move the
torque<00:02:45.820> back<00:02:46.000> and<00:02:46.180> forth<00:02:47.040> okay<00:02:48.630> so<00:02:49.630> this<00:02:49.960> is

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
torque back and forth okay so this is

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.870 
torque back and forth okay so this is
the<00:02:50.730> replacement<00:02:51.730> centered<00:02:52.570> if<00:02:52.780> here<00:02:53.880> the

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
the replacement centered if here the

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.700 
the replacement centered if here the
thing<00:02:55.090> to<00:02:55.210> note<00:02:55.390> is<00:02:55.630> if<00:02:55.900> you're<00:02:56.290> just<00:02:56.500> going<00:02:56.650> to

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
thing to note is if you're just going to

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.960 
thing to note is if you're just going to
do<00:02:56.920> a<00:02:58.290> straight<00:02:59.290> replacement<00:03:00.010> make<00:03:00.550> sure<00:03:00.730> that

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
do a straight replacement make sure that

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:11.990 
do a straight replacement make sure that
the<00:03:06.450> spur<00:03:07.450> gear<00:03:07.480> on<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.140> old<00:03:09.000> diff<00:03:10.000> here<00:03:10.300> is

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
the spur gear on the old diff here is

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.520 
the spur gear on the old diff here is
the<00:03:13.000> same<00:03:13.210> number<00:03:13.420> of<00:03:13.540> tooth<00:03:13.900> as<00:03:14.140> the<00:03:14.320> one<00:03:14.500> that

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
the same number of tooth as the one that

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.670 
the same number of tooth as the one that
you're<00:03:14.800> replacing<00:03:15.100> this<00:03:15.580> one<00:03:15.790> is<00:03:15.940> 54<00:03:16.930> and<00:03:17.140> 54

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
you're replacing this one is 54 and 54

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.920 
you're replacing this one is 54 and 54
so<00:03:18.150> it<00:03:19.150> matches<00:03:21.060> but<00:03:22.060> even<00:03:22.390> though<00:03:22.630> that<00:03:22.810> it

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
so it matches but even though that it

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.400 
so it matches but even though that it
doesn't<00:03:23.260> match<00:03:23.380> what<00:03:23.830> we<00:03:23.950> want<00:03:24.130> to<00:03:24.220> do<00:03:24.400> too<00:03:24.640> is

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
doesn't match what we want to do too is

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.260 
doesn't match what we want to do too is
mesh<00:03:26.410> the<00:03:28.500> opinion<00:03:29.500> to<00:03:29.650> the<00:03:29.890> spur<00:03:30.220> gear<00:03:30.270> but

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
mesh the opinion to the spur gear but

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.340 
mesh the opinion to the spur gear but
the<00:03:31.560> process<00:03:32.560> in<00:03:33.600> putting<00:03:34.600> this<00:03:34.660> back<00:03:34.870> in<00:03:35.140> is

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
the process in putting this back in is

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.890 
the process in putting this back in is
just<00:03:35.680> as<00:03:35.830> easy<00:03:36.010> as<00:03:36.190> it<00:03:36.400> was<00:03:36.460> to<00:03:36.730> take<00:03:36.880> it<00:03:36.940> out<00:03:37.150> so

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
just as easy as it was to take it out so

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.240 
just as easy as it was to take it out so
this<00:03:38.740> end<00:03:39.070> goes<00:03:39.660> right<00:03:40.660> in<00:03:40.810> there<00:03:41.020> fish<00:03:41.980> around

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
this end goes right in there fish around

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:50.520 
this end goes right in there fish around
to<00:03:42.580> find<00:03:42.880> the<00:03:45.060> aluminum<00:03:46.560> driveshaft<00:03:49.290> as<00:03:50.290> you

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
to find the aluminum driveshaft as you

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.200 
to find the aluminum driveshaft as you
can<00:03:50.650> see<00:03:50.800> this<00:03:50.920> bearing<00:03:51.400> right<00:03:51.550> there<00:03:51.820> right

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 
can see this bearing right there right

00:03:52.210 --> 00:04:08.780 
can see this bearing right there right
it<00:03:52.360> needs<00:03:52.960> to<00:03:53.170> be<00:03:53.290> seated<00:03:53.800> on<00:03:54.040> the<00:03:56.040> chassis

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.119 

okay<00:04:09.989> so<00:04:10.989> there<00:04:11.230> it<00:04:11.349> is<00:04:11.409> it's<00:04:11.680> just<00:04:11.709> a<00:04:11.920> matter

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:12.129 
okay so there it is it's just a matter

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:18.120 
okay so there it is it's just a matter
of<00:04:13.829> fishing<00:04:14.829> the<00:04:15.150> end<00:04:16.229> of<00:04:17.229> this<00:04:17.350> shaft<00:04:17.739> here

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
of fishing the end of this shaft here

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.360 
of fishing the end of this shaft here
onto<00:04:18.910> the<00:04:19.150> opening<00:04:20.139> in<00:04:20.259> the<00:04:20.340> drive<00:04:21.340> shaft<00:04:21.639> so

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
onto the opening in the drive shaft so

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.300 
onto the opening in the drive shaft so
as<00:04:24.370> you<00:04:24.490> can<00:04:24.580> see<00:04:24.789> it's<00:04:24.940> in<00:04:25.060> place<00:04:26.220> for<00:04:27.220> this

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
as you can see it's in place for this

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.740 
as you can see it's in place for this
demonstration<00:04:27.820> I'm<00:04:28.060> not<00:04:28.210> gonna<00:04:28.330> do<00:04:28.419> the<00:04:28.509> gear

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
diff in place now you can just go right

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.290 
diff in place now you can just go right
ahead<00:04:45.430> and<00:04:47.039> slide<00:04:48.039> the<00:04:48.340> rear<00:04:48.580> assembly<00:04:48.910> back

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
ahead and slide the rear assembly back

00:04:49.300 --> 00:05:00.200 
ahead and slide the rear assembly back
on<00:04:50.550> okay<00:04:56.280> when<00:04:57.280> you're<00:04:57.430> putting<00:04:57.639> this<00:04:57.880> back<00:04:58.120> on

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
on okay when you're putting this back on

on okay when you're putting this back on
there's<00:05:01.210> a<00:05:01.270> notch<00:05:01.630> on<00:05:02.080> the<00:05:03.009> back<00:05:03.220> of<00:05:03.430> the<00:05:03.550> truck

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
there's a notch on the back of the truck

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.200 
there's a notch on the back of the truck
here<00:05:04.120> you<00:05:04.599> can<00:05:04.750> see<00:05:05.289> it<00:05:05.470> real<00:05:05.800> well<00:05:06.150> there's<00:05:07.150> a

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
little notch right there and that needs

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.680 
little notch right there and that needs
to<00:05:11.080> go<00:05:11.229> over<00:05:11.440> this<00:05:12.280> little<00:05:12.639> notch<00:05:13.210> on<00:05:13.419> the<00:05:13.539> end

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
to go over this little notch on the end

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.659 
to go over this little notch on the end
of<00:05:13.870> the<00:05:13.960> rear<00:05:14.370> assembly<00:05:17.130> so<00:05:18.130> let<00:05:18.280> me<00:05:18.370> just<00:05:18.550> get

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
of the rear assembly so let me just get

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:19.710 
of the rear assembly so let me just get
that<00:05:18.849> started

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
that started

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.430 
that started
or<00:05:20.440> actually<00:05:21.659> actually<00:05:22.659> the<00:05:22.810> way<00:05:22.930> to<00:05:22.990> do<00:05:23.169> it<00:05:23.320> is

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
or actually actually the way to do it is

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.379 
or actually actually the way to do it is
get<00:05:23.740> the<00:05:24.010> other<00:05:24.820> end<00:05:25.060> of<00:05:25.240> the<00:05:25.389> center<00:05:25.750> dip<00:05:25.960> into

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:27.389 
get the other end of the center dip into

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:30.240 
get the other end of the center dip into
the<00:05:28.389> rear<00:05:28.630> assembly<00:05:28.870> there<00:05:29.289> and<00:05:29.560> then<00:05:29.949> just

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
the rear assembly there and then just

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.240 
the rear assembly there and then just
slide<00:05:30.460> that<00:05:30.669> on<00:05:31.320> and<00:05:32.320> then<00:05:32.470> what<00:05:32.590> I<00:05:32.620> find<00:05:32.979> works

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
slide that on and then what I find works

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.990 
slide that on and then what I find works
is<00:05:33.460> if<00:05:33.580> I<00:05:33.699> just<00:05:33.820> turn<00:05:34.030> it<00:05:34.210> over<00:05:34.389> like<00:05:34.539> this<00:05:34.960> and

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
is if I just turn it over like this and

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.999 
is if I just turn it over like this and
then<00:05:37.000> move<00:05:37.599> the<00:05:37.750> truck<00:05:38.020> back<00:05:38.259> and<00:05:38.440> forth<00:05:38.710> with

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:39.009 
then move the truck back and forth with

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:42.270 
then move the truck back and forth with
the<00:05:39.280> front<00:05:39.639> wheels<00:05:39.849> on<00:05:40.180> the<00:05:40.930> table<00:05:41.349> or<00:05:41.919> ground

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
the front wheels on the table or ground

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.800 
the front wheels on the table or ground
this<00:05:42.970> way<00:05:43.210> it<00:05:43.479> spins<00:05:43.900> the<00:05:44.310> diff<00:05:45.310> and<00:05:45.599> gets<00:05:46.599> the

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
this way it spins the diff and gets the

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.320 
this way it spins the diff and gets the
shaft<00:05:47.050> lined<00:05:47.500> up<00:05:47.740> to<00:05:48.520> go<00:05:48.729> into<00:05:48.880> the<00:05:49.090> rear

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330
