00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.450
 hello friends August 5th and I'm going to 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.990
 teach a method to use less 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.300
 the chemical fungicides that we're going to 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.009
 So talk about the ecological method 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.650
 to solve the mildew problem 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.910
 in tomato plants in the tomatoes in the 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.340
 tomato plant only serves to 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.740
 tomatoes for wealth and we will 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.740
 use copper wire 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:36.250
 it is 0.8 millimeters but 80 millimeters 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.100
 and a little scissors to cut later what 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.690
 let's see how the method is like 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.580
 the method is done in the tomato 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.430
 it's just the presentation that the 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.080
 artist is 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.170
 my daughter's artist is doing this 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.670
 mural that will serve many times as 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.100
 as a background he will make several murals 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.960
 let's take advantage of the walls and is in 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.360
 the beginning around the paintings and other 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:03.370
 let's see if we can see 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:07.240
 sometimes it comes closer and we see here the 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:09.190
 numbering the copper wire a 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.740
 little bit clear but good clear between 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.290
 quotes because we are going to use it here 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.170
 of 50 meters in wall and kallio 13 euros 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.030
 it has to be copper what are we going to use 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.420
 in several tomato plants now I'm going to show 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.400
 how is the ecological method done for 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.280
 solve the method of the medium in the 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.880
 matter 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.830
 close-up we continue to August 5 and 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:37.380
 let's see how the method of 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:42.740
 ecological for 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:46.200
 Tomatoes tomatoes are not not 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.430
 incised by the mildew fungus east 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.600
 fungus that usually attacks tomato plants 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:54.649
 let's take a portion of cable from 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.649
 copper we cut it 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.650
 a portion that is going to be more or less 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.530
 a fourth 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.830
 and we 're going to nail it, let's see it here 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:10.180
 in the trunk we go in the trunk not what 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.180
 we cross in sololÃ¡ we nail 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.420
 little by little and now we're going to do 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.420
 as if it were a spring around 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.040
 dock 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.040
 if more or less almost like when alhambra 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.920
 moss no saiz 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.710
 sections and a little bit of slack we're not going 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.720
 to tighten the tree 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.290
 a little bit loose because only 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.290
 swollen 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.020
 so with 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.660
 these turns already 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.110
 with three laps more or less we loosened 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.110
 now a little 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.050
 because whenever the plant is still in 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:58.150
 increase 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.150
 and now we can cut fix how it is 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.880
 and you see we cut this part and we have left 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.960
 this pier 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:14.960
 that runs a stretch this is going to make a 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:18.440
 osmosis effect and it's going to make the 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:21.770
 sap receives properties of copper and 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.530
 make the plant immune to 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:27.500
 Tomato immune to mildew fungus and 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.709
 that we will leave during the life of 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.180
 the plant and will receive the copper what 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:36.110
 does the osmosis and we do not have to 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:38.480
 schuster simple ecological method and 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.459
 quite economical good I hope that you 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.380
 I also liked to notice that 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.820
 there are videos on this topic is not a 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.489
 theme that I invented is a subject already 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.860
 old and it is a method that is used in 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:51.140
 agricultural holdings in the 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:55.000
 farms where crops are grown 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.000
 eco friendly friends
