 new era games games for playstation 3 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.720
 playstation 4 and xbox the year in media 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.720
 digital 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:19.500
 And so people are very welcome to 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.180
 one more video on the channel 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.369
 After a long time I was feeling 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.810
 missing since making videos to happen 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.029
 some things there so I would not have recorded 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.539
 I'll explain to you now here. 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.420
 in this live commentary while 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.880
 people are playing there good good year 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.950
 Guaranteed that play mouth I'm very 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.899
 time already without playing black ops 2 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:45.180
 but it's that thing we never 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.590
 I forgot to play but let's go there. 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.510
 I was born the days 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.660
 This happened because I'm playing. 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.520
 much xbox the year now is I have one 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.770
 good option since it launched 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.360
 and since then they have never played know when 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.410
 I started to enjoy it more so 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.920
 now it 's logical not to have decent games 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.970
 when I bought the console and now I 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.830
 I'm 24, 2014, and I left it too. 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.240
 much on the wasabi xbox 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:18.000
 I was kind of tired so 300 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.909
 only doing the same thing and there 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.640
 I decided lapetox one such give a make 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:29.280
 a break so goes up pretty well basic 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:31.439
 And it was good for me too. 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.600
 I tried to record videos there. 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.189
 Of course I tried only that it did not 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.799
 way the course knows I tried to record 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.450
 a lp gibi bs-4 such put the 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.799
 highlights like I did in my last 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.579
 videos only that it was not giving much 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.680
 right 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.060
 Oh, I was not much at that. 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.320
 make videos here was that I realized that 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:53.700
 it was not much like it is in the hype and good 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.740
 I'm going I decided to go back in Black ops 2 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.320
 before yesterday if I'm not mistaken I decided 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.689
 back and unfortunately my share of 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.880
 catch left a problem for us not 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.350
 was half the catch was software that 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.780
 Use to record the videos. 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.789
 he had a problem that I did not 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.789
 I knew what it was for the whole free school. 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.959
 then she had a problem with the 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.269
 software I was recording 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.459
 with the audio released so salutary 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.599
 horrible if you do not like it or step video 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.629
 that way 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:26.790
 so I opted to take a break and 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:29.430
 try to solve the obvious problem is old 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.469
 and he was thinking as soon as he was 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.120
 recording underwater guys to be 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:35.760
 sincere so the sound was very 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.889
 strange and pierre was perceived in the face 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.239
 it can not be a problem 

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:41.879
 capture people a year board 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:46.889
 capture would be with video problem 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:50.010
 also not only a problem of sight 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:52.409
 military is an audio only problem there that 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.450
 I called and I put a testimony 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:56.280
 other older software that I recorded 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.209
 and was somewhat normal today. 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.489
 the image 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.739
 there I realized that it was software such anf 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:05.310
 laden is slow de nuevo has not updated 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:07.739
 back to normal and I'm here now 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.230
 doing an addiction but I was thinking that 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.269
 was the capture card also because it already had 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.819
 It's been a long time since I've had it since 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.109
 2010 is an internal capture card not 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.049
 It is very common for people to have 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:20.609
 internal rapist there I did not know for whom 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.540
 to resort because no one has this plaque 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:24.569
 do not write to the same software 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.549
 kill again i said old carac ro 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.989
 have to play there and even the province in 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.449
 another point the capture is not 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.459
 and then I made this gay parade that was more 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:35.010
 obvious if you do is install and uninstall 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.650
 and install new software and came back 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.449
 everything to normal 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:45.000
 some things have happened too 

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:47.099
 that's what I took so bad not bad from 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.500
 health or anything but poorly 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.389
 psychologically training has happened 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:56.819
 some things in reference to youtube 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:59.250
 even those stops that you already know and 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:04.229
 I will not say anything now because I still 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:06.209
 It is not certain, perhaps, that what happens 

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:09.090
 what has to happen will be the first 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:11.669
 I just do not want to be doing drama. 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.400
 for something that is not even happening yet 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:16.079
 I think it's not fair with you, ah I 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.250
 I hate problems, too. 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:21.810
 drama with something unnecessary and there 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.270
 I do not want to be crying here for 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.110
 do for me and you stay with pity 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.629
 of me 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.210
 but anyway if something happens the 

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:37.520
 Warning to you sure there are two faces 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:37.520
 here a face betrayed me with the deal 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:45.719
 caracas 15 May Old Pierro 

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:47.280
 My god rules but then type is usually 

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:49.710
 separate this video so to speak to 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.389
 you what was going on a sage and I 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.990
 I know that the bench with you guys face 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:57.150
 being inactive does not give satisfaction not having 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.370
 Do not say anything on twitter. 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.620
 Kind if we 're description is the I should 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:08.639
 this to you at least this 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:11.210
 and that was not what I did right there is take 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:11.210
 this responds 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:22.599
 the team face wins it there goes no 

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:22.599
 we won right? 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:28.219
 our almost that camera profile 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:29.689
 well, that's it, guys, I know 

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:31.789
 video was not as good as you 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:33.860
 I'm used to it but I wanted to make a 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:36.229
 well present live so you know only for 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.999
 explain myself very quickly and 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:41.360
 I hope you understand I hope the 

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:43.699
 feedback on the channel do not fall and I do not know 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.229
 It is very well harmed by this and 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:46.759
 That's it. It was supported by everyone. 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:50.620
 Thank you for your time for your 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:50.620
 attention until the next video went
