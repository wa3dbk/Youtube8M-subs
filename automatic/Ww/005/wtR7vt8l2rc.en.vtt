 This is that house that I did the tutorial. 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:30.500
 there I decided to make the passage 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.239
 secret so she's already made here 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.420
 In this house, I'll show you 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:38.420
 eat how it works 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.790
 but I'll give it here 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.230
 In this corner, people are where the 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.379
 secret passage 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.590
 you can not see anything and it looks like you do not have 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:50.600
 nothing in that corner but that's where 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.890
 have secret passage can see is equal 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.309
 all the songs 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:58.010
 I'll show you guys here guys or 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.789
 comes close to the one in that corner there 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:04.100
 Sometimes sometimes it only comes close. 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:06.320
 or get there on that hillside and 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:10.460
 Leap I guess, just getting close Let's go 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.560
 see getting close jadel April and I 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.720
 I'm in my hiding place where you have 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.929
 all the things I need the 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:23.119
 others do not need to be right, it 's me 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:26.149
 I do not need to know that way, the system 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:28.030
 I hid inside that of this business 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.410
 right here 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.869
 can be part of a constitution 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.729
 I did after the construction completed but the 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.979
 good to do is how much is building a 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.860
 home that you can hide better 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:44.899
 I'll show you here how it is 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:49.580
 makes this piece Trepp 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:52.069
 for example here is a wall machine 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.420
 as we were there right to do until 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:55.420
 a wall here to get better 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.909
 as if it were an appliance of a house 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:13.560
 So what are you going to do here, come on c'mon? 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:17.430
 make sure that the floor has a 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.030
 another wood here is another on the floor 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.030
 leaves the bedroom floor 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.470
 the floor will be 4 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:34.020
 here it's going to be so, people you go 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:38.970
 break this little pebble from the corner of the wall 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:42.990
 Right and another little pebble here and there 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:46.440
 under you will do the powers of 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:49.860
 You, if you want to go upstairs 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.570
 to do deep down is just to make a mine 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.240
 hidden right? 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.430
 access would be out there you can put the 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:00.240
 ladder to cushion the fall of lina 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:03.510
 so you break and if this block here 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:07.740
 and already on the wall of that corner and you 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:11.250
 breaks 12 sets 11 goes the piston and the 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:15.000
 others are remembering the option of 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:18.680
 online purchase is another block same 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.290
 from the floor here the same block from the right floor 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.990
 The inside is ready, that's it. 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.450
 this way back here 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.490
 You'll see what's right here. 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.060
 that is going to be done here you break a 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:36.120
 block and boot on a torch behind the 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.310
 piston to turn it on and off. 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.500
 that making it close and did not appear 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:47.190
 nothing here will be well hidden 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:50.010
 the next step is option is already ready 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.530
 next step is to make the driver dodo 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:59.970
 here 's what's going to be done here 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:04:02.450
 you will put in 23 blocks and climb on 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:07.020
 third under one here 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:10.500
 here you put a normal rail and here 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:13.980
 a detection rail is that track that 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.320
 You have that the trigger ache know 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.910
 It's just that he can not stay in this 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.040
 position then you will have to place 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:25.340
 one more rail here just for him to climb 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.340
 there you can break and put a block 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:31.950
 You drop a cart here . 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.740
 and a block here so that this 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:38.490
 block because when this cart goes 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:41.180
 he will see on the dvd in the detector the 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.620
 detector will send an energy signal 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.870
 and enter wherever I want 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:51.440
 This energy signal guesses where you are going. 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:51.440
 For me the torch when you fire it here. 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:05:00.240
 I'll try to make it question or be there. 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:04.700
 triggered the detector there the cart was in 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:06.900
 up detector triggered he puts out torch 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:11.100
 took the senator 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:14.280
 He lights it up and puts it on then, guys. 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:17.100
 it's ready, it's that simple 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.140
 the hiding place is ready look lonely 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:24.889
 You came near here. I'm not even going to 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:28.590
 drop it come close it fell 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:31.490
 It's very simple, much more I'm going to leave 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.490
 on the cover do not want 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:39.040
 It's very simple, this is a thing. 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.170
 very easy very cool because it stays 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.970
 very hidden not from within 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:48.330
 environment you can not notice anything 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:48.330
 look what he 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:06:00.320
 so give me another contribution there 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.880
 another video is with a network system 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.640
 sony 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:07.250
