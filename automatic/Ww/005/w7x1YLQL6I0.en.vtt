00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 at sportsfreunde I'm simon yours 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.920
 muscle maker today is about the 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.049
 liquid chalk around the magnesium 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.820
 carbonate was especially good for me 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.769
 You can always use training 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.240
 then if your grip is simple 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.190
 makes you tired and you actually still 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.529
 For example, more training could be done 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.779
 dumbbells rowing at the dumbbell 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.580
 One -arm rowing while pulling and pulling 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.140
 with many other exercises 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.939
 it just so that i usually go up when 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.350
 to loosen my hands and I have just that 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.670
 For example, a relatively small hand 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.150
 and I just notice that I have a problem 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.189
 to get 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.990
 at the fourth fifth at the latest 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.579
 the sixth repetition between 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.770
 thumb and rest of the hand a right one 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.239
 to find a handle that also holds 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.309
 and then just notice it opens 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.989
 slow my hand though a lower one 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.309
 even back my neck muscles 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.820
 train my legs even further 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.230
 could 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.579
 I have to finish the sentence because I 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.989
 simply no grip on the pole 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.430
 have and also just my hand sweat 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.940
 we go through in a neat line 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.190
 the invoice 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.660
 that's exactly what this one is for 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.219
 liquid chalk that magnesium 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.570
 carbonate I'll just show you this 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.489
 it just gives you a little one 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.719
 portion in the hands purely 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.640
 You see, my hands are now 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.199
 but already with this stuff here yes 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.910
 come in touch but I can you 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.110
 that show anyway and that 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.360
 see my hands now completely 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.070
 normal but while I'm talking about that 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.270
 sony develop you see well 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.189
 this looks like I'm the one 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.869
 Chalkboard would have rubbed his hands in 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.030
 the school somehow that looks here 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.009
 right after that dresses off and 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.090
 That's the way you can of course now 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.680
 train wonderful that is you 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.570
 gets a very good grip 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.580
 on the pole and could just now 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.049
 on train exercises and better closure 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.790
 So always look for it 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.409
 that I am also tidy in the thumb 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.479
 chalk on it so have magnesium 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.159
 Carbonate on it all that remains 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.720
 not so attached to the devices, such as 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.220
 as if this stone is used there 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.119
 even in the stone with his one 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.560
 hand over 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.360
 but something is in the gym 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.100
 Of course, always extremely reluctant seen 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.210
 and here you can see it on the bars yes 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.840
 you see it a bit but just 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.490
 barely 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.320
 and that, in my opinion, is completely 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.030
 in the context of the whole and whether that now 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.799
 the hand sweat would be the rod here 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.600
 somehow makes you happy or if that 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.680
 Magnesium carbonate from what ensures 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.880
 that too the next one with the rod 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.770
 can still train really well and 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.420
 a good grip finds that is mine 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.710
 look for a good thing so my 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.729
 Hands look exciting now 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.380
 and that's how I am going to be now 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.000
 make it cross if that's what you say 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.469
 like then you can that in any 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.880
 case below this videos order 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.469
 I would say such a pack 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.149
 right here for about a year if so 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.710
 you have to do that again and again 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.080
 you of it 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.610
 for a year as 250 milliliters and in 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.990
 a very good quality so I'm coming 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.730
 So that's good enough 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.920
 if I am there once or twice 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.900
 training at the pool training this stuff 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.730
 user everything is clearly the link to it 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.160
 under this video in the video box in it 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.160
 we look forward to your simon
