00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 and well accepted secular commenting and 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.109
 I bring you gameplay of the black ops 2 of 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.780
 fact was my first gameplay is watching 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.179
 the phrase that I am using took the 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.830
 ms mc and good as I said was first 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.540
 gameplay I said oysters this me what 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.730
 I keep to comment on it first 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.230
 game that came out pretty good is 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.760
 a hard game for teams and good 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.369
 is using it as surely mc 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.220
 with peephole and laser sight there was no 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.420
 unlocked nothing by then 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.980
 so good a game that I'm going to 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.380
 comment a bit like I'm fine all 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.579
 this of lakoff 2 and at the end of the day 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.160
 Of course I liked the game but 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.950
 I want to tell you the good things and the 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.390
 bad things that he also has 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.309
 has a bad thing that does not 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.500
 you simply want to share by the 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.079
 bad for me personally but good you 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.600
 I'm going to tell you a little bit what's been 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.340
 the game I love I love but for 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.760
 everywhere is to say the first thing that 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.379
 you have with the game is oysters or is there 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.149
 something that they have done bad for example the 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.920
 sound the sound I 've heard it and 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.539
 It makes time I listen to the first 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.760
 games I said how disgusting sound no 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.320
 it sounds like I do not know how canned it is 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.780
 Now it's weird but then you stop to 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.920
 think about it and that is that they have also done 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.630
 the sound that was made to us is weird 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.880
 it is not so well done that a 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.619
 difference with other games this us 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.509
 it seemed bad not here I mean me 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.299
 I mean that for example if you look 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.310
 they are as even quilted with when 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.899
 when there are no walls and others 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.159
 listen from another perspective if 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:29.130
 have you tried to use as for example 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.200
 the drone the dragon drone fail 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.030
 this good in the 4 bull box the rotor 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.530
 whatever you want to call it if you have 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.780
 tried to use you know using it 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.090
 the sound is totally different it sounds 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.090
 as if you were really inside 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.770
 the streak that is a sound paste is 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.780
 true that when listening to the 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.909
 steps and others do not listen too but 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.220
 well let's say that to me personally I 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.420
 has delighted then that other things you 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.369
 I'm going to tell you at the moment I was trying 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.319
 gusts you know that the combination that most 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.810
 used to carry is first the turret and 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:59.250
 then I always put the agr or do not see 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.800
 like the occasional helicopter but 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.930
 nothing, man, blÃ© is nothing 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.640
 that can control what you need 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.170
 throw on the floor because at the moment 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.900
 the long runs are coming out 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.580
 that you have noticed in this game is a 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.260
 kills kills at least is what I 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.110
 appeared for the moment of choosing 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.370
 to appear and to die to die to die to kill 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.310
 to one die then it costs a lot 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.630
 catch the gusts and how we got to 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.090
 be playing a game mode as per 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.070
 example could be they would not let me put 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.820
 now the turret has not let me put 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:33.180
 there and is saying mother at home not what 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.920
 You can shoot up but hey what 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.240
 it seems to me that it costs a lot to take out 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.400
 recessions unless you 're 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.080
 playing at the best demolition that 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.870
 implant is a pump carries 200 points and 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.360
 if you manage to exploit the 400 and 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.040
 you say good 600 points is very good or 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.050
 low confirmed that each sheet is of 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.480
 100 points has to be something that 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.550
 you find so this one is fine but 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.250
 it usually costs quite to get you out 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.170
 a very very high streak then things 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.730
 good and bad things that part of 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.490
 This on the one hand seems good to me because 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.710
 There you get a run really hard and 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.900
 it costs to take high sequences but good 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:10.019
 On the other hand, it seems to me that 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.610
 I do not know in some cases it costs 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.750
 too but hey it 's not what's hot 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.819
 that in another world you can get all 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.049
 the stripes etcetera here you see me that in 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.379
 the first prestige was super 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:21.150
 obsessed because 11 the radars the 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:23.069
 I'm going to throw all and above base 35 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.170
 points so I think to certain ideas 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.420
 radars because good indeed nobody else 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.430
 I was throwing something else, that is, I used to create 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.140
 some helicopters or anything like that 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.390
 and if they throw the cost afterwards also for 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.450
 down that way there was no problem 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.470
 as you are seeing here as I say 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.030
 they were trying lots of weapons for that 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:43.530
 I also liked implied in that of meter 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:45.359
 the type as well as the one used 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.040
 at the beginning since it takes a bit like the 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:48.389
 backup as you know all the maps and 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.060
 what I'm looking at is that they are two maps 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:53.280
 lengthened you have fixed and not 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.569
 elongated good also symmetrical and what 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.129
 that I referred to two maps are 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.900
 completely symmetrical as you have 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:59.970
 realized for example in this is 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.639
 symmetric is to say you cut it by the 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.889
 half and fold it and this one go out to another 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:07.010
 part totally equal or makes a couple 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:09.660
 already act the map of 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.459
 it seems that it is an electrical input by 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.050
 a nuclear center or something like that 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.480
 emilio maps are all practically 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.280
 symmetrical and that is obviously done 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.709
 so that from one side and another when 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.230
 reappear there is no kind of 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:24.660
 let's say that unsettled disadvantage and 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.520
 also at the level of competition then in 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.830
 the more equal you are from each side 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.450
 so much better then let's say that 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.340
 the maps have worked very hard 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.310
 as I tell myself colorful and everything 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.340
 I love this I especially do not know 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:41.639
 what gives you joy play the game we 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:43.260
 it seems absurd but first takes hockey 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.639
 I put in the whole game in fact I could not 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.440
 catch the tomahawk I just 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:48.210
 I tried and you can believe that I still do not 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.610
 has unblocked the crossbow has not even 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.440
 bought or I carry a prestige and not 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.970
 I have touched the crossbow is still something 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.610
 what good was emilio testing in 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.350
 guns and it's guns and everything and the the 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.910
 ballestera tried so very much in the game 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.280
 of instruction that in the end there was no 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.139
 tested in this mode but good though 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.430
 I have come to say is that I have tried so many 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:06.479
 I've tried a lot of weapons 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.470
 I still have many others left 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:09.720
 try that why I have not done yet 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.640
 none would have better weapons or rifle 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.080
 &amp; assault submachine guns what it is that 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.220
 it is clear that in this game the 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.950
 submachine guns are those 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.930
 they distribute and distribute a lot very much 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.510
 very much very much is exaggerated what 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.190
 you kill like a submachine gun and the truth is 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.180
 that I hope that it gets off in fact good 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:30.750
 has confirmed that they will lower it eye 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:32.340
 the gun a rpg of these then to the 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.320
 pull but they hardly hurt here thing 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:37.710
 I like that they hardly hurt the 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.360
 people the rpg if this kind of thing 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.370
 or game they got people that I do the 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.110
 mess is something out the window killed this 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.060
 who does not know the partner did this 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.230
 is my partner or he killed him and he said 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.580
 still keep looking up to see 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.890
 what the hell had happened to the people 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.620
 that was not a play that said my mother 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:55.410
 I'm already killed eight times good maybe not 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:57.890
 what the stunners the heights because or 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:00.390
 I really do not usually carry 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:02.370
 stunners or anything always in spending 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:05.520
 all in accessories because it is what most 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.810
 I care about the truth and not just have 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.650
 enough points for the 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.300
 I always get stunners 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.620
 fragmentation and others but the 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.870
 authorities just one pass like that 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.400
 the electric charges taken final 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.130
 through the window just like the charges 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.810
 electric as well as a turret 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:22.419
 analysis you have seen the turret 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.980
 the rate I do not know what exactly the 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:26.440
 system this you put it on the ground and 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.910
 does not block like grenades and other there 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.650
 a lot of things and the good thing is that there 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:32.200
 that as I say many, many, many 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.940
 things and very few points where you have 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.440
 to choose very carefully and that's what 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.330
 what am I doing trying to find the 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.850
 perfect way or combination 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.560
 perfect to be able to tell you the and let's say 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.150
 that everyone can have a streak 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.380
 pretty good but good as I say 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.240
 this first prestige has been 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.190
 basically like so summarize it 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.690
 try everything and the truth is that it gave me 

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:51.639
 pretty well I discovered that the 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:53.050
 impossible are the damn key so 

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:54.729
 great that you liked this video that 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:56.110
 you vote, I like a lot of favorite 

00:06:54.729 --> 00:06:58.600
 thanks for the support in all these 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:01.030
 videos because it's amazing so good 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.169
 here you have two more videos because we
