00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.759
 yes gentlemen sir we are still here with your 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.890
 measured in the final steps of the armed 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.320
 of the cream we were not in that with 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.780
 nuclear bad cremona we double the mass 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.790
 in half we mark the center and 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.410
 we cut lies let's say every two 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.240
 centimeters we have it ready but 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.789
 Now you have to turn around then 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.789
 we make the tips meet 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.109
 as well as now as the one what 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.630
 we do is these two winds down 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.360
 that join we are going to cross and with the 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.670
 finger we squeeze there and we cover with these 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.620
 two you're already like the water remembered we're going 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.050
 to go up here more or less here 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.149
 always always deforms a bit and what 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.829
 revelator up here, nothing happens, no 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.590
 nothing happens is reinforced in a little way 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.320
 I get him to take up there he goes pretty 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.360
 ask for these teeth and in separate 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.699
 milestone that in the oven like this has 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.410
 yeast and how is a puff pastry going to 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.440
 start to grow and they are going to start 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.440
 separate and they are going to start putting 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.440
 croquettes 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:25.290
 We believe that this is great for 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.800
 verify that you have raised another to 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.450
 when you see that it is very good that 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.370
 ask how this is cooked and I 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.410
 I asked in step 4 was to put it together 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.020
 cremona by step 5 in cooking what 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.450
 you're going to send it to an oven in between and 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.100
 strong because if you are very strong site 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.479
 to burn and you do not cook everything that 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.210
 they between medium and strong by 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.190
 approximately 20 to 25 minutes to 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.830
 start to grow it will begin to brown the 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.259
 You get warm, no, it's not going to be 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.300

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.530
 rustic nothing 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.350
 we make all the elements 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.390
 is already the ideal temperature we are going to 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.240
 put it there but I tell you always 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.860

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.830
 grow they get crocanti all the 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.690
