00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:28.699
 strategy is an aspect of chess 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:31.789
 which concerns the evaluation of positions 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:34.940
 of chess and the development of 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:38.270
 objectives and long-term plans one 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:41.000
 first of all, here we can understand 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:44.140
 what is the difference between strategy and 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.309
 we have a little bit of a tactical effort 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.379
 it's about all those moves soon 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.809
 term that lead to a goal 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.930
 rapid therefore it differs precisely in 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.699
 this from the strategy and as an example of 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.250
 tactic we saw the nailing e 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:00.890
 put on all these little maneuvering 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.030
 moves and combinations that can 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.650
 allow one of two players 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.490
 gain material advantage 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.350
 positional or from mad king 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.990
 the strategy instead regards the 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.080
 much more generic concepts as they can 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.159
 to be for example the structures of 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.890
 pedestrians 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:22.689
 or the safety of kings or even it 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.689
 development and mobility of parts 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.220
 in particular these videos 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:30.800
 will address the theme of the strategy a 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.410
 starting from four different angles 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.900
 first we will see some techniques of 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:39.290
 pedestrian technical control of pedestrians 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.390
 in particular we will see some cases of 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.060
 characteristic positions in which 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.510
 pedestrian moves can allow the 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.220
 create advantageous structures 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.500
 pedestrian and advantageous structures 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.260
 or of the creations of weakness in 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.240
 a structure to donate to the opponent 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.800
 another branch of this video series 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.660
 will be a branch concerning 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.850
 price improvement 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.729
 each piece with its characteristics ad 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.250
 example the bishop a long striker 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.160
 radius then if it will be enclosed in one 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.069
 structure of the other pieces that it 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.930
 oppresses surely will lose his very much 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.670
 strength for this there are techniques 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.800
 of improvement of the pieces that 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:24.030
 will allow you to make the most of it 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:26.100
 benefit from every single piece 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.510
 then we will see exchange techniques 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:32.880
 that is, we take our pieces of change 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.610
 for pieces of the opponent this can 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.890
 serve both to eliminate a lot 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.870
 strong of the opponent both to create 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.310
 structure weaknesses 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.269
 own opponent thanks 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.340
 to the elimination of the piece itself e 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:51.180
 finally the measures of 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.459
 that is, prophylaxis of the techniques that in 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.799
 view of a powerful attack by the enemy 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.650
 towards some area of ​​the 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.829
 our facility must be taken for 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.660
 try to stop this attack 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:06.900
 limiting damage and therefore for 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:10.459
 allow us to counterattack or 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.459
 survive the attack itself
