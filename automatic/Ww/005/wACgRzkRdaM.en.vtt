00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.600
 ladsous and compass and welcome to another 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.660
 new video and how they saw it in the 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.420
 big title fauto 5 online alerts the 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.790
 players can not play big cars 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.590
 5 ok and this was something that they 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.230
 I wanted to talk today because 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.909
 recently I heard some friends we have 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.400
 had some problems within the 

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:23.499
 big fauto 5 since when starting the 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.569
 I play practically everything is fine 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:27.970
 but when it comes to what it's going 

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:30.159
 doing multiplayer mode what 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.960
 It happens is that leave us any warning 

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:33.820
 a bit strange not if they listen to me 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.800
 little funny the voice is because I'm 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.989
 using another microphone that I think the 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.000
 that on Friday I will bring you the unboxing 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.100
 but in the same way we are going to continue 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.230
 with the video, I do not think it's something that 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.109
 It may interest a lot of people already 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.690
 that when entering multiplayer mode 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:51.789
 of big cars what jumps is a 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.679
 alert so that it does not say that it has 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:56.769
 an error occurred in the following action 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:58.570
 and this code does not come out ok recently 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.789
 I have also got into what has been the 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.699
 support or more than anything the support of 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:06.460
 great car 5 that more than anything is the 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:08.950
 rockstar games twitter account 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.470
 of support and a lot of people complain 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.510
 telling him what is happening to them 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.369
 error not here with what they see 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.409
 Here is an official statement from 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.880
 rockstar that they ask him why 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.159
 what happens this tell us I'm 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.050
 playing on playstation 4 and when he came 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.460
 what happens is that the application was 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:29.530
 close marking me the said error is in 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.720
 348 and not much else and as they see it says that 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.490
 are having many mistakes about 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.229
 this and that what will happen is that 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.300
 they are trying to fix it so 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.490
 if any of you happen this this 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.200
 mistake do not worry since it is not a 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.600
 error of your console or something like that 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.890
 but it is a fault that the game has 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.450
 So what are you doing then? 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.000
 practically the playstation console 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.530
 4 so everyone who is 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.360
 with this error or that are 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.280
 experiencing some failures is not 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.009
 worry in fact it should be noted that a 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.110
 he happened to me only once this and then he 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.270
 He took a small catch and little else 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.159
 no but this failure only happened to me one 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.440
 but once again turn off the console 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.360
 turn on and curiously I did not leave 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.789
 that does not mean that I solve the fault 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.160
 it's just a small way of 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.360
 keep you pass this judgment or may 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.670
 do not skip 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.110
 it is more than anything luck and to see with that 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.940
 it bumps the thing does not make kids 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.530
