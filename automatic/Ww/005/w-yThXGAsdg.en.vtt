make snowflakes out of paper it's a very
similar<00:00:35.780> kind<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:36.960> thing<00:00:37.100> you're<00:00:38.100> going<00:00:38.219> to

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
similar kind of thing you're going to

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.470

fold<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:40.100> keep<00:00:41.100> folding<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.700> on<00:00:41.940> itself

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
fold it and keep folding it on itself

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:53.210 
fold it and keep folding it on itself
like<00:00:48.770> this

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.010 

you<00:00:53.820> don't<00:00:53.940> want<00:00:54.060> to<00:00:54.150> fold<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.450> too<00:00:54.660> many<00:00:54.840> times

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
you don't want to fold it too many times

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.750 
you don't want to fold it too many times
because<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.710> need<00:00:56.040> to<00:00:56.070> have<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.310> little<00:00:56.520> bit<00:00:56.640> of

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
because you need to have a little bit of

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.900 
because you need to have a little bit of
a<00:00:56.880> work<00:00:57.090> surface<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:58.280> you<00:00:59.280> want<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.550> scissors

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
a work surface and you want the scissors

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.520 
a work surface and you want the scissors
to<00:01:00.090> be<00:01:00.210> able<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.480> go<00:01:00.630> through<00:01:00.930> well<00:01:02.900> so<00:01:03.900> now<00:01:04.110> I'm

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
to be able to go through well so now I'm

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.370 
to be able to go through well so now I'm
going<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.280> just<00:01:05.430> go<00:01:05.610> ahead<00:01:05.870> you<00:01:06.870> can<00:01:06.900> cut

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
going to just go ahead you can cut

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.490 
going to just go ahead you can cut
anywhere<00:01:08.070> in<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.730> solid<00:01:09.210> area<00:01:09.660> I<00:01:09.960> don't

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
anywhere in the solid area I don't

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.590 
anywhere in the solid area I don't
recommend<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:11.160> you<00:01:11.250> cut<00:01:11.520> where<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.940> laces

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
recommend that you cut where the laces

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.780 
recommend that you cut where the laces
that<00:01:13.020> will<00:01:13.230> ruin<00:01:13.440> the<00:01:13.590> effect<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.370> doily

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
that will ruin the effect of the doily

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.990 
that will ruin the effect of the doily
and<00:01:17.240> it<00:01:18.950> kind<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.010> defeats<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.340> purpose<00:01:20.550> of

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
and it kind of defeats the purpose of

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.730 
and it kind of defeats the purpose of
using<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.420> doily<00:01:21.870> so<00:01:22.230> I'm<00:01:22.320> just<00:01:22.470> going<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.650> go

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
using a doily so I'm just going to go

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.800 
using a doily so I'm just going to go
ahead<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.370> cut<00:01:23.400> out<00:01:23.760> some<00:01:24.000> random<00:01:24.450> shapes

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
ahead and cut out some random shapes

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.330 
ahead and cut out some random shapes
along<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.590> edges<00:01:27.170> just<00:01:28.170> pull<00:01:28.590> those<00:01:28.800> out<00:01:29.070> and

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
along the edges just pull those out and

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.960 
along the edges just pull those out and
I'm<00:01:29.550> going<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.760> cut<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:31.040> little<00:01:33.229> point<00:01:34.970> inverted

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
I'm going to cut a little point inverted

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.550 
I'm going to cut a little point inverted
point<00:01:36.590> here<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:39.110> kind<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.170> gets<00:01:40.410> this<00:01:40.740> effect

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
point here that kind of gets this effect

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.230 
point here that kind of gets this effect
and<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:44.550> doesn't<00:01:45.000> have<00:01:45.150> to<00:01:45.420> be<00:01:45.450> exact<00:01:46.910> you<00:01:47.910> just

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
and it doesn't have to be exact you just

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.609 
and it doesn't have to be exact you just
go<00:01:48.420> ahead<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:49.850> see<00:01:50.850> what<00:01:50.880> strikes<00:01:51.690> you<00:01:51.960> that's

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
go ahead and see what strikes you that's

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.320 
go ahead and see what strikes you that's
kind<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.190> fun<00:01:53.430> because<00:01:53.910> you<00:01:54.060> never<00:01:54.180> know

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
making the paper snowflakes so now I'm

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.950 
making the paper snowflakes so now I'm
going<00:02:04.980> to<00:02:05.100> go<00:02:05.280> here<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:05.970> I'm<00:02:06.270> going<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.510> do

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
adventurous get different effects

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.490 
adventurous get different effects
and<00:02:18.900> you<00:02:19.350> can<00:02:19.560> do<00:02:19.770> a<00:02:20.100> whole<00:02:20.250> bunch<00:02:20.670> of<00:02:20.820> them

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
and you can do a whole bunch of them

and you can do a whole bunch of them
with<00:02:22.500> different<00:02:22.770> cuts<00:02:23.160> on<00:02:23.430> everyone<00:02:24.770> to<00:02:25.770> get

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
with different cuts on everyone to get

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.490 
with different cuts on everyone to get
different<00:02:26.130> patterns<00:02:27.030> for<00:02:27.300> your<00:02:27.390> window<00:02:27.750> you

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
different patterns for your window you

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.310 
different patterns for your window you
could<00:02:28.590> do<00:02:28.740> it<00:02:28.860> in<00:02:28.950> different<00:02:29.100> shape<00:02:29.550> doilies

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
could do it in different shape doilies

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.320 
could do it in different shape doilies
different<00:02:31.320> sized<00:02:31.980> ones<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:32.820> make<00:02:33.150> a

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
different sized ones and make a

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.450 
different sized ones and make a
configuration<00:02:34.230> in<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.530> window<00:02:34.860> with<00:02:35.100> all<00:02:35.310> the

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
configuration in the window with all the

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.640 
configuration in the window with all the
different<00:02:35.790> ones<00:02:35.970> for<00:02:36.300> an<00:02:37.020> interesting<00:02:37.470> look

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650

different ones for an interesting look
so<00:02:38.520> now<00:02:38.700> is<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.150> moment<00:02:39.270> of<00:02:39.540> truth<00:02:39.600> we're

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
so now is the moment of truth we're

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.850 
so now is the moment of truth we're
going<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.290> open<00:02:40.410> this<00:02:40.590> up<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:42.590> that's<00:02:43.590> what

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860
