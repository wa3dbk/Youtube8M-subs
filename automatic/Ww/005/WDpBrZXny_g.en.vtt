about<00:00:02.700> how<00:00:02.820> to<00:00:02.909> install<00:00:03.240> circlips<00:00:03.990> and

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
about how to install circlips and

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.480 
about how to install circlips and

most<00:00:13.380> of<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.590> newer<00:00:14.150> four-stroke<00:00:15.150> engines

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
most of the newer four-stroke engines

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.080 
most of the newer four-stroke engines
require<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.080> special<00:00:16.619> tool<00:00:16.940> because<00:00:17.940> the

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
require a special tool because the

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.450 
require a special tool because the
piston<00:00:18.449> heights<00:00:18.660> are<00:00:19.260> so<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.859> Pistons<00:00:20.189> are<00:00:20.310> so

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
piston heights are so the Pistons are so

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.279 
piston heights are so the Pistons are so
short<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.210> it's<00:00:21.359> difficult<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.900> get<00:00:22.080> the

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
short and it's difficult to get the

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.980 
short and it's difficult to get the
circlip<00:00:23.160> in<00:00:23.340> them<00:00:23.460> without<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.420> tool<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:24.840> mean

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
circlip in them without that tool I mean

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.599 
circlip in them without that tool I mean
you<00:00:25.050> can<00:00:25.199> do<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.500> but<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:25.890> might<00:00:26.160> bounce<00:00:26.369> the

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
you can do it but you might bounce the

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.060 
you can do it but you might bounce the

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
piston up this video is about two-stroke

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.900 
piston up this video is about two-stroke
pistons<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.699> this<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.740> KTM<00:00:31.740> 300<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:34.910> thus

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
pistons and this is a KTM 300 and thus

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.049 
pistons and this is a KTM 300 and thus
applies<00:00:36.739> to<00:00:37.739> all<00:00:37.980> two-story<00:00:38.489> Pistons<00:00:38.879> but

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
applies to all two-story Pistons but

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.270 
applies to all two-story Pistons but
this<00:00:39.899> one<00:00:40.050> I'm<00:00:40.170> going<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.350> use<00:00:40.410> our<00:00:40.829> product

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
this one I'm going to use our product

called the easy clip the stock circlip

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.250 
called the easy clip the stock circlip
does<00:00:45.960> not<00:00:46.200> have<00:00:46.969> these<00:00:47.969> little<00:00:48.239> pieces<00:00:48.930> on<00:00:49.230> it

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
does not have these little pieces on it

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.459 
does not have these little pieces on it
and<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.559> just<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:49.950> c-shape<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:51.170> it's<00:00:52.170> very

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
and it just is a c-shape and it's very

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.260 
and it just is a c-shape and it's very

these<00:01:00.780> easy<00:01:00.989> Clips<00:01:01.320> make<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.680> much<00:01:01.829> easier<00:01:01.859> but

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
these easy Clips make it much easier but

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.889 
these easy Clips make it much easier but
there's<00:01:02.730> even<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:03.030> correct<00:01:03.270> way<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.480> install

circlips<00:01:08.010> excuse<00:01:08.340> me<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:09.180> for<00:01:10.140> this<00:01:10.260> style

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
circlips excuse me and for this style

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.859 
circlips excuse me and for this style
circlip<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.280> was<00:01:12.150> just<00:01:12.299> thinking<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.689> should

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
circlip I was just thinking I should

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.929 
circlip I was just thinking I should
take<00:01:12.990> these<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:14.100> grind<00:01:14.369> little<00:01:14.580> grooves<00:01:14.790> in

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
take these and grind little grooves in

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.179 
take these and grind little grooves in
here<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.240> hold<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.570> clip<00:01:15.780> but<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.799> can<00:01:16.950> still

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
here to hold the clip but you can still

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.270 
here to hold the clip but you can still
put<00:01:17.400> them<00:01:17.460> in<00:01:17.580> pretty<00:01:17.790> easily<00:01:17.990> be<00:01:18.990> careful<00:01:19.470> so

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
put them in pretty easily be careful so

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.850 
put them in pretty easily be careful so
I<00:01:20.369> squeezed<00:01:20.640> them<00:01:20.759> all<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.119> way<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.590> and<00:01:22.590> then

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
I squeezed them all the way in and then

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.120 
I squeezed them all the way in and then
I<00:01:23.009> stick<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.460> in<00:01:23.549> there<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.530> then<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.560> reach<00:01:25.860> in

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
I stick it in there and then I reach in

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.580 
I stick it in there and then I reach in
and<00:01:26.549> pull<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.210> out<00:01:27.270> just<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.630> little<00:01:27.869> all<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.080> take

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
and pull it out just a little all I take

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.920 
and pull it out just a little all I take
this<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:29.729> wrist<00:01:30.119> pin<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.509> push<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.780> over

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
this the wrist pin and push it over

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.109 
this the wrist pin and push it over
digital<00:01:31.920> positioning<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:32.700> heard<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:32.970> just

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
this groove I always want to hear that

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.370 
this groove I always want to hear that
little<00:01:36.840> pig<00:01:37.170> sound<00:01:38.450> so<00:01:39.450> from<00:01:39.900> there<00:01:42.380> guys

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
little pig sound so from there guys

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.960 
little pig sound so from there guys
always<00:01:43.649> want<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:43.950> know<00:01:44.040> what<00:01:44.310> position<00:01:44.850> it

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
always want to know what position it

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.550 
always want to know what position it
should<00:01:45.000> be<00:01:45.180> in<00:01:46.070> so<00:01:47.070> if<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.340> circuit<00:01:47.670> clip<00:01:47.970> was

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
should be in so if the circuit clip was

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.109 
should be in so if the circuit clip was
sitting<00:01:49.560> like<00:01:49.890> this<00:01:49.920> with<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.399> open<00:01:50.670> ends<00:01:50.850> to

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
sitting like this with the open ends to

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.399 
sitting like this with the open ends to
this<00:01:51.270> side<00:01:51.570> or<00:01:52.140> one<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:53.399> side<00:01:54.140> and<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.290> was

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
this side or one to this side and it was

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.090 
this side or one to this side and it was
C<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:55.950> if<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.130> open<00:01:56.399> ends<00:01:56.610> were<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.000> side

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
C so if the open ends were to the side

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.249 
C so if the open ends were to the side
of<00:01:59.100> each<00:01:59.369> end<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.000> stroke<00:02:00.299> so<00:02:00.630> if<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.899> piston

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
of each end of the stroke so if a piston

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.280 
of each end of the stroke so if a piston
stops<00:02:01.560> here<00:02:01.860> stops<00:02:02.250> here<00:02:02.549> stops<00:02:02.880> at<00:02:03.719> both<00:02:03.960> ends

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
stops here stops here stops at both ends

not a big deal where it might be a

the throttle stuck Tonya will the bikes

the throttle stuck Tonya will the bikes
laying<00:02:31.530> on<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:31.829> ground<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.159> you're<00:02:32.340> rolling

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
laying on the ground and you're rolling

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.420 
laying on the ground and you're rolling
down<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.940> hill<00:02:33.560> some<00:02:34.560> situation<00:02:35.069> like<00:02:35.220> that

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
down the hill some situation like that

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.369 
down the hill some situation like that
to<00:02:35.760> where<00:02:35.879> the<00:02:36.030> thing<00:02:36.209> is<00:02:36.360> over<00:02:36.629> revving<00:02:39.379> then

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
to where the thing is over revving then

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.619 
to where the thing is over revving then
that<00:02:40.950> clip<00:02:41.190> could<00:02:41.430> possibly<00:02:41.909> pop<00:02:42.209> out<00:02:42.450> of<00:02:42.569> the

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
that clip could possibly pop out of the

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.039 
that clip could possibly pop out of the
groove<00:02:42.840> and<00:02:43.230> do<00:02:44.160> some<00:02:44.370> damage<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.790> engine

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
groove and do some damage to the engine

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.839 
groove and do some damage to the engine
so<00:02:46.049> the<00:02:46.260> way<00:02:46.379> I<00:02:46.410> prefer<00:02:46.739> to<00:02:47.040> do<00:02:47.190> it<00:02:47.310> is<00:02:47.489> to<00:02:47.640> have

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
so the way I prefer to do it is to have

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.240 
so the way I prefer to do it is to have
the<00:02:48.599> open<00:02:48.900> end<00:02:49.140> of<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.379> circlip<00:02:49.769> either<00:02:50.040> to

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
the open end of the circlip either to

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.170 
the open end of the circlip either to
the<00:02:50.370> bottom<00:02:50.790> or<00:02:51.660> to<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:51.989> top<00:02:52.670> now<00:02:53.670> this<00:02:53.879> style

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
the bottom or to the top now this style

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.259 
the bottom or to the top now this style
piston<00:02:54.599> has<00:02:54.750> a<00:02:54.810> big<00:02:55.079> cutout<00:02:55.500> here<00:02:55.819> to<00:02:56.819> cuts<00:02:57.090> out

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
piston has a big cutout here to cuts out

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.270 
piston has a big cutout here to cuts out
cutouts<00:02:57.750> excuse<00:02:58.079> me<00:02:58.260> and<00:02:58.470> those<00:02:59.010> are<00:02:59.190> designed

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
cutouts excuse me and those are designed

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.000 
cutouts excuse me and those are designed
for<00:02:59.790> taking<00:02:59.970> out<00:03:00.269> pic<00:03:00.569> device<00:03:01.349> and<00:03:01.620> popping

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
for taking out pic device and popping

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.580 
for taking out pic device and popping
the<00:03:02.099> circlip<00:03:02.489> out<00:03:04.879> but<00:03:05.879> the<00:03:06.569> problem<00:03:06.989> is<00:03:07.200> is

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
the circlip out but the problem is is

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.210 
the circlip out but the problem is is
that's<00:03:07.859> less<00:03:08.159> area<00:03:08.609> to<00:03:08.730> hold<00:03:08.879> the<00:03:09.090> clip<00:03:09.299> in<00:03:10.220> so

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
that's less area to hold the clip in so

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.460 
that's less area to hold the clip in so
I<00:03:11.640> don't<00:03:12.420> like<00:03:12.540> to<00:03:12.659> have<00:03:12.720> on<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:12.930> end<00:03:13.140> stand

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
I don't like to have on the end stand

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.800 
I don't like to have on the end stand
there<00:03:13.620> where<00:03:14.220> those<00:03:14.310> cutouts<00:03:14.760> are<00:03:15.000> so<00:03:15.780> I

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
there where those cutouts are so I

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.920 
there where those cutouts are so I
rotate<00:03:16.440> it<00:03:16.470> all<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.040> way<00:03:17.280> up<00:03:17.519> and<00:03:17.849> have<00:03:18.780> the

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
rotate it all the way up and have the

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.870 
rotate it all the way up and have the
ends<00:03:19.579> have<00:03:20.579> open<00:03:20.910> end<00:03:21.090> at<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.299> top<00:03:22.730> that<00:03:23.730> way

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
ends have open end at the top that way

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.339 
ends have open end at the top that way
I've<00:03:24.000> got<00:03:24.150> a<00:03:24.180> really<00:03:24.419> good<00:03:24.599> engagement<00:03:25.230> all

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
I've got a really good engagement all

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.379 
I've got a really good engagement all
the<00:03:25.410> way<00:03:25.500> around<00:03:25.769> here<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.910> top<00:03:27.150> of<00:03:27.329> the

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
the way around here the top of the

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:28.640 
the way around here the top of the
bottom<00:03:27.690> of<00:03:27.750> the<00:03:27.810> stroke<00:03:28.049> there's<00:03:28.260> no<00:03:28.379> pressure

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
bottom of the stroke there's no pressure

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.580 
bottom of the stroke there's no pressure
on<00:03:28.769> the<00:03:28.859> clip<00:03:29.160> it's<00:03:29.400> not<00:03:29.579> going<00:03:29.760> to<00:03:30.290> flex<00:03:31.290> and

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
on the clip it's not going to flex and

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.729 
on the clip it's not going to flex and
it's<00:03:31.950> going<00:03:32.069> to<00:03:32.190> stay<00:03:32.340> in<00:03:32.459> place<00:03:33.530> that's<00:03:34.530> all

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
it's going to stay in place that's all

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.280 
it's going to stay in place that's all
there<00:03:34.950> is<00:03:34.980> to<00:03:35.190> it
