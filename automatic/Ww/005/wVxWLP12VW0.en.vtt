Oh

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.390 

trick<00:04:00.110> is<00:04:00.230> just<00:04:00.260> to<00:04:00.530> not<00:04:00.770> get<00:04:00.980> too<00:04:01.130> close<00:04:01.280> to

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
trick is just to not get too close to

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.910 
trick is just to not get too close to
the<00:04:01.640> carrier<00:04:02.060> before<00:04:02.780> they<00:04:02.930> run<00:04:03.110> because

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
the carrier before they run because

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.210 
the carrier before they run because
otherwise<00:04:04.370> you<00:04:04.850> know<00:04:05.530> gets<00:04:06.530> expensive<00:04:06.860> to

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
otherwise you know gets expensive to

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:30.700 
otherwise you know gets expensive to
replace<00:04:07.430> those<00:04:07.700> losses
