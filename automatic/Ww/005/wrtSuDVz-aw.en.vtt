00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.930
 My love sports won the start here 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.150
 Do you see my current chips training 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.559
 with the sz I'm trying with the 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.170
 even bake your biceps 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.880
 different variations respectively 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.310
 to edit different angles 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.460
 At first something more took hold 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.619
 weight less repetitions 250 cdi 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.789
 previously there was going after the hard 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.800
 back training you have so with the 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.080
 first biceps here ever very high 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.460
 burden in it and just looks what 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.900
 Of course, the last two are 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.070
 three repetitions equal cheated one 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.960
 taken a little swing 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.540
 you already have that for me here 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.180
 worked in a very high weight and in the 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.940
 The second movement continues straight away 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.170
 with half the weight only and indeed 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.300
 Now I take the elbows before the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.980
 body good that my biceps very much 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.500
 isolate the shoulders severely 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.120
 and by the very very tight grip 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.010
 get a particularly high point in the 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.930
 biceps head not especially more 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.789
 repetition than made in the first sentence 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.809
 ever repeat 15 to 20 and 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.980
 just look what's up 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.180
 point the biceps right and it full 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.379
 pops ever beautifully pure because here 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.240
 especially another angle 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.350
 have as the first set in the market 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.210
 guarantees the difference 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.920
 and that is for me as the 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.290
 Success at that time in the biceps in 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.509
 different attack variations 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.520
 position and angles to edit 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.049
 the last sentence about intervened professional 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.939
 to take the shoulders completely out 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.700
 especially to take the forearms 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.430
 tokyo radial sba reales very strong with 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.110
 in it and also very little weight we 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.920
 a lot of repetition just again 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.600
 pump out 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.310
 important for me when biceps training 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.170
 as with other vulnerabilities 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.579
 others may not always listen 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.409
 you have to get away from the others 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.579
 find the right exercises for you 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.900
 that too experience has to be easy 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.579
 train longer to see what 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.320
 you can not do that 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.060
 Do something with another maybe 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.829
 leads to success but you have to 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.720
 Just watch what works for you 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.130
 is very important in my eyes always 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.130
 stay here and continue 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.930
 It is quiet in many ways 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.049
 everyday tracy skeptics do
