00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
say a 4 by 4 or a 3 by 3 and basically

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.299

they're counting points on each side a 4
by<00:00:56.489> 4<00:00:56.520> would<00:00:57.210> be<00:00:57.239> an<00:00:57.420> Eastern<00:00:57.930> eight<00:00:58.260> point<00:00:58.590> so

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
by 4 would be an Eastern eight point so

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.680 
by 4 would be an Eastern eight point so
when<00:00:59.520> you're<00:00:59.640> judging<00:00:59.910> those<00:01:00.149> animals<00:01:00.629> and

shows<00:01:09.720> where<00:01:10.530> guys<00:01:10.740> had<00:01:11.040> used<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.430> bow<00:01:11.580> and

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
gotten really close to the mule deer and

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.420 
gotten really close to the mule deer and
they<00:01:14.729> all<00:01:15.000> take<00:01:15.750> off<00:01:15.960> their<00:01:16.200> boots<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.740> put<00:01:17.280> on

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.880 
they all take off their boots and put on
a<00:01:17.460> heavy<00:01:17.759> pair<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.150> socks<00:01:18.420> in<00:01:18.689> stock<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.710> way

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
a heavy pair of socks in stock that way

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.649 
a heavy pair of socks in stock that way
and<00:01:20.159> I<00:01:20.250> kind<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.580> thought<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.909> was<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.060> joke<00:01:21.420> and

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
and I kind of thought it was a joke and

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.570 
and I kind of thought it was a joke and
that<00:01:21.720> was<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.350> first<00:01:22.680> thing<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:22.979> Pete<00:01:23.310> told

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
that was the first thing that Pete told

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.010 
that was the first thing that Pete told
me<00:01:23.759> when<00:01:23.909> we<00:01:23.939> started<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.390> stalk<00:01:24.630> in<00:01:24.780> on<00:01:24.900> this

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
me when we started to stalk in on this

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.050 
me when we started to stalk in on this
mule<00:01:25.290> deer<00:01:25.530> was<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.250> we're<00:01:26.490> going<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.790> take

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
mule deer was that we're going to take

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.539 
mule deer was that we're going to take
our<00:01:27.360> boots<00:01:27.930> off<00:01:28.200> put<00:01:28.770> on<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.950> heavy<00:01:29.159> pair<00:01:29.460> of

our boots off put on the heavy pair of
socks<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.479> will<00:01:30.600> really<00:01:30.900> reduce<00:01:31.380> our

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
socks and it will really reduce our

with the deer position behind that Bush
we<00:02:22.730> could<00:02:22.880> use<00:02:23.060> that<00:02:23.240> Bush<00:02:23.480> as<00:02:23.660> cover<00:02:23.960> and<00:02:24.230> come

it<00:02:28.070> was<00:02:28.220> going<00:02:28.310> to<00:02:28.400> be<00:02:28.460> perfect<00:02:28.670> to<00:02:28.940> kill<00:02:29.150> that

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
it was going to be perfect to kill that

it was going to be perfect to kill that
dear<00:02:29.590> now<00:02:30.590> this<00:02:30.740> was<00:02:30.980> one<00:02:31.190> of<00:02:31.220> those<00:02:31.400> stocks

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
dear now this was one of those stocks

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.780 
dear now this was one of those stocks
that<00:02:32.000> seemed<00:02:32.330> like<00:02:32.540> it<00:02:32.750> took<00:02:32.780> four<00:02:33.500> days<00:02:34.070> we

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
that seemed like it took four days we

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.610 
that seemed like it took four days we
came<00:02:35.090> all<00:02:35.300> the<00:02:35.750> way<00:02:35.780> down<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.380> around

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
came all the way down and around

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.650 
came all the way down and around
probably<00:02:37.070> two<00:02:37.520> or<00:02:37.550> three<00:02:37.700> hundred<00:02:38.000> yards<00:02:38.480> and

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
probably two or three hundred yards and

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.930 
probably two or three hundred yards and
then<00:02:39.140> got<00:02:39.410> down<00:02:39.650> on<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.890> flat<00:02:40.220> and<00:02:40.550> there

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
then got down on the flat and there

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.730 
then got down on the flat and there

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
wasn't a lot of cover so we were just

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.740 
wasn't a lot of cover so we were just
picking<00:02:43.220> and<00:02:43.550> choosing<00:02:43.580> our<00:02:44.000> way<00:02:44.209> from<00:02:44.480> Bush

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750

with a guide like that you have to let

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.170 
with a guide like that you have to let
him<00:03:00.260> kill<00:03:00.620> you<00:03:00.770> in<00:03:00.950> on<00:03:01.220> every<00:03:01.670> movement<00:03:01.880> you

need to make the closer we got to the
deer<00:03:05.209> it<00:03:05.780> was<00:03:06.080> becoming<00:03:06.739> really<00:03:07.280> obvious<00:03:07.940> that

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
deer it was becoming really obvious that

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.140 
deer it was becoming really obvious that
that<00:03:08.390> bush<00:03:08.870> that<00:03:09.590> was<00:03:09.650> shielding<00:03:10.400> him<00:03:10.670> from<00:03:10.700> us

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
that bush that was shielding him from us

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.570 
that bush that was shielding him from us
kept<00:03:11.810> him<00:03:11.989> from<00:03:12.110> being<00:03:12.320> able<00:03:12.440> to<00:03:12.590> see<00:03:12.800> us<00:03:12.950> but

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
kept him from being able to see us but

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.090 
kept him from being able to see us but
it<00:03:13.700> made<00:03:13.910> it<00:03:14.090> extremely<00:03:14.450> hard<00:03:14.900> for<00:03:15.440> us<00:03:15.590> to<00:03:15.620> see

we kept quarter and left and right

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.530 
we kept quarter and left and right
trying<00:03:21.590> to<00:03:21.680> jockey<00:03:22.070> for<00:03:22.400> position<00:03:22.459> to<00:03:23.420> where

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
trying to jockey for position to where

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.900 
trying to jockey for position to where
we<00:03:23.690> could<00:03:23.840> find<00:03:23.900> one<00:03:24.530> little<00:03:24.709> lane<00:03:25.100> that<00:03:25.670> might

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
we could find one little lane that might

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.759 
we could find one little lane that might
give<00:03:26.150> me<00:03:26.180> an<00:03:26.390> opportunity<00:03:26.540> so<00:03:27.200> when<00:03:27.350> he<00:03:27.500> stood

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
give me an opportunity so when he stood

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:29.890 
give me an opportunity so when he stood
up<00:03:27.950> to<00:03:28.100> adjust<00:03:28.519> or<00:03:28.760> to<00:03:28.880> eat<00:03:29.030> a<00:03:29.060> little<00:03:29.299> bit<00:03:29.480> but

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
up to adjust or to eat a little bit but

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.300 
up to adjust or to eat a little bit but
I<00:03:29.989> could<00:03:30.140> slide<00:03:30.410> an<00:03:30.560> arrow<00:03:30.769> in<00:03:30.980> there<00:03:31.160> and

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
I could slide an arrow in there and

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.729 
I could slide an arrow in there and
we're<00:03:31.790> inside<00:03:31.940> of<00:03:32.360> 40<00:03:32.720> yards<00:03:33.110> this<00:03:33.260> whole<00:03:33.470> time

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.449 
we're inside of 40 yards this whole time
and<00:03:34.220> then<00:03:34.400> 30<00:03:34.760> and<00:03:35.150> then<00:03:35.420> 25<00:03:36.080> and<00:03:36.530> now<00:03:36.950> I've<00:03:37.220> got

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
and then 30 and then 25 and now I've got

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.640 
and then 30 and then 25 and now I've got
nowhere<00:03:37.790> else<00:03:37.820> to<00:03:38.000> go<00:03:38.120> I<00:03:38.480> can't<00:03:38.900> bridge<00:03:39.380> that

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
nowhere else to go I can't bridge that

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.009 
nowhere else to go I can't bridge that
gap<00:03:39.860> any<00:03:40.130> further<00:03:40.489> and<00:03:40.940> I<00:03:41.030> still<00:03:41.090> got<00:03:41.600> a<00:03:41.630> screen

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
gap any further and I still got a screen

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.320 
gap any further and I still got a screen

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.140 
to get me inside a bow range and I kept
looking<00:03:53.780> back<00:03:54.250> really<00:03:55.250> like<00:03:55.700> a<00:03:55.730> big<00:03:55.820> brother

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
like one little lane that fed right up

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.430 
like one little lane that fed right up
to<00:04:05.239> where<00:04:05.360> the<00:04:05.480> deer<00:04:05.690> was<00:04:05.720> bedded<00:04:06.200> he<00:04:06.290> was

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
into the dirt and in Pete and I decided

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.100 
into the dirt and in Pete and I decided
that<00:04:11.120> we<00:04:11.329> were<00:04:11.420> going<00:04:11.540> to<00:04:11.600> kind<00:04:11.870> of<00:04:11.930> get

together and slide up in that Lane and
then<00:04:14.930> set<00:04:15.170> up<00:04:15.200> a<00:04:15.380> shooting<00:04:15.680> position<00:04:16.070> to<00:04:16.160> where

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
then set up a shooting position to where

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.340 
then set up a shooting position to where
we<00:04:16.370> could<00:04:16.489> take<00:04:16.700> the<00:04:16.820> shot<00:04:17.090> the<00:04:17.720> bad<00:04:17.989> news<00:04:18.019> is
