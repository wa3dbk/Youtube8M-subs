I like to introduce you to a concept
that<00:00:16.299> is<00:00:16.450> often<00:00:16.600> overlooked<00:00:17.080> by<00:00:17.410> guitar

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:17.680 
that is often overlooked by guitar

players usually we play the guitar and
melodically<00:00:20.770> which<00:00:21.279> means<00:00:21.550> for<00:00:21.849> example<00:00:21.910> play

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.360 
melodically which means for example play

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.090 
melodically which means for example play
a<00:00:22.390> major<00:00:22.630> scale<00:00:25.020> you<00:00:26.020> know<00:00:26.110> one<00:00:26.320> at<00:00:26.440> a<00:00:26.470> time<00:00:26.860> or

we play harmonically which this is the

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.650 
we play harmonically which this is the
explanation<00:00:31.600> for<00:00:31.990> that<00:00:32.020> is<00:00:32.260> display<00:00:32.559> accord

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
explanation for that is display accord

we just play a lot of notes at the same
time<00:00:36.160> now<00:00:36.820> a<00:00:36.850> scale<00:00:37.629> we<00:00:37.840> all<00:00:37.960> know<00:00:38.110> where<00:00:38.260> it<00:00:38.320> is

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
time now a scale we all know where it is

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.310 
time now a scale we all know where it is
a<00:00:38.620> chord<00:00:39.100> user<00:00:39.340> is<00:00:39.550> defined<00:00:39.670> by<00:00:40.269> playing<00:00:41.019> three

suspended chords at only three notes but

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.320 
suspended chords at only three notes but
a<00:00:47.500> lot<00:00:47.710> of<00:00:47.739> them<00:00:48.010> have<00:00:48.250> four<00:00:48.610> or<00:00:48.699> five<00:00:48.850> six<00:00:49.120> even

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:49.330 
a lot of them have four or five six even

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.100 
a lot of them have four or five six even
seven<00:00:49.839> knots<00:00:50.320> and<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:52.449> we<00:00:52.690> know<00:00:52.809> what<00:00:52.960> kind<00:00:53.080> of

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
seven knots and so we know what kind of

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.570 
seven knots and so we know what kind of
car<00:00:53.290> in<00:00:53.409> between<00:00:53.620> two<00:00:53.739> extremes<00:00:53.860> of<00:00:54.339> playing

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.580 
car in between two extremes of playing

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.759 
car in between two extremes of playing
just<00:00:54.790> one<00:00:54.909> at<00:00:55.000> a<00:00:55.150> time<00:00:55.390> and<00:00:55.600> 7s<00:00:56.409> at<00:00:56.559> a<00:00:56.589> time

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:56.769 
just one at a time and 7s at a time

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:58.770 
just one at a time and 7s at a time
there<00:00:57.760> is<00:00:57.879> actually<00:00:58.000> one<00:00:58.239> way<00:00:58.479> of<00:00:58.600> playing

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
there is actually one way of playing

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.299 
there is actually one way of playing
which<00:00:59.049> is<00:00:59.320> a<00:00:59.350> kind<00:00:59.769> of<00:00:59.860> a<00:00:59.949> halfway<00:01:00.280> point

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
which is a kind of a halfway point

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:02.399 
which is a kind of a halfway point
between<00:01:00.640> these<00:01:01.089> two<00:01:01.299> and<00:01:01.570> it<00:01:02.019> kind<00:01:02.199> of<00:01:02.260> makes

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:02.409 
between these two and it kind of makes

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:05.369 
between these two and it kind of makes
it<00:01:02.530> the<00:01:02.619> best<00:01:02.650> of<00:01:03.010> both<00:01:03.190> worlds<00:01:03.640> and<00:01:04.049> not<00:01:05.049> many

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
it the best of both worlds and not many

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.140 
it the best of both worlds and not many
guitar<00:01:05.650> players<00:01:05.680> use<00:01:06.130> it<00:01:06.340> so<00:01:06.640> i<00:01:06.670> would<00:01:06.909> like<00:01:07.030> to

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
guitar players use it so i would like to

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.149 
guitar players use it so i would like to
introduce<00:01:07.299> it<00:01:07.630> to<00:01:07.659> the<00:01:07.780> concept<00:01:08.140> and<00:01:08.409> give<00:01:09.070> you

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
introduce it to the concept and give you

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:11.609 
introduce it to the concept and give you
a<00:01:09.400> few<00:01:09.760> pointers<00:01:09.840> x2<00:01:10.840> word<00:01:11.020> to<00:01:11.260> take<00:01:11.409> it<00:01:11.560> with

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
a few pointers x2 word to take it with

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.190 
a few pointers x2 word to take it with
your<00:01:11.710> practice<00:01:12.159> and<00:01:12.340> this<00:01:12.940> is<00:01:13.090> what<00:01:13.600> maybe

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
your practice and this is what maybe

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.359 
your practice and this is what maybe
classical<00:01:14.649> musicians<00:01:15.039> will<00:01:15.189> call

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
classical musicians will call

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.819 
classical musicians will call
counterpoint<00:01:15.939> and<00:01:16.409> guitar<00:01:17.409> player<00:01:17.590> sometimes

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:17.829 
counterpoint and guitar player sometimes

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:20.520 
counterpoint and guitar player sometimes
called<00:01:18.219> double<00:01:18.969> stops<00:01:19.240> the<00:01:19.930> idea<00:01:20.109> is<00:01:20.140> simple

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
called double stops the idea is simple

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.620 
called double stops the idea is simple
just<00:01:20.590> play<00:01:20.920> two<00:01:21.159> notes<00:01:21.340> at<00:01:21.549> a<00:01:21.609> time<00:01:21.789> it<00:01:22.329> doesn't

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
just play two notes at a time it doesn't

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.569 
just play two notes at a time it doesn't
quite<00:01:22.719> qualify<00:01:22.960> the<00:01:23.320> cord<00:01:23.740> but<00:01:24.280> it's<00:01:24.430> not<00:01:24.460> a

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:24.579 
quite qualify the cord but it's not a

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:27.959 
quite qualify the cord but it's not a
scale<00:01:24.880> and<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:27.100> course<00:01:27.490> how<00:01:27.609> do<00:01:27.670> you<00:01:27.789> pick

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:27.969 
scale and of course how do you pick

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:30.029 
scale and of course how do you pick
these<00:01:28.119> two<00:01:28.299> notes<00:01:28.479> is<00:01:28.750> up<00:01:28.869> to<00:01:29.020> you<00:01:29.170> what<00:01:29.950> we're

are<00:01:58.539> mine<00:01:58.689> I<00:01:58.719> the<00:01:58.840> scale<00:01:59.249> now<00:02:00.249> you<00:02:00.520> can<00:02:00.700> do<00:02:00.850> this

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:00.999 
are mine I the scale now you can do this

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:03.179 
are mine I the scale now you can do this
depending<00:02:01.600> on<00:02:01.899> your<00:02:01.990> level<00:02:02.140> this<00:02:02.859> is<00:02:02.979> kind<00:02:03.159> of

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
depending on your level this is kind of

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.370 
depending on your level this is kind of
the<00:02:03.310> point<00:02:03.759> of<00:02:03.909> these<00:02:04.060> short<00:02:04.630> videos<00:02:04.689> is<00:02:05.170> that

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
the point of these short videos is that

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.040 
the point of these short videos is that
each<00:02:05.950> one<00:02:06.280> of<00:02:06.310> you<00:02:06.520> can<00:02:06.729> take<00:02:07.179> these<00:02:07.420> ideas<00:02:07.899> as

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
each one of you can take these ideas as

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.150 
each one of you can take these ideas as
far<00:02:08.080> as<00:02:08.490> the<00:02:09.490> current<00:02:09.940> level<00:02:10.110> permits<00:02:11.110> so<00:02:11.530> if

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
far as the current level permits so if

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.770 
far as the current level permits so if
you're<00:02:12.370> advanced<00:02:12.670> then<00:02:13.060> you<00:02:13.180> do<00:02:13.450> all<00:02:13.660> your

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
you're advanced then you do all your

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:14.970 
you're advanced then you do all your
intervals<00:02:14.200> if<00:02:14.350> you<00:02:14.530> don't<00:02:14.710> know<00:02:14.830> many

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
intervals if you don't know many

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.920 
intervals if you don't know many
intervals<00:02:15.370> just<00:02:15.610> do<00:02:16.030> this<00:02:16.150> for<00:02:16.210> now<00:02:16.510> and<00:02:16.540> then

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
intervals just do this for now and then

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.170 
intervals just do this for now and then
you<00:02:17.230> know<00:02:17.770> the<00:02:18.310> idea<00:02:18.340> will<00:02:18.700> be<00:02:18.790> in<00:02:18.849> your<00:02:18.970> head

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
you know the idea will be in your head

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.990 
you know the idea will be in your head
and<00:02:19.450> once<00:02:20.110> you<00:02:20.290> learn<00:02:20.470> more<00:02:20.680> into

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
and once you learn more into

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.420 
and once you learn more into
was<00:02:21.090> you'll<00:02:21.600> be<00:02:21.720> able<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:21.930> do<00:02:22.080> it<00:02:22.220> so<00:02:23.220> today

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
was you'll be able to do it so today

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.310 
was you'll be able to do it so today
we're<00:02:23.640> just<00:02:23.850> going<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.030> look<00:02:24.120> at<00:02:24.240> thirds<00:02:24.570> so

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
we're just going to look at thirds so

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.890 
we're just going to look at thirds so
let's<00:02:25.500> say<00:02:25.620> we<00:02:25.650> take<00:02:25.890> a<00:02:25.950> C<00:02:26.250> on<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.580> fifth<00:02:26.900> for

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
let's say we take a C on the fifth for

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.820 
let's say we take a C on the fifth for
example<00:02:28.230> third<00:02:28.500> string<00:02:28.770> fifth<00:02:29.460> fret<00:02:30.620> we<00:02:31.620> want

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
example third string fifth fret we want

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.340 
example third string fifth fret we want
to<00:02:31.890> play<00:02:32.010> another<00:02:32.280> note<00:02:32.640> on<00:02:32.700> top<00:02:33.030> that<00:02:33.960> follows

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
to play another note on top that follows

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.380 
to play another note on top that follows
the<00:02:34.500> harmonization<00:02:34.950> idea<00:02:35.400> that<00:02:35.580> we<00:02:35.670> have<00:02:35.820> so

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
the harmonization idea that we have so

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.410 
the harmonization idea that we have so
see<00:02:37.340> what<00:02:38.340> is<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.520> knee<00:02:38.670> on<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.030> second

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
see what is the knee on the second

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.210 
see what is the knee on the second
string<00:02:39.570> for<00:02:39.870> example<00:02:40.230> well<00:02:40.590> on<00:02:40.770> the<00:02:40.860> 5th<00:02:41.070> fret

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
string for example well on the 5th fret

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.380 
string for example well on the 5th fret
very<00:02:42.000> easy<00:02:42.950> and<00:02:43.950> then<00:02:44.250> we<00:02:44.459> move<00:02:44.640> up<00:02:44.820> from<00:02:45.120> C<00:02:45.360> to

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
very easy and then we move up from C to

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.100 
very easy and then we move up from C to
D<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:46.020> also<00:02:46.700> country<00:02:47.700> up<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:48.120> EF<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:48.840> we<00:02:48.959> play

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
D and also country up the EF and we play

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:59.390 
D and also country up the EF and we play
an<00:02:49.170> F<00:02:57.590> alright<00:02:58.590> and<00:02:58.620> so<00:02:58.830> this<00:02:59.010> is<00:02:59.130> how<00:02:59.220> you<00:02:59.310> do

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
an F alright and so this is how you do

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:08.690 
an F alright and so this is how you do
it<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.820> when<00:03:00.090> you<00:03:00.150> play<00:03:00.300> you<00:03:00.600> can<00:03:00.810> just<00:03:07.700> and

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
it and when you play you can just and

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.560 
it and when you play you can just and
when<00:03:08.850> you<00:03:08.910> play<00:03:09.090> this<00:03:09.360> on<00:03:09.630> top<00:03:09.870> of<00:03:09.930> chords<00:03:10.470> or

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
when you play this on top of chords or

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.410 
when you play this on top of chords or
mixed<00:03:12.570> in<00:03:12.690> with<00:03:12.870> scales<00:03:13.200> and<00:03:13.730> other<00:03:14.730> ideas<00:03:15.270> in

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
mixed in with scales and other ideas in

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.060 
mixed in with scales and other ideas in
our<00:03:15.510> pages<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:16.140> stuff<00:03:16.260> like<00:03:16.380> that<00:03:16.440> it<00:03:17.040> just

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
our pages and stuff like that it just

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.650 
our pages and stuff like that it just
gives<00:03:17.370> you<00:03:17.459> a<00:03:17.489> different<00:03:17.610> approach<00:03:18.300> and

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
gives you a different approach and

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.449 
gives you a different approach and
different<00:03:19.410> sounding<00:03:19.739> can<00:03:19.920> create<00:03:20.160> really

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
different sounding can create really

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.760 
different sounding can create really
beautiful<00:03:20.850> things<00:03:21.060> with<00:03:21.270> this<00:03:21.390> and<00:03:21.770> you

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
beautiful things with this and you

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.560 
beautiful things with this and you
should<00:03:22.950> do<00:03:23.040> this<00:03:23.190> on<00:03:23.340> all<00:03:23.459> pairs<00:03:24.120> of<00:03:24.300> strange

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
should do this on all pairs of strange

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.180 
should do this on all pairs of strange
the<00:03:24.930> fingers<00:03:25.260> will<00:03:25.410> change<00:03:25.709> because<00:03:26.010> for

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
the fingers will change because for

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.830 
the fingers will change because for
example<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:26.850> third<00:03:27.030> and<00:03:27.209> second<00:03:27.480> string<00:03:27.660> are

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
example the third and second string are

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.870 
example the third and second string are
tuned<00:03:28.140> differently<00:03:28.320> than<00:03:28.769> the<00:03:28.860> rest<00:03:29.070> so<00:03:29.610> as<00:03:29.730> we

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
tuned differently than the rest so as we

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.660 
tuned differently than the rest so as we
just<00:03:30.090> for<00:03:30.269> really<00:03:30.930> quickly<00:03:31.260> let's<00:03:31.890> do<00:03:32.070> on<00:03:32.280> the

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
just for really quickly let's do on the

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.490 
just for really quickly let's do on the
on<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.120> fifth<00:03:33.420> string<00:03:33.480> and<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:33.959> fourth<00:03:34.260> would

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
on the fifth string and the fourth would

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:50.790 
on the fifth string and the fourth would
sound<00:03:34.680> like

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.650 

right<00:03:51.800> so<00:03:52.130> as<00:03:52.250> always<00:03:52.400> you<00:03:52.820> can<00:03:52.850> do<00:03:53.120> this<00:03:53.330> you

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
right so as always you can do this you

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.840 
right so as always you can do this you
have<00:03:53.990> whole<00:03:54.200> week<00:03:54.380> to<00:03:54.560> practice<00:03:54.950> you<00:03:55.490> can<00:03:55.640> do

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
have whole week to practice you can do

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.920 
have whole week to practice you can do
it<00:03:56.500> in<00:03:57.500> seconds<00:03:58.400> fourth<00:03:58.730> fifth<00:03:59.360> sixth<00:03:59.840> and

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
it in seconds fourth fifth sixth and

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.870 
it in seconds fourth fifth sixth and
seventh<00:04:00.380> if<00:04:00.710> you<00:04:01.130> know<00:04:01.280> what<00:04:01.430> these<00:04:01.520> intervals

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
seventh if you know what these intervals

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.330 
seventh if you know what these intervals
are<00:04:02.090> if<00:04:02.450> you<00:04:02.630> don't<00:04:02.840> then<00:04:03.110> just<00:04:03.260> do<00:04:03.530> C<00:04:03.740> major<00:04:03.920> do

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
are if you don't then just do C major do

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.340 
are if you don't then just do C major do
it<00:04:04.460> on<00:04:04.550> all<00:04:04.700> the<00:04:04.730> strings<00:04:05.120> and<00:04:05.330> then<00:04:05.900> try<00:04:06.080> to<00:04:06.110> do

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
it on all the strings and then try to do

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.340 
it on all the strings and then try to do
denature<00:04:06.980> and<00:04:07.160> then<00:04:07.460> e<00:04:07.670> major<00:04:07.880> and<00:04:08.270> so<00:04:08.540> on<00:04:08.660> then

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
denature and then e major and so on then

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:10.900 
denature and then e major and so on then
we'll<00:04:09.560> add<00:04:09.740> some<00:04:09.770> shorts<00:04:10.400> and<00:04:10.580> some<00:04:10.700> flight

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
we'll add some shorts and some flight

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.710 
your notes on the fretboard in case you
didn't<00:04:17.600> know<00:04:17.720> them<00:04:17.900> already<00:04:18.049> and<00:04:19.540> that's<00:04:20.540> it
