think that is just extraordinary and
very<00:01:50.369> cool<00:01:51.060> how<00:01:51.360> they<00:01:51.509> did<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:52.740> yeah

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
start to the back and the kibble is

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.320 
start to the back and the kibble is
pretty<00:05:02.850> much<00:05:03.240> all<00:05:03.510> just<00:05:04.080> preference<00:05:04.410> on<00:05:05.330> the

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
pretty much all just preference on the

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.380 
pretty much all just preference on the
instructions<00:05:07.170> and<00:05:07.650> I<00:05:08.130> believe<00:05:08.580> saying<00:05:09.060> that

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
instructions and I believe saying that

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.360 
instructions and I believe saying that
these<00:05:09.570> that<00:05:10.260> you're<00:05:10.530> supposed<00:05:10.860> to<00:05:11.010> have<00:05:11.190> it

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
these that you're supposed to have it

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
these that you're supposed to have it
like<00:05:11.760> this<00:05:12.260> kind<00:05:13.260> of<00:05:13.470> just<00:05:14.400> all<00:05:14.700> sticking<00:05:15.150> out

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
like this kind of just all sticking out

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.540 
like this kind of just all sticking out
but<00:05:16.230> it's<00:05:16.350> hard<00:05:16.560> to<00:05:16.650> see<00:05:16.920> from<00:05:17.130> the<00:05:17.310> front

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
but it's hard to see from the front

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.460 
but it's hard to see from the front
which<00:05:18.180> I<00:05:18.420> don't<00:05:18.600> like<00:05:18.810> and<00:05:19.020> I<00:05:19.050> don't<00:05:19.110> think

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
which I don't like and I don't think

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.640 
which I don't like and I don't think
most<00:05:19.860> people<00:05:20.010> like<00:05:20.640> it's<00:05:21.420> a<00:05:21.630> very<00:05:21.840> plain<00:05:22.200> very

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650

in<00:05:26.370> most<00:05:26.580> people's<00:05:26.970> preferences<00:05:27.540> just<00:05:28.260> to

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
in most people's preferences just to

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.620 
in most people's preferences just to
pick<00:05:29.130> the<00:05:29.340> whole<00:05:29.520> kibble<00:05:29.880> piece<00:05:30.060> back<00:05:30.390> out

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 
can see a very cool sculpt is a little

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.560 
can see a very cool sculpt is a little
cluttered<00:05:48.930> with<00:05:49.080> the<00:05:49.620> UM<00:05:49.860> all<00:05:50.610> this<00:05:51.150> of<00:05:51.360> the

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
cluttered with the UM all this of the

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.440 
cluttered with the UM all this of the
kibble<00:05:51.990> backpack<00:05:52.530> in<00:05:52.890> the<00:05:52.920> back<00:05:53.040> but<00:05:53.880> it<00:05:54.000> looks

kibble backpack in the back but it looks
cool<00:05:54.780> on<00:05:55.020> I<00:05:55.680> think<00:05:55.950> they<00:05:56.070> could<00:05:56.250> have<00:05:56.340> done

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:56.480 
cool on I think they could have done

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.030 
cool on I think they could have done
more<00:05:57.480> with<00:05:57.690> this<00:05:57.870> arm<00:05:58.110> I<00:05:58.380> know<00:05:58.440> it<00:05:58.710> had<00:05:58.860> to<00:05:58.890> be

00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.040 
more with this arm I know it had to be

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.460 
more with this arm I know it had to be
the<00:05:59.280> cannon<00:05:59.730> but<00:05:59.940> I<00:06:00.180> wish<00:06:00.990> they<00:06:01.020> could<00:06:01.380> have

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
the cannon but I wish they could have

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.160 
the cannon but I wish they could have
improved<00:06:01.920> this<00:06:02.130> on<00:06:02.400> a<00:06:02.700> lot<00:06:02.910> more<00:06:03.210> on<00:06:03.420> the<00:06:03.480> other

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:04.170

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 
pose I just post him in like a second

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.260 
pose I just post him in like a second
and<00:07:03.960> it's<00:07:04.169> turned<00:07:04.379> out<00:07:04.500> great<00:07:04.740> so<00:07:05.639> this<00:07:06.030> is<00:07:06.060> a

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:06.270 
and it's turned out great so this is a

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:09.529 
and it's turned out great so this is a
very<00:07:06.689> good<00:07:06.840> on<00:07:07.379> toy<00:07:07.770> I<00:07:08.069> have<00:07:08.909> the<00:07:09.090> leader<00:07:09.300> class

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:09.539 
very good on toy I have the leader class

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:11.869 
very good on toy I have the leader class
and<00:07:09.900> I<00:07:10.289> actually<00:07:10.860> think<00:07:11.159> this<00:07:11.340> might<00:07:11.639> be<00:07:11.669> just

00:07:11.869 --> 00:07:11.879 
and I actually think this might be just

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:13.670 
and I actually think this might be just
a<00:07:12.210> tad<00:07:12.330> bit<00:07:12.750> better<00:07:12.930> than<00:07:13.110> the<00:07:13.229> leader<00:07:13.409> class

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 
a tad bit better than the leader class

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:18.260 
a tad bit better than the leader class
the<00:07:14.610> leader<00:07:14.819> classism<00:07:15.270> is<00:07:15.840> a<00:07:16.879> missing<00:07:17.879> a<00:07:18.000> lot

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:18.270 
the leader classism is a missing a lot

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.869 
the leader classism is a missing a lot
of<00:07:18.419> articulation<00:07:19.229> and<00:07:19.379> I<00:07:19.979> is<00:07:20.039> very<00:07:20.129> hard<00:07:20.849> to

00:07:20.869 --> 00:07:20.879 
of articulation and I is very hard to

00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:23.089 
of articulation and I is very hard to
transform<00:07:21.150> so<00:07:22.139> because<00:07:22.650> of<00:07:22.680> that<00:07:22.830> I<00:07:22.949> think

00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:23.099 
transform so because of that I think

00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:25.610 
transform so because of that I think
this<00:07:23.580> guy<00:07:23.879> might<00:07:23.909> be<00:07:24.210> very<00:07:24.599> a<00:07:24.930> little<00:07:25.500> bit

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:25.620 
this guy might be very a little bit

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.709 
this guy might be very a little bit
better<00:07:25.800> so<00:07:26.729> making<00:07:27.029> this<00:07:27.240> guy<00:07:27.449> a<00:07:27.479> great

00:07:27.709 --> 00:07:27.719 
better so making this guy a great

00:07:27.719 --> 00:07:29.269 
better so making this guy a great
