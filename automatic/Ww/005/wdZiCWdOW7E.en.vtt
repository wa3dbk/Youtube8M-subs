00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
think he did out there I mean we didn't

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.580 
think he did out there I mean we didn't
really<00:01:48.570> have<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.780> much<00:01:48.930> possession<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:49.560> I

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
really have that much possession so I

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.859 
really have that much possession so I
think<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.250> quote<00:01:50.460> came<00:01:51.210> in<00:01:51.390> out<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.720> game

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
think I quote came in out of the game

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.600 
think I quote came in out of the game
was<00:01:52.500> frustrating<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:52.950> wanted<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.220> stay<00:01:53.399> in<00:01:53.490> the

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
was frustrating I wanted to stay in the

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.020 
was frustrating I wanted to stay in the
game<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.790> little<00:01:53.939> bit<00:01:54.030> more<00:01:54.240> give<00:01:54.450> more<00:01:54.899> touches

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
game a little bit more give more touches

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.060 
game a little bit more give more touches
but<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.119> know<00:01:57.240> just<00:01:57.420> keep<00:01:57.570> working<00:01:57.810> hard<00:01:58.070> just

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
but you know just keep working hard just

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.399 
but you know just keep working hard just
try<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.219> run<00:01:59.399> around<00:01:59.780> make<00:02:00.780> myself<00:02:00.960> known<00:02:01.229> out

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
try and run around make myself known out

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.069 
try and run around make myself known out
there<00:02:02.270> but<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.299> just<00:02:03.420> wasn't<00:02:03.810> good<00:02:04.020> enough

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
there but I just wasn't good enough

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.920 
there but I just wasn't good enough
today<00:02:04.290> we<00:02:04.590> still<00:02:04.979> lost<00:02:05.159> so<00:02:05.430> um<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.969> know<00:02:06.119> don't

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
today we still lost so um you know don't

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.660 
today we still lost so um you know don't
don't<00:02:07.380> think<00:02:07.590> I<00:02:07.619> played<00:02:07.770> was<00:02:07.979> because<00:02:08.399> we

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
don't think I played was because we

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.120 
don't think I played was because we
so<00:02:08.910> do<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.599> think<00:02:09.660> part<00:02:10.020> of<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.259> was<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.800> loss<00:02:11.009> of

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
so do you think part of it was a loss of

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.890 
so do you think part of it was a loss of
shape<00:02:11.370> in<00:02:11.550> midfield<00:02:11.700> yet<00:02:12.120> with<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.599> pleasure

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
shape in midfield yet with the pleasure

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.300 
shape in midfield yet with the pleasure
yet<00:02:13.050> available<00:02:13.319> you<00:02:13.590> have<00:02:13.709> to<00:02:13.800> play<00:02:13.950> kind<00:02:14.160> of

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
yet available you have to play kind of

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.370 
yet available you have to play kind of
for<00:02:14.489> players<00:02:14.760> who<00:02:15.000> neither<00:02:15.840> of<00:02:16.080> which<00:02:16.110> you

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
for players who neither of which you

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.600 
for players who neither of which you
used<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.620> play<00:02:16.770> in<00:02:16.830> sent<00:02:17.099> me<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.340> field<00:02:17.489> you

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
used to play in sent me to field you

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.670 
used to play in sent me to field you
think<00:02:17.790> that<00:02:17.910> affected<00:02:18.270> things<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:19.290> balance

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
think that affected things the balance

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.490 
think that affected things the balance
is<00:02:19.830> probably<00:02:20.459> not<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.660> best<00:02:21.690> but<00:02:21.989> it<00:02:22.200> should

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
is probably not the best but it should

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.559 
is probably not the best but it should
be<00:02:22.530> enough<00:02:23.010> in<00:02:23.640> a<00:02:23.670> way<00:02:23.910> because<00:02:24.209> there<00:02:24.480> are

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
be enough in a way because there are

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.199 
be enough in a way because there are
good<00:02:24.750> football<00:02:25.230> players<00:02:25.550> it<00:02:26.550> perhaps<00:02:26.940> it's

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
good football players it perhaps it's

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.140 
good football players it perhaps it's
only<00:02:27.569> in<00:02:27.660> a<00:02:27.750> way<00:02:28.520> jeremy<00:02:29.520> hall<00:02:29.700> is<00:02:29.910> not

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
only in a way jeremy hall is not

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.110 
only in a way jeremy hall is not
familiar<00:02:30.780> playing<00:02:31.080> so<00:02:31.380> until<00:02:31.650> brian<00:02:32.310> has<00:02:32.520> done

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
familiar playing so until brian has done

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.520 
familiar playing so until brian has done
it<00:02:33.300> as<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:33.600> did<00:02:33.750> today<00:02:33.870> as<00:02:34.170> more<00:02:34.380> of<00:02:34.440> an

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
it as it did today as more of an

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.130 
it as it did today as more of an
attacking<00:02:34.860> milfy<00:02:35.370> player<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:35.930> Agudelo<00:02:36.930> is

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
attacking milfy player and Agudelo is

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.170 
attacking milfy player and Agudelo is
normally<00:02:37.620> play<00:02:38.069> a<00:02:38.099> lot<00:02:38.370> of<00:02:38.489> games<00:02:38.670> as<00:02:38.910> wanted

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
normally play a lot of games as wanted

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.240 
normally play a lot of games as wanted
left<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.690> irving<00:02:40.019> in<00:02:40.140> c<00:02:40.319> right<00:02:40.530> position<00:02:41.100> so

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
left and irving in c right position so

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.000 
left and irving in c right position so
probably<00:02:41.610> only<00:02:41.959> jeremy<00:02:42.959> so<00:02:43.260> it<00:02:43.440> should<00:02:43.739> in<00:02:43.980> a

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
probably only jeremy so it should in a

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.120 
probably only jeremy so it should in a
way<00:02:44.190> it's<00:02:44.400> not<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.930> most<00:02:45.930> physical<00:02:46.620> midfield

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
way it's not the most physical midfield

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.580 
way it's not the most physical midfield
but<00:02:47.370> they<00:02:47.580> should<00:02:47.940> be<00:02:48.269> rather<00:02:49.080> good<00:02:49.380> on<00:02:49.500> the

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
but they should be rather good on the

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.770 
but they should be rather good on the
ball<00:02:49.709> if<00:02:50.700> you<00:02:50.850> personally<00:02:51.330> how<00:02:51.390> did<00:02:51.540> you<00:02:51.630> feel
