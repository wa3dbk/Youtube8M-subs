00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:07.430
 for better it's always nice that 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:10.549
 large teams of this name ask you 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.440
 I was lucky to be able to 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:14.660
 They have also asked that if there could be 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.570
 given a contribution improvements improvement and good 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.720
 today we are here and with much expectation 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:23.630
 to take the match tomorrow if we know what 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.580
 what is student is a big team is 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.279
 a team that is South America know him 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.580
 we all know that it has a very potential 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.260
 big the air game individually 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.400
 has players who are very balanced 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.110
 all right 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.050
 but well we think we're 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.900
 we are very good we come with a lot 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.930
 enthusiasm with much desire we come from 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.000
 lose the Ecuadorian championship and good 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.650
 the truth that soccer has the beautiful 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.970
 that I give you the rematch quickly and 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.320
 good in the rematch tomorrow against 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.470
 when students is where I feel 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.050
 more comfortable is by means obviously 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.880
 Good thing the technician asks you to do 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.770
 the sacrifice of being able to help the lateral 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.940
 in the time to defend but good to the 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.280
 time to attack that what what I 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.770
 like it gives me the freedom to be able to throw myself 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.260
 both in the middle and on the right as well 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.390
 That's good, because that's where 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.740
 I feel comfortable and where I could mark 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.290
 several goals last semester with 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.729
 national are now a temptation in the 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.010
 close of the talk are a temptation 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.920
 white and Jesus to throw the 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.460
 ball or not or that is preferable to play 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.460
 under 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:33.360
 good the truth that white has 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.230
 very good movements because it moves 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.180
 very well you mark where you want the pass 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.460
 It is always well located so good 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.380
 it's made for a player like for me 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.390
 it makes it much easier to play with him 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.670
 because because he looks for what 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.490
 space and you mark where you want the 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.600
 ball in as much of jesus is a player 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.720
 that is fast is powerful strong knows that 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.120
 If you put them on the foot, you can 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.570
 spin with the strength that has and stay 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.570
 in each goal
