 Generally on fragrant crab eyes 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.540
 chopsticks 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.140
 for this we need accordingly 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.640

 butter for frying 150 grams of cheese if 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:33.149
 we have crab sticks frozen here 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.899
 this is to make it easier to wipe 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.450
 them through the wash but if not frozen 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.430
 nothing terrible can grind them 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.969
 blender can be cut into cubes there 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.370
 stripes but somehow conveniently we them 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:53.789
 we sell six 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:58.230
 on a large grater rub after that 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:01.940

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:11.299
 now cut the greens 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.189
 you can add garlic instead of green 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.390
 it will be also the taste of garlic 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.680
 with greens 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.680
 should be tasty 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:31.380
 immediately you can add 2 eggs here and the third 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:41.700
 we will see how it should work 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:46.800
 the patty must guard the forms all this 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:50.030
 let's mix it seems 2 have enough for us 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:55.110
 we will not add 3 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:58.530

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.800
 breadcrumbs 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.700
 but if there is no breadcrumbs 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.660
 use flour 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.660

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.989
