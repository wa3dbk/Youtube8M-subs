I<00:00:27.990> don't<00:00:28.320> think<00:00:28.380> Manchester<00:00:28.830> United

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
I don't think Manchester United

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.650 
I don't think Manchester United
themselves<00:00:29.699> would<00:00:29.820> argue<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.449> team

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
themselves would argue that the team

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.389 
themselves would argue that the team
that's<00:00:30.900> played<00:00:31.140> best<00:00:31.470> on<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.800> day<00:00:31.830> won<00:00:32.250> the

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.850 
that's played best on the day won the
Cup<00:00:32.579> I<00:00:32.880> thought<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:33.660> hard<00:00:33.899> time<00:00:34.200> we<00:00:34.410> played

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.299 
over so well
disappointed<00:00:36.329> we<00:00:36.420> didn't<00:00:36.600> have<00:00:36.690> another<00:00:36.899> goal

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309

the Manchester United dressing room at

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.020 
the Manchester United dressing room at
the<00:01:07.610> moment<00:01:07.790> I<00:01:08.120> think<00:01:09.370> it's<00:01:10.370> very<00:01:10.520> sad<00:01:10.790> day<00:01:11.000> for

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
the moment I think it's very sad day for

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.390 
the moment I think it's very sad day for
the<00:01:11.330> note<00:01:11.590> sometimes<00:01:12.590> you<00:01:12.860> don't<00:01:12.979> get<00:01:13.190> to<00:01:13.250> be

the note sometimes you don't get to be

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.070 
the note sometimes you don't get to be
deserving<00:01:13.910> people<00:01:14.030> that<00:01:14.479> I<00:01:14.600> thought<00:01:14.840> were<00:01:14.900> did

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
deserving people that I thought were did

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.230 
deserving people that I thought were did
they're<00:01:15.229> better<00:01:15.470> today<00:01:15.850> probably<00:01:16.850> greater

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
they're better today probably greater

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.910

disappointment<00:01:17.720> for<00:01:18.050> you<00:01:18.200> is<00:01:18.320> it<00:01:18.440> the<00:01:18.740> team

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
disappointment for you is it the team

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.400

didn't<00:01:19.159> play<00:01:19.310> terribly<00:01:19.700> well

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
didn't play terribly well

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.820 
didn't play terribly well
well<00:01:21.410> I<00:01:21.470> don't<00:01:21.680> think<00:01:21.740> that<00:01:23.530> probably<00:01:24.530> with

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
well I don't think that probably with

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.410 
well I don't think that probably with
like<00:01:25.100> a<00:01:25.130> real<00:01:25.369> cotton<00:01:25.610> age<00:01:25.790> in<00:01:25.910> the<00:01:25.970> first<00:01:26.180> half

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
like a real cotton age in the first half

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.840 
like a real cotton age in the first half
I<00:01:26.780> thought<00:01:27.740> we<00:01:27.890> don't<00:01:27.950> even<00:01:28.310> want<00:01:28.460> to<00:01:28.550> play<00:01:28.759> in

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
I thought we don't even want to play in

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:29.620 
I thought we don't even want to play in
the<00:01:28.940> second<00:01:29.270> half

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
the second half
