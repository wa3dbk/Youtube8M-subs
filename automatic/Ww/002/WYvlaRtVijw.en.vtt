00:00:06.749 --> 00:00:11.049
 hello friends and welcome to this 

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:13.870
 new mobile video video there had 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:15.570
 for a long time we had not made a blog 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:20.410
 the best cyclosportive of your life 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.689
 here nicolas diard your coach who is 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.310
 well will join the friends to go 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.259
 to ride at the beginning of the year 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.820
 we need to motivate ourselves and to 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.089
 join the friends and well that's 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.820
 often a good source of motivation 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:34.239
 how to train in this early 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.129
 year 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.750
 well, the elders told you 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:39.879
 many said to me but I'm rolling 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.260
 in a club and all that and then 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.350
 are the old ones they say to roll 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.719
 to make 1000km terminals to ride 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.579
 for two months where and it's with the 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:51.489
 small tray to roll easy to roll 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:54.750
 and that's what it's called 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:57.010
 land training and before that was 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.289
 the essence of the chord training 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.640
 before training while training 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:01.899
 and we did some training 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.210
 that is to say, to roll the longest 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.400
 possible at very low intensity 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.350
 preference in motion and all that 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.580
 is the speed the force the technique good 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.640
 there work and work doing 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.070
 competitions so we gave you 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:19.260
 a reference of accor leave cus 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.810
 professionals from the 80s - 90s roll 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.970
 35000 40000 some 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.560
 roll even a little more agree 40000 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.329
 km in the year and rockets sometimes 60 70 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.950
 races a year some made 100 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.570
 races a year, that is two races 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.250
 per week of course there were some 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.799
 course over several days but it's a 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.899
 average ok that was running in general 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.850
 from the month of February until 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.840
 october 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.979
 because if they wanted to, that's it 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.170
 short and that's what made the 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.450
 quality and between races and before 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.770
 the races have recovered with 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.310
 land training and we were getting 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.890
 the cashier 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.209
 here is very well simple workout but 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.740
 you have to work for hours 

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:57.330
 today professional cyclists 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.310
 even the best rolls 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.409
 twenty five or thirty thousand kilometers 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.509
 only in the year is 10000 km of 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.030
 the less it is considerable it is 25% 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.209
 hockey and in terms of race 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.920
 few are more than 40 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.290
 days of races in the year 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.989
 okay which a lot in race by 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.130
 against in the workouts 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.660
 the trainings are much more 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.090
 qualitative have done much more than 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.500
 quality in terms of intensity we are going 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.829
 vary the intensity of the workouts 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.049
 with two intense technique etc 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:30.390
 so me that's what I advise you 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.400
 to do on this first month of recovery 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.470
 for most of you 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.239
 when you go back to this important 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.209
 to resume happiness once again 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.489
 it will save you from having to take back very 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.480
 strong to the arrivals in the spring to the beautiful 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.430
 days it's nice but here we go 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.510
 take back a lot and the body did 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.420
 no time to adapt 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.140
 so ride little but ride well all of 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.540
 following a deal 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.129
 so that means what does it mean 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.799
 do not hesitate to go out 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:57.359
 short but with intensity 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.250
 intensity means what does it want 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:01.590
 say we're going to roll fast we'll do 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.140
 mount the heart rather on fractions 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.329
 okay make it 30 seconds a minute 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.530
 we will try to chain and his friends 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:09.269
 split for the most 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.750
 sharp interview do not hesitate 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:15.569
 okay makes outings like a cool 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:19.590
 where you will work the technique the 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:21.510
 velocity the force the one-legged the 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.280
 pedaling that on one side the dancer 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.359
 okay and there you do cool for 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.870
 recover you regenerate 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:30.120
 but even if it's small outlets 7 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.129
 small outings but be 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.569
 techniques including qualitative one point of 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:35.939
 technical view and at the heart level 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:39.599
 you stay between 70 and 85 central 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:41.790
 cemac is qualitative from a point of view 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:44.280
 intensity ie you work 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.900
 the different intensity channels 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.750
 what is it of course it is endurance 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.870
 between 70 and 80% heart rate 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.610
 maximum is 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.129
 what we will call the threshold of agreement 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.750
 efforts 2 3 to 5 minutes 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:58.220
 possibly ten minutes 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.700
 and there you will be around 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:04.450
 90 95 % of those matches his close to the 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.860
 glow of race we'll say and then d 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.170
 maximum intensity or frequency 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.540
 maximum heart are you the workshop 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.909
 sown on 30 seconds efforts 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.379
 only after you go reputed and 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:18.229
 then last sector to remember 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:20.419
 these are the sprints the agreement makes 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:22.760
 small sprints regularly less than 10 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:25.280
 seconds but maximum intensity or in 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.380
 truthfulness or even to have fun the 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.800
 playful but work all these 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:34.370
 intensities the a16 ben as before 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.020
 was working for the 1000km then two 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.979
 or three months the land to do this 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.930
 checkout but then we realized 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:40.760
 that you make your crate a lot 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.990
 the better you do not transform yourself 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.320
 she always rolling to the same 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.610
 look 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.590
 but instead you have developed 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.780
 the whole palette of the cyclist and you 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.360
 will be ready to attack the training 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:53.030
 we will say specific to or very 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.650
 Competitive just before the competitions 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.510
 that you are going to attack either at 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.860
 spring be those who attack this 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.169
 summer you will have a little more time to 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.940
 prepare yourself 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:03.560
