00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
this way you're losing I'll most of the

this way you're losing I'll most of the

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
medicinal properties from it because

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.580 
medicinal properties from it because
bond<00:04:01.519> that<00:04:01.730> kills<00:04:01.969> it<00:04:02.120> but<00:04:02.329> but<00:04:03.230> you<00:04:03.319> do<00:04:03.439> get<00:04:03.530> a

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
bond that kills it but but you do get a

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:04.870 
bond that kills it but but you do get a
better<00:04:03.739> flavor

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
better flavor

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.430 
better flavor
for<00:04:05.150> medicinal<00:04:05.330> purposes<00:04:05.930> you<00:04:06.050> want<00:04:06.140> to<00:04:06.290> see

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
something like that and so I'll probably

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.640 
something like that and so I'll probably
give<00:04:10.970> that<00:04:11.150> a<00:04:11.180> try<00:04:11.390> too<00:04:11.720> but<00:04:11.990> for<00:04:12.350> now<00:04:12.470> I<00:04:12.500> just

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
right now but I guess I'll get an idea

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.100 
right now but I guess I'll get an idea
what<00:04:58.830> it<00:04:58.920> tastes<00:04:59.250> like<00:04:59.280> and<00:04:59.630> and<00:05:00.630> I<00:05:00.750> read<00:05:00.960> up

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
what it tastes like and and I read up

that and heard that people like mix it

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.380 
that and heard that people like mix it
with<00:05:03.060> honey<00:05:03.330> or<00:05:03.660> even<00:05:03.990> a<00:05:04.020> little<00:05:04.140> bit<00:05:05.390> alright

with honey or even a little bit alright

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:16.820 
with honey or even a little bit alright
so<00:05:06.600> it<00:05:07.290> is<00:05:07.320> let's<00:05:07.620> give<00:05:07.740> it<00:05:07.770> a<00:05:07.860> try<00:05:08.010> now<00:05:15.830> that's

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
so it is let's give it a try now that's
