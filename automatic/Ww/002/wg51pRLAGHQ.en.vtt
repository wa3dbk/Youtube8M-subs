00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
guess there are a few more I think I

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.039 
guess there are a few more I think I
have<00:02:47.250> about<00:02:47.430> 50<00:02:47.849> or<00:02:48.000> 40<00:02:48.209> games<00:02:48.510> on<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.750> Xbox

360<00:02:49.200> but<00:02:50.099> don't<00:02:50.280> really<00:02:50.430> know<00:02:50.640> all<00:02:50.670> of<00:02:51.000> them

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
360 but don't really know all of them

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:52.910 
360 but don't really know all of them
anyway<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:51.959> next<00:02:52.049> question<00:02:52.440> comes<00:02:52.620> from<00:02:52.769> the

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:58.970 
think about the new uprising DLC I think
it's<00:02:57.780> going<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:57.989> be<00:02:58.079> great<00:02:58.319> I<00:02:58.349> really<00:02:58.680> like<00:02:58.829> the

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
over that matter because I really liked

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.360 
over that matter because I really liked
high<00:03:03.269> rise<00:03:03.540> from<00:03:03.840> modern<00:03:04.079> warfare<00:03:04.230> 2<00:03:04.440> but<00:03:05.220> we

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
high rise from modern warfare 2 but we

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.400 
high rise from modern warfare 2 but we
really<00:03:05.610> just<00:03:05.730> have<00:03:05.970> to<00:03:06.120> wait<00:03:06.299> and<00:03:06.510> see<00:03:06.750> and<00:03:07.170> we

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
really just have to wait and see and we

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.770 
really just have to wait and see and we
also<00:03:07.590> have<00:03:07.950> mob<00:03:08.310> of<00:03:08.459> the<00:03:08.489> dead<00:03:08.700> everyone<00:03:09.540> seems

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
to be incredibly fun to me I think it's

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.849 
to be incredibly fun to me I think it's
going<00:03:12.209> to<00:03:12.299> be<00:03:12.389> kind<00:03:12.720> of<00:03:12.780> like<00:03:12.900> keno<00:03:13.260> detto<00:03:13.620> and

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859
