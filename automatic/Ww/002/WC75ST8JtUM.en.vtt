00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:11.389
 Now , let me show you the movie of the boss and the course of the morning course. 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:14.469
 Select configurations as in the last warrior to expel the cloud so Erica Lee Seung Yeon 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:14.469
 I'll do it. 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:22.970
 Again, like in Sligo ultra-hyped and somewhat sulman charged from the source 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:22.970
 It will not be 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:37.850
 If you like Amok course has not changed incher pattern emerged in the first 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.850
 If you know the patterns well, you keep listening to the security 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.390
 I think you can take a look at the training with Cloud . 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:58.170
 There may be people who have not been able to do any courses since then. 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:58.170
 In the case of the same pattern, I'll try to explain in the middle. 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:04.200
 When a roar like that is just like a normal take if the center have lots 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.470
 There are technologies called left and right like this 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:22.010
 Oh, there's that naolttaedo left to suffer continuous then the Po 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:27.160
 There is a case where the center comes out after the deduction and comes out on the right side 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.160
 Oh , I'll explain that later. 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:42.560
 Oh, I changed it to 7 adults. 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:44.610
 Usually when a little bite, I get about in the past is defined by the nose Choir books 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:50.990
 It's fast. 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:54.429
 Even though the score is a little higher now 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.429
 Not yet. 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.520
 I 've already shot twice as much in the cloud. 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.080
 222 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:14.220
 It's getting faster now. 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.610
 Look at the bottom of the floor and I'm starting to see it's wide open. 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.610
 Because of 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.180
 From now on, you have to be a little concerned with the controls. 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.180
 woo 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.020
 U 222 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.020
 U 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.569
 This is esl, but after the dds are laid out twice, 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.709
 From now on 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:45.010
 Keepers are coming up repeatedly, we see that pattern repeated Since then, 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.010
 It's 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.120
 U 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:00.360
 Oo 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:04.010
 Now, from now on, it's a repeating pattern. 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.010
 After the card phone came out like that 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:13.890
 Character 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:18.750
 This is coming from consecutive correct, but it depends 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:21.200
 When you do this, a short piece still so late as it is now the middle attacks 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.200
 It's coming out. 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:32.560
 I do not think I 'll be there yet. 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.560
 Because it should always be the first Central attacks 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:39.200
 It's okay if you block that thing. 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:51.170
 we 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:52.970
 It is to be careful after a wide one just left earlier attacked continuous talk 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:58.069
 Suddenly 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:04:02.230
 There comes up a central attacking Also please Siem song 5 million copies Stern 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.230
 You can continue to score in the baggage 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:10.570
 As with the brain, there are left and right 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:15.160
 In the section where I made it alone and it is still like this 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:18.970
 It also comes in the right and left, but here comes the middle. 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:23.610
 It needs only to look just fine indeyo points harm us is 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.610
 There can be an infinite score 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:33.210
 After I have just owned it, I have a central TV. 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:42.840
 In fact, since the watchman came out for the second time, 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:50.240
 You can look at the concentration fight . 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:50.240
 If there is no boss , it will be a concentration fight unless it is a patch. 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:07.650
 If you keep going on this 40 minutes , I'm asking you the same. 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.650
 And then the central public 0 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.340
 other 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:25.330
 Example 2 One pattern repeating pattern Meaning 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:27.969
 In the case of a skill attack, it may be a little random 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:31.259
 Just a little revised yes 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:31.259
 I can see that I see the situation . 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:43.069
 I've been getting over 100,000 points, and I've got a little more concentration . 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:43.069
 wow 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:51.740
 To turn off like a super nice to take a look around the moon 100,000 years 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.740
 That's enough. 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.550
 U 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.300
 I'm getting a lot of mistakes from me. 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.050
 3 minutes'm not gonna I almost died 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.740
 we 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:27.319
 db1 has become a full scale 4 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:30.319
 I think it 's over. 

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:30.319
 222 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:38.440
 The same holds true, but the concentration is drawn by practice 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.440
 Because I can make mistakes 

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.700
 U 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:47.330
 be a 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:47.330
 It looks like it's over . 

00:06:48.459 --> 00:06:57.279
 It is probably the first time this is the dark course and Tanabata 

00:06:52.989 --> 00:07:00.699
 Because together gatgido this section will be able to go up floating somehow takes longer 

00:06:57.279 --> 00:07:04.289
 This degree will Likes kkeutin 

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:04.289
 I will do this video so far.
