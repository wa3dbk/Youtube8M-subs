00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
right now but it was a vector-based tank

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.250 
right now but it was a vector-based tank
game<00:00:22.830> so<00:00:23.460> vector<00:00:23.730> tanks<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:24.420> available<00:00:25.080> today

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
game so vector tanks is available today

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.920 
game so vector tanks is available today

and 99 cents and there's the icon looks
like<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.910> vectorized<00:00:32.910> tanked<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.190> when<00:00:35.190> I

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
like a vectorized tanked and when I

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.590 
like a vectorized tanked and when I
launch<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:35.850> think<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.180> guys<00:00:36.329> will<00:00:36.540> be

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
launch it I think you guys will be

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.490 
launch it I think you guys will be
familiar<00:00:37.170> with<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.920> interface<00:00:39.320> see<00:00:40.320> that

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
familiar with the interface see that

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.540 
familiar with the interface see that
looks<00:00:41.100> like<00:00:41.190> an<00:00:41.340> old<00:00:41.550> arcade<00:00:41.960> Atari<00:00:43.070> type<00:00:44.070> deal

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
looks like an old arcade Atari type deal

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.260 
looks like an old arcade Atari type deal
but<00:00:45.559> very<00:00:46.559> very<00:00:46.800> nice<00:00:47.010> game<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.670> love<00:00:48.120> these

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
but very very nice game I love these

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.700 
but very very nice game I love these
types<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.719> games<00:00:48.780> i'm<00:00:49.170> gonna<00:00:49.289> show<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.440> why<00:00:49.620> in

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
types of games i'm gonna show you why in

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.939 
types of games i'm gonna show you why in
a<00:00:49.770> second<00:00:50.129> now<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:51.059> does<00:00:51.510> support<00:00:51.870> some<00:00:52.739> cool

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
a second now it does support some cool

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.170 
a second now it does support some cool
features<00:00:53.160> there's<00:00:53.550> 3d<00:00:53.940> tanks<00:00:54.390> jeeps<00:00:54.949> minds

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
features there's 3d tanks jeeps minds

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.599 
features there's 3d tanks jeeps minds
there's<00:00:57.180> things<00:00:57.510> like<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.780> flying<00:00:58.680> shrapnel<00:00:59.100> so

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
there's things like a flying shrapnel so

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.029 
there's things like a flying shrapnel so
when<00:00:59.730> you<00:00:59.820> blow<00:01:00.059> up<00:01:00.090> things<00:01:00.500> it<00:01:01.500> actually<00:01:01.710> can

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
when you blow up things it actually can

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.000 
when you blow up things it actually can
kill<00:01:02.399> other<00:01:03.030> tanks<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.750> there's<00:01:04.500> physics

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
kill other tanks and there's physics

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.130 
kill other tanks and there's physics
involved<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:05.790> there's<00:01:05.970> particle<00:01:06.450> systems<00:01:06.869> and

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
involved so there's particle systems and

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.410 
involved so there's particle systems and
and<00:01:07.439> things<00:01:08.250> like<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.490> but<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.180> thing<00:01:09.330> I

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
and things like that but the thing I

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.740 
and things like that but the thing I
like<00:01:09.600> about<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.970> the<00:01:11.970> control<00:01:12.360> system

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
like about it is that the control system

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.000 
like about it is that the control system
you<00:01:12.840> see<00:01:12.990> these<00:01:13.110> two<00:01:13.290> things<00:01:13.560> on<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.830> side

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
you see these two things on the side

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.920 
you see these two things on the side
they<00:01:14.430> kind<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.700> control<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.090> tank<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.750> can

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
they kind of control the tank so I can

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.320 
they kind of control the tank so I can
go<00:01:16.020> up<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.380> down<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:17.460> move<00:01:17.700> back<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.060> forth

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
go up and down and move back and forth

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.270 
go up and down and move back and forth
and<00:01:18.509> then<00:01:18.659> tap<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.350> middle<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.830> screen<00:01:20.040> to

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
and then tap the middle of the screen to

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.039 
and then tap the middle of the screen to
shoot<00:01:20.960> you<00:01:21.960> made<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:22.920> just<00:01:23.130> died<00:01:23.960> but<00:01:24.960> I'm

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
kind of having a look around the corner

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.330 
kind of having a look around the corner
that's<00:01:26.759> my<00:01:26.970> excuse<00:01:27.330> I'm<00:01:27.630> sticking<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.340> and

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
that's my excuse I'm sticking to it and

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.569 
that's my excuse I'm sticking to it and
I<00:01:29.490> kill<00:01:29.729> this<00:01:29.880> guy<00:01:30.119> but<00:01:30.570> nope<00:01:31.110> nope<00:01:31.380> come<00:01:31.590> on<00:01:31.710> hi

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
kind of funny I used to be good at this

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.219 
kind of funny I used to be good at this
game<00:01:39.030> there<00:01:39.299> was<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.450> time<00:01:39.689> when<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.900> was<00:01:40.049> pretty

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
you guys can see as you can see I move

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.389 
you guys can see as you can see I move
it<00:01:48.119> down<00:01:48.420> on<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.290> left<00:01:49.470> side<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.950> turn<00:01:50.130> left

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
it down on the left side to turn left

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.460 
it down on the left side to turn left
and<00:01:50.640> up<00:01:51.149> on<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.360> right<00:01:51.570> side<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:52.020> turn<00:01:52.170> right

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
and up on the right side the turn right

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.530 
and up on the right side the turn right
and<00:01:52.740> up<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.189> down<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.970> go<00:01:54.060> forward<00:01:54.420> and

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
and up and down to go forward and

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.789 
and up and down to go forward and
backwards<00:01:54.899> so<00:01:55.020> it's<00:01:55.140> kind<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.350> like<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.530> real

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
backwards so it's kind of like a real
