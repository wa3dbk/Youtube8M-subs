my<00:00:15.750> career<00:00:15.809> of<00:00:16.260> course<00:00:16.529> I'm<00:00:16.770> aware<00:00:17.220> of<00:00:17.340> that

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
my career of course I'm aware of that

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
and yeah and obviously the crowd was

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.929

loss<00:00:24.210> but<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.840> still<00:00:25.650> thought<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:25.920> was<00:00:26.189> an

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
loss but I still thought it was an

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.250 
loss but I still thought it was an
amazing<00:00:26.849> atmosphere<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.510> an<00:00:27.779> amazing<00:00:28.109> match

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
amazing atmosphere and an amazing match

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.169 
amazing atmosphere and an amazing match
to<00:00:28.410> be<00:00:28.500> part<00:00:28.710> of<00:00:28.800> was<00:00:29.220> it's<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.789> ridiculous

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
to be part of was it's a ridiculous

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.339 
to be part of was it's a ridiculous
question<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.570> ask<00:00:30.660> because<00:00:30.900> it's<00:00:31.109> bit<00:00:31.230> like

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
question to ask because it's bit like

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.959 
question to ask because it's bit like
anybody<00:00:31.650> asks<00:00:31.949> when<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.130> when<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:32.579> compare

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
anybody asks when you when you compare

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.830 
anybody asks when you when you compare
anything<00:00:33.420> but<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.170> seven<00:00:34.739> titles<00:00:35.070> here<00:00:35.840> where

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
anything but of seven titles here where

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.260 
anything but of seven titles here where
would<00:00:37.020> this<00:00:37.140> rank

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.549 

maybe<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.420> mean<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.840> guess<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.230> first<00:00:43.379> one

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
maybe I mean I guess the first one

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.299 
maybe I mean I guess the first one
always<00:00:43.860> remains<00:00:44.190> unique<00:00:45.090> in<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.570> sense<00:00:45.780> of

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
always remains unique in the sense of

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:48.680 
always remains unique in the sense of
you<00:00:47.309> know<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:47.489> Curie<00:00:47.850> your<00:00:48.149> career<00:00:48.480> could

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.539 
me feel uncomfortable for at least two
sets<00:03:18.900> I'd<00:03:19.110> say<00:03:19.320> because<00:03:20.010> playing<00:03:20.280> from<00:03:20.519> behind

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
sets I'd say because playing from behind

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.490 
sets I'd say because playing from behind
is<00:03:21.030> not<00:03:21.180> so<00:03:21.540> easy

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
is not so easy

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.560 
is not so easy
you<00:03:22.890> don't<00:03:23.100> when<00:03:23.790> you've<00:03:23.910> got<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.090> second<00:03:24.420> set

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
you don't when you've got the second set

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.440 
you don't when you've got the second set
though<00:03:24.780> did<00:03:25.200> you<00:03:25.290> think<00:03:25.560> got<00:03:25.860> him<00:03:25.890> no<00:03:26.670> I<00:03:26.970> mean<00:03:27.239> I

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
though did you think got him no I mean I

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.210 
though did you think got him no I mean I
knew<00:03:27.750> that<00:03:27.989> this<00:03:28.079> is<00:03:28.140> this<00:03:28.500> is<00:03:28.620> big<00:03:28.829> because

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
knew that this is this is big because

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.530 
knew that this is this is big because
this<00:03:29.370> is<00:03:29.459> going<00:03:29.640> to<00:03:29.700> extend<00:03:29.910> the<00:03:30.120> match<00:03:30.269> by<00:03:30.510> a

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
this is going to extend the match by a

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.870 
this is going to extend the match by a
long<00:03:30.780> way<00:03:30.989> this<00:03:31.530> might<00:03:31.709> now<00:03:31.920> become<00:03:32.340> physical

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
long way this might now become physical

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.210 
long way this might now become physical
and<00:03:33.000> mental<00:03:33.329> which<00:03:33.930> I<00:03:34.290> don't<00:03:34.739> wanna<00:03:34.860> say<00:03:35.010> works

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
and mental which I don't wanna say works

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.729 
and mental which I don't wanna say works
on<00:03:35.340> my<00:03:35.400> favourite<00:03:35.730> because<00:03:35.790> I<00:03:36.120> think<00:03:36.739> Murray's

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
but mentally I know it's not a problem

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.940 
but mentally I know it's not a problem
for<00:03:41.130> me<00:03:41.280> whereas<00:03:42.030> maybe<00:03:42.269> him<00:03:42.630> you<00:03:42.900> still<00:03:43.170> you

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
know wonder sometimes but at least it

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.900 
know wonder sometimes but at least it
kept<00:03:45.870> me<00:03:46.079> out<00:03:46.380> there<00:03:46.829> for<00:03:47.040> a<00:03:47.220> longer<00:03:47.579> period<00:03:47.609> of
