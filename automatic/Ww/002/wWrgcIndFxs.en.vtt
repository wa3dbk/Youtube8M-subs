that<00:02:34.470> you<00:02:34.590> don't<00:02:34.830> really<00:02:35.010> need<00:02:35.459> to<00:02:35.670> ad<00:02:35.880> s<00:02:36.090> it's

the<00:02:38.250> up-close<00:02:38.760> aspect<00:02:39.600> of<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.810> gun<00:02:39.959> really

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
the up-close aspect of the gun really

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.350 
the up-close aspect of the gun really
helps<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:40.680> with<00:02:40.890> that<00:02:41.069> and<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:42.030> reload<00:02:42.330> time

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
helps you with that and the reload time

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.590 
helps you with that and the reload time
just<00:02:42.840> so<00:02:42.930> you<00:02:42.990> know<00:02:43.170> is<00:02:43.380> 2.4<00:02:44.370> seconds<00:02:44.790> when

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
just so you know is 2.4 seconds when

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.140 
just so you know is 2.4 seconds when
there<00:02:45.780> are<00:02:45.840> bullets<00:02:46.110> in<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.350> clip<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:47.150> 2.7

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
there are bullets in the clip and 2.7

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.930 
there are bullets in the clip and 2.7
when<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.780> clip<00:02:48.990> is<00:02:49.020> empty<00:02:49.350> so<00:02:50.010> again<00:02:50.280> you<00:02:50.850> know

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
when the clip is empty so again you know

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.280 
when the clip is empty so again you know
there's<00:02:51.120> not<00:02:51.209> a<00:02:51.240> huge<00:02:51.480> difference<00:02:51.720> there<00:02:52.050> and

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
there's not a huge difference there and

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.080 
there's not a huge difference there and
you<00:02:52.380> do<00:02:52.530> read<00:02:52.860> low<00:02:53.100> quite<00:02:53.459> a<00:02:53.490> bit<00:02:53.700> so<00:02:53.910> run

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
you do read low quite a bit so run

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.310 
you do read low quite a bit so run
around<00:02:54.360> with<00:02:54.510> your<00:02:54.630> sport<00:02:54.989> kit<00:02:55.110> with<00:02:55.200> this

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
points and it is an all kit weapon so it

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.990 
points and it is an all kit weapon so it
can<00:03:07.320> be<00:03:07.410> used<00:03:07.620> in<00:03:07.769> all<00:03:07.980> four<00:03:08.310> kids<00:03:08.640> which<00:03:08.970> is

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
great I do again recommend using this

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.220 
great I do again recommend using this
for<00:03:11.850> kit<00:03:12.000> because<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.420> amount<00:03:12.630> of<00:03:12.780> ammo<00:03:13.170> you

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
for kit because the amount of ammo you

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.540 
for kit because the amount of ammo you
chew<00:03:13.470> up<00:03:13.590> with<00:03:13.800> this<00:03:13.920> weapon<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.910> weapon<00:03:15.269> has

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
chew up with this weapon the weapon has

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.180 
chew up with this weapon the weapon has
20<00:03:17.550> damage<00:03:17.820> I<00:03:18.209> close<00:03:18.510> range<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:19.080> 10<00:03:19.410> at<00:03:19.650> range

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
20 damage I close range and 10 at range

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.280 
20 damage I close range and 10 at range
so<00:03:20.610> again<00:03:20.940> you<00:03:21.180> know<00:03:21.269> getting<00:03:21.570> ten<00:03:21.780> bullets<00:03:21.959> on

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
so again you know getting ten bullets on

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.800 
so again you know getting ten bullets on
an<00:03:22.560> enemy<00:03:22.830> with<00:03:23.209> this<00:03:24.209> weapon<00:03:24.390> can<00:03:24.540> be<00:03:24.720> a

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
an enemy with this weapon can be a

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.990 
an enemy with this weapon can be a
formal<00:03:25.350> task<00:03:25.680> so<00:03:25.890> I<00:03:25.920> wouldn't<00:03:26.340> recommend<00:03:26.790> it

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
formal task so I wouldn't recommend it

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.970 
formal task so I wouldn't recommend it
