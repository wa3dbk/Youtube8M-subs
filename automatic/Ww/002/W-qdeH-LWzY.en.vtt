00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:07.290
 yes welcome to a new one 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.750
 Issue of the jump puzzles follow from 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.400
 guild wars 2 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:17.910
 We continue in the list and that 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:21.510
 this time with the bm spieÃŸrutenlauf we 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:25.580
 are us in the fight flames 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:28.050
 steppe at the waypoint bm 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.470
 and you can also see already there is also 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.189
 already large bandwidth over it bm 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.189
 spieÃŸrutenlauf there we have to go 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.129
 that does not work anymore 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.129
 purely 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.289
 I have exactly this jump puzzle too 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.079
 ever shown 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.700
 in my normal let's play I am 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.879
 I believe in the normal box over 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.309
 only the little one had jumped 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.899
 At least that's what we think 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.309
 have to spin in front of her in the whole 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.280
 and in the back of this hole 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:10.080
 Yes, thank you 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:15.270
 let me bring walked and 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.009
 Do you want to tell me here on the 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.720
 first look through but no here 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.680
 Of course, there is a hole and we have to 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:27.390
 in and then right here right above 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.680
 high and here then we will not 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.689
 even in the fight could synonymous over it 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.890
 jump 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.979
 I have no desire against these 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:40.500
 veterans to fight spider 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:43.140
 so I am out now is also so with 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.670
 speed works it then synonymous without that 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.470
 I have to kill them and we end up here 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:54.899
 the chest is already visible here 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:57.600
 Here we have to go and we move to it 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.299
 us now in some directions 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.090
 without knowing how we exactly 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:09.840
 but I think we should jump 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:13.430
 first of all have to go behind it 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.430
 to get to the appropriate level 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.590
 times here and on these small 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.480
 lead here again and then you can 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.400
 we jump over here and that's it 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.530
 the plane from which we come to rest 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:30.300
 can 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:33.420
 Schwupps are so here you can 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.400
 this little lead and there grab 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.550
 I prefer to bake myself is safer 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:42.780
 and we can open the gates and 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.459
 hallelujah did not solve the puzzle 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.170
 difficult to accept 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.780
 I think at the bottom is still in the month 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.470
 I'm not a little bit alone 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.590
 sure if this was the mark ok 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.590
 first
