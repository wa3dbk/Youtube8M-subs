00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.209
 florida for help from the harley day foundation 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.240
 valkenswaard the engine enters the garage 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.740
 in which two I yes unfortunately it is necessary 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.119
 because the license is as Harley 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.160
 withdrawn yesterday 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.210
 you become a student with a day out as a total 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.250
 stunned 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:31.210
 if I really did not expect not 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.760
 we also see the previous six 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:37.090
 For years it has always been beautiful 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.519
 been a family day where young and old were 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.110
 we have never been problems yes and now 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:42.489
 are they afraid of possible vegetables 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.739
 order disturbances 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.930
 yes that's the argument were already 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:51.070
 orange throughout the country for years 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:52.989
 days to be canceled but nobody 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.000
 gets up there table 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.829
 what those problems then what they exactly 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.170
 expect and from what angle it then 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:04.780
 must come the familiar the hassles 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:06.250
 between mc yes i don't believe it anymore 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.440
 Well, of course, it is one in Geleen 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.580
 hope played last week it would 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.580
 You think that has to do with that 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.100
 I really can't say that I think 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.610
 not 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.490
 I think this minister has been deployed 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.490
 a policy to facilitate MC cannot be facilitated 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.850
 that means to prohibit everything 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:31.330
 where mc members can get there that 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.950
 days is a great start to that 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.259
 but I think if you want that for each other 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.830
 then you have to enter all events 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:41.350
 throughout the Netherlands because they are 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.670
 that people who just come everywhere 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.160
 How lap so you running now 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.750
 what they are talking about 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:51.970
 I estimate threat hop 0.1% 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.509
 I estimate the threat it all self 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:59.110
 previous years where people also argue 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.369
 get together or do I can 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.780
 imagine if someone is your motorcycle 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.190
 That turns you upside down that you're not happy 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.460
 and that there would be a fight 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.259
 may arise, but that can happen in one 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.090
 average Saturday night in every team too 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.489
 happen but of course it does 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:17.230
 quite a bit in the motorcycle club world 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:18.489
 yes apparently we always see that on tv 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.750
 but you are afraid that is here 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.410
 a birds where one would join 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.050
 can come 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.360
 No 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.690
 because that is the years of saying yes 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.560
 a gang war is coming and it will be 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.200
 fought out 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.870
 I can't imagine MC members 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.180
 who themselves also have families 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.960
 would fight on my 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.990
 public events where thousands 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.340
 families walk and thousands of people 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.170
 present 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.120
 the mayor says i want the risk 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.430
 not take it so I will withdraw the permit 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.900
 not just a huge card for you 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.340
 to also appear in a cost 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.280
 me so short in advance 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.270
 yes you can ask what you 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.040
 tomorrow 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.050
 well we had the potions made 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.170
 of course in the flyers there are pins 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.740
 ordered t-shirts 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.940
 there are wish booked and maternity holders 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.250
 invited and yes there is about everything 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.290
 have Athens with for costs 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.480
 made you around 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.970
 I don't have a clear view yet 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.620
 on what the costs are precisely because 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.170
 of course we first of all yesterday 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.800
 started with all stakeholders 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.110
 to inform and yes to everyone 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.890
 make it clear that this year it is not 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.420
 in it 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.739
 if you like you have made an estimate 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.480
 talking about hundreds of euros thousands 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.390
 euros maybe 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.540
 between 1000 and 1500 euros what it 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:39.180
 our tooth would cost and what you 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.220
 are those costs recovered I think 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.650
 that I put it in the interpretation at the municipality 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.660
 want to submit a bill 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.840
 I hope at least you'll go 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.239
 try that I will certainly try you 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.790
 and a huge amount of me came 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.340
 Faith is more than 20,000 people on that 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.989
 engine days off here in every sword 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.780
 there also people disappoint now yes 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.700
 indeed how are you going to let everyone know 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.190
 that it is not because of well as social 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.910
 Media is a wonderful channel to be around 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.300
 fast 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.680
 to spread bios of course 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.450
 mountain guides we were first yesterday 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.370
 started to inform the exhibitors 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.980
 very first hospitality of course nice 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.709
 our racing event every year our 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:23.390
 volunteers the exhibitors 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:26.280
 other sponsors yes everyone who even 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:28.860
 to get involved with something immediately 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.620
 knowing it isn't going through 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.180
 and then on social media to so much 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.330
 to reach possible visitors from 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.980
 this year there will be no high what are you going to do 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.560
 do it on April 26 and thought so 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:44.300

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.300
