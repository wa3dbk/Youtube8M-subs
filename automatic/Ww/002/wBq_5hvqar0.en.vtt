hi<00:00:00.510> in<00:00:00.780> this<00:00:01.230> quick<00:00:01.469> tutorial<00:00:01.650> we<00:00:02.550> are<00:00:02.580> going

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
hi in this quick tutorial we are going

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.730 
hi in this quick tutorial we are going
to<00:00:03.090> see<00:00:03.270> how<00:00:03.419> to<00:00:03.449> calibrate<00:00:03.929> the<00:00:04.049> input<00:00:04.470> level

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
to see how to calibrate the input level

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.909 
to see how to calibrate the input level
on<00:00:04.859> the<00:00:04.980> boss<00:00:05.160> GT<00:00:05.580> 100<00:00:06.210> this<00:00:07.140> is<00:00:07.200> an<00:00:07.470> important

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
on the boss GT 100 this is an important

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.589 
on the boss GT 100 this is an important
step<00:00:08.130> to<00:00:08.189> optimize<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:08.970> quality<00:00:09.090> of<00:00:09.480> your

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
step to optimize the quality of your

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.470 
step to optimize the quality of your
sound<00:00:10.190> unfortunately<00:00:11.190> many<00:00:11.849> players<00:00:12.120> don't

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
sound unfortunately many players don't

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.410 
sound unfortunately many players don't
know<00:00:12.690> or<00:00:12.900> don't<00:00:12.929> care<00:00:13.170> for<00:00:13.530> this<00:00:13.620> simple<00:00:13.950> thing

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:14.420 
know or don't care for this simple thing

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.090 
know or don't care for this simple thing
also<00:00:15.420> given<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.199> fact<00:00:16.440> that<00:00:16.500> boss<00:00:16.800> for<00:00:17.070> some

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
also given the fact that boss for some

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.859 
also given the fact that boss for some
fudged<00:00:17.460> up<00:00:17.640> reason<00:00:18.029> didn't<00:00:18.300> make<00:00:18.449> it<00:00:18.600> simpler

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
fudged up reason didn't make it simpler

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.990 
fudged up reason didn't make it simpler
and<00:00:19.170> clearer<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.529> check<00:00:19.859> it<00:00:19.980> it<00:00:20.400> results<00:00:20.880> in

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
and clearer to check it it results in

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.870 
and clearer to check it it results in
many<00:00:21.210> not<00:00:21.420> getting<00:00:21.689> an<00:00:21.810> optimal<00:00:22.199> sound

calibrating<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:23.970> input<00:00:24.300> level<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.660> necessary

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
calibrating the input level is necessary

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.170 
calibrating the input level is necessary
so<00:00:25.439> that<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:25.680> are<00:00:25.920> not<00:00:26.099> either<00:00:26.400> sending<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:27.029> too

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
so that you are not either sending a too

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.269 
so that you are not either sending a too
hot<00:00:27.390> signal<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.930> overdriving<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.560> unit<00:00:28.859> or

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
hot signal and overdriving the unit or

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.880 
hot signal and overdriving the unit or
sending<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.820> too<00:00:30.000> low<00:00:30.179> signal<00:00:30.599> both<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.769> which

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
sending a too low signal both of which

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.120 
sending a too low signal both of which
will<00:00:32.099> deteriorate<00:00:32.399> your<00:00:32.730> sound<00:00:33.350> first<00:00:34.350> it's<00:00:34.980> a

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
will deteriorate your sound first it's a

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.950 
will deteriorate your sound first it's a
good<00:00:35.160> idea<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.790> reserve<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.090> patch<00:00:36.360> solely<00:00:36.690> for

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
good idea to reserve a patch solely for

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.020 
good idea to reserve a patch solely for
this<00:00:37.140> since<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.040> may<00:00:38.190> trigger<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.640> during<00:00:38.910> you

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
this since it may trigger it during you

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.500

fudging<00:00:42.870> user<00:00:43.050> patches<00:00:43.530> it's<00:00:44.070> more<00:00:44.340> than
