three years now which is quite a long

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.690 
three years now which is quite a long
time<00:00:17.450> I<00:00:17.660> used<00:00:17.900> to<00:00:18.110> perform<00:00:18.290> it<00:00:18.590> a<00:00:18.710> lot<00:00:18.950> like<00:00:19.520> a

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:19.700 
time I used to perform it a lot like a

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.889 
time I used to perform it a lot like a
lot<00:00:19.880> a<00:00:20.119> lot<00:00:20.239> like<00:00:20.509> all<00:00:20.689> the<00:00:20.840> time<00:00:21.700> one<00:00:22.720> moment

00:00:23.889 --> 00:00:23.899 
lot a lot like all the time one moment

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:27.639 
lot a lot like all the time one moment
the<00:00:24.470> concerto<00:00:24.649> comes<00:00:25.220> down<00:00:25.520> to<00:00:25.910> oh<00:00:26.439> it's<00:00:27.439> got

00:00:27.639 --> 00:00:27.649 
the concerto comes down to oh it's got

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:29.740 
the concerto comes down to oh it's got
to<00:00:27.680> be<00:00:27.860> the<00:00:27.980> second<00:00:28.309> movement<00:00:28.460> I<00:00:28.820> think<00:00:28.849> I<00:00:29.300> mean

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
to be the second movement I think I mean

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.620 
to be the second movement I think I mean
it's<00:00:29.869> a<00:00:29.960> hugely<00:00:30.230> famous<00:00:30.529> movement<00:00:31.340> and<00:00:31.630> as

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:32.630 
it's a hugely famous movement and as

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.930 
it's a hugely famous movement and as
with<00:00:33.410> some<00:00:33.710> other<00:00:33.890> violin<00:00:34.250> concertos<00:00:34.699> it's

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
with some other violin concertos it's

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.400 
with some other violin concertos it's
the<00:00:35.149> second<00:00:35.449> movement<00:00:35.570> that<00:00:35.839> really<00:00:35.989> sort<00:00:36.320> of

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
the second movement that really sort of

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.340 
the second movement that really sort of
is<00:00:36.649> I<00:00:36.890> guess<00:00:37.039> the<00:00:37.190> heart<00:00:37.399> of<00:00:37.609> it<00:00:37.760> and<00:00:38.030> I<00:00:38.539> think

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
is I guess the heart of it and I think

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.009 
is I guess the heart of it and I think
there's<00:00:39.559> just<00:00:39.829> a<00:00:40.070> sort<00:00:40.399> of<00:00:40.460> flowing

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:41.019 
there's just a sort of flowing

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:44.889 
there's just a sort of flowing
simplicity<00:00:42.019> with<00:00:42.230> this<00:00:43.030> movement<00:00:44.030> that's

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
simplicity with this movement that's

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.090 
simplicity with this movement that's
also<00:00:45.410> just<00:00:45.440> very<00:00:45.890> sweet<00:00:46.699> and<00:00:47.030> not<00:00:47.659> too<00:00:48.039> not<00:00:49.039> too

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
also just very sweet and not too not too

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.020 
also just very sweet and not too not too
much<00:00:49.399> drama

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
much drama

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.270 
much drama
really<00:00:50.359> and<00:00:50.629> and<00:00:51.019> that's<00:00:51.230> quite<00:00:51.440> unusual<00:00:51.649> with

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
really and and that's quite unusual with

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.799 
really and and that's quite unusual with
the<00:00:52.399> violin<00:00:54.370> so<00:00:55.370> this<00:00:55.609> violin<00:00:56.149> is<00:00:56.749> a

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
the violin so this violin is a

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.809 
the violin so this violin is a

yourself<00:01:33.710> through<00:01:34.280> the<00:01:34.430> instrument<00:01:34.850> but<00:01:35.290> it

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
yourself through the instrument but it

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.070 
yourself through the instrument but it
can<00:01:36.500> be<00:01:36.620> a<00:01:36.650> pain<00:01:36.890> sometimes<00:01:37.280> because<00:01:37.910> it

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
can be a pain sometimes because it

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.200 
can be a pain sometimes because it
changes<00:01:39.080> a<00:01:39.230> lot<00:01:39.500> with<00:01:40.210> different

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
changes a lot with different

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.660 
changes a lot with different
temperatures<00:01:41.570> and<00:01:41.930> and<00:01:42.500> different<00:01:42.920> humidity

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
temperatures and and different humidity

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.450 
temperatures and and different humidity
and<00:01:43.910> it's<00:01:44.330> a<00:01:44.480> very<00:01:44.720> sort<00:01:44.990> of<00:01:45.460> temperamental

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
and it's a very sort of temperamental

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.490 
and it's a very sort of temperamental
instrument<00:01:47.090> always<00:01:47.300> react<00:01:47.570> it<00:01:47.720> also<00:01:47.900> reacts

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
instrument always react it also reacts

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.970 
instrument always react it also reacts
very<00:01:48.830> strongly<00:01:49.190> to<00:01:49.690> bow<00:01:50.690> and<00:01:51.020> hair<00:01:51.710> and

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:51.980 
very strongly to bow and hair and

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.190 
very strongly to bow and hair and
different<00:01:52.790> kinds<00:01:53.000> of<00:01:53.030> hair<00:01:53.300> so<00:01:53.690> it's<00:01:53.870> a<00:01:53.990> very

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
different kinds of hair so it's a very

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.630 
different kinds of hair so it's a very
sort<00:01:54.440> of<00:01:54.500> sensitive<00:01:54.980> instrument<00:01:55.430> but<00:01:55.550> you

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
sort of sensitive instrument but you

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.360 
sort of sensitive instrument but you
can't<00:01:55.880> really<00:01:56.090> get<00:01:56.360> such<00:01:57.110> beauty<00:01:57.590> without<00:01:57.980> the

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 
can't really get such beauty without the

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.670 
can't really get such beauty without the
sensitivity<00:01:59.030> so<00:01:59.330> it<00:01:59.450> kind<00:01:59.630> of<00:01:59.690> goes<00:01:59.900> hand<00:02:00.530> in

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
sensitivity so it kind of goes hand in

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.320 
sensitivity so it kind of goes hand in
hand<00:02:00.740> I<00:02:01.100> think<00:02:01.160> most<00:02:01.670> people<00:02:01.970> that<00:02:02.090> play<00:02:02.300> a

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
hand I think most people that play a

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.750 
hand I think most people that play a
strand<00:02:02.720> say<00:02:03.470> some<00:02:03.830> similar<00:02:04.370> things<00:02:04.400> I<00:02:04.700> think

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
strand say some similar things I think

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.290 
strand say some similar things I think
they<00:02:05.000> do<00:02:05.060> anyway<00:02:06.610> during<00:02:07.610> the<00:02:07.820> rehearsal

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
they do anyway during the rehearsal

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.289 
they do anyway during the rehearsal
today<00:02:08.709> obviously<00:02:09.709> you're<00:02:10.519> focusing<00:02:10.969> a<00:02:11.060> lot<00:02:11.239> on

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:11.299 
today obviously you're focusing a lot on

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:14.020 
today obviously you're focusing a lot on
on<00:02:11.989> the<00:02:12.560> orchestra<00:02:12.739> and<00:02:13.219> on<00:02:13.609> everything

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
on the orchestra and on everything

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.730 
on the orchestra and on everything
that's<00:02:14.209> going<00:02:14.329> on<00:02:14.629> on<00:02:14.870> stage<00:02:14.930> but

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
that's going on on stage but

there<00:02:52.880> is<00:02:52.910> a<00:02:53.030> certain<00:02:53.450> amount<00:02:53.600> of

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
the conductor inevitably has if they

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.490 
the conductor inevitably has if they
know<00:02:58.250> your<00:02:58.460> instrument<00:02:58.940> so<00:02:59.180> I<00:03:00.550> I<00:03:02.110> guess<00:03:03.110> I<00:03:03.260> try

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
know your instrument so I I guess I try

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.290 
know your instrument so I I guess I try
not<00:03:03.650> to<00:03:03.710> think<00:03:03.950> about<00:03:04.070> that<00:03:04.430> but<00:03:04.640> in<00:03:04.850> terms<00:03:04.880> of

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
not to think about that but in terms of

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.320 
not to think about that but in terms of
his<00:03:06.370> sensitivity<00:03:07.370> towards<00:03:07.790> what<00:03:07.970> I'm<00:03:08.090> doing

his sensitivity towards what I'm doing

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.710 
his sensitivity towards what I'm doing
it<00:03:08.450> probably<00:03:08.870> is<00:03:08.990> a<00:03:09.020> plus<00:03:09.350> point<00:03:10.040> but<00:03:10.940> my

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
it probably is a plus point but my

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.370 
it probably is a plus point but my
experience<00:03:12.260> so<00:03:12.530> far<00:03:12.800> was<00:03:13.100> just<00:03:13.870> wonderful

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
to people and hearing how much they feel

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.769 
to people and hearing how much they feel
the<00:04:40.139> music<00:04:40.529> how<00:04:40.800> much<00:04:40.949> they<00:04:41.159> focus<00:04:41.189> on<00:04:41.779> the

00:04:42.769 --> 00:04:42.779 
the music how much they focus on the

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:44.659 
the music how much they focus on the
sort<00:04:42.990> of<00:04:43.080> general<00:04:43.379> impression<00:04:44.099> of<00:04:44.189> the

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
sort of general impression of the

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:49.549 
sort of general impression of the
concert<00:04:45.029> and<00:04:45.150> how<00:04:45.270> much<00:04:45.449> they<00:04:46.039> feel<00:04:47.569> the<00:04:48.569> piece

00:04:49.549 --> 00:04:49.559 
concert and how much they feel the piece

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:51.890 
concert and how much they feel the piece
of<00:04:49.710> music<00:04:50.039> as<00:04:50.189> opposed<00:04:50.520> to<00:04:50.610> necessarily<00:04:51.509> how

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
of music as opposed to necessarily how

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.269 
of music as opposed to necessarily how
you've<00:04:52.169> interpreted<00:04:52.529> the<00:04:52.889> piece<00:04:53.039> of<00:04:53.159> music

00:04:53.269 --> 00:04:53.279 
you've interpreted the piece of music

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:55.459 
you've interpreted the piece of music
and<00:04:53.669> that<00:04:53.879> that's<00:04:54.210> what<00:04:54.509> really<00:04:54.809> carries<00:04:55.199> and

00:04:55.459 --> 00:04:55.469 
and that that's what really carries and

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:57.499 
and that that's what really carries and
I<00:04:55.680> think<00:04:56.370> it's<00:04:56.520> always<00:04:56.819> a<00:04:56.849> very<00:04:56.939> sort<00:04:57.389> of

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:57.509 
I think it's always a very sort of

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:01.790 
I think it's always a very sort of
comforting<00:04:58.499> and<00:04:58.650> very<00:04:59.569> very<00:05:00.569> important<00:05:01.139> it's

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
comforting and very very important it's

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.679 
comforting and very very important it's
I<00:05:02.159> mean<00:05:02.490> that's<00:05:02.729> a<00:05:02.849> separate<00:05:03.149> issue<00:05:03.300> but<00:05:03.569> it's

00:05:03.679 --> 00:05:03.689 
I mean that's a separate issue but it's

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:05.299 
I mean that's a separate issue but it's
very<00:05:03.809> important<00:05:04.439> thing<00:05:04.589> to<00:05:04.710> do<00:05:04.830> I<00:05:04.860> think<00:05:05.009> for

00:05:05.299 --> 00:05:05.309 
very important thing to do I think for

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:07.879 
very important thing to do I think for
them<00:05:05.430> as<00:05:05.639> well<00:05:05.789> just<00:05:06.029> it's<00:05:06.629> quite<00:05:07.050> a<00:05:07.080> large

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
them as well just it's quite a large

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:11.480 
them as well just it's quite a large
distance<00:05:08.339> between<00:05:08.580> here<00:05:09.059> and<00:05:09.210> there<00:05:09.569> and<00:05:10.490> it's

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
distance between here and there and it's

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.869 
distance between here and there and it's
not<00:05:11.930> necessarily<00:05:12.930> the<00:05:13.050> most<00:05:13.520> intimate<00:05:14.520> sort

00:05:14.869 --> 00:05:14.879 
not necessarily the most intimate sort

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:18.230 
not necessarily the most intimate sort
of<00:05:16.099> relationship<00:05:17.099> between<00:05:17.279> the<00:05:17.699> soloist<00:05:18.149> on

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
of relationship between the soloist on

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.850 
of relationship between the soloist on
the<00:05:18.419> stage<00:05:18.629> and<00:05:18.930> the<00:05:19.080> orchestra<00:05:19.499> and<00:05:19.680> the

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
the stage and the orchestra and the

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.920 
the stage and the orchestra and the
audience<00:05:20.279> in<00:05:20.430> the<00:05:20.520> whole<00:05:20.699> so<00:05:21.029> it<00:05:21.569> gives<00:05:21.779> you<00:05:21.899> a

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
audience in the whole so it gives you a

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.879 
audience in the whole so it gives you a
chance<00:05:22.110> to<00:05:22.289> be<00:05:22.529> much<00:05:22.710> closer<00:05:23.129> to<00:05:23.699> them
