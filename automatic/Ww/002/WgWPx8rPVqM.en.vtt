az3<00:00:16.230> I'm<00:00:17.190> using<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.640> 1.8<00:00:18.449> mule<00:00:18.690> fluid<00:00:19.350> pit<00:00:19.740> and

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
az3 I'm using a 1.8 mule fluid pit and

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.380 
az3 I'm using a 1.8 mule fluid pit and
kneel<00:00:20.430> on<00:00:20.760> this<00:00:21.029> one<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.510> it's<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.619> hte<00:00:23.279> -<00:00:24.029> is

kneel on this one and it's the hte - is

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.490 
kneel on this one and it's the hte - is
the<00:00:24.689> model<00:00:25.019> now<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.439> z3<00:00:26.099> hte<00:00:26.939> -<00:00:27.359> I'm<00:00:28.230> going<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.439> be

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
the model now a z3 hte - I'm going to be

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.030 
the model now a z3 hte - I'm going to be
using<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:29.010> with<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.580> 2<00:00:29.910> pack<00:00:30.150> primer<00:00:30.480> hi<00:00:31.170> Phil<00:00:31.470> a

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
using it with a 2 pack primer hi Phil a

4<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.700> 1<00:00:32.730> ratio<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.809> no<00:00:34.380> reducer<00:00:34.950> so<00:00:35.520> I'm<00:00:35.940> using

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
4 to 1 ratio and no reducer so I'm using

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.799 
4 to 1 ratio and no reducer so I'm using
juicing<00:00:36.780> +<00:00:37.469> primer<00:00:38.219> here<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.879> I've<00:00:39.570> then

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
juicing + primer here and I've then

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.900 
juicing + primer here and I've then
mixed<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.410> up<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.739> put<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.399> with<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.579> filter

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
mixed that up and put it with a filter

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.540 
mixed that up and put it with a filter
into<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.540> gun<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:42.960> I'll<00:00:43.680> start<00:00:44.010> a

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
into the gun and I'll start a

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.760 
into the gun and I'll start a
you<00:00:44.730> guys<00:00:44.969> just<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.570> look<00:00:45.750> on<00:00:45.930> some<00:00:46.140> paper<00:00:46.410> on

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
you guys just a look on some paper on

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.330 
you guys just a look on some paper on
how<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.730> sprays<00:00:48.210> in<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.989> few<00:00:49.230> different<00:00:49.340> air

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
how it sprays in a few different air

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.850 
how it sprays in a few different air
pressures<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.149> atomization<00:00:51.780> on<00:00:52.440> some<00:00:52.620> paper

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
pressures and atomization on some paper

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.060 
pressures and atomization on some paper
and<00:00:53.190> I'm<00:00:54.120> going<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.300> be<00:00:54.420> going<00:00:54.629> from<00:00:54.899> 5<00:00:55.230> psi<00:00:55.770> or

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
and I'm going to be going from 5 psi or

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.330 
and I'm going to be going from 5 psi or
up<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.579> 30<00:00:57.030> psi<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.750> Phi<00:00:57.809> Psi<00:00:58.260> increments<00:00:59.100> so

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
up to 30 psi and Phi Psi increments so

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.939 
up to 30 psi and Phi Psi increments so
and<00:01:00.149> I'm<00:01:00.270> going<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.420> be<00:01:00.539> doing<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:00.989> at<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.469> 10

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
and I'm going to be doing that at a 10

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.889 
and I'm going to be doing that at a 10
centimeter<00:01:02.280> distance<00:01:02.730> from<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.449> panel<00:01:03.780> which

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
centimeter distance from the panel which

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.039 
centimeter distance from the panel which
is<00:01:04.019> roughly<00:01:04.260> 1/5<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.700> we've<00:01:06.090> got<00:01:06.299> there<00:01:06.600> once

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
is roughly 1/5 so we've got there once

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.350 
is roughly 1/5 so we've got there once
that's<00:01:07.320> done<00:01:07.560> we'll<00:01:08.070> come<00:01:08.340> down<00:01:08.369> here<00:01:08.610> onto

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
that's done we'll come down here onto

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.719 
that's done we'll come down here onto
the<00:01:09.540> onto<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:10.680> card<00:01:11.010> I've<00:01:11.220> got<00:01:11.369> ready<00:01:11.580> for

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
the onto this card I've got ready for

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.020 
the onto this card I've got ready for
primer<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.299> I'll<00:01:12.390> give<00:01:12.540> you

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
primer and I'll give you

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.380 
primer and I'll give you
demo<00:01:13.360> on<00:01:13.600> the<00:01:14.080> actual<00:01:14.410> panel<00:01:15.190> so<00:01:15.520> here<00:01:16.180> we<00:01:16.270> go

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
demo on the actual panel so here we go

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.210 
demo on the actual panel so here we go
put<00:01:16.630> the<00:01:16.750> spray<00:01:16.960> booth<00:01:17.110> on<00:01:17.410> put<00:01:17.710> the<00:01:17.800> mask<00:01:18.010> on

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
put the spray booth on put the mask on

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.960 
put the spray booth on put the mask on
and<00:01:18.400> we'll<00:01:18.520> get<00:01:18.640> into<00:01:18.910> it<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:21.100> just<00:01:21.670> for<00:01:21.850> the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
and we'll get into it so just for the

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.880 
and we'll get into it so just for the
part<00:01:22.240> here<00:01:22.479> when<00:01:22.660> I'm<00:01:22.780> spraying<00:01:23.110> it<00:01:23.380> I've<00:01:23.530> sped

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
part here when I'm spraying it I've sped

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.280 
part here when I'm spraying it I've sped
it<00:01:24.010> up<00:01:24.070> to<00:01:24.370> just<00:01:24.790> 1.5<00:01:25.150> speed<00:01:25.930> because<00:01:26.200> you

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
it up to just 1.5 speed because you

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.680 
it up to just 1.5 speed because you
can't<00:01:26.500> really<00:01:26.740> see<00:01:26.890> 100%<00:01:27.610> what<00:01:27.729> I'm<00:01:27.820> doing<00:01:28.120> but

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
can't really see 100% what I'm doing but

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.719 
can't really see 100% what I'm doing but
on<00:01:28.900> you'll<00:01:29.290> get<00:01:29.440> a<00:01:29.470> good<00:01:29.650> look<00:01:29.860> at<00:01:30.040> me<00:01:30.220> when<00:01:30.670> I'm

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
on you'll get a good look at me when I'm

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.790 
on you'll get a good look at me when I'm
doing<00:01:30.970> the<00:01:31.150> primer<00:01:31.390> work<00:01:31.690> on<00:01:31.869> that<00:01:32.200> on<00:01:32.410> the<00:01:32.560> car

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
doing the primer work on that on the car

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.770 
doing the primer work on that on the car
I'll<00:01:33.280> get<00:01:33.550> you<00:01:33.640> up<00:01:33.670> on<00:01:33.880> clothes<00:01:34.150> and<00:01:34.390> give<00:01:34.660> you

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
I'll get you up on clothes and give you

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.650 
I'll get you up on clothes and give you
the<00:01:35.080> best<00:01:35.229> look<00:01:35.530> as<00:01:35.770> what<00:01:36.160> you<00:01:36.250> can<00:01:36.520> is<00:01:37.210> our

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
the best look as what you can is our

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.750 
the best look as what you can is our
atomizers<00:01:38.440> in<00:01:38.650> these<00:01:38.860> different<00:01:39.130> pressure

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
atomizers in these different pressure

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.660 
atomizers in these different pressure
settings<00:01:40.240> so<00:01:40.600> as<00:01:41.200> I<00:01:41.350> said<00:01:41.530> before<00:01:41.680> it's<00:01:42.010> 5<00:01:42.340> 10

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
settings so as I said before it's 5 10

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.400 
settings so as I said before it's 5 10
15<00:01:43.240> 20<00:01:43.750> 25<00:01:44.020> then<00:01:44.950> 30<00:01:45.369> psi<00:01:46.030> so<00:01:46.960> it's<00:01:47.110> a<00:01:47.140> little

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
15 20 25 then 30 psi so it's a little

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.580 
15 20 25 then 30 psi so it's a little
bit<00:01:47.649> hard<00:01:47.860> to<00:01:47.979> see<00:01:48.540> because<00:01:49.540> such<00:01:50.229> a<00:01:50.259> light

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
bit hard to see because such a light

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.740 
bit hard to see because such a light
color<00:01:50.920> but<00:01:51.070> you<00:01:51.550> can<00:01:51.759> see<00:01:52.000> out<00:01:52.090> to<00:01:52.240> 30<00:01:52.509> it's

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
color but you can see out to 30 it's

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.650 
color but you can see out to 30 it's
really<00:01:53.140> it's<00:01:53.800> a<00:01:54.100> demise<00:01:54.490> and<00:01:54.670> quite<00:01:54.910> fine<00:01:55.300> and

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660 
really it's a demise and quite fine and

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.889 
really it's a demise and quite fine and
then<00:01:55.930> the<00:01:56.800> droplets<00:01:57.280> or<00:01:57.580> the<00:01:57.820> spray<00:01:58.180> pattern

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
then the droplets or the spray pattern

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:02.340 
then the droplets or the spray pattern
is<00:01:59.200> getting<00:01:59.590> a<00:01:59.619> lot<00:02:00.300> thicker<00:02:01.300> as<00:02:01.690> you<00:02:01.869> go<00:02:02.080> down

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
is getting a lot thicker as you go down

lose a bit of weight if you didn't use
your<00:03:40.430> regulators<00:03:41.090> and<00:03:41.299> maybe<00:03:41.689> if<00:03:41.900> you<00:03:42.019> had<00:03:42.170> to

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
your regulators and maybe if you had to

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.140 
your regulators and maybe if you had to
say<00:03:42.469> the<00:03:42.590> PPF<00:03:43.040> spots<00:03:43.370> on<00:03:43.549> that<00:03:43.670> knowing<00:03:43.819> thing

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
say the PPF spots on that knowing thing

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.759 
say the PPF spots on that knowing thing
they'll<00:03:44.359> add<00:03:44.540> a<00:03:44.810> slight<00:03:45.139> amount<00:03:45.829> less<00:03:46.810> so<00:03:47.810> yeah

purchase<00:03:54.159> as<00:03:55.159> far<00:03:55.430> as<00:03:55.549> the<00:03:55.669> color<00:03:55.909> gun<00:03:56.180> goes

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:56.419 
purchase as far as the color gun goes

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:59.500 
purchase as far as the color gun goes
personally<00:03:57.219> i've<00:03:58.219> got<00:03:58.519> the<00:03:58.609> good<00:03:58.790> top-line

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
personally i've got the good top-line

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.209 
personally i've got the good top-line
guns<00:03:59.840> I<00:04:00.019> would<00:04:00.260> probably<00:04:00.439> wouldn't<00:04:00.799> use<00:04:00.829> one

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:01.219 
guns I would probably wouldn't use one

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:04.000 
guns I would probably wouldn't use one
for<00:04:01.780> color<00:04:02.780> or<00:04:03.049> clear<00:04:03.290> because<00:04:03.530> I<00:04:03.709> think<00:04:03.889> that

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
for color or clear because I think that

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.640 
for color or clear because I think that
the<00:04:04.159> spray<00:04:04.370> fence<00:04:04.699> is<00:04:04.790> a<00:04:04.819> little<00:04:05.150> bit<00:04:05.269> narrow

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
the spray fence is a little bit narrow

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.640 
the spray fence is a little bit narrow
it<00:04:06.650> does<00:04:06.889> open<00:04:07.219> it<00:04:07.340> up<00:04:07.459> as<00:04:07.609> you<00:04:08.120> get<00:04:08.269> the

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
it does open it up as you get the

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.720 
it does open it up as you get the
pressure<00:04:09.650> higher<00:04:09.980> as<00:04:10.129> you<00:04:10.250> saw<00:04:10.459> in<00:04:10.609> those

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
pressure higher as you saw in those

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.020 
pressure higher as you saw in those
tests<00:04:11.290> two<00:04:12.290> sprays<00:04:12.709> that<00:04:12.919> I<00:04:13.010> did<00:04:13.219> before<00:04:13.370> but

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
tests two sprays that I did before but

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.740 
tests two sprays that I did before but
um<00:04:14.269> yeah<00:04:14.780> for<00:04:15.049> a<00:04:15.079> priming<00:04:15.439> I'm<00:04:15.560> perfect<00:04:16.190> um<00:04:16.750> for

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
um yeah for a priming I'm perfect um for

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.180 
um yeah for a priming I'm perfect um for
a<00:04:17.780> DIY<00:04:18.109> by<00:04:18.650> a<00:04:19.269> home.backyard<00:04:20.269> guy<00:04:21.199> absolutely

a DIY by a home.backyard guy absolutely

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.370 
a DIY by a home.backyard guy absolutely
you<00:04:22.370> use<00:04:22.759> one<00:04:22.940> of<00:04:22.970> these<00:04:23.120> in<00:04:23.330> 1.3<00:04:23.780> mil<00:04:24.169> for<00:04:24.320> a

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
you use one of these in 1.3 mil for a

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.070 
you use one of these in 1.3 mil for a
curling<00:04:24.590> out<00:04:24.800> would<00:04:25.009> be<00:04:25.039> quite<00:04:25.460> a<00:04:25.490> good<00:04:25.729> gun

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
curling out would be quite a good gun

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.460 
curling out would be quite a good gun
but<00:04:27.080> yes<00:04:27.259> everyday<00:04:27.680> years<00:04:28.070> for<00:04:28.310> me<00:04:28.460> I<00:04:28.490> prefer

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
but yes everyday years for me I prefer

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.839 
but yes everyday years for me I prefer
slightly<00:04:30.470> better<00:04:30.770> gals<00:04:31.070> are<00:04:31.280> the<00:04:31.340> bigger<00:04:31.520> fans

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:31.849 
slightly better gals are the bigger fans

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:34.689 
slightly better gals are the bigger fans
on<00:04:32.090> them<00:04:32.289> so<00:04:33.289> the<00:04:33.409> model<00:04:33.650> number<00:04:33.979> was<00:04:34.159> air<00:04:34.430> guns

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
on them so the model number was air guns

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:37.060 
on them so the model number was air guns
at<00:04:34.940> a<00:04:35.030> z3<00:04:35.800> hte

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
at a z3 hte

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.200 
at a z3 hte
-<00:04:37.460> I<00:04:37.699> know<00:04:38.060> that<00:04:38.479> the<00:04:38.720> hte<00:04:39.530> -<00:04:39.919> stands<00:04:40.460> for<00:04:40.699> high

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
- I know that the hte - stands for high

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.129 
- I know that the hte - stands for high
transfer<00:04:41.840> efficiency<00:04:42.820> and<00:04:43.820> on<00:04:44.389> pretty<00:04:44.870> sure

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.139 
transfer efficiency and on pretty sure

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.760 
transfer efficiency and on pretty sure
that<00:04:45.320> a<00:04:45.470> z3<00:04:46.159> would<00:04:46.940> a<00:04:47.150> 2z<00:04:47.780> I<00:04:47.810> guess<00:04:48.080> it'll<00:04:48.320> mean

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
that a z3 would a 2z I guess it'll mean

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.129 
that a z3 would a 2z I guess it'll mean
that<00:04:48.800> it<00:04:49.070> does<00:04:49.250> everything<00:04:49.550> from<00:04:50.270> A<00:04:50.389> to<00:04:50.419> Z<00:04:50.659> so

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
that it does everything from A to Z so

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:53.350 
that it does everything from A to Z so
it's<00:04:51.409> able<00:04:51.800> to<00:04:52.099> be<00:04:52.220> used<00:04:52.460> with<00:04:52.699> just<00:04:53.240> about

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
it's able to be used with just about

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.930 
it's able to be used with just about
anything<00:04:53.750> pain<00:04:54.020> that<00:04:54.229> you'd<00:04:54.349> like<00:04:54.669> I'm<00:04:55.669> just

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
anything pain that you'd like I'm just

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.550 
anything pain that you'd like I'm just
guessing<00:04:56.120> that<00:04:56.300> don't<00:04:56.870> quote<00:04:57.080> me<00:04:57.229> on<00:04:57.259> that<00:04:57.349> but

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
guessing that don't quote me on that but

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.490 
guessing that don't quote me on that but
it<00:04:58.280> would<00:04:58.490> make<00:04:58.669> sense<00:04:58.909> that<00:04:59.150> here's<00:05:00.110> the<00:05:00.259> car

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
it would make sense that here's the car

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.710 
it would make sense that here's the car
when<00:05:00.860> it's<00:05:00.979> all<00:05:01.130> finished<00:05:01.159> off<00:05:01.610> if<00:05:02.389> you<00:05:02.570> guys
