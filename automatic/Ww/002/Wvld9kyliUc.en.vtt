00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:07.440
 good afternoon today i want to tell and 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.120
 show how I will glue the aquarium on 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.070
 20 liters sizes 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:18.300
 but his aquarium turned out 370 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:21.600
 millimeters length 190 millimeters width 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.750
 and 202 mm height growth i'm here 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.630
 height will do around 343 150 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.730
 millimeters because I was doing 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.440
 lighting at this distance I need 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:37.140
 will be on the coverage in this video want 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.559
 show what you need to 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.110
 glue the aquarium yourself on your 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.230
 conditions in the first place is it 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.860
 HIV strap angle is desirable but if 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.070
 he is not 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.870
 can use normal level 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:57.690
 I'm already in the usual millimeter brother 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:01.199
 pasted on the inside of the tape and 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.420
 that is, when I apply looking to the glass 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.320
 gently press down no longer slips him 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:13.260
 I also have a loose glass cutter 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:15.720
 there is still a level of 60 centimeters in order 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.689
 to cut when cut to length 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:25.080
 already cut gain pieces more convenient 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:26.150
 will be 60 centimeters level still us 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.159
 will need 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:34.310
 silicone gun itself silicone 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:40.290
 silicone and i took chemlux 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:44.659
 like glue good I liked it so 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:48.390
 we still need a painting knife 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:51.570
 need a scotch a bunch of took lessons 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.079
 cut it in half so more 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:59.479
 economical long enough 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:02:03.329
 Roulette ordinary roulette 5 meter 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:05.700
 most importantly gloves before 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.039
 cut the glass then they can vodnik 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.230
 need all night and not necessarily 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:16.770
 because the glass and proved without grinding 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:19.220
 Kromu can not be avoided in general in my series 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.319
 already were when 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:26.060
 permanent marker to give 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:30.300
 labels on our sizes on glass and 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:37.700
 I actually got a cheap glass cutter 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:40.230
 elk he stands somewhere 3 4 euros like this 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.269
 here, in theory, you need to pour oil 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.910
 inside 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:50.190
 but when you checks I purchased oils and 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:54.629
 she'll show you what liquid to call 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.110
 cutting glass sent me mail worth 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:58.500
 she is 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:02.610
 12 euros per liter I pour this here 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:05.099
 fluid part of the way to here of course 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.340
 minus cheap glass arena 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:10.650
 but farts are the only minus that i 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:14.810
 noticed as it cuts well you can 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:17.640
 say also i use this jar 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.480
 here directly pouring liquid and 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:26.120
 before cutting with the mass of what and 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:29.330
 I spend the line that is quite convenient in 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:33.120
 Leshoz napkin well, that is, I bought a pack 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:35.459
 She is in any store for sale this 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.130
 the napkin can be cut into 4 pieces and 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.960
 enough for these creatures 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.130
 the napkin does not leave well 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:46.610
 degrease and that is, it does not leave 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:50.840
 neither villins nor divorces and more 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:54.680
 convenient plus is to directly 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.450
 degrease and you like that's all we 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.550
 will need in the next video I will show 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.830
 how will i cut the glass and 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:07.570
 prepare it for gluing 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.570
 but he is a server for everyone yet
