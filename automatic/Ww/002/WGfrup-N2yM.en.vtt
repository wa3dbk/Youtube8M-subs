00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:11.989
 facilities 

00:00:11.989 --> 00:00:14.169
 in anticipation of the release of several games 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:16.429
 genre correctional card games 

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:17.249
 exactly 

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:19.789
 horst and fixation farid 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:21.789
 I would like to talk briefly about it 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:22.470
 mine 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.320
 get acquainted with him those who are on it 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.970
 maybe not heard and reminding everyone 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.130
 who is familiar with him the current state of affairs 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.990
 so that was why then repelled 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.880
 when describing the risk 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.160
 so collectible card game three 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.510
 games in which the main attribute 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.450
 are map but unlike 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.160
 traditional card games 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.750
 each player has his own unique 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.770
 deck card for drawing up which 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.550
 banks collect 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.920
 cards are all available player 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.530
 call spell actions are essentially 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.170
 these facts or auxiliary 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.900
 action with game resources during the winter 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.850
 some each even change themselves 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:59.960
 rules of the game 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.850
 for example adding additional 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.760
 found victory condition 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.950
 in each game of the genre are usually present 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.980
 some types of resource needed for 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.180
 card use 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.440
 it can be just those of a different type 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.830
 for example earth mantega gasoline 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.620
 low rates apparently channels broadcast 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.220
 and so on 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.220
 main card set as a rule 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.270
 includes three archetypes 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.910
 there are spells and often 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.490
 creatures called up on the battlefield remain 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.320
 will choose their destruction 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.470
 spells out of the game right after 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.300
 the moment of its application 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.890
 hearth join the creature and goes 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.650
 warm up revenge snip 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.210
 there are also different varieties 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.570
 witchcraft artifacts and other 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.439
 types like 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.189
 which is a combination 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:48.189
 certain properties of the basic three ask 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.640
 except for resources and card types 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.760
 collectible card games there 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.420
 some more characteristic signs 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.670
 namely those that relate to gaming 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.380
 spaces ie areas in which 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.320
 may be a card 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.610
 such elements are 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:04.689
 library 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:07.389
 buried yet not yet entered in one 

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:09.489
 another gaming map area 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.790
 initially the library is located 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.100
 all player team 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.220
 so the library is often simply called 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.599
 speakers 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.099
 first thing changed is removed initial 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.919
 hands and then volume library like 

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:23.969
 the rule is constantly decreasing for 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:26.329
 add extra cards 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:29.009
 horns this area which includes both 

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:30.650
 directly accessible to 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.819
 of application 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.139
 cards are not visible to other players 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:36.059
 maximum total 

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:37.709
 limited case 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.370
 the battlefield i have long exclusive cards 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.560
 currently located 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.369
 directly benefit 

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:45.089
 that is, those cards that the player can 

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:46.999
 use even if he has neither 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:48.529
 one card to hand 

00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:51.250
 mainly on the battlefield is being 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.800
 which can be attacked or 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.509
 block the battle 

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:55.909
 or you can use them 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:58.459
 ability if they are other rose 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:02:59.729
 farm 

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:01.239
 and finally the graveyard 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.099
 this area which contains maps 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:04.499
 released for uah 

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:06.979
 use spells void 

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:09.169
 creatures and often enters the graveyard 

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:11.079
 or some cases may be returned 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.669
 on the group the actions of other spells and 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:15.159
 ability 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:17.249
 in some games in particular the boy 

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:19.370
 gosling have the opportunity to drive out 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.930
 card 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.950
 that is, to completely exclude it from the game 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.919
 removing from all four power games 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:26.249
 last feature 

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:27.729
 unifying collectible 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:29.809
 the card game is clear 

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:31.969
 multiphase stroke structure all 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:33.649
 actions are done in a certain 

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:35.179
 sequences to uniquely 

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:37.519
 allow everything to take shape 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.589
 situation and given the diversity of their cards 

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:42.920
 the effects of a situation are possible 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.110
 it would be a huge amount if not 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.119
 similar structure go 

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:49.429
 for example we offer every turn 

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:51.669
 single player turn on artvin 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:52.849
 Asv Tass 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:54.759
 in some organizations markets 

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:57.430
 where simplified incomes are used 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.590
 with fewer faces to simplify 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.479
 learning game 

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:03.639
 let's look at the meter now 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:05.029
 correctional space 

00:04:05.029 --> 00:04:06.060
 card games 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.019
 which is described in one article on the site 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:10.699
 depth of the space space will be 

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:11.760
 determined by quantity 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.879
 all sorts of action effect 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:15.639
 caused by cards 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:18.009
 Golenko owners this value is just 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:20.409
 huge as cards can have the most 

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:22.180
 various effects up to change 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.870
 game rules 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.470
 the breadth meta space will be 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.540
 determined by quantity 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.250
 card distribution combinations 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.949
 gaming areas library hand field 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:33.529
 battlegrounds and cemeteries 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:35.969
 in ankara given the presence of eighty 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:37.309
 thousand cards 

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:39.889
 this value is so big that 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:41.219
 can be considered close 

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:42.580
 infinity 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.550
 this leads to the fact that the volume is 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.169
 space is incalculable 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:49.110
 suitable for at least some analyzes with 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.949
 the goal was gray out of the game 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:52.580
 what forces developers 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.569
 apply certain measures to 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:56.400
 problem solving balance 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.310
 two approaches became widespread 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.059
 to solve these problems 

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:02.279
 re-release of old as new 

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:02.960
 sites 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.810
 which makes it possible to slow the growth of the total 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.409
 numbers of different cards 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:08.449
 restriction set available for 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:10.599
 use of tournament cards by 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:12.289
 introducing various additional 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:13.569
 format 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:16.360
 so there was a concept in the end that is all 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.080
 engines and garnet tripping elements 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.439
 hungary bedtime 

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:22.740
 In this case, on the board of cards 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.300
 in ankara used by various tagil 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.599
 disabling only one last release 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:30.730
 or the last five or almost all issues 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.060
 or just cards on the field 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.939
 empty 

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:35.799
 and within every meter of game 

00:05:35.799 --> 00:05:38.610
 held its separate tournament 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.010
 however despite all these measures 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.070
 many collectible card game 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.099
 like mohicans and gas 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:46.929
 still scare off newbies 

00:05:46.929 --> 00:05:49.649
 amount of material needed by the treasurer 

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:51.020
 during mastering 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.680
 but to those who are women to her 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.820
 game provide unparalleled 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.279
 tactical depths 

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:58.079
 for which in particular the players love 

00:05:58.079 --> 00:06:00.369
 collectible card games 

00:06:00.369 --> 00:06:03.029
 not to mention the cards themselves will shift the pattern 

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:05.119
 from professional artists 

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:06.989
 which make the game be attracted and 

00:06:06.989 --> 00:06:08.219
 aesthetically 

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:10.519
 at this data I can go there 

00:06:10.519 --> 00:06:12.860
 if there is any question dropped 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.329
 correctional card games 

00:06:14.329 --> 00:06:16.780
 elite suites ha land in particular 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:17.830
 ask them in the comments
