00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.269
 hello I am joffrin damon or 

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:09.309
 company president gde service 

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:10.990
 installed in Paris today I'm going 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:13.240
 show you how to make a good 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.090
 flat train for that you are going to have 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.340
 need a lodge a trowel and well 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.050
 heard a little plaster the first 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.329
 step is to put some water at the bottom 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.589
 from your red to the amount of water and 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:25.810
 plaster that you will put in the trough 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:26.800
 depends of course on the volume of the holes 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.150
 that you have to recap 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:34.770
 then the plaster must be supple 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.770
 in water as follows 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.470
 continue to soup or dhr and the plaster 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.470
 until it forms at the bottom of the water 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:51.130
 I have a small mountain that we are going 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:56.250
 to see to go beyond the water level 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.250
 that's what we're starting to see here 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.070
 you can then spread the surplus of 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.010
 this way and let it act 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.560
 quietly without touching the plaster 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.060
 in the water after 2 minutes you can 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.810
 mix together to get a 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.700
 homogeneous dough 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.700
 mix in this way 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.970
 the whole is now homogeneous and he 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.000
 let's act for a few moments 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.800
 plaster before it is usable after 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.220
 a few minutes you arrive at a 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.560
 pasty consistency like this one the 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.970
 plaster and ready for use for a 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.610
 good adhesion I advise you 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.440
 to moisten the support so the hole to 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.350
 butcher the plaster as you to the test 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.030
 and prepared and ready for that laughs and that's it 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.870
 you now know how to make plaster 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.870
 to fill a hole
