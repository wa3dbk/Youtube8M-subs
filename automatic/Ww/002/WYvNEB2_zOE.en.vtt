00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.809
 and what happens very good family to all 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.980
 I am lady boss and today it has finally arrived 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.930
 soulful spartan halo to xbox 360 after more 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.810
 of a month of waiting since he left for 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.310
 xbox one and finally I could try it and 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.350
 Here I bring you my first sensations 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.350
 after just over an hour of play 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.780
 to start with I have to talk a little about 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.760
 the argument that I tell what happened 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.790
 between the events that happened in 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.710
 halo 3 and halo 4 and it does from the 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.230
 perspective of a virtual confrontation 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.620
 of the Spartan 4 starring the 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:47.230
 spartan davis and sara palmer the latter 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.000
 known to many in halo 4 has 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.100
 certain similarity with the Spartans of 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.680
 halo 4 since the game is divided into 6 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.900
 episodes of 5 chapters each in 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.820
 total 30 missions of short duration not 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.160
 reaching more than 10 minutes each 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.080
 a some even less than 5 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.120
 minutes at the start of each episode 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.980
 we will have a short scene that will narrate 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.460
 a little introduction to situate us 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:11.230
 yes in English and subtitled in the 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.300
 beginning of each chapter through a 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.340
 text box that by the way is very 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.260
 poorly designed by the amount of rivers or 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.600
 holes that the justified text has 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.550
 but that's already a designer thing 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.860
 graphics we are very surprised to see 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.900
 that kind of thing well then in that box 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.740
 dig a little deeper into the argument 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.740
 of the chapter in question 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.689
 I'm going to talk a little bit about the 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.520
 mechanics of the game and that is how many 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.320
 you'll know it's a shooter in 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.060
 third person with aerial view where 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.490
 basically in our mission is to finish 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.740
 with all the enemy troops 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.960
 getting the highest possible score 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.060
 and how do we get this very easy? 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.649
 in the game we have weapons 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.659
 equipment that we know of the 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.399
 franchise although you could observe that 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.399
 there are weapons or skills that appear in 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.220
 halo 3 and others in halo 4 but all and 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.899
 Each of them are recognizable 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.060
 our character can carry two weapons 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.399
 that we can exchange or at the beginning of 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.890
 the mission spending rr points for 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.290
 buy them or by others that we will find 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.030
 during the mission in the case of 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.680
 grenades is the same we have grenades 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.959
 fragmentation plasma grenades and 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.670
 incendiary grenades we can also 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.110
 carry a skill that lasts 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.850
 a certain time since the 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.160
 active as can be the sentinel 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.680
 automatic regeneration shield 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.360
 health or is painting among others 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.130
 apart from that we can also climb 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.840
 to turrets or vehicles to advance in 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.220
 the mission as you can see in this 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.320
 aspect is very similar to a halo 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.760
 conventionally it can be said that at the beginning of 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.090
 Each issue will have the option of 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.709
 active 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.330
 several skulls of up to six 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.280
 available that will bring us 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.560
 multipliers for our score 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.720
 in order to be able to reach more easily 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.550
 the maximum score to get the 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.230
 gold medal the game system is 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.180
 quite simple and also some 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.879
 controls also resemble those of 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.709
 the fps that we already know with the stick 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:59.209
 left we move with the right 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.819
 we aim and with the right trigger 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.799
 we shoot we can attack body to 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.110
 body with the r &amp; b activate our 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.849
 skill with the lb and throwing grenades with 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.310
 the left trigger while we aim 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.989
 with the right stick other than that 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.150
 we can pick up objects from the ground with the 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.860
 Equis and little else to say about it 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.010
 it's a pretty simple system and 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.010
 direct 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.110
 talking a bit about the section 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.400
 technical we are not going to see the cinematics to 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.040
 which we are used to in the 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.840
 last halo since here they use the 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.510
 illustration resource with funds 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.070
 static and moving objects a 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.020
 aesthetic that to my way of seeing remains 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.240
 visually attractive and hits pretty 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.460
 to this kind of game in terms of 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.050
 part in game to me personally has 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.660
 I really liked how it looks visually 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.310
 together with the atmospheric effects 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.110
 explosions and other sound section 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.510
 he is also notable for both the band 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.490
 sound composed by toms high with 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.080
 completely recognizable melodies for 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.090
 the fans and giving it a good 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.500
 setting to the action of the game to me 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.840
 personally this section has 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.520
 especially liked and also by the 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.890
 sounds of weapons regeneration of 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:12.390
 shield explosions etc. that already 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.390
 we know about the previous halo 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.079
 and now I think we 're going to get to the one 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.789
 for me it's the worst part and it's that I think 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.699
 that have not done a good optimization 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:29.370
 of the game for xbox 360 why do I say 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:31.650
 this basically because the game is me 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.060
 has hung three times in 40 minutes and I 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.280
 has forced to restart the console since 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.960
 repeat several entire missions the 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.729
 It's really hard for me to think that I can 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.770
 be my console problem since it's a 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.810
 slim quite new and has never given me 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.460
 so many problems with a game I 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.050
 like to know if there are more people that 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.270
 this happens to you so if any of 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.919
 you have acquired this game 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.330
 I would love for you to find out if you have 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:53.069
 had some problem of this type 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.199
 because if it's not like that then I 'm going to 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:56.669
 worry and if it's really the game 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:58.409
 have problems because I hope that 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:00.689
 solve with some patch because it is 

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:02.819
 quite annoying and I think it's time 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:04.949
 of reaching the conclusions has not 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:06.960
 finished the game with which there are things 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:09.120
 of which I will not be able to give a 100% opinion 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.740
 as is for example the duration although 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.050
 it seems that it is not too long 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.729
 although yes enough rejugable jalo 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.650
 Spartan soult is a fun game 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:18.449
 that is probably more so in 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.430
 cooperative thing that I have not been able to 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:22.080
 try for now and that offers a 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.070
 Satisfying gaming experience and more 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.320
 still for those 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.270
 fans of the universe halo but where you do not go 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.430
 to find a great background in my 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.020
 depth of any kind you have to have 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.030
 in mind that it is a game created for 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.560
 mobile phones and what it offers are games 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.990
 fast you can do in any 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.400
 time of day on the other hand its price 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.990
 it is too high 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.150
 15 dollars that here have become 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.910
 15 euros that although in this version you 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:48.060
 they have added to the flop the cooperative to two 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:50.340
 players and the dlc operation hydra follows 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.020
 being a pasta so my advice is 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.910
 that unless you're a big fan of the 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.390
 franchise and a craving that can not 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.190
 wait 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:58.830
 do not buy it until it comes down 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:00.420
 price because honestly I think not 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.430
 worth paying so much 

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:04.640
 offers considering that over 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.050
 for windows 8 we have it for 5 dollars 

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:09.720
 and nothing more guys this is my opinion 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.730
 about halo spartans out I hope that you 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:15.380
 help to decide whether to buy or not and nothing 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:15.380
 more see you soon chao
