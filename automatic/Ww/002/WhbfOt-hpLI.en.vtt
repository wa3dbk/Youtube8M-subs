00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.400
 spotify 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.600
 Well well, we're all good 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.700
 here in a new video and this time it's a 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.099
 small tutorial on how to connect the 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:19.270
 command of play 4 to the command of the wii to 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:21.039
 command to play 3 but without cable as 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.080
 you see I'm using flip 3 here with 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:27.189
 the material and 4 because basically not 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:30.160
 I have no command of play 4 of play 3 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:32.439
 because good for personal reasons 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.840
 I got angry and he has it against the wall and 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.150
 it suddenly and says and said then I have 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.560
 command of apple and 4 I will save 50 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.560
 euros 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.870
 and nothing because here I have the command as 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:47.230
 You see it is connected by cable but you 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:51.280
 I'm going to teach how to connect it via 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:53.930
 wireless lan without cables 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.400
 and whatsapp 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:00.520
 and for that we have to 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.820
 go to the system settings not 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:07.150
 forgiveness of accessories and pink settings 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.250
 manage bluetooth devices and 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.930
 as you can see, we have wireless here 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.100
 interface device controller 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.619
 human hd 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.150
 and well we're going to give this is because I 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.280
 I have already connected it before then 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.979
 saved there but if we give the X 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.750
 not going to do anything then what 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.050
 we have to do is go register 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.460
 a new device 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:32.620
 we give you we are going to start the scan 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.950
 we remove the cable and as you can see it is not 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:38.860
 turn on the light let's select 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.950
 press the PS button and be a 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:45.759
 the time for a couple of seconds 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:48.369
 or 3.4 there it is worth as you see it is 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:51.890
 beginning to do so to blink and 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.750
 now let's connect the cable again 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.960
 during very little very little time 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.140
 we're going to give echo to select and 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.830
 we remove the cable again 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:06.680
 but all this as a quick plan 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:11.020
 and since it is how you see is connected 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:13.480
 there is the blue stick the little blue dot 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:17.790
 and here it is also connected and 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.790
 as you can see the cable you can disconnected 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.070
 Well, you can play perfectly 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:27.430
 games games but without cable 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.320
 example if you are far from play 3 and 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.720
 you do not want to use cable because look you have 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.720
 I'm good 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.670
 what will I do to load the phone 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:54.050
 Well this is not good but also 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.350
 have forgotten to say that to see the button 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:01.460
 share is the select the start button 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:03.410
 options the start and this pack has no 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.350
 does nothing although we press it either 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:09.280
 does nothing and the playstation button either 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.280
 it works on play 3 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.030
 good in case, for example, you want 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.379
 use the play station button while in a 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:23.069
 game or being in one thing of these 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:26.489
 then you can use the play application 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:29.519
 station both for them and for android 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:34.110
 of my case I have android and for example 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:36.630
 if I'm playing modern warfare will 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.870
 or whites or whatever to any 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.640
 game and send me a message and I no longer 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.700
 I can go to the menu 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.170
 except by removing the disk because I have to 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.930
 open the android application 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.000
 playstation and 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.960
 select a friend and send him a 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.240
 message whatever 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.390
 and nothing this has been all I hope that you 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:01.870
 I liked that it was served 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:05.580
 of tutorials like that but in Spanish not 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.580
 many and nothing
