00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
were to see a replica or representation

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.640 
were to see a replica or representation
of<00:01:13.200> their<00:01:13.350> skeleton<00:01:14.600> I<00:01:15.600> really<00:01:16.170> quite<00:01:16.380> liked

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
of their skeleton I really quite liked

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.340 
of their skeleton I really quite liked
like<00:01:17.400> in<00:01:17.580> here<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.060> folds<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.840> skin<00:01:18.869> I

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
like in here the folds of the skin I

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.100 
like in here the folds of the skin I
thought<00:01:19.590> were<00:01:19.710> very<00:01:19.770> well<00:01:20.520> done<00:01:20.930> that<00:01:21.930> the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
thought were very well done that the

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.380 
thought were very well done that the
label<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:22.799> kind<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:22.979> annoying<00:01:23.250> in<00:01:23.490> there<00:01:23.729> now

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
label is kind of annoying in there now

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.450 
label is kind of annoying in there now
this<00:01:24.659> section<00:01:24.930> here<00:01:25.970> was<00:01:26.970> believable<00:01:27.560> I<00:01:28.560> think

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
this section here was believable I think

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.440 
this section here was believable I think
it<00:01:29.520> leaves<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.790> little<00:01:29.909> bit<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.329> be<00:01:30.420> desired

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
it leaves a little bit to be desired

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.960 
it leaves a little bit to be desired
some<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:32.009> detailing<00:01:32.549> here<00:01:32.759> on<00:01:32.880> the

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
some of the the detailing here on the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.679 
some of the the detailing here on the
underside<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.840> think<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.979> little<00:01:35.280> lackluster

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
underside I think is a little lackluster

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.140 
underside I think is a little lackluster
but<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.750> like<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.140> coloration<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:38.040> like<00:01:39.030> the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
but I like the coloration I like the

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.510 
but I like the coloration I like the
overall<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:40.020> know<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.320> docile<00:01:40.860> nature<00:01:40.890> of

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
overall you know the docile nature of

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.450 
overall you know the docile nature of
this<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:41.700> mean<00:01:41.939> there<00:01:42.090> they<00:01:42.299> are<00:01:42.329> herbivores

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
this I mean there they are herbivores

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.050 
this I mean there they are herbivores
nice<00:01:44.460> broad<00:01:46.310> pads<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.579> their<00:01:47.700> feet

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
nice broad pads of their feet

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.359 
nice broad pads of their feet
it<00:01:48.420> definitely<00:01:48.630> has<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.259> look<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.340> very

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
it definitely has the look of a very

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.920 
it definitely has the look of a very
powerful<00:01:50.939> kind<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:51.840> slow<00:01:52.290> plodding<00:01:53.070> creature

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
powerful kind of slow plodding creature

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.969 
powerful kind of slow plodding creature
but<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:54.960> mean<00:01:55.110> they<00:01:55.229> I'm<00:01:55.409> sure<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.710> they<00:01:55.799> could

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
but I mean they I'm sure that they could

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.580 
but I mean they I'm sure that they could
move<00:01:56.100> fast<00:01:56.430> enough<00:01:56.750> to<00:01:57.750> use<00:01:57.990> their<00:01:58.200> club<00:01:58.409> I

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
move fast enough to use their club I

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.020 
move fast enough to use their club I
mean<00:01:58.740> they<00:01:59.159> had<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.369> be<00:01:59.430> able<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.610> spin<00:01:59.909> around

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
mean they had to be able to spin around

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.120 
mean they had to be able to spin around
quickly<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.689> use<00:02:00.869> this<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.170> isn't<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.530> really<00:02:01.950> a

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
quickly to use this it isn't a really a

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.850 
quickly to use this it isn't a really a
long<00:02:02.909> device<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:04.320> was<00:02:04.439> quite<00:02:04.710> effective

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
long device and it was quite effective

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.819 
long device and it was quite effective
but<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:05.460> mean<00:02:05.810> if<00:02:06.810> something's<00:02:07.170> gonna<00:02:07.439> be<00:02:07.590> going

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
but I mean if something's gonna be going

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.260 
but I mean if something's gonna be going
after<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.129> herd<00:02:08.489> of<00:02:08.640> these<00:02:08.819> they're<00:02:09.030> gonna<00:02:09.149> have

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
after a herd of these they're gonna have

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.850 
after a herd of these they're gonna have
a<00:02:09.330> very<00:02:09.509> difficult<00:02:09.660> time<00:02:10.229> because<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.770> know

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
a very difficult time because you know

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
dinosaur I enjoy both figures but I have

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.080 
dinosaur I enjoy both figures but I have
to<00:04:18.019> tell<00:04:18.199> you<00:04:18.289> that<00:04:18.739> this<00:04:19.070> one<00:04:19.340> here<00:04:19.729> the<00:04:19.909> more

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
to tell you that this one here the more

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.500 
to tell you that this one here the more
anatomically<00:04:20.750> correct<00:04:21.190> version<00:04:22.190> from<00:04:22.510> like

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
anatomically correct version from like

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.459 
anatomically correct version from like
very<00:04:24.260> much

00:04:25.459 --> 00:04:25.469 
very much

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:29.369 
very much
fits<00:04:26.469> my<00:04:27.340> image<00:04:27.759> of<00:04:27.909> what<00:04:28.090> the<00:04:28.330> the<00:04:28.840> ankylosaur

00:04:29.369 --> 00:04:29.379 
fits my image of what the the ankylosaur

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:31.350 
fits my image of what the the ankylosaur
is<00:04:29.590> now<00:04:30.250> it's<00:04:30.400> interesting<00:04:30.639> that<00:04:30.939> I<00:04:31.030> was<00:04:31.210> not

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
is now it's interesting that I was not

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.230 
is now it's interesting that I was not
able<00:04:31.539> to<00:04:31.689> find<00:04:32.050> a<00:04:32.289> glyptodont<00:04:32.949> I<00:04:33.460> got<00:04:34.120> the

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
able to find a glyptodont I got the

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.909 
able to find a glyptodont I got the
daunt<00:04:34.509> I<00:04:34.750> should<00:04:34.930> say<00:04:35.080> no<00:04:35.199> no<00:04:35.379> skip<00:04:35.650> the<00:04:35.740> dog

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
daunt I should say no no skip the dog

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.439 
daunt I should say no no skip the dog
get<00:04:36.159> the<00:04:36.250> dawn<00:04:36.430> which<00:04:37.030> is<00:04:37.330> a<00:04:38.069> mammal<00:04:39.069> that

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:39.449 
get the dawn which is a mammal that

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:43.200 
get the dawn which is a mammal that
evolved<00:04:40.680> to<00:04:41.680> fill<00:04:41.889> the<00:04:42.069> very<00:04:42.310> similar<00:04:42.849> role

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
evolved to fill the very similar role

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.929 
evolved to fill the very similar role
that<00:04:43.840> the<00:04:43.990> ankylosaurus<00:04:44.530> had<00:04:44.860> because<00:04:45.789> they

00:04:45.929 --> 00:04:45.939 
that the ankylosaurus had because they

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:48.029 
that the ankylosaurus had because they
end<00:04:46.120> up<00:04:46.150> with<00:04:46.300> the<00:04:46.389> very<00:04:46.599> high<00:04:46.960> domed<00:04:47.560> back

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:48.039 
end up with the very high domed back

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:50.490 
end up with the very high domed back
looking<00:04:48.460> very<00:04:48.639> much<00:04:48.879> like<00:04:49.090> an<00:04:49.210> armadillo<00:04:49.500> but

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
looking very much like an armadillo but

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.110 
looking very much like an armadillo but
they<00:04:50.590> ended<00:04:50.800> up<00:04:50.919> with<00:04:51.099> a<00:04:51.129> club<00:04:51.490> in<00:04:51.729> the<00:04:51.939> back

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
they ended up with a club in the back

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.659 
they ended up with a club in the back
here<00:04:52.539> and<00:04:52.659> a<00:04:53.110> very<00:04:53.319> similar<00:04:53.680> skull<00:04:54.310> structure

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
here and a very similar skull structure

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.730 
here and a very similar skull structure
and<00:04:55.000> a<00:04:55.030> very<00:04:55.210> similar<00:04:55.599> overall<00:04:56.229> stance

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
and a very similar overall stance

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.279 
and a very similar overall stance
because<00:04:57.550> it's<00:04:58.000> convergent<00:04:58.689> evolution<00:04:58.779> they

00:04:59.279 --> 00:04:59.289 
because it's convergent evolution they

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:00.480 
because it's convergent evolution they
fill<00:04:59.529> ended<00:04:59.770> up<00:04:59.860> feeling<00:05:00.039> the<00:05:00.250> same

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
fill ended up feeling the same

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.640 
fill ended up feeling the same
ecological<00:05:01.419> niche<00:05:01.659> that<00:05:02.110> these<00:05:02.409> creatures

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
ecological niche that these creatures

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.100 
ecological niche that these creatures
had<00:05:03.039> failed<00:05:03.789> in<00:05:04.060> during<00:05:04.629> the<00:05:04.750> age<00:05:04.900> of

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
had failed in during the age of

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.490 
had failed in during the age of
dinosaurs<00:05:06.389> so<00:05:07.389> these<00:05:07.509> are<00:05:07.659> the<00:05:07.719> two<00:05:07.900> figures

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
dinosaurs so these are the two figures

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.429 
dinosaurs so these are the two figures
that<00:05:08.710> I<00:05:09.240> picked<00:05:10.240> up<00:05:10.389> like<00:05:10.750> in<00:05:10.810> the<00:05:10.870> last<00:05:11.050> week

00:05:11.429 --> 00:05:11.439 
that I picked up like in the last week

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:14.790 
that I picked up like in the last week
and<00:05:12.370> I'm<00:05:12.729> really<00:05:13.270> quite<00:05:13.539> pleased<00:05:14.289> with<00:05:14.319> them<00:05:14.620> I

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
and I'm really quite pleased with them I

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.439 
and I'm really quite pleased with them I
think<00:05:15.129> they're<00:05:15.250> very<00:05:15.520> cool<00:05:15.759> and<00:05:15.819> I'm<00:05:16.210> glad

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:16.449 
think they're very cool and I'm glad

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:19.319 
think they're very cool and I'm glad
that<00:05:16.479> they're<00:05:16.689> in<00:05:16.750> my<00:05:16.870> collection
