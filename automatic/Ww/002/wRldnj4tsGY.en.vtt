feel better about everything I've got
something<00:00:35.200> very<00:00:35.739> serious<00:00:36.190> wrong<00:00:36.430> but<00:00:37.180> these

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
something very serious wrong but these

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:46.939 
something very serious wrong but these
doctors<00:00:37.780> they're<00:00:37.960> gonna<00:00:38.200> take<00:00:38.380> care<00:00:38.590> of<00:00:38.739> me<00:00:38.860> so

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:49.349 

the<00:00:47.949> whole<00:00:48.160> notion<00:00:48.429> of<00:00:48.789> patient<00:00:49.269> and

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:49.359 
the whole notion of patient and

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:52.560 
the whole notion of patient and
family-centered<00:00:50.050> care<00:00:50.079> I<00:00:50.559> think<00:00:50.949> is<00:00:51.699> the

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
family-centered care I think is the

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.009 
family-centered care I think is the
notion<00:00:52.809> that<00:00:53.050> um<00:00:54.300> we're<00:00:55.300> in<00:00:55.329> the<00:00:55.480> care<00:00:55.690> journey

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:56.019 
notion that um we're in the care journey

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:58.889 
notion that um we're in the care journey
together<00:00:56.410> it's<00:00:57.190> not<00:00:57.489> we<00:00:57.730> are<00:00:57.969> caring<00:00:58.420> for<00:00:58.449> you

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.690 

as<00:01:31.750> soon<00:01:32.080> as<00:01:32.170> I<00:01:32.290> show<00:01:32.560> up<00:01:32.740> at<00:01:32.890> the<00:01:33.010> bedside<00:01:33.190> they

as soon as I show up at the bedside they

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.930 
as soon as I show up at the bedside they
the<00:01:34.030> patient<00:01:34.540> already<00:01:34.840> has<00:01:35.110> a<00:01:35.410> story<00:01:35.890> in<00:01:36.250> their

the patient already has a story in their

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.150 
the patient already has a story in their
mind<00:01:37.210> that<00:01:37.420> they're<00:01:37.660> ready<00:01:37.930> to<00:01:38.050> share<00:01:38.470> they

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
mind that they're ready to share they

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.930 
mind that they're ready to share they
already<00:01:39.340> have<00:01:39.720> questions<00:01:40.720> they've<00:01:41.080> got<00:01:41.350> fears

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
already have questions they've got fears

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.150 
already have questions they've got fears
when<00:01:42.940> we<00:01:43.150> include<00:01:43.570> them<00:01:43.750> and<00:01:44.530> we<00:01:44.710> explain<00:01:45.130> to

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
when we include them and we explain to

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.400 
when we include them and we explain to
them<00:01:45.490> why<00:01:46.270> we're<00:01:46.570> getting<00:01:46.720> the<00:01:47.020> tests<00:01:47.260> that

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
them why we're getting the tests that

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.900 
them why we're getting the tests that
we're<00:01:47.590> getting<00:01:47.710> and<00:01:48.070> what<00:01:48.250> these<00:01:48.460> tests<00:01:48.820> are

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
we're getting and what these tests are

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.400 
we're getting and what these tests are
showing<00:01:49.300> and<00:01:49.479> how<00:01:49.660> they're<00:01:49.930> guiding<00:01:50.290> our

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
showing and how they're guiding our

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.160 
showing and how they're guiding our
management<00:01:50.740> I<00:01:51.130> think<00:01:51.670> it<00:01:52.330> empowers<00:01:52.660> them

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
management I think it empowers them

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.900 
management I think it empowers them
makes<00:01:53.770> them<00:01:53.950> feel<00:01:54.100> like<00:01:54.130> they're<00:01:54.369> a<00:01:54.430> part<00:01:54.520> of

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 
makes them feel like they're a part of

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.700 
makes them feel like they're a part of
their<00:01:55.030> care<00:01:55.330> and<00:01:55.570> I<00:01:55.990> think<00:01:56.200> it<00:01:56.290> makes<00:01:56.470> their

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
their care and I think it makes their

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.620 
their care and I think it makes their
entire<00:01:57.060> day<00:01:58.060> and<00:01:58.300> their<00:01:58.420> entire

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
entire day and their entire

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.810 
entire day and their entire
hospitalization<00:01:59.560> run<00:01:59.710> a<00:01:59.740> lot<00:01:59.920> more<00:02:00.190> smooth<00:02:00.520> I

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
hospitalization run a lot more smooth I

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.040 
hospitalization run a lot more smooth I
do<00:02:01.420> believe<00:02:02.170> that<00:02:02.200> they<00:02:03.330> do<00:02:04.330> give<00:02:04.780> a<00:02:04.810> lot<00:02:05.020> of

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
do believe that they do give a lot of

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.340 
do believe that they do give a lot of
consideration<00:02:05.229> to<00:02:05.860> questions<00:02:06.310> and<00:02:06.580> and<00:02:07.350> my

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
consideration to questions and and my

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.490 
consideration to questions and and my
concerns<00:02:08.860> as<00:02:09.250> well<00:02:09.429> as<00:02:09.489> my<00:02:09.790> families<00:02:10.410> when<00:02:11.410> you

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
concerns as well as my families when you

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.640 
concerns as well as my families when you
have<00:02:11.680> family<00:02:12.250> around<00:02:12.600> if<00:02:13.600> I<00:02:13.810> don't<00:02:14.020> think<00:02:14.470> of

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
have family around if I don't think of

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.250 
have family around if I don't think of
things<00:02:14.890> than<00:02:15.250> she<00:02:15.550> does<00:02:15.730> and<00:02:16.030> then<00:02:16.780> she<00:02:17.050> brings

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
things than she does and then she brings

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.500 
things than she does and then she brings
it<00:02:17.530> up<00:02:17.650> because<00:02:18.640> I<00:02:18.820> think<00:02:19.120> we<00:02:19.239> have<00:02:19.330> to<00:02:19.450> have

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
it up because I think we have to have

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.930 
it up because I think we have to have
somebody<00:02:19.840> out<00:02:20.320> there<00:02:20.590> to<00:02:20.620> speak<00:02:20.950> for<00:02:21.220> you<00:02:21.370> it

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
somebody out there to speak for you it

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.410 
somebody out there to speak for you it
seems<00:02:22.360> to<00:02:22.630> catch<00:02:22.950> potential<00:02:23.950> drop<00:02:24.790> balls<00:02:25.090> or

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
seems to catch potential drop balls or

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.690 
seems to catch potential drop balls or
errors<00:02:25.810> and<00:02:26.410> I<00:02:26.950> think<00:02:27.190> it<00:02:27.310> certainly

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
errors and I think it certainly

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.479 
errors and I think it certainly
increases<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.630> confidence<00:02:29.340> that<00:02:30.340> the

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
increases the confidence that the

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.090 
increases the confidence that the
patient<00:02:30.910> and<00:02:30.970> family<00:02:31.209> has<00:02:31.630> that<00:02:32.050> that<00:02:32.890> there's

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
patient and family has that that there's

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.250 
patient and family has that that there's
a<00:02:33.190> continuum<00:02:34.000> of<00:02:34.209> both<00:02:34.630> care<00:02:34.989> and

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
a continuum of both care and

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.800 
a continuum of both care and
communication<00:02:36.010> around<00:02:36.130> the<00:02:36.459> care<00:02:36.700> that<00:02:36.910> is

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
communication around the care that is

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.930 
communication around the care that is
not<00:02:38.019> missing<00:02:38.440> things<00:02:38.680> and<00:02:38.890> that<00:02:39.220> is<00:02:39.340> open<00:02:39.820> to

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
not missing things and that is open to

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.789 
not missing things and that is open to
criticism<00:02:40.120> or<00:02:40.750> critique<00:02:41.110> if<00:02:41.380> somebody<00:02:41.650> says

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
criticism or critique if somebody says

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.940 
criticism or critique if somebody says

myself but also the medical students and
the<00:05:31.729> pharmacy<00:05:32.210> students<00:05:32.690> and<00:05:32.840> so<00:05:33.050> you<00:05:33.560> know

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
the pharmacy students and so you know
