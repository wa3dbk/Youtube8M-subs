we<00:00:35.830> are<00:00:35.950> going<00:00:36.100> to<00:00:36.160> be<00:00:36.220> breaking<00:00:36.430> down<00:00:36.610> how<00:00:37.090> to

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.150 
we are going to be breaking down how to

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.690 
we are going to be breaking down how to
do<00:00:37.330> the<00:00:37.450> robot<00:00:37.630> in<00:00:38.080> three<00:00:38.950> different<00:00:39.250> kind<00:00:39.640> of

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:39.700 
do the robot in three different kind of

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.120 
do the robot in three different kind of
concepts<00:00:40.300> for<00:00:40.450> you<00:00:40.540> guys<00:00:40.739> so<00:00:41.739> we'll<00:00:41.890> break<00:00:42.010> it

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.130 
concepts for you guys so we'll break it

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.220 
concepts for you guys so we'll break it
out<00:00:42.190> into<00:00:42.370> three<00:00:42.580> different<00:00:42.760> videos<00:00:43.239> all<00:00:43.570> then

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
out into three different videos all then

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.380 
out into three different videos all then
we'll<00:00:44.440> help<00:00:44.770> add<00:00:44.980> a<00:00:45.040> different<00:00:45.610> element<00:00:45.940> to

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
we'll help add a different element to

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.360 
we'll help add a different element to

how to do the robot this is section 2 on
this<00:00:51.430> section<00:00:51.850> is<00:00:51.910> going<00:00:52.000> to<00:00:52.059> be<00:00:52.150> breaking

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:52.330 
this section is going to be breaking

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.380 
this section is going to be breaking
down<00:00:52.540> the<00:00:52.860> chair<00:00:53.860> or<00:00:54.190> bending<00:00:54.699> at<00:00:54.820> the<00:00:54.850> medium

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
down the chair or bending at the medium

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.299 
down the chair or bending at the medium
level<00:00:55.570> with<00:00:55.839> you<00:00:55.930> the<00:00:56.050> robot<00:00:56.379> a<00:00:56.650> lot<00:00:57.010> of<00:00:57.100> times

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
level with you the robot a lot of times

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:58.680 
level with you the robot a lot of times
we<00:00:57.519> if<00:00:57.640> we<00:00:57.790> find<00:00:58.030> ourselves<00:00:58.120> being<00:00:58.449> very

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
we if we find ourselves being very

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.950 
we if we find ourselves being very
stationary<00:00:59.379> and<00:00:59.620> tall<00:00:59.949> and<00:01:00.540> we<00:01:01.540> are<00:01:01.750> going<00:01:01.900> to

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
stationary and tall and we are going to

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.110 
stationary and tall and we are going to
add<00:01:02.110> the<00:01:02.320> element<00:01:02.739> of<00:01:02.890> adding<00:01:03.670> the<00:01:03.790> chair

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
add the element of adding the chair

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.030 
add the element of adding the chair
which<00:01:04.330> is<00:01:04.920> bending<00:01:05.920> the<00:01:06.460> legs<00:01:07.390> and<00:01:07.990> I'm<00:01:08.290> not

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
which is bending the legs and I'm not

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.170 
which is bending the legs and I'm not
really<00:01:09.220> that<00:01:09.430> gender<00:01:09.700> should<00:01:09.909> be<00:01:10.030> like<00:01:10.150> a

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
really that gender should be like a

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.899 
really that gender should be like a
chair<00:01:10.510> sitting<00:01:10.810> but<00:01:11.110> almost<00:01:11.860> there<00:01:12.190> and<00:01:12.490> so

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
chair sitting but almost there and so

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:14.280 
chair sitting but almost there and so
basically<00:01:13.210> I<00:01:13.330> have<00:01:13.450> a<00:01:13.510> whole<00:01:13.720> different<00:01:14.170> level

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
basically I have a whole different level

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.160 
basically I have a whole different level
to<00:01:14.470> do<00:01:14.710> my<00:01:14.890> robot<00:01:15.250> attack<00:01:15.580> so<00:01:16.270> here<00:01:16.870> a<00:01:16.900> couple

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
to do my robot attack so here a couple

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.570 
to do my robot attack so here a couple
of<00:01:17.320> ways<00:01:17.560> you<00:01:17.620> can<00:01:17.830> get<00:01:17.920> down<00:01:18.159> there

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
of ways you can get down there

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.060 
of ways you can get down there
so<00:01:18.909> let's<00:01:19.120> say<00:01:19.240> I'm<00:01:19.390> let's<00:01:20.290> am<00:01:20.440> stationary<00:01:21.010> I'm

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
so let's say I'm let's am stationary I'm

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.490 
so let's say I'm let's am stationary I'm
gonna<00:01:21.190> take<00:01:21.310> my<00:01:21.430> left<00:01:21.640> arm<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:23.140> I'm<00:01:23.229> going<00:01:23.470> to

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
gonna take my left arm and I'm going to

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.850 
gonna take my left arm and I'm going to
pretend<00:01:24.219> like<00:01:24.280> I'm<00:01:24.460> pushing<00:01:24.820> a<00:01:25.140> stick<00:01:26.140> or<00:01:26.409> pole

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
pretend like I'm pushing a stick or pole

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.459 
pretend like I'm pushing a stick or pole
that<00:01:27.549> goes<00:01:27.610> like<00:01:28.060> in<00:01:28.270> my<00:01:28.450> knee<00:01:28.509> to<00:01:29.229> kind<00:01:29.409> of

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:29.469 
that goes like in my knee to kind of

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:32.580 
that goes like in my knee to kind of
push<00:01:29.649> down<00:01:29.890> and<00:01:30.210> like<00:01:31.210> our<00:01:31.420> first<00:01:31.630> tutorial<00:01:31.899> we

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
push down and like our first tutorial we

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.230 
push down and like our first tutorial we
can<00:01:32.740> kind<00:01:32.920> of<00:01:32.979> add<00:01:33.130> the<00:01:33.340> wobble<00:01:33.729> to<00:01:33.880> get<00:01:34.030> down

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
can kind of add the wobble to get down

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:42.120 
can kind of add the wobble to get down
there<00:01:34.420> so<00:01:34.570> I<00:01:34.630> go<00:01:34.840> here<00:01:35.259> put<00:01:38.009> robot<00:01:39.009> in<00:01:39.329> Shh<00:01:41.130> lean

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
there so I go here put robot in Shh lean

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.620 
there so I go here put robot in Shh lean
and<00:01:42.549> I'm<00:01:42.640> going<00:01:42.759> to<00:01:42.820> do<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:43.000> pull<00:01:44.880> stick<00:01:45.880> now

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
and I'm going to do the pull stick now

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:47.819 
and I'm going to do the pull stick now
if<00:01:46.780> you<00:01:46.869> want<00:01:47.020> to<00:01:47.110> take<00:01:47.259> this<00:01:47.409> up<00:01:47.560> another

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
if you want to take this up another

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:49.920 
if you want to take this up another
notch<00:01:48.070> you<00:01:48.430> can<00:01:48.820> try<00:01:49.000> balancing<00:01:49.270> on<00:01:49.719> one<00:01:49.750> leg

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
notch you can try balancing on one leg

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.200 
notch you can try balancing on one leg
so<00:01:50.409> I'm<00:01:50.619> going<00:01:50.770> to<00:01:50.829> kind<00:01:51.039> of<00:01:51.070> puff<00:01:51.369> it<00:01:51.549> this

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
so I'm going to kind of puff it this

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.830 
so I'm going to kind of puff it this
knee

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
knee

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.260 
knee
now<00:01:53.170> I'm<00:01:53.229> going<00:01:53.350> to<00:01:53.409> pop<00:01:53.619> that<00:01:53.649> up<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:55.149> it's

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
now I'm going to pop that up so it's

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.580 
now I'm going to pop that up so it's
important<00:01:55.659> you<00:01:55.719> do<00:01:55.810> the<00:01:55.930> robot<00:01:56.020> you<00:01:56.320> got<00:01:56.500> to

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
important you do the robot you got to

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.130 
important you do the robot you got to
stay<00:01:56.740> super<00:01:57.070> still<00:01:57.270> balances<00:01:58.270> a<00:01:58.450> key<00:01:58.930> element

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
stay super still balances a key element

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.289 
stay super still balances a key element
to<00:01:59.439> this<00:01:59.590> so<00:01:59.859> now<00:02:00.430> I'm<00:02:00.579> kind<00:02:00.729> of<00:02:00.820> on<00:02:00.939> one<00:02:00.969> they

to this so now I'm kind of on one they
do<00:02:01.630> my<00:02:01.780> robotics<00:02:03.539> really<00:02:04.539> slow<00:02:04.990> isolated

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
do my robotics really slow isolated

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.790 
do my robotics really slow isolated
movement<00:02:05.920> kind<00:02:06.579> of<00:02:06.640> puppet<00:02:07.000> I<00:02:07.179> put<00:02:07.719> lots<00:02:08.590> of

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
movement kind of puppet I put lots of

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.440
