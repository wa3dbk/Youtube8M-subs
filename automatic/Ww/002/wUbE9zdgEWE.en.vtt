00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.939
 if you want to know more about the story 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:09.160
 earth and other terrestrial planets 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:11.080
 solar system where do you start with 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.639
 over the years scientists have come to one of the most 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.070
 common properties of solar 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.450
 crater system of impact origin 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.220
 these remaining of old times 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.079
 planetary history of holes in the surface 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.189
 can tell us a lot about how they 

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:22.960
 changed over time 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:24.369
 but since even relatively new 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.259
 impact crater on the ground 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.450
 changed by the wind of rain 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.489
 and snow sometimes even become lakes to us 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.960
 you need to compare them with fresh crater 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:33.730
 which looks as if only 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.010
 what was formed and where can you find 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.780
 such a crater but of course not on earth 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.000
 but the moon is almost perfect what 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.829
 we need a crater whether or not a small crater 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.460
 strike origin in the western sea 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:44.649
 clarity 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.120
 he is very young and scientists have always thought 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:48.010
 what is a wonderful example for 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.600
 comparisons with other craters and now 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.399
 thanks to the three-dimensional given bitch 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.679
 satellite resolution nasa lunar 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:55.510
 the orbital scout lr o scientists in this 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:57.100
 quite sure and but why 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.140
 use a crater on the moon why 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.479
 it is this crater as opposed to craters 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.280
 on earth and even mars many craters on 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:05.199
 the moon is perfectly preserved because 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.910
 erosion processes there very slowly but 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.860
 even so not all lunar 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.480
 craters are suitable for comparisons after 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.370
 the formation of the crater into it can 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.320
 repeatedly hit and other objects 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.480
 who can change his original 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.070
 form and so scientists were looking for a crater 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.590
 which was able to keep all the characteristic 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.600
 signs as there was a process in 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.340
 crater formation is excellent length 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.320
 suitable for these purposes receiving data 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.250
 instrument or rock mounted on 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.230
 satellite or po 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.450
 scientists have confirmed that he remained so 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.700
 how was immediately after his education 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.070
 which makes it a great example for 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.750
 comparisons they also found some 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.850
 interesting and unexpected things 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.370
 For decades, selenium lagis believed that 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.140
 simple craters like if I form a bowl 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.850
 but thanks to new data scientists 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.430
 found that they are generally speaking 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.230
 resemble an inverted cone and along with 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.120
 other results it sheds new 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.520
 the light is not only on the crater lina 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.740
 but also on the evolution of similar craters on 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.780
 earth moon and other planets giving us 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.610
 better understanding of our history in 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.620
 really simple form of flax and 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.840
 a picture of the scattering of boulders on its edge 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.430
 basic forensic geology tools 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.950
 which will enable scientists to understand 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.319
 how did the crater form on earth and mars 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.870
 before the water and the wind destroyed 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.519
 without such craters as if not on the moon but 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.319
 would not know how to evolve 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.060
 geologically form with time under 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.549
 climate exposure weather and other 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.680
 factors and all this due to the fact that 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:27.329
 at first it might just seem 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.329
 another surface hole
