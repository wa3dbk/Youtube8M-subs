now we talk about the new torch eos 10 r
comes<00:00:16.529> in<00:00:17.100> this<00:00:17.250> beautiful<00:00:17.460> box<00:00:18.140> we<00:00:19.140> open<00:00:19.470> it

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
comes in this beautiful box we open it

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.720 
comes in this beautiful box we open it
and<00:00:19.830> what<00:00:20.340> do<00:00:20.460> we<00:00:20.609> find<00:00:21.650> we<00:00:22.650> find<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:23.220> very<00:00:23.460> nice

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
and what do we find we find a very nice

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.400 
and what do we find we find a very nice
pouch<00:00:24.500> that<00:00:25.500> helps<00:00:26.189> prevent<00:00:26.609> any<00:00:27.090> damage<00:00:27.990> to

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
pouch that helps prevent any damage to

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.380 
pouch that helps prevent any damage to
the<00:00:28.529> exterior<00:00:28.769> surface<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.939> torch<00:00:30.179> when

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
the exterior surface of the torch when

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.690 
the exterior surface of the torch when
traveling<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.470> divided<00:00:32.099> in<00:00:32.189> two<00:00:32.399> sections

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
traveling it is divided in two sections

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.889 
traveling it is divided in two sections
in<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.329> main<00:00:33.510> section<00:00:33.980> we<00:00:34.980> have<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.899> torch

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
in the main section we have the torch

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.660 
in the main section we have the torch
itself<00:00:37.610> and<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:39.480> user<00:00:39.660> manual<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.980> on<00:00:41.489> the

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
itself and a user manual and on the

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.139 
itself and a user manual and on the
other<00:00:41.760> side<00:00:42.200> we<00:00:43.200> have<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.379> small<00:00:43.500> compartment

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
other side we have a small compartment

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.660 
other side we have a small compartment
for<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.270> charger<00:00:45.719> because<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.200> are<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.739> 10<00:00:47.430> R

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
for the charger because the are of 10 R

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.479 
for the charger because the are of 10 R
stands<00:00:48.120> for<00:00:48.210> rechargeable<00:00:49.100> let's<00:00:50.100> talk<00:00:50.340> about

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
stands for rechargeable let's talk about

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.029 
stands for rechargeable let's talk about
the<00:00:50.760> charger<00:00:51.210> first<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:52.260> connection<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:52.890> on

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
the charger first the connection is on

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.459 
the charger first the connection is on
the<00:00:53.190> back<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.090> torch<00:00:54.420> doesn't<00:00:55.230> require

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
the back of the torch doesn't require

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.729 
the back of the torch doesn't require
any<00:00:56.449> plug<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.719> has<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.050> be<00:00:58.170> removed<00:00:58.469> or

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
any plug that has to be removed or

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.889 
any plug that has to be removed or
opening<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.309> anything<00:00:59.789> you<00:01:00.210> just<00:01:00.270> have<00:01:00.660> to

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
opening of anything you just have to

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.959 
opening of anything you just have to
ensure<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.260> after<00:01:01.800> every<00:01:02.100> dive<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.550> RINs<00:01:02.789> it

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
ensure that after every dive you RINs it

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.429 
ensure that after every dive you RINs it
so<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.239> contacts<00:01:03.750> are<00:01:03.930> always<00:01:04.229> nice<00:01:04.409> and

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
so the contacts are always nice and

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.280 
so the contacts are always nice and
clean<00:01:04.890> on<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.970> charger<00:01:06.420> we<00:01:06.600> have<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:06.960> plug

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
clean on the charger we have this plug

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.649 
clean on the charger we have this plug
that<00:01:07.590> just<00:01:07.860> mates<00:01:08.100> perfectly<00:01:08.909> with<00:01:09.540> the

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
that just mates perfectly with the

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.380 
that just mates perfectly with the
contacts<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:11.159> will<00:01:11.369> take<00:01:11.580> about<00:01:11.760> four<00:01:12.240> hours

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
contacts it will take about four hours

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.649 
contacts it will take about four hours
to<00:01:12.810> charge<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.350> battery<00:01:13.770> from<00:01:14.299> totally<00:01:15.299> empty

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
to charge the battery from totally empty

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.960 
to charge the battery from totally empty
to<00:01:15.960> completely<00:01:16.530> full<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:17.580> will<00:01:17.759> give

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
to completely full and this will give

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.660 
to completely full and this will give
you<00:01:18.119> two<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.630> half<00:01:18.840> hours<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.380> burn<00:01:20.340> time

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
you two and a half hours of burn time

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.570 
you two and a half hours of burn time
with<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.390> constant<00:01:22.110> output<00:01:22.650> this<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.250> what

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
with a constant output this is what

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.630 
with a constant output this is what
makes<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.030> torch<00:01:24.450> very<00:01:25.130> special<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.310> we

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
makes the torch very special is that we

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.539 
makes the torch very special is that we
have<00:01:26.790> electronics<00:01:27.450> inside<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:28.560> allow<00:01:29.070> us<00:01:29.280> to

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
have electronics inside that allow us to

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.850 
have electronics inside that allow us to
have<00:01:29.790> constant<00:01:30.240> light<00:01:30.570> output<00:01:31.140> throughout

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
have constant light output throughout

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.429 
have constant light output throughout
the<00:01:32.070> life<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.610> battery<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.290> instead<00:01:34.290> of

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
the life of the battery and instead of

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.200 
the life of the battery and instead of
having<00:01:35.570> dwindling<00:01:36.570> light<00:01:36.810> over<00:01:37.140> time<00:01:37.909> now<00:01:38.909> the

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
having dwindling light over time now the

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.810 
having dwindling light over time now the
torch<00:01:39.509> is<00:01:39.840> made<00:01:40.049> out<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.320> anodized<00:01:40.979> aluminum

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
torch is made out of anodized aluminum

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.139

we<00:04:16.359> have<00:04:16.479> chosen<00:04:16.690> a<00:04:16.989> color<00:04:17.500> temperature<00:04:17.799> of

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
we have chosen a color temperature of

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.520 
we have chosen a color temperature of
thousand<00:04:18.760> five<00:04:19.000> thousand<00:04:19.510> Kelvin<00:04:19.900> which

thousand five thousand Kelvin which

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.230 
thousand five thousand Kelvin which
really<00:04:20.770> brings<00:04:21.099> out<00:04:21.340> the<00:04:21.400> colors<00:04:22.000> and

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
really brings out the colors and

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.780 
really brings out the colors and
everything<00:04:22.990> we<00:04:23.110> have<00:04:23.440> underwater

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
everything we have underwater

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.080 
everything we have underwater
and<00:04:25.270> this<00:04:26.020> pretty<00:04:26.260> much<00:04:26.440> sums<00:04:26.740> it<00:04:26.890> up<00:04:27.010> a<00:04:27.520> great

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090
