00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
something huge also this was just

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.480 
something huge also this was just
something<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.290> don't<00:01:16.560> know<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.650> hadn't

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
something that I don't know I hadn't

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.219 
something that I don't know I hadn't
ever<00:01:17.970> seen<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.330> video<00:01:18.509> about<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.930> before<00:01:19.200> I

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
ever seen a video about it before I

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.679 
ever seen a video about it before I
hadn't<00:01:19.710> like<00:01:19.920> come<00:01:20.159> across<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.700> skating<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.390> I

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
hadn't like come across it skating and I

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.030 
hadn't like come across it skating and I
just<00:01:22.020> found<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.409> other<00:01:22.530> day<00:01:22.680> when<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:22.920> was

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
just found it the other day when I was

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.490 
just found it the other day when I was
messing<00:01:23.250> around<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.840> figured<00:01:25.290> I'd<00:01:25.350> do<00:01:25.470> a

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
messing around so I figured I'd do a

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.109 
messing around so I figured I'd do a
video<00:01:25.619> I'm<00:01:26.040> sure<00:01:26.280> there's<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.549> lot<00:01:26.820> more<00:01:27.030> of

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
video I'm sure there's a lot more of

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.039 
video I'm sure there's a lot more of
these<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.390> are<00:01:27.540> hidden<00:01:27.630> throughout<00:01:27.930> the

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
these that are hidden throughout the

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.890 
these that are hidden throughout the
game<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.939> don't<00:01:30.240> know<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.329> may<00:01:30.570> start<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.869> new

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
game so I don't know I may start a new

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.980 
game so I don't know I may start a new
series<00:01:31.259> with<00:01:31.530> this<00:01:31.680> as<00:01:31.890> well<00:01:32.100> where<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:32.369> try<00:01:32.670> to

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
series with this as well where I try to

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.420 
series with this as well where I try to
either<00:01:33.990> find<00:01:34.229> some<00:01:34.470> different<00:01:34.829> secret<00:01:35.100> skate

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
either find some different secret skate

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.120 
either find some different secret skate
spots<00:01:35.729> or<00:01:36.140> see<00:01:37.140> if<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.350> guys<00:01:37.470> have<00:01:37.740> sums<00:01:37.979> that

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
spots or see if you guys have sums that

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.210 
spots or see if you guys have sums that
you<00:01:38.250> can<00:01:38.369> show<00:01:38.549> off<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.030> stuff<00:01:39.180> like<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.570> I

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
you can show off and stuff like that I

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.280 
you can show off and stuff like that I
tried<00:01:41.220> skating<00:01:41.549> farther<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.240> way<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.570> if<00:01:43.079> you

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
tried skating farther that way to if you

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.749 
tried skating farther that way to if you
make<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.590> up<00:01:43.710> over<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.009> ledge<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.490> really

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
make it up over that ledge it really

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.300 
make it up over that ledge it really
doesn't<00:01:45.030> go<00:01:45.119> anywhere<00:01:45.450> else<00:01:45.540> either<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:46.619> um<00:01:47.250> I

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
doesn't go anywhere else either so um I

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.410 
doesn't go anywhere else either so um I
don't<00:01:47.640> really<00:01:47.790> know<00:01:47.939> what<00:01:48.119> this<00:01:48.210> was<00:01:48.390> for

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
don't really know what this was for

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.920 
don't really know what this was for
maybe<00:01:48.869> they<00:01:49.020> just<00:01:49.259> kind<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.560> did<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.860> because<00:01:50.220> I
