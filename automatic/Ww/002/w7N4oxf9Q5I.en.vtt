wet stuff this may be worth a look in so

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.950 
wet stuff this may be worth a look in so
let's<00:00:38.160> put<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.550> test<00:00:38.790> this<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.840> my

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
let's put it to the test this is my

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.110 
let's put it to the test this is my
iphone<00:00:40.350> which<00:00:41.010> we<00:00:41.160> won't<00:00:41.309> be<00:00:41.460> using<00:00:41.579> for<00:00:41.910> the

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
iphone which we won't be using for the

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.729 
iphone which we won't be using for the
test<00:00:42.360> simply<00:00:42.780> because<00:00:43.079> we've<00:00:43.260> never<00:00:43.469> tested

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
test simply because we've never tested

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.680 
test simply because we've never tested
and<00:00:44.040> vibraphone<00:00:44.309> before<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.059> at<00:00:45.329> this<00:00:45.480> stage

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
and vibraphone before and at this stage

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.970 
and vibraphone before and at this stage
we're<00:00:45.930> not<00:00:46.020> quite<00:00:46.230> sure<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.559> where<00:00:46.710> it's<00:00:46.829> going

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
we're not quite sure is where it's going

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.430 
we're not quite sure is where it's going
to<00:00:47.010> go<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.520> I've<00:00:47.879> brought<00:00:48.329> in<00:00:48.510> this<00:00:48.870> trusty

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
to go so I've brought in this trusty

00:00:49.440 --> 00:01:01.850 
to go so I've brought in this trusty
Nokia<00:00:50.039> 100<00:00:50.910> now<00:00:51.690> for<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.930> dunk

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.920 

so<00:01:02.860> it<00:01:02.950> turns<00:01:03.190> out<00:01:03.400> the<00:01:03.790> Nokia<00:01:04.180> 100<00:01:04.720> is<00:01:04.870> a

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
so it turns out the Nokia 100 is a

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.590 
so it turns out the Nokia 100 is a
pretty<00:01:05.500> tough<00:01:06.100> mobile<00:01:06.730> while<00:01:07.270> it<00:01:07.360> didn't

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
pretty tough mobile while it didn't

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.760 
pretty tough mobile while it didn't
initially<00:01:07.930> die<00:01:09.360> it's<00:01:10.360> definitely<00:01:10.780> dead<00:01:11.470> now

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
initially die it's definitely dead now

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.700 
initially die it's definitely dead now
so<00:01:12.070> now<00:01:12.550> we<00:01:12.610> need<00:01:12.910> revival<00:01:13.300> phone<00:01:13.600> so<00:01:14.470> you<00:01:14.530> get

so now we need revival phone so you get
here<00:01:14.860> is<00:01:15.070> the<00:01:15.160> chemical<00:01:15.400> solution<00:01:15.940> and<00:01:16.150> a

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
here is the chemical solution and a

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.420 
here is the chemical solution and a
pouch<00:01:16.810> that's<00:01:17.410> all<00:01:17.590> you<00:01:17.710> need<00:01:17.890> you<00:01:18.130> pour<00:01:18.400> the

go and then we go so in case you're
wondering<00:01:30.550> what<00:01:31.270> the<00:01:31.540> chemical<00:01:31.960> solution

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
wondering what the chemical solution

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.200 
wondering what the chemical solution
does<00:01:32.710> according<00:01:33.280> to<00:01:33.310> revive<00:01:33.880> a<00:01:33.910> phone

does according to revive a phone

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.480 
does according to revive a phone
corrosive<00:01:35.140> minerals<00:01:35.560> attach<00:01:35.860> themselves<00:01:36.340> to

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
corrosive minerals attach themselves to

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.730 
corrosive minerals attach themselves to
a<00:01:36.820> smartphone<00:01:37.420> or<00:01:37.720> mobile<00:01:37.750> components

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
a smartphone or mobile components

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.859 
a smartphone or mobile components
causing<00:01:39.340> all<00:01:39.460> kind<00:01:39.670> of<00:01:39.729> carnage<00:01:40.150> obstruction

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
causing all kind of carnage obstruction

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.109 
causing all kind of carnage obstruction
connections<00:01:41.410> and<00:01:41.590> causing<00:01:42.250> a<00:01:42.310> short<00:01:42.550> circuits

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
connections and causing a short circuits

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.240 
connections and causing a short circuits
what<00:01:43.690> the<00:01:43.780> solution<00:01:44.229> does<00:01:44.380> is<00:01:44.619> dissolve<00:01:45.040> these

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
what the solution does is dissolve these

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.310 
what the solution does is dissolve these
minerals<00:01:45.759> removing<00:01:46.450> them<00:01:46.600> and<00:01:46.840> thus

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
minerals removing them and thus

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.320 
minerals removing them and thus
preventing<00:01:48.100> short<00:01:48.430> circuits<00:01:48.940> within<00:01:49.119> the

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
preventing short circuits within the

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.859 
preventing short circuits within the
device<00:01:49.600> and<00:01:49.960> in<00:01:50.619> goes<00:01:50.830> the<00:01:50.860> broken<00:01:51.310> phone<00:01:51.869> now

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869

so it turns out our nakia neither just a

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.880 
so it turns out our nakia neither just a
little<00:03:16.599> bit<00:03:16.750> more<00:03:16.930> time<00:03:17.140> to<00:03:17.170> get<00:03:17.470> that<00:03:17.620> power

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
little bit more time to get that power

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.410 
little bit more time to get that power
pumping<00:03:18.459> back<00:03:18.640> through<00:03:18.879> its<00:03:18.970> veins<00:03:19.090> but<00:03:19.330> the
