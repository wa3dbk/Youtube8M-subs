get out everybody it's me again got part
two<00:00:03.480> off<00:00:03.689> the<00:00:04.009> big<00:00:05.009> photocopier<00:00:05.609> here<00:00:05.819> going

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
two off the big photocopier here going

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.549 
two off the big photocopier here going
I'll<00:00:06.870> fire<00:00:07.109> it<00:00:07.259> up<00:00:07.400> it<00:00:08.400> takes<00:00:08.610> it<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:08.849> good

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:09.559 
I'll fire it up it takes it a good

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.190 
I'll fire it up it takes it a good
little<00:00:10.559> while<00:00:10.710> going<00:00:11.660> it<00:00:12.660> also<00:00:12.780> draws<00:00:13.139> a

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
little while going it also draws a

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.660 
little while going it also draws a
bucket<00:00:13.559> of<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:13.769> bucket<00:00:14.160> of<00:00:14.250> current<00:00:14.549> while

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
bucket of a bucket of current while

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.730 
bucket of a bucket of current while
doing<00:00:14.940> so<00:00:15.179> there's<00:00:16.109> something<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:16.529> discovered

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
doing so there's something I discovered

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.519 
doing so there's something I discovered
is<00:00:17.100> is<00:00:17.250> that<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.490> PC<00:00:17.910> inside<00:00:18.270> takes<00:00:18.570> about<00:00:18.720> two

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
is is that the PC inside takes about two

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.920 
is is that the PC inside takes about two
three<00:00:19.770> minutes<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.250> fire<00:00:20.490> up<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:21.570> has<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.750> go

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
three minutes to fire up it has to go

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.710 
three minutes to fire up it has to go
through<00:00:22.170> its<00:00:22.350> net<00:00:22.769> bsd<00:00:23.189> boot<00:00:23.400> up<00:00:23.550> sequence<00:00:23.760> it

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
through its net bsd boot up sequence it

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.859 
through its net bsd boot up sequence it
seems<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.140> little<00:00:25.380> song<00:00:25.560> when<00:00:25.740> it's<00:00:25.859> ready<00:00:26.869> the

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
seems a little song when it's ready the

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.990 
seems a little song when it's ready the
problem<00:00:28.230> with<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.560> console<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:29.699> found

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
problem with the console that I found

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.479 
problem with the console that I found
was<00:00:30.210> was<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.230> have<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.410> board<00:00:31.859> up<00:00:32.040> in<00:00:32.219> here

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
was was that you have a board up in here

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.569 
was was that you have a board up in here
it's<00:00:33.390> got<00:00:33.510> some<00:00:33.660> RAM<00:00:33.870> on<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.980> processor

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
it's got some RAM on it and a processor

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.389 
it's got some RAM on it and a processor
and<00:00:35.730> some<00:00:35.850> other<00:00:36.000> bits<00:00:36.210> by<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.480> looks<00:00:37.399> rs-232

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
and some other bits by the looks rs-232

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.700 
and some other bits by the looks rs-232
for<00:00:38.610> comms<00:00:39.050> probably<00:00:40.050> very<00:00:40.829> much<00:00:40.980> look<00:00:41.190> so

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
for comms probably very much look so

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.369 
for comms probably very much look so
this<00:00:43.710> switch<00:00:43.980> leads<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.730> board<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.379> what

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
this switch leads to that board and what

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.290 
this switch leads to that board and what
I<00:00:46.410> found<00:00:46.710> was<00:00:46.980> was<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.280> switch<00:00:47.730> there<00:00:47.940> wasn't

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
I found was was that switch there wasn't

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.270 
I found was was that switch there wasn't
actually<00:00:48.690> switching<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.469> was<00:00:49.559> kind<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:49.950> stuck

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
actually switching it was kind of stuck

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.670 
actually switching it was kind of stuck
halfway<00:00:50.610> in<00:00:50.910> between<00:00:51.050> so<00:00:52.050> after<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.469> bit<00:00:52.530> of

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
halfway in between so after a bit of

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.639 
halfway in between so after a bit of
jiggering

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
jiggering

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.180 
jiggering
it<00:00:55.649> now<00:00:55.800> works<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:57.140> it<00:00:58.140> boots<00:00:58.379> up<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.980> main

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
it now works and it boots up the main

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.149 
it now works and it boots up the main
display<00:01:03.019> which<00:01:04.019> will<00:01:04.049> make<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.439> liar<00:01:04.710> out<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.070> me

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
display which will make a liar out of me

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.640 
display which will make a liar out of me
while<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.580> boots<00:01:05.729> up<00:01:05.939> slowly<00:01:09.049> it<00:01:10.049> seems<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.500> go

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
while it boots up slowly it seems to go

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.460 
while it boots up slowly it seems to go
through<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.950> little<00:01:11.159> diagnostic<00:01:12.140> you<00:01:13.140> see<00:01:13.320> that

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
through a little diagnostic you see that

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:26.890 
through a little diagnostic you see that
dying<00:01:13.710> light<00:01:14.040> flashing<00:01:14.520> there<00:01:14.700> there<00:01:15.600> we<00:01:15.720> go

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.840 

that<00:01:27.290> goes<00:01:27.500> through<00:01:27.770> all<00:01:27.800> of<00:01:27.950> its<00:01:28.190> startup

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
that goes through all of its startup

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.940 
that goes through all of its startup
tests<00:01:29.330> moves<00:01:29.660> everything<00:01:32.950> another

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
tests moves everything another

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.440

interesting<00:01:34.460> part<00:01:34.610> about<00:01:34.850> this<00:01:35.000> machine<00:01:35.210> is

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
interesting part about this machine is

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.210 
interesting part about this machine is
it<00:01:35.690> actually<00:01:36.020> has<00:01:36.170> a<00:01:36.200> hunk<00:01:36.680> of<00:01:36.800> bending<00:01:37.100> here

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
it actually has a hunk of bending here

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.640 
it actually has a hunk of bending here
with<00:01:37.370> a<00:01:37.430> capacity<00:01:37.910> for<00:01:37.940> about<00:01:38.240> 4000<00:01:38.900> sheets

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.650 

that<00:01:42.650> lower<00:01:42.920> tray<00:01:43.310> there<00:01:43.610> moves<00:01:44.180> all<00:01:44.420> the<00:01:44.570> way

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
that lower tray there moves all the way

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.960 
that lower tray there moves all the way
down<00:01:44.930> and<00:01:45.230> then<00:01:45.410> you<00:01:45.530> load<00:01:45.770> it<00:01:45.950> and<00:01:46.100> then<00:01:46.760> you

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
down and then you load it and then you

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.310 
down and then you load it and then you
shut<00:01:47.180> the<00:01:47.330> door<00:01:47.360> and<00:01:47.690> then<00:01:47.780> it<00:01:47.900> moves<00:01:48.170> all<00:01:48.290> the

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
shut the door and then it moves all the

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.090 
shut the door and then it moves all the
way<00:01:48.530> up<00:01:48.710> and<00:01:49.580> that's<00:01:50.480> the<00:01:50.840> the<00:01:51.350> bulk<00:01:51.560> tray<00:01:51.890> and

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
way up and that's the the bulk tray and

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.890 
way up and that's the the bulk tray and
then<00:01:52.190> of<00:01:52.280> course<00:01:52.340> you've<00:01:52.640> got<00:01:52.820> your<00:01:52.940> a3<00:01:53.390> a4<00:01:53.570> a5

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
then of course you've got your a3 a4 a5

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.880 
then of course you've got your a3 a4 a5
a3<00:01:54.440> a4<00:01:55.870> right<00:01:56.870> you<00:01:57.020> hear<00:01:57.170> that<00:01:57.290> singing<00:01:57.710> that's

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
a3 a4 right you hear that singing that's

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.040 
a3 a4 right you hear that singing that's
the<00:01:58.070> machine<00:01:58.370> ready<00:01:58.610> to<00:01:58.760> go

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
the machine ready to go

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.290 
the machine ready to go
this<00:02:00.380> configuration<00:02:01.190> report<00:02:01.340> I<00:02:01.580> found<00:02:01.880> it's

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
this configuration report I found it's

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.000 
this configuration report I found it's
got<00:02:02.420> one<00:02:02.630> point<00:02:02.810> four<00:02:03.080> million<00:02:03.290> copies<00:02:03.650> on<00:02:03.920> it

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
got one point four million copies on it

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.370 
got one point four million copies on it
and<00:02:04.880> nearly<00:02:05.330> all<00:02:05.570> of<00:02:05.600> them<00:02:05.810> are<00:02:05.930> gone<00:02:06.050> from<00:02:06.229> the

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
to all that very interesting when I shut

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.070 
to all that very interesting when I shut
this<00:02:15.590> door<00:02:15.830> that<00:02:16.300> that<00:02:17.300> tray<00:02:17.570> will<00:02:17.750> make<00:02:17.930> its

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
this door that that tray will make its

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.100 
this door that that tray will make its
way<00:02:18.260> back<00:02:18.470> up

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.260 

something<00:02:21.950> interesting<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:22.490> note<00:02:22.700> that<00:02:22.970> when

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
something interesting to note that when

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.450 
something interesting to note that when
it's<00:02:23.450> on<00:02:23.570> its<00:02:23.690> warm-up<00:02:24.080> cycle<00:02:24.590> its<00:02:25.190> drawing

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
it's on its warm-up cycle its drawing

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.560 
it's on its warm-up cycle its drawing
about<00:02:25.700> 30<00:02:26.030> naps

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
about 30 naps

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.960 
about 30 naps
then<00:02:27.050> as<00:02:27.200> it<00:02:27.380> warms<00:02:27.560> up<00:02:27.830> it<00:02:28.100> the<00:02:28.310> current

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
then as it warms up it the current

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.780 
then as it warms up it the current
drawer<00:02:29.240> goes<00:02:29.450> down<00:02:29.950> I'm<00:02:30.950> guessing<00:02:31.280> that's<00:02:31.400> due

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
drawer goes down I'm guessing that's due

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.820 
drawer goes down I'm guessing that's due
to<00:02:31.910> the<00:02:32.030> resistive<00:02:32.990> nature<00:02:33.290> of<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:33.500> element

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
to the resistive nature of the element

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.220 
to the resistive nature of the element
inside<00:02:37.030> no<00:02:38.030> need<00:02:38.180> to<00:02:38.270> copy<00:02:38.450> the<00:02:38.750> machine<00:02:39.080> is

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
inside no need to copy the machine is

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.950 
inside no need to copy the machine is
warming<00:02:39.590> up<00:02:40.180> need<00:02:41.180> to<00:02:41.210> find<00:02:41.600> something<00:02:41.930> to

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
warming up need to find something to

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.520 
warming up need to find something to
copy<00:02:42.230> now<00:02:42.470> don't<00:02:42.740> I

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530

yeah paper from that fray right now find
another<00:03:39.570> original

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.790 

we'll<00:03:50.340> put<00:03:50.520> far<00:03:50.700> severe<00:03:51.060> erosion

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.010 

I<00:03:54.890> said<00:03:55.640> it<00:03:55.730> takes<00:03:55.850> takes<00:03:56.300> a<00:03:56.480> long<00:03:56.720> time<00:03:56.750> to

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
I said it takes takes a long time to

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.970 
I said it takes takes a long time to
warm<00:03:57.350> up

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.430 

but<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:02.519> way<00:04:02.640> that<00:04:02.909> that

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
but the way that that

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.200 
but the way that that
think<00:04:04.950> that's<00:04:05.130> the<00:04:05.310> heating<00:04:05.640> lamp<00:04:05.850> the<00:04:06.090> way

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.210 
think that's the heating lamp the way

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.510 
think that's the heating lamp the way
that<00:04:06.420> that<00:04:06.570> flick<00:04:06.870> is<00:04:07.020> is<00:04:07.170> just<00:04:07.350> wrong<00:04:07.650> I<00:04:07.950> think

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
that that flick is is just wrong I think

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.720 
that that flick is is just wrong I think
there<00:04:08.610> could<00:04:08.700> be<00:04:08.790> a<00:04:08.910> problem<00:04:09.120> in<00:04:09.420> that<00:04:10.610> but<00:04:11.610> it

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
there could be a problem in that but it

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.550 
there could be a problem in that but it
eventually<00:04:12.390> does<00:04:12.780> warm<00:04:13.080> up

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
eventually does warm up

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.350 
eventually does warm up
I<00:04:13.590> said<00:04:14.250> drawing<00:04:14.490> a<00:04:14.610> lot<00:04:14.730> of<00:04:14.850> current<00:04:15.150> still

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
I said drawing a lot of current still

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:22.480 
I said drawing a lot of current still
still<00:04:15.720> 12<00:04:15.990> and<00:04:16.110> a<00:04:16.140> half<00:04:16.170> amps<00:04:19.730> come<00:04:20.730> on<00:04:20.940> come<00:04:21.660> on
