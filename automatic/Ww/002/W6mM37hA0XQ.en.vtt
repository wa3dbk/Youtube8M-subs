00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.619
 hello to all of you 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.610
 stung one finds oneself in a new 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.860
 video 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.530
 today we will see how to make a 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.590
 bar of life as you may have the 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.860
 see just before in the video I do not 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.170
 want with besides a bar of life of 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.750
 dead as I had you seen the v3 in 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.940
 do not we do this mob pony 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.879
 it's not me who invented it 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.150
 it's a youtuber called yacine 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.510
 mc in his video that already has a lot of 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.829
 time from the 19th of December 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.129
 yes do a pretty good thing by 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.560
 example forget it flashes and I did 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.300
 a son as it says because I do not 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.200
 am not mean but leather he made a 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.810
 website that is not very clean 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.530
 in fact and that he makes orders 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.110
 completely extended and useless I 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.670
 will make orders simpler we will 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.110
 see how to do that right away so 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.789
 what we are going to do is we are going 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.950
 to write 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:30.119
 finally I do not know we'll see but we'll 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.960
 see that right now 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.240
 we are going to make a bar of 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.460
 loading I liked his video we're going 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.270
 take m thought we're going to open our 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:43.680
 map which is called boss test it 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:51.000
 we will make this pony the spawner in 0 I 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:53.280
 know more 11 040 so here is first 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.640
 we will select a block is the block 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.079
 where we will put our block command is going 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.509
 take same was said and we will take 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.040
 the blog that mingle top text when I 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.530
 I will publish it it will be called 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.720
 maybe earlier he's bump or basile 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.090
 earlier it's cleaner 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.220
 we will put the coordinates douyon want 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:17.140
 that they spawn so we read 0 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:20.200
 4 0 and we're going back are so by 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.520
 example let's say for example we're going 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.630
 put a color so to be the 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.700
 colors must put the symbol 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.320
 paragraph we will put a color so 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.130
 to see all the colors of 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:33.550
 Minecraft 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:36.940
 so we did just so we will be in 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.680
 put a code on the wiki and there we 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:44.200
 is colored so for example we're going 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:45.790
 put the 4 here are four no need to 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:53.650
 to make spaces and there we want to put 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:03:00.459
 for example good the holding of points 10 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:03.730
 % and we'll put a bar that 10% 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.890
 we're going to put a wine bar and we're going and 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.930
 yann in order then we have the choice in 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.060
 my son you come back in aragon and weezer 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.830
 boss why because long time dragon 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.110
 to 2.5 points of city to the izards has 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.540
 300 so according to your calculations it can be 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.980
 more practical of the art or the other so 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.959
 we are going to take a long time ragon and we 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.680
 will make a 7 blocks to start and 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:26.080
 we will do filter the gesture 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.959
 redesign can read and save on 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:32.500
 will expand the selection we will remove it 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:35.710
 and we're going to do a second block so the 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:40.060
 same spawn cords there we want m 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:42.640
 50% we will go up fast enough 50% it's done 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.400
 100 points of life and we will make a blog 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.110
 data it will avoid breaking the 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.460
 spoiler in fact we're just going to replace the 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:53.620
 data made filter is there because 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:04:04.840
 a load of shit we'll stop 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:17.070
 at 99.99 needed filter ah no we get 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:17.070
 was cheating 99 it's going to be 99.2 fm 18 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.380
 20 18 yes that's it i do not even know 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.030
 to count is not bad we remake filter 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:30.160
 it's going to change anything it will just 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.160
 replace the command do not worry 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:45.139
 and the last one we'll do a little and in 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:49.729
 here with an air in addition it will be him and 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:51.830
 there we will reset and we will make a 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:55.389
 blog data also actually filter and on 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:57.500
 record see what it gives in game 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:01.840
 it may be ugly we do not know 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:04.840
 serious so now buttons and a 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.840
 hospital 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:19.990
 and there if you go see the eye ding the 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:22.539
 heading error at 7 for ac either rail 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:25.940
 broken through the block 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:29.740
 I've never tried that there's always 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.740
 a little and that's no 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:41.280
 it's big anything good it's 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.800
 pretty funny if you do you've seen 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.330
 1 0 it makes that there are explosions there 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.370
 are there in the wheel that explodes it's 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.470
 pretty funny but I think you have 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.540
 seen up the eye ding there is the 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.850
 lightning and there you saw there are some 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:56.610
 xp particles what I broke this 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:06:00.060
 spawner actually at the beginning when I them 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:02.490
 machines and c-17 block I'm doing that 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:06.030
 makes sure that in fact I break this 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:08.760
 happiness I do not think I'm breaking 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:11.400
 but if I replace it and break it 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:15.169
 on a destroyer actually for although 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:17.970
 it takes its value so its necessarily 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:20.789
 do xp that's why I like me 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:23.699
 the blog data after that so it avoids 

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:25.260
 to make xp I believe in god all said 

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:28.530
 you put the color as you want 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:30.419
 you put life in fact it is adjusted 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:35.310
 you see when I do the loading 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:37.470
 his life in the world and here you are I hope 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.610
 that this video will have pleased you 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:41.870
 found next time for a 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.870
 new video to the next
