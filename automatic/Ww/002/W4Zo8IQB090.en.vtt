good<00:03:41.049> gas<00:03:41.350> mileage<00:03:41.769> but<00:03:42.250> it's<00:03:42.370> not<00:03:42.549> a<00:03:42.580> vvt-i

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
good gas mileage but it's not a vvt-i

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.180 
good gas mileage but it's not a vvt-i
I'm<00:03:43.630> not<00:03:44.170> really<00:03:44.350> worried<00:03:44.650> about<00:03:44.799> that<00:03:44.980> the

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
I'm not really worried about that the

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.400 
I'm not really worried about that the
vvt-i<00:03:45.610> system<00:03:46.180> at<00:03:46.299> Toyota<00:03:46.690> makes<00:03:46.840> is<00:03:46.989> really

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
vvt-i system at Toyota makes is really

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.190 
vvt-i system at Toyota makes is really
more<00:03:47.560> for<00:03:47.739> gas<00:03:47.920> mileage<00:03:48.400> and<00:03:48.519> not<00:03:49.060> so<00:03:49.299> much<00:03:49.360> for

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
more for gas mileage and not so much for

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.370 
more for gas mileage and not so much for
performance<00:03:50.799> in<00:03:50.980> so<00:03:52.019> really<00:03:53.019> when<00:03:53.260> it<00:03:53.350> comes

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
performance in so really when it comes

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.470 
performance in so really when it comes
with<00:03:53.709> TC<00:03:54.040> you<00:03:54.190> really<00:03:54.459> get<00:03:54.580> a<00:03:54.610> full<00:03:54.910> package

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
with TC you really get a full package

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.420 
with TC you really get a full package
and<00:03:55.690> it's<00:03:56.110> not<00:03:56.260> very<00:03:56.320> often<00:03:56.890> that<00:03:57.130> you<00:03:57.220> get<00:03:57.370> a

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
and it's not very often that you get a

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.949 
and it's not very often that you get a
coupe<00:03:57.700> that's<00:03:58.120> going<00:03:58.269> to<00:03:58.330> be<00:03:58.420> fun<00:03:58.450> to<00:03:58.750> drive

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
coupe that's going to be fun to drive

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.509 
coupe that's going to be fun to drive
it's<00:03:59.410> going<00:03:59.530> to<00:03:59.560> be<00:03:59.650> a<00:03:59.680> great<00:03:59.830> daily<00:04:00.280> driver

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
it's going to be a great daily driver

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:01.670 
it's going to be a great daily driver
and<00:04:00.880> that's<00:04:01.060> also<00:04:01.299> going<00:04:01.480> to

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
and that's also going to

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.800 
and that's also going to
fuel<00:04:01.890> efficient<00:04:02.400> so<00:04:02.849> there<00:04:03.540> you<00:04:03.659> have<00:04:03.719> it

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
fuel efficient so there you have it

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.199 
fuel efficient so there you have it
really<00:04:04.230> that's<00:04:04.620> going<00:04:04.920> to<00:04:04.980> sum<00:04:05.159> up<00:04:05.189> the<00:04:05.370> TC<00:04:05.730> so

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
really that's going to sum up the TC so

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.230 
really that's going to sum up the TC so
let's<00:04:06.359> take<00:04:06.510> quick<00:04:06.780> test<00:04:06.989> drive
