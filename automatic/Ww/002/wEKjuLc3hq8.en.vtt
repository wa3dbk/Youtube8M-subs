explain all of this to us so why how
come<00:00:35.040> this<00:00:35.399> Eclipse<00:00:35.850> has<00:00:36.329> that<00:00:36.600> ring<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:36.989> fire

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
come this Eclipse has that ring of fire

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.660 
come this Eclipse has that ring of fire
around<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.649> unlike<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.070> others<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:38.550> we've

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
around it unlike the others that we've

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.389 
around it unlike the others that we've
seen<00:00:38.910> well<00:00:39.210> this<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.660> solar<00:00:40.399> spectacular

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
seen well this is a solar spectacular

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.950 
seen well this is a solar spectacular
that<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.700> can<00:00:41.850> talk<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.090> your<00:00:42.300> grandkids

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
that you can talk to your grandkids

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.560 
that you can talk to your grandkids
about<00:00:43.170> once<00:00:44.010> every<00:00:44.160> few<00:00:44.430> decades<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:45.390> moon

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
about once every few decades the moon

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.420 
about once every few decades the moon
goes<00:00:45.840> in<00:00:46.020> front<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.440> Sun<00:00:46.710> that's<00:00:46.980> called<00:00:47.250> a

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
goes in front of the Sun that's called a

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.520 
goes in front of the Sun that's called a
solar<00:00:48.120> eclipse<00:00:48.329> however<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.200> moon<00:00:49.350> is

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
solar eclipse however the moon is

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.950 
solar eclipse however the moon is
farther<00:00:49.920> away<00:00:50.210> therefore<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.390> disk<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.930> the

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
farther away therefore the disk of the

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.529 
farther away therefore the disk of the
moon<00:00:52.170> does<00:00:52.500> not<00:00:52.890> cover<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.670> disk<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.360> Sun

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
moon does not cover the disk of the Sun

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.439 
moon does not cover the disk of the Sun
it<00:00:55.140> leaves<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.649> halo<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.430> Ring<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.850> Fire<00:00:56.910> and

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
it leaves a halo the Ring of Fire and

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.540 
it leaves a halo the Ring of Fire and
the<00:00:57.510> only<00:00:57.989> happens<00:00:58.469> once<00:00:58.710> every<00:00:58.920> few<00:00:59.219> decades

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
the only happens once every few decades

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.060 
the only happens once every few decades
and<00:01:00.270> yeah<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.140> was<00:01:01.260> reading<00:01:01.559> this<00:01:01.620> morning<00:01:01.949> that

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
and yeah I was reading this morning that

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.740 
and yeah I was reading this morning that
the<00:01:02.160> moon<00:01:02.309> doesn't<00:01:02.489> go<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.030> perfect<00:01:03.449> circle

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
the moon doesn't go in a perfect circle

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.420 
the moon doesn't go in a perfect circle
that's<00:01:04.170> right<00:01:04.320> around<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.100> that's<00:01:05.250> what

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
that's right around and that's what

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.700 
that's right around and that's what
causes<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.939> be<00:01:06.090> almost<00:01:06.240> an<00:01:06.540> oblong<00:01:07.170> circle

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
causes it to be almost an oblong circle

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.130 
causes it to be almost an oblong circle
at<00:01:07.799> one<00:01:07.950> point<00:01:08.220> that's<00:01:08.670> right<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:09.479> say<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.990> that

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
at one point that's right I say and that

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.870 
at one point that's right I say and that
puts<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.470> closer<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.430> creates<00:01:11.760> this

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
puts it closer and creates this

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.490 
puts it closer and creates this
incredible<00:01:12.420> ring<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.810> fire<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.200> what's<00:01:13.380> the

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
incredible ring of fire so what's the

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.039 
incredible ring of fire so what's the
best<00:01:13.740> way<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.979> look<00:01:14.760> at<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.000> if<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.570> are<00:01:15.600> close

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
best way to look at it if you are close

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.510 
best way to look at it if you are close
enough<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.439> see<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:16.890> our<00:01:17.070> friends<00:01:17.369> in<00:01:17.430> the

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
enough to see it and our friends in the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.940 
enough to see it and our friends in the
west<00:01:17.670> coast<00:01:17.880> well<00:01:18.390> before<00:01:19.080> for<00:01:19.350> God's<00:01:19.530> sake<00:01:19.770> do

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
west coast well before for God's sake do

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.859 
west coast well before for God's sake do
not<00:01:19.979> look<00:01:20.549> at<00:01:20.729> this<00:01:20.909> thing<00:01:21.090> with<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.299> telescope

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
not look at this thing with a telescope

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.050 
not look at this thing with a telescope
that's<00:01:22.470> what<00:01:22.680> Galileo<00:01:23.130> did<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.670> he<00:01:23.759> burned

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
that's what Galileo did and he burned

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.270 
that's what Galileo did and he burned
out<00:01:24.270> one<00:01:24.509> high<00:01:24.659> as<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.900> consequence<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:26.040> best
