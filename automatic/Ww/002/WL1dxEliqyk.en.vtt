well it's quite clear that 2013 wasn't a
great<00:00:18.300> year<00:00:18.509> for<00:00:18.539> us

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:19.279 
great year for us

the<00:00:20.279> riders<00:00:20.609> had<00:00:20.759> injured<00:00:21.060> pretty<00:00:21.900> heavily

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
the riders had injured pretty heavily

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.589 
the riders had injured pretty heavily
liam<00:00:23.460> already<00:00:23.730> early<00:00:24.029> in<00:00:24.089> the<00:00:24.179> season<00:00:24.390> and

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:24.599 
liam already early in the season and

liam already early in the season and
jonathan<00:00:25.080> towards<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.619> end<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.099> season

jonathan towards the end of the season
in<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.249> way<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.669> allowed<00:00:29.939> us<00:00:30.119> time<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.320> recap

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
in a way it allowed us time to to recap

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.800 
in a way it allowed us time to to recap
and<00:00:31.980> think<00:00:32.220> the<00:00:32.940> bike<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.330> what<00:00:33.420> we<00:00:33.540> will<00:00:33.660> be

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:33.810 
and think the bike and what we will be

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.800 
and think the bike and what we will be
needing<00:00:34.140> for<00:00:34.170> 2014<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.760> we<00:00:35.790> are<00:00:35.970> very<00:00:36.180> early<00:00:36.630> in

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:36.810 
needing for 2014 so we are very early in

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.280 
needing for 2014 so we are very early in
the<00:00:36.900> season<00:00:37.110> already<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.650> big<00:00:38.250> plan<00:00:38.490> and<00:00:38.760> big

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
the season already a big plan and big

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.680 
the season already a big plan and big
development<00:00:40.290> plan<00:00:40.500> ready<00:00:40.760> we<00:00:41.760> were<00:00:41.940> moving<00:00:42.540> on

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
development plan ready we were moving on

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.600 
development plan ready we were moving on
a<00:00:42.990> lot<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.530> new<00:00:43.650> parts<00:00:44.070> have<00:00:44.190> been<00:00:44.310> brought<00:00:44.580> in

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
a lot of new parts have been brought in

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.850 
a lot of new parts have been brought in
to<00:00:44.970> the<00:00:45.210> bike

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
to the bike

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.060 
to the bike
having<00:00:47.130> upgraded<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.790> massively<00:00:48.330> over

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
having upgraded that massively over

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.330 
having upgraded that massively over
we<00:00:50.610> had<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.760> big<00:00:51.030> testing<00:00:51.390> phase<00:00:51.930> as<00:00:52.110> well

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
we had a big testing phase as well

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.630 
we had a big testing phase as well
yeah<00:00:54.340> I<00:00:54.370> think<00:00:54.879> I<00:00:55.030> can<00:00:55.180> say<00:00:55.420> we<00:00:55.629> have<00:00:55.750> better

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
yeah I think I can say we have better

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.470 
yeah I think I can say we have better
people<00:00:57.640> before<00:00:59.670> going<00:01:00.670> into<00:01:00.789> the<00:01:00.879> season<00:01:01.180> we

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
people before going into the season we

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.630 
people before going into the season we
we<00:01:01.989> have<00:01:02.110> quite<00:01:02.410> a<00:01:02.440> different<00:01:02.949> package<00:01:03.370> than

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
we have quite a different package than

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.050 
we have quite a different package than
before<00:01:03.969> the<00:01:04.690> electronic<00:01:05.500> controls<00:01:06.460> best<00:01:06.970> that

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
before the electronic controls best that

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.520 
before the electronic controls best that
have<00:01:07.150> been<00:01:07.240> taken<00:01:07.600> over<00:01:07.659> independently<00:01:08.409> from

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
have been taken over independently from

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.139 
have been taken over independently from
the<00:01:08.619> team<00:01:08.890> nine<00:01:09.070> and<00:01:09.460> we<00:01:09.790> have<00:01:09.820> a<00:01:09.970> lot<00:01:10.119> more

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:10.149 
the team nine and we have a lot more

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:12.270 
the team nine and we have a lot more
input<00:01:10.690> into<00:01:10.869> the<00:01:11.170> software<00:01:11.500> changes<00:01:12.070> and

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
input into the software changes and

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.770 
input into the software changes and
we're<00:01:12.700> making<00:01:12.940> big<00:01:13.119> strides<00:01:13.300> in<00:01:13.659> that

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
we're making big strides in that

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.570 
we're making big strides in that
direction<00:01:13.960> we're<00:01:14.590> trying<00:01:14.830> to<00:01:15.009> with<00:01:15.310> the<00:01:15.430> new

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
direction we're trying to with the new

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.609 
direction we're trying to with the new
rules<00:01:15.790> continue<00:01:16.390> also<00:01:16.690> with<00:01:16.869> engine

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
rules continue also with engine

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.560 
rules continue also with engine
development<00:01:18.159> to<00:01:18.399> actually<00:01:18.700> make<00:01:18.880> a<00:01:18.909> forward

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
development to actually make a forward

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.289 
development to actually make a forward
step<00:01:19.810> as<00:01:20.110> opposed<00:01:20.440> to<00:01:20.590> coming<00:01:21.580> backwards<00:01:22.180> with

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
step as opposed to coming backwards with

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:25.290 
step as opposed to coming backwards with
the<00:01:22.330> rules<00:01:22.659> and<00:01:23.640> overall<00:01:24.640> trying<00:01:24.940> to<00:01:25.030> refine

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
the rules and overall trying to refine

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.870 
the rules and overall trying to refine
the<00:01:25.479> package<00:01:25.840> of<00:01:25.960> the<00:01:26.050> zubr<00:01:26.500> I<00:01:26.530> feel<00:01:26.920> like<00:01:27.070> we

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
the package of the zubr I feel like we

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.609 
the package of the zubr I feel like we
haven't<00:01:28.060> got<00:01:28.420> the<00:01:28.600> best<00:01:28.780> out<00:01:29.050> of<00:01:29.080> the<00:01:29.259> package

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
haven't got the best out of the package

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.400 
haven't got the best out of the package
in<00:01:29.770> the<00:01:29.800> past<00:01:30.070> and<00:01:30.720> that's<00:01:31.720> definitely<00:01:31.990> the

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
in the past and that's definitely the

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.430 
in the past and that's definitely the
target<00:01:33.039> precision<00:01:33.899> so<00:01:34.899> there's<00:01:35.080> winter<00:01:35.259> we

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
target precision so there's winter we

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.560 
target precision so there's winter we
make<00:01:35.619> a<00:01:35.649> big<00:01:36.039> progress<00:01:36.280> with<00:01:36.729> the<00:01:36.820> bikes<00:01:37.030> I

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
make a big progress with the bikes I

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.410 
make a big progress with the bikes I
think<00:01:38.289> we<00:01:38.380> can<00:01:38.560> we<00:01:39.250> make<00:01:39.490> a<00:01:39.520> big<00:01:40.000> step<00:01:40.179> next

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
think we can we make a big step next

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.270 
think we can we make a big step next
year<00:01:40.630> because<00:01:40.899> yeah<00:01:41.530> we<00:01:41.590> already<00:01:41.860> one<00:01:42.250> step

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
year because yeah we already one step

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.830 
year because yeah we already one step
ahead<00:01:42.580> and<00:01:42.759> I<00:01:43.179> really<00:01:43.929> prefer

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.140 

sure<00:01:48.870> I'm<00:01:49.290> improved<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.100> also<00:01:50.550> during<00:01:51.030> the

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
sure I'm improved and also during the

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.950 
sure I'm improved and also during the
winter<00:01:51.840> test<00:01:52.110> work<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:53.130> lot<00:01:53.610> on<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.750> team

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
winter test work a lot on the the team

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.140 
winter test work a lot on the the team
for<00:01:55.620> improve<00:01:55.980> the<00:01:56.070> bike<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.550> this<00:01:57.540> is<00:01:59.150> an

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
for improve the bike and this is an

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.650 
for improve the bike and this is an
electronic<00:02:00.900> system<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.730> that's<00:02:02.730> the<00:02:03.270> way<00:02:03.480> it

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
electronic system and that's the way it

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.520 
electronic system and that's the way it
was<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:04.320> good<00:02:04.560> way<00:02:04.710> for<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.820> season<00:02:06.140> yet<00:02:07.140> repair

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
was a good way for the season yet repair

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.590 
was a good way for the season yet repair
