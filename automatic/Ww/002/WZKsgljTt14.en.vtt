00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:07.630 
in a previous episode we realized that

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.440 
in a previous episode we realized that
there<00:00:07.990> were<00:00:08.170> two<00:00:08.469> types<00:00:08.500> of<00:00:08.980> tobots<00:00:09.459> this

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:10.450 
there were two types of tobots this

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.250 
there were two types of tobots this
class<00:00:10.750> 1<00:00:11.049> and<00:00:11.320> class<00:00:11.350> 2<00:00:12.299> now<00:00:13.299> class<00:00:13.629> 1<00:00:14.020> is

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:14.260 
class 1 and class 2 now class 1 is

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:15.959 
class 1 and class 2 now class 1 is
generally<00:00:14.740> identified<00:00:14.980> by<00:00:15.520> the<00:00:15.580> fact<00:00:15.910> that

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:15.969 
generally identified by the fact that

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:18.480

vehicle what the class 2 bar also does

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.329 
vehicle what the class 2 bar also does
is<00:00:40.089> allow<00:00:40.659> for<00:00:40.690> the<00:00:41.050> fitment<00:00:41.499> of<00:00:41.649> a<00:00:42.069> weight

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:42.339

is allow for the fitment of a weight
distribution<00:00:42.789> hitch<00:00:43.350> what<00:00:44.350> that<00:00:44.559> does<00:00:44.859> is

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
distribution hitch what that does is

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.829 
distribution hitch what that does is
take<00:00:45.550> some<00:00:45.789> of<00:00:45.819> the<00:00:45.999> weight<00:00:46.120> off<00:00:46.300> the<00:00:46.479> front<00:00:46.749> of

start off parallel with the back of the

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.800 
start off parallel with the back of the
car<00:01:05.199> into<00:01:05.979> the<00:01:06.070> eyelet<00:01:06.520> into<00:01:07.090> the<00:01:07.240> sleeve<00:01:07.540> and

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
car into the eyelet into the sleeve and

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.590 
car into the eyelet into the sleeve and
then<00:01:08.200> bring<00:01:08.440> your<00:01:08.470> chain<00:01:08.890> around<00:01:09.280> so<00:01:10.210> that<00:01:10.240> one

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
then bring your chain around so that one

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.420 
then bring your chain around so that one
of<00:01:10.719> the<00:01:10.810> eyelets<00:01:11.229> is<00:01:11.439> going<00:01:11.890> to<00:01:11.979> go<00:01:12.070> up<00:01:12.250> over

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
of the eyelets is going to go up over

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.969 
of the eyelets is going to go up over
the<00:01:12.670> hook<00:01:12.939> onto<00:01:13.270> your<00:01:13.899> lifter<00:01:14.229> take<00:01:14.710> a<00:01:14.740> bit<00:01:14.890> of

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
the hook onto your lifter take a bit of

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.340 
the hook onto your lifter take a bit of
the<00:01:15.070> strain<00:01:15.369> up<00:01:15.549> and<00:01:15.759> then<00:01:16.149> with<00:01:16.360> your<00:01:16.570> bar<00:01:17.140> to

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
the strain up and then with your bar to

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.590 
the strain up and then with your bar to
give<00:01:17.500> you<00:01:17.590> more<00:01:17.799> leverage<00:01:18.070> the<00:01:18.490> handle<00:01:18.969> brings

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
give you more leverage the handle brings

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.469 
give you more leverage the handle brings
it<00:01:19.750> up<00:01:19.840> the<00:01:20.740> pin<00:01:21.310> will<00:01:21.700> go<00:01:21.880> in<00:01:22.060> from<00:01:22.299> the<00:01:22.450> front

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
it up the pin will go in from the front

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.440 
it up the pin will go in from the front
not<00:01:23.320> from<00:01:23.560> the<00:01:23.680> back<00:01:23.890> and<00:01:24.130> slide<00:01:24.609> through<00:01:25.149> and

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
not from the back and slide through and

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.020 
not from the back and slide through and
then<00:01:25.930> take<00:01:26.200> your<00:01:26.350> handle<00:01:26.649> away<00:01:26.920> we're<00:01:27.909> going

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
then take your handle away we're going

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.940 
then take your handle away we're going
to<00:01:28.090> take<00:01:28.270> the<00:01:28.420> jockey<00:01:28.659> wheel<00:01:28.960> out<00:01:29.140> and<00:01:29.439> do<00:01:29.829> the

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
to take the jockey wheel out and do the

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.130 
to take the jockey wheel out and do the
other<00:01:29.979> side

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
other side

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.370 
other side
okay<00:01:32.140> so<00:01:32.920> jockey<00:01:33.520> wheel<00:01:33.789> comes<00:01:34.420> out<00:01:34.659> place

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
okay so jockey wheel comes out place

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.830 
okay so jockey wheel comes out place
English<00:01:36.039> side<00:01:36.369> we'll<00:01:37.090> just<00:01:37.270> put<00:01:37.420> the<00:01:37.509> clamp

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
English side we'll just put the clamp

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.289 
English side we'll just put the clamp
back<00:01:38.109> in<00:01:38.679> make<00:01:39.429> sure<00:01:39.460> it's<00:01:39.789> nice<00:01:39.939> and<00:01:40.000> secure

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
back in make sure it's nice and secure

back in make sure it's nice and secure
the<00:01:40.990> wheel<00:01:41.170> has<00:01:41.380> to<00:01:41.500> come<00:01:41.710> off<00:01:41.859> because<00:01:42.039> this

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
the wheel has to come off because this

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.550 
the wheel has to come off because this
bar<00:01:42.729> won't<00:01:43.000> fit<00:01:43.390> in<00:01:43.539> while<00:01:43.840> the<00:01:44.020> wheels<00:01:44.259> in
