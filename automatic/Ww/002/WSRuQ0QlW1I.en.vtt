through<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.710> features<00:00:16.920> of<00:00:17.190> this<00:00:18.029> tripod<00:00:18.539> head

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
through the features of this tripod head

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:29.880 
through the features of this tripod head
today<00:00:19.020> using<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.619> Manfrotto<00:00:20.660> 322<00:00:21.800> rc2

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.400 

now<00:00:30.670> they've<00:00:31.180> got<00:00:31.330> a<00:00:31.360> couple<00:00:31.539> of<00:00:31.780> these<00:00:31.960> models

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
now they've got a couple of these models

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.120 
now they've got a couple of these models
that<00:00:32.650> like<00:00:33.220> a<00:00:33.250> pistol<00:00:33.760> group<00:00:34.380> this<00:00:35.380> is<00:00:35.440> my

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:36.130 
that like a pistol group this is my

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.740 
that like a pistol group this is my
favorite<00:00:36.580> I<00:00:36.670> went<00:00:36.850> and<00:00:36.910> tested<00:00:37.300> them<00:00:37.420> all<00:00:37.540> out

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
favorite I went and tested them all out

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.900 
favorite I went and tested them all out
I<00:00:37.780> suggest<00:00:38.080> you<00:00:38.440> do<00:00:38.590> too<00:00:38.890> it's<00:00:39.489> got<00:00:39.730> a

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
I suggest you do too it's got a

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.700 
I suggest you do too it's got a
surprising<00:00:40.360> amount<00:00:40.570> of<00:00:40.809> weight<00:00:41.080> in<00:00:41.290> it<00:00:41.440> for

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
surprising amount of weight in it for

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.470 
surprising amount of weight in it for
quite<00:00:42.100> a<00:00:42.130> small<00:00:42.460> head<00:00:42.760> this<00:00:43.000> whole<00:00:43.239> ball

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
quite a small head this whole ball

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.950 
quite a small head this whole ball
section<00:00:43.989> here<00:00:44.379> is<00:00:44.860> all<00:00:45.190> metal<00:00:45.580> which<00:00:46.480> is<00:00:46.690> great

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
section here is all metal which is great

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.869 
section here is all metal which is great
and<00:00:47.199> when<00:00:47.739> you're<00:00:47.860> using<00:00:48.070> a<00:00:48.280> light<00:00:48.460> tripod

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
and when you're using a light tripod

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:50.580 
and when you're using a light tripod
like<00:00:49.059> mine<00:00:49.300> this<00:00:49.570> is<00:00:49.750> a<00:00:49.780> carbon<00:00:50.350> fiber

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
like mine this is a carbon fiber

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.040 
like mine this is a carbon fiber
Manfrotto<00:00:51.370> it<00:00:51.850> adds<00:00:52.120> a<00:00:52.420> good<00:00:52.629> amount<00:00:52.870> of

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
Manfrotto it adds a good amount of

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.170 
Manfrotto it adds a good amount of
weight<00:00:53.230> you<00:00:54.160> know<00:00:54.309> in<00:00:54.430> your<00:00:54.550> body<00:00:54.790> center<00:00:55.120> of

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
weight you know in your body center of

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.479 
weight you know in your body center of
gravity<00:00:55.600> all<00:00:55.690> around<00:00:55.989> the<00:00:56.110> camera<00:00:56.530> I<00:00:56.769> find<00:00:57.340> it

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
gravity all around the camera I find it

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.560 
gravity all around the camera I find it
really<00:00:58.000> good<00:00:59.460> so<00:01:00.460> main<00:01:00.670> features<00:01:01.180> on<00:01:01.449> the

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
really good so main features on the

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.119 
really good so main features on the
front<00:01:01.809> here<00:01:01.989> you've<00:01:02.170> got<00:01:02.409> a<00:01:02.440> dial<00:01:02.860> that<00:01:03.010> you

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
front here you've got a dial that you

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:04.950 
front here you've got a dial that you
can<00:01:03.339> adjust<00:01:03.460> the<00:01:03.850> friction<00:01:04.299> which<00:01:04.449> is<00:01:04.659> how

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
can adjust the friction which is how

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.750 
can adjust the friction which is how
hard<00:01:05.229> it's<00:01:05.409> going<00:01:05.530> to<00:01:05.590> be<00:01:05.650> for<00:01:06.010> you<00:01:06.130> to<00:01:06.310> move<00:01:06.549> it

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
hard it's going to be for you to move it

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.330 
hard it's going to be for you to move it
around<00:01:06.850> and<00:01:07.299> then<00:01:07.810> once<00:01:08.020> it's<00:01:08.229> locked<00:01:08.380> how

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
around and then once it's locked how

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.510 
around and then once it's locked how
much<00:01:09.520> pressure<00:01:09.790> it<00:01:09.970> takes<00:01:10.210> to<00:01:10.420> move<00:01:10.570> it<00:01:11.370> for<00:01:12.370> me

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
much pressure it takes to move it for me

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.060 
much pressure it takes to move it for me
I<00:01:12.850> was<00:01:13.150> a<00:01:13.180> little<00:01:13.450> bit<00:01:13.540> worried<00:01:13.870> about<00:01:14.140> the

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
I was a little bit worried about the

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.340 
I was a little bit worried about the
fine<00:01:15.340> precision<00:01:16.000> control<00:01:16.600> you'd<00:01:16.780> have<00:01:17.020> using

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
fine precision control you'd have using

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.060 
fine precision control you'd have using
a<00:01:17.440> tripod<00:01:17.650> like<00:01:18.580> this<00:01:18.820> instead<00:01:19.210> of<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:21.040> know

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
a tripod like this instead of you know

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.410 
a tripod like this instead of you know
one<00:01:21.340> of<00:01:21.369> the<00:01:21.520> ones<00:01:21.700> that<00:01:21.820> have<00:01:22.090> a<00:01:22.119> lot<00:01:22.299> of

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
one of the ones that have a lot of

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.810 
one of the ones that have a lot of
adjustment<00:01:22.900> features<00:01:23.320> it's<00:01:24.190> not<00:01:24.430> a<00:01:24.460> big<00:01:24.640> issue

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
adjustment features it's not a big issue

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.399 
adjustment features it's not a big issue
for<00:01:25.090> me<00:01:25.150> maybe<00:01:25.570> if<00:01:25.750> you're<00:01:25.900> doing<00:01:26.110> half<00:01:26.290> a

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
for me maybe if you're doing half a

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:27.810 
for me maybe if you're doing half a
texture<00:01:26.799> or<00:01:26.860> some<00:01:27.159> other<00:01:27.340> forms<00:01:27.729> of

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
texture or some other forms of

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.090 
texture or some other forms of
photography<00:01:28.420> but<00:01:28.630> for<00:01:28.810> me<00:01:28.960> I<00:01:29.200> get<00:01:29.860> it<00:01:29.890> in

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
photography but for me I get it in

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.270 
photography but for me I get it in
position<00:01:30.250> my<00:01:30.820> d3s<00:01:31.450> has<00:01:31.780> a<00:01:31.960> virtual<00:01:32.260> horizon<00:01:33.159> I

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
position my d3s has a virtual horizon I

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.400 
position my d3s has a virtual horizon I
can<00:01:33.490> work<00:01:33.610> out<00:01:33.790> what<00:01:33.970> angle<00:01:34.330> I<00:01:34.390> need<00:01:34.630> let<00:01:35.230> go

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
can work out what angle I need let go

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
can work out what angle I need let go
and<00:01:35.680> it's<00:01:35.860> locked

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
and it's locked

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.880 
and it's locked
it<00:01:36.760> really<00:01:37.120> isn't<00:01:37.330> going<00:01:37.540> to<00:01:37.660> move<00:01:37.890> what's

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
it really isn't going to move what's

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.500 
it really isn't going to move what's
more<00:01:39.100> likely<00:01:39.310> is<00:01:39.520> you'll<00:01:39.760> kick<00:01:40.150> your<00:01:40.270> tripod

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
more likely is you'll kick your tripod

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.660 
more likely is you'll kick your tripod
over<00:01:40.750> or<00:01:41.260> not<00:01:41.560> tighten<00:01:41.950> one<00:01:42.040> of<00:01:42.190> these<00:01:42.340> and

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
over or not tighten one of these and

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.280 
over or not tighten one of these and
then<00:01:42.760> it<00:01:42.910> can<00:01:43.060> rotate<00:01:43.270> this<00:01:43.600> way<00:01:43.810> or<00:01:44.080> something

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
then it can rotate this way or something

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.660 
then it can rotate this way or something
like<00:01:44.560> that<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:46.060> can<00:01:46.240> also<00:01:46.510> take<00:01:47.020> this<00:01:47.670> plate

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
like that you can also take this plate

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.850 
like that you can also take this plate
off<00:01:48.910> and<00:01:49.180> connect<00:01:49.960> it<00:01:50.110> up<00:01:50.200> here<00:01:50.470> so<00:01:50.680> if<00:01:50.770> you

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
off and connect it up here so if you

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.320 
off and connect it up here so if you
need<00:01:51.010> a<00:01:51.040> little<00:01:51.220> bit<00:01:51.400> of<00:01:51.490> extra<00:01:51.700> height<00:01:51.970> or<00:01:52.240> it

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
need a little bit of extra height or it

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.820 
need a little bit of extra height or it
just<00:01:52.510> works<00:01:52.720> better<00:01:52.960> for<00:01:53.050> you<00:01:53.380> to<00:01:53.530> be<00:01:53.560> gripping

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
just works better for you to be gripping

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.040 
just works better for you to be gripping
it<00:01:54.010> that<00:01:54.190> way<00:01:54.340> instead<00:01:54.520> of<00:01:54.700> that<00:01:54.820> way<00:01:54.970> this<00:01:55.750> can

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
it that way instead of that way this can

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.210 
it that way instead of that way this can
go<00:01:56.080> up<00:01:56.350> here<00:01:56.590> and<00:01:56.620> then<00:01:56.920> you<00:01:56.980> can<00:01:57.100> you

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
go up here and then you can you

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.040 
go up here and then you can you
quick-release<00:01:57.580> plate<00:01:57.730> on<00:01:58.180> and<00:01:58.420> your<00:01:58.810> camera

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
quick-release plate on and your camera
