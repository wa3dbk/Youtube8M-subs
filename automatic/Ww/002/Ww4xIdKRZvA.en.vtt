 brings another extensible of 32 extendable 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.620
 because you have to cut it 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.630

 circle of the center will mark the time and 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:52.210
 the outer circle these minutes 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:54.490

 200 dollars 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.260
 if it's a bit high 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.410
 because at first it did not come out that expensive 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.080

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.090
