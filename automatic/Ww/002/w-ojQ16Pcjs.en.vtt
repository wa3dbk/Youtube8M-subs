00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.679
 today's video I do not bring a criticism nor 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.450
 a news what I have for today is a 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.210
 ranking with the characters and elements 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:19.050
 of ironman that have never been adapted 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.449
 to the cinema let's start with this ranking in 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.150
 the number 10 we have the villain 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.039
 whirlwind this ironman enemy that 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.810
 has the ability to turn a 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.240
 great speed that allows you to create 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.610
 great gusts of winds and as well as 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.070
 throwing shurikens from his armor is 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.530
 one of ironman's classic enemies 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.780
 has had an appearance in the series of 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.629
 television in addition to being a member of 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.850
 masters of evil the greatest complication of 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.460
 this character to be adapted would be 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.829
 explain the origin of their powers since 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.780
 this character is a mutant and as 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.410
 We know everything about the world 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.690
 marvel mutant belongs to lux in the 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.510
 put number 9 we find madame 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.699
 mask alter ego by witney frost when dying 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.680
 her father discovered that she was the daughter of a 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.210
 powerful leader of the mafia called 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.700
 Faria condemned 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.830
 the training even came to take its 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.930
 place but during one of his jobs 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.330
 with his men he finished with his face 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.190
 deformed moment at which you receive a 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.860
 golden mask from mordecai 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.890
 lives adopting the identity of madame 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.900
 more has been thought of adapting this 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.930
 character but it would have been another merger 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.720
 of characters his appearance would have been 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.750
 in iron man 3 being the alter ego that 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.690
 I would have given him maya hansen in the place 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.729
 number 8 is for the living laser this 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.429
 intellectual expert in technology at 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.860
 do your physical body was replaced 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:46.289
 by guanta photons with skills like 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.600
 shoot energy rays project 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:51.050
 holographic images travel to the 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.270
 speed of light among others 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.120
 has allied with different villains 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.610
 like the mandarin and the reaper I do not see him 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.740
 many possibilities to this character in 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.750
 the cinema mainly because the 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.870
 concept is very similar to electro 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:09.500
 villain of spider-man on the rung 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:12.770
 number 7 we find so son stein 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.530
 by badaia stein alias iron villain woman 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.780
 of the first movie this character 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.180
 which has a similar intelligence 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.060
 to Tony Stark with whom he tends to 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.740
 compare to get over it he 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.110
 characterized by modifying 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.810
 inventions of stark industries for 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.000
 make improvements in your own body of 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.920
 moment has only had an appearance in a 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.900
 animated movie and not being a 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.420
 Character well known to the public 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.819
 general it is complicated to appear in 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.579
 a movie 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:45.069
 arriving at position 6 we find ourselves with 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:47.139
 the ghost has a suit that gives 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.659
 the skills of invisibility and the 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:51.790
 intangibility although it is an enemy of 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:54.129
 capitalism attacking organizations 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.409
 that he considers corrupt has also 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:58.739
 worked as a mercenary for certain 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:01.659
 companies sabotaging the competition 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.549
 this character was close to reaching the 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:06.129
 cinema since at the beginning of the 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.139
 preproduction of ironman 3 was rumored 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:10.769
 that would be the villain of the tape since 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:13.810
 He was a character of the director's taste 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:16.629
 already in the middle of the ranking the place 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.299
 number 5 is to discover the alter ego 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:21.459
 of pepper potts in the armor comics 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.620
 which is designed exclusively for 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.590
 rescue operations more than for 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.319
 the battles are unlikely to see 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.510
 to this character in the cinema being the 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:34.180
 closest to what seen in ironman 3 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.269
 where toni orders his armor marc 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.040
 42 protect pepper plus you have to 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.850
 consider whitney paltrow already 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.670
 finalized his contract with marvel 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.340
 Following with our ranking we arrived 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.160
 to number 4 where we find titan and 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.230
 a bad character in an armor 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.720
 similar to iron man but with 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.570
 much more powerful weaponry besides 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.000
 be superior in various physical strength 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.490
 characters have worn this suit being 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.340
 the best known boris bulls that member 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.680
 from the street of this ironman enemy 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.050
 has only had brief participations in 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.910
 the television series but no doubt 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:15.360
 he has always been one of the adversaries 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:17.910
 most fearsome of Tony Stark now 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.700
 reaching the podium the bronze belongs to 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:23.040
 so the leader of mechanical ideas 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:26.310
 advanced one of the classic enemies 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.770
 from iron man and the captain america mode 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.230
 who adopted his current appearance after 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.540
 various experiments on his person that 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.330
 caused his body to atrophy and his 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.430
 brain grows and evolve to enigma 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.030
 he worked mainly studying the 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.460
 operation of the cosmic cube 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.770
 it has been rumored a lot with this character 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.050
 in the world of cinema being one of the 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.510
 villains that sounded louder for 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.990
 the sequel clear that captain america 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:56.450
 this only ended in a rumor the silver and 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.430
 the second place in the ranking is for 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.680
 fun full this fearsome villain 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.470
 coming from space is one of the 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.330
 most fearsome enemies of ironman too 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.300
 is who gives the rings to the 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.610
 mandarin in the comics no doubt one of 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.470
 the most difficult enemies to whom 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.420
 has faced the iron man to 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:17.240
 point of having to ally with the 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:19.130
 Mandarin to be able to beat him for the moment 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.410
 only one concept of the 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.510
 character during one of the scenes of 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.640
 the first movie 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:28.820
 finally the very first first place 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:31.430
 it's for the armor hold booster 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.350
 it's not a character many are the fans 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.990
 who already want to see one of the armors 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:38.300
 most famous of Tony Stark while not 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.240
 he was present neither in the avengers nor 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.800
 in the third installment of the saga 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.980
 armor created to deal with 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.970
 hulk or enemies of similar 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.289
 features where it requires the 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.569
 hand- to-hand combat 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:52.819
 there is still possibility of his 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:56.089
 appearance considering that there are still 

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:58.550
 two movies of the avengers this has 

00:05:56.089 --> 00:06:00.740
 been all for today for the next video 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.889
 I will bring the second part of the futures 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.930
 marvel and dc comics projects too 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:09.229
 can make their recommendations for 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:11.599
