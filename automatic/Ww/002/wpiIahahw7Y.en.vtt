darkbeast<00:00:45.829> that<00:00:46.460> we<00:00:46.700> know<00:00:46.820> we<00:00:46.940> can<00:00:47.090> increase

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
darkbeast that we know we can increase

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.330 
darkbeast that we know we can increase
them<00:00:47.630> out<00:00:47.780> of<00:00:47.809> them<00:00:48.020> so<00:00:48.559> basically<00:00:48.860> instead<00:00:49.160> of

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
them out of them so basically instead of

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.709 
them out of them so basically instead of
just<00:00:49.460> increasing<00:00:50.120> it<00:00:50.210> yeah<00:00:50.390> it's<00:00:50.510> kind<00:00:50.690> of

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
just increasing it yeah it's kind of

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:52.120 
just increasing it yeah it's kind of
like<00:00:50.809> spensive<00:00:51.230> Slayer<00:00:51.410> boynes<00:00:51.649> on<00:00:51.829> it<00:00:51.980> I

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.130 
like spensive Slayer boynes on it I

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.040 
like spensive Slayer boynes on it I
think<00:00:52.399> it's<00:00:52.489> like<00:00:52.610> 125<00:00:53.210> Slayer<00:00:53.570> points<00:00:53.870> not

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
think it's like 125 Slayer points not

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.479 
think it's like 125 Slayer points not

yeah that's been added as well things

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.940 
yeah that's been added as well things
like<00:00:59.719> gargoyles<00:01:00.170> you<00:01:00.530> don't<00:01:00.680> have<00:01:00.770> to<00:01:00.829> use<00:01:00.920> a

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:00.950 
like gargoyles you don't have to use a

like gargoyles you don't have to use a
rock<00:01:01.190> camera<00:01:01.579> initially<00:01:02.210> on<00:01:02.390> it<00:01:02.600> but<00:01:03.230> I

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
rock camera initially on it but I

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.389 
rock camera initially on it but I
believe<00:01:03.469> you<00:01:03.620> do<00:01:03.739> need<00:01:03.890> to<00:01:03.920> have<00:01:04.100> it<00:01:04.219> in<00:01:04.280> your

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:04.399 
believe you do need to have it in your

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:05.770 
believe you do need to have it in your
inventory<00:01:04.820> that's<00:01:05.030> how<00:01:05.149> it<00:01:05.269> is<00:01:05.390> on<00:01:05.479> you'll<00:01:05.720> see

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
inventory that's how it is on you'll see

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.140 
inventory that's how it is on you'll see
as<00:01:06.020> well<00:01:06.200> so<00:01:06.530> I<00:01:06.740> would<00:01:07.250> hide<00:01:07.430> out<00:01:07.820> that<00:01:08.030> it's

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
as well so I would hide out that it's

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.240 
as well so I would hide out that it's
not<00:01:08.270> like<00:01:08.780> that<00:01:08.930> no<00:01:09.080> 7<00:01:09.440> that's<00:01:09.830> gotta<00:01:10.040> be<00:01:10.070> the

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
not like that no 7 that's gotta be the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.590 
not like that no 7 that's gotta be the
worst<00:01:10.280> part<00:01:10.820> about<00:01:10.850> that<00:01:11.090> task<00:01:11.330> that<00:01:11.540> i

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
worst part about that task that i

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.300 
worst part about that task that i
sometimes<00:01:12.020> hate<00:01:12.409> that<00:01:12.619> task<00:01:12.860> is<00:01:13.070> you<00:01:13.159> gotta

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
sometimes hate that task is you gotta

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.039 
sometimes hate that task is you gotta
always<00:01:13.369> use<00:01:13.760> a<00:01:13.790> rock<00:01:14.060> camera<00:01:14.420> it's<00:01:14.840> kind<00:01:15.020> of

always use a rock camera it's kind of

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:17.140 
always use a rock camera it's kind of
dangerous<00:01:15.200> too<00:01:15.560> because<00:01:15.740> if<00:01:15.860> UDC<00:01:16.159> you<00:01:17.000> could

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.610 
anyways it's a little bit off topic i
guess<00:04:05.000> i<00:04:05.120> would<00:04:05.510> assume<00:04:05.690> so<00:04:05.900> my<00:04:06.170> dad's<00:04:06.380> in<00:04:06.500> the

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
guess i would assume so my dad's in the

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.170

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.520 
the last batch will probably be the the

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.340

well<00:04:51.440> I<00:04:51.710> would<00:04:51.980> assume<00:04:52.100> with<00:04:52.430> something<00:04:52.700> like

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
well I would assume with something like

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.510 
well I would assume with something like
a<00:04:52.850> hundred<00:04:53.090> like<00:04:53.420> 150<00:04:54.170> um<00:04:54.320> but<00:04:55.190> I<00:04:55.280> gotta<00:04:55.460> say

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
a hundred like 150 um but I gotta say

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.100 
a hundred like 150 um but I gotta say
that<00:04:56.000> might<00:04:56.120> be<00:04:56.270> a<00:04:56.300> little<00:04:56.450> bit<00:04:56.630> tricky<00:04:56.870> to<00:04:56.930> do

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
that might be a little bit tricky to do

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.250 
that might be a little bit tricky to do
107<00:04:57.650> because<00:04:57.980> they<00:04:58.760> do<00:04:58.820> made<00:04:59.210> you<00:04:59.450> and<00:04:59.750> which

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
107 because they do made you and which

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.720 
107 because they do made you and which
means<00:05:00.530> you<00:05:00.590> have<00:05:00.770> to<00:05:00.800> bring<00:05:01.040> guns<00:05:01.250> but<00:05:01.610> it's

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 
means you have to bring guns but it's

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.340 
means you have to bring guns but it's
not<00:05:01.880> worth<00:05:02.060> being<00:05:02.210> agustín's<00:05:02.750> because<00:05:03.230> they

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
not worth being agustín's because they

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:04.990 
not worth being agustín's because they
do<00:05:03.470> drop<00:05:03.680> sharks<00:05:04.130> and<00:05:04.400> you<00:05:04.490> guys<00:05:04.580> who<00:05:04.730> got<00:05:04.820> pick
