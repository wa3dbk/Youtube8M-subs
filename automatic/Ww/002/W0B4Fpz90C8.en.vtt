00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.600
 all the best time of the day with you 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.510
 mountain again night and today we are with you 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.660
 let's continue to fantasize about the game witcher 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.430
 3 wild hunt 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.460
 First, let's explain why I 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.370
 I consider the most preferred move 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.860
 events well and also their likely more likely 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.350
 total result which I described in 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.940
 the first part 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:00.700
 I remind you that at the end of the second part of the game 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:02.000
 yorvet triss merigold was chosen 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.540
 saved 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.080
 cold dancing ramil killed the princesses 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:12.259
 tennis survived 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:17.270
 dragon nipples were not killed and more than once 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:20.030
 conjured and so at last games witcher 2 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.399
 the killer of kings the situation was 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.600
 next in progress 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:29.780
 conspiracy nilfgardtsev counterintelligence 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:33.229
 parts of the sorceresses from the lodge and the slaughter team 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:36.229
 Witcher summer the northern kingdoms were 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:39.620
 plunged into the abyss of chaos which with 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.690
 barely managed to prevent the result 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.360
 conspiracy was the death of two monks 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:49.520
 the largest kingdoms and tati measure and and 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:51.080
 aeterna also at the cost of our efforts with you 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.340
 partially managed to stabilize 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.770
 the situation 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:02:01.250
 Well, the alignment on the political map of the world 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:05.450
 became such now and was divided between 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.100
 kingdoms giving to edwin in 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.100
 nipple victory results 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.739
 top of my Bernie Panther Valley 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.450
 came under the control of elves and red 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.489
 love 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.910
 however the rest of the kingdom 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:24.920
 left under control following dima 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.370
 windom king stannis 17 so here 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.350
 we have 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:31.070
 some sort of stable 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:34.579
 only one statehood is bad 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:37.250
 King Nilfgard Amber Pain Chemist That 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:38.570
 his advisors decided what up 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.580
 at the moment the most that neither is 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.360
 favorable to take 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.790
 revenge for defeat under the mortal 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.920
 in some way they are right like this 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.030
 the moment of the northern kingdom reminds 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:55.430
 you big blanket and agreement between 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.400
 the rulers are actually you by the way 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.370
 something like the ancient Russia you 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.430
 remember a bunch of such small principalities they 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.020
 there were squabbling among themselves 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:11.690
 despite resistance for three hundred years 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:12.950
 fell under the yoke as we probably 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.650
 We will assume that the main task 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.410
 Geralt in the third part of the game will be 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.080
 Association of the Northern Realms purpose 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.380
 fight back imperial troops miles in 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.380
 guard 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.730
 now let's compare combat 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.230
 component of the northern kingdoms and 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.480
 empire nilfgaard 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:38.120
 so at first, probably all the same do not like 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.320
 what we have here is well trained and 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.410
 armed and 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.310
 imperial troops of iron discipline you 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.580
 composition books 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:51.340
 the first is the formation of a regular 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:54.620
 heavy cavalry the second is hard 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:58.070
 armed armored infantry which 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.200
 Again, regular and 3 as troops 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:03.650
 support the detachments of crossbowmen 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:08.480
 and engineering corps with siege weapons 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:11.390
 but with the magicians of the Persians are not a lot of those of 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.269
 you who read the saga of pan sapkovsky in 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:17.500
 course but those who have not read 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.500
 Now I will briefly explain why 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:24.320
 emperor engr 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:26.200
 in childhood as a result of conspiracy 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.340
 subject to magical effects 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:32.680
 impact was forced to leave 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:35.259
 I will explain the empire now why 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.820
 because of this very spell by day it 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:39.460
 face 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.979
 was a stubby mask 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:46.289
 because of this he got his nickname 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:51.669
 eat and only after midnight to him 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:54.400
 the human face returned however 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:57.220
 from the saga not without the help of the heralt spells 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:00.070
 it was finally filmed after some 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.870
 time he returned to her in r in 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:05.139
 details it will not go this 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:07.570
 too long and difficult and here rather 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:09.789
 That’s why Ingar doesn’t feed 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.340
 tenderness to magicians though some 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:17.729
 the number of warlocks his disposal all 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:19.900
 so there is so with nilfgard until all 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:25.060
 let's now about the warriors of the north 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:27.970
 kingdoms first cavalry here we are 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:31.620
 we probably have knightly 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:35.289
 the formation of which will have to create 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:39.070
 some kind of organized drums 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:43.389
 groups the second is with us kolchuzhny 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:45.690
 infantry city guards and rather 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:45.690
 Total 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:52.580
 city ​​police understand that this 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.140
 not like nilfgardtsev 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:58.250
 again with certain 

00:05:54.140 --> 00:06:00.050
 circumstances really carbon monoxide 3 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.210
 Well, from support troops 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:06.620
 a number of crossbowmen 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:08.960
 Of course there is but most easy 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.300
 armed pernikov make up rather 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.940
 all archers and as you understand 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:18.440
 bow crossbow better just to remember 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:20.480
 the battle of poitiers and plus to all this 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.460
 let's go all the same in composition and 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.220
 the number of troops of the northern kingdoms 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:28.130
 relative to their territories about magicians we 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:31.310
 already a little later let's talk 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:34.460
 Royal Kingdom of Denmark 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:36.080
 and knight troops prius armor 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:39.650
 flaming rose organs 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:44.030
 so not bad power so kingdom to 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:46.250
 edwin battered in the battle for the cores on 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:49.130
 royal knight troops more 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:50.920
 like I don't know anything about them 

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:53.600
 kingdoms of temeria 

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:56.090
 the troops are almost perfectly fine but with 

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.790
 considering the composition of the kingdom itself 

00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:03.050
 losing overlord and well talk about either 

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:05.870
 their combat effectiveness is still early kingdom 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:08.360
 only troops will speak 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:11.570
 quite difficult as the information of them 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:16.460
 almost not so let's hope for 

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:20.840
 mobilization so the top of the nuclei is not yet 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:23.020
 kingdom but this is the part of the territory 

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:27.460
 which is controlled by the nipples 

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:30.170
 these are detachments of foot red leads and k 

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:33.230
 what is probably the most volatile 

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:37.040
 squads of archers Jörg then so but 

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:40.780
 Now at the end you still have to explain 

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:44.270
 why is my passage I saved trees 

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:46.220
 the fact is that in this case not 

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:48.620
 come full genocide magicians 

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:51.130
 sorceresses and we have in our 

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:54.390
 possessing enough weighty force 

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:57.560
 let's just remember what is perishable 

00:07:54.390 --> 00:08:02.360
 magicians of the northern kingdoms battalions 

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:07.650
 put black cloak infantry nilfgard 

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:10.020
 here so we will discuss the current something in 3 

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:13.020
 probably parts but i hope this 

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:15.600
 monologue seemed to you more than 

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:19.670
 interesting with you was gorynych 

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.670
 thanks for watching and bye
