00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:05.340
 hi everyone if I josé and today I'll pointed out how to look 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.560
 v the first and last letter 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.209
 of a deck 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:12.409
 the first method is to see the last letter 

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:17.179
 we are like this present in our game talking and suddenly we say good 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:22.230
 people think that magicians have things in the bars and letters and such the 

00:00:22.229 --> 00:00:25.369
 medal talker speaks to you in this manga the field you have in this other 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.199
 and if you notice what I've done with the indicated this tour data of this 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:30.630
 pile of letters 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.670
 has allowed me to see here add the course is always talking 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:35.750
 quickly 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.150
 people 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.640
 because of how I'm talking with the gestures usually do not realize 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.740
 It is the first metro 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.980
 the second method 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.040
 is to do like this 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.470
 thus having 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.420
 I know we have a tic the shuffled figure we are like this all the time 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.180
 we passed was playing with the cards not 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.130
 and really here 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.290
 we have seen the last letter and the first several times end 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.170
 the last g5 of hearts 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.190
 what he has done is several times this is useless 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.080
 and once this is done 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.920
 that allows you to see the latest 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.220
 people do not really know why I do these things and that just that I'm 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.220
 as showing a rare life 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.560
 to see the first letter 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.140
 located in the last row moss well 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.140
 for the first one we have like this 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.820
 Of course there is nothing to do 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.920
 ikea is to say watching half an hour but we are like this shuffling 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.230
 to a fry 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.720
 also the first 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.180
 and follow the first one distinguish between olés 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.660
 here it is 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.950
 if we want to see them 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.950
 I think it's the jota and golazos 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.430
 perfect 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.730
 position has been occupied in the last of the first deed of a deck I hope 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.980
 that you liked in that it was served 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.670
 comment civil 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:07.729
 and in many places
