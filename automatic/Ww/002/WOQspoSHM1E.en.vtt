00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.419
 not what I think 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.159
 I'm still doing research on your path 

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:29.120

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:47.939
 he escaped 

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:51.019

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:59.980
 where nothing seems like a bicycle 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.479
 the escape is the find 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:05.930
 who never really got the cesena 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.539

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.659
 60 cents 

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:13.889
 there are estimated 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:17.830
 at least for the pop world in the hospital and it doesn't get caught 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.680
