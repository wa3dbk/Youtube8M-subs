00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.570
 we really a very global 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:10.430
 important we have a very challenging 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.860
 difficult from a very complex area but 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.910
 we trust in society the team is 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.110
 is working with a lot 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:20.210
 responsibility and with the objective of 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.650
 can make the best result move to 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.689
 the second round and make a world in 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.599
 wilder his world cup is a world 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.189
 different a lot of 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.410
 situations that are not usually in 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.260
 the world championships and that makes him attractive 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.360
 more because our inclusion be 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.600
 from the nest tell you that we are 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.699
 working with a lot of responsibility 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.820
 with many decades of dedication and 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:46.550
 trying to have everything necessary as 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.739
 to make an excellent preparation in 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.260
 the course and if there is nothing left 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.579
 we are throbbing what I eat 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.850
 we started back already we are feeling it 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.829
 the world already feels a little pressure 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.750
 which is the sense of the area that we have 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.179
 so as we are closing very 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.220
 hard we say a week about you 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:06.350
 relationship has gone very hard so 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.330
 good is already coming 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.460
 and anxious also a little but the 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.369
 team the truth that at a good level 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:18.110
 that with desire to take a revenge 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:22.010
 of the World Cup in Spain and I think we are 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.330
 in good harmony with the team 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.320
 we are focusing well on defense 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.940
 we are entering well in attack 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.600
 obviously you have to polish does not make us 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.850
 enough time that we got together and good 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.940
 we now have a few days to get to 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.130
 point and get in the best way the 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.500
 first of the tournament that we do in 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.660
 france and then we put it with all 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.420
 the batteries for the world what we know 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.820
 it's going to be hard and good with that we 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.860
 We are preparing and facing 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.350
 world now with much joy with 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.950
 a lot of energy I trained very hard very 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.229
 strong but good to full the truth with 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.690
 the thought of the world and want 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.160
 leave everything you see with many chances with 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.380
 illusion of having many minutes and 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.200
 after showing you in the major if I 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.209
 personally I will leave already imagine 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.890
 as an obvious end of the truth not 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.570
 I know what a bat omar daddy says as soon as 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.540
 at the exit of migueles and the replacement 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.209
 of 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.290
 of him in terms of position but I 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.049
 I think I'll have a couple of minutes 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.180
 of the game is I hope I want that and I'm going 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:23.010
 to take advantage of blue because I know that apart 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.569
 so much to perform with the selection is a 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.189
 window to the world is an expectation 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.510
 mine that I have was a moment to go over 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:29.819
 outside and well this is a good 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.700
 opportunity to prove myself and 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.650
 obviously give the best and we know that the 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.909
 same Saudi Arabia that a lot goes away 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.569
 to swim is going to be a very 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:42.280
 hard because it came fourth Asian and it's 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.159
 the continent that the truth that is played 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.099
 a cute hanball so one will see 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:50.409
 who wins that game however and after 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:52.220
 play it in the 23 games that one 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:54.530
 feel with you want to win 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.570
 the parties that we are there are now 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.370
 missing few are the parties that 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.980
 we're going to have to leave all the meat at 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.010
 grill put everything and good you have to 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.180
 take advantage of this one day of rest and 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.640
 play in front of the matches we can not 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.720
 choose the one that has won but in the 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.190
 three that you can throw everything and good of 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.250
 be fishing to see if we take it 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.560
 something and you have to aim, I think that as 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.920
 he said at the time no denmark is a 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.410
 step above because I think that what 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.480
 logical would be to leave the group first 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.490
 poland I calculate that it will be very 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.950
 close and I think our goal is 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.800
 Germany 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.780
 and how is it called and rusia obviously 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.060
 Saudi Arabia also that is 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.970
 that a priori would be the rival for 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.900
 us to beat and then this afternoon 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.299
 win I believe them 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.220
 to russia or germany germany if it comes 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:49.829
 always from the favorites good then 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:53.250
 was out of the world losing with 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:55.739
 good poland we have to take advantage of that 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.180
 I do not think that the logical thing would be like 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.390
 he said do not say brand first or poland 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.549
 second and see what happens with 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.459
 we can steal some 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:07.349
 party more and good I have I have faith and 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.290
 I think it's going to be our hands not from 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:13.140
 get to at the decisive moments 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.480
 goal to goal and I think the pressure is going to 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.419
 play against them to be 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.940
 match with argentina and us that 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:23.430
 that we do not really like the truth that 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.310
 it's a very complicated area very 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:29.370
 complicated and we're winning what the 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:32.190
 better way training very strong and if 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.680
 I believe that step by step we are going step by step 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.820
 to go thinking match to match to see 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.620
 how the game is developing 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.930
 our what comes to us from the 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.150
 another side because konexioa here because no 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.280
 we know them very well because never never 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.689
 we play and I for my side of the truth 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.999
 what 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:51.119
 it's like I told you giving the best and 

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:55.939
 contributing my share what I can the 

00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:55.939
 team to face this matches
