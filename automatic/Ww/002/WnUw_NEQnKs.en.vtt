at here triple-a anti-aliasing and I

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.340 
at here triple-a anti-aliasing and I
think<00:00:38.479> we're<00:00:38.600> on<00:00:38.690> high<00:00:38.930> image<00:00:39.229> quality

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350

settings supposed to ha very high and
the<00:00:44.420> game<00:00:44.600> looks<00:00:45.170> very<00:00:45.680> good<00:00:45.920> the<00:00:46.220> three

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
the game looks very good the three

I<00:00:47.360> feel<00:00:47.900> like<00:00:48.080> add<00:00:48.320> a<00:00:48.350> lot<00:00:48.710> of<00:00:49.390> kind<00:00:50.390> of<00:00:50.479> depth

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
I feel like add a lot of kind of depth

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.780 
I feel like add a lot of kind of depth
and<00:00:50.960> immersion<00:00:51.260> to<00:00:52.040> the<00:00:52.159> game<00:00:52.339> maybe<00:00:52.549> not

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
and immersion to the game maybe not

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.990 
and immersion to the game maybe not
necessarily<00:00:53.119> in<00:00:53.449> this<00:00:53.600> tunnel<00:00:54.369> world<00:00:55.369> or<00:00:55.879> this

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
here you just you just have the ability

here you just you just have the ability

3d mode actually metro 2033 is one of

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.670 
3d mode actually metro 2033 is one of
the<00:01:21.920> more<00:01:22.130> impressive<00:01:22.430> games<00:01:23.530> that<00:01:24.530> I've

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
the more impressive games that I've

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.890 
the more impressive games that I've
actually<00:01:25.100> tested<00:01:25.940> whether<00:01:26.120> or<00:01:26.240> not<00:01:26.330> it's<00:01:26.480> in

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
actually tested whether or not it's in

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.710 
actually tested whether or not it's in
surround<00:01:27.500> mode<00:01:27.800> or<00:01:28.010> just<00:01:28.280> standard<00:01:28.670> 3d<00:01:29.510> vision

it<00:01:29.960> actually<00:01:30.260> works<00:01:30.440> really<00:01:30.620> well<00:01:30.830> one<00:01:31.130> of<00:01:31.250> the

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
it actually works really well one of the

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
it actually works really well one of the
effects<00:01:31.810> that<00:01:32.810> they<00:01:32.960> implement<00:01:33.500> in<00:01:34.330> this

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
effects that they implement in this

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.180 
effects that they implement in this
title<00:01:35.630> is<00:01:37.750> involves<00:01:38.750> particles<00:01:39.290> that<00:01:39.830> kind<00:01:40.159> of

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
title is involves particles that kind of

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.600 
title is involves particles that kind of
look<00:01:40.340> like<00:01:40.370> dust<00:01:40.760> particles<00:01:41.240> as<00:01:41.420> they<00:01:41.450> float

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
look like dust particles as they float

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.760 
look like dust particles as they float
in<00:01:43.610> the<00:01:44.120> air<00:01:44.150> and<00:01:44.570> it<00:01:44.810> actually<00:01:44.960> does<00:01:45.440> a<00:01:45.470> very

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
in the air and it actually does a very

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.380 
in the air and it actually does a very
good<00:01:46.010> job<00:01:46.070> of<00:01:46.640> implementing<00:01:47.240> those<00:01:47.590> in<00:01:48.909> 3d<00:01:49.909> so

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
good job of implementing those in 3d so

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.210 
good job of implementing those in 3d so
that<00:01:50.540> you<00:01:50.870> kind<00:01:51.080> of<00:01:51.110> want<00:01:51.170> to<00:01:51.350> reach<00:01:51.950> out<00:01:52.190> and

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
that you kind of want to reach out and

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.000 
that you kind of want to reach out and
grab<00:01:52.580> them<00:01:53.080> there's<00:01:54.080> one<00:01:54.170> instance<00:01:54.680> of<00:01:54.830> it

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
grab them there's one instance of it

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.960 
grab them there's one instance of it
right<00:01:55.850> there<00:01:56.830> and<00:01:57.830> again<00:01:58.310> just<00:01:58.550> because<00:01:58.700> the

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
right there and again just because the

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.219 
right there and again just because the
game<00:01:59.150> is<00:01:59.540> so<00:02:00.100> power<00:02:01.100> hungry<00:02:01.990> doing<00:02:02.990> it<00:02:03.110> in

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229
