00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.200
 what's up everyone here with a video 

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:07.899
 showing them the one that I do not know if I really 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:11.790
 it's an audio problem with the iphone 4s 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:11.790
 and so they buy that is the 4s 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.410
 you're not here to master it's the same 4s and 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.119
 comes the audio problem is that it does not 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.470
 play music for example if we go 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:26.130
 here at one we have this 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.880
 and not just the blue bar 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.550
 Let's continue touching her 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.550
 and the volume disappears 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.380
 the same goes for applications 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.380
 yes 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.880
 this blog 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.730
 It is not silent and you can see that it is not 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.620
 it is silent either 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.699
 for the epic 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.699
 not hear anything 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.360
 yes I saw if they are heard 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.110
 Y 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.579
 and when I make such a 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.579
 uncheck the iphone 3g 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.670
 oh yes 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:36.340
 playback the tone let's block 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:40.210
 now do not hear the blocked 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:43.380
 to see does not come out and neither does it reproduce but 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.380
 neither is listening 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.070
 but we're going with a YouTube video 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.500
 let's look for double w 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.689
 Well this 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.319
 We are in 3g and can not use the 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:20.769
 blue bar 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.769
 all right 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:26.950
 one 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.950
 like nothing audio 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.300
 you should give him the blue bar does not come out 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.950
 nothing 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.950
 and if the bar comes out 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.569
 luisi 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:53.110
 the whole blue bar but not when 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.110
 we put an external adapter 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:05.250
 and if we retire, it disappears and the same 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.250
 go with the hearing aids 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.260
 in total is what they are 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.030
 how do we put that front 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.240
 you get to appreciate the to hear 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:30.480
 we retired where was the audio being 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.040
 a problem with the software or something 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.459
 of the iphone 4s if someone has the 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.770
 solution now comment the video and good 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:41.569
 that was all thanks for your attention that 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.569
 Have a good day we are
