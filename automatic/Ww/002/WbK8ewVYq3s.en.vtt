 but they have one flaw as if 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.190
 Achilles you have them insufficient 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.830
 frost resistance that is in our 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.350
 conditions below Vika has to grow 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.170
 in the round shape 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.700
 the fact that we will see our kavalera these 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.760
 here are brush pockets 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.410
 these are all shoots last year new 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:29.050
 shoots dough which 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.690
 she will shelter in the fall in order to 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.910
 get this one lovely respects them 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.680
 need to form creeping forms in 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.350
 We mainly try to grow them 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.720
 Horizontally closer to the ground 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.180
 as soon as escape replacement come out 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.060
 land we usually try it 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.070
 kicked out and grow horizontally to the ground 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.370
 and then after the clipping of what was dropped 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.909
 denunciation 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.569
 new shoots and we can safely lay 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:56.269
 to the ground 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.489
 hide corona materials since 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.650
 winters are pretty harsh 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:03.409
 unpredictable that is one very 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.409
 severe winter there falls on 10 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:08.420
 normal therefore for guarantee i.e. 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:10.940
 covering material is never 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.190
 superfluous you cover there in two layers 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.849
 sometimes in three layers what was air 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.940
 interlayer 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:18.799
 some are covered with earth 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.650
 lapnik that is shelter is not enough 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.449
 better take cover and prices higher guarantee 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.870
 to make it so beautiful 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:25.910
 expensive 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.550
 blackberry most grateful and most 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.919
 fruitful crops that is , we have 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.449
 Russia unfortunately this direction is not 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:34.449
 pleases he already below will not buy
