00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.090
 hi all guys are the akita e 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:16.630
 today we are here in this brand new 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:19.390
 video in which I will show you some villages 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.390
 for more precisely five villages per 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.399
 the town hall at level 6 for trophies are 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.649
 pretty pretty villages of course 

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:28.930
 we have few things for the 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:31.119
 of the municipality level 6 however I have 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.480
 tried to find the best villages 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.820
 they are not in order of beauty however 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.190
 from the strongest at least strong but only in 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.600
 scattered order and I will indicate the pros and the 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.940
 against every village 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.609
 Let's start immediately with this village 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.949
 nice enough a village that has 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:51.489
 obviously the killer in the center of the mortars 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:53.350
 they are placed to the right and the left of the 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.999
 city ​​hall so I'm in a position 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.039
 central 

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:59.079
 pity only in the tones of the sorcerer 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:00.239
 that the readers of the 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.210
 sorcerer are really useful 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.320
 especially against the barbarians and archers 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.570
 resources are still enough 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.030
 so starting is a little hybrid this 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.310
 village and I recommend it 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.410
 let's now pass this second village a 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.020
 very very nice village especially 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.060
 precisely for trophies this boys is 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.130
 I think it's one of the best for how much 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.530
 concerns the trophies because we have of 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.960
 mortars in a central position covered 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.640
 from a layer of walls and resources are 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.410
 very external to which they attract them 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.720
 players who want to take only the 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:35.200
 resources at the expense of trophies for 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.000
 example air and central defense 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.880
 therefore also suitable for gold races 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.490
 however quite high and unfortunately 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.880
 the only flaw of this village is that 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.520
 the cassaro icahn out because anyway 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.930
 we have favored other things from 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.370
 put inside the city ​​and the 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:56.350
 Castro clan stayed out of this 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:59.320
 in fact it is a defect, however, a 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.540
 good village the third village 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.970
 guys is this a very village here 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.480
 very original indeed it is spiral a 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.570
 cyclone we can say 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:11.780
 and this guys because it leads the 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:14.360
 troops to the city center where 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.190
 there are no meet walls and 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.260
 meanwhile they are destroyed by the others 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.340
 defended this guys and very much 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.110
 helpful 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.140
 and in fact we also see the positive sides 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.300
 this village we have yes and mortars 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.120
 be readers of the wizard more or less at 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.920
 well positioned air defense center e 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.290
 the castor clan and more or less in the center 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.570
 so this is really this one 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.310
 great village and it's a village 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.370
 just different so if you want a 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.230
 moment change try another thing 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.180
 very important of this village 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.920
 in fact we have these traps 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.020
 snap traps where surely 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.400
 then some troops will pass 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.000
 these traps on traps are 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.410
 fundamental for this village the 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.330
 fourth village is a bit more 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.000
 normal but still very beautiful 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.770
 especially to start mortars nearby 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.010
 to the sorcerer's towers in fact 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.480
 mortars guys as we know not 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.610
 they can hit the targets they are 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.110
 precisely under the mortars that these 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.550
 versagli will be killed precisely by 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.370
 so the sorcerer's network really 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.920
 very very useful we also have cash 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.220
 of the clan more or less in the center the defense 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.110
 quite center aerial and unfortunately like 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.910
 that appears in the second village of 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.910
 gold elixir deposits are 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.130
 outside the city and therefore boys 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.170
 it is a village only for trophies then 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.620
 it's not hybrid and if you want to make resources 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.930
 you have to change village 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.700
 here we are with the last village and 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.160
 most extreme village of all because 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.800
 as you can see the elixir deposits 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.720
 they are even outside the walls therefore 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.680
 guys this is completely for 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.430
 trophies 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.829
 we have mortars 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.900
 completely at the center of the village 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:55.019
 towers of the sorcerer who are on the side 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:59.400
 to the town hall and we have this strip 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:00.629
 here without defenses we say that it causes that 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.870
 the sorcerer's reader in the meantime 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:06.260
 they can kill many troops 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:09.239
 also guys here too the deposits 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.639
 of gold are quite exposed and 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:13.469
 unfortunately as it happened over the years 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:16.350
 some of the other villages we have the 

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:18.720
 gelding between the outside but we can anyway 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.579
 always go as usual to replace it 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.759
 with air defense if they don't attack us 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:25.889
 a for example with many troops yesterday 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:29.610
 so guys these were mine 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:32.070
 five best villages I've found 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.930
 let's say I found you around 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.090
 I remember the site where I am there 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.389
 making to see is called clash of planas 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.520
 tools point com is the link you will find it 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:44.130
 as usual in description 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.560
 I remind you to put it like the 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:49.500
 facebook page and go see the 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.419
 video on how to keep gm free of which 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:55.320
 as usual the link will be below 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:57.389
 description I wanted to clarify a moment 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.300
 summing up that features 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:03.240
 main for a good village for i 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.159
 municipalities arrived six are having mortars 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:09.150
 in the center have the reader of the 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:12.090
 well positioned sorcerer have we say 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.580
 a fairly symmetrical structure e 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:18.120
 especially boys are very important 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:20.280
 traps and another thing to take 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.110
 present the cast of the clans that must 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.210
 always be also more or less at 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.710
 center with regard to defense 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.720
 instead not 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:32.110
 does not necessarily have to be at 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:34.240
 center because anyway with an inciden 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.700
 level you know you will not receive many 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.620
 attacks by air troops such as 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:41.290
 they can be big balloons 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.520
 that is, you will not have attacks from 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.070
 these troops then you can 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:48.280
 quietly leave her out of the 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:50.500
 walls or if I don't like outside the walls 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.700
 in the layer a less internal moment 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.770
 of the city 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.440
 so guys, I greet you 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.460
 I recommend ask for quotes 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.680
 I'll do it 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:02.970
 Hi everyone, I am the acts from there and there 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.970
 see in the next video
