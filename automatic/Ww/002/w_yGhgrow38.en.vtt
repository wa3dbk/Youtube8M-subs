00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.139
 hello I am dominik of test.de 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:11.290
 here is a short video waiting for the philips 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:13.769
 hr 2096 a stand mixer from albans 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.769
 collection 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.170
 The philips is one of the most beautiful of 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:19.550
 we were tested mixa but also 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.080
 the processing and the used 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.509
 you can let materials look great 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.360
 everything looks high quality and solid 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:28.340
 Mix mug is made of solid glass and 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.820
 looks very solid locks mine 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.290
 a glass container that sits very firmly 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.629
 on the station and does not wobble 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.920
 Generally one can say that the philipp 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:38.690
 Stand mixer a very thoughtful 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.360
 impression makes the supplied 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.400
 For example, teixeira can use the 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.290
 Cover for the night flights opening in the 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.769
 stowed away after ventilation to save space 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.600
 become 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:49.549
 the philipp stand mixer is controlled 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.409
 via a central rotary switch and 

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:52.549
 push the switch over the 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:55.369
 rotary switch is the device 

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:58.449
 switched on and the performance 

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:58.449
 individually determined 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.640
 It also has a moment stage 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.600
 a crushed ice function and a 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.729
 smoothie program 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.560
 the only real criticism was the 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.060
 initial plastic smell of the 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.800
 the housing interior exits 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.400
 But this disappeared after a few 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.400
 applications again 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.890
 moreover 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.380
 power turns off a little movie 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.149
 Frozen fruits and juice for them 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.130
 You can either do it over the normal one 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:35.930
 power control here or over 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.930
 the separate smith program 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.649
 as you have seen that begins 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.030
 music program on a small stage 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.030
 and increased level ever higher 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.849
 the movie has become nicely smooth 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.830
 There are no bigger fruit pieces anymore 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:24.180
 and that's very delicious of course 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.290
 are also ice cubes for the flip 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.700
 Stand mixer no problem 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.030
 He even has his own program 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:33.200
 turn it on and that 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.200
 select ice cube program 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:25.129
 as I have seen, I have something 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:27.829
 to golf with the spatula one recognizes 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:30.170
 that all ice cubes ice cubes 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:33.159
 were crushed and that was nonsense 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.159
 has a nice consistency 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.560
 the philips hr 2096 convinced that one 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.970
 external as well as its performance 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.440
 the materials and the 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.670
 Processing quality leave a 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.920
 very positive impression 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.750
 the only real criticism is the 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.970
 Initial plastic smell that though 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.350
 after some time disappears 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.060
 detailed test report included 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.070
 pictures to this stand mixer or to 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.180
