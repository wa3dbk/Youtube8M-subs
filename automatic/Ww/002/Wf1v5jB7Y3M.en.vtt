00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.220
 2 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:42.410
 yes hello Peter finger here and what I 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:46.440
 hold in my hand on my knees 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:53.580
 is a martin and what a martin 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:58.200
 guitar a huge model a j 12 16 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:01:01.500
 So g / t a twelve-sided martin 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.670
 jumbo model and a martin guitar 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.750
 from the slightly cheaper series 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:12.869
 and the first impression is here 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:15.540
 that it is beautiful guitar is easy 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.980
 playable is what with twelve-stringed 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:22.300
 guitar is not necessarily the case 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:26.240
 I used to have my twelve-sided 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.890
 Martin runs into the drake emergency fund 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.730
 it was really hard to play 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:35.030
 Besides, she has moved at the moment 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:37.630
 and I was not satisfied though 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:42.950
 this martin is this twelve-sided 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:46.610
 really nice model what we here 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.560
 have a guitar with a dense 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:55.310
 ceiling 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:57.380
 we have mahogany say and ground 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.780
 at the bottom there is a special feature 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.730
 the ground is made of a part 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:09.080
 Apparently , it did not make any sense 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:13.760
 fuge and therefore not in any 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.740
 it's all over the fugue 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.820
 solid wood of course the neck is too 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.800
 mahogany fingerboard and steaks are out 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:25.520
 a composite material so not from 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:28.390
 Wood though you do not feel that 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.350
 certain advantages for the material 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.709
 does not work as hard as wood 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:36.459
 does not warp and is so strong 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.459
 no tropical wood 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.120
 Mighty thing out of this guitar I 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.840
 I'm also here in the pick-up with 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.840
 affiliated 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:00.579
 Of course that's good for that 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.319
 you can also do streaming with it 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:05.609
 but is also a good fairy first 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:10.920
 guitar and if you like the style of 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:10.920
 leo kottke from the 70s think 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:29.990
 So that works very well with it as well 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.640
 as said playability is also 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:36.020
 very pleasant the high second is 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:38.150
 46 mm for my taste could be 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.430
 almost another two millimeters 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.780
 its but it is fine so well 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.780
 it already feels 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:55.020
 Of course, a guitar is also fine 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.020
 bottleneck game 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.549
 other sounds are also 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.460
 women stand this triad 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.830
 yes actually beautiful valley would now 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.740
 I'll see what was for 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:53.210
 Specifications have the most 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:56.860
 already said the massive for ground and 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.860
 frames and for the stop 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:09.599
 we have relatively economical left here 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.599
 and no great edge inserts 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:15.300
 Of course you can equal to the price 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:18.680
 to speak yet I said that is 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.990
 one in the slightly cheaper series 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:25.840
 there was such things as 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.840
 Of course , no elaborate deposits 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.930
 with some chromed so standard too 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:39.980
 we have a 64 5 mm 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:50.319
 I had said rider 46 mm on the saddle 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:50.319
 and 47 7 57 mm twelfth waistband 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:06:00.090
 remains to me to be to award something 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.090
 2 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:06.460
 a wooden case is a very 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:12.030
 dimensionally stable large wooden case 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:16.360
 guitarist stated with a vk of 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:17.800
 1995 euro just below 2000 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.680
 and 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:24.159
 I would say that's the one 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:26.860
 guitar value was waived as I said 

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:28.990
 so a little on the deposits of the 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:33.190
 The guitar is completely processed 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:35.949
 okay, some things are not so clean 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:37.599
 cut out like me from others 

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:39.430
 Guitars know in the slightly higher 

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:45.430
 Price range but that has ever 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:47.669
 no influence on sounded completely in 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.669
 order 

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:22.760
 I have this guitar on a chord 

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:25.230
 to determine the open at the moment 

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:28.350
 and that's just fun with one 

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:31.550
 twelve-sided instrument easy 

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:31.550
 to play on it 

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:36.580
 I can go a lot wrong at an open 

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:36.580
 June 

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.870
 I want to suggest if you the the 

00:07:42.039 --> 00:07:47.100
 If he sees the guitar somewhere 

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:51.819
 You have the opportunity to try it out 

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:54.720
 you play on it very well had 

00:07:51.819 --> 00:07:54.720
 the game feeling 

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:59.159
 very pleasant 

00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:02.750
 maybe easier than some 

00:07:59.159 --> 00:08:02.750
 other 12 12 strings 

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:08.229
 so now this guitar for me 

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.229
 a clear recommendation
