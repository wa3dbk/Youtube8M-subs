 Good day to all description 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.010
 dear friends with you for the summer dream and 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.140
 today i wanted to talk to you about 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.660
 pretty pompous with those who 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.820
 I was interested in a long time ago 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.270
 I wanted to talk about the struggle between 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.120
 call of duty to mouth and battlefield 4 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.070
 which lasts pretty big 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.620
 amount of time and today I want 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.660
 talk purely about what i do 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.360
 I think about them as I do 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.280
 and I mean these two series as 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.440
 let's start with the battlefield 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.300
 that is, today I will tell you about 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.940
 battlefield then tell you a little about 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.079
 call of duty and all that I will give 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.320
 final verdict 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.030
 and so for what we all love the battlefield 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.909
 so this is for its multiplayer 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.580
 component and probably for the indispensable 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.590
 the attribute that gives us the most expensive and 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.100
 the best game engine in the world 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.409
 frost bike destruction of course i understand 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.110
 that the engine has changed the number in the same way 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.900
 like call of duty voice but 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.479
 produces such a beautiful picture that 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.299
 any other gaming envy 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.409
 engine at the moment of course how am i 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.350
 I can forget 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.479
 a recent high-profile project then ubisoft 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.700
 tom clancy's the division which 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.860
 struck ok probably every viewer and 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.090
 me including my graphic 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:45.990
 opportunities but it's not about that now 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:49.110
 and on battlefield 4, the engine gives us more 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.930
 dynamic and lively environment that is with 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.399
 what intensity will the wind blow and 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.030
 will depend on it 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:59.549
 swinging the foliage and the tree itself on 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.649
 wind in general everything will move in 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.030
 according to the forces of nature and this 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.150
 really mesmerizing 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.509
 guys publish work on a new system 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.890
 levolution is dynamic destruction 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.380
 on a map or 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.560
 environment at a level like a dam breakthrough 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.260
 or the destruction of a huge building also 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.510
 undergone changes 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.330
 dynamic sea battles and full 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.350
 immersion thanks 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.610
 cinematic storyline in 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.950
 battlefield 4 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.319
 a call of duty multiplayer no sooner 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.300
 liked him so much 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.610
 dynamism and here it is really 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.010
 such a big dynamic was created 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.330
 someone played it in call of duty then 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.720
 eat berry played 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.610
 manner of war 3 when i played black ops 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.510
 it still understood that here they are 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.070
 really 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.080
 and tried to make such a fast 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.209
 quick quick game pretty 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.000
 dynamic multiplayer but when i 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.160
 watched multiplayer guest I just was 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.150
 at a loss and the graphics showed 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.160
 exactly sex boxing one was all green i 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.190
 I don't know why everything was green 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.290
 I just did not like it yet I am ready 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.720
 criticize them not multiplayer and give 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.299
 pretty much and a lot because 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.890
 and what's good in this multiplayer will be 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.230
 I do not think that there will be something 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.079
 good play dog ​​multiplayer 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.030

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:23.220
 she's in america there people are still possible 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.890
 it will be normal to play and we have Russia 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.989
 yes of course there will be people all playing their own 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.299
 dogs and there will be just some 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.519
 bacchanalia on servers why is it all 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.920
 I had to do I do not know tackles 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:38.250
 some useless why should 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.060
 to do was rolling this damn olya fucking 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.030
 worthy 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.370
 really guys well damn u tack 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.230
 I am associated with only one shit 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.250
 a game that I hate with all my heart 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.500
 this is warface 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.329
 but mostly here mostly me 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.090
 it really seemed like some 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:55.079
 ningen us after all they showed that 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.880
 them there engine 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.739
 but I'm not a sign on them and there engine 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.780
 vii engine some dick knows what 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.190
 because I have no idea whatsoever 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.890
 what is their new engine there 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:08.070
 Well, what a new modified as 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:12.330
 bling black ops and second modified 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:15.120
 ivy engine 3030 guys modified 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.110
 imagine 40 and made modern 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.220
 warfare 3 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:22.470
 and on 30 just modified on 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:25.710
 modified 30 made black ops 2 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:28.140
 and then you sit and think why is it 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:31.320
 all why are all companies for the sake of money 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:33.090
 here guys do not judge strictly me here 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.850
 Now who listens to me at all 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.670
 techniques now watching this all for the sake of 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.860
 damn money because companies need 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:43.310
 somehow making money and they are for you 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.170
 develops call of duty every year and 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.090
 so well, and so they build 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:51.000
 just finalized the engine a little bit 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.770
 change the textures made there more 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.740
 correct and direct motion capture 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.870
 did something really similar to 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.510
 games from this but our new 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.180
 generation plan there console which 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:06.240
 Now here's a new one done but damn 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.430
 fuck it again to release I understand 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.290
 freeze the project i'm not saying that 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.750
 close and absolutely call of duty and 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:15.090
 In general, the whole series of games and just freeze 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.250
 for a while project for a year there for 2 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:20.340
 make and pretty decent engine 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.680
 Yes, that is, make the engine finish there 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.320
 graphics make a whale cool animation 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.210
 it came out just some kind of orgy 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.010
 I certainly understand that now everyone 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.770
 the second litters call of duty 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:33.630
 but damn 0 really but guys well I will not 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.710
 do not judge strictly but this is really 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.740
 shit 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:40.590
 the game just does not pull out of its scope 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:43.560
 shooterry that is earlier when it was still 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:45.419
 non mainstream when it’s fair 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.150
 it came out when there were all these here 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:49.830
 black ops and i thought so sat vault 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.750
 these are really cool games why 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.210
 would not play and now I think the opposite 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.100
 so why play this? 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.710
 need a pancake dog runs in multiplayer 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:01.500
 I will not buy honestly 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.660
 what not to buy to logic is one hundred percent 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.940
 I will not invest in them not these 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:08.400
 here are game development and 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.680
 and here are these bobby kitty at all throw 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.290
 all this it freezes me this 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:16.020
 company and in conclusion I want to say that 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:18.120
 you can see the battlefield figure in the engine and in 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:21.450
 call of duty series 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.280
 it's just a call call of duty so long as I 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:25.260
 good luck put likes comment 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:28.140

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.560
