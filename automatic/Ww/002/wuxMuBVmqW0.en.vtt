00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:07.380
 this is one of many tutorials that 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.720
 I think about building and 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.950
 yard 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:17.600
 Today I 'm going to show you how to program the 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:19.440
 watering in a clock and risoul we'll start 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.060
 with 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.060
 how to program the water 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.930
 move the button to where it says 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:33.460
 program program 1 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.460
 you press number 1 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:40.540
 and we can see if where it says fourth in 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.930
 question to 40 years and we see that this 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.990
 has five minutes of watering 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.190
 this has to change that you press 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:53.079
 click 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.079
 you press number one 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:59.350
 you press wartime that gives you 5 minutes 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.060
 then now you come and follow us and you 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.860
 you want eight minutes for that station 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:07.090
 then you press 8 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.030
 Awesome 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.300
 this then you have eight minutes to the 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.920
 station 1 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:19.830
 and so you can do in the performance 2 3 4 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.100
 of the same process if you want to be 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.930
 and know how 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.420
 so that your water starts what hours 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.550
 start your water always you stay the 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.440
 program 1 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:34.770
 you press number 1 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.610
 and press now where you say to bed 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.710
 lay down 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.480
 and we see that here starts at 5 o'clock 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.340
 tomorrow if you want to change that for 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.720
 change our the 5 mornings let's say 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.240
 can be next to the morning 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.880
 then press click 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.520
 I know that zero deletions the hour 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.920
 that you want them to start for 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.780
 this moment we are going to put at three 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.780
 in the morning two expressions 3 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.180
 3 in the morning then 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.519
 let's do it again number 1 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:16.310
 you have to be a month at 5 for 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:16.310
 change that you put this on all three sides 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.770
 that nascent 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.250
 this morning 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:30.910
 another thing is that this sundial 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:34.990
 then you can learn what you need 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:37.210
 who will know so much about the clock but this time 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.260
 this manual can turn on the springboks 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.120
 manuals 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.579
 to be able to surprise then press 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.140
 manual for this is not the button where 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:47.019
 says manual this pressing tells me 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.980
 so many electric manuals 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.980
 automatically reward is required 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.659
 another one of the options is 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.830
 baker rainy day put by is a 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.490
 rhythm 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.490
 pl 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:10.910
 if we go to these stations 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.380
 if you want to test your stations and see 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.940
 that all the peaks work well and 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.560
 all the valves are working well 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.560
 that you go to the station 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.810
 and then you, if you want to put two 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.890
 minutes three minutes so that time 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.890
 that you want to be able 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:34.510
 in each valve as I say so far 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.510
 you go to programmed program 1 programs 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.140
 well as I say this is one of the 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.120
 first video and then I start to be a lot 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.790
 more about watches not only and retro 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.260
 but also see imbert gold too 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.090
 about plants 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.810
 this is one of my first videos and 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.200

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.200
