from neca I'm not a hundred percent sure
what<00:05:17.639> it<00:05:17.759> is<00:05:17.789> but<00:05:18.180> I<00:05:18.750> think<00:05:19.080> I<00:05:19.199> know<00:05:19.259> what<00:05:19.620> it<00:05:19.710> is

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
what it is but I think I know what it is

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.420 
what it is but I think I know what it is
it's<00:05:21.150> a<00:05:21.270> big<00:05:21.569> box<00:05:21.840> you<00:05:22.560> guys<00:05:22.740> might<00:05:23.039> be<00:05:23.069> able<00:05:23.250> to

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
it's a big box you guys might be able to

guess<00:05:23.789> what<00:05:24.389> it<00:05:24.419> is<00:05:24.539> from<00:05:24.870> the<00:05:24.990> size<00:05:25.229> weighs

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889 
guess what it is from the size weighs

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:28.339 
guess what it is from the size weighs
about<00:05:26.039> seven<00:05:26.430> pounds<00:05:26.610> I'm<00:05:26.970> thinking<00:05:27.750> it<00:05:28.169> is<00:05:28.199> a

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:28.349 
about seven pounds I'm thinking it is a

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:32.089 
about seven pounds I'm thinking it is a
quarter<00:05:28.740> scale<00:05:29.009> figure<00:05:29.460> and<00:05:30.590> we<00:05:31.590> will<00:05:31.770> see

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:32.099 
quarter scale figure and we will see

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:35.779 
quarter scale figure and we will see
about<00:05:32.580> that<00:05:33.770> and<00:05:34.770> for<00:05:35.129> the<00:05:35.219> record<00:05:35.370> there's<00:05:35.729> a

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:35.789 
about that and for the record there's a

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:37.670 
about that and for the record there's a
cat<00:05:36.090> right<00:05:36.270> underneath<00:05:36.750> the<00:05:36.990> camera<00:05:37.349> and<00:05:37.560> he's

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
cat right underneath the camera and he's

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.469 
cat right underneath the camera and he's
not<00:05:37.949> bothering<00:05:38.430> anything<00:05:38.909> so<00:05:39.090> that's<00:05:39.270> pretty

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
not bothering anything so that's pretty

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:42.379

Marvel<00:07:20.810> Universe<00:07:20.839> scale<00:07:21.560> i<00:07:21.589> believe

00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:22.039 
Marvel Universe scale i believe

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:25.929 
Marvel Universe scale i believe
technically<00:07:23.770> based<00:07:24.770> on<00:07:24.979> the<00:07:25.159> size<00:07:25.430> it<00:07:25.759> looks

00:07:25.929 --> 00:07:25.939 
technically based on the size it looks

00:07:25.939 --> 00:07:27.279 
technically based on the size it looks
like<00:07:26.089> they<00:07:26.240> are<00:07:26.419> because<00:07:26.569> they<00:07:26.659> look<00:07:26.930> to<00:07:27.139> be<00:07:27.199> a

00:07:27.279 --> 00:07:27.289 
like they are because they look to be a

00:07:27.289 --> 00:07:28.510 
like they are because they look to be a
little<00:07:27.439> bit<00:07:27.529> taller<00:07:27.770> almost<00:07:28.099> like<00:07:28.189> four<00:07:28.370> and<00:07:28.490> a

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:28.520

half<00:07:28.580> five<00:07:28.849> inches<00:07:29.210> roughly<00:07:29.960> so<00:07:30.680> the<00:07:30.830> scaling

00:07:31.179 --> 00:07:31.189 
half five inches roughly so the scaling

00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:32.200 
half five inches roughly so the scaling
looks<00:07:31.339> pretty<00:07:31.550> good<00:07:31.669> and<00:07:31.789> they<00:07:31.879> have<00:07:31.969> lots<00:07:32.060> of
