our<00:00:00.480> second<00:00:00.870> rig<00:00:00.989> is<00:00:01.170> gonna<00:00:01.350> be<00:00:01.439> a<00:00:01.469> character

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
our second rig is gonna be a character

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.450 
our second rig is gonna be a character
that<00:00:02.010> I<00:00:02.070> like<00:00:02.399> to<00:00:02.550> call<00:00:02.700> mr.<00:00:03.000> squeegee<00:00:03.990> feet<00:00:04.200> I

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:04.460 
that I like to call mr. squeegee feet I

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.249 
that I like to call mr. squeegee feet I
call<00:00:05.460> him<00:00:05.549> that<00:00:05.609> because<00:00:05.759> he<00:00:06.060> has<00:00:06.779> squeegees

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
call him that because he has squeegees

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.440 
call him that because he has squeegees
four<00:00:07.440> feet<00:00:07.610> he's<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.639> great<00:00:08.970> friend<00:00:09.120> to<00:00:09.330> have

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
four feet he's a great friend to have

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.480 
four feet he's a great friend to have
around<00:00:09.719> when<00:00:10.019> you<00:00:10.290> want<00:00:10.410> something<00:00:10.740> squeegeed

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
around when you want something squeegeed

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.089 
around when you want something squeegeed
and<00:00:11.809> he's<00:00:12.809> pretty<00:00:13.110> much<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.290> only<00:00:13.710> friend<00:00:13.950> you

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
and he's pretty much the only friend you

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.060 
and he's pretty much the only friend you
ever<00:00:14.130> want<00:00:14.580> dancing<00:00:14.969> on<00:00:15.059> your<00:00:15.210> car<00:00:15.770> now<00:00:16.770> there

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
ever want dancing on your car now there

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.560 
ever want dancing on your car now there
are<00:00:17.160> two<00:00:17.279> different<00:00:17.550> approaches<00:00:18.060> we<00:00:18.180> can<00:00:18.210> take

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
are two different approaches we can take

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.960 
are two different approaches we can take
to<00:00:18.810> rigging<00:00:19.140> mr.<00:00:19.410> squeegee<00:00:19.770> feet<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.699> first

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
to rigging mr. squeegee feet the first

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.700 
to rigging mr. squeegee feet the first
is<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.300> dive<00:00:21.449> right<00:00:21.779> in<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.020> start<00:00:22.320> rigging

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
is to dive right in and start rigging

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.950 
is to dive right in and start rigging
him<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.789> second<00:00:24.090> is<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.210> break<00:00:24.480> him<00:00:24.600> down<00:00:24.630> into

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
him the second is to break him down into

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.050 
him the second is to break him down into
parts<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.619> figure<00:00:26.279> out<00:00:26.310> how<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.490> rig<00:00:26.730> each<00:00:26.880> of

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
parts and figure out how to rig each of

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.259 
parts and figure out how to rig each of
those<00:00:27.180> parts<00:00:27.630> one<00:00:27.990> at<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.199> time<00:00:28.550> I'm<00:00:29.550> gonna<00:00:30.060> take

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
those parts one at a time I'm gonna take

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.479 
those parts one at a time I'm gonna take
that<00:00:30.480> second<00:00:30.929> approach<00:00:31.170> I<00:00:31.470> am<00:00:31.920> NOT<00:00:32.099> personally

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
that second approach I am NOT personally

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.700 
that second approach I am NOT personally
smart<00:00:33.059> enough<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.510> tackle<00:00:33.899> all<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.380> problems

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
smart enough to tackle all the problems

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.860 
smart enough to tackle all the problems
of<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.890> character<00:00:35.219> rig<00:00:35.340> all<00:00:35.520> at<00:00:35.640> once<00:00:35.880> it's<00:00:36.719> too

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
of a character rig all at once it's too

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.540 
of a character rig all at once it's too
easy<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.140> get<00:00:37.350> confused<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:37.980> lose<00:00:38.129> track<00:00:38.309> of

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
easy to get confused and lose track of

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.209 
easy to get confused and lose track of
things<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:39.140> prefer<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.260> take<00:00:40.440> on<00:00:40.590> one<00:00:40.860> problem

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
things I prefer to take on one problem

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:41.600 
things I prefer to take on one problem
at<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.399> time

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
at a time

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.520 
at a time
and<00:00:41.879> then<00:00:42.180> assemble<00:00:42.570> all<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.050> individual

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
and then assemble all of the individual

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.590 
and then assemble all of the individual
solutions<00:00:44.040> in<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.309> final<00:00:44.610> rig<00:00:44.789> after<00:00:45.180> I'm

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
solutions in the final rig after I'm

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.020 
solutions in the final rig after I'm
satisfied<00:00:46.140> with<00:00:46.320> them<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.789> think<00:00:47.789> this<00:00:47.910> is

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
satisfied with them I think this is

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.610 
satisfied with them I think this is
usually<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.539> best<00:00:48.690> way<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.930> approach<00:00:49.260> rigging

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
usually the best way to approach rigging

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.290 
usually the best way to approach rigging
and<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.980> strongly<00:00:50.309> suggest<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.030> do<00:00:51.149> the

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
and I strongly suggest that you do the

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.380 
and I strongly suggest that you do the
same<00:00:52.190> so<00:00:53.190> what<00:00:53.309> parts<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.640> mr.<00:00:53.879> squeegee<00:00:54.239> feet

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
same so what parts of mr. squeegee feet

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.260 
same so what parts of mr. squeegee feet
do<00:00:54.510> we<00:00:54.570> need<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.809> rig<00:00:55.520> thankfully<00:00:56.520> he's<00:00:57.239> a

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
do we need to rig thankfully he's a

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.270 
do we need to rig thankfully he's a
fairly<00:00:57.750> simple<00:00:58.020> character<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:58.920> we<00:00:59.039> really

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
fairly simple character so we really

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.720 
fairly simple character so we really
only<00:00:59.309> need<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.760> rig<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.940> few<00:01:00.120> parts<00:01:00.420> his<00:01:01.289> eyes

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
only need to rig a few parts his eyes

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.609 
only need to rig a few parts his eyes
his<00:01:02.730> legs<00:01:03.170> his<00:01:04.170> feet<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.799> his<00:01:05.760> body<00:01:06.630> or<00:01:07.320> head

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
his legs his feet and his body or head

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.039 
his legs his feet and his body or head
or<00:01:07.680> whatever<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.600> that<00:01:09.600> seems<00:01:09.810> pretty

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
or whatever it is that seems pretty

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.140 
or whatever it is that seems pretty
manageable<00:01:10.350> we<00:01:11.340> can<00:01:11.490> figure<00:01:11.640> out<00:01:11.820> how<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:11.970> rig

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
manageable we can figure out how to rig

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.000 
manageable we can figure out how to rig
each<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.510> these<00:01:12.600> parts<00:01:12.960> separately<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.590> then

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
each of these parts separately and then

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.590 
each of these parts separately and then
build<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.369> final<00:01:14.729> rig<00:01:14.909> using<00:01:15.360> what<00:01:15.509> we

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
build the final rig using what we

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.350 
build the final rig using what we
figured<00:01:15.780> out<00:01:16.220> but<00:01:17.220> before<00:01:17.340> we<00:01:17.700> do<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:17.880> we

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
figured out but before we do that we

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.789 
figured out but before we do that we
need<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.630> figure<00:01:18.780> out<00:01:18.990> what<00:01:19.140> mr.<00:01:19.259> squeegee

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
need to figure out what mr. squeegee

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.880 
need to figure out what mr. squeegee
feet<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.189> gonna<00:01:20.580> be<00:01:20.729> used<00:01:20.939> for<00:01:21.060> in<00:01:21.450> fact<00:01:22.200> that's

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
feet is gonna be used for in fact that's

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.200 
feet is gonna be used for in fact that's
pretty<00:01:23.130> much<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.430> first<00:01:23.580> step<00:01:23.880> with<00:01:24.060> any

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
pretty much the first step with any

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.050 
pretty much the first step with any
rigging<00:01:24.450> job<00:01:24.780> figuring<00:01:25.680> out<00:01:26.009> what<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.670> rig<00:01:26.820> is

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
rigging job figuring out what the rig is

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.450 
rigging job figuring out what the rig is
gonna<00:01:27.270> be<00:01:27.450> used<00:01:27.630> for<00:01:27.930> it's<00:01:28.829> just<00:01:29.310> like

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
gonna be used for it's just like

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.760 
gonna be used for it's just like
designing<00:01:29.820> anything<00:01:30.270> else<00:01:30.600> if<00:01:31.500> you're<00:01:31.619> gonna

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
designing anything else if you're gonna

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
to know if the person is going to be

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.460 
to know if the person is going to be

spaghetti<00:01:42.119> they<00:01:42.810> might<00:01:43.110> need<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.290> fork<00:01:43.619> if<00:01:44.399> you

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
spaghetti they might need a fork if you

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.950 
spaghetti they might need a fork if you
don't<00:01:44.820> know<00:01:45.030> what<00:01:45.210> they're<00:01:45.360> gonna<00:01:45.479> be<00:01:45.659> eating

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
don't know what they're gonna be eating

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.050

you<00:01:46.439> could<00:01:46.590> always<00:01:46.799> design<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.130> spork<00:01:47.610> which

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
you could always design a spork which

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.609 
you could always design a spork which
will<00:01:48.509> at<00:01:48.570> least<00:01:48.630> get<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.990> job<00:01:49.170> done<00:01:49.380> in<00:01:49.500> either

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
will at least get the job done in either

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.789 
will at least get the job done in either
case<00:01:50.390> but<00:01:51.390> if<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.600> know<00:01:51.720> exactly<00:01:52.350> what<00:01:52.680> the

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
case but if you know exactly what the

case but if you know exactly what the

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
utensil is gonna be used for then you

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.959 
utensil is gonna be used for then you
can<00:01:55.079> really<00:01:55.500> design<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:56.070> be<00:01:56.189> amazing<00:01:56.759> for

can really design it to be amazing for

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.929 
can really design it to be amazing for
that<00:01:57.119> specific<00:01:57.750> case<00:01:58.159> the<00:01:59.159> same<00:01:59.399> is<00:01:59.579> true<00:01:59.610> with

have stopped there on this DVD I get to

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.380 
have stopped there on this DVD I get to
make<00:02:28.950> up<00:02:29.160> our<00:02:29.490> requirements<00:02:31.190> and<00:02:32.190> I<00:02:33.180> will<00:02:33.300> be

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
make up our requirements and I will be

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.880 
make up our requirements and I will be
specifying<00:02:33.900> those<00:02:34.110> requirements<00:02:34.740> at<00:02:34.860> the

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
specifying those requirements at the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.800 
specifying those requirements at the
beginning<00:02:35.310> of<00:02:35.430> each<00:02:35.550> chapter<00:02:35.580> so<00:02:36.420> you<00:02:36.510> can<00:02:36.660> get

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
beginning of each chapter so you can get

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.260 
beginning of each chapter so you can get
used<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:37.110> thinking<00:02:37.380> about<00:02:37.500> rigging<00:02:37.890> this<00:02:38.040> way

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
used to thinking about rigging this way

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.030 
used to thinking about rigging this way
rigging<00:02:39.270> is<00:02:39.420> a<00:02:39.450> means<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:40.050> an<00:02:40.230> end

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
rigging is a means to an end

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.180 
rigging is a means to an end
so<00:02:41.490> you<00:02:41.550> need<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:41.910> know<00:02:42.030> what<00:02:42.150> that<00:02:42.300> end<00:02:42.510> is<00:02:42.720> in

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
so you need to know what that end is in

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.220 
so you need to know what that end is in
the<00:02:44.190> case<00:02:44.370> of<00:02:44.520> mr.<00:02:44.730> squeegee<00:02:45.180> feeds<00:02:45.390> I'm<00:02:45.660> going

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
the case of mr. squeegee feeds I'm going

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.740 
the case of mr. squeegee feeds I'm going
to<00:02:46.430> artificially<00:02:47.430> say<00:02:47.670> that<00:02:48.000> we<00:02:48.240> don't<00:02:48.600> need

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
to artificially say that we don't need

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.780 
to artificially say that we don't need
squash<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:49.290> stretch<00:02:49.560> mr.<00:02:50.370> squeegee<00:02:50.700> your

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
squash and stretch mr. squeegee your

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.670 
squash and stretch mr. squeegee your
feed<00:02:50.910> is<00:02:50.940> sufficiently<00:02:51.690> silly<00:02:51.990> without<00:02:52.200> hats

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
feed is sufficiently silly without hats

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.430 
feed is sufficiently silly without hats
I'm<00:02:53.310> also<00:02:53.940> gonna<00:02:54.150> say<00:02:54.390> that<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.840> only<00:02:55.020> things

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
I'm also gonna say that the only things

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.160 
I'm also gonna say that the only things
mr.<00:02:55.650> squeegee<00:02:56.070> feet<00:02:56.250> ever<00:02:56.520> does<00:02:56.850> is<00:02:57.180> walk<00:02:57.870> and

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
mr. squeegee feet ever does is walk and

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.940 
mr. squeegee feet ever does is walk and
look<00:02:59.010> around<00:02:59.340> he<00:03:00.300> doesn't<00:03:00.630> fly<00:03:00.780> or<00:03:01.320> fall<00:03:01.680> from

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
look around he doesn't fly or fall from

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.490 
look around he doesn't fly or fall from
great<00:03:02.280> heights<00:03:02.580> or<00:03:02.970> do<00:03:03.150> acrobatics<00:03:03.570> or<00:03:04.200> make

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
great heights or do acrobatics or make

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.890 
great heights or do acrobatics or make
facial<00:03:05.010> expressions<00:03:05.550> or<00:03:05.820> anything<00:03:06.570> like<00:03:06.840> that

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
facial expressions or anything like that

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.250 
facial expressions or anything like that
all<00:03:07.860> he<00:03:08.370> ever<00:03:08.550> does<00:03:09.030> is<00:03:09.390> walk<00:03:10.050> and<00:03:10.350> look<00:03:11.190> around

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
all he ever does is walk and look around

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.590 
all he ever does is walk and look around
so<00:03:13.260> with<00:03:13.740> those<00:03:13.890> requirements<00:03:14.250> in<00:03:14.610> mind<00:03:14.640> let's
