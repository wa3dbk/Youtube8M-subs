 very good to everyone again and has returned 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:07.100
 from new york and here you have some 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:10.429
 botillos and a video that I'll leave to you 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.440
 end of this good 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:14.539
 the awesome journey that is to say has 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.590
 enchanted not only by the city but 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:21.260
 because people are an ultra-open people 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.100
 they talk to you for anything butt 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.170
 kind everyone 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.750
 it is said to be a dangerous city and 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:32.020
 for nothing is totally safe ask us 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:35.410
 a temporary and horrible is to say as is 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.000
 we arrived at the airport there were like us 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.010
 like to say a meter and a half 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.170
 snow 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.030
 but good the next day it started 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:47.019
 improve the cold weather we were 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:49.420
 at least 10 degrees normally out of 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:51.100
 two days it snowed again but good gives 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.620
 a special charm to the city 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.750
 here as you see something of what I 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.260
 feeds these days hamburgers two 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.269
 many have eaten pizzas nasty 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.159
 this basically to save us some 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.140
 money not because you do not eat well in 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:08.480
 new york that is not worth you can eat 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.840
 as good or better than in Spain 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:14.900
 and nothing here have rockefeller center the 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.610
 empire state is an incredible city that 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.150
 you can do anything at all 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:23.480
 hours of the day any day of the week 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:25.910
 a mix of people that you have that is 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.880
 Awesome a trip that has to be repeated 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:31.550
 I'm definitely thinking about going back 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.320
 shortly because I'm left wanting 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.630
 the rest 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.159
 and nothing the only thing that I lacked was the 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.580
 I travel this they do with a 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:43.100
 helicopter that good we did not 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.440
 because in exchange for not doing this we went 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.680
 to watch a game of the nba that they played 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:51.170
 the new york knicks against the lakers and 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.330
 what I am going to leave you next is 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.970
 a video of what would be the entry of 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.950
 the players will see at first like 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:02.320
 a violinist will play the national anthem 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:04.150
 from the united states and then 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.420
 and then you will see what the entrance would be 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:10.810
 of the players of the knicks what 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.880
 would be what would be the party of the 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.080
 nba it 's amazing to say I never had 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:20.020
 been in something with an ambientazo of this 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.110
 calibrate an atmosphere a piece 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.300
 stadium that is what 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.520
 who laughs or can be laughed at 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.650
 any sports show that 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.960
 we see here in Spain and now I was 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.430
 The parties of the 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.510
 nba if you see yourself on TV you can 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.640
 do a little bit long but being there 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:42.390
 you fly by is a kind of 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:46.950
 constant show that makes you pass 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.390
 flying the party and the bad of the 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.430
 lakers is that he was not kobe bryant 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.440
 because you do not know how to follow the nba but 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.170
 he had a very serious injury that he had to 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.510
 be operated and it takes about eight months of 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.550
 low it was gasol that I did 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.239
 Photos and occasionally made some 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.550
 zoomed and they won the knicks so well 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.160
 for good for the new yort because 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.290
 we were there supporting them they gave us 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.390
 blankets of new york knicks a 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.989
 things that are inflated to move and 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.060
 distracting the rival being and pressing is 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.280
 say whenever the lakers come 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.970
 obviously stadiums are filled I do not know 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.790
 how is it normally but it's nice to see 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.230
 something 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.500
 or something like this 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:34.050
 respect to the channel has come out I have seen the 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.720
 new map of aliens I do not know if I'm going 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.890
 to go down because I come from the plane that does not 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.280
 asleep nothing is to say I have 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.440
 more than 24 hours awake 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.270
 so I do not think there 's a game 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.060
 because I 'm pretty tired so 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.920
 I would be birthing a bit I will try to go 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.260
 to sleep at night because I eat 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.090
 you know 66 hours apart 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.950
 I will try a bit to adapt to the schedule 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.140
 Spanish I do not want to stick to a sobada 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:03.340
 brutal because if not becoming the 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:06.100
 night and did not sleep for nothing that I 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.050

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.910
