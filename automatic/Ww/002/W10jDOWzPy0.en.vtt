00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
that the stuff that I thought might be

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.990 
that the stuff that I thought might be
good<00:01:38.350> that<00:01:38.650> I've<00:01:38.770> asking<00:01:39.070> Kobe<00:01:39.370> put<00:01:39.610> in<00:01:39.730> and

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
good that I've asking Kobe put in and

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.060 
good that I've asking Kobe put in and

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
he'd actually make it more authentic and

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:48.780 
he'd actually make it more authentic and
skateable<00:01:46.410> at<00:01:47.410> top<00:01:47.680> of<00:01:47.710> the<00:01:47.860> hill<00:01:48.130> there's<00:01:48.550> the

get that get that do you there's maybe

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.630 
get that get that do you there's maybe
even<00:02:22.110> some<00:02:22.440> hidden<00:02:22.620> little<00:02:22.890> areas<00:02:23.220> that<00:02:23.430> have

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
even some hidden little areas that have

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.210 
even some hidden little areas that have
pretty<00:02:24.510> difficult<00:02:24.660> things<00:02:25.050> to<00:02:25.140> skate<00:02:25.470> but<00:02:25.830> all

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
pretty difficult things to skate but all

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.920 
pretty difficult things to skate but all
in<00:02:26.370> all<00:02:26.490> you<00:02:26.700> can<00:02:26.850> kind<00:02:27.060> of<00:02:27.120> find<00:02:27.330> a<00:02:27.600> little<00:02:27.750> bit

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
in all you can kind of find a little bit

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.090 
in all you can kind of find a little bit
everything<00:02:28.350> there<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:28.500> think<00:02:28.620> some<00:02:28.920> of<00:02:28.950> the

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
everything there I think some of the

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.160 
everything there I think some of the
hidden<00:02:30.000> gems<00:02:30.210> are<00:02:30.510> some<00:02:30.630> of<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.780> pools<00:02:30.990> that

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
hidden gems are some of the pools that

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.290 
hidden gems are some of the pools that
we<00:02:31.350> have<00:02:31.530> skate<00:02:31.950> that<00:02:32.280> in<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.640> kind<00:02:33.240> of

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
we have skate that in the kind of

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.630 
we have skate that in the kind of
residential<00:02:33.750> area<00:02:34.140> of<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.410> university<00:02:34.980> there

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
residential area of the university there

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.400 
residential area of the university there
