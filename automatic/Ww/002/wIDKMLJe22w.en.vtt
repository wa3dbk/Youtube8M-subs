00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
I'll show you what would come in the kit

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.150 
I'll show you what would come in the kit
after<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.640> take<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:33.030> apart

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
after I take it apart

first of all 9/16 wrench take the cap

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.240 
first of all 9/16 wrench take the cap
off<00:00:42.110> it'll<00:00:43.110> be<00:00:43.200> stuck<00:00:43.440> until<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:43.860> get<00:00:44.010> past

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
off it'll be stuck until you get past

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:53.510 
off it'll be stuck until you get past
the<00:00:44.430> o-ring<00:00:48.620> turn<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.770> free

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.460 

underneath<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.390> cap<00:00:54.600> you'll<00:00:54.810> find<00:00:55.080> spring

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.470 
underneath the cap you'll find spring

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.860 
underneath the cap you'll find spring
under<00:00:58.470> the<00:00:58.590> seat<00:00:58.830> there<00:00:59.760> under<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.420> spring<00:01:00.720> is

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
under the seat there under the spring is

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:14.150 
under the seat there under the spring is
the<00:01:01.050> seat<00:01:08.570> is<00:01:09.570> there<00:01:10.700> now<00:01:12.350> it's<00:01:13.350> also<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.710> Cajun

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
the seat is there now it's also a Cajun

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.160 
the seat is there now it's also a Cajun
here<00:01:14.340> but<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.670> get<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:14.940> Keijo<00:01:15.450> we<00:01:15.840> need<00:01:16.020> to

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
here but to get that Keijo we need to

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.000 
here but to get that Keijo we need to
remove<00:01:16.760> the<00:01:17.760> pin<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.270> actually<00:01:18.690> actually

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
remove the pin that actually actually

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.620 
remove the pin that actually actually
actuates<00:01:20.010> that<00:01:20.850> seat

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.370 

so<00:01:24.630> we<00:01:24.750> first<00:01:25.050> pull<00:01:25.260> up<00:01:25.290> on<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.680> trigger

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
so we first pull up on the trigger

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.080 
so we first pull up on the trigger
moving<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:28.530> pin<00:01:29.040> up<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:29.430> we<00:01:29.580> can<00:01:29.729> get<00:01:29.850> at<00:01:30.060> it

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
moving this pin up so we can get at it

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:37.070 
moving this pin up so we can get at it
underneath<00:01:33.830> take<00:01:34.830> a<00:01:35.119> flight<00:01:36.119> instrument<00:01:36.780> or<00:01:37.050> a

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
underneath take a flight instrument or a

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.150 
underneath take a flight instrument or a
peck<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:38.720> push<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.930> rod<00:01:40.140> up<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.710> can<00:01:40.950> feel

it coming past the cage take their
needlenose<00:01:45.270> pliers

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
needlenose pliers

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:54.760 
needlenose pliers
reach<00:01:46.770> inside

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:03.970 

grab<00:01:55.310> hold<00:01:55.580> of<00:01:55.760> the<00:01:55.880> pin<00:02:00.640> remove<00:02:01.640> the<00:02:01.820> pins<00:02:02.980> now
