00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.679
 Today, the big screen is no one 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.660
 surprise and the stylus is basically the same 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.460
 but if you hang on all of this 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.410
 acceptable price tag then even the most 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.769

 reduce the frame around the display 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.699
 due to the capacious battery case turned out 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.219
 weighty 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:51.469
 but it is rather thin so by 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.299
 ergonomics, no complaints on 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.549

 removable back panel made of 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.000
 glossy plastic looks beautiful 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.160
 only the first few minutes because 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.110
 then the whole gloss is covered with prints 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.300
 under the cover we see two slots for sim 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.950
 standard size cards and slot for 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.950
 micro sd memory card 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.970
 as I said, the screen takes 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.250
 almost all front panel 5 inches 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.220
 look just huge but with such 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.140
 The magnificence of resolution qhd drives in

 pixel nike and of course the matrix 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.610
 ips 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.069
 what is the impression that smoothes everything 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.739
 getting better with ip matrix 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:20.830
 so in general, and viewing angles and color 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.630
 display coverage is good one more thing in 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.940
 no display settings 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.160
 auto tuning brightness and deadly 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.510
 Of course, but not all the time to twist it 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.510
 the most exciting thing to do 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.810
 one of the great features of a smartphone is 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.210
 the stylus looks pretty unusual 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.730
 ending in unusual plastic 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:45.220
 feather pretty funny rubber 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.230
 ball like ordinary universal 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.510
 stylus and pen but this with another 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.700
 no smartphones work 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.290
 additional joy from the stylus you're not 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.640
 get it thin 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.540
 no buttons on it there is no pressing force and 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.460
 recognize text smartphone not 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.230
 going though for the price 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.230
 expect all of this would be found 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.640
 android 4 smartphone operating system 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.830
 1 also jellybin 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.410
 just a little old man from useful 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.840
 acquisitions familiar to us from the flagship g2 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.060
 knot function which allows it 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.920
 wake up or put to sleep smartphone 2 min 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.440
 trails are another useful feature. 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.210
 setting the guest mode is useful 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.400
 those who sometimes give the phone in hand 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.110
 friends or children and you don't want to 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.540
 someone got access to personal 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.940
 information or accidentally deleted expensive 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.680
 you pictures to fully appreciate 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.810
 the advantages of a large display in 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.360
 the smartphone has a lot of support 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.980
 windows new mode and slide though 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.930
 notice the choice of applications that 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.959
 support this mode is not so 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.959
 big 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.310
 if you are using a smartphone camera 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.790
 when there is no ordinary camera under 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.520
 by hand 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.590
 This model is clearly especially good for you. 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.630
 work out photos in the daytime when 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.730
 bright light turns out well 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.950
 macro shooting in the evening will have 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.380
 enjoy flash picture when recording 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.450
 the video is a little upsetting noisy but 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.650
 there is an interesting opportunity to put it 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.230
 pause shooting 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:19.390
 and then continue writing apparently the words 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.390
 wine developer haunts 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.600

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.389
 everything 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:32.919
 that's why the smartphone is installed 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:34.840
 dual-core mediatek mt6577 clock 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:40.060

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:41.620
 and graphics accelerator powervr sgx531 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.630
 well, antutu benchmark results 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.910
 thai but cheap 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.430
 although in fairness, I note that 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.770
 smart phone works pretty fast yes 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.870

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.970
 but it doesnâ€™t seem to take off 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.380
 Gigabyte of RAM went 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.330
 but thanks to the infrared port 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.840
