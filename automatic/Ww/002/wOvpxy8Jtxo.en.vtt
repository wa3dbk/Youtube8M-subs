00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
figured out a neat little way to do that

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.040 
figured out a neat little way to do that
with<00:00:07.710> water<00:00:08.639> bottles<00:00:09.059> gives<00:00:09.630> you<00:00:09.780> a<00:00:09.840> way<00:00:10.019> to

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
with water bottles gives you a way to

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.990 
with water bottles gives you a way to
put<00:00:10.320> these<00:00:10.440> little<00:00:10.769> buggers<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.340> use<00:00:11.519> one<00:00:11.790> more

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
put these little buggers to use one more

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.510 
put these little buggers to use one more
time<00:00:12.240> in<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:13.259> form<00:00:13.559> of<00:00:15.020> planters<00:00:16.220> the<00:00:17.220> design

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
time in the form of planters the design

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.250 
time in the form of planters the design
is<00:00:17.699> really<00:00:17.730> simple<00:00:18.180> you<00:00:18.510> just<00:00:18.900> cut<00:00:19.380> it<00:00:19.529> up

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 
is really simple you just cut it up

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.750 
is really simple you just cut it up
whoops<00:00:23.269> into<00:00:24.269> two<00:00:24.750> pieces<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.980> top<00:00:26.220> piece<00:00:26.460> and

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
whoops into two pieces the top piece and

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.169 
whoops into two pieces the top piece and
the<00:00:27.630> bottom<00:00:27.960> piece<00:00:28.730> once<00:00:29.730> you've<00:00:29.880> got<00:00:30.060> those

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
the bottom piece once you've got those

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.550 
the bottom piece once you've got those
two<00:00:30.390> pieces<00:00:30.570> you<00:00:30.779> just<00:00:30.990> turn<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.199> top<00:00:31.349> piece

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
two pieces you just turn the top piece

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.290 
two pieces you just turn the top piece
upside<00:00:31.920> down<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.219> rest<00:00:32.579> it<00:00:32.790> in<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.059> bottom

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
upside down and rest it in the bottom

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.970 
upside down and rest it in the bottom
piece<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:34.260> should<00:00:34.469> fit<00:00:34.649> pretty<00:00:34.860> well

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
piece it should fit pretty well

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.799 
piece it should fit pretty well
depending<00:00:35.520> on<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.730> water<00:00:35.940> bottle<00:00:36.300> some<00:00:36.660> work

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
depending on the water bottle some work

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.260 
depending on the water bottle some work
better<00:00:37.020> than<00:00:37.230> others<00:00:37.320> um<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:38.579> indent<00:00:38.940> at<00:00:39.120> the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
better than others um the indent at the

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.790 
better than others um the indent at the
bottom<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:39.750> really<00:00:40.079> perfect<00:00:40.260> for<00:00:40.469> water

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
bottom is really perfect for water

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.900 
bottom is really perfect for water
drainage<00:00:41.360> so<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.420> put<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.140> soil<00:00:43.379> in<00:00:43.680> here<00:00:43.980> and

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
drainage so you put the soil in here and

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.029 
drainage so you put the soil in here and
then<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.180> plant<00:00:45.420> your<00:00:45.480> seed<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:46.530> rest<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.950> in

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
then you plant your seed you rest it in

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.830 
then you plant your seed you rest it in
here<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.489> whenever<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.910> water<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.270> whatever

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
here and whenever you water it whatever

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.840 
here and whenever you water it whatever
water<00:00:49.140> isn't<00:00:49.440> taken<00:00:49.860> up<00:00:49.950> immediately<00:00:50.219> in<00:00:50.760> the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
water isn't taken up immediately in the

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.180 
water isn't taken up immediately in the
roots<00:00:51.090> or<00:00:51.420> by<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.660> soil<00:00:51.989> will<00:00:52.410> be<00:00:52.590> drained<00:00:52.980> out

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
roots or by the soil will be drained out

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.410 
roots or by the soil will be drained out
into<00:00:53.579> here<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.059> used<00:00:55.020> by<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.260> plant<00:00:55.559> later<00:00:56.420> so

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
into here and used by the plant later so

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.700 
into here and used by the plant later so
I<00:00:57.449> have<00:00:58.579> sunflowers<00:00:59.579> that<00:01:00.300> are<00:01:00.449> getting

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
entire lives um this is this would be a

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.910 
entire lives um this is this would be a
great<00:01:26.939> thing<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.210> do<00:01:27.390> with<00:01:27.509> kids<00:01:27.750> because<00:01:28.470> it

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
with launching something grow and gives

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.600

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
and then it shows them how important it

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.219 
and then it shows them how important it
is<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.750> reuse<00:01:48.750> these<00:01:49.020> things<00:01:49.380> um<00:01:50.869> if<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:52.079> are

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
is to reuse these things um if you are

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.240 
is to reuse these things um if you are
going<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.470> work<00:01:52.590> with<00:01:52.740> kids<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:53.100> would

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
going to work with kids I would

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.490 
going to work with kids I would
recommend<00:01:53.340> filing<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.420> edges<00:01:54.780> after<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.290> cut

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
recommend filing the edges after you cut

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.800 
recommend filing the edges after you cut
the<00:01:55.619> plastic<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:56.189> use<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.460> pair<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.240> scissors<00:01:57.540> but

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
the plastic I use a pair of scissors but

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.539 
the plastic I use a pair of scissors but
even<00:01:58.200> if<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.380> use<00:01:58.530> an<00:01:58.680> exacto<00:01:58.920> knife<00:01:59.219> I'm<00:01:59.369> sure

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
even if you use an exacto knife I'm sure

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.399 
even if you use an exacto knife I'm sure
you're<00:01:59.700> going<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.880> get<00:02:00.000> jagged<00:02:00.360> edges<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:01.259> we

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
you're going to get jagged edges and we
