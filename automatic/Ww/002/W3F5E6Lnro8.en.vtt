00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.140
 hello how about you will see how easy the idea of 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.020
 today that we are going to do with a simple 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.850
 Apple , ideally, be red like 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:17.150
 is that I am using myself or at least 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:19.130
 partially look, I cut a piece 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.980
 a little less than half so you do not 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.420
 include the seeds and I will place it 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.520
 in the center of a plate 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.230
 now with the other piece of apple that 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.550
 I have left over I will do the tweezers 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.290
 crab I cut a piece and I make a 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.720
 triangulito at the bottom of 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.960
 way that simulate a pair of tweezers side two 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.970
 the same will be placed here and I will 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.300
 Cut one end down to fit 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.960
 good with the apple 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.649
 in this way 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.210
 now we keep cutting the apple to 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:54.309
 make a few legs at the bottom 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:58.500
 I cut two pieces as well as two 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.500
 elongated triangles or two rectangles 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.020
 and I'm going to make another leg now 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.659
 back a little more stooped or 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.210
 folded in this way that you are going to see is 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.570
 cut a kind of a better or dv 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.570
 saying 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.610
 do it with a sharp knife and 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.590
 very, very careful not to cut 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.910
 you see what you put on top of 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.690
 the other leg that we had done there 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.650
 down 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.650
 this is how 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.330
 that are more or less the same size 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.330
 the legs 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.450
 now for the eyes the eyes take them 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.820
 to the crab as a kind of 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.500
 antenitas above short two others 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:47.500
 tiny pieces of apple 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.500
 elongated 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.580
 and put them up here in this way 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.710
 now with a black grape if you do not have 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.690
 you can use an olive for example 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.940
 or a little nori seaweed that is black 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.700
 I'm going to cut out two little circles 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:08.170
 that simulate the eyes and placed them on top 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.170
 of this kind of antennas 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.180
 now to use the rest of apple 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.520
 that has left me, I'm just going to 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.670
 cut a few strips by removing a little 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.410
 skin so it looks nicer and I do 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.650
 a kind of soil for the crab 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.490
 beach sand a little to decorate 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.490
 the bottom of the plate 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.700
 I just put it here as if 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.160
 they were bricks 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.459
