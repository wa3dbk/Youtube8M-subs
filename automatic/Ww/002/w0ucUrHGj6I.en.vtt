silhouette of the guitar it sort of

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.249 
silhouette of the guitar it sort of
leads<00:01:34.950> me<00:01:35.159> in<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.340> direction<00:01:35.509> frequently<00:01:36.509> and

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
the the top layer down even more so that

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.960 
the the top layer down even more so that
to<00:04:10.930> make<00:04:11.079> room<00:04:11.439> for<00:04:11.739> the<00:04:11.889> extra<00:04:12.489> thickness<00:04:12.730> of

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
to make room for the extra thickness of

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.539 
to make room for the extra thickness of
the<00:04:13.090> fabric<00:04:13.599> yeah<00:04:14.470> it's<00:04:14.829> really<00:04:15.220> the

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
the fabric yeah it's really the

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:18.270 
the fabric yeah it's really the
finishing<00:04:16.090> time<00:04:16.389> each<00:04:16.840> each<00:04:17.199> time<00:04:17.560> a<00:04:17.590> layer<00:04:17.979> of

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
finishing time each each time a layer of

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.670 
finishing time each each time a layer of
finish<00:04:19.239> is<00:04:19.449> applied<00:04:19.479> it<00:04:19.989> needs<00:04:20.169> to<00:04:20.289> be<00:04:20.410> sanded

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
finish is applied it needs to be sanded

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.469 
finish is applied it needs to be sanded
and<00:04:21.009> prepped<00:04:21.250> for<00:04:21.579> the<00:04:21.669> next<00:04:22.000> layer<00:04:22.210> and

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 
and prepped for the next layer and

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:24.719 
and prepped for the next layer and
sometimes<00:04:23.259> there<00:04:23.470> can<00:04:23.590> be<00:04:23.650> 20<00:04:24.070> or<00:04:24.099> 30<00:04:24.400> layers

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
sometimes there can be 20 or 30 layers

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:27.120 
sometimes there can be 20 or 30 layers
of<00:04:25.030> finish<00:04:25.360> so<00:04:26.020> that<00:04:26.169> really<00:04:26.349> incorporates

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
of finish so that really incorporates

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.089 
of finish so that really incorporates
most<00:04:27.970> of<00:04:28.210> the<00:04:28.300> time<00:04:28.599> that<00:04:29.470> it<00:04:29.620> takes<00:04:29.800> to

00:04:30.089 --> 00:04:30.099 
most of the time that it takes to

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:32.040 
most of the time that it takes to
actually<00:04:30.370> do<00:04:30.699> the<00:04:30.849> finishing<00:04:31.360> work<00:04:31.389> the

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
actually do the finishing work the

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.230 
actually do the finishing work the
design<00:04:32.440> work<00:04:32.650> and<00:04:32.680> everything<00:04:33.070> is<00:04:33.849> well

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
design work and everything is well

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.070 
design work and everything is well
thought<00:04:34.479> out<00:04:34.539> in<00:04:34.780> advance<00:04:35.080> and<00:04:35.680> executed

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
thought out in advance and executed

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.439 
thought out in advance and executed
relatively<00:04:38.080> quickly<00:04:38.410> I<00:04:38.860> don't<00:04:39.310> try<00:04:39.610> and<00:04:39.849> you

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449 
relatively quickly I don't try and you

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:42.749 
relatively quickly I don't try and you
know<00:04:40.479> once<00:04:40.960> i<00:04:41.110> get<00:04:41.259> an<00:04:41.380> idea<00:04:41.740> just<00:04:42.070> go<00:04:42.310> with<00:04:42.520> it

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:42.759 
know once i get an idea just go with it

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:44.760 
know once i get an idea just go with it
and<00:04:42.880> then<00:04:43.360> really<00:04:43.690> the<00:04:43.720> most<00:04:44.229> of<00:04:44.380> the<00:04:44.470> bulk<00:04:44.650> of

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
and then really the most of the bulk of

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.950 
and then really the most of the bulk of
the<00:04:44.860> time<00:04:45.070> is<00:04:45.220> spent<00:04:45.460> finishing<00:04:46.090> it<00:04:46.240> so<00:04:46.720> that

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
the time is spent finishing it so that

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.100 
the time is spent finishing it so that
it<00:04:47.139> just<00:04:47.380> has<00:04:47.530> a<00:04:47.560> perfect<00:04:48.130> fit<00:04:48.340> and<00:04:48.490> finish<00:04:49.110> how

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
it just has a perfect fit and finish how

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.409 
it just has a perfect fit and finish how
much<00:04:50.289> does<00:04:50.440> something<00:04:50.620> like<00:04:50.800> this<00:04:50.949> go<00:04:51.190> for<00:04:51.419> um

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
much does something like this go for um

really<00:05:14.310> like<00:05:14.490> the<00:05:14.670> idea<00:05:14.700> of<00:05:15.060> going<00:05:15.780> right<00:05:16.110> with

this sort of beetle theme and I ran

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.990 
this sort of beetle theme and I ran
across<00:05:18.810> a<00:05:18.930> beautiful<00:05:19.650> vintage<00:05:19.950> street<00:05:20.580> map<00:05:20.790> of

this is all about again putting the

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
fit and finish of this one again it's

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.390 
fit and finish of this one again it's
all<00:05:37.650> about<00:05:37.830> the<00:05:38.010> details<00:05:38.490> the<00:05:39.000> sides<00:05:40.400> we're

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
all about the details the sides we're

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.400 
all about the details the sides we're

around London which takes a good bit of
time<00:05:52.620> once<00:05:53.130> I<00:05:53.220> start<00:05:53.490> working<00:05:53.700> on<00:05:53.970> you<00:05:54.180> know

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
time once I start working on you know

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.370 
time once I start working on you know
multiple<00:05:54.870> sides<00:05:55.110> of<00:05:55.350> the<00:05:55.440> guitar<00:05:55.770> it's<00:05:56.640> really

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:57.380 
multiple sides of the guitar it's really

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:02.180 
multiple sides of the guitar it's really
going<00:05:58.790> going<00:05:59.790> above<00:06:00.030> and<00:06:00.090> beyond<00:06:00.480> the<00:06:01.190> just

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
going going above and beyond the just

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.340 
going going above and beyond the just
working<00:06:02.580> on<00:06:02.700> the<00:06:02.880> the<00:06:03.360> top<00:06:03.570> surface<00:06:03.900> of<00:06:04.230> the

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 
working on the the top surface of the

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.200 
working on the the top surface of the
guitar<00:06:04.740> but<00:06:05.370> again<00:06:05.610> it<00:06:05.760> pulls<00:06:05.940> it<00:06:06.090> all

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 
guitar but again it pulls it all

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.530 
guitar but again it pulls it all
together<00:06:06.500> no<00:06:07.500> it's<00:06:07.740> a<00:06:07.890> visual<00:06:08.100> thing<00:06:08.310> so<00:06:08.820> tying

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:09.540 
together no it's a visual thing so tying

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.180 
together no it's a visual thing so tying
the<00:06:09.690> sides<00:06:09.930> in<00:06:10.140> with<00:06:10.260> the<00:06:10.350> top<00:06:10.590> on<00:06:10.770> this<00:06:10.920> model

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.190 
the sides in with the top on this model

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.790 
the sides in with the top on this model
made<00:06:11.520> perfect<00:06:11.940> sense<00:06:12.000> that's<00:06:12.810> really<00:06:13.050> cool<00:06:13.350> no

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
made perfect sense that's really cool no
