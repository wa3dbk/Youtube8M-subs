00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.820
 completely without sense because he can if 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.950
 the only ever to the boredom one 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.390
 car trip from a to b to bridge 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.649

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.610
 worse traffic than 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.410
 Cyclist I tell you quite simply 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.079
 occupation was me because I car I drive 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.500
 drive yourself but cyclists think 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.090
 you have all the rights of this world and 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.289
 You should be next as a car driver 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.640
 Behave one has quite the 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.649
 ass card a winner for 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.799
 Cyclists around lures then one is in 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.990
 most cases 100% blame the 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.880
 means as much as a cyclist 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.380
 can be quite provocative and quite a bit 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.220
 But save the bib and looked more closely 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.799
 the teacher as me about the 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.780
 Car and the cyclists are doing great 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.250
 you about red traffic lights is the deal 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.259
 shit that just go with the 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.650
 Pedestrians over it is really small 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:28.200
 Counseling by lawyers about cyclists 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.790
 but so i am completely honest and 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.259
 then if they do not come over then 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.640
 just enough why is it all 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.200
 hire cars behind why have that 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.450
 cyclists and moped riders and 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.310
 Motorcyclists right through themselves 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.500
 disconnect just because they fit through it 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.790
 can also try with my car 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.490
 somehow fit through or some 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.899
 frontman broken so I wait inside 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.090
 the gentleman cyclist 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.159
 He then puts himself between all 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.649
 cars through and thaws everyone on the 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.290
 bonnets on top of it and to say you 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.060
 Stands on the edge makes power but yes 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.469
 I'll put it there and I can not 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.170
 just leave because I then in the 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.330
 against traffic but come the case 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.920
 I got upset again for 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.080
 Everyone is like that 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.790
 cyclist per se just like mine 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.700
 car drivers not per se there are synonymous 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.280
 enough fun this but I'm easy 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.319
 To some driver drivers I like that 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.420
 have heard the think they drive 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.400
 armor and in incredible 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.959
 dangerous situation and thus 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.000
 all others endanger the pure 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.530
 advised because then just in front of the car 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.670
 velvet and probably the right of way 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.690
 have taken responsibility because 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.550
 basically actually the 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.900
 Traffic rules somewhere in the breakfast 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:35.870

 Talking de bug in the underground in Cologne
