inches worth you just so you know the

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.190 
inches worth you just so you know the
wire<00:01:14.369> splice<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.909> pinch<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.270> on<00:01:15.420> there<00:01:15.720> and

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
wire splice you pinch it on there and

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.600 
wire splice you pinch it on there and
you<00:01:16.259> have<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.680> extra<00:01:16.890> wire<00:01:17.100> coming<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.490> other

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
you have the extra wire coming the other

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.870 
you have the extra wire coming the other
side<00:01:18.049> and<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.140> was<00:01:19.259> out<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.740> behind<00:01:20.369> all<00:01:20.640> there

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
side and I was out it behind all there

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.899 
side and I was out it behind all there
behind<00:01:21.090> my<00:01:21.299> winch<00:01:21.540> wires<00:01:21.780> all<00:01:22.590> there<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.790> just

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
behind my winch wires all there and just

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.960 
behind my winch wires all there and just
take<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.170> put<00:01:25.229> do<00:01:25.470> ground<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.670> that

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
take it and you put do ground and that

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.399 
take it and you put do ground and that
would<00:01:27.119> do<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.420> get<00:01:27.570> rid<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.930> sputtering

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
would do is get rid of the sputtering

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.050 
would do is get rid of the sputtering
when<00:01:28.530> you're<00:01:28.650> going<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.860> strike<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.939> will

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
when you're going to strike and to will

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.580 
when you're going to strike and to will
draw<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.270> full<00:01:30.570> drive<00:01:30.900> you're<00:01:31.140> stuck<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.439> mud

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
draw a full drive you're stuck in a mud

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.940 
draw a full drive you're stuck in a mud
hole<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.100> now<00:01:32.939> on<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:34.020> keep<00:01:34.320> on<00:01:34.470> giving<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.799> gas

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
hole and now on you keep on giving a gas

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.640 
hole and now on you keep on giving a gas
you<00:01:34.979> get<00:01:35.189> full<00:01:35.490> power<00:01:35.759> reverse<00:01:36.240> now<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:37.049> it

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
you get full power reverse now and it

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.740 
you get full power reverse now and it
only<00:01:37.710> takes<00:01:38.040> about<00:01:38.220> five<00:01:38.400> minutes<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.600> so<00:01:39.689> I

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
only takes about five minutes and so I

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.380 
only takes about five minutes and so I
use<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:39.960> wire<00:01:40.259> splice<00:01:40.530> connector<00:01:41.040> there<00:01:41.390> or

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
use that wire splice connector there or

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.580 
use that wire splice connector there or
you<00:01:42.570> could<00:01:42.720> do<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:42.990> with<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.220> you<00:01:44.220> know<00:01:44.340> blue

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
you could do it with a you know blue

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.399 
you could do it with a you know blue
regular<00:01:46.590> connector<00:01:47.540> so<00:01:48.540> what<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.780> do<00:01:48.930> here<00:01:49.380> is

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
regular connector so what you do here is

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.870 
regular connector so what you do here is
the<00:01:49.590> connector<00:01:49.950> right<00:01:50.070> here

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
the connector right here

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.080 
the connector right here
okay<00:01:52.540> take<00:01:53.229> a<00:01:53.260> piece<00:01:53.470> of<00:01:53.590> wire<00:01:53.770> the<00:01:54.640> green<00:01:54.880> wire

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
okay take a piece of wire the green wire

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.670 
okay take a piece of wire the green wire
comes<00:01:55.479> in<00:01:55.659> this<00:01:55.810> side<00:01:55.990> with<00:01:56.110> the<00:01:56.140> white<00:01:56.350> stripe

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
comes in this side with the white stripe

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.520 
comes in this side with the white stripe
and<00:01:57.009> then<00:01:57.610> on<00:01:57.790> this<00:01:57.909> side<00:01:57.970> you<00:01:58.780> connect<00:01:59.110> it<00:01:59.290> in

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
and then on this side you connect it in

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.520 
and then on this side you connect it in
this<00:01:59.710> wire<00:01:59.950> and<00:02:00.369> then<00:02:01.150> you<00:02:01.420> put<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.470> other

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
this wire and then you put the other

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.770 
this wire and then you put the other
green<00:02:02.860> wire<00:02:03.100> in<00:02:03.430> this<00:02:03.610> side<00:02:03.850> as<00:02:04.090> well<00:02:04.270> so<00:02:04.659> you

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
green wire in this side as well so you

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.649 
green wire in this side as well so you
have<00:02:04.810> one<00:02:05.560> wire<00:02:05.740> coming<00:02:06.040> in<00:02:06.280> two<00:02:06.850> wires<00:02:07.060> coming

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
have one wire coming in two wires coming

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.660 
have one wire coming in two wires coming
out<00:02:07.869> this<00:02:08.140> side<00:02:08.410> and<00:02:08.950> it<00:02:09.250> goes<00:02:09.399> to<00:02:09.580> the

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
out this side and it goes to the

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.070 
out this side and it goes to the
negative<00:02:09.850> battery<00:02:10.450> and<00:02:10.720> the<00:02:10.780> other<00:02:10.899> ones

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
negative battery and the other ones

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.920 
negative battery and the other ones
continues<00:02:11.620> with<00:02:11.950> their<00:02:12.100> wiring<00:02:12.310> harness<00:02:12.930> so

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
continues with their wiring harness so

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.410 
continues with their wiring harness so
now<00:02:14.530> this<00:02:14.739> exercise<00:02:15.010> extra<00:02:15.610> wire<00:02:15.790> here<00:02:16.150> you

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
now this exercise extra wire here you

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.870 
now this exercise extra wire here you
see<00:02:16.650> it's<00:02:17.650> all<00:02:17.800> you<00:02:17.950> really<00:02:18.069> need<00:02:18.310> like<00:02:18.520> 16

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
see it's all you really need like 16

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.570 
see it's all you really need like 16
inches<00:02:19.150> or<00:02:19.270> so<00:02:19.650> after<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.739> longer<00:02:21.130> I<00:02:21.160> cut<00:02:21.489> it

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
inches or so after the longer I cut it

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.790 
inches or so after the longer I cut it
down<00:02:21.610> about<00:02:21.940> 4<00:02:22.239> inches<00:02:22.440> to<00:02:23.440> give<00:02:23.560> you<00:02:23.650> guys<00:02:23.770> a

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
down about 4 inches to give you guys a

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.009 
down about 4 inches to give you guys a
little<00:02:23.980> view<00:02:24.250> so<00:02:24.550> any<00:02:25.239> connector<00:02:25.660> should<00:02:25.690> work

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
little view so any connector should work

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.940 
little view so any connector should work
but<00:02:26.950> uh<00:02:27.010> I<00:02:27.550> just<00:02:27.970> try<00:02:28.150> it<00:02:28.209> out<00:02:28.420> works<00:02:28.810> great<00:02:29.110> you
