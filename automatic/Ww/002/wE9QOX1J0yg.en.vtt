time people are saying it's just going
to<00:00:25.560> match<00:00:25.710> up<00:00:25.949> so<00:00:26.519> if<00:00:26.609> you're<00:00:26.730> saying<00:00:26.939> it's

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
going to beat it so let's go to the

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.490 
going to beat it so let's go to the
specs<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.429> sea<00:00:29.640> but<00:00:30.240> we<00:00:30.720> can<00:00:31.230> determine

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
from that so does it start with the

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.630 
from that so does it start with the
dimensions<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:33.989> Nexus<00:00:34.320> 5<00:00:34.559> so<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.190> Nexus<00:00:35.460> 5

might want to go with the nexus 5

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.679 
might want to go with the nexus 5
because<00:02:29.200> it<00:02:29.439> has<00:02:29.590> a<00:02:29.700> 1<00:02:30.700> inch<00:02:31.030> bigger<00:02:31.359> screen

that's good guys if you really like a
big<00:02:33.459> screen<00:02:33.819> go<00:02:34.180> with<00:02:34.329> the<00:02:34.420> nexus<00:02:34.719> 5<00:02:34.959> in<00:02:35.260> my

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:35.439 
big screen go with the nexus 5 in my

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:38.280 
big screen go with the nexus 5 in my
opinion<00:02:35.799> I<00:02:36.099> think<00:02:36.159> the<00:02:36.579> nexus<00:02:36.909> 5<00:02:37.150> does<00:02:38.019> beat

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
opinion I think the nexus 5 does beat

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.159 
opinion I think the nexus 5 does beat
the<00:02:38.500> iphone<00:02:39.099> 5s<00:02:39.519> in<00:02:39.669> some<00:02:40.030> respects<00:02:40.569> but<00:02:40.689> not

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:41.169 
the iphone 5s in some respects but not

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:45.000 
the iphone 5s in some respects but not
all<00:02:41.349> so<00:02:41.829> dimensions<00:02:42.700> wins<00:02:43.379> display<00:02:44.379> pretty

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
all so dimensions wins display pretty

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.059 
all so dimensions wins display pretty
good<00:02:45.510> operating<00:02:46.510> system<00:02:46.930> it<00:02:47.379> depends<00:02:47.799> on<00:02:47.919> you

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069
