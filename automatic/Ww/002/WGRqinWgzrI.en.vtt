the<00:01:36.280> spikes<00:01:36.700> to<00:01:36.880> protrude<00:01:37.270> so<00:01:37.930> when<00:01:38.080> I

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
the spikes to protrude so when I

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.330 
the spikes to protrude so when I
tenderize<00:01:38.500> this<00:01:38.650> turkey<00:01:38.979> I<00:01:39.010> want<00:01:39.220> them<00:01:39.310> to

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
tenderize this turkey I want them to

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.150 
tenderize this turkey I want them to
protrude<00:01:39.850> about<00:01:40.240> a<00:01:40.270> half<00:01:40.660> an<00:01:40.870> inch<00:01:41.170> and<00:01:41.590> the

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
protrude about a half an inch and the

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.380 
protrude about a half an inch and the
reason<00:01:42.460> we<00:01:42.550> do<00:01:42.670> this<00:01:42.700> is<00:01:42.880> that<00:01:43.120> will<00:01:43.210> poke

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
reason we do this is that will poke

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.910 
reason we do this is that will poke
hundreds<00:01:43.810> of<00:01:43.930> holes<00:01:44.110> in<00:01:44.290> the<00:01:44.320> skin<00:01:44.650> and<00:01:44.860> the

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
hundreds of holes in the skin and the

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.520 
hundreds of holes in the skin and the
flesh<00:01:45.430> rendering<00:01:46.420> the<00:01:46.510> skin<00:01:46.780> even<00:01:46.990> faster

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
flesh rendering the skin even faster

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.860 
flesh rendering the skin even faster
which<00:01:48.100> will<00:01:48.250> make<00:01:48.400> it<00:01:48.430> really<00:01:49.150> crispy<00:01:49.630> and

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
which will make it really crispy and

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.990 
which will make it really crispy and
also<00:01:50.440> it<00:01:50.680> will<00:01:50.860> ensure<00:01:51.190> that<00:01:51.220> all<00:01:51.430> of<00:01:51.580> that<00:01:51.790> rub

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
also it will ensure that all of that rub

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.080 
also it will ensure that all of that rub
is<00:01:52.150> really<00:01:52.570> really<00:01:53.170> absorbed<00:01:53.560> into<00:01:53.710> the<00:01:53.860> meat

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090
