00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.960
 Hi all, from the humble cuisine 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.640
 in this section we can consume more in Ramadan 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.280
 we have a beautiful recipe 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.360
 "Fruity Iftar Dream" 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.360
 but if you want to learn the materials first 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.200
 25 pieces of cherry 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.480
 1 apple 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.040
 1 peach 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.320
 1 piece of banana 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.600
 and 1 tea cup of powdered sugar 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.320
 for custard; 1 liter milk 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.400
 8 tablespoons of powdered sugar 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.720
 3 tablespoons of starch 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.040
 3 tablespoons rice flour 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.360
 1 tablespoon breakfast butter 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.800
 and 1 package of vanilla 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.800
 we now know the ingredients for the fruity iftar dream 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.800
 we can start processing by chopping fruits 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:26.320
 firstly we cut our apples into small cubes 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.680
 We had 1 peach 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.680
 we chop our peach in the same size 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.280
 we chopped peach 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.000
 let the peach be a little raw, not to dissolve 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.160
 we have cherries 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.280
 we removed the nucleus of our cherries with such an apparatus 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.520
 is an economic apparatus that can be found everywhere 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.560
 cherries are divided into several parts 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.880
 we cut the cherries 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.360
 we will not cut the banana 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.840
 let's go to the fire to cook the fruits 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.960
 we put the pot on fire 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.960
 First we add the apple we cut 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.680
 and adding half of the current sugar 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.680
 we cook until irrigated 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.800
 apple watered 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.720
 Since our peach is raw and has the same color as the apple ... 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.200
 now we add the peach 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.200
 and soften until soft 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.480
 peach and apple have softened a lot, now we will take from fire 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.480
 If you remember there were starch in the material list 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.760
 we add little on 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.280
 it will give a jealous expression 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.160
 mixing 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.880
 and we're taking fire now 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.520
 now we add our cherry 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.120
 the remaining half are adding tea cup sugar 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.360
 we cook until a few minutes of water 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.520
 cherries came to our desired consistency 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.800
 likewise adding a small amount of starch 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.920
 we mix and close the fire 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.640
 peaches, apples and cherries 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.600
 We have 6 bowls for 6 people. 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.000
 We sell the fruits 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:24.160
 to leave cherries on top 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.480
 we are now putting our apple and peach mixture 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.640
 we don't want to interfere because colors are different 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.640
 so we roasted separately 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.960
 now we can go by the fire to cook the custard 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.680
 1 liter of cold milk in the pot before leaving the furnace 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.640
 rice flour ... 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.880
 add remaining starch 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.640
 before mixing the sugar 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.640
 rice flour and starch completely confused 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.120
 now add powdered sugar 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.120
 and now we burn the fire 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.640
 we cook until the eye 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.120
 as you can see, our custard has consisted 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:45.880
 Now finally 1 teaspoon of breakfast cereal ... 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.200
 and adding 1 package of vanilla 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.200
 we are mixing 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.800
 and fire 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.520
 our custard has been cooked, we occasionally mix it to cool on one side 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.800
 if you remember we could not chop 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.440
 we will use both raw and not to tarnish 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:14.640
 Now we are cutting the size of apples and peaches 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.080
 and others 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.040
 Now we share it on the other seared fruits 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.880
 Now let's get a little more of the pudding 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.880
 and take the beater 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.720
 let us pour some of our materials on air 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.160
 after the first heat is put in the refrigerator 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.600
 and hold for at least 2 hours, then reverse 

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.600
 2 hours later 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.160
 Fruity iftar dream came out of the fridge 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.880
 we waited 2 hours, for fast cooling 

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.640
 but if you wait one night you will get a better result 

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.640
 now we'll reverse 

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.960
 on a dessert plate 

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.960
 it was a very elegant recipe 

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.480
 Modest Flavors in this part of the kitchen ... 

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.480
 made easy, pleasant to eat, easy to digest ... 

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.200
 we shared a beautiful milky dessert recipe 

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.480
 "Fruity Iftar Dream" 

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.760
 I wish you to try and remember us as soon as possible 

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.720
 Goodbye sir ...
