it's a Manhattan clam chowder on the
stove<00:00:08.220> you<00:00:08.460> see<00:00:08.730> that<00:00:08.910> I'm<00:00:08.970> reheating<00:00:09.540> it<00:00:09.690> in

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
stove you see that I'm reheating it in

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.680 
stove you see that I'm reheating it in
the<00:00:09.900> pot<00:00:10.080> that<00:00:10.110> I<00:00:10.410> made<00:00:10.920> it<00:00:11.070> in<00:00:11.219> I<00:00:11.429> let<00:00:12.420> it<00:00:12.540> sit

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
the pot that I made it in I let it sit

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.350 
the pot that I made it in I let it sit
overnight<00:00:12.719> just<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.290> develop<00:00:13.620> some<00:00:13.740> flavor

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360 
overnight just to develop some flavor

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.630 
overnight just to develop some flavor
the<00:00:15.360> pot<00:00:15.570> behind<00:00:15.900> it<00:00:16.049> is<00:00:16.139> hot<00:00:16.770> water<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.369> I

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
the pot behind it is hot water and I

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.060 
the pot behind it is hot water and I
will<00:00:17.699> be<00:00:17.910> adding<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.680> lids<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:22.070> I'm

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
will be adding the lids to that and I'm

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.220 
will be adding the lids to that and I'm
doing<00:00:23.400> pint-size<00:00:24.029> because<00:00:24.900> it's<00:00:25.050> just

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
doing pint-size because it's just

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.259 
doing pint-size because it's just
perfect<00:00:25.680> for<00:00:25.920> like<00:00:26.189> lunch<00:00:26.490> or<00:00:26.730> dinner<00:00:26.880> and

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:31.849 

it's<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.330> good<00:00:30.480> idea<00:00:30.720> like<00:00:30.840> Chris<00:00:31.380> doesn't<00:00:31.560> like

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
it's a good idea like Chris doesn't like

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.120 
it's a good idea like Chris doesn't like

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
in the basement so let's just jump right

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.930 
in the basement so let's just jump right
in<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.030> get<00:00:51.180> this<00:00:51.270> done<00:00:52.190> yeah<00:00:53.219> once<00:00:53.850> again

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
in and get this done yeah once again

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.880 
in and get this done yeah once again
you're<00:00:54.149> gonna<00:00:54.210> reheat<00:00:54.750> your<00:00:54.989> Manhattan<00:00:55.710> clam

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
you're gonna reheat your Manhattan clam

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.380 
you're gonna reheat your Manhattan clam
chowder<00:00:58.370> now<00:00:59.370> any<00:00:59.640> soups<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.059> contain

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
chowder now any soups that contain

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.920 
chowder now any soups that contain
seafood<00:01:01.020> for<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.070> pint<00:01:02.309> jar<00:01:02.660> you<00:01:03.660> need<00:01:03.809> to

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
seafood for the pint jar you need to

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.240 
seafood for the pint jar you need to
process<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:04.559> for<00:01:04.860> 100<00:01:05.519> minutes<00:01:05.810> so<00:01:07.130> that's<00:01:08.130> a

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
process this for 100 minutes so that's a

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.219 
process this for 100 minutes so that's a
long<00:01:08.460> time<00:01:09.049> that's<00:01:10.049> an<00:01:10.170> hour<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.470> 40<00:01:10.920> minutes

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
long time that's an hour and 40 minutes

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.440 
long time that's an hour and 40 minutes
so<00:01:13.229> my<00:01:13.380> recommendation<00:01:13.970> if<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.060> was<00:01:15.180> gonna<00:01:15.270> do

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
so my recommendation if I was gonna do

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.719 
so my recommendation if I was gonna do
this<00:01:15.570> again<00:01:16.640> you<00:01:18.950> would<00:01:19.950> definitely<00:01:20.130> want<00:01:20.670> to

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
this again you would definitely want to

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.580 
this again you would definitely want to
double<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.270> batch<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.110> clam<00:01:22.290> chowder

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
double the batch of the clam chowder

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.039 
double the batch of the clam chowder
because<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:24.180> know<00:01:24.270> it's<00:01:24.540> you're<00:01:24.750> using<00:01:24.930> a

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
because you you know it's you're using a

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.660 
because you you know it's you're using a
lot<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.170> energy<00:01:25.320> so<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:26.420> would<00:01:27.420> definitely

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
lot of energy so I would definitely

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.980 
lot of energy so I would definitely
double<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.420> pressure<00:01:30.979> canner<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.280> full

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
double it so the pressure canner is full

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.999 
double it so the pressure canner is full
all<00:01:33.990> right<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.259> let's<00:01:34.409> just<00:01:34.470> jump<00:01:34.710> right<00:01:34.829> in

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
all right so let's just jump right in

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.280 
all right so let's just jump right in
here<00:01:35.220> it's<00:01:35.460> what<00:01:35.579> I'm<00:01:35.670> gonna<00:01:35.729> do<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.720> I'm<00:01:37.020> just

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
here it's what I'm gonna do is I'm just

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.950 
here it's what I'm gonna do is I'm just

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
gonna little your chowder into a pint

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.960 
gonna little your chowder into a pint
jar<00:01:43.170> once<00:01:43.560> again<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:44.130> want<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.340> leave<00:01:44.490> an<00:01:44.729> inch

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
jar once again you want to leave an inch

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.810 
jar once again you want to leave an inch
of<00:01:45.149> head<00:01:45.390> space<00:01:46.130> now<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.250> into<00:01:47.430> head<00:01:47.579> space

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
the pressure canner all right I'll do

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.780 
the pressure canner all right I'll do
one<00:03:05.239> more<00:03:05.269> just<00:03:05.660> so<00:03:05.810> people<00:03:06.079> get<00:03:06.170> the<00:03:06.790> rhythm

gonna process this at 10 pounds of

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:39.999 
gonna process this at 10 pounds of
pressure<00:04:34.660> for<00:04:35.660> 100<00:04:36.169> minutes<00:04:38.680> already<00:04:39.680> and

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:40.009 
pressure for 100 minutes already and

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:44.290 
pressure for 100 minutes already and
we'll<00:04:40.699> be<00:04:40.819> back<00:04:42.520> okay<00:04:43.520> the<00:04:43.669> pressure<00:04:43.910> canner

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
we'll be back okay the pressure canner

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:50.740 
we'll be back okay the pressure canner
has<00:04:44.569> invented<00:04:45.009> venting<00:04:46.009> excuse<00:04:46.280> me<00:04:49.509> for<00:04:50.509> 10

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
ok the pressure canner has come down to

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:52.330 
ok the pressure canner has come down to
zero<00:05:47.419> pressure<00:05:47.719> like<00:05:48.680> this<00:05:48.949> now<00:05:49.520> the<00:05:51.340> bolts
