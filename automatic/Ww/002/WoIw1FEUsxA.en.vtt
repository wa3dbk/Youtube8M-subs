nonclassified projects dealing with the
science<00:03:33.400> and<00:03:33.519> technology<00:03:34.150> so<00:03:34.599> we<00:03:35.170> must<00:03:35.439> and

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
science and technology so we must and

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.490 
science and technology so we must and
certainly<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.359> Pentagon<00:03:37.780> is<00:03:37.959> not<00:03:38.109> disclosing

certainly the Pentagon is not disclosing

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.190 
certainly the Pentagon is not disclosing
this<00:03:38.769> information<00:03:38.829> and<00:03:39.670> therefore<00:03:40.030> we<00:03:40.900> must

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
this information and therefore we must

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.879 
this information and therefore we must
so<00:03:42.010> this<00:03:42.280> returns<00:03:42.939> this<00:03:43.329> whole<00:03:43.599> issue<00:03:43.889> perhaps

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:44.889 
so this returns this whole issue perhaps

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:48.000 
so this returns this whole issue perhaps
