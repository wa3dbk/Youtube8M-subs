doing my first playthrough and naive and

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.240 
doing my first playthrough and naive and
close<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:17.910> being<00:00:18.090> done<00:00:18.300> so<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:19.080> in<00:00:20.010> my

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
close to being done so and in my

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.170 
close to being done so and in my
playthrough<00:00:20.760> I<00:00:21.090> am<00:00:21.570> neutral<00:00:21.900> with<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.500> NCR<00:00:23.180> so

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
playthrough I am neutral with the NCR so

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.620 
playthrough I am neutral with the NCR so
I<00:00:24.210> can<00:00:24.480> do<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.769> missions<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:25.980> quest<00:00:26.160> for<00:00:26.400> them

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
I can do the missions and quest for them

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.120 
I can do the missions and quest for them
and<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.960> easiest<00:00:28.260> way<00:00:28.410> it<00:00:28.529> looks<00:00:28.710> like<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:29.010> get

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
and the easiest way it looks like to get

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.700 
and the easiest way it looks like to get
the<00:00:29.220> service<00:00:29.490> rifle<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:30.230> doing<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.320> this<00:00:31.439> way

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
the service rifle is doing it this way

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.020 
the service rifle is doing it this way
so<00:00:32.930> I<00:00:33.930> think<00:00:34.469> I<00:00:34.860> have<00:00:35.070> an<00:00:35.190> idea<00:00:35.430> how<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.670> get<00:00:35.910> it

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
so I think I have an idea how to get it

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.299 
so I think I have an idea how to get it
if<00:00:36.149> you're<00:00:36.329> not<00:00:36.360> neutral<00:00:36.960> with<00:00:37.110> NCR<00:00:37.440> but

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
if you're not neutral with NCR but

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.299 
if you're not neutral with NCR but
that's<00:00:38.460> would<00:00:38.579> be<00:00:38.610> later<00:00:38.850> on<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.180> video<00:00:39.270> and

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
that's would be later on the video and

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:42.950 
that's would be later on the video and
I'm<00:00:41.309> gonna<00:00:41.489> leave<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.000> guys<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.719> do

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
I'm gonna leave it to you guys to do

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.170 
I'm gonna leave it to you guys to do
actually<00:00:43.320> test<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.890> out<00:00:44.040> because<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.610> think<00:00:45.090> it

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
actually test it out because I think it

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.470 
actually test it out because I think it
should<00:00:45.360> work<00:00:45.539> but<00:00:45.809> again<00:00:46.079> I'm<00:00:46.230> not<00:00:46.379> 100%<00:00:47.480> so

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
should work but again I'm not 100% so

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.510 
should work but again I'm not 100% so
first<00:00:48.809> let's<00:00:49.079> do<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.440> NCR<00:00:49.860> way<00:00:50.039> this<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.489> a

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
first let's do it the NCR way this is a

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.869 
first let's do it the NCR way this is a
map<00:00:50.820> showing<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.690> mojave<00:00:52.110> outpost<00:00:52.520> it's<00:00:53.520> in

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
the southwest corner of the map it's

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.790 
the southwest corner of the map it's
very<00:00:59.730> easy<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.120> get<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:01.320> easiest<00:01:01.590> way<00:01:01.770> to

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
very easy to get to the easiest way to

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.690 
very easy to get to the easiest way to
find<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:02.340> place<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.000> look<00:01:03.180> for<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.809> two

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.860 

so<00:05:50.400> now<00:05:50.520> that<00:05:50.580> you've<00:05:50.820> killed<00:05:51.150> all<00:05:51.419> the<00:05:51.659> ants

he'll give you the service rifle no I

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:03.200 
he'll give you the service rifle no I
know<00:05:59.699> he<00:05:59.789> says<00:06:00.000> my<00:06:00.150> thoughts<00:06:00.180> until<00:06:01.050> I<00:06:01.440> get<00:06:02.159> it

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
know he says my thoughts until I get it

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.750 
know he says my thoughts until I get it
so<00:06:03.990> that's<00:06:04.409> the<00:06:04.620> easiest<00:06:05.010> way<00:06:05.220> to<00:06:05.250> get<00:06:05.639> the

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:05.760 
so that's the easiest way to get the

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.600 
so that's the easiest way to get the
service<00:06:06.090> rifle<00:06:06.510> but<00:06:07.110> that<00:06:07.979> requires<00:06:08.370> that

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
service rifle but that requires that

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.670 
service rifle but that requires that
you're<00:06:08.849> neutral<00:06:09.150> with<00:06:09.330> ASEAN<00:06:09.810> now<00:06:10.440> if<00:06:10.560> you're

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
you're neutral with ASEAN now if you're

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.339 
you're neutral with ASEAN now if you're
not<00:06:10.889> neutral<00:06:11.400> with<00:06:11.580> NCR<00:06:11.970> I<00:06:12.330> think<00:06:13.110> there's<00:06:13.289> a

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:13.349 
not neutral with NCR I think there's a

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:21.700 
not neutral with NCR I think there's a
way<00:06:13.530> to<00:06:13.590> get<00:06:13.949> it<00:06:14.039> in<00:06:14.159> prim

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:21.710 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.260 

now<00:06:22.710> again<00:06:22.980> I<00:06:23.040> didn't<00:06:23.490> do<00:06:23.580> this<00:06:23.700> and<00:06:23.940> I<00:06:24.000> haven't

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.270

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:25.760 
now again I didn't do this and I haven't
tested<00:06:24.450> yet<00:06:24.660> but<00:06:25.230> I<00:06:25.260> think<00:06:25.530> it<00:06:25.590> should<00:06:25.740> work

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770 
tested yet but I think it should work

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.200 
tested yet but I think it should work

that Johnson Nash sells is somewhere in

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:38.210 
that Johnson Nash sells is somewhere in

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.300 
I had a video doing it and I'm kind of

him<00:06:48.390> to<00:06:48.540> get<00:06:48.690> it<00:06:48.810> or<00:06:49.050> you<00:06:49.260> could<00:06:49.440> steal<00:06:49.680> it<00:06:49.710> from

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:49.890 
him to get it or you could steal it from
