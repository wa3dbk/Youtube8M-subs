 ok here is the folder 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.520
 well here we can auto look for our 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.900
 folder as you can see is in the 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.250
 desk 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.250
 so here we look for it 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.290
 update it I close it back to 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.160
 open to see if the 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.160
 folder that you just created 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.320
 here is everything we do is the 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:26.690
 scheme we do not select our folder 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:29.610
 we choose the color we will choose a red 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:33.120
 the saturation here we can see the view 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.920
 previous if we want it in another style 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.380
 we just change it here 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:42.710
 classic is typical and modern 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:46.100
 if we want the same constant and then 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.850
 to add all our option we raise 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.010
 in coloring 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.620
 and then list that we can see that it 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.210
 has colored our folder and then if 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.720
 we do not like that color we can 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.820
 change or if they have made an error and 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.920

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.620
