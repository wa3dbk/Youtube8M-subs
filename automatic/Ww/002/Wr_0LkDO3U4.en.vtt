00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
of the character bio I know this isn't

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.640 
of the character bio I know this isn't
really<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.510> big<00:01:09.750> deal<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:10.200> most<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.619> guys

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
really a big deal to most of you guys

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.820 
really a big deal to most of you guys
but<00:01:11.280> from<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:12.119> fan<00:01:12.689> service<00:01:12.960> perspective<00:01:13.350> I

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
but from a fan service perspective I

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.380 
but from a fan service perspective I
think<00:01:14.070> they<00:01:14.159> did<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> great<00:01:14.640> job<00:01:14.670> with<00:01:15.210> this

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
think they did a great job with this

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.960 
think they did a great job with this
because<00:01:15.960> now<00:01:16.409> rather<00:01:16.710> than<00:01:16.860> putting<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.520> a

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
because now rather than putting in a

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.340 
because now rather than putting in a
simple<00:01:18.360> portrait<00:01:18.840> they've<00:01:19.080> actually

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
simple portrait they've actually

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.490 
simple portrait they've actually
integrated<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.759> model<00:01:21.150> viewer<00:01:21.450> into<00:01:22.080> the

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
integrated the model viewer into the

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.990 
integrated the model viewer into the
profile<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.159> don't<00:01:23.369> have<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.700> switch

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
profile so you don't have to switch

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.240 
profile so you don't have to switch
menus<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.810> see<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.080> different<00:01:25.409> colors<00:01:25.740> or<00:01:26.100> to

menus to see the different colors or to

I've<00:04:02.400> transitioned<00:04:02.910> into<00:04:03.300> six<00:04:03.810> different

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
I've transitioned into six different

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.590 
I've transitioned into six different
stages<00:04:04.380> three<00:04:05.190> stages<00:04:05.490> and<00:04:06.090> their<00:04:06.240> alternate

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
stages three stages and their alternate

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.450 
stages three stages and their alternate
counterparts<00:04:07.230> and<00:04:07.440> you<00:04:07.800> can<00:04:07.950> tell<00:04:08.160> how

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:08.460 
counterparts and you can tell how

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.120 
counterparts and you can tell how
similarly<00:04:09.210> they<00:04:09.360> were<00:04:09.420> designed<00:04:09.900> try<00:04:10.440> sell<00:04:10.770> a

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
gameplay isn't that great and that is

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.630 
gameplay isn't that great and that is
because<00:04:24.750> I<00:04:25.320> literally<00:04:25.800> only<00:04:26.040> had<00:04:26.280> about<00:04:26.400> him

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
because I literally only had about him

45<00:04:27.510> minutes<00:04:28.140> to<00:04:28.320> really<00:04:28.530> tweak<00:04:28.800> around<00:04:28.860> with

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
45 minutes to really tweak around with

45 minutes to really tweak around with
this<00:04:29.460> game<00:04:29.730> but<00:04:30.060> honestly<00:04:30.270> if<00:04:30.780> you<00:04:31.020> want<00:04:31.350> to

I've seen of explaining this stuff on me

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.250 
I've seen of explaining this stuff on me
too<00:04:43.350> as<00:04:43.770> far<00:04:44.160> as<00:04:44.190> the<00:04:44.820> fighting<00:04:45.720> screen

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
too as far as the fighting screen

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.380 
too as far as the fighting screen
interface<00:04:46.560> you'll<00:04:47.070> notice<00:04:47.430> now<00:04:47.670> if<00:04:48.180> you

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
haven't been following up on this stuff

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.190 
haven't been following up on this stuff
already<00:04:50.040> that<00:04:50.640> there's<00:04:50.940> a<00:04:51.000> redesign<00:04:51.570> of<00:04:51.810> all

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
already that there's a redesign of all

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.440 
already that there's a redesign of all
the<00:04:52.350> bars<00:04:52.590> your<00:04:53.280> reserve<00:04:53.580> characters<00:04:54.120> are<00:04:54.300> now

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
the bars your reserve characters are now

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.900 
the bars your reserve characters are now
listed<00:04:54.750> above<00:04:55.080> below<00:04:55.710> your<00:04:55.980> main<00:04:56.220> health<00:04:56.580> bar

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
listed above below your main health bar

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.770 
listed above below your main health bar
obviously<00:04:57.750> notated<00:04:58.650> with<00:04:58.680> r1<00:04:59.580> and<00:04:59.790> r2<00:04:59.970> which

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
obviously notated with r1 and r2 which

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.960 
obviously notated with r1 and r2 which
takes<00:05:01.080> a<00:05:01.200> bit<00:05:01.320> of<00:05:01.350> getting<00:05:01.470> used<00:05:01.740> to<00:05:02.250> but<00:05:02.670> it's

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
takes a bit of getting used to but it's

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.140 
takes a bit of getting used to but it's
not<00:05:03.660> as<00:05:03.990> hard<00:05:04.680> to<00:05:05.100> read<00:05:05.400> as<00:05:05.670> I<00:05:05.820> initially

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
not as hard to read as I initially

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.210 
not as hard to read as I initially
thought<00:05:06.420> it<00:05:06.690> would<00:05:06.840> be<00:05:07.050> as<00:05:07.230> you<00:05:07.560> can<00:05:07.740> see<00:05:07.920> the

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
thought it would be as you can see the

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.640 
thought it would be as you can see the
giant<00:05:08.640> koseki<00:05:09.090> sign<00:05:09.390> is<00:05:09.720> pretty<00:05:10.230> much<00:05:10.440> your

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
giant koseki sign is pretty much your

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.250 
giant koseki sign is pretty much your
x-factor<00:05:11.130> gauge<00:05:11.550> so<00:05:12.150> it's<00:05:12.570> a<00:05:12.690> lot<00:05:12.810> easier<00:05:13.050> to

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
x-factor gauge so it's a lot easier to

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.900 
x-factor gauge so it's a lot easier to
know<00:05:13.500> when<00:05:13.740> you<00:05:13.890> have<00:05:14.100> it<00:05:14.130> available<00:05:14.430> in

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
know when you have it available in

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.030 
know when you have it available in

it's not exactly the same game there
have<00:05:19.740> definitely<00:05:19.890> been<00:05:20.550> tweaks<00:05:21.120> to<00:05:21.710> recovery

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
have definitely been tweaks to recovery

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.920 
have definitely been tweaks to recovery
times<00:05:23.010> and<00:05:23.550> what<00:05:23.700> can<00:05:23.850> cancel<00:05:24.240> into<00:05:24.480> what<00:05:24.660> and

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
to play just like you used to but I feel

based<00:05:47.440> on<00:05:47.620> what<00:05:47.890> I<00:05:47.920> have<00:05:48.220> played<00:05:48.550> so<00:05:48.910> far<00:05:48.940> I<00:05:49.480> am

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
based on what I have played so far I am

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.080 
based on what I have played so far I am
definitely<00:05:50.350> looking<00:05:50.380> forward<00:05:50.980> to<00:05:51.250> getting<00:05:52.000> to

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090 
definitely looking forward to getting to

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:54.910 
know dr. strange a bit better especially

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:56.820 
know dr. strange a bit better especially
because<00:05:55.060> he's<00:05:55.390> got<00:05:55.630> that<00:05:55.840> anti<00:05:56.230> projectile

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
because he's got that anti projectile

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.430 
because he's got that anti projectile
counter<00:05:57.520> which<00:05:57.760> will<00:05:58.270> finally<00:05:58.960> give<00:05:59.230> me<00:05:59.410> a

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
counter which will finally give me a

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.850 
counter which will finally give me a
solution<00:05:59.860> to<00:06:00.670> keep<00:06:01.360> away<00:06:01.630> type<00:06:01.960> characters<00:06:02.530> in

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860 
solution to keep away type characters in

solution to keep away type characters in
theory<00:06:03.750> I'll<00:06:04.750> have<00:06:04.990> to<00:06:05.170> experiment<00:06:05.620> with<00:06:05.920> it

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:06.040 
theory I'll have to experiment with it

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.890 
theory I'll have to experiment with it
down<00:06:06.400> the<00:06:06.580> road<00:06:06.760> and<00:06:07.000> see<00:06:07.210> what<00:06:07.420> kind<00:06:07.630> of<00:06:07.690> moves

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:07.900 
down the road and see what kind of moves

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.950 
down the road and see what kind of moves
it<00:06:08.050> will<00:06:08.230> actually<00:06:08.410> counter<00:06:09.690> another<00:06:10.690> cool

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
it will actually counter another cool

it will actually counter another cool

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:15.460 
actually added quite a few character
