to kind of explain one thing you just

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.170 
to kind of explain one thing you just
saw<00:04:41.270> me<00:04:41.300> do<00:04:41.600> partials<00:04:42.350> over<00:04:42.590> here<00:04:42.800> and<00:04:43.730> parcels

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
saw me do partials over here and parcels

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.930 
saw me do partials over here and parcels
over<00:04:44.360> there<00:04:45.070> some<00:04:46.070> people<00:04:46.310> may<00:04:46.490> disagree<00:04:46.610> with

you're<00:04:52.110> doing<00:04:52.320> an<00:04:52.410> exercise<00:04:53.180> and<00:04:54.180> you're

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
you're doing an exercise and you're

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.330 
you're doing an exercise and you're
getting<00:04:55.380> close<00:04:55.560> to<00:04:55.590> failure<00:04:55.950> and<00:04:56.130> then<00:04:56.220> you

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
getting close to failure and then you

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.520 
getting close to failure and then you
fail<00:04:56.550> you<00:04:57.420> say<00:04:57.600> this<00:04:57.780> is<00:04:57.930> your<00:04:58.050> fail<00:04:58.230> point

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
fail you say this is your fail point

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.710 
fail you say this is your fail point
come<00:04:58.650> a<00:04:58.680> little<00:04:58.800> closer<00:04:59.330> say<00:05:00.330> this<00:05:00.480> is<00:05:00.600> your

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
come a little closer say this is your

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.550 
come a little closer say this is your
cell<00:05:00.900> point<00:05:01.520> if<00:05:02.520> you<00:05:02.790> stopped<00:05:03.150> here<00:05:03.630> that's

cell point if you stopped here that's

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.620 
cell point if you stopped here that's
technically<00:05:05.130> failure<00:05:05.580> in<00:05:05.730> that<00:05:05.880> you<00:05:06.390> would<00:05:06.510> be

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
technically failure in that you would be

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.110 
technically failure in that you would be

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.530 
correct but on a single joint exercise
you<00:05:10.050> have<00:05:10.200> the<00:05:10.350> luxury<00:05:10.560> of<00:05:10.770> going<00:05:10.920> to<00:05:11.130> failure

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
you have the luxury of going to failure

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.980 
you have the luxury of going to failure

you<00:05:32.130> think<00:05:32.390> why<00:05:33.740> allow<00:05:34.740> just<00:05:35.190> the<00:05:35.280> muscle

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
you think why allow just the muscle

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.910 
you think why allow just the muscle

salute<00:05:44.520> failure<00:05:44.880> especially<00:05:45.510> when<00:05:45.960> you're

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
salute failure especially when you're

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.900 
salute failure especially when you're
only<00:05:46.170> doing<00:05:46.350> one<00:05:46.620> second<00:05:47.010> that's<00:05:47.640> the<00:05:47.760> whole

only doing one second that's the whole

point in doing one second so that you

point in doing one second so that you
fry<00:05:50.100> that's<00:05:50.400> that<00:05:50.730> muscle<00:05:51.060> every<00:05:51.180> time<00:05:51.510> that

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
fry that's that muscle every time that

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.290 
fry that's that muscle every time that
you<00:05:52.470> go<00:05:52.590> to<00:05:52.620> failure<00:05:53.010> you<00:05:53.730> feel<00:05:53.970> like<00:05:54.150> after

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
you go to failure you feel like after

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.420 
you go to failure you feel like after
your<00:05:54.540> first<00:05:54.720> set<00:05:55.020> it<00:05:55.800> feels<00:05:56.010> like<00:05:56.160> it's<00:05:56.310> your

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
your first set it feels like it's your

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.320 
your first set it feels like it's your
last<00:05:56.840> stay<00:05:57.840> tuned<00:05:58.050> for<00:05:58.230> more
