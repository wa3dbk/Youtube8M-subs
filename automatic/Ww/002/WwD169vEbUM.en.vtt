aka multitasking is crucial in my life
so<00:02:13.989> that's<00:02:14.170> why<00:02:14.350> this<00:02:15.130> is<00:02:15.190> a<00:02:15.400> big<00:02:16.270> contender<00:02:16.959> in

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
so that's why this is a big contender in

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.130 
so that's why this is a big contender in
the<00:02:17.620> moisturizer<00:02:18.190> arena<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.660> night<00:02:19.840> cream

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
the moisturizer arena the night cream

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.920 
the moisturizer arena the night cream
was<00:02:20.860> also<00:02:21.280> good<00:02:21.550> I<00:02:21.880> liked<00:02:22.569> it<00:02:22.660> because<00:02:22.750> it<00:02:22.840> was

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
was also good I liked it because it was

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.330 
was also good I liked it because it was
super<00:02:23.110> nourishing<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:23.709> only<00:02:23.890> thing<00:02:24.069> is<00:02:24.190> that

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
super nourishing the only thing is that

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.600 
super nourishing the only thing is that
you're<00:02:25.060> a<00:02:25.180> lazy<00:02:25.480> person<00:02:25.900> and<00:02:26.410> I<00:02:27.310> don't<00:02:27.430> even

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
you're a lazy person and I don't even

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.280 
you're a lazy person and I don't even
take<00:02:27.880> my<00:02:28.030> makeup<00:02:28.360> off<00:02:28.510> at<00:02:28.690> night<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.110> I<00:02:29.260> know

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
take my makeup off at night and I know

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.740 
take my makeup off at night and I know
everybody's<00:02:29.890> like<00:02:30.010> oh<00:02:30.130> you<00:02:30.760> should<00:02:31.120> do<00:02:31.569> that

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
everybody's like oh you should do that

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.309 
everybody's like oh you should do that
but<00:02:32.230> I<00:02:32.260> don't<00:02:32.410> and<00:02:32.890> so<00:02:33.700> I<00:02:33.730> certainly<00:02:34.180> don't<00:02:34.959> put

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
but I don't and so I certainly don't put

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.050 
but I don't and so I certainly don't put
a<00:02:35.350> night<00:02:35.560> cream<00:02:35.769> on<00:02:35.890> but<00:02:36.069> am<00:02:36.130> I<00:02:36.220> start<00:02:36.580> here<00:02:37.000> we

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
a night cream on but am I start here we

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.490 
a night cream on but am I start here we
go<00:02:37.180> I<00:02:37.209> got<00:02:37.330> a<00:02:37.450> really<00:02:37.630> good<00:02:37.810> quality<00:02:38.170> one<00:02:38.290> so<00:02:38.440> I

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
go I got a really good quality one so I

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.699 
go I got a really good quality one so I
might<00:02:38.530> just<00:02:38.860> start<00:02:38.950> doing<00:02:39.250> that<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.760> only

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
might just start doing that the only

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.620 
might just start doing that the only
potential<00:02:41.709> downside<00:02:42.640> is<00:02:43.000> just<00:02:43.330> that<00:02:43.450> the

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
potential downside is just that the

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.080 
potential downside is just that the
scrub<00:02:44.530> is<00:02:44.560> supposed<00:02:45.010> to<00:02:45.100> be<00:02:45.250> a<00:02:45.280> daily<00:02:45.580> scrub

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
scrub is supposed to be a daily scrub

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.620 
scrub is supposed to be a daily scrub
and<00:02:46.360> it's<00:02:47.280> does<00:02:48.280> a<00:02:48.310> really<00:02:48.760> good<00:02:49.120> job<00:02:49.390> at

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
and it's does a really good job at

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.479 
and it's does a really good job at
removing<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:50.170> oils<00:02:50.500> and<00:02:50.769> so<00:02:50.950> I<00:02:51.220> wouldn't

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
removing the oils and so I wouldn't

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.250 
removing the oils and so I wouldn't
recommend<00:02:51.640> it<00:02:52.030> for<00:02:52.060> every<00:02:52.480> day<00:02:52.660> I<00:02:52.690> have<00:02:52.989> really

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
recommend it for every day I have really

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.190 
recommend it for every day I have really
dry<00:02:53.380> skin<00:02:53.500> anyway<00:02:54.010> so<00:02:54.069> um<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:55.569> idea<00:02:55.630> of<00:02:55.900> just

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
dry skin anyway so um the idea of just

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.140 
dry skin anyway so um the idea of just
like<00:02:56.350> pulling<00:02:56.799> oils<00:02:57.160> out<00:02:57.430> of<00:02:57.580> my<00:02:57.670> face<00:02:57.880> just

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
like pulling oils out of my face just

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.500 
like pulling oils out of my face just
doesn't<00:02:58.569> work<00:02:58.630> my<00:02:58.959> overall<00:02:59.319> advice<00:02:59.500> to<00:03:00.040> you<00:03:00.220> is

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
doesn't work my overall advice to you is

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.080 
doesn't work my overall advice to you is
try<00:03:01.510> everything<00:03:01.810> try<00:03:02.440> everything<00:03:02.739> once<00:03:03.090> but

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
try everything try everything once but

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.340 
try everything try everything once but
when<00:03:04.209> you<00:03:04.299> find<00:03:04.510> something<00:03:04.690> that<00:03:04.780> works<00:03:04.870> stick

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
when you find something that works stick

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.680 
when you find something that works stick
with<00:03:05.530> it<00:03:05.680> because<00:03:06.150> face<00:03:07.150> skin<00:03:07.360> is<00:03:07.510> really

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
with it because face skin is really

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.650 
with it because face skin is really
fickle<00:03:08.019> and<00:03:08.320> it's<00:03:09.250> stubborn<00:03:09.579> to<00:03:09.880> change<00:03:10.180> and

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
fickle and it's stubborn to change and

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.690 
fickle and it's stubborn to change and
so<00:03:10.750> I<00:03:10.780> don't<00:03:11.019> recommend<00:03:11.500> using<00:03:11.739> multiple

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
so I don't recommend using multiple

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.130 
so I don't recommend using multiple
multiple<00:03:12.910> different<00:03:13.209> products<00:03:13.780> and<00:03:13.930> trying

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
multiple different products and trying

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.370 
multiple different products and trying
lots<00:03:14.290> of<00:03:14.500> stuff<00:03:14.769> as<00:03:15.010> if<00:03:15.190> that's<00:03:15.820> your<00:03:16.090> regime<00:03:16.380> I

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
lots of stuff as if that's your regime I

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.630 
lots of stuff as if that's your regime I
think<00:03:17.709> you<00:03:17.950> should<00:03:18.100> stick<00:03:18.280> with<00:03:18.310> something

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
think you should stick with something

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.460 
think you should stick with something
and<00:03:18.790> just<00:03:18.820> be<00:03:19.060> aware<00:03:19.180> that<00:03:19.390> what<00:03:19.930> works<00:03:20.170> for
