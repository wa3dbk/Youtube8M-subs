00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
return serve but what we're really

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.220 
return serve but what we're really
looking<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.340> do<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.699> hit<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.939> kick<00:00:30.269> serve<00:00:30.570> out

get<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.840> picture<00:01:58.439> of<00:01:58.740> Mark<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.250> he<00:01:59.430> turned

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
get that picture of Mark that he turned

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.300 
get that picture of Mark that he turned
his<00:02:00.060> back<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.360> me<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:01.020> therefore<00:02:01.829> doesn't

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
his back to me and therefore doesn't

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.880 
his back to me and therefore doesn't
know<00:02:02.700> where<00:02:02.939> I<00:02:02.969> am<00:02:03.170> okay<00:02:04.170> so<00:02:04.229> guys<00:02:04.619> I'm<00:02:04.770> going

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
know where I am okay so guys I'm going

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.580 
know where I am okay so guys I'm going
to<00:02:04.950> get<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.219> kick<00:02:05.520> serve<00:02:05.759> out<00:02:06.750> wide<00:02:07.229> and

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
to get that kick serve out wide and

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.130 
to get that kick serve out wide and
right<00:02:08.280> there<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.640> saw<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.270> picture<00:02:09.569> of<00:02:09.869> Mark

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
right there I saw that picture of Mark

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.440 
right there I saw that picture of Mark
where<00:02:10.379> his<00:02:10.530> backs<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:11.160> me<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:12.120> would<00:02:12.270> be<00:02:12.330> a

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
where his backs to me that would be a

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
where his backs to me that would be a
great<00:02:12.840> example

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
great example

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.200 
great example
of<00:02:13.500> a<00:02:13.620> time<00:02:13.890> where<00:02:14.190> now<00:02:14.340> I'm<00:02:14.490> going<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.730> kick<00:02:14.970> my

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
of a time where now I'm going to kick my

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.080 
of a time where now I'm going to kick my
feet<00:02:15.240> into<00:02:15.780> gear<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.260> get<00:02:17.190> moving<00:02:17.250> here<00:02:17.790> okay

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
feet into gear and get moving here okay

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.790 
feet into gear and get moving here okay
so<00:02:18.150> let's<00:02:18.540> see<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.870> play<00:02:19.110> in<00:02:19.230> its<00:02:19.380> entirety

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
so let's see the play in its entirety

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.220 
so let's see the play in its entirety
this<00:02:20.640> is<00:02:20.850> what<00:02:21.030> we<00:02:21.150> call<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.990> kick<00:02:22.200> and

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
this is what we call the the kick and

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:33.350 
this is what we call the the kick and
close<00:02:31.010> all<00:02:32.010> right<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.490> that<00:02:32.910> worked<00:02:33.180> out

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
close all right and that worked out

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.990 
close all right and that worked out
great<00:02:33.630> I<00:02:34.020> was<00:02:34.620> probably<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:35.100> little<00:02:35.190> bit<00:02:35.670> quick

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
great I was probably a little bit quick

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.550 
great I was probably a little bit quick
coming<00:02:36.330> off<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.660> line<00:02:36.810> because<00:02:37.050> I<00:02:37.230> knew<00:02:37.410> we

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
coming off the line because I knew we

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.190 
coming off the line because I knew we
wanted<00:02:37.710> to<00:02:38.090> to<00:02:39.090> show<00:02:39.300> you<00:02:39.360> guys<00:02:39.480> that<00:02:39.660> play<00:02:40.140> but

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
wanted to to show you guys that play but

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.310 
wanted to to show you guys that play but
try<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:40.680> have<00:02:40.950> that<00:02:41.510> split<00:02:42.510> second<00:02:43.050> pause

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
try to have that split second pause

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.640 
try to have that split second pause
where<00:02:43.740> you<00:02:43.860> guys<00:02:44.070> are<00:02:44.310> really<00:02:44.690> able<00:02:45.690> to<00:02:46.170> see

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
where you guys are really able to see

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.550 
where you guys are really able to see
you<00:02:47.430> know<00:02:47.550> what<00:02:48.390> your<00:02:48.540> opponent's<00:02:49.050> showing<00:02:49.440> in

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
you know what your opponent's showing in

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.650 
you know what your opponent's showing in
terms<00:02:49.830> of<00:02:50.010> stroke<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:51.420> great<00:02:51.630> thing

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
terms of stroke and the great thing

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.360 
terms of stroke and the great thing
about<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.200> kick<00:02:52.410> serve<00:02:52.650> because<00:02:52.890> it<00:02:53.190> goes

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
about the kick serve because it goes

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.330 
about the kick serve because it goes
high<00:02:53.670> and<00:02:53.700> it's<00:02:54.140> obviously<00:02:55.140> slower<00:02:55.709> than<00:02:56.070> say

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
high and it's obviously slower than say

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.050 
high and it's obviously slower than say
a<00:02:56.370> flat<00:02:56.760> serve<00:02:57.800> you<00:02:58.800> know<00:02:58.920> it<00:02:59.190> gives<00:02:59.760> you<00:02:59.940> the

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
a flat serve you know it gives you the

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.330 
a flat serve you know it gives you the
time<00:03:00.420> to<00:03:00.780> be<00:03:00.930> able<00:03:01.050> to<00:03:01.320> decipher<00:03:01.740> what<00:03:02.190> the

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
time to be able to decipher what the

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.430 
time to be able to decipher what the
opponent's<00:03:02.820> doing<00:03:03.120> if<00:03:03.270> I<00:03:03.390> try<00:03:03.690> that<00:03:03.720> play<00:03:04.200> with

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
opponent's doing if I try that play with

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.770 
opponent's doing if I try that play with
a<00:03:04.470> flat<00:03:04.800> serve<00:03:05.130> in<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.400> ball<00:03:05.580> gets<00:03:06.390> on<00:03:06.600> my

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
a flat serve in the ball gets on my

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.290 
a flat serve in the ball gets on my
opponent<00:03:07.290> in<00:03:07.440> an<00:03:07.590> instant<00:03:08.120> there's<00:03:09.120> not

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
opponent in an instant there's not

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.710 
opponent in an instant there's not
really<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.840> time<00:03:10.140> to<00:03:10.250> judge<00:03:11.300> you<00:03:12.300> know<00:03:12.420> what

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
really the time to judge you know what

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.390 
really the time to judge you know what
they're<00:03:12.930> showing<00:03:12.959> me<00:03:13.380> in<00:03:13.590> terms<00:03:13.830> of<00:03:14.040> stroke

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
they're showing me in terms of stroke

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.440 
they're showing me in terms of stroke
okay<00:03:14.959> so<00:03:15.959> go<00:03:16.110> out<00:03:16.140> try<00:03:16.590> to<00:03:16.620> kick<00:03:16.950> and<00:03:17.130> close

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
okay so go out try to kick and close

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.640

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.490 
again for all you players that don't
necessarily<00:03:19.890> have<00:03:20.550> a<00:03:20.610> great<00:03:20.910> kick<00:03:21.230> still<00:03:22.230> try

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
necessarily have a great kick still try

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.520 
necessarily have a great kick still try
that<00:03:22.709> that's<00:03:23.269> that<00:03:24.269> play<00:03:24.510> with<00:03:24.690> a<00:03:24.720> slice<00:03:25.170> serve

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.979 
that that's that play with a slice serve
that<00:03:25.860> maybe<00:03:26.100> sits<00:03:26.519> up<00:03:26.730> a<00:03:26.880> little<00:03:27.120> bit<00:03:27.269> just

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
that maybe sits up a little bit just

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.110 
that maybe sits up a little bit just
something<00:03:28.410> that<00:03:28.560> gets<00:03:28.709> out<00:03:28.950> wide<00:03:29.310> and<00:03:29.340> gives

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.790 
something that gets out wide and gives
you<00:03:30.269> a<00:03:30.300> little<00:03:30.510> more<00:03:30.630> time<00:03:31.080> to<00:03:31.110> judge<00:03:31.560> your

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800
