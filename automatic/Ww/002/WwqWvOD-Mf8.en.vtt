00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:03.610
 Hello my name is Hannes Ackermann I am 19 years old from Marcelo Bordon 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.210
 I am professional motocross freestyle on 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.450
 and last year and in Rhodes year the German championship in the 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.450
 Become freestyle motocross 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:16.860
 this year 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.150
 for the third time the Germans 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.419
 Polo Freestyle Championship held 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:24.309
 but that's the way it is, new tricks have been learned as it was 

00:00:24.309 --> 00:00:25.210
 should 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.669
 and also the track have been backups 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:28.780
 what landings 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.780
 Directions have made 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.890
 to further assist the wizardry and title sponsor 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.240
 the polo 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.580
 That's why Percent also wears the German Freestyle Championships 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.660
 Polo Freestyle Championship 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.460
 as the main sponsor which contributes 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.460
 to support the series and Walter Hans Brei 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.380
 so far there is a premiere 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.200
 since the term of the championship 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.020
 takes place in the ring-arena at the NÃ¼rburgring 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.740
 that means a running event 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.630
 which is very different for the driver holder so for me 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.160
 no problem the same is used that that time to jump in there 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.670
 But for the beginners, it may be a bit more difficult 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.930
 optical aspect 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.330
 usually there are benefits because you 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.670
 in an arena 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.670
 has not been investigated is not in the winter resort 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.450
 So personally, I'm building their resident at home level where you come from 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.730
 but one built a route 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.700
 a landing is a role model in the judges available 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.170
 I will continue 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.650
 effectively prepare for it 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.960
 because the German team to hear again 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.580
 So I would be happy if you influenced the German Polo 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.970
 To see freestyle championship
