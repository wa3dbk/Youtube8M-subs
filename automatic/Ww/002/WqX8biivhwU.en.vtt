hello<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.250> then<00:01:47.790> you're<00:01:48.030> probably<00:01:48.240> trying<00:01:48.570> to

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
hello and then you're probably trying to

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.270

turn<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.140> volume<00:01:49.530> down<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:49.979> case<00:01:50.130> she's

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
turn the volume down so in case she's

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.560 
turn the volume down so in case she's
yelling<00:01:50.610> at<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.790> nobody<00:01:51.060> else<00:01:51.119> can<00:01:51.270> hear<00:01:51.450> you

through<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.780> phone<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.170> then<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.070> turns<00:01:53.280> into

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
through the phone and then it turns into

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.760 
through the phone and then it turns into
probably<00:01:53.850> German<00:01:54.329> speaking<00:01:54.630> at<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.619> end

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770
