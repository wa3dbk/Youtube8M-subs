00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:17.340
 It was here, people are saying, what are you talking about? 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.259
 - welcome everyone to another video 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.990
 and in today's video I would like to bring 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:24.840
 for you again a gameplay of m2 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.079
 playing on completely different map 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.540
 people look at the crazy map faces 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:33.750
 take tying play module was 2 on pc 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:36.239
 and also was 4 contains bought four 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.250
 With the pc it 's very cool I'm loving it 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.440
 play because of those situations in which 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.690
 are completely different things right 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.109
 you can see the name of this map that 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.660
 call the ring is his translation on foot 

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:51.600
 to the letter would not be the platform 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.789
 oil and really is a platform for 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.800
 oil map is small single 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.929
 let's say let's face it as soon as he 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.969
 at night a little bad to see still 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:03.600
 more in the uniform of some of the ones 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.220
 characters is the black outfit then it ends 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.110
 making it difficult to see 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.250
 identifying them but taking this 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.860
 I think it's cool. 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.440
 the design on the map was really cool 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.720
 map that I 'm not sure why it does 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.400
 long time not playing the engine was 2 and 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.290
 especially the campaign mode that I only 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.180
 I played once to get to the end and 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.890
 I never played again, but if I do not 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.510
 mistake the module campaign mode was 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.130
 two have a stage that is a platform 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.370
 of oil 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.930
 so I can're confusing can 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.670
 I'm talking nonsense but I think it's 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.570
 an oil platform in the 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.240
 campaign and they end up using this 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.210
 camouflage texture mode map design 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.430
 finally the phase of the campaign mode and finished 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.980
 adapting tremendously pro multiplayer mode 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.960
 and I confess the province was very legal. 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.970
 original map of this one would be well 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.470
 interesting for the game I think the 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.230
 infinity ward could bring 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.440
 tranquilly this map promotes the fair 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:01.170
 two that would be very well accepted is legal 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.540
 is the size of it is not a big map 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.550
 small is greater than the name - calling and 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.170
 bigger than the chip let 's say so it's 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.950
 ranch size more or less 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.019
 thing like that 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.630
 I found his design very nice, did you? 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:14.280
 who can enter through the other side 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.960
 There's this guy who's going to kill a sniper. 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.910
 You can climb it too. 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.220
 very interesting points and I'm enjoying it 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.470
 much play module was 2 on the third of 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.820
 cause of these modifications 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.970
 I have already brought you a video 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.710
 previous playing map in the yard 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.690
 in module was 2 in the galera is over 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.120
 enjoying quite so thank you and 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.370
 and I'm very happy that you 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.590
 They ended up enjoying that video and now 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.150
 a new map where she has many 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.220
 other different maps I want to see if 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.550
 as far as possible I can bring 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.260
 these game place and me process maps 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.400
 I think you're going to like it a lot 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.680
 same 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.540
 good starting is almost there 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.330
 that end up leaving this match 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.030
 completely because I ended up dying 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.740
 sometimes silly so had a 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.800
 guy who was wearing the radio but also 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.990
 Finally I think he died soon ended 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.140
 Leaving was clicked now I do not have 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:09.420
 certainty and from which one arrives at 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.400
 I ended up being that every one of the health 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.690
 ses will be able to follow here I do not 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.570
 I'm sure right. 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.400
 but I believe that as the opponent 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.440
 I was almost coming in from sniper 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.410
 I think I could only sniper more type 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.780
 did not say anything on the server that it was 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.640
 sniper so I ended up playing the mp 45 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.830
 which is a very good weapon even for 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.750
 You play when you 're led on 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.940
 Connection may be with legging type 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.190
 Well, high cars that started you. 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.420
 can play super well so the 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.700
 people are going to get here the part that I 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.160
 I was bitten from the room I hope you are 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.890
 enjoying the move was the full map 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.110
 ring and we see each other in the next video 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.820
 Then it will be soon promises tomorrow. 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.790
 I'll be with my goal that way. 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.860
 Good floor, I think I guess. 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.230
 that will be all right but anyway if not 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.880
 on Thursday or Wednesday 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.170
 have video the guardian outside felt then 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.660
 Thank you so much. 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.970
 company and we see each other in 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:06.890
 until the video is still there with the 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.890
 player to stay in that hacker
