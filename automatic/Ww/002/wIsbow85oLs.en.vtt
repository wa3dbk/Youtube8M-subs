00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
fingertips with this printer on the

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.140 
fingertips with this printer on the
front<00:00:23.189> you're<00:00:23.340> going<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.550> see<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.699> two<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.090> a

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
all the options you could really need to

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.929

access<00:00:28.740> from<00:00:28.920> that<00:00:28.980> screen<00:00:29.369> from<00:00:29.609> maintenance

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
access from that screen from maintenance

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.939 
access from that screen from maintenance
to<00:00:30.300> scans<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:31.170> pretty<00:00:31.349> much<00:00:31.439> anything<00:00:31.740> you

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
to scans to pretty much anything you

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.830 
to scans to pretty much anything you
need<00:00:32.219> but<00:00:32.880> keep<00:00:33.090> in<00:00:33.210> mind<00:00:33.239> that<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.600> screen

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840

need but keep in mind that the screen
isn't<00:00:34.050> touchscreen<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:34.860> this<00:00:35.040> printer<00:00:35.309> it

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
isn't touchscreen and this printer it

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.340 
isn't touchscreen and this printer it
really<00:00:35.579> doesn't<00:00:35.850> have<00:00:35.969> any<00:00:36.180> frills<00:00:36.600> if<00:00:36.960> you're

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
looking for that it pretty much just

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.520 
looking for that it pretty much just
gets<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.300> job<00:00:39.510> done<00:00:39.570> when<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.140> need<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.440> to

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
everything like that the printing is

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.590

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
really fast and great quality but you're

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.940 
really fast and great quality but you're
gonna<00:01:09.689> want<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.900> keep<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.200> mind<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.650> type<00:01:10.830> of

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
gonna want to keep in mind the type of

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.770 
gonna want to keep in mind the type of
ink<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.549> type<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.760> paper<00:01:12.030> using<00:01:12.600> will

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
ink and the type of paper using will

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.660 
ink and the type of paper using will
contribute<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.530> quality<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:14.400> keep<00:01:14.549> that

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
contribute to the quality so keep that

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.210 
contribute to the quality so keep that
in<00:01:14.729> mind<00:01:14.820> also<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:16.229> only<00:01:16.350> real<00:01:16.680> problem<00:01:17.130> I

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
in mind also the only real problem I

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.890 
in mind also the only real problem I
have<00:01:17.369> when<00:01:17.580> printing<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.479> when<00:01:18.810> the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
have when printing is that when the

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.600 
have when printing is that when the
printer<00:01:19.140> was<00:01:19.229> in<00:01:19.409> its<00:01:19.530> low-power<00:01:20.040> state<00:01:20.400> it

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
printer was in its low-power state it

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.550 
printer was in its low-power state it
seems<00:01:21.119> like<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.479> took<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.869> minute<00:01:22.020> or<00:01:22.259> two<00:01:22.409> to

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
seems like it took a minute or two to

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.170 
seems like it took a minute or two to
actually<00:01:22.830> print<00:01:23.009> out<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.250> document<00:01:23.400> but<00:01:24.060> when

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
actually print out the document but when

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.390 
actually print out the document but when
it<00:01:24.330> was<00:01:24.479> in<00:01:24.659> bold<00:01:25.080> power<00:01:25.320> state<00:01:25.710> then<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.159> took

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
it was in bold power state then it took

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.890 
it was in bold power state then it took
just<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.790> few<00:01:26.820> seconds<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.479> print<00:01:27.720> everything

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:02.370 
the only real problem I have with the
printer<00:02:00.850> was<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.390> scanner<00:02:01.720> because<00:02:02.049> when<00:02:02.290> you

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
printer was the scanner because when you

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.109 
printer was the scanner because when you
put<00:02:02.530> the<00:02:02.590> scanner<00:02:02.829> up<00:02:03.070> the<00:02:03.460> hinges<00:02:03.880> just

put the scanner up the hinges just
didn't<00:02:04.659> seem<00:02:04.810> to<00:02:04.990> hold<00:02:05.229> the<00:02:05.409> scanner<00:02:05.680> up<00:02:05.920> so<00:02:06.520> if

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
didn't seem to hold the scanner up so if

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.249 
didn't seem to hold the scanner up so if
you<00:02:06.670> just<00:02:06.909> touched<00:02:07.270> it<00:02:07.479> while<00:02:07.720> it<00:02:07.840> was<00:02:07.930> up<00:02:08.080> and

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259
