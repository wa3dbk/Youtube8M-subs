muscles<00:03:44.490> so<00:03:45.300> obviously<00:03:45.780> isolated<00:03:46.470> so<00:03:46.590> you're

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
muscles so obviously isolated so you're

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.370 
muscles so obviously isolated so you're
working<00:03:46.830> one<00:03:47.250> one<00:03:48.000> side<00:03:48.300> at<00:03:48.570> a<00:03:48.600> time<00:03:48.690> so<00:03:49.320> you

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
working one one side at a time so you

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.160 
working one one side at a time so you
can<00:03:49.860> focus<00:03:50.040> on<00:03:50.580> different<00:03:50.820> strengths<00:03:51.420> once<00:03:52.020> I

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
can focus on different strengths once I

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.450 
can focus on different strengths once I
was<00:03:52.290> weaker<00:03:52.470> than<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.830> other<00:03:52.950> then<00:03:53.250> you<00:03:53.310> can

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.460 
was weaker than the other then you can

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.730 
was weaker than the other then you can
add<00:03:53.640> weight<00:03:53.940> accordingly<00:03:54.620> obviously<00:03:55.620> you

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
add weight accordingly obviously you

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.860 
add weight accordingly obviously you
don't<00:03:55.950> want<00:03:56.130> to<00:03:56.220> build<00:03:57.060> one<00:03:57.270> side<00:03:57.480> bigger<00:03:57.690> than

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
don't want to build one side bigger than

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.050 
don't want to build one side bigger than
the<00:03:57.960> other<00:03:57.990> so<00:03:58.410> this<00:03:58.620> is<00:03:58.650> really<00:03:59.070> good<00:03:59.370> too<00:03:59.550> to
