00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.440 
you can do stuff in this game that you
probably<00:03:14.320> can't<00:03:14.770> do<00:03:15.010> you<00:03:15.580> know<00:03:15.700> in<00:03:16.000> a<00:03:16.180> lot<00:03:16.390> of

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
probably can't do you know in a lot of

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.170 
probably can't do you know in a lot of
other<00:03:16.690> games<00:03:16.959> and<00:03:17.290> that<00:03:17.410> is<00:03:17.470> a<00:03:17.500> great<00:03:17.739> example

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
other games and that is a great example

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.310 
other games and that is a great example
just<00:03:19.180> jumping<00:03:19.570> off<00:03:19.660> buildings<00:03:19.840> like<00:03:20.170> that

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
just jumping off buildings like that

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.840 
just jumping off buildings like that
landing<00:03:20.739> one<00:03:20.920> of<00:03:21.010> those<00:03:21.130> things<00:03:21.310> by<00:03:21.519> landing

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
landing one of those things by landing

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:22.800 
landing one of those things by landing
in<00:03:21.940> that<00:03:22.060> they<00:03:22.150> gave<00:03:22.299> me<00:03:22.360> a<00:03:22.420> little<00:03:22.540> bit<00:03:22.690> of

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
in that they gave me a little bit of

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.930 
in that they gave me a little bit of
cover<00:03:22.989> to<00:03:23.110> get<00:03:23.200> out<00:03:23.350> of<00:03:23.500> there<00:03:23.620> and<00:03:23.799> I<00:03:24.610> can<00:03:24.640> run

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
cover to get out of there and I can run

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.640 
cover to get out of there and I can run
away<00:03:25.030> again<00:03:25.120> an<00:03:25.450> i<00:03:25.540> survived<00:03:25.930> and<00:03:26.260> I<00:03:26.410> take<00:03:26.620> a

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
away again an i survived and I take a

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.800 
away again an i survived and I take a
couple<00:03:27.010> guys<00:03:27.160> here<00:03:27.459> but<00:03:28.299> yeah<00:03:28.420> so<00:03:28.570> when<00:03:28.690> you

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
couple guys here but yeah so when you

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.780 
couple guys here but yeah so when you
use<00:03:28.930> your<00:03:29.380> surroundings<00:03:30.190> basically<00:03:30.610> what

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
use your surroundings basically what

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.789 
use your surroundings basically what
that<00:03:30.820> kind<00:03:31.600> of<00:03:31.750> means<00:03:31.959> is<00:03:32.230> that<00:03:32.260> if<00:03:32.620> you're

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
that kind of means is that if you're

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
of leads into tip number two which would

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.449 
of leads into tip number two which would
be<00:04:13.630> flanking<00:04:14.290> people<00:04:14.709> just<00:04:14.920> flank<00:04:15.220> like<00:04:15.430> a

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
be flanking people just flank like a

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.940 
be flanking people just flank like a
mofo<00:04:16.030> because<00:04:16.419> that<00:04:16.660> is<00:04:16.810> the<00:04:17.019> tactic<00:04:17.470> I<00:04:17.560> rely

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
mofo because that is the tactic I rely

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.449 
mofo because that is the tactic I rely
on<00:04:18.100> a<00:04:18.340> lot<00:04:18.370> in<00:04:18.910> this<00:04:19.060> game<00:04:19.269> is<00:04:20.010> flanking<00:04:21.010> partly

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
on a lot in this game is flanking partly

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:22.820 
on a lot in this game is flanking partly
because<00:04:21.609> my<00:04:21.849> internet<00:04:22.300> connect

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
because my internet connect

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.469 
because my internet connect
isn't<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:23.340> greatest<00:04:23.460> in<00:04:23.879> the<00:04:23.909> world<00:04:24.000> so

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
isn't the greatest in the world so

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.439 
isn't the greatest in the world so
indirect<00:04:24.900> fire<00:04:25.080> fights<00:04:25.470> I<00:04:25.800> might<00:04:26.729> die<00:04:27.120> because

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:27.449 
indirect fire fights I might die because

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:29.749 
indirect fire fights I might die because
my<00:04:27.810> internet<00:04:28.199> connection<00:04:28.319> is<00:04:28.919> just<00:04:29.370> kind<00:04:29.580> of

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:29.759 
my internet connection is just kind of

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:32.300 
my internet connection is just kind of
it<00:04:30.389> decides<00:04:30.720> to<00:04:30.990> stop<00:04:31.469> and<00:04:31.800> be<00:04:32.069> really

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
it decides to stop and be really

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.059 
it decides to stop and be really
retarded<00:04:33.180> and<00:04:33.539> lame<00:04:33.870> sometimes<00:04:34.259> so<00:04:34.710> you<00:04:34.770> know
