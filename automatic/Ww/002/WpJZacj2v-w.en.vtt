you<00:00:23.340> can<00:00:23.460> see<00:00:23.640> how<00:00:23.730> it's<00:00:23.880> mounted<00:00:24.240> towards<00:00:24.570> the

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
you can see how it's mounted towards the

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.349 
you can see how it's mounted towards the
rear<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.140> rig<00:00:25.320> this<00:00:25.800> was<00:00:25.980> intentional<00:00:26.369> the

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
rear of the rig this was intentional the

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.210 
rear of the rig this was intentional the
idea<00:00:27.660> was<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:28.109> that<00:00:28.320> in<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.560> early<00:00:28.619> days<00:00:28.800> with

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
idea was is that in the early days with

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.490 
idea was is that in the early days with
heavy<00:00:30.000> spark<00:00:30.539> ignition<00:00:30.779> engines<00:00:31.260> with<00:00:31.470> the

the<00:00:34.410> weight<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.980> this<00:00:35.640> necessitated<00:00:36.300> need<00:00:36.809> to

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
the weight and this necessitated need to

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.319 
the weight and this necessitated need to
be<00:00:37.290> wound<00:00:37.559> so<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.370> wasn't<00:00:38.670> uncommon<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.180> have<00:00:39.300> a

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
be wound so it wasn't uncommon to have a

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.440 
be wound so it wasn't uncommon to have a
small<00:00:39.600> crank<00:00:39.960> built<00:00:40.860> in<00:00:41.070> three<00:00:41.430> was<00:00:41.760> windup

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
small crank built in three was windup

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.410 
small crank built in three was windup
yes<00:00:43.290> screamin<00:00:43.710> rubber<00:00:43.980> like<00:00:44.160> so<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:45.030> receiver

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
yes screamin rubber like so the receiver

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.920 
yes screamin rubber like so the receiver
is<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.289> teratoma<00:00:47.250> -<00:00:47.730> this<00:00:48.420> was<00:00:48.629> for<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.809> home

I'd like to show you this working now
again<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:46.860> have<00:01:47.270> typically<00:01:48.270> one<00:01:48.479> plus<00:01:48.659> four

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840

this<00:01:54.060> case<00:01:54.329> kick<00:01:54.750> down<00:01:54.960> was<00:01:55.170> also<00:01:55.500> quite

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
this case kick down was also quite

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.990 
this case kick down was also quite
common<00:01:56.040> in<00:01:56.280> gliders<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:57.450> quick<00:01:57.600> blip<00:01:59.000> and

escapements<00:02:05.939> every<00:02:06.869> time<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.350> activate<00:02:07.740> the

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
escapements every time you activate the

escapements every time you activate the
shuttle<00:02:08.399> you've<00:02:09.300> got<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.479> cyclic<00:02:09.959> kick<00:02:10.229> which

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
shuttle you've got a cyclic kick which

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.080 
shuttle you've got a cyclic kick which
meant<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:11.009> rubberband<00:02:11.430> ran<00:02:11.670> down<00:02:11.849> a<00:02:11.879> little

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
meant the rubberband ran down a little

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.050 
meant the rubberband ran down a little
bit<00:02:12.270> more

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
bit more

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.370 
bit more
you<00:02:13.180> have<00:02:13.330> to<00:02:13.450> be<00:02:13.540> mindful<00:02:13.840> of<00:02:13.989> this<00:02:14.140> when

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
you have to be mindful of this when

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.350 
you have to be mindful of this when
flying<00:02:14.880> so<00:02:15.880> there<00:02:16.090> we<00:02:16.209> go

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
flying so there we go

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.920 
flying so there we go
there's<00:02:16.690> two<00:02:16.870> examples<00:02:17.410> of<00:02:17.849> the<00:02:18.849> backend<00:02:19.810> of

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
there's two examples of the backend of

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.530 
there's two examples of the backend of
development<00:02:20.410> with<00:02:20.530> single-channel<00:02:20.950> and

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
development with single-channel and

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.949 
development with single-channel and
there<00:02:22.540> we<00:02:22.660> go

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
there we go

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.839 
there we go
as<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.260> early<00:02:23.470> days<00:02:23.800> I<00:02:23.920> mean<00:02:24.069> clearly<00:02:24.730> there

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
as the early days I mean clearly there

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.190 
as the early days I mean clearly there
were<00:02:24.910> valve<00:02:25.150> receivers<00:02:25.780> that<00:02:25.989> were<00:02:26.050> much

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
were valve receivers that were much

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.960 
were valve receivers that were much
earlier<00:02:26.530> than<00:02:26.560> this<00:02:26.770> but<00:02:26.980> compared<00:02:27.640> in<00:02:27.760> early

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
earlier than this but compared in early

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.210 
earlier than this but compared in early
transistor<00:02:28.540> technology<00:02:29.069> little<00:02:30.069> later

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
transistor technology little later

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.290 
transistor technology little later
