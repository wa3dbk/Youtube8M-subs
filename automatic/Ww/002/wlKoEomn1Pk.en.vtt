00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.860
 there are many beautiful women but they are 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:11.590
 very few that have one thing 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.520
 unforgettable 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:17.320
 and that comes from the heart comes from the face of 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.920
 body of all comes is a combination 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.270
 of the two things when I was 17 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.750
 I made a new comedy fashion show 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:28.110
 york was already starting too and I 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.620
 I fell in love with her 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:35.850
 because it was because it was unique because it had 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:38.730
 a spectacular body but I had was 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.600
 white and had a wonderful skin and 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.270
 had something different to all at all 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.520
 other women but the body was 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.170
 especially incredible us 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.220
 we only want to work with women 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.230
 well in fashion because if you see the 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.510
 number of women who are working 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.610
 still coming from that time type 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.310
 we can achieve here there are more charged in 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.770
 all the women who are up to this end 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.560
 and all those women who are women 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.509
 women have a bigger future than 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.750
 all of them unless it's a model 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:15.750
 as if so artfully that it's unique in 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.130
 your blog but the women who are beautiful 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.700
 but beautiful and naturally always 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.170
 They are are more loved than the others 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.149
 we work with Africans with 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.000
 American with English with French 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:32.070
 with everything with models from denmark 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.650
 like from Canadians 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:39.210
 it is not done, it is not because it is 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.390
 Brazilian that is design is because it is 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:46.940
 Giselle, how beautiful 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.940
 for me in the most important models 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.980
 of our time 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.299
 it can be said that one of them is maybe 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.090
 he and the other is that more than they are the 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.040
 opposed completely but they are two 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.110
 sifters also if it comes out much more 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.970
 natural is much more bony here too 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.850
 natural too but an English way 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.560
 it's not a Latin way then it's a 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.880
 very different thing that you are much more 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:18.350
 rock know and irreverent and says he is more 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.350
 natural and much more 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.840
 more Latin in his being not to be 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:28.569
 Anglo but they have the same type 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.319
 of knowledge passion 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.719
 intelligence of knowledge 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.060
 the work what they need from them is 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:37.660
 a super democratic person and behind 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.970
 everyone the same 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.970
 that's a good thing it's a lesson from 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.610
 class first of all we should all 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.830
 be like that because why are you here or are you 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.620
 there should not change the treatment of 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.660
 a person for nothing that I that I 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.970
 breed like that then that's the thing that I 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.400
 I understand that fashion is not an aspect 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:01.230
 of fashion that you see very often but 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.230
 well that's a problem either
