00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:06.320
 hello how are good right now I 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.380
 they have made an inquiry about alcohol 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.360
 and good training let's go 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.629
 directly to the grain the alcohol is not 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.520
 good in none of the points about 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:19.490
 exercise is never good alcohol 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.910
 you have to try to avoid it the myth of 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.890
 glass of wine the glass of whatever the 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.810
 any alcoholic beverage is not good 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.910
 under no circumstances at a point of 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.859
 You do not have to drink alcohol if you 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.560
 does exercise they were placed doing goes to 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:36.410
 be oxidize the particles and what is the 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:39.100
 protein synthesis true yet and 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:42.650
 the supplements either creatine 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:45.200
 carnitine the protein whatever it is 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.630
 derivatives or extinguished supplements what 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.730
 they do is impede our progress if 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.860
 we go in a golden pyramid of 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.690
 growth and a plan that we're 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.940
 doing what they do which is 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.100
 delay or 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.379
 we're not going to delay it with anger it's not 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.710
 that makes us consume in bodybuilding we 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:06.049
 prevents protein synthesis and progressive 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.119
 is going to make us instead of arriving as 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.870
 we would have to get there we go much more 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.320
 slow 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.570
 Well that is very convenient not to take 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.400
 alcohol under any point of view is 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.830
 ideal to go directly leaving it 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.140
 gradually for people who are 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.190
 drinkers or like people 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.720
 who are occasional drinkers 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.900
 directly remove the service 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.000
 and logically like the cigarette 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.110
 if the person smokes the person who does 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.690
 it's almost smoke it has a 30 between a 30 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.800
 and 40 percent less force than 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.810
 a person who does not smoke is already 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.870
 exactly the same training and 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.340
 take we saw supplements and more the 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.890
 tobacco 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.740
 to put it in a very lyrical or 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.649
 be a pay, dedicate what is the 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.969
 effect of creatine and protein two 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.460
 of the most important things that one 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.780
 you need just to train 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.540
 Creatine stays naturally 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.670
 eating meat fish all this kind of 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.750
 meat as it is acquired in a 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:14.320
 synthetic or by means of supplements 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.940
 so tobacco and alcohol 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.950
 if you exercise so much to lower 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:22.800
 of weight as to raise of musculature 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.769
 not under any other no is not 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.540
 admissible is not so visible there are people 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.450
 that says good of a single cigarette 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.480
 flight today is only something at night 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.739
 and I'll take one or two glasses of alcohol in 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.860
 this try to avoid that directly 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:40.380
 very generally I tell you I do not 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.780
 I would not do it and I will not do it 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.760
 because I sincerely prefer to take care of myself 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.010
 truth and it 's okay and I look good 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.730
 inside everything that is not really 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.870
 without taking bad things or taking things that 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.300
 good that logically has hurt me 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.820
 my organism 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.140
 just like you consult one you know no 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.400
 can be the query in the box 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.080
 comments to work and yours has been 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.030
 open to say your opinions your 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.980
 views and others this 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.200
 logically is my point of view is my 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.150
 say what you Americans 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.730
 they can have their own opinion and that's why 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.630
 you are welcome to expand here below 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.630
 Thank you
