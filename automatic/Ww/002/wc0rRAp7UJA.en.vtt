00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 many Americans are fond of dolls 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:09.330
 collects them and some even 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.120
 paint here for example one of 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:17.690
 ring here this doll is painted 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:20.539
 manually and therefore it costs 65 dollars 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:26.340
 nicely dressed 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:27.750
 nice to the end well my children and smash 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.289
 so buy my anything all 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.930
 our beauties these dolls are cheaper they 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:38.309
 $ 15 here in the boxes are new 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.800
 not even open leg horns they can 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.129
 buy even 10 for 5 dollars sometimes 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.399
 they are collectible but have released a lot of them 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:51.449
 so they are not very rare that 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:54.590
 beautiful dolls and they play fair 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:59.280
 speaking mostly not children but women 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:01.199
 put them on the shelf admiring them 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.850
 sometimes dress up but in principle more 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.670
 part they collecting you don't even 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.189
 open out of the box so as not to gather dust 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.869
 look at them so much 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:12.060
 dolls that look like real 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.760
 kids are popular here too because 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:20.909
 many people are single especially women 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:23.280
 if they work outside of home they often 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:28.229
 remain lonely and the doll such 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:31.740
 helps them to be changed and such science and 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:36.689
 jars such as another doll 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.810
 collectible this is the local culture on and 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:43.320
 reef america world you ocean this 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.930
 natural american indians and here 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.920
 for example we have an Indian 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.829
 probably this indian is called this 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:57.000
 a doll costs 100 dollars 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:59.219
 again it is hand painted beautiful 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.140
 but no one will play with her 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.890
 she will stand 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:07.049
 I will admire also popular 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.970
 dolls with celebrity faces for example 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:15.290

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:20.900
 wedding dress here is a doll worth 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:24.160
 forty dollars just enough 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:28.760
 toothy pupa 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.860
 the same collectible wearing 60s clothes 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:37.040
 years 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:39.739
 more successful than the fashion of the 60s 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.310
 collectible doll such did in the 70s 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:46.370
 years she has big beautiful eyes 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.140
 beautiful dress again they just 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:52.130
 they are not worth playing 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.080
 in order to look at them well 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:58.489
 honestly these dolls are not for me 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:01.610
 I like this doll in her eyes 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:04.190
 close open then you look 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:14.570
 on her dress 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:18.040
 about as much in the lush sport such a doll here 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.040
 only 7 dollars worth 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.930
 christmas doll 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:28.250

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.720
 it's a little more expensive here 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.319
 still there 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.840

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:35.300
 antique dolls in good condition 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:37.389
 it's hard to find here because the state is not 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:41.450
 old just one hundred years old therefore 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:43.930
 most houses have songs no more than a hundred 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:46.760
 years they and most of the houses 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:49.190
 he is only thirty years old 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.169
 less so several times already people 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.740
 moved all cleaned threw out 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.200
 handed over 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.810
 and so here it is to go to the attic 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:02.030
 and find something a hundred years old not 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:04.030
 it is possible here are beautiful old dolls they 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.350
 price 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:11.680
 big here these here they are almost 900 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:15.680
 dollars worth these two dolls are worth 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.870
 175 dollars a thing here dolls too 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.540
 interesting well as i just said them 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:23.389
 so not to find let's say go to some 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:26.320
 in the attic or somebody moves adab 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:30.010
 find such they tommy 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:32.740
 moving here often and at home all old 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:36.950
 these ladies 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:40.550
 now these are actually vases they can 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:43.220
 stuff the flowers on top when and not 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.789
 sold in the 60s then they were just 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.560
 vase 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:47.720
 and then they turned out to be enough 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.410
 collectible and now here is such 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.590
 bath 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:54.350
 worth 85 dollars and there are some too 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.820
 vases are not called even the whole course 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:59.370
 the head weighs a vase 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:01.250
 and some of them 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.479
 for $ 300 and going wild 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:06.110
 they were sold just a vase roller with 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:06.110
 flowers 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:20.060
 Here is such an abandoned nymph inflicted 

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:22.639
 put 10 dollars fruit and for these 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:29.830
 money will not buy these on 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:29.830
 with a bang 3 this should 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:41.740
 since these collectible dolls eat food 

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:43.060
 more expensive they are almost new and it is firm 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:46.590
 modern Alexander
