00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
your eyes tight like this that's called

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.550 
your eyes tight like this that's called
the<00:01:45.700> that's<00:01:46.000> called<00:01:46.240> the<00:01:46.299> safety<00:01:46.539> squint<00:01:47.020> it

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
the that's called the safety squint it

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.810 
the that's called the safety squint it
just<00:01:47.740> realized<00:01:48.009> that<00:01:48.159> these<00:01:48.280> little<00:01:48.490> plastic

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
just realized that these little plastic

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.029 
just realized that these little plastic
bushings<00:01:49.330> need<00:01:49.539> to<00:01:49.630> go<00:01:49.720> in<00:01:49.869> the<00:01:49.960> hole<00:01:50.200> not<00:01:50.770> just

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039 
bushings need to go in the hole not just

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:53.760 
bushings need to go in the hole not just
the<00:01:51.130> bolt<00:01:51.369> so<00:01:51.840> looks<00:01:52.840> like<00:01:52.960> you<00:01:53.380> need<00:01:53.530> to<00:01:53.649> use<00:01:53.740> a

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
the bolt so looks like you need to use a

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.090 
the bolt so looks like you need to use a
quarter<00:01:54.159> inch<00:01:54.399> drill<00:01:55.240> bit<00:01:55.619> for<00:01:56.619> these<00:01:56.800> to<00:01:56.950> go

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
quarter inch drill bit for these to go

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.609 
quarter inch drill bit for these to go
in<00:01:57.220> there<00:01:57.429> and<00:01:57.610> then<00:01:58.360> it<00:01:58.479> kind<00:01:58.659> of<00:01:58.720> helps<00:01:58.990> it<00:01:59.080> be

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
in there and then it kind of helps it be

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.840 
in there and then it kind of helps it be
a<00:01:59.649> smoother<00:02:00.220> hinge<00:02:00.580> when<00:02:00.789> it<00:02:00.909> opens<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:03.369> just

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
a smoother hinge when it opens so just

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.199 
a smoother hinge when it opens so just
let<00:02:04.030> me<00:02:04.060> ream<00:02:04.569> these<00:02:04.810> babies<00:02:05.259> out<00:02:06.209> that's
