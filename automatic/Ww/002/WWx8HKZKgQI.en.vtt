00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
the people that like my shampoos and

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.649 
the people that like my shampoos and
conditioners<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.640> smell<00:01:20.850> quite<00:01:20.970> fruity<00:01:21.450> and

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
conditioners to smell quite fruity and

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.570 
conditioners to smell quite fruity and
sweet<00:01:22.280> and<00:01:23.280> these<00:01:23.490> smell<00:01:24.060> quite<00:01:24.299> chemically

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110

think they could smell ten times better

clean<00:01:55.110> especially<00:01:55.470> this<00:01:55.829> shampoo<00:01:56.540> it's

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
clean especially this shampoo it's

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.420 
clean especially this shampoo it's
definitely<00:01:57.899> one<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.049> those<00:01:58.200> shampoos<00:01:58.950> where

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
definitely one of those shampoos where

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.789 
definitely one of those shampoos where
you<00:01:59.640> use<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.689> has<00:02:00.810> like<00:02:00.990> super<00:02:01.530> silky

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
you use it and it has like super silky

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.679 
you use it and it has like super silky
not<00:02:02.790> silky<00:02:03.180> super<00:02:03.600> like<00:02:04.110> squeaky<00:02:04.740> clean<00:02:05.360> so<00:02:06.360> it

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
not silky super like squeaky clean so it

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.690 
not silky super like squeaky clean so it
definitely<00:02:06.869> doesn't<00:02:07.320> work<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:08.369> clean<00:02:08.580> your

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
definitely doesn't work to clean your

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.260 
definitely doesn't work to clean your
hair<00:02:08.879> thoroughly<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.599> wouldn't<00:02:10.349> say<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.560> it's

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
hair thoroughly I wouldn't say that it's

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.430 
hair thoroughly I wouldn't say that it's
volumizing<00:02:12.270> at<00:02:12.480> all<00:02:12.750> I<00:02:13.020> mean

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
volumizing at all I mean

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.390 
volumizing at all I mean
comparing<00:02:13.830> it<00:02:13.950> to<00:02:14.160> like<00:02:15.030> my<00:02:15.300> tikki<00:02:16.400> volumizing

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
comparing it to like my tikki volumizing

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.100 
comparing it to like my tikki volumizing
shampoo<00:02:17.850> and<00:02:17.970> conditioner<00:02:18.420> where<00:02:18.660> when<00:02:19.080> I

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
shampoo and conditioner where when I

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.630 
shampoo and conditioner where when I
blow<00:02:19.380> dried<00:02:19.650> it<00:02:19.680> I<00:02:19.860> could<00:02:20.010> actually<00:02:20.160> feel<00:02:20.610> the

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
blow dried it I could actually feel the

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.960 
blow dried it I could actually feel the
volume<00:02:21.150> in<00:02:21.240> it<00:02:21.620> this<00:02:22.620> doesn't<00:02:23.130> really<00:02:23.220> do<00:02:23.640> much

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
volume in it this doesn't really do much

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.340 
volume in it this doesn't really do much
I<00:02:24.330> mean<00:02:24.480> it<00:02:24.630> doesn't<00:02:24.930> weigh<00:02:24.990> my<00:02:25.140> hair<00:02:25.170> down

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
I mean it doesn't weigh my hair down

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.820 
I mean it doesn't weigh my hair down
which<00:02:26.250> is<00:02:26.460> nice<00:02:26.670> but<00:02:27.240> it<00:02:27.750> also<00:02:27.960> doesn't<00:02:28.590> really

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
which is nice but it also doesn't really

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.740 
which is nice but it also doesn't really
it<00:02:29.490> doesn't<00:02:29.670> really<00:02:29.760> have<00:02:29.940> an<00:02:30.030> effect<00:02:30.270> on<00:02:30.570> it

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
it doesn't really have an effect on it

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.960 
it doesn't really have an effect on it
it's<00:02:31.020> just<00:02:31.290> a<00:02:31.500> normal<00:02:32.190> shampoo<00:02:32.820> and

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
it's just a normal shampoo and

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.630 
it's just a normal shampoo and
conditioner<00:02:33.480> for<00:02:33.960> normal<00:02:34.860> hair<00:02:35.010> I<00:02:35.280> would<00:02:35.340> say

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
conditioner for normal hair I would say

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.990 
conditioner for normal hair I would say
I<00:02:35.960> don't<00:02:36.960> really<00:02:37.230> notice<00:02:37.590> any<00:02:37.800> difference<00:02:38.310> for

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
I don't really notice any difference for

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.190 
I don't really notice any difference for
my<00:02:39.180> fine<00:02:39.480> hair<00:02:39.810> it<00:02:40.080> still<00:02:40.380> has<00:02:40.680> flyaways<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:41.850> I

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
my fine hair it still has flyaways and I

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.420 
my fine hair it still has flyaways and I
mean<00:02:43.200> it<00:02:43.290> doesn't<00:02:43.470> make<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:43.770> any<00:02:43.860> easier<00:02:43.980> to

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
mean it doesn't make it any easier to

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.780 
mean it doesn't make it any easier to
style<00:02:44.760> or<00:02:45.000> anything<00:02:45.180> it's<00:02:45.540> literally<00:02:46.020> just<00:02:46.050> a

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
style or anything it's literally just a

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.330 
style or anything it's literally just a
shampoo<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:47.820> conditioner<00:02:48.510> so<00:02:48.750> I<00:02:48.780> don't<00:02:49.340> know

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
shampoo and conditioner so I don't know

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.250 
shampoo and conditioner so I don't know
I<00:02:50.910> mean<00:02:51.450> I've<00:02:51.570> tried<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:53.180> damaged<00:02:54.260> hair

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
I mean I've tried the damaged hair

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.830 
I mean I've tried the damaged hair
conditioner<00:02:55.890> I've<00:02:56.400> got<00:02:57.120> that<00:02:57.300> in<00:02:57.330> my<00:02:57.510> sure<00:02:57.690> at

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
conditioner I've got that in my sure at

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.930 
conditioner I've got that in my sure at
the<00:02:57.930> moment<00:02:58.200> as<00:02:58.260> well<00:02:58.320> and<00:02:58.770> that<00:02:59.070> I<00:02:59.370> quite<00:02:59.700> like

the moment as well and that I quite like

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.340 
the moment as well and that I quite like
but<00:03:00.300> I<00:03:00.330> wouldn't<00:03:00.600> say<00:03:00.780> that<00:03:00.810> was<00:03:01.110> really

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
but I wouldn't say that was really

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.220 
but I wouldn't say that was really
moisturizing<00:03:01.920> either<00:03:02.240> so<00:03:03.240> overall<00:03:03.960> I'm

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
moisturizing either so overall I'm

fantastic<00:03:55.200> products<00:03:55.470> either<00:03:55.680> there<00:03:56.340> are

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
fantastic products either there are

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.830 
fantastic products either there are
better<00:03:56.580> shampoos<00:03:57.060> and<00:03:57.300> conditioners<00:03:57.720> out

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
better shampoos and conditioners out

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.270 
better shampoos and conditioners out
there<00:03:58.050> and<00:03:58.230> for<00:03:58.380> a<00:03:58.440> cheaper<00:03:58.709> price<00:03:58.739> as<00:03:59.100> well<00:03:59.250> I

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
there and for a cheaper price as well I

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.210 
there and for a cheaper price as well I
think<00:03:59.700> these<00:04:00.630> are<00:04:00.690> something<00:04:01.230> like<00:04:01.260> 5<00:04:01.739> to<00:04:01.980> 6

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
think these are something like 5 to 6

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.940 
think these are something like 5 to 6
pound<00:04:02.519> each<00:04:03.260> which<00:04:04.260> is<00:04:04.380> why<00:04:04.500> I<00:04:04.530> got<00:04:04.739> them<00:04:04.800> for

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
pound each which is why I got them for

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.979 
pound each which is why I got them for
the<00:04:05.040> three<00:04:05.130> for<00:04:05.370> two<00:04:05.489> so<00:04:06.239> they're<00:04:06.390> not<00:04:06.540> cheap

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
the three for two so they're not cheap

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.960 
the three for two so they're not cheap
and<00:04:07.350> I<00:04:07.860> think<00:04:08.040> for<00:04:08.160> the<00:04:08.250> price<00:04:08.489> of<00:04:08.519> them<00:04:08.790> they

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
and I think for the price of them they

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.910 
and I think for the price of them they
could<00:04:09.150> just<00:04:09.390> be<00:04:09.660> so<00:04:10.080> much<00:04:10.440> better<00:04:10.620> than<00:04:10.800> they

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
could just be so much better than they

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.800 
could just be so much better than they
