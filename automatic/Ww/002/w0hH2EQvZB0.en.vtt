00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
with it now the only con I can think of

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.410 
with it now the only con I can think of
is<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.650> LTE<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:26.490> not<00:01:26.700> supported<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.390> can

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
is that LTE is not supported you can

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.840 
is that LTE is not supported you can
only<00:01:27.720> get<00:01:27.990> 3G<00:01:28.530> speeds<00:01:28.920> but<00:01:29.280> when<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.520> comes<00:01:29.700> to

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
only get 3G speeds but when it comes to

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.370 
only get 3G speeds but when it comes to
the<00:01:29.939> actual<00:01:30.299> time<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.600> takes<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.020> unlock<00:01:31.259> your

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
the actual time it takes to unlock your

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
firmware on any carrier now if you did

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.710 
firmware on any carrier now if you did
order<00:03:01.190> one<00:03:01.430> for<00:03:01.610> a<00:03:01.640> 4s<00:03:02.060> you'll<00:03:02.240> get<00:03:02.390> a<00:03:02.420> slightly

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
order one for a 4s you'll get a slightly

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.270 
order one for a 4s you'll get a slightly
bigger<00:03:03.050> one<00:03:03.290> which<00:03:03.470> you<00:03:03.620> will<00:03:03.770> have<00:03:03.920> to<00:03:04.010> cut<00:03:04.190> to

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
bigger one which you will have to cut to

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.650 
bigger one which you will have to cut to
the<00:03:04.370> size<00:03:04.580> of<00:03:04.700> your<00:03:04.760> SIM<00:03:05.060> card<00:03:05.090> but<00:03:05.540> it's

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
the size of your SIM card but it's

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.270 
the size of your SIM card but it's
really<00:03:05.930> easy<00:03:06.110> anyways<00:03:06.830> it<00:03:07.010> has<00:03:07.040> a<00:03:07.130> little

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
really easy anyways it has a little

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.490 
really easy anyways it has a little
sticky<00:03:07.730> on<00:03:07.760> the<00:03:07.970> back<00:03:08.150> so<00:03:08.420> go<00:03:08.570> ahead<00:03:08.840> and<00:03:09.020> just

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
sticky on the back so go ahead and just

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.350 
sticky on the back so go ahead and just
stick<00:03:09.770> it<00:03:09.890> back<00:03:10.010> onto<00:03:10.310> the<00:03:10.550> back<00:03:10.700> of<00:03:10.940> your<00:03:11.060> nano

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.570 
stick it back onto the back of your nano
SIM<00:03:11.720> and<00:03:11.930> that's<00:03:12.440> it<00:03:12.680> you're<00:03:13.010> done<00:03:13.040> on<00:03:13.490> the

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
SIM and that's it you're done on the

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.730 
SIM and that's it you're done on the
hardware<00:03:13.970> side<00:03:14.210> so<00:03:14.540> it<00:03:14.600> acts<00:03:14.840> just<00:03:15.080> like<00:03:15.440> a

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
hardware side so it acts just like a

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.590 
hardware side so it acts just like a
regular<00:03:16.100> SIM<00:03:16.610> card<00:03:16.850> you<00:03:16.910> just<00:03:17.090> put<00:03:17.270> it<00:03:17.360> inside

regular SIM card you just put it inside

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.990 
regular SIM card you just put it inside
your<00:03:17.840> original<00:03:18.440> tray<00:03:18.740> and<00:03:18.980> you're<00:03:19.490> done<00:03:19.760> there

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
your original tray and you're done there

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.460 
your original tray and you're done there
