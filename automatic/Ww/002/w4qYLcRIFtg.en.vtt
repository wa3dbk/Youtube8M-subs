00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
vomiting globs of electrified goo at you

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.850 
vomiting globs of electrified goo at you
and<00:02:28.880> then<00:02:29.300> throwing<00:02:29.570> anything<00:02:29.870> at<00:02:30.200> his<00:02:30.290> mouth

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
and then throwing anything at his mouth

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.920 
and then throwing anything at his mouth
wow<00:02:31.610> this<00:02:31.790> one's<00:02:32.000> fairly<00:02:32.210> easy<00:02:32.540> to<00:02:32.690> be

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
wow this one's fairly easy to be

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.500 
wow this one's fairly easy to be
probably<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.620> easiest<00:02:33.980> of<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.220> three

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
probably the easiest of the three

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.340 
probably the easiest of the three
because<00:02:35.510> all<00:02:35.630> you<00:02:35.690> have<00:02:35.780> to<00:02:35.870> do<00:02:35.960> is<00:02:36.110> make<00:02:36.320> sure

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
because all you have to do is make sure

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.930 
because all you have to do is make sure
you<00:02:36.590> don't<00:02:36.800> get<00:02:36.920> hit<00:02:37.160> by<00:02:37.280> those<00:02:37.460> things<00:02:37.670> when

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
you don't get hit by those things when

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.490 
you don't get hit by those things when
they<00:02:38.030> hit<00:02:38.180> that<00:02:38.330> one<00:02:38.600> spot<00:02:39.020> on<00:02:39.050> the<00:02:39.290> ground

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
they hit that one spot on the ground

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.220 
they hit that one spot on the ground
they<00:02:39.740> go<00:02:39.890> too<00:02:40.030> so<00:02:41.030> not<00:02:41.360> a<00:02:41.420> lot<00:02:41.600> of<00:02:41.630> challenge

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
they go too so not a lot of challenge

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.160 
they go too so not a lot of challenge
with<00:02:42.410> this<00:02:42.650> one<00:02:42.950> but<00:02:43.160> you<00:02:43.610> know<00:02:43.730> still

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
with this one but you know still

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.040 
with this one but you know still
interesting<00:02:45.170> at<00:02:45.500> play<00:02:45.740> this<00:02:46.040> is<00:02:46.190> just<00:02:46.520> a

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
interesting at play this is just a

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.240 
interesting at play this is just a
weird-looking<00:02:48.050> boss<00:02:48.260> and<00:02:48.620> weird<00:02:48.980> looking

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
weird-looking boss and weird looking

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.510 
weird-looking boss and weird looking
thing<00:02:49.280> days<00:02:50.260> I<00:02:51.260> miss<00:02:51.740> an<00:02:51.830> opportunity<00:02:52.340> to<00:02:52.400> get

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
thing days I miss an opportunity to get

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.050 
thing days I miss an opportunity to get
to<00:02:52.670> that<00:02:52.910> one<00:02:53.150> but<00:02:54.050> I<00:02:54.400> still<00:02:55.400> knock<00:02:55.760> him<00:02:55.940> out

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
to that one but I still knock him out

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.020 
to that one but I still knock him out
with<00:02:56.120> out<00:02:56.810> getting<00:02:57.020> killed<00:02:57.440> that<00:02:57.650> time<00:02:57.890> no<00:02:58.820> big

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
with out getting killed that time no big

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.160 
with out getting killed that time no big
loss<00:02:59.180> no<00:02:59.480> big<00:02:59.660> deal

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
loss no big deal

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.340 
loss no big deal
and<00:03:01.010> then<00:03:01.220> this<00:03:01.430> third<00:03:01.670> one<00:03:01.880> fell<00:03:02.209> is<00:03:02.420> the<00:03:02.660> most

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
and then this third one fell is the most

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.980 
and then this third one fell is the most
challenging<00:03:03.650> of<00:03:04.190> the<00:03:04.490> three<00:03:05.180> stages<00:03:05.510> of<00:03:05.810> this

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
challenging of the three stages of this

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.990 
challenging of the three stages of this
boss<00:03:08.050> we'll<00:03:09.050> see<00:03:09.260> in<00:03:09.500> a<00:03:09.590> moment<00:03:09.770> that<00:03:10.010> he

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
boss we'll see in a moment that he

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.440 
boss we'll see in a moment that he
charges<00:03:11.959> up<00:03:12.580> first<00:03:13.580> approach<00:03:13.850> to<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.120> wall<00:03:14.300> if

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
charges up first approach to the wall if

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.199 
charges up first approach to the wall if
you<00:03:14.570> always<00:03:14.690> can<00:03:15.170> ask<00:03:15.920> like<00:03:16.280> that<00:03:16.459> but<00:03:16.700> he

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
you always can ask like that but he

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.620 
you always can ask like that but he
charges<00:03:17.750> up<00:03:17.930> a<00:03:18.110> laser<00:03:18.890> and<00:03:19.459> so<00:03:20.390> you<00:03:20.450> have<00:03:20.600> a

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
charges up a laser and so you have a

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.560 
charges up a laser and so you have a
couple<00:03:21.320> of<00:03:21.470> seconds<00:03:21.890> to<00:03:22.030> get<00:03:23.030> through<00:03:23.390> the

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
couple of seconds to get through the

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.050 
couple of seconds to get through the
laser<00:03:23.750> up<00:03:23.989> onto<00:03:24.230> that<00:03:24.290> platform<00:03:24.590> and<00:03:25.580> wait

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
laser up onto that platform and wait

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.540 
laser up onto that platform and wait
from<00:03:26.269> the<00:03:26.510> chart<00:03:27.110> just<00:03:27.440> discharge<00:03:28.220> it<00:03:28.400> and

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
from the chart just discharge it and

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.600 
from the chart just discharge it and
then<00:03:28.700> say<00:03:29.570> anything<00:03:29.900> every<00:03:30.170> bubble<00:03:30.610> rinse

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
then say anything every bubble rinse

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:32.020 
then say anything every bubble rinse
repeat

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
repeat

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.430 
repeat
so<00:03:32.900> like<00:03:33.620> I<00:03:33.769> said<00:03:34.090> once<00:03:35.090> you<00:03:35.239> figured<00:03:35.690> out<00:03:35.840> how

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
so like I said once you figured out how

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.070 
so like I said once you figured out how
to<00:03:36.470> do<00:03:36.769> it<00:03:36.890> it's<00:03:37.280> not<00:03:37.459> too<00:03:37.760> hard<00:03:38.060> things<00:03:38.840> like

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
to do it it's not too hard things like

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.210 
to do it it's not too hard things like
that<00:03:39.290> will<00:03:39.500> happen<00:03:39.709> so<00:03:40.250> just<00:03:40.519> be<00:03:40.700> careful<00:03:42.220> that

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
that will happen so just be careful that

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.940 
that will happen so just be careful that
bounce<00:03:43.459> pad<00:03:43.760> is<00:03:43.970> probably<00:03:44.590> not<00:03:45.590> in<00:03:45.650> the<00:03:45.920> best

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
bounce pad is probably not in the best

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:54.759 
bounce pad is probably not in the best
place<00:03:46.959> for<00:03:49.390> momentum<00:03:50.390> purposes<00:03:50.959> of<00:03:51.230> you<00:03:53.500> go<00:03:54.500> at

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
place for momentum purposes of you go at

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.780 
place for momentum purposes of you go at
it<00:03:55.060> towards<00:03:56.060> the<00:03:56.209> left<00:03:56.239> and<00:03:57.370> that's<00:03:58.370> it<00:03:58.670> that's

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
it towards the left and that's it that's

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.490 
it towards the left and that's it that's
the<00:03:58.940> whole<00:03:59.030> boss<00:03:59.390> right<00:03:59.690> there

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
the whole boss right there

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.640 
the whole boss right there
second<00:04:01.340> boss<00:04:01.519> in<00:04:01.700> the<00:04:01.790> game<00:04:02.200> it's<00:04:03.200> fun<00:04:03.310> it's

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
second boss in the game it's fun it's

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.339 
second boss in the game it's fun it's
using<00:04:05.069> that<00:04:05.220> it's<00:04:05.400> fun<00:04:05.670> I<00:04:06.239> would<00:04:06.690> imagine<00:04:06.810> with

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
using that it's fun I would imagine with

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.420 
using that it's fun I would imagine with
more<00:04:08.310> than<00:04:08.549> one<00:04:09.150> players

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
more than one players

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.770 
more than one players
chaos<00:04:11.430> will<00:04:11.819> die<00:04:11.940> many<00:04:12.209> times<00:04:12.269> because<00:04:12.750> people

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
chaos will die many times because people

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.630 
chaos will die many times because people
won't<00:04:13.200> know<00:04:13.349> what<00:04:13.500> they're<00:04:13.620> doing<00:04:13.920> and<00:04:13.950> things

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
like that but either way it's a good
