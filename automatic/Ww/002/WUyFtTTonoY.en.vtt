00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.699
 as friends here once again mike 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:21.529
 of official gadget and we start with the 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:23.960
 good video this time I will 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:27.169
 I bring a very very very essential tweet 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.419
 to create shortcuts in the lock 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:32.630
 screen what does this mean that 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:34.970
 say me apart is a different way 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.820
 to unlock and create shortcuts 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:41.330
 for me to say if it occupied a lot of twitter 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.970
 here he simply slid this wheel 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:47.360
 towards what is twitter and now it opens 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:50.450
 this the twitter application 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.370
 likewise with the other applications by 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.710
 say with cydia 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.350
 here is opening me cydia and is 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.950
 obviously loading here as you can see 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:04.100
 is already charging here wifi to me and so 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:07.310
 these applications that you are going to 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.479
 put are 100% modifiable this wants 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.540
 say that you are going to be able to choose 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:14.060
 the applications which they want 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.620
 put there as direct access and 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.870
 simply to unlock the phone 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:21.619
 normal apply to enter another 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:23.990
 this we give you here and so 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:27.430
 unlocks the phone this little wheel 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.550
 come here this can be modified too 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.350
 and this and we're going to see how we 're going to 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.940
 install first that nobody will have 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.740
 to get in there and wait for that 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.570
 finish loading once you have 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.530
 finished loading if we are going to search and 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:45.800
 that was styled and this means that goes 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.479
 to unlock the device as htc in 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.000
 our case I blog I 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.590
 download from iphone repo m in the 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.790
 description I leave the repo in case not 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.620
 they have it added 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.620
 but if they follow me they already have to have 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.960
 added this repo and this has in the 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.090
 official network in case they want to cooperate with 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.049
 the 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.220
 the developer is in the mont network 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.280
 my life 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:14.560
 this with a price 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.470
 of 99 cents something very accessible and very 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.090
 good this tweet that is pretty good 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.910
 Well now I'm going to teach you how to 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.830
 modify everything on the wheel and how 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.840
 activate this tweet once you have 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.739
 downloaded the tweet will appear in 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:33.010
 your springboard this saying htc the hour 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:36.069
 they are going to open it 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.409
 and they're going to give you here where it says activate and 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:42.270
 then in Ladakh they will also activate the 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:44.550
 dac and here where ring style 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.170
 you choose the symbol that you 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.210
 want me I have the 'captain america' 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.170
 but let's put this so that they see 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:55.200
 that the bubble is modifiable here 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.660
 I'm going to put in blue and here as 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.950
 I told you the applications here wrong 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.450
 we're just going to see this one 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:05.060
 installous the others for worse because 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.960
 and you move them to your liking 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.680
 simply to show them that if 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:13.860
 serves and this is where it says live vibrate 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.480
 iphone unlocking if they have them 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.340
 I recommend that they activate it if not 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.380
 they have no case they give in saving and 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.500
 asks them what's going to be a respite gives 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.850
 in ok and it's going to be a good re spring a 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.150
 once you have finished loading as 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:30.030
 you can see here it already appeared what it is 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.730
 this is no longer the 'captain america' 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.440
 something here more elegant and the bubbles already 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.210
 changed to blue as you can see 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.110
 in which the icons are enclosed 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:43.260
 already here it will change to blue also 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.910
 they just open it here and as you see 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.400
 change installed is that it was the first 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.330
 application that I changed and then I hope that 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.580
 you liked the video 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.920
