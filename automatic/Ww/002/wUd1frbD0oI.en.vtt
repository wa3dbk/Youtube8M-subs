because<00:00:19.189> they<00:00:20.189> stay<00:00:20.730> together<00:00:21.090> better<00:00:21.539> after

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
because they stay together better after

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.970 
have your pot boiling nice and hot and
some<00:00:59.969> salt<00:01:00.300> on<00:01:00.480> hand<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:01.170> want<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.530> salt<00:01:01.800> the

some salt on hand you want to salt the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.709 
some salt on hand you want to salt the
water<00:01:02.250> because<00:01:03.120> that's<00:01:03.270> really<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.690> only

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
water because that's really the only

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.500 
water because that's really the only
time<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.650> potatoes<00:01:05.070> will<00:01:05.309> take<00:01:06.299> on<00:01:06.479> a

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
time that the potatoes will take on a

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.429 
time that the potatoes will take on a
lot<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.930> flavor

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
lot of flavor

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.859 
lot of flavor
is<00:01:07.500> by<00:01:07.890> salting<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:08.820> dump<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.240> lot<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.600> salt

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
is by salting it so dump a lot of salt

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.410 
is by salting it so dump a lot of salt
in<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.170> water<00:01:10.350> after<00:01:10.670> the<00:01:11.670> water<00:01:11.909> has<00:01:12.180> boiled

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
in the water after the water has boiled

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.179 
in the water after the water has boiled
if<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.810> put<00:01:12.990> salt<00:01:13.320> in<00:01:13.530> when<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.830> water<00:01:14.040> is

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
if you put salt in when the water is

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.859 
if you put salt in when the water is
cold<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.700> will<00:01:14.790> take<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.210> water<00:01:15.330> longer<00:01:15.780> to

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
cold it will take the water longer to

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.170 
cold it will take the water longer to
boil<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.830> let<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.250> water<00:01:17.430> come<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.759> boil<00:01:17.939> then

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
boil so let the water come to boil then

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.440 
boil so let the water come to boil then
add<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.509> salt<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.049> I'll<00:01:19.619> do<00:01:19.860> about<00:01:20.450> two

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
add the salt and I'll do about two

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.660 
add the salt and I'll do about two
tablespoons<00:01:22.200> maybe<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:23.040> little<00:01:23.400> less<00:01:23.610> than

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
tablespoons maybe a little less than

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.170 
tablespoons maybe a little less than
that<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.920> salt<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.340> you'll<00:01:26.640> notice<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.030> the

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
that of salt and you'll notice that the

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.819 
that of salt and you'll notice that the
water<00:01:27.390> will<00:01:27.600> kind<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.840> stop<00:01:28.049> boil<00:01:28.380> in<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.590> little

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
water will kind of stop boil in a little

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.109 
water will kind of stop boil in a little
bit<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.159> then<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.430> want<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.610> give<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.850> just<00:01:29.880> a

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
bit and then you want to give it just a

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.469 
bit and then you want to give it just a
second<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.509> come<00:01:30.659> back<00:01:31.220> and<00:01:32.220> then<00:01:33.000> we'll<00:01:33.180> plonk

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
second to come back and then we'll plonk

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.160 
second to come back and then we'll plonk
the<00:01:33.689> potatoes<00:01:34.140> in<00:01:35.360> gently<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.079> don't

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
the potatoes in gently so you don't

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:44.220 
the potatoes in gently so you don't
splash<00:01:37.619> yourself<00:01:42.049> alright

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.230 
splash yourself alright

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.980 
splash yourself alright
so<00:01:45.230> I'll<00:01:45.830> check<00:01:46.100> those<00:01:46.310> and<00:01:46.370> about<00:01:46.760> I'll<00:01:47.750> check

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
so I'll check those and about I'll check

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.270 
so I'll check those and about I'll check
them<00:01:48.110> in<00:01:48.200> five<00:01:48.410> just<00:01:48.800> to<00:01:48.920> see<00:01:49.070> how<00:01:49.160> they're

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
them in five just to see how they're

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.710 
them in five just to see how they're
looking<00:01:49.430> poke<00:01:49.850> them<00:01:50.000> with<00:01:50.030> a<00:01:50.150> fork<00:01:50.480> and<00:01:50.600> we

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
looking poke them with a fork and we

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.860 
looking poke them with a fork and we
want<00:01:51.320> the<00:01:51.410> fork<00:01:51.650> to<00:01:52.390> go<00:01:53.390> in<00:01:53.540> and<00:01:53.720> come<00:01:53.840> out

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:53.870 
want the fork to go in and come out

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.350 
want the fork to go in and come out
loosely<00:01:54.350> you<00:01:54.620> don't<00:01:54.800> want<00:01:54.920> to<00:01:54.979> have<00:01:55.070> any

loosely you don't want to have any
resistance<00:01:56.360> with<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:56.660> fork<00:01:57.280> okay<00:01:58.280> let's

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
resistance with the fork okay let's

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.760 
resistance with the fork okay let's
check<00:01:58.910> those<00:01:59.120> in<00:01:59.330> five<00:01:59.510> okay<00:02:00.229> the<00:02:00.380> potatoes

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770
