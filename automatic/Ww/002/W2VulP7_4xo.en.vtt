trouble<00:00:10.860> keeping<00:00:11.519> it<00:00:11.580> under<00:00:11.759> 10<00:00:12.120> minutes<00:00:12.389> long

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
trouble keeping it under 10 minutes long

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.470 
trouble keeping it under 10 minutes long
so<00:00:13.230> I'm<00:00:13.650> not<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:13.860> YouTube<00:00:14.190> partner<00:00:14.370> as<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:15.210> today

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
so I'm not a YouTube partner as of today

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.109 
so I'm not a YouTube partner as of today
so<00:00:16.109> I<00:00:16.139> will<00:00:16.350> have<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:16.650> after<00:00:17.460> experiment<00:00:17.910> later

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
so I will have to after experiment later

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.700 
so I will have to after experiment later
probably<00:00:18.449> put<00:00:18.750> it<00:00:18.840> in<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:19.020> video<00:00:19.199> series

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
probably put it in a video series

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.240 
probably put it in a video series
instead<00:00:20.340> of<00:00:20.550> one<00:00:20.850> long<00:00:21.150> 12<00:00:21.930> minute<00:00:22.289> video<00:00:22.410> so

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
instead of one long 12 minute video so

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.710 
instead of one long 12 minute video so

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
side so I went out and bought myself a

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.569 
side so I went out and bought myself a
four<00:00:51.030> gig<00:00:51.210> micro<00:00:51.660> SD<00:00:52.020> card<00:00:52.260> by<00:00:52.410> SanDisk<00:00:53.010> and

four gig micro SD card by SanDisk and

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.240 
four gig micro SD card by SanDisk and
this<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.030> relatively<00:00:54.420> fast<00:00:54.750> flash<00:00:55.230> memory<00:00:55.680> but

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
this is relatively fast flash memory but

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.650 
this is relatively fast flash memory but
basically<00:00:56.610> if<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:56.820> wanted<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.180> insert<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.539> into

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
basically if I wanted to insert it into

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.170 
basically if I wanted to insert it into
the<00:00:57.809> phone<00:00:58.050> it's<00:00:58.680> very<00:00:58.829> very<00:00:59.010> simple<00:00:59.280> I'll<00:00:59.969> try

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
the phone it's very very simple I'll try

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.939 
the phone it's very very simple I'll try
to<00:01:00.239> show<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.510> guys<00:01:00.690> at<00:01:00.899> an<00:01:00.989> angle<00:01:01.289> here<00:01:01.530> you

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
to show you guys at an angle here you

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.399 
to show you guys at an angle here you
just<00:01:02.100> kind<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.460> slide<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.910> in<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:04.199> phone

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
just kind of slide it in and the phone

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.870 
just kind of slide it in and the phone
actually<00:01:04.739> does<00:01:04.890> light<00:01:05.129> up<00:01:05.309> because<00:01:05.790> it

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
actually does light up because it

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.500 
actually does light up because it
realizes<00:01:06.330> you've<00:01:06.510> inserted<00:01:06.840> some<00:01:07.260> storage<00:01:07.650> so

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
realizes you've inserted some storage so

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.210 
realizes you've inserted some storage so
there<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.570> go<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:10.560> just<00:01:10.799> closed<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.130> up

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
there you go and I just closed it up

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.910 
there you go and I just closed it up
there<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:12.420> memories<00:01:12.780> in<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.080> phone<00:01:13.320> now

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
there and the memories in the phone now

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.090 
there and the memories in the phone now
I<00:01:13.950> do<00:01:14.100> use<00:01:14.430> this<00:01:14.610> micro<00:01:15.479> SD<00:01:15.750> card<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.080> with<00:01:16.920> all

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
I do use this micro SD card to with all

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.429 
I do use this micro SD card to with all
the<00:01:17.250> memory<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.689> entire<00:01:18.930> phone<00:01:19.170> basically

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
the memory of the entire phone basically

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.590 
the memory of the entire phone basically
so<00:01:20.189> if<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.400> were<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.580> put<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.820> new<00:01:21.030> song<00:01:21.240> on<00:01:21.479> the

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
so if I were to put a new song on the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.899 
so if I were to put a new song on the
phone<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.990> would<00:01:22.080> put<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.470> on<00:01:22.560> micro<00:01:22.890> SD<00:01:23.159> card<00:01:23.400> if

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
phone I would put it on micro SD card if

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.520 
phone I would put it on micro SD card if
I<00:01:24.090> were<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.270> take<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.479> new<00:01:24.689> couple<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.320> pictures
