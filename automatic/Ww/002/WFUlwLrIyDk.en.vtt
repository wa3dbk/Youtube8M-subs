 hello how about this video let's see how 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.230
 make some homemade fritters 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:09.690
 traditional with pumpkin 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.160
 here I go to the two ingredients that 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.770
 we will employ to make these children 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.770
 like the pumpkin roasted the yeast 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:22.670
 wheat scrape wheat flour 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.670
 wheat flour 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.890
 the area 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.519
 with a latina 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.519
 A) Yes 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.949
 with the life 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.840
 this dough will be left to rest for 30 or 

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:26.210
 45 minutes to really really 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.670
 it is not the definitive mass with which 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.530
 the muleteers elaborated 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.600
 here you can see the look of let's 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:37.560
 once he has rested 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.369
 to fermented for half an hour or 342 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.369
 approximately 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.810
 this is the utensil that we will spend for 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.810
 make the donuts you want 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.950
 puyol was 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:14.720
 it's about getting a pasta that's 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:17.350
 well to be able to throw it into the bathtub 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.940
 and throw it to the pan 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.720
 Anyway, we will be testing the 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:25.860
 pasta and it will be a test donut for 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.860
 see if you get more water 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.810
 there are times when we go note 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.510
 here you can see the textures how they have 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.510
 left 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.050
 the pumpkin inside 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.870
 because good is what gives throw them a little 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.280
 of sugar 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.660
 and enjoy them 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.660

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.549
