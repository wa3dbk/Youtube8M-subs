00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
think in this tank here alone I really

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:59.220 
think in this tank here alone I really
wish<00:02:57.069> I<00:02:57.250> you<00:02:57.579> could<00:02:58.540> appreciate<00:02:58.810> how

wish I you could appreciate how
beautiful<00:02:59.799> these<00:03:00.030> angelfish<00:03:01.030> are<00:03:01.239> the

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
beautiful these angelfish are the

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.780 
beautiful these angelfish are the
problem<00:03:01.930> with<00:03:02.079> angelfish<00:03:02.500> is<00:03:02.560> they<00:03:03.549> grow

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
problem with angelfish is they grow

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.509

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
larger than most people have tanks for I

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.750

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
think that they do best in tanks that

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.970 
think that they do best in tanks that
are<00:03:09.910> over<00:03:10.660> 50<00:03:10.840> gallon<00:03:12.870> just<00:03:13.870> see<00:03:14.829> the

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
are over 50 gallon just see the
