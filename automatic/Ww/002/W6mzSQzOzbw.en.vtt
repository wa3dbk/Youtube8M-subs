it's 1985 and today we're gonna take a
look<00:00:05.009> at<00:00:05.220> construct<00:00:06.000> BOTS<00:00:06.379> dinobot<00:00:07.379> strafe

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:08.660 
look at construct BOTS dinobot strafe

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.000 
look at construct BOTS dinobot strafe
strafe<00:00:09.660> here<00:00:09.809> as<00:00:09.960> you<00:00:10.050> can<00:00:10.080> see<00:00:10.200> in<00:00:10.500> his<00:00:10.740> beast

strafe here as you can see in his beast

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.470 
strafe here as you can see in his beast
form<00:00:11.250> is<00:00:11.429> a<00:00:11.460> two-headed<00:00:12.230> flying<00:00:13.340> dinosaur<00:00:14.480> so

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
form is a two-headed flying dinosaur so

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.140 
form is a two-headed flying dinosaur so
here<00:00:15.839> we<00:00:15.929> go<00:00:16.310> take<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.340> look<00:00:17.550> out<00:00:17.640> here<00:00:17.670> from<00:00:18.060> the

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
here we go take a look out here from the

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.290 
here we go take a look out here from the
side<00:00:19.340> little<00:00:20.340> 360<00:00:21.380> look<00:00:22.380> at<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:22.590> here<00:00:23.300> there

side little 360 look at it here there

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.019 
side little 360 look at it here there
are<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.480> two<00:00:24.660> heads<00:00:25.460> this<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:26.580> kind<00:00:26.789> of<00:00:26.820> how<00:00:26.939> it

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
are the two heads this is kind of how it

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.439 
are the two heads this is kind of how it
looks<00:00:27.180> from<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.420> top<00:00:27.449> here<00:00:28.130> and<00:00:29.390> here's<00:00:30.390> the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
looks from the top here and here's the

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.319 
looks from the top here and here's the
underside<00:00:31.260> you<00:00:31.820> can<00:00:32.820> see<00:00:33.000> what's<00:00:33.180> gonna

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
underside you can see what's gonna

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.030 
underside you can see what's gonna
happen<00:00:33.750> here<00:00:33.989> here's<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.620> chest<00:00:34.860> for<00:00:35.010> the

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
happen here here's the chest for the

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.860 
happen here here's the chest for the
robot<00:00:35.340> mode<00:00:35.489> these<00:00:35.670> are<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.910> legs<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.840> arms

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
robot mode these are the legs the arms

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.560 
robot mode these are the legs the arms
so<00:00:37.680> pretty<00:00:37.920> basic<00:00:38.100> transformation<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:39.360> does

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
so pretty basic transformation it does

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.880 
so pretty basic transformation it does
have<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.780> nice<00:00:39.930> gimmick<00:00:40.350> here<00:00:40.530> there's<00:00:40.829> a

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
have a nice gimmick here there's a

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.360 
have a nice gimmick here there's a
little<00:00:40.980> cog<00:00:41.309> here<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.930> move<00:00:42.930> up<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.170> down<00:00:43.370> the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
little cog here you move up and down the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.810 
little cog here you move up and down the
list<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.700> legs<00:00:44.879> with<00:00:46.190> you<00:00:47.190> do<00:00:47.340> have<00:00:47.579> that

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
list of the legs with you do have that

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.330 
list of the legs with you do have that
play<00:00:48.600> feature<00:00:48.840> there<00:00:49.140> just<00:00:49.559> kind<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.739> cool<00:00:51.199> so

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
play feature there just kind of cool so

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.970 
play feature there just kind of cool so
articulation<00:00:53.360> you've<00:00:54.360> got<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:55.050> ball<00:00:55.680> joint

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
articulation you've got a ball joint

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.360 
articulation you've got a ball joint
there<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.780> Paula<00:00:57.780> went<00:00:58.050> there<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.649> apologize

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
there a Paula went there and apologize

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.569 
there a Paula went there and apologize
their<00:00:59.660> ball<00:01:00.660> joint<00:01:00.989> ball<00:01:01.559> joint<00:01:01.890> ball<00:01:02.280> joint

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
their ball joint ball joint ball joint

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.960 
their ball joint ball joint ball joint
so<00:01:02.760> lots<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.120> articulation<00:01:03.780> in<00:01:04.739> beast<00:01:05.580> form<00:01:05.850> as

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
so lots of articulation in beast form as

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.179 
so lots of articulation in beast form as
well<00:01:06.090> as<00:01:06.270> robot<00:01:06.540> mode<00:01:06.689> now<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.439> do<00:01:07.799> have<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.010> say

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
well as robot mode now I do have to say

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.740 
well as robot mode now I do have to say
before<00:01:08.670> we<00:01:08.820> get<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.180> transformation<00:01:09.540> that

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
before we get to the transformation that

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.670 
before we get to the transformation that
for<00:01:10.500> some<00:01:10.650> reason<00:01:11.810> the<00:01:12.810> limbs<00:01:13.110> tend<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.530> fall

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
for some reason the limbs tend to fall

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.289 
for some reason the limbs tend to fall
off<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:13.979> don't<00:01:14.070> know<00:01:14.220> it's<00:01:14.400> just<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:15.000> the

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
off I don't know it's just the the

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.580 
off I don't know it's just the the
material<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.780> ball<00:01:15.930> joint<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:16.200> made<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.439> I

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
material the ball joint is made of I

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.560 
material the ball joint is made of I
have<00:01:17.220> several<00:01:17.520> other<00:01:17.670> construct<00:01:18.210> pots<00:01:18.360> and

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
have several other construct pots and

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.570 
have several other construct pots and
I've<00:01:18.630> had<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:19.020> have<00:01:19.350> not<00:01:19.530> had<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.860> problem<00:01:20.100> so

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
I've had I have not had that problem so

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.609 
I've had I have not had that problem so
I<00:01:20.610> don't<00:01:20.880> know<00:01:20.939> why<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.420> but<00:01:21.450> if<00:01:22.350> things

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
I don't know why that is but if things

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.490 
I don't know why that is but if things
start<00:01:22.950> falling<00:01:23.220> off<00:01:23.369> that's<00:01:23.610> why<00:01:24.229> so<00:01:25.229> first

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
start falling off that's why so first

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.859 
start falling off that's why so first
thing<00:01:25.710> we're<00:01:25.830> gonna<00:01:25.890> do<00:01:26.570> let's<00:01:27.570> go<00:01:27.659> ahead<00:01:27.720> and

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
thing we're gonna do let's go ahead and

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.539 
thing we're gonna do let's go ahead and
just<00:01:27.960> take<00:01:28.080> off<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.380> tail<00:01:28.530> here<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.400> tail

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
just take off the tail here the tail

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:30.980 
just take off the tail here the tail
actually<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:29.909> articulated<00:01:30.329> as<00:01:30.390> well<00:01:30.540> flips<00:01:30.869> on

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
actually is articulated as well flips on

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.990 
actually is articulated as well flips on
there<00:01:31.170> with<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.130> little<00:01:32.369> c-clip<00:01:33.110> move<00:01:34.110> that

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
there with a little c-clip move that

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.120 
there with a little c-clip move that
will<00:01:36.000> work<00:01:36.150> on<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.390> legs<00:01:36.570> first<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:38.009> is

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
will work on the legs first so this is

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.679 
will work on the legs first so this is
going<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.400> be<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.670> front<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.240> robot<00:01:39.390> mode

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
going to be the front of the robot mode

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.859 
going to be the front of the robot mode
so<00:01:40.409> what<00:01:40.619> we<00:01:40.680> need<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.860> do<00:01:40.979> first<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.869> rotate

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
so what we need to do first is rotate

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.010 
so what we need to do first is rotate
around<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.439> lower<00:01:43.680> part<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.220> leg<00:01:44.430> here<00:01:45.020> so

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
around the lower part of the leg here so

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.530 
around the lower part of the leg here so
you<00:01:46.140> have<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.710> dark<00:01:47.369> blue<00:01:47.700> armor<00:01:48.090> facing

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
you have the dark blue armor facing

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.109 
you have the dark blue armor facing
forward<00:01:49.520> like<00:01:50.520> that

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
forward like that

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.600 
forward like that
and<00:01:51.979> then<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.220> take<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:54.020> jaw<00:01:55.020> here<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.610> these

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
and then you take the jaw here and these

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.160 
and then you take the jaw here and these
become<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.600> feet<00:01:59.329> so<00:02:00.329> there<00:02:00.570> we<00:02:00.689> go<00:02:00.750> halfway

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
become the feet so there we go halfway

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.020 
become the feet so there we go halfway
done<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:03.110> now<00:02:04.110> focusing<00:02:04.710> on<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.890> arms<00:02:05.250> go

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
done so now focusing on the arms go

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.600 
done so now focusing on the arms go
ahead<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.299> bring<00:02:06.479> these<00:02:06.659> down<00:02:07.220> and<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.489> want

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
ahead and bring these down and you want

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.570 
ahead and bring these down and you want
to<00:02:08.700> rotate<00:02:08.849> around<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.869> lower<00:02:10.140> arm<00:02:10.500> such<00:02:11.340> that

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
to rotate around the lower arm such that

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.550 
to rotate around the lower arm such that
you<00:02:11.670> have<00:02:11.700> this<00:02:12.030> facing<00:02:12.239> forward

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
you have this facing forward

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.930 
you have this facing forward
and<00:02:14.560> we'll<00:02:14.860> do<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.069> same<00:02:15.099> thing<00:02:15.280> over<00:02:15.580> here<00:02:15.700> of

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
and we'll do the same thing over here of

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.550 
and we'll do the same thing over here of
course<00:02:16.590> these<00:02:17.590> are<00:02:17.650> all<00:02:17.830> ball<00:02:18.130> joints<00:02:18.550> and

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
course these are all ball joints and

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.580 
course these are all ball joints and
then<00:02:20.670> rotate<00:02:21.670> this<00:02:21.819> bit<00:02:21.970> back<00:02:22.209> the<00:02:23.200> side<00:02:23.380> you

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
then rotate this bit back the side you

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.400 
then rotate this bit back the side you
can<00:02:23.680> see<00:02:23.709> there<00:02:23.950> is<00:02:24.069> a<00:02:24.099> fist<00:02:24.489> right<00:02:24.730> there

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
can see there is a fist right there

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.120 
can see there is a fist right there
that's<00:02:26.410> formed<00:02:26.800> out<00:02:26.920> of<00:02:27.040> this<00:02:27.630> front<00:02:28.630> foot<00:02:29.130> and

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
that's formed out of this front foot and

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.620 
that's formed out of this front foot and
you<00:02:30.310> do<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.550> same<00:02:30.700> thing<00:02:31.000> of<00:02:31.209> course<00:02:31.420> over

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
you do the same thing of course over

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.729 
you do the same thing of course over
here<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:33.430> there<00:02:33.819> you<00:02:33.940> go<00:02:34.090> and<00:02:34.500> we<00:02:35.500> need<00:02:35.530> to

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
here and there you go and we need to

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.699 
here and there you go and we need to
rotate<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:36.130> head<00:02:36.250> around<00:02:36.430> first<00:02:37.260> and<00:02:38.260> there

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
rotate the head around first and there

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:44.580 
rotate the head around first and there
you<00:02:38.800> go<00:02:39.010> Hey<00:02:39.610> look<00:02:39.790> at<00:02:40.060> robot<00:02:40.450> mode<00:02:41.670> so<00:02:42.670> as<00:02:43.630> with

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
you go Hey look at robot mode so as with

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.050 
you go Hey look at robot mode so as with
a<00:02:44.860> lot<00:02:45.040> of<00:02:45.160> these<00:02:45.250> constraint<00:02:45.670> BOTS<00:02:45.850> they're

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
a lot of these constraint BOTS they're

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.250 
a lot of these constraint BOTS they're
larger<00:02:46.510> than<00:02:46.540> you<00:02:46.780> think

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
larger than you think

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.009 
larger than you think

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
Voyager Class figure of course this is

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.559 
Voyager Class figure of course this is

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
Voyager Class Springer and you can see

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.930 
Voyager Class Springer and you can see
he<00:02:55.930> is<00:02:55.959> comparable<00:02:56.890> actually<00:02:57.280> taller<00:02:57.549> than

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
he is comparable actually taller than

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.309 
he is comparable actually taller than

and<00:03:03.250> I<00:03:03.700> fail<00:03:04.239> to<00:03:04.360> mention<00:03:04.390> all<00:03:04.750> on<00:03:04.959> the<00:03:05.110> beast

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
and I fail to mention all on the beast

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.500 
and I fail to mention all on the beast
form<00:03:05.530> the<00:03:06.069> beast<00:03:06.280> farms<00:03:06.580> ruff<00:03:06.790> is<00:03:06.940> roughly<00:03:07.420> the

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
form the beast farms ruff is roughly the

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.360 
form the beast farms ruff is roughly the
size<00:03:07.660> of<00:03:07.989> Voyager<00:03:08.500> Class<00:03:08.620> B<00:03:09.010> so<00:03:09.069> hunters

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
size of Voyager Class B so hunters

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.130 
size of Voyager Class B so hunters
Predaking<00:03:09.910> the<00:03:10.090> first<00:03:10.299> Predaking<00:03:10.750> not<00:03:10.959> the

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
Predaking the first Predaking not the

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.250 
Predaking the first Predaking not the
simplified<00:03:12.099> larger<00:03:12.580> version<00:03:12.880> but<00:03:13.110> it's<00:03:14.110> a

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
simplified larger version but it's a

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.340 
simplified larger version but it's a
very<00:03:14.470> nice<00:03:14.709> size<00:03:15.010> is<00:03:15.459> the<00:03:15.580> point<00:03:15.790> here<00:03:15.970> so

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
very nice size is the point here so

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.610 
very nice size is the point here so
again<00:03:17.350> you<00:03:17.920> know<00:03:18.040> ball<00:03:18.250> jointed<00:03:18.609> head<00:03:19.620> their

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
again you know ball jointed head their

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.449 
again you know ball jointed head their
ball<00:03:21.280> joint<00:03:21.609> ball<00:03:21.880> joint<00:03:22.180> ball<00:03:23.109> joint<00:03:23.459> ball

in<00:03:26.920> ankles<00:03:27.540> so<00:03:28.540> you<00:03:29.290> know<00:03:29.380> you<00:03:29.470> got<00:03:29.590> a<00:03:29.620> wide

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
in ankles so you know you got a wide

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:31.770 
in ankles so you know you got a wide
range<00:03:30.160> of<00:03:30.280> possibility<00:03:30.760> options<00:03:31.120> with<00:03:31.540> those

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
range of possibility options with those

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.580 
range of possibility options with those
ball<00:03:32.019> joints<00:03:33.269> all<00:03:34.269> right<00:03:34.480> so<00:03:34.840> you<00:03:34.930> do<00:03:35.170> get<00:03:35.350> this

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
ball joints all right so you do get this

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.750 
ball joints all right so you do get this
sword<00:03:35.950> here<00:03:36.690> and<00:03:37.690> let's<00:03:38.049> see<00:03:38.200> this<00:03:38.319> goes<00:03:38.530> in

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
sword here and let's see this goes in

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.440 
sword here and let's see this goes in
like<00:03:39.760> this

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
like this

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.360 
like this
a<00:03:40.480> little<00:03:41.079> handle<00:03:41.319> right<00:03:41.500> there<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.859> grip<00:03:42.989> and

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
a little handle right there the grip and

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.599 
a little handle right there the grip and
like<00:03:45.370> that<00:03:45.609> and<00:03:46.090> then<00:03:46.299> you<00:03:46.359> got<00:03:47.220> this<00:03:48.220> type<00:03:48.579> of

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
like that and then you got this type of

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:50.640 
like that and then you got this type of
look<00:03:49.450> for<00:03:49.720> him<00:03:49.810> with<00:03:49.959> a<00:03:49.989> sword<00:03:50.350> which<00:03:50.530> is

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
look for him with a sword which is

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:57.240 
look for him with a sword which is
pretty<00:03:50.829> cool<00:03:54.269> so<00:03:55.269> yeah<00:03:55.420> pretty<00:03:56.200> cool<00:03:56.500> and<00:03:56.739> the

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
pretty cool so yeah pretty cool and the

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.620 
pretty cool so yeah pretty cool and the
gimmick<00:03:57.819> does<00:03:58.000> work<00:03:58.209> here<00:03:58.510> in<00:03:59.049> in<00:03:59.889> the<00:04:00.880> robot

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
gimmick does work here in in the robot

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:07.920 
gimmick does work here in in the robot
form<00:04:01.870> with<00:04:02.440> the<00:04:02.560> wings<00:04:04.079> it's<00:04:05.079> pretty<00:04:05.290> cool

so<00:04:08.560> let's<00:04:08.980> take<00:04:09.129> a<00:04:09.189> look<00:04:09.310> at<00:04:09.459> really<00:04:09.879> nice

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
so let's take a look at really nice

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.819 
so let's take a look at really nice
interesting<00:04:10.900> looking<00:04:11.110> head<00:04:11.379> sculpt<00:04:11.650> there

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
interesting looking head sculpt there

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.039 
interesting looking head sculpt there
are<00:04:11.920> not<00:04:12.040> a<00:04:12.069> lot<00:04:12.159> of<00:04:12.310> detail<00:04:12.790> but<00:04:12.970> it's<00:04:13.900> very

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
are not a lot of detail but it's very

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:17.699 
are not a lot of detail but it's very
simplified<00:04:14.549> but<00:04:15.549> it's<00:04:15.700> very<00:04:16.380> looks<00:04:17.380> very<00:04:17.590> good

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
simplified but it's very looks very good

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.920 
simplified but it's very looks very good
and<00:04:17.769> at<00:04:17.919> the<00:04:18.009> same<00:04:18.160> time<00:04:18.340> so<00:04:18.729> and<00:04:19.570> then<00:04:19.870> you

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930

although I think you can probably have

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.060 
although I think you can probably have
younger<00:04:37.509> folks<00:04:37.810> your<00:04:38.229> kids<00:04:38.410> do<00:04:38.590> that<00:04:38.770> as<00:04:38.919> well

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
I don't think it's that difficult to put
