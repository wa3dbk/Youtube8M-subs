hi<00:00:01.680> this<00:00:02.129> is<00:00:02.190> Lego<00:00:02.700> polymer<00:00:03.210> and<00:00:03.510> this<00:00:04.080> is<00:00:04.230> my

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
hi this is Lego polymer and this is my

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.730 
hi this is Lego polymer and this is my
first<00:00:04.650> video<00:00:04.859> and<00:00:05.390> all<00:00:06.390> you<00:00:06.480> need<00:00:06.690> is<00:00:07.020> this<00:00:07.470> in

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
first video and all you need is this in

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.000 
first video and all you need is this in
quebec<00:00:08.220> i<00:00:08.580> will<00:00:08.910> zoom<00:00:08.940> in<00:00:09.360> so<00:00:10.320> you<00:00:10.410> cannot<00:00:10.710> see

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
quebec i will zoom in so you cannot see

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.049 
quebec i will zoom in so you cannot see
them<00:00:11.070> properly<00:00:12.530> these<00:00:13.530> bits<00:00:13.889> here<00:00:13.980> you<00:00:14.880> can

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
them properly these bits here you can

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.260 
them properly these bits here you can
get<00:00:15.240> from<00:00:15.420> like<00:00:15.630> there<00:00:16.529> go<00:00:16.680> around<00:00:17.039> places<00:00:17.820> we

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
get from like there go around places we

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.429 
get from like there go around places we
two<00:00:18.510> very<00:00:18.810> simple<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.380> that<00:00:21.080> make<00:00:22.080> sure<00:00:22.289> that

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
two very simple to that make sure that

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.400 
two very simple to that make sure that
that<00:00:22.920> one<00:00:23.189> has<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.460> hole<00:00:23.760> in<00:00:23.789> it<00:00:25.609> step<00:00:26.609> one<00:00:27.410> third

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
that one has a hole in it step one third

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.170 
that one has a hole in it step one third
in<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.710> base<00:00:30.439> this<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.859> simple<00:00:32.399> bit<00:00:32.579> or<00:00:32.910> I've

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
in the base this is simple bit or I've

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.130 
in the base this is simple bit or I've
done<00:00:33.210> is<00:00:33.690> put<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:33.989> two<00:00:34.530> by<00:00:34.710> four<00:00:34.739> piece<00:00:35.340> on<00:00:35.670> top

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
done is put a two by four piece on top

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.540 
done is put a two by four piece on top
of<00:00:37.140> two<00:00:37.980> wheelbases<00:00:38.780> two<00:00:39.780> wheels<00:00:40.110> on<00:00:40.290> them<00:00:41.219> on

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
of two wheelbases two wheels on them on

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.020 
of two wheelbases two wheels on them on
to<00:00:42.180> part<00:00:42.510> two<00:00:43.280> which<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.430> will<00:00:44.640> show<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.879> how

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
to part two which I will show you how

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.860 
to part two which I will show you how
dem<00:00:45.660> strike<00:00:46.050> egg<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:47.059> get<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.570> piece

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
dem strike egg to it get that piece

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.910 
dem strike egg to it get that piece
there<00:00:48.920> which<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.129> like<00:00:50.719> that<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.219> then<00:00:54.920> that

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
there which is like that and then that

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.740 
there which is like that and then that
piece<00:00:56.660> plus<00:00:57.660> what<00:00:57.870> one<00:00:58.789> directly<00:00:59.789> on<00:01:00.239> bottom

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
piece plus what one directly on bottom

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.200 
piece plus what one directly on bottom
of<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.230> middle<00:01:03.019> and<00:01:04.019> there<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.769> are<00:01:05.210> there

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
of the middle and there you are there

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.130 
of the middle and there you are there
then<00:01:06.450> for<00:01:07.439> me<00:01:07.590> roblox<00:01:08.400> head<00:01:09.710> get<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:11.549> piece

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
then for me roblox head get that piece

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.950 
then for me roblox head get that piece

there you are that you know the robots
head<00:01:30.030> on<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.470> base<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:32.430> then<00:01:33.500> click

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
head on to that base and then click

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.120 
head on to that base and then click
continue<00:01:34.770> around<00:01:36.560> then<00:01:37.560> just<00:01:37.799> place<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.490> one

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.080 

for<00:01:58.700> that<00:01:59.350> as<00:02:00.350> for<00:02:00.560> the<00:02:00.620> robots<00:02:00.980> arms<00:02:01.220> get<00:02:01.940> 1

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
for that as for the robots arms get 1

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.730 
for that as for the robots arms get 1
million<00:02:02.270> pieces<00:02:02.690> and<00:02:03.490> one<00:02:04.490> of<00:02:04.610> them<00:02:05.560> you<00:02:06.560> did

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
million pieces and one of them you did

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:13.780 
million pieces and one of them you did
not<00:02:06.860> see<00:02:07.070> that<00:02:07.100> clearly<00:02:07.760> there<00:02:08.479> it<00:02:08.600> is<00:02:12.790> just

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
not see that clearly there it is just

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.850 
not see that clearly there it is just
add<00:02:14.060> them<00:02:14.330> onto<00:02:14.540> there<00:02:14.870> like<00:02:15.080> that<00:02:15.290> and<00:02:15.650> then

add them onto there like that and then

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.160 
add them onto there like that and then
put<00:02:16.100> them<00:02:16.250> inside<00:02:16.930> of<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.920> robots<00:02:19.310> head<00:02:20.170> then

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
put them inside of the robots head then

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.920 
put them inside of the robots head then
that<00:02:21.770> is<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.459> robot<00:02:22.850> done<00:02:23.560> and<00:02:25.390> if<00:02:26.390> you<00:02:26.450> want

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
that is the robot done and if you want

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.040 
that is the robot done and if you want
you<00:02:27.380> could<00:02:27.560> change<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.970> crew<00:02:29.209> of<00:02:29.480> your<00:02:29.690> robot

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
you could change the crew of your robot

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.120 
you could change the crew of your robot

one of my other creations that I have

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.940 
one of my other creations that I have
built<00:02:45.940> and<00:02:46.940> it<00:02:47.120> has<00:02:48.489> walking<00:02:49.489> step<00:02:50.770> little<00:02:51.770> man

and I've also built over stuff but you

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.360 
and I've also built over stuff but you
will<00:03:01.519> see<00:03:01.700> in<00:03:01.880> my<00:03:02.030> other<00:03:02.180> video
