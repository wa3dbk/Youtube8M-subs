00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:10.220
 did not miss 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.070
 your heart rate is 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:31.490
 accelerated 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:35.710
 Tell me the guys on the channel today? 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:38.510
 bruce day you yes no more about the link 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.570
 just that the all-seeing blind 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.420
 almost impossible to catch this canadian 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.190
 go because he if he puts haiti goes 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.350
 to the air back at least one old 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.540
 enemy back on ally goes on nexus 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.059
 back inhibitor goes from maria do it for 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.850
 where the back and nexus and after that 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.070
 back to speak again 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.440
 after this crazy trip and the beginning of 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.870
 Let's talk a little about this video. 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.750
 fragment and the zig zag maroto right there 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.390
 well the licensing it is the champion more 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.660
 used in lig django today 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:15.560
 and please people play smart cash 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:18.140
 khune yes because the advantage is absurd 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.679
 You do not need to look at the ball. 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.740
 on the opponent is very advantageous 

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:27.410
 well let's talk a little bit now about the 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.319
 good ruins by human ego 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.840
 the good streets for them yes are six 

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:36.080
 armor penetration marks three 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:39.590
 attack damage marks nine seals 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.679
 Armor 9 Magic Stamina Seals 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.179
 3rd quintessence of attack damage 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:47.090
 thus making your blows have 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:50.509
 very consistency and you have a good 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.709
 defense in clashes when the talents 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.110
 of leasing 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:57.410
 taking away the fact that he is blind and kills 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:02.929
 general in the dark type, it's already fucking alright 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:03.860
 but his tree talent is 2190 because 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:05.750
 and this 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.110
 you doing 21 90 you 're going to have one 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.450
 aspect off tank with defense and a little 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.489
 damage and the fact that the licensing 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.610
 a melee he needs more 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:19.400
 defense to take so much damage so does 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.200
 spells as are the spells that 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.370
 I recommend for extinction 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.560
 smith and flash because more by the fact 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.080
 of it being a django this is kind of obvious and 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.540
 the flash to help both catch 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.799
 that enemy running away and killing him or 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.650
 run away from him 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.269
 it is also important to remember that you have 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.299
 players who do not use the slice 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:44.090
 leasing who can beat it 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:47.629
 who can stop the blind is the greatest 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.670
 chaos to have it's traffic or why ow 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:52.700
 transit or remove any type of 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.230
 be without a large area causing 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.859
 the body of the garbage in almost does not fill 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.900
 effect and it because it integrates them 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:03.260
 ball in the traffic or goes towards 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.299
 to the coach and down slow if another team is 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.159
 in the area of his w and the traffic will 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.920
 to run after the five has to him because 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:13.069
 the effect will be greatly reduced and it is not only 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:16.069
 that's the mark the transall makes 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:18.560
 on the floor it greatly removes the effects 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:21.489
 of the 66 of various stamps 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:25.489
 Now let's talk a little about who 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:27.709
 he who changes who gives a character the 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:31.400
 licensing it takes advantage to find 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:34.489
 Cali it is incredible that it looks like the 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.310
 beef because the two are the champions 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:40.540
 very quick but he takes it takes 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:43.489
 advantage because of its area slogan 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.500
 then the twilight zone did not 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.389
 much effect and it can easily of 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.940
 What lesson do I have with w? 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:52.430
 Let's go because the meat is on x1 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.510
 Yes, control that twilight zone. 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.489
 them the ball intact unintentionally hit 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.169
 That's where he begins to feel. 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:03.079
 contribute inside the field area with 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:05.900
 she already gives the enem area and I in a 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:07.849
 another case if the charge and via try to vote 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.489
 yes he can escape with the 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:14.120
 and you can also escape with the 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:16.699
 wt reporting us an ally an art 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.760
 then I reverse them by messing her up well 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:21.470
 cool but if there is someone who can take 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.849
 some advantage against which he had to 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:28.099
 that is so the danger is the street is the leasing 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:30.680
 now let's talk about the advantages and 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:33.860
 the disadvantages of leasing as well as 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.199
 advantages of leasing start there 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.570
 he is a good team that if he is only in the 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:40.729
 top is very strong he can also 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.190
 easily hit head-on with any 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:47.479
 just the top up there obviously 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:50.569
 find he comes and he can not be 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:53.270
 so effective but it's a great 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:55.789
 just the touch the second advantage is that it 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.099
 is extremely fast and it is a 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:00.979
 killer born then when you least 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:02.360
 wait seven draws he feels focus and 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:04.309
 he has the help of someone 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.550
 You're hardly going to leave alive. 

00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:10.039
 the third advantage of it is that it forms 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.889
 So much so, he said. 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:15.559
 accelerated and he gets his items from 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:18.529
 way faster than others 

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:20.749
 The fourth advantage is that he has 

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:23.599
 life robbery and gives many have to 

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:27.020
 remain in combat or even in the 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:29.389
 django well speak at a disadvantage when 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:32.599
 it is very difficult illegal 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:35.209
 the disadvantages are quite relative then 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:37.550
 so disadvantage that I found that I 

00:05:35.209 --> 00:05:40.219
 I could quote here in his video as 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:42.649
 he is a very good kind of the only 

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:45.469
 disadvantage is that I found it is if you are 

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:50.300
 with the ball op as a country girl speaks 

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:52.639
 That's his ball and you can go wrong. 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.039
 be very dangerous or if you hit 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:57.349
 can also be very dangerous because 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:06:00.229
 You hit and it's going to seal for a 

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:03.589
 download and have five faces of the tinguÃ¡ you 

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:06.050
 died understood then it is the only 

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:08.749
 disadvantage of him is the player who plays with 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:11.539
 he has know the right time and I had a 

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:13.999
 sure to hit the ball and up 

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:16.849
 Yours really well 

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:19.339

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:22.159
 channel wanted to thank the collaboration of 

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:23.719

 video favorite is being 

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:27.709
 extremely important for the 

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:28.430
 dissemination of the channel and its growth 

00:06:27.709 --> 00:06:30.919
