since I got out of the hospital from my
autologous<00:00:15.059> stem<00:00:15.090> cell<00:00:15.540> transplant<00:00:16.170> as<00:00:16.849> most

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:17.849 
autologous stem cell transplant as most

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:19.850 
autologous stem cell transplant as most
of<00:00:18.000> you<00:00:18.090> now<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.330> I<00:00:19.140> have<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.529> do<00:00:19.650> two

transplants one being the autologous

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.080 
transplants one being the autologous
stem<00:00:24.900> cell<00:00:25.289> transplant<00:00:25.830> but<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.010> just<00:00:26.250> did<00:00:26.490> and

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
stem cell transplant but I just did and

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.090 
stem cell transplant but I just did and
then<00:00:27.900> we<00:00:28.050> have<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.289> follow<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.740> up<00:00:28.859> with<00:00:28.890> a

genetic stem cell transplant so as I
said<00:00:36.030> it's<00:00:36.360> been<00:00:36.480> about<00:00:36.630> four<00:00:36.930> weeks<00:00:36.989> or<00:00:37.440> so

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.580 
happen from the algae big stem cell
transplant<00:01:32.640> but<00:01:33.630> luckily<00:01:33.840> we've<00:01:34.079> got<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.320> donor

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
transplant but luckily we've got a donor

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.819 
transplant but luckily we've got a donor
perfect<00:01:35.280> match<00:01:35.460> donor<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.439> I've<00:01:37.439> got<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.650> lot

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829
