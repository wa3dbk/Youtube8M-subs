00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.460
 this is the first individual in the world 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.680
 electric vehicle 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.660
 go auto balancing inline 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.639
 sensors and computer support it 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.410
 means upright she 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.289
 able to reach speeds which 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.350
 three times the normal walking step these 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.850
 funds are ideal for large deposits 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:25.050
 courier services and simply and willing 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.180
 ride with the wind 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.310
 lightweight and durable materials allows 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.030
 vehicle to move you 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.100
 almost everywhere in the aluminum chassis 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.380
 placed electronics governing 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.540
 means she is able to withstand a blow 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.510
 force equivalent to the weight of three 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.820
 car using a clutch press 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.070
 are attached to two motors and clutches 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.899
 later will connect the motors with boxes 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.610
 gears for safety 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.890
 many device components from 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.020
 duplicated in normal circumstances they 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.730
 share the load but any 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.730
 of them will be able to work perfectly 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.160
 on their own if 2 fails to 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.530
 production is called 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:08.540
 redundant motors are attached to the chassis 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.540
 three bolts on each side 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.740
 then to the top of the highway 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:17.210
 two control boards are installed 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.300
 microprocessors in these boards control 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.040
 motors 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.290
 next to the body is set fee 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.570
 there are five balancing sensors 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.729
 gyroscopes and two components called 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.380
 liquid tilt sensors these 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.180
 tools measure position 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.490
 vehicle relative 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.040
 land boards take readings from instruments 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.560
 100 times per second and change direction 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.140
 movement of the means rotate the wheels forward 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.110
 or back when the rider leans into that 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.740
 or other side are set afterwards 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.140
 harnesses 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.530
 which connects the battery with the control 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.420
 coupling cover for chassis 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.460
 also plays the role of a platform in which 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.560
 worth the rider when you bet on it 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.869
 a leg under the weight of four 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.119
 rubber buttons it interrupts 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.340
 the optical beam on the board is reporting 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.800
 transporter that the passenger went to him 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:11.060
 harnesses and pull into the hole in the casing 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:13.160
 and fasten with eight bolts then 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.170
 burned out and connected to the transformer 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.180
 Based control couplings for 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.400
 battery recharge transformer 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.459
 consumes electricity with standard 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.239
 for home voltage 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.700
 inside gearbox 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.519
 4 gears communicate motor energy 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.049
 Gear wheels are chamfered 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.260
 for the conveyor to pick up speed 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:37.209
 smooth and smooth it smooths out the noise 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.739
 engine to relatively quiet drone 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.930
 working woman tight when riding boxes 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.500
 gears to the chassis using rubber 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.870
 hammer 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.790
 then it opens waterproof 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.030
 damper and cord is inserted 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.030
 power supplies 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.130
 she checks the electrical system 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:07.630
 then using 5 bolts fixed 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:09.850
 two plastic wings conical 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:19.510
 metal sleeve connects each 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:21.970
 the wheel with its gearbox is cast 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.250
 metal and rubber base 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.400
 covers the platform and snugly against 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.290
 turning both wings over the highway 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.600
 worker connects two batteries 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.850
 to the control board by connecting 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.570
 Batteries to a regular outlet need 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:39.160
 leave them for 8 hours to full charge 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.070
 transporter able to drive 38 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.840
 kilometers without reloading 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:46.000
 this machine is checking detection sensors 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.580
 passengers pushing in random 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.160
 order on the platform the total weight of the rider with 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.239
 luggage ranges from 45 to 118 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.010
 kilograms 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:58.080
 she also checks the wheels and motors 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.610
 on the control coupling 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.950
 set the steering wheel to control 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.620
 you need to turn the handle to the left or 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.330
 right motor to execute the command of rotating 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.549
 one wheel is faster than another 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.160
 wheels can rotate in reverse 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:15.130
 direction to turn 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.239
 ignition key conveyor with 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.489
 computer chip 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.310
 limit the speed of movement in 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.340
 For security reasons, keys are also set 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:27.390
 transporter mode slow medium or 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.390
 sharp turns 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:34.789
 and now the most interesting test drive for 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:37.220
 each transporter worker listens 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:42.620
 no extraneous noise and checks 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:44.660
 vibration and under gears he 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.270
 lets the conveyor up the sloping 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.580
 plane lifting angle can reach to 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.860
 20 degrees only after thorough 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.240
 check transporter can set off 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.580
 on your first exit 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:59.740
 and you are guaranteed a good mood and 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.740
 a lot of driving pleasure
