efforts<00:02:05.370> into<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.910> controls<00:02:06.380> because<00:02:07.380> you

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
efforts into the controls because you

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.160 
efforts into the controls because you
really<00:02:07.860> wanted<00:02:08.310> them<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.150> be<00:02:09.270> organic<00:02:09.600> organic

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
really wanted them to be organic organic

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.700 
really wanted them to be organic organic
in<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.650> sense<00:02:10.860> where<00:02:11.010> it's<00:02:11.160> natural<00:02:11.700> I<00:02:11.910> can<00:02:12.710> pull

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
in a sense where it's natural I can pull

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.910 
in a sense where it's natural I can pull
a<00:02:14.540> 360<00:02:15.540> control<00:02:16.110> lets<00:02:16.320> me<00:02:16.470> pull<00:02:16.770> them

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
a 360 control lets me pull them

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.860 
a 360 control lets me pull them
differently<00:02:17.490> than<00:02:17.730> my<00:02:17.910> friends<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.510> control

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
differently than my friends the control

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.410 
differently than my friends the control
are<00:02:19.050> really<00:02:19.320> deep<00:02:19.530> enough<00:02:19.830> for<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.420> define

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
are really deep enough for you to define

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.960 
are really deep enough for you to define
and<00:02:21.810> design<00:02:22.140> your<00:02:22.350> own<00:02:22.620> style<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.520> tricking

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
and design your own style of tricking
