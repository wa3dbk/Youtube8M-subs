00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.270
 Hi, I'm Miguel and today we're going to do a 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.120
 amd boxing 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:10.880
 I bought this cube in the chicane or 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:13.520
 store cost me only 8 dollars 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.770
 No shipping costs is free or 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.110
 for eight dollars you have this cube that 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:22.460
 As is good, you will have seen it in the 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:24.890
 title is the box club ok is club too 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.750
 that you can buy in mayfair sounds 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.220
 chicana or store and it's a like that the 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.930
 I knew for quite some time but 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.030
 I had never bought no 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.850
 I was not leaving for later and 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:41.100
 today is the day here we have the 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:44.359
 newspapers have been interesting 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.359
 they are announcements 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:53.010
 well here we have a little people in a 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.010
 party here is the cube 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.510
 some of you will already know it is 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.030
 a modification of a 3 by 3 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.059
 or is it a three by three with parts 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:07.869
 modified extensions etcetera here what 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:10.290
 we have let's set this aside to see the 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:10.290
 first turns 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.660
 you can tour quite well much better than 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.490
 What I expected was a bucket 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.200
 pretty loose like some I have 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.120
 for example the fisher's cube that I have 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.420
 It is very bad and I imagined it from that 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.870
 style but it's not 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.480
 for those who do not know 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.060
 how is this interpreted as a 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.070
 three times three then as follows 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.480
 if you look here 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.600
 this is the cross 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.030
 in a three times three, imagine this 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.960
 It is the cross 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:48.619
 what's happening here this piece this 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.350
 triangulito is added to older are 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.900
 stuck then what is the cross now 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.520
 is the most triangular cross here 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.520
 up the same the cross with this 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.710
 triangulito here the same this 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.030
 triangulito that are extended parts and 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.909
 what's up with the corners 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.710
 this would be a no corner and now it has 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.600
 added these two parts then the 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.600
 corner now is this whole piece 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.790
 another corner now is this is just 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.090
 cropped not a normal corner would be a 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.730
 square like that and it's cut in half 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.349
 another corner is this whole block 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.909
 is the normal corner with these two 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.930
 added parts and the last corner is 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:33.780
 this headquarters not if we look at the cross the 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.849
 edges the cross and the four corners is 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.670
 an extension a modification and what 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:41.459
 same goes with the white face 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.400
 then in this cube for example the 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.000
 pattern d 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.000
 of the 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:52.110
 from all the alternate pieces 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.510
 in this cube that was like that 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.110
 see remains a curious way the 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.110
 typical pattern 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.950
 as you already know this pattern 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.770
 in this cube is left like this we see that it is a 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.620
 pretty interesting way 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:12.430
 and for example the exchange pattern 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.430
 of centers 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.950
 the typical pattern 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:23.510
 this pattern as it is in this bucket 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:27.110
 in this cube that was like that 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:30.390
 to see well 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.100
 well and so 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.569
 then this is a good method for 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.160
 identify the centers if we do 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.260
 a book and we do not see clearly where 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.670
 we are applying this algorithm to 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.600
 exchange the centers and the pieces 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.430
 that have been exchanged are 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.560
 precisely the centers we see that is 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.180
 this rather curious way now 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.290
 let's undo it all to see 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:53.010
 how is a broken state that remains 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.580
 as we see the pieces to see the pieces 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.580
 quite 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.150
 quite rare does not quite embarrass 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.070
 Of course if we are not used to 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.270
 to solve it this seems like a very 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.130
 rare but it really is a three by three 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.450
 the difficulty that has greater then that 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.010
 they confuse because the corners are 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.350
 extended the edges too but if 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.910
 we concentrate it is resolved exactly 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.370
 just like a three by three and here we see 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.269
 the brand 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:20.269
 it is a good 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.490
 I have other cubes I think the 3 x 3 x 2 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.980
 crazy is this brand if I do not remember 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.990
 wrong 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.910
 a good brand because nothing has been this 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.139
 my unboxing and a little review of this 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.699
 Cube 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:34.169
 and nothing I hope you liked and we 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:34.169
 we see in another video
