and I can't turn it back on again so I

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.319 
and I can't turn it back on again so I
don't<00:00:46.800> know<00:00:46.890> why<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.129> happened<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.940> guess<00:00:48.210> I

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
don't know why that happened I guess I

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.000 
don't know why that happened I guess I
have<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.629> get<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.780> new<00:00:48.840> one<00:00:49.170> like<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.620> triggers

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
jam then I may have banged it off the

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.410 
jam then I may have banged it off the

awful<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.220> they're<00:01:26.460> always<00:01:26.670> made<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.240> be<00:01:27.360> a

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
awful and they're always made to be a

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.240 
awful and they're always made to be a
really<00:01:27.900> negative<00:01:28.170> team<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:28.920> know<00:01:28.979> they

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
really negative team and I know they

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.649 
really negative team and I know they
have<00:01:29.430> been<00:01:29.579> criticized<00:01:30.000> in<00:01:30.150> real<00:01:30.299> life<00:01:30.509> for

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
have been criticized in real life for

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.780 
have been criticized in real life for
playing<00:01:30.869> negative<00:01:31.320> football<00:01:31.710> but<00:01:32.310> sometimes

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
playing negative football but sometimes

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.609 
playing negative football but sometimes
Stoke<00:01:33.090> can<00:01:33.390> play<00:01:33.570> really<00:01:33.780> positive<00:01:34.320> football

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
Stoke can play really positive football

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.770 
Stoke can play really positive football
or<00:01:34.920> at<00:01:35.040> least<00:01:35.189> like<00:01:35.369> under<00:01:35.700> am<00:01:35.939> your<00:01:36.390> man<00:01:36.540> Tony

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
and they did do like at some points but

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.770 
and they did do like at some points but
whenever<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.400> play<00:01:41.610> them<00:01:41.790> on<00:01:41.880> FIFA<00:01:42.299> they<00:01:42.479> just

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
whenever I play them on FIFA they just

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.139 
whenever I play them on FIFA they just

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
but um that's pretty much the way that

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.830

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
the whistle on FIFA I assumed he was

the whistle on FIFA I assumed he was
offside<00:02:28.209> so<00:02:28.540> I<00:02:28.570> just<00:02:28.810> took<00:02:28.990> a<00:02:29.050> normal<00:02:29.590> shot<00:02:29.830> had

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
penalty and this time I didn't think

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.400 
penalty and this time I didn't think
he'd<00:04:35.330> go<00:04:35.510> down<00:04:35.720> the<00:04:35.870> middle<00:04:36.020> this<00:04:36.200> time<00:04:36.260> I

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
he'd go down the middle this time I

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:37.660 
he'd go down the middle this time I
didn't<00:04:36.650> think<00:04:36.770> he'd<00:04:36.860> be<00:04:36.890> stupid<00:04:37.160> enough<00:04:37.400> to<00:04:37.580> do

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.670 
didn't think he'd be stupid enough to do

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.280 
didn't think he'd be stupid enough to do
it<00:04:37.820> but<00:04:38.000> he<00:04:38.060> was<00:04:38.210> and<00:04:38.540> he<00:04:38.600> scored<00:04:38.870> so<00:04:39.140> I<00:04:39.200> guess

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
it but he was and he scored so I guess

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.750 
it but he was and he scored so I guess
I'm<00:04:39.560> the<00:04:39.590> stupid<00:04:39.920> one<00:04:39.950> for<00:04:40.220> not<00:04:40.340> staying<00:04:40.550> in

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760
