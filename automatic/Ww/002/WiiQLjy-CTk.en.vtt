00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.860
 the alive and brown 92 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.250
 and very varas to all vaquitas welcome 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.110
 to a new tutorial of tricks for 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.460
 minecraft and in this tutorial I'm going to 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.070
 explain how to be able to place you 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.950
 any block in your player's head 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.300
 of minecraft is worth it in this way because I 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.590
 right now I'm carrying the crystal that shows 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.200
 when I do not have oxygen I'm 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.669
 literally drowning but good you 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.410
 you can place any block and this 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:28.570
 ball because you can make team 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.730
 battles and for example a battle that 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.349
 would be the people who wear diamond in the 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.050
 head the diamond block against another 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.810
 people who carry the gold block by 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.150
 example and it's really cool to start 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.160
 do this is with a simple command that 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.770
 I will explain and well first we are going to 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.710
 get the command block table that 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.900
 to get it you put your name 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.230
 from minecraft player we put 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:56.920
 minecraft two points comma to work 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:59.230
 blog is ok and here we have the little tables 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.390
 command blocks what we do is 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.790
 Now place it quickly with a button 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.009
 and now we put the command that you 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.870
 allows to do this that is simply 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:09.640
 this one you have to the description what 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.680
 does it replace the entity 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.270
 of the slot tree head and it places you 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.060
 block that you want the one you want 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.220
 ok then we accept you I'm going to 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.740
 explain a trick to see all the 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.869
 names of the blocks you will be 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.909
 seeing that when I get on top of the 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.259
 block tells me the block number here 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.750
 for example it tells me that the block of 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:31.690
 grass is number two and that the name 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:35.050
 real blog block is minecraft 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.369
 two greasy points and this is super comfortable 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.520
 because I do not have to go to the internet 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.290
 look for the name king or anything is worth 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.340
 example the diamond block here is 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:48.490
 would be number 57 and the real name of the 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.289
 block is called diamond block voucher and 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.050
 to do this you are going to see that 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:55.270
 if you try, it's not going to come out because there's 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.310
 to put a thing and expel 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.229
 efe 3 + h 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.000
 Now what I have done is turn it off 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.979
 you see, now he tells me that 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.380
 grass but it does not tell me anything I want 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.929
 know what number he has and what real name 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.410
 have to do it again I return to 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.709
 repeat 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.510
 efe 3 + h 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.580
 This is what I have been doing for 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.590
 a lot of time now it's back to me 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.209
 leave the real name we want 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.700
 put something on, you just get in 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.790
 in the block and here we could all 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.380
 we can have if there is not, let's see 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.420
 it looks like I'm going to explode in any 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.400
 small moment and this would be for example 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.920
 the tnt there are blocks that are blocked 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.010
 the cactus is searched you are going to see that if 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.200
 I put cactus 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.180
 you are going to see that what happens is that 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.459
 merges with the scooter and with the rays 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.970
 of super saiyan and it's because the block in 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:49.069
 the tree occupies very little very little space 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.670
 then I'm left with this guy 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.650
 I seem crazy and it is super bug more 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.209
 superchulo blocks would be the crystal 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.710
 it is very well worth the crystal would be 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.820
 put the 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:04.190
 we accept and I seem justifying it seems 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.170
 I'm a sailor, so I'm going to 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.940
 dive into the bar or something like that where there is 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.340
 water where there is water here there is water me 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:14.900
 shot and good looks like I'm showing 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:18.080
 like a damn crazy dude and the club 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.640
 let's try the cloister the close tom 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.860
 how did you put the good name back 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:27.320
 I hope it's little like that would be close tone 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.970
 we accept and place cloister is not 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.500
 the club block this has to be 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.020
 all blocks if they are not blocks no 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.430
 the product works at night in case 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.620
 someone is thinking they do not light up 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.720
 you think this lights up at night 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.520
 that is not simply an entity that does not 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.850
 has object function 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.440
 simply it placed and already and is 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.710
 very cool but it does not light up 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.380
 neither if you look at it 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:53.200
 how this object was called the light of 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.240
 sea is rare, so it is also 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.220
 very cool object you can choose the one that 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:00.640
 you want this is also very good be 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:06.100
 we are going to try it to see the pencil 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:09.850
 pencil block to see if it works if I 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.530
 I look like something weird and so with all the 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.260
 blocks that you want with the stone going 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:18.880

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:20.590
 rock press and us pet rock 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.480
 interruptible nobody to leave in 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:26.080
 the head ever because this block is 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:28.360
 good the strongest of all minecraft and 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.220
 So with all the blocks, it's already you 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.410

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.820
 club sun you can also get good 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.820
 this can already be placed 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.800

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.980
