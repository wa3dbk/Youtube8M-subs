00:00:08.993 --> 00:00:13.833
 Welcome to this Nespresso video guide for use 

00:00:14.037 --> 00:00:16.889
 of your Rapid Cappuccino System. 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.015
 To achieve perfect milk foam, time after time, 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.530
 We recommend that you follow some simple instructions. 

00:00:25.273 --> 00:00:29.421
 Turn on your machine and let it warm up for 25 seconds. 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.701
 To prepare a Cappuccino or a Latte Macchiato, 

00:00:34.291 --> 00:00:37.522
 fill the milk container with the desired amount of milk. 

00:00:38.188 --> 00:00:41.878
 We recommend using whole milk or light milk 

00:00:42.047 --> 00:00:46.082
 at refrigerator temperature (about 4 ° C). 

00:00:46.327 --> 00:00:48.986
 Do not use unpasteurized milk 

00:00:49.116 --> 00:00:54.718
 and avoid using milk after the expiry date stated on the packaging. 

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:58.423
 Open the steam plug door and place the milk container. 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.786
 Lift the handle up and insert a Nespresso capsule. 

00:01:08.374 --> 00:01:09.810
 Close the handle. 

00:01:11.011 --> 00:01:14.396
 Place a Cappuccino cup under the coffee spout. 

00:01:15.138 --> 00:01:20.013
 Always orient the milk spout toward the center of the cup or glass. 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.369
 Lift the adjustable drip tray if you want to use a tall glass for Latte Macchiato. 

00:01:27.415 --> 00:01:32.521
 You can adjust the texture of the milk foam by turning the milk foam controller to the right or left. 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.730
 Press the Cappuccino button. 

00:01:36.395 --> 00:01:41.233
 The cooking starts after a few seconds and stops automatically. 

00:01:58.528 --> 00:02:03.289
 It is important to remove used Nespresso capsules after each use 

00:02:03.355 --> 00:02:06.701
 and don't let them sit in the system. 

00:02:07.252 --> 00:02:12.280
 It is also important to rinse the system after each milk-based preparation. 

00:02:13.137 --> 00:02:15.757
 Place a container under the milk spout. 

00:02:18.181 --> 00:02:21.871
 Turn the milk regulator to the "CLEAN" function. 

00:02:22.423 --> 00:02:24.660
 The machine starts rinsing. 

00:02:27.123 --> 00:02:30.469
 It stops automatically after approx. 15 seconds. 

00:02:30.983 --> 00:02:36.507
 Turn the milk foam controller back to the milk position after rinsing. 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:41.817
 Remove the milk container from the machine and place it in the refrigerator. 

00:02:42.293 --> 00:02:44.645
 Then close the steam plug door. 

00:02:47.758 --> 00:02:51.524
 Every other day, the Rapid Cappuccino system is dismantled 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:55.345
 and all component parts are cleaned in a dishwasher. 

00:02:56.814 --> 00:02:59.013
 Remove the lid of the milk container. 

00:03:00.902 --> 00:03:02.948
 Remove the lid of the milk container 

00:03:03.042 --> 00:03:06.502
 by turning the knob to the “REMOVE” position and then lifting up. 

00:03:09.148 --> 00:03:12.035
 Remove the Rapid Cappuccino System connector 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.468
 by changing the setting from 'LOCKED' to 'OPEN' and dragging it off. 

00:03:17.746 --> 00:03:20.328
 Remove the milk spout by pulling it off. 

00:03:22.255 --> 00:03:24.837
 Remove the suction tube. 

00:03:31.006 --> 00:03:33.818
 In case there is no access to the dishwasher, 

00:03:34.063 --> 00:03:39.549
 Carefully rinse any residue of milk from all components with clean water. 

00:03:42.297 --> 00:03:48.815
 Soak all the components in warm water, approx. 40 ° C, 

00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:52.789
 added mild detergent for at least 30 minutes. 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.320
 Rinse thoroughly with clean water and wipe all the parts with a clean tea towel.
