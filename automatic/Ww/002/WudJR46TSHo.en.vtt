this<00:01:10.880> will<00:01:10.940> reinstall<00:01:11.659> windows<00:01:12.490> but<00:01:13.490> keep<00:01:13.760> my

the<00:01:27.600> whole<00:01:27.720> process<00:01:27.960> takes<00:01:28.440> just<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.740> few

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
the whole process takes just a few

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.560 
the whole process takes just a few
minutes<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.370> can<00:01:29.610> be<00:01:29.700> pretty<00:01:29.910> handy<00:01:30.180> when

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
minutes and can be pretty handy when

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.750 
minutes and can be pretty handy when
helping<00:01:30.840> others<00:01:31.080> with<00:01:31.260> their<00:01:31.320> PCs<00:01:31.800> especially

helping others with their PCs especially

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.220 
helping others with their PCs especially
since<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.060> doesn't<00:01:33.210> require<00:01:33.510> backing<00:01:33.960> up<00:01:34.050> all

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:34.230 
since it doesn't require backing up all

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.070 
since it doesn't require backing up all
the<00:01:34.530> data<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:35.250> another<00:01:35.430> drive<00:01:35.760> first<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.420> then

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
the data to another drive first and then

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.890 
the data to another drive first and then
putting<00:01:37.260> them<00:01:37.380> back<00:01:37.560> later<00:01:37.770> as<00:01:38.600> we<00:01:39.600> can<00:01:39.750> see

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
putting them back later as we can see

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.780 
putting them back later as we can see
here<00:01:40.140> all<00:01:40.260> my<00:01:40.830> metro-style<00:01:41.220> apps<00:01:41.490> are

here all my metro-style apps are
preserved

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.270 

and<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.450> can<00:01:51.570> also<00:01:51.720> see<00:01:52.050> that<00:01:52.290> my<00:01:52.800> data<00:01:53.040> are

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
and you can also see that my data are

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.910 
and you can also see that my data are
here<00:01:53.670> as<00:01:53.760> well

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
but if i refresh my PC I would have to

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.150 
but if i refresh my PC I would have to
