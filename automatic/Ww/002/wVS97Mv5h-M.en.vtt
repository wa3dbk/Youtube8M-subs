00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:13.340
 Books have been providing for centuries 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:16.350
 information source of humanity dar 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.660
 read the books and transform them 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.189
 with this work theoretical information 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.170
 in practically applicable knowledge 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:27.779
 Expand your imagination and 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.000
 learn a three-dimensional 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.649
 moving model of a human 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:41.570
 visualize how to orient oneself in 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.570
 Body of which kinds of joints are there 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:51.160
 how is the musculature what processes 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:57.040
 run off in a muscle and how to become 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:59.170
 This controls how I train my 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:03.160
 abdominal muscles if possible the gentle 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:06.490
 how does the spine move? 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.729
 spine how do the individual work 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.290
 twirl together 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.320
 why does a muscle work? 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.570
 stretched hip as outside rotator at 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:21.149
 building the hip did the opposite 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.149
 he performs an inside rotation 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.590
 which interaction exists between 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.070
 the movement apparatus of the breathing and the 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.070
 circulation 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.289
 what is meant by osteopaths and 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:44.350
 how can a herniated disc 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:47.140
 they experience the human 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.420
 body its possibilities of movement and 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.940
 thereby occurring problems in the 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.110
 movie series 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.110
 anatomical studies
