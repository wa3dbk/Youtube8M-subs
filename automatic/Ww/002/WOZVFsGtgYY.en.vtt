00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:08.610
 100 years ago , we put 20 every day 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.480
 kilometers back today it is straight 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.670
 once 800 meters what that tells us completely 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.650
 simply we do not need training 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.500
 some training but a training 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.289
 the simple one is for sure and that 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.750
 effectively a workout is in force 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.240
 endurance circle of milon the 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.849
 power endurance compass that's centerpiece 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.099
 of the training principle of milon 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.140
 effective basic training around the 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.149
 endurance to improve muscles 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.640
 to burn up burn fat and 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.680
 to live healthier 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.170
 keyword simply a chip card becomes too 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.570
 her key for a new workout 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.850
 experience everything starts with that 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.160
 the devices within seconds in the 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.289
 move the optimal position for you 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.629
 the level of stress also arises 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.030
 automatically on your training plan 1 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.320
 this is possible because millions of devices 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.660
 do not work with weight plates 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.340
 but with electronically generated 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.930
 resist quickly and easily 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.810
 can be changed steplessly 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.540
 In the milon circle, they train at six 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.270
 power and two endurance devices always 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.180
 same rhythm 60 seconds training 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.939
 then 30 seconds break and device change 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.340
 the stamina units are four 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:24.619
 minutes for a circular walk 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.240
 you only need 17 5 minutes 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.750
 a time pillar in the middle gives the 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.729
 before 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.900
 Do not wait for the password safely 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.540
 important movements are 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.070
 decisive for the training success 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.890
 Milon devices guide you on their way 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.720
 movements ergonomic and 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.640
 also individual to the millimeter 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.940
 restrictions such as injuries 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.740
 can be considered 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.650
 at the endurance devices you take over 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.869
 heart the direction you exceed yours 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.600
 optimal pulse range is reduced 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:02.700
 Automatically adjust the load 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.700
 or operating errors have no chance 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.200
 Keyword effectively the mix of power and 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.179
 endurance units combined with the 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.700
 change of intensive load and 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.040
 short break this period of time zierke 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.410
 principle of milon causes a special 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.959
 sustained activation of metabolism 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.400
 and burning fat 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.620
 thanks to intelligent software control 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.450
 can be used with the milon power tools 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.760
 realize training types 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.340
 optimally the potential of your muscles 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.750
 exhaust one weight actively 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.560
 the muscles have to move 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.319
 contract 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.300
 this concentric work is for the 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.220
 Muscle more difficult than a weight in 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.709
 to slow the countermovement again 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.680
 the eccentric phase in which the 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.930
 muscle again stretches this factor 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.790
 use the devices in Lyon and charge 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:53.100
 Muscles in the eccentric phase 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:56.079
 automatically with a higher resistance 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.769
 the training in milan endurance 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:01.090
 That's about 30 percent 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.510
 more effective than a conventional one 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.510
 training 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.560
 via computer smartphone or tablet 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.910
 you and your trainer have access to it 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.440
 your collected training data here 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.140
 you can watch your progress 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.870
 and the quality of your training 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.120
 Analyze up to everyone 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:27.220
 individual exercise and movement 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.220
 course, plan your further training 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:36.550
 training in the endurance circle 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.550
 creating the bodies
