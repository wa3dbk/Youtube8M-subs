just any 17-inch LCD monitor it's a
touchscreen<00:00:07.649> let's<00:00:08.370> throw<00:00:08.610> her<00:00:08.700> on<00:00:08.820> the

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
touchscreen let's throw her on the

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:17.550 
touchscreen let's throw her on the
tormach<00:00:09.210> mill<00:00:09.450> and<00:00:09.630> see<00:00:09.750> how<00:00:09.809> she<00:00:09.870> runs

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.560 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.390 

I<00:00:18.689> did<00:00:19.689> have<00:00:19.810> to<00:00:19.960> drill<00:00:20.230> four<00:00:20.830> new<00:00:20.980> holes<00:00:21.220> in

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:21.400 
I did have to drill four new holes in

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.580 
I did have to drill four new holes in
the<00:00:21.490> bracket<00:00:21.670> here<00:00:22.119> just<00:00:23.080> slightly<00:00:23.410> under

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:23.590 
the bracket here just slightly under

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.700 
the bracket here just slightly under
three-inch<00:00:24.430> pattern<00:00:24.939> they<00:00:25.300> gated<00:00:25.570> 2.95<00:00:26.349> and<00:00:26.680> I

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
three-inch pattern they gated 2.95 and I

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.319 
three-inch pattern they gated 2.95 and I
rolled<00:00:26.980> them<00:00:27.099> out<00:00:27.130> with<00:00:27.279> a<00:00:27.310> number<00:00:27.610> two<00:00:27.820> which

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:28.329 
rolled them out with a number two which

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:31.019 
rolled them out with a number two which
does<00:00:28.599> give<00:00:28.840> you<00:00:28.960> some<00:00:29.140> extra<00:00:29.410> room<00:00:29.880> just<00:00:30.880> so

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.029 
does give you some extra room just so

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:32.519 
does give you some extra room just so
you<00:00:31.449> don't<00:00:31.509> have<00:00:31.779> to<00:00:31.900> worry<00:00:32.079> about<00:00:32.140> what<00:00:32.439> the

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
you don't have to worry about what the

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:40.290 
you don't have to worry about what the
exact<00:00:32.980> measurement<00:00:33.640> is<00:00:37.920> I'm<00:00:38.920> gonna<00:00:39.100> reuse<00:00:39.790> the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
exact measurement is I'm gonna reuse the

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.319 
exact measurement is I'm gonna reuse the
same<00:00:41.010> existing<00:00:42.010> VGA<00:00:42.370> cable<00:00:42.790> which<00:00:42.910> I<00:00:43.030> assume

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
same existing VGA cable which I assume

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:44.759 
same existing VGA cable which I assume
is<00:00:43.510> no<00:00:44.140> different

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:44.769 
is no different

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:48.390 
is no different
what<00:00:44.949> is<00:00:45.070> different<00:00:45.489> is<00:00:45.640> the<00:00:47.100> U<00:00:48.100> at<00:00:48.250> the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:48.400 
what is different is the U at the

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.180 
what is different is the U at the
touchscreen<00:00:48.909> monitor<00:00:49.510> has<00:00:49.690> a<00:00:49.720> USB<00:00:50.190> cable

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
touchscreen monitor has a USB cable

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.770 
touchscreen monitor has a USB cable
which<00:00:51.430> I'm<00:00:51.549> assuming<00:00:51.670> is<00:00:52.000> what<00:00:52.150> interfaces

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
which I'm assuming is what interfaces

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.490 
which I'm assuming is what interfaces
with<00:00:52.960> the<00:00:53.430> software<00:00:54.430> and<00:00:54.580> then<00:00:54.820> it

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
with the software and then it

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.990 
with the software and then it
communication<00:00:56.500> with<00:00:56.589> the<00:00:56.799> pilot<00:00:57.159> or<00:00:57.850> the

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
communication with the pilot or the

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.570 
communication with the pilot or the
computer<00:00:58.689> then<00:00:59.140> it<00:00:59.260> has<00:00:59.350> a<00:00:59.379> power<00:00:59.710> brick<00:01:00.280> or

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.580 
computer then it has a power brick or

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:06.929 
computer then it has a power brick or
wart<00:01:01.210> which<00:01:01.449> you<00:01:01.570> got<00:01:01.720> to<00:01:01.839> plug<00:01:02.019> in<00:01:02.140> as<00:01:02.260> well<00:01:05.939> so

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:06.939 
wart which you got to plug in as well so

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:08.999 
wart which you got to plug in as well so
those<00:01:07.150> three<00:01:07.570> things<00:01:07.900> and<00:01:08.409> we<00:01:08.500> should<00:01:08.680> be<00:01:08.830> good

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009 
those three things and we should be good

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:11.130 
those three things and we should be good
all<00:01:09.880> right<00:01:09.970> now<00:01:10.119> we<00:01:10.180> have<00:01:10.330> to<00:01:10.420> calibrate<00:01:10.659> this

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
all right now we have to calibrate this

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.840 
all right now we have to calibrate this
this<00:01:11.380> is<00:01:11.500> a<00:01:11.530> very<00:01:11.890> difficult<00:01:12.189> and<00:01:12.610> tedious

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
a win so I threw it on the lathe because

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.240 
a win so I threw it on the lathe because
we<00:02:25.689> actually<00:02:25.810> have<00:02:26.049> a<00:02:26.080> lathe<00:02:26.290> job<00:02:26.530> today<00:02:26.830> and

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
we actually have a lathe job today and

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.530 
we actually have a lathe job today and
that's<00:02:27.340> why<00:02:27.519> I<00:02:27.549> want<00:02:27.730> to<00:02:27.790> use<00:02:27.909> it<00:02:28.030> on<00:02:28.090> I<00:02:28.269> bought

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
that's why I want to use it on I bought

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.950 
that's why I want to use it on I bought
a<00:02:28.599> second<00:02:28.989> one<00:02:29.019> for<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:29.650> mill<00:02:29.860> the

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
a second one for the mill the

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.710 
a second one for the mill the
is<00:02:31.050> awesome<00:02:31.650> here's<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.920> thing<00:02:32.070> folks<00:02:32.250> it's

$220<00:02:33.720> I<00:02:33.900> think<00:02:34.380> their<00:02:34.590> standard<00:02:35.310> monitor<00:02:35.790> is

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
$220 I think their standard monitor is

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.360 
$220 I think their standard monitor is
uh<00:02:36.320> 180<00:02:37.320> ensure<00:02:37.740> you<00:02:37.920> can<00:02:38.070> buy<00:02:38.160> your<00:02:38.340> own

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
uh 180 ensure you can buy your own

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.310 
uh 180 ensure you can buy your own
monitor<00:02:38.790> if<00:02:38.910> you<00:02:39.000> want<00:02:39.240> to<00:02:39.390> for<00:02:39.630> cheaper<00:02:39.960> but

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
monitor if you want to for cheaper but

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.740 
monitor if you want to for cheaper but
for<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.560> touchscreen<00:02:41.150> -<00:02:42.150> or<00:02:42.240> twenty<00:02:42.510> dollars

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
for the touchscreen - or twenty dollars

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.330 
for the touchscreen - or twenty dollars
it's<00:02:42.870> like<00:02:42.960> a<00:02:42.990> no-brainer<00:02:43.260> when<00:02:43.770> it<00:02:43.980> comes<00:02:44.160> to

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
it's like a no-brainer when it comes to

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.430 
it's like a no-brainer when it comes to
how<00:02:44.700> we<00:02:44.730> use<00:02:45.000> this<00:02:45.120> in<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:45.360> shop<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:45.870> this<00:02:46.380> is

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
how we use this in the shop and this is

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.500 
how we use this in the shop and this is
what<00:02:46.800> I<00:02:46.830> love<00:02:47.070> about<00:02:47.340> it<00:02:47.670> and<00:02:47.760> what<00:02:47.970> tormach<00:02:48.360> is

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
what I love about it and what tormach is

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.660 
what I love about it and what tormach is
doing<00:02:48.840> with<00:02:49.350> path<00:02:49.740> pilot<00:02:50.220> in<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.370> sort<00:02:50.550> of<00:02:50.580> the

doing with path pilot in the sort of the

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.580 
doing with path pilot in the sort of the
direction<00:02:50.820> of<00:02:51.210> the<00:02:51.270> company<00:02:51.630> is<00:02:51.840> they're

thing<00:02:58.500> I<00:02:58.590> think<00:02:58.800> was<00:02:58.920> part<00:02:59.160> of<00:02:59.250> path<00:02:59.430> pilot

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
thing I think was part of path pilot

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.390 
thing I think was part of path pilot
calibration<00:03:00.780> which<00:03:01.230> is<00:03:01.380> awesome<00:03:01.950> I<00:03:02.130> actually

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
calibration which is awesome I actually

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.010 
calibration which is awesome I actually
had<00:03:02.610> a<00:03:02.640> little<00:03:02.880> hiccup<00:03:03.030> with<00:03:03.270> my<00:03:03.420> my<00:03:03.720> email

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
had a little hiccup with my my email

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.570 
had a little hiccup with my my email
tormach<00:03:04.380> they<00:03:04.530> were<00:03:04.590> all<00:03:04.830> over<00:03:05.040> it<00:03:05.190> right<00:03:05.430> away

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
tormach they were all over it right away

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.730 
tormach they were all over it right away
that's<00:03:06.300> cool<00:03:06.660> I<00:03:06.840> like<00:03:06.870> that<00:03:07.080> they<00:03:07.320> own<00:03:07.530> it<00:03:07.710> and

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
that's cool I like that they own it and

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.380 
that's cool I like that they own it and
here's<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.370> thing<00:03:08.550> and<00:03:08.640> it's<00:03:08.760> it's<00:03:08.940> a<00:03:09.060> subtle

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
here's the thing and it's it's a subtle

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.440 
here's the thing and it's it's a subtle
point<00:03:09.780> -<00:03:10.670> hobbyist<00:03:11.670> but<00:03:11.910> it's<00:03:12.030> not<00:03:12.180> a<00:03:12.210> subtle

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
point - hobbyist but it's not a subtle

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.620 
point - hobbyist but it's not a subtle
point<00:03:12.690> -<00:03:12.930> machine<00:03:13.710> shops<00:03:14.010> which<00:03:14.250> is<00:03:14.630> having

point - machine shops which is having

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.740 
point - machine shops which is having
the<00:03:15.990> whole<00:03:16.950> package<00:03:17.550> be<00:03:17.760> an<00:03:18.030> integrated

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
machine and not have it be this

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.970 
machine and not have it be this
hodgepodge<00:03:20.820> of<00:03:21.300> well<00:03:22.110> here's<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.590> machine

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
hodgepodge of well here's the machine

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.590 
hodgepodge of well here's the machine
here's<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.460> controller<00:03:24.000> here's<00:03:24.450> the

here's the controller here's the

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.440 
here's the controller here's the

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
hardware it's all over the place and I

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.240 
hardware it's all over the place and I
actually<00:03:27.630> would<00:03:27.960> like<00:03:28.050> to<00:03:28.110> see<00:03:28.260> torment<00:03:28.920> push

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
actually would like to see torment push

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.300 
actually would like to see torment push
more<00:03:29.550> to<00:03:29.700> a<00:03:29.730> fully<00:03:30.000> integrated<00:03:31.310> appliance

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
more to a fully integrated appliance

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.940 
more to a fully integrated appliance
instead<00:03:32.730> of<00:03:32.820> even<00:03:33.210> having<00:03:33.510> like<00:03:33.630> this<00:03:33.720> this<00:03:34.380> PC

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
instead of even having like this this PC

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.980 
instead of even having like this this PC
computer<00:03:35.520> which<00:03:35.670> I<00:03:36.000> think<00:03:36.360> path<00:03:36.540> pilot<00:03:36.870> was<00:03:36.960> a

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
computer which I think path pilot was a

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.240 
computer which I think path pilot was a
start<00:03:37.260> there<00:03:37.440> and<00:03:37.590> I<00:03:37.710> don't<00:03:37.920> know<00:03:38.070> if<00:03:38.160> I'll

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
start there and I don't know if I'll

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.530 
start there and I don't know if I'll
ever<00:03:38.340> get<00:03:38.490> them<00:03:38.640> there<00:03:38.790> or<00:03:38.880> not<00:03:39.030> but<00:03:39.240> just<00:03:39.270> like

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
ever get them there or not but just like

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.940 
ever get them there or not but just like
you<00:03:39.690> see<00:03:39.900> at<00:03:40.020> a<00:03:40.110> vertical<00:03:40.320> machine<00:03:40.710> Center

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
you see at a vertical machine Center

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.400 
you see at a vertical machine Center
where<00:03:41.070> you've<00:03:41.160> actually<00:03:41.310> got<00:03:41.580> a<00:03:41.610> proper

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
where you've actually got a proper

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.470 
where you've actually got a proper
cabinet<00:03:43.410> with<00:03:43.740> a<00:03:43.770> built-in<00:03:44.280> keyboard<00:03:44.610> and<00:03:45.060> the

cabinet with a built-in keyboard and the

built-in jog wheel and and in physical
button<00:03:48.210> the<00:03:48.330> touch<00:03:48.450> screen<00:03:48.690> is<00:03:48.810> great<00:03:48.930> don't

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
button the touch screen is great don't

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.420 
button the touch screen is great don't
get<00:03:49.410> me<00:03:49.500> wrong<00:03:49.530> but<00:03:49.770> I<00:03:49.830> would<00:03:50.010> love<00:03:50.130> some<00:03:50.400> of

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
get me wrong but I would love some of

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.980 
get me wrong but I would love some of
these<00:03:50.550> things<00:03:50.760> to<00:03:51.030> either<00:03:51.210> have<00:03:51.450> or<00:03:51.480> support

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 
these things to either have or support

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.320 
these things to either have or support
physical<00:03:52.680> buttons<00:03:53.130> I<00:03:53.280> think<00:03:53.850> we'll<00:03:53.970> get<00:03:54.120> there

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
physical buttons I think we'll get there
