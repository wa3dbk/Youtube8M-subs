00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
by a stop what it thought was the proper

by a stop what it thought was the proper
exposure<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:04.710> resulted<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.309> very<00:01:05.610> good

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
exposure this resulted in very good

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.510 
exposure this resulted in very good
shadow<00:01:06.270> detail<00:01:06.570> without<00:01:07.320> blowing<00:01:07.799> out<00:01:08.070> all<00:01:08.340> my

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
highlights in this example I had an open

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.160 
highlights in this example I had an open
window<00:01:11.400> right<00:01:11.790> behind<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.210> curtain<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.750> wanted

window right behind a curtain I wanted

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.100 
window right behind a curtain I wanted
to<00:01:13.229> capture<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.650> detail<00:01:13.950> in<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.280> curtain

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
to capture the detail in the curtain

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.270 
to capture the detail in the curtain
since<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.200> camera<00:01:16.500> saw<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.740> light<00:01:16.979> coming

more<00:01:19.320> light<00:01:19.710> than<00:01:20.040> was<00:01:20.400> actually<00:01:20.759> on<00:01:20.850> my

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
more light than was actually on my

more light than was actually on my

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
subject to compensate for this I

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.460 
subject to compensate for this I
adjusted<00:01:24.240> my<00:01:24.299> exposure<00:01:24.659> count<00:01:24.960> two<00:01:25.110> plus<00:01:25.350> one

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
adjusted my exposure count two plus one
