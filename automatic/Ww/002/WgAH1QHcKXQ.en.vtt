 welcome for this tip and tips 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:27.340
 today episode discovery of a 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:28.119
 truck what do I say of a monster a huge 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.940
 truck 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.710
 as you see here truck from 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.430
 shipyard that is really very very 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.830
 impressive 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.559
 it is huge then as we 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.120
 just found we go on 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.780
 our little card as usual you 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.210
 show the location of this truck and we 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.149
 look at our little town that is 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.040
 here and there we discover directly 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:52.780
 the location of our truck is 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.460
 this little career here where you 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.910
 will see where there is work 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.160
 you point your cursor here at this 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.320
 level there and you will find 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.730
 directly a truck gain a little 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.690
 everywhere you just have to do the 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:10.210
 turn every 2 to 2 to the site there 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.800
 so I have a link here but I 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.560
 have crossed a while ago I believe 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.180
 that there is a higher all that finally 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:22.630
 there is really everywhere then for 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:25.150
 mount on it very wrong at t1 and that's it 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.070
 so look it's really a monster 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.570
 a monster so what is funny 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.080
 is that fighting is the road 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.250
 the cops follow us cops 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.259
 do not like being on the road 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.560
 with this truck 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.560
 the blizzard 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.430
 so here's aulas I escaped a beautiful 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.080
 accident with the train once I see 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.880
 if I can take the train directly 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.970
 so you see we're going to go on 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.970
 the highway and there normally the pile 10 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:05.870
 is going to annoy us so here you see a 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:10.490
 dark gpo on cars and trucks 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.490
 no problem it does not bother him 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.739
 So here we are, I hope that this little 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.360
 tips and tricks you will have liked I you 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.260
 say to the next bye bye 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.260
