pretty down easily and to be honest even

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.889 
pretty down easily and to be honest even
though<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.640> devil<00:00:53.910> or<00:00:53.969> camp<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.600> game<00:00:54.780> was

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899

like<00:00:55.050> surprisingly<00:00:55.590> easy<00:00:55.829> i<00:00:55.980> look<00:00:56.160> at<00:00:56.250> i

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340

stroll<00:00:57.180> around<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.449> keeper<00:00:57.719> pretty<00:00:57.899> much<00:00:58.079> and

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
stroll around the keeper pretty much and

stroll around the keeper pretty much and
I<00:00:58.920> just<00:00:58.949> thought<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.489> was<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.640> bit<00:00:59.760> too<00:01:00.000> easy

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
I just thought it was a bit too easy

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.150 
I just thought it was a bit too easy
considering<00:01:00.570> he<00:01:00.960> did<00:01:01.140> have<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.320> full<00:01:01.590> girl<00:01:01.890> team

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
considering he did have a full girl team

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.070 
considering he did have a full girl team
I<00:01:02.340> know<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.550> was<00:01:02.640> looking<00:01:03.000> but<00:01:03.210> as<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.329> said<00:01:03.510> was

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
I know it was looking but as I said was

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.080 
I know it was looking but as I said was
a<00:01:04.110> full<00:01:04.439> girl<00:01:04.680> team<00:01:05.040> eventually<00:01:05.640> does<00:01:05.909> get<00:01:06.060> a

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
a full girl team eventually does get a

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.270 
a full girl team eventually does get a
go<00:01:06.270> back<00:01:06.479> just<00:01:06.720> after<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:07.140> had<00:01:07.439> this<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.830> will<00:01:08.130> not

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
think is just again where I guess one

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.830 
think is just again where I guess one
back<00:02:46.440> here<00:02:46.770> he<00:02:47.370> gets<00:02:47.580> one<00:02:47.760> back<00:02:47.940> its<00:02:48.150> lair<00:02:48.360> and

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
back here he gets one back its lair and

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.290 
back here he gets one back its lair and
yeah<00:02:49.230> poor<00:02:50.130> defense<00:02:50.430> for<00:02:50.670> me<00:02:50.760> and<00:02:50.970> it<00:02:51.120> pretty

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
yeah poor defense for me and it pretty

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.699 
yeah poor defense for me and it pretty
much<00:02:51.390> is<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.630> defensive<00:02:52.080> lapse<00:02:52.260> of<00:02:52.410> felt<00:02:52.590> too

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709
