00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
could spray right over 80 grit I've

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.270 
could spray right over 80 grit I've
heard<00:03:44.450> of<00:03:44.569> people<00:03:44.690> spring<00:03:45.230> right<00:03:45.590> over<00:03:45.860> 60

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
heard of people spring right over 60

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.640 
heard of people spring right over 60
grit<00:03:46.489> but<00:03:46.700> I<00:03:46.730> just<00:03:46.940> think<00:03:47.060> that's<00:03:47.239> too<00:03:47.510> coarse

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
grit but I just think that's too coarse

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.710 
grit but I just think that's too coarse
so<00:03:48.739> what<00:03:49.129> I<00:03:49.159> did<00:03:49.310> was<00:03:49.670> I<00:03:49.819> had<00:03:50.000> eighty<00:03:50.269> grit<00:03:50.599> in

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
so what I did was I had eighty grit in

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.809 
so what I did was I had eighty grit in
some<00:03:50.930> areas<00:03:51.349> but<00:03:51.379> I<00:03:51.650> actually<00:03:52.010> feathered<00:03:52.670> them

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
some areas but I actually feathered them

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.929 
some areas but I actually feathered them
down<00:03:53.030> with<00:03:53.299> a<00:03:53.329> little<00:03:53.569> 240<00:03:54.489> and<00:03:55.489> this<00:03:55.640> is<00:03:55.790> where

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:55.939 
down with a little 240 and this is where

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:57.850 
down with a little 240 and this is where

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
little two-tone I'm not sure I mean the

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.010 
little two-tone I'm not sure I mean the
original<00:04:58.639> idea<00:04:59.000> was<00:04:59.180> to<00:04:59.330> paint<00:04:59.539> the<00:04:59.660> mirrors

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
original idea was to paint the mirrors

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.439 
original idea was to paint the mirrors
gold<00:05:00.320> are<00:05:00.919> the<00:05:00.979> same<00:05:01.400> as<00:05:01.610> a<00:05:01.639> stripe<00:05:02.120> because

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:02.449 
gold are the same as a stripe because

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:03.879 
gold are the same as a stripe because
we're<00:05:02.539> gonna<00:05:02.660> have<00:05:02.810> a<00:05:02.840> graphic<00:05:03.349> stripe<00:05:03.620> on<00:05:03.800> the

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:03.889 
we're gonna have a graphic stripe on the

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:07.540 
we're gonna have a graphic stripe on the
bottom<00:05:04.190> ah<00:05:04.810> but<00:05:05.810> I<00:05:05.900> was<00:05:05.930> thinking<00:05:06.199> maybe<00:05:07.159> what

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
bottom ah but I was thinking maybe what

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.879 
bottom ah but I was thinking maybe what
if<00:05:07.639> I<00:05:07.760> made<00:05:08.000> the<00:05:08.150> eyelids<00:05:08.659> gold<00:05:09.349> you<00:05:09.680> think

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:09.889 
if I made the eyelids gold you think

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:13.120 
if I made the eyelids gold you think
that<00:05:10.010> would<00:05:10.130> look<00:05:10.159> stupid<00:05:10.669> you<00:05:11.199> know<00:05:12.199> I<00:05:12.470> was

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
that would look stupid you know I was

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.529 
that would look stupid you know I was
thinking<00:05:13.370> of<00:05:13.460> just<00:05:13.550> making<00:05:13.970> those<00:05:14.120> those

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:14.539 
thinking of just making those those

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:21.969 
thinking of just making those those
headlamp<00:05:15.349> covers<00:05:15.740> gold<00:05:16.039> ah<00:05:19.449> maybe<00:05:20.889> cuz<00:05:21.889> I

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
headlamp covers gold ah maybe cuz I

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:24.100 
headlamp covers gold ah maybe cuz I
think<00:05:22.039> if<00:05:22.340> I<00:05:22.460> just<00:05:22.490> a<00:05:22.789> mirrors<00:05:23.210> and<00:05:23.479> the

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
think if I just a mirrors and the

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.719 
think if I just a mirrors and the
headlamps<00:05:24.590> gold<00:05:24.800> it<00:05:24.919> would<00:05:24.979> look<00:05:25.130> funny<00:05:25.310> but<00:05:25.490> I

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:25.729 
headlamps gold it would look funny but I

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:27.790 
headlamps gold it would look funny but I
probably<00:05:26.090> I<00:05:26.449> may<00:05:26.750> not<00:05:26.900> do<00:05:27.080> it<00:05:27.199> I<00:05:27.349> made<00:05:27.530> you<00:05:27.620> see
