00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.609

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.649
 I have to give honestly than you can 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.540
 you first did not really understand where I had to go 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.090

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.040
 because day whose the fuck is oil but yes 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.800
 public ugly 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:51.870
 yes i get him morris that boy and 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:53.520
 applause for you you used to be 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.750
 once bullied and if so what were you 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.640
 experiences 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.800
 I my self had never bullied my 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.300
 feeling along in was natural indeed 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.039
 agree that i was teased by my 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.140
 friends or maybe even by 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.990
 what superstructure as you were in the first year 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.729
 but not really that I thought of as I 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.590
 get bullied I sin driving I think 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.540
 I don't feel like it anymore 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.490
 no I never achieved that and I know 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.380
 not even know if I'm bullied and let 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.030
 it was bullied but it just wasn't the case 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.770
 never long maintained for another x to 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.689
 saying was just scourging people 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.450
 and that was it and I can't really do it 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.740
 share my experiences no and I can do it 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.110
 also difficult to help someone 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.150
 How can I do that I find it teased 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.799
 yes i have never seen anyone myself 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.220
 it is being bullied because such must 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.860
 say 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.840
 so it is strange to me when I 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.150
 sometimes reads something from someone 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.799
 had bullied think of why i can do that 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.990
 person can't help why can't I 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.479
 be with that person because it is normal 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.310
 no i don't get it i never have best 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.470
 actually understood and i am glad i did 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.119
 it never experienced what i never did with it 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.579
 and what I do the same 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.350
 never been on but it is just 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.229
 something really bad in it is something 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.369
 what is the best serious nowadays and me 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.500
 I also think that there is more attention 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.270
 must be on yes but i have 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.180
 so no experiences with it unfortunately I can 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.550
 also not really help people then and yes 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.020
 that's my answer maybe some of 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.240
 used on your question makes day 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.950
 bullying seriously subject between seriously 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.580
 answer 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.880
 a circle has 0 angles 0 times 0 is 0 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.280
 0 looks like an eye eye does not last long 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.530
 to say and guess who also not long 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.870
 is Wesley Sneijder and you know what else 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.880
 more not long is a fine and natural 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.210
 an elephant is tall and one 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.180
 elephant lift sometime want full ship 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.670
 for an elephant's loop has a solar 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.570
 and illuminati has an eye 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.570
 illuminati suitcase 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.510
 these reactions are really so bad really 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.480
 I thought again for this 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.760
 because yes people 15 thumbs up and then 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.860
 I can read a difficult over where 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.600
 is your favorite food I really have one 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.950
 thing I really love is that 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.440
 will find a few beside for example 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.510
 also kale tasty or carrots or cut 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.550
 just or steak but when i eat 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.130
 had to choose will look at it 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.800
 really happy with it or in terms of food 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.480
 yes what is a room without windows 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.730
 a room without windows is actually 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.990
 just one the windowless room or one 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.970
 room without windows 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.650
 or a room with no window or 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.420
 a room that went into windows 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.310
 is a room where none 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.380
 light and come or light pink room 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.300
 either a room without light or one 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.610
 windowless light pink room or one 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.470
 room without windows 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.720
 so without light I just don't know 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.640
 if you can be a well-known athlete 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.990

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.880

 if you can be a well-known athlete 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.880
 what would that be 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:53.159
 and 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.900

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.460
