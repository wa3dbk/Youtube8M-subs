whole robot under there Autobot symbol
that's<00:01:12.390> what<00:01:12.600> activates<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.350> activators

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
that's what activates the activators

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.910 
that's what activates the activators
activation<00:01:17.060> yeah<00:01:18.090> but<00:01:19.700> six<00:01:20.700> wheels<00:01:20.939> are<00:01:21.150> roll

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
activation yeah but six wheels are roll

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.770 
activation yeah but six wheels are roll
those<00:01:22.920> around<00:01:23.250> very<00:01:23.520> well<00:01:26.299> basically<00:01:27.299> the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
those around very well basically the

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.240 
those around very well basically the
main<00:01:27.960> gimmick<00:01:28.290> here<00:01:28.619> since<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.070> an

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
main gimmick here since it is an

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.560 
main gimmick here since it is an
activator<00:01:30.140> is<00:01:31.909> you<00:01:32.909> push<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.240> button<00:01:33.450> on<00:01:33.509> top

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
activator is you push the button on top

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.080 
activator is you push the button on top
here<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.979> best<00:01:35.130> way<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.340> found<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.610> do<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:35.970> if

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
here the best way I found to do it is if

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.249 
here the best way I found to do it is if
you're<00:01:36.210> basically<00:01:36.509> just<00:01:36.570> kind<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:36.930> hold<00:01:37.079> them

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
you're basically just kind of hold them

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.410 
you're basically just kind of hold them
like<00:01:37.590> this<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:38.070> push<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.939> bun<00:01:39.090> right<00:01:39.210> here

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
like this and push the bun right here

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.840 
like this and push the bun right here
push<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.170> bun<00:01:40.290> in<00:01:41.090> he<00:01:42.090> activates<00:01:43.009> and<00:01:44.009> they're

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
push the bun in he activates and they're

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.280 
push the bun in he activates and they're
done<00:01:45.060> there<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.479> goes<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.840> does<00:01:45.960> most<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.200> the

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
done there it goes it does most of the

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.840 
done there it goes it does most of the
transformation<00:01:46.470> for<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.520> sawed<00:01:47.729> off<00:01:47.759> the

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
transformation for you you sawed off the
