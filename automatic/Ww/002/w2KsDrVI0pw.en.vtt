00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.050
 hello everyone how are you today I bring you 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.360
 a video for the questions section 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.250
 frequent something you ask me 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.900
 I'm usually inside of me 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.700
 hydrate macro count 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.470
 carbon I keep in mind those 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.570
 hydrates that come from vegetables and 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.980
 of the vegetables you also ask me 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.390
 for the theme of fruits and good 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.430
 tell you that in the case of vegetables and 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.310
 Vegetables I did not count them is 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.320
 say I do not put in the count 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.619
 those hydrates that come from 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.190
 vegetables and vegetables 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:39.309
 the reason is very simple it is simply 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:42.190
 because vegetables are tall 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.019
 in fiber therefore have this low content 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.019
 of starch have almost no impact on 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:49.510
 insulin and its carbohydrates 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:52.300
 since they are mostly fibrous 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.659
 So, well, that's why I do not have them 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.010
 in mind and nothing to say is that I put 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:58.719
 free amount that is here that 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.610
 practically all my meals are 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:04.449
 seasoned with some type of vegetable 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:06.130
 be all breakfast and re dinner that good 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:10.149
 it's just in these I do not put in because 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.649
 I do not usually stick with vegetables 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:14.140
 kind of food that I put in those two 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:15.670
 meals but let's in the rest yes 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.110
 I usually put enough amount of 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.810
 vegetable 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.730
 mainly because they are very social and 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.000
 have numerous benefits for the 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.710
 health of course and nothing else in the case 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.360
 of the fruits yes I have it in mind 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.500
 So, well, hydrates 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.479
 carbon that I do have in mind to the 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.780
 time to do my my macro count 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:40.090
 they are the ones that come from rice pasta 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.380
 integral integral bread good I say 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.940
 integral because it is what I consume 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.030
 but come on if not for this standard what pan 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.260
 normal 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.470
 kim or sweet potato oatmeal 30 for each sweet potato 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:56.250
 Well, all that kind of thing and that 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:58.409
 counted and legumes of course and 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.450
 nothing more than this has been all that 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.460
 I hope I have finally clarified the 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.649
 said is the doubt that always arise 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.720
 numerous videos and well then that 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.580
 tell you who do not take them into account or 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.200
 now that I am in volume nor when 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.660
 I'm in maintenance or definition 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.880
 that is, I always put in free amount 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.010
 so nothing see you in the next 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.010
 chao video and peck
