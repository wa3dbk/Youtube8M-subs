00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:37.690
 Meeting who tried to go to the Earl's ground in the yard as previously in high ball situations 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:38.620
 I do not know whether to put the sp directly on the other's court, 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.699
 Woden 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:46.570
 It may create a cold air usually bear this humiliation 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:49.900

 Angara, yet did not have to sneak back a good volley deep into the matter - min 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:17.350
 In the modern tennis that tells the owner not to be able to directly characterize 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:20.950
 Rabbits require a lot of female players are now relatively well when used in Bali 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:25.509
 Some agile approval rather than male athletes can be late ah these things 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.700
 You have to say life management because you can hit it like this . 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:33.690
 You and everyone 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.690
 In other words , it is very pavilion in doubles game including players 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:44.530
 When it can not so easily be turned off as soon as this happens or what 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:46.869
 Conversely, you'll wake up to this story as if chideut swing party 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.799
