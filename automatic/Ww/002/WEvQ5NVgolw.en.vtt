00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.020
 Use only special dog discs and remove them

 use the discs possibly resulting sharp edges with 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.270
 sandpaper 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.990
 Make sure that you only play on a soft ground 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.390
 Themes and free of holes 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.650
 Also make sure that there are no dangerous objects on the ground 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.460
 lie or are in the way 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.510
 Gul leaps of the dog should be avoided until the age of 18 months 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.590
 is young and old enough to run the sport with jumps 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.950
 Care should be taken that the dog lands gently 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.310
 at an optimal landing for with a distribution of energy to the 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.360
 whole movement Scatter instead 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.180
 this is the case if the dog is first in front and then immediately afterwards 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.600
 the hind legs arises 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.600
 or with all four paws at the same time Landert 

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:21.730
 that a learner should always be done without the dog 

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:28.839
 They should always warm their dog thoroughly before going on the sport 

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:29.899
 float 

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:33.159
 the main reason why the warm-up training is not waived 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.819
 should be that the risk of injury is significantly lower if the 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.819
 Musculature is warm 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:47.519
 If you've never met her dog before, who played after Hunt 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.439
 First of all, get acquainted with the Porsche AG and learn that 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:54.119
 he must never bite new game culture 

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:57.439
 Here she was missing the prescribe hoax of the covenant with wriggling 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:59.419
 Movements so completed 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:02.859
 that she also has a chance to catch her up with her dog 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:06.089
 Exuberant when he shows interest and was in the disc is 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:11.669
 Do not forget to throw it for the dog 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:14.669

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:19.559
 at 0 1 one point behind Switzerland we run the host 

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:22.699
 bring back the disc even in the air without the difficulty 

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:23.780
 to catch 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.870
 catching the disc from the air is very difficult for many dogs at first 

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:33.129
 Let the dog have the simplest rollout of the episode first 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.129
 before in the fall on the disc from the air beginning 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:40.430
 the every throw should be thrown the rose in the line of sight prison 

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:44.389
 so that the dog can run after the disc without first turning around 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:47.389
 have to 

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:55.479
 Leusder and still Roland afterwards, you can now do the brilliant

 to catch the flying disc from the air Â» 

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:01.879
 For this we can later on the fleet 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:05.539
 Initially, however, I should first be suggested to be hit by the disc 

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:09.669
 move the disc forward in your hand and animate the dog in 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:11.719
 to bite the disc 

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:15.190
 only when the desire to move the locations can take in hand 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.359
 it is time 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.430
 to throw in a thump 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.960
 as they helped the disc lay next to the approximately ten forces upwards 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.960
 but they are not directly on the 8th 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.740
 only when the dog has learned to catch the fastest should they 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.409
 Cube lengthened in small steps 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:35.839
 Always throw the disc so far that the dog can easily catch it 

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:39.169
 can and has a sense of achievement 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.419
 Often it fails at proper timing if the dog does not use the disc 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:46.210
 can drive throw the disc only if the dog is also attentive 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.530
 For example, if you cancel and cancel the design, you may have a trigger view
