00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.340
 channel and gaming varieties 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.310
 in the background gameplay you watch 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.869

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.060

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.490
 that you come across in a cream and here 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.300

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.680
 swear 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.849
 without them even knowing you or 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.860
 stood that they ever heard of you 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.510
 have or without his cause 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.980
 for that and then you walk 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.810
 completely ruined 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.970
 that you are bad I you are tired that you 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.920

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.719

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.390

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:48.340
 a kem strike against très stokes and the 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.989
 whole enemy party I know 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.609
 and a couple that date so out 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.440
 Schelden and yes I did like it 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:55.660
 to have this a couple 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.769
 pots played against them and then 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.109
 all all won 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.519
 this stuff the my cold and i thought about the 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:02.230
 enemy standing i don't want to be that 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:03.609
 to walk towards the b fluid 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.379
 so i thought i would just try and 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:06.820
 kem strike language expert with the ak determine 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.530
 with shrinkage and the science there on the beautiful 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.790
 old and camel of course, or the 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.380
 autumn camel 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.720
 and is really just a nice cam to 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.610
 to look at and i like to 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.260
 a core stroke or a good score or too 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.240
 winning from people who are completely on leave 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.020
 try to scold and start to 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.280
 swear 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.570
 without even knowing you the bowl 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.640
 you in a game i think everyone that 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.960
 have ever had it you don't come game and 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.270
 how to realize your pc 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.890
 Frankia you with folk that are bad and come 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.570
 you against them and then they are just real 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.490
 double negative to have them one 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.960
 final score of 15 or 30 years runs the 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.730
 buyer you know he sees Schiphol healed 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.140
 at me walking around with his sniper 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.150
 he is just almost nothing 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.380
 I really kill him a lot and yes it 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.060
 is just funny to resist that kind 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.860
 I think people play themselves and it 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.180
 totally funny to strike the Kem 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.160
 its fetch it is a blog by death 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.410
 of course not the most chilliest mattis 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.850
 6 to 6 stupid no they still like me if you 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.960
 just a little try the and the 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.640
 least substantial if just a little 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.050
 tries to move to the side of the folder 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.460
 then you can just be one 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.650
 get nice score because I always 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.210
 Try also winehouse is just about 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.620
 to run the cycle of the directory so what i do 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.020
 now little do I do not walk 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.970
 all the way to the side and then through 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.379
 walk to the brook flag hoping that 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.610
 no one gets in your back and in the 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:11.860
 hope so in the back of you all 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.450
 emmy's can come and so can you be good 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.830
 score still gets what keeps it is not the 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.360
 meaning you really just go around 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.470
 run through the entire mat p but that 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.030
 is not going to work you just need one 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.890
 fixed route where you just have the 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.090
 could walk around all the time so I ran 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.290
 just the once the vegetables 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.069
 on this side of the map to the bear 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.269
 flew to this one 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.859
 man's hand to the commanding one 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.810
 side of the mouth to the bv and the whole 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:30.489
 time through and through until I get the 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.530
 Games are naturally had now 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:35.290
 that I am a bit more reserved 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.989
 because I knew they knew where 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.670
 I sat and if you know their know 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.109
 where you are 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.909
 So that one week you know that you order one 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:45.459
 certain place is then you no longer 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:47.139
 get away from that place because it is possible 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.310
 it is a game you like someone kilt 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:51.639
 and it doesn't matter who you kneel 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.439
 they always try again and again 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:55.629
 Get a payback on you if you are against it 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:58.239
 trash interpreters so people play you 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:59.829
 insulting that you always want cold 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.450
 they only go after you 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.219
 because they really just started finding you one 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.530
 without any reason therefor 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:06.819
 and if you know them so 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.199
 you just have to know where you are 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.790
 remain what they come every time 

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:11.409
 so once again you run a chance 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.760
 chilly every time 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:14.739
 and that's just nice about that kind 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.629
 people they try paper town log by 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.189
 week still turning point pepper and after one 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:20.169
 for a while you just have a ten kiss me 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:21.730
 on a person but I'm right 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:24.010
 he only lasted about inside 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.319
 a quick core for four to five minutes 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.989
 strike too and I played a bit of rest 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.400
 and then you want a little russian so it 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.900
 was just a kemp rusk empress 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.729
 chem-dry evil of course the most useful 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.109
 kem strike is to catch and the 

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:36.519
 easiest cam trick is to pick up 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:37.000
 but abyss déplace are already here again 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.129
 on 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.659
 if you have something or if you 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:42.579
 opinion behind praying also surpasses 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:44.290
 cool in the comments because me 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.790
 like to read and have you ever 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.530
 experienced something it after all totally rotten 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.090
 school and then at the following mole 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.409
 against dropped or and luc hour against one 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.099
 drop late please let us know in the 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:52.659
 comments 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:54.189
 we have lost the game but it 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:56.439
 came because I am doing the kem strike 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:57.970
 and the emmys and just the 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:59.709
 leg in the flag and I really thought that 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.449
 just be the first to see them 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.889
 did is run to the b falls to 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:04.359
 perhaps the death surrender 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:05.739
 b-squad when they picked up maybe the dozer 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:07.449
 and a and b from when they picked up maybe the 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.069
 dead and of course not everyone it 

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:11.500
 enemy team is that my scale is broken 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:13.719
 I also have a few fans of mine 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.069
 who recognized me and who ordinary it 

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:16.690
 shell found of course against me too 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.370
 so they just tried the 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.719
 game to win but well- known residue 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.340
 on people were allowed to have large of these 

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:22.900
 kem strike please never give 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.190
 may like regular home likes 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.870
 I am of course very happy again 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.729
 happy unfortunately it had the game 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.680
 but we already had five 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:31.000
 four forties against them so won that 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.320
 one thing for him now is that just fascinates me 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.310
 no reason because I can strike there 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.539
 against honey 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.370
 but of course just fun to 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:38.909
 So do gamer again and again 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.909
 with people
