that<00:01:35.630> they<00:01:35.899> go<00:01:36.079> right<00:01:36.350> up<00:01:36.590> to<00:01:36.619> that<00:01:36.909> pencil

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
that they go right up to that pencil

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.749 
that they go right up to that pencil

letters<00:02:20.340> that's<00:02:20.490> going<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:20.730> create<00:02:20.910> my

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
letters that's going to create my

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.500 
letters that's going to create my
closure<00:02:22.080> but<00:02:22.620> it's<00:02:23.280> buckling<00:02:23.670> a<00:02:23.940> little<00:02:24.270> bit

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
closure but it's buckling a little bit

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.870 
closure but it's buckling a little bit
so<00:02:24.870> that<00:02:24.900> means<00:02:25.410> i<00:02:25.560> need<00:02:25.770> to<00:02:26.280> trim<00:02:26.640> off<00:02:26.820> a

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
because i had some scrap left over so it

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.380
