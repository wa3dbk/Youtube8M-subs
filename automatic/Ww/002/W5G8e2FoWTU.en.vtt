00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 winter has not yet begun but problems in 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.359
 Ukrainian economy is growing like 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.280
 snowball to the fall of the GDP 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.730
 industrial production which we talk a little 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.219
 later 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.820
 unexpected impoverishment was added 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.330
 gold reserve leave aside 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.869
 conspiracy theories 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.300
 Let us turn to the facts at the end of 2013 in 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.949
 National Bank vaults were almost 40 tons 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.660
 gold is eight percent 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.699
 the country's gold reserves but on 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.980
 the head of the National Bank Valery Gontareva 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.710
 stated that the gold bars left 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.010
 quite a bit around percent tvr 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:01:22.700
 and this is a little more than five tons where did it go 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:01:26.939
 the rest is unknown and so I called 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:32.700
 bells upon our birth 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:02:45.920
 of the state and that all the people go without 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:02:48.599
 caps and rejoiced as soon as possible, let's go 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.760
 such meetings place fundamentally 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.560
 marriott can say american 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.050
 territory here lives american 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.099
 the president is allowed into the negotiating room 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.680
 just one camera 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.659
 ago, already at the table, Obama barely manages 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.819
 hide white envelope in the inner 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:05.340
 jacket pocket that Peter gave 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.409
 Poroshenko certainly not for the press for her 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.650
 only a short protocol exchange 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:12.629
 greetings i'm glad we managed 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.170
 meet think ukrainian people 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:17.280
 made a wise choice 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.220
 conditions of the national bank of Ukraine 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.230
 mark and gold revealed show reserves 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.269
 it takes to the essence assigned to the site 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.790
 the process was diluted by the head of the National Bank 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.709
 Valeria Gontareva channel 5 in the interview and 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.959
 really practically if you want 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.150
 find out then in physical form there are none 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.459
 small amount of gold bars 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.799
 gold yes but it is literally probably up to 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.659
 one percent I left the head 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.580
 NBU lap have understood at the place where 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:43.799
 can be seen before the official statistics of the 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.810
 national bank gold narrowly higher 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.430

 Tea Kosh and gold stocks yakin and not 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.400
 I was valery Valeriya Gontareva and target 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.100
 we do not have a bank for a part of Sergey Arbuzov 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.200
 from the same gold one of the greatest nadine 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.120
 their way of measuring cats is the very thing 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.880

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.520
 what have u 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.210
 exactly those 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.060
 stock country which 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.690
 not subject to change as 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.410
 are changing 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:57.300
 paper money so the cost of this 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.729
 currencies will increase it 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.979
 that gold on think for 2012 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:04.050

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:06.150
 on three and such to 100 million dollars 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.400
 at the booth and you thought up 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.620
 metal with incomes the whole bundle bake us 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.199
 narrowly towers which curd this managed 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:18.479
 view of the kind you are journalists of a holiday yacht and 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:20.729
 gold zisk vegetable not immediately cute for these 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:23.250
 the walls is one of the most secretive 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:26.460
 organizations in the world federal reserve 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.320
 system usa this place is closed for any 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.539
 checks over the years 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.300
 Federal Reserve kept 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:35.340
 huge reserves of gold from different countries even 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.800
 in times of economic instability 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.409
 and the crisis could leave their own here 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.570
 savings and not worry for them but 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:45.150
 are they really safe and 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.009
 in general there have they appeared long ago 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.349
 guessing that in the center of the banks of the United States 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:51.150
 gold is not so much that he 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:52.919
 sold it gave a debt or did 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.880
 used as a financial 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:56.460
 surety 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.919
 Germany recently decided to regain everything 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.650
 its gold but the federal reserve stated 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:04.229
 that this is impossible since this operation 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:06.539
 may be delayed until 2020 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:08.969
 then germany asked for permission 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:11.340
 visit the central bank vault to 

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:12.270
 make sure that gold is really 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.759
 are there 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.979
 however, was refused after persistent 

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:19.590
 federal reserve requirements yet 

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:21.599
 opened one of nine vaults however not 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.780
 let the german representatives me 

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:26.310
 enter there do not touch gold 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:28.050
 Germany kept in the United States about half 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.729
 its gold reserves 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:32.310
 so her concern is quite 

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:34.860
 reasonably like the concern of others 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:37.500
 financial institutions of the united states 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:41.099
 known for selling what is really 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:42.960
 does not exist for example in 2012 the bank 

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:45.210
 goldman sucks was selling gold 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:48.000
 certificates claiming they are secured 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:50.099
 real gold from his vaults however 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.139
 as it turns out there is not any gold 

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:54.180
 was and the bank worked on the system 

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:56.820
 fractional reserve on the grounds 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:58.120
 most likely only a few contributors 

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.550
 I will demand back 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:02.620
 and gold if you turn to history in 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:04.660
 second world war usa 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:07.240
 spoke to many countries of Asia and Latin 

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:09.699
 america and africa that since it goes 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:12.460
 war for the safety of their gold reserves 

00:07:09.699 --> 00:07:15.010
 You can not vouch and that these countries should 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:17.500
 allow to take all these stocks to us 

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:19.510
 that they were kept there many countries 

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.410
 and did in return receiving gold 

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:22.270
 certificates 

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:24.400
 however when later they tried 

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:25.090
 return your gold and exchange it for 

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.310
 cash 

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:29.919
 The USA told them that they were certified 

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:32.050
 indeed they have spelling 

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:34.000
 and other mistakes and all this gold 

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:36.520
 still located federal 

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.220
 US backup system its influence 

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:41.620
 increased after the 70s when america 

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:43.600
 stopped providing dollar gold in 

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:45.820
 As a result, he became free to buy and 

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.560
 be sold in the american market 

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:50.110
 dollars is the main reserve 

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:52.449
 currencies and so the United States could essentially 

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:54.760
 tax the whole world continuing 

00:07:52.449 --> 00:07:57.250
 print money and thereby devalues 

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:59.020
 saving other countries now many 

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:01.090
 states are trying to stop being 

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:02.470
 dependent on the dollar as the main 

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:05.050
 world reserve currency 

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:07.930
 their center banks increase their golden 

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:10.180
 stocks seem after so many years the world 

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:14.080
 I decided that I provided the US Federal Reserve 

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:16.410
 too much power to help yandex 

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.410
 grill
