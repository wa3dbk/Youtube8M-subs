00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 so in this video we're going to 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.799
 show how to change a contactor 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:11.460
 stop lights 306 or on another car 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:14.580
 so first step to pull the cash 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.839
 visible from below often a trick of 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.050
 key to the left or to the right and 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:22.320
 sas d'eclyps here you remove then 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.830
 the cache below the steering wheel 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.720
 often there are three vices three vices 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.460
 you remove that with a torx key for 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.410
 all the dungeons on here is the 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:37.230
 only key then the one above no 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.899
 had already removed it to the advanced then 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.100
 you take off the cash counter at there is 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:50.000
 two vices over and vice in 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:55.379
 always below with a torx key 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:58.320
 then you remove the block altogether 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.420
 with the help of screws it's the screws here the 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.210
 currencies that you see here it's for 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:23.580
 remove the meter block or unscrew 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:24.750
 for thierry block counter obvious if 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.890
 you do not arrive right away 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.960
 the counter block tells you to aim 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.299
 directly bolts here you 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.299
 remove the counter block friends 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.290
 once the meter block removed then 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.000
 to lower the steering wheel completely 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.540
 drop the column there are two 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.210
 bolts they are here are the two 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.060
 bolts that are there we removed them 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.890
 to be able to access the column that is 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.030
 standing upright take you off with a wrench 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.259
 of 13 then what you see here the 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.920
 little trick with the sons this is the 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:11.730
 contactor so you shoot at it 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:19.310
 debouches here you go to the thread that 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:23.010
 connects to the contactor to remove the acoss 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:28.080
 here and we make a new contact 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.540
 hours here is the ideal it's hard the 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:36.810
 click is already from below 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:39.560
 in its location here and to connect to it 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.560
 the acoss 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:57.360
 here you are neatly put back 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.630
 the counter block 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.220
 you put the cash center and so 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.950
 following in the same in the reverse order 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.460
 where you disassemble it no but you 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.230
 go back the balls years here you 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:22.540
 put the bolts back with the key of 13 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:25.450
 like just now so I hope that 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:31.240
 this video will help you 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:32.980
 settle your little worries of fire here and 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:46.060
 if you want we can check that 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:48.300
 works here's the works thanks the 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.300
 video
