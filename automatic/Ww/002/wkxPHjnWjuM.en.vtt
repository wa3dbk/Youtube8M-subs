right there and you're going to want to

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.700 
right there and you're going to want to
turn<00:01:27.000> around<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.540> go<00:01:27.600> out<00:01:27.780> this<00:01:27.960> back<00:01:28.259> way<00:01:28.530> and

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
turn around and go out this back way and

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.499 
turn around and go out this back way and
to<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.280> right<00:01:29.490> you'll<00:01:29.759> see<00:01:29.850> when<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.150> leave

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
to the right you'll see when I leave

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.660 
to the right you'll see when I leave
that<00:01:30.810> building<00:01:31.079> right<00:01:31.320> there<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.890> where<00:01:32.189> the

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
that building right there is where the

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.819 
that building right there is where the
3d<00:01:33.030> printer<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.840> I'll<00:01:34.229> kind<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.530> show<00:01:34.590> you

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
3d printer is and I'll kind of show you

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.649 
3d printer is and I'll kind of show you
you<00:01:35.430> can<00:01:35.460> basically<00:01:35.820> just<00:01:36.119> look<00:01:36.329> through<00:01:36.509> the

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
you can basically just look through the

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.840 
you can basically just look through the
window<00:01:36.990> as<00:01:37.170> well<00:01:37.200> when<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.650> exit<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.549> see<00:01:38.729> it

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
window as well when you exit to see it

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.490 
window as well when you exit to see it
and<00:01:38.970> it's<00:01:39.180> right<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:39.600> there<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.259> want<00:01:40.409> to

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
and it's right in there and you want to

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.810 
and it's right in there and you want to
make<00:01:40.619> sure<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.890> go<00:01:41.009> in<00:01:41.130> there<00:01:41.280> get<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.549> gun

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
make sure you go in there get a gun

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.819 
make sure you go in there get a gun
because<00:01:42.060> if<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.329> start<00:01:42.750> getting<00:01:42.960> 25<00:01:43.380> round

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
because if you start getting 25 round

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.560 
because if you start getting 25 round
six<00:01:44.250> rounds<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.790> do<00:01:44.970> not<00:01:45.119> want<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.420> have<00:01:45.540> a

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
six rounds you do not want to have a

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.149 
six rounds you do not want to have a
pistol<00:01:45.869> just<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.439> don't<00:01:46.500> want<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.799> risk<00:01:46.920> it

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
pistol just you don't want to risk it

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.190 
pistol just you don't want to risk it
and<00:01:47.340> if<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.060> get<00:01:48.149> like<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.329> submachine<00:01:48.960> gun

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
and if you get like a submachine gun

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.990 
and if you get like a submachine gun
it's<00:01:49.409> really<00:01:49.710> good<00:01:49.890> for<00:01:50.100> racking<00:01:50.850> up<00:01:50.939> points

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
it's really good for racking up points

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.690 
it's really good for racking up points
early<00:01:51.750> on<00:01:51.840> but<00:01:52.140> obviously<00:01:52.680> not<00:01:52.950> so<00:01:53.310> good<00:01:53.549> at

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
early on but obviously not so good at

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.249 
early on but obviously not so good at
the<00:01:53.820> later<00:01:54.000> rounds<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:55.049> would<00:01:55.170> be<00:01:55.200> my

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
the later rounds so that would be my

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.230 
the later rounds so that would be my
recommendation<00:01:55.409> for<00:01:56.369> racking<00:01:57.000> up<00:01:57.060> some

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
recommendation for racking up some

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.630 
recommendation for racking up some
points<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:57.689> getting<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:57.930> nice<00:01:58.049> SMG<00:01:58.680> this<00:01:59.369> next

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
points is getting a nice SMG this next

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.760 
points is getting a nice SMG this next
area<00:01:59.939> is<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.390> gas<00:02:00.630> station<00:02:01.049> area<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.380> great

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
area is the gas station area a great

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.830 
area is the gas station area a great
place<00:02:02.040> for<00:02:02.250> running<00:02:02.520> train<00:02:02.820> there's<00:02:03.450> an

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
place for running train there's an

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.420 
place for running train there's an
upgrade<00:02:04.290> in<00:02:04.320> there<00:02:04.649> right<00:02:04.829> below<00:02:05.040> where<00:02:05.189> I

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
upgrade in there right below where I

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.449 
upgrade in there right below where I
just<00:02:05.729> jump<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.180> so<00:02:06.509> that's<00:02:06.689> also<00:02:07.459> important

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
just jump to so that's also important

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:08.999 
just jump to so that's also important
thing

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
know what I was talking about but he

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.559 
know what I was talking about but he
found<00:02:20.950> like<00:02:21.280> I<00:02:21.459> think<00:02:21.819> it<00:02:21.970> might<00:02:22.120> be<00:02:22.150> part<00:02:22.510> of

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
found like I think it might be part of

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:23.910 
found like I think it might be part of
the<00:02:22.659> Easter<00:02:22.989> egg<00:02:23.049> or<00:02:23.319> it<00:02:23.409> could<00:02:23.530> just<00:02:23.560> be<00:02:23.709> one

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
the Easter egg or it could just be one

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.470 
the Easter egg or it could just be one
of<00:02:24.010> like<00:02:24.099> the<00:02:24.250> hidden<00:02:24.519> song<00:02:24.760> things<00:02:25.180> that<00:02:25.360> they

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
of like the hidden song things that they

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.289 
of like the hidden song things that they
do<00:02:25.650> that<00:02:26.650> they<00:02:26.739> hide<00:02:26.920> in<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.159> maps<00:02:27.370> and<00:02:27.640> but<00:02:28.120> it

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
do that they hide in the maps and but it

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:31.050 
do that they hide in the maps and but it
very<00:02:28.569> likely<00:02:28.810> could<00:02:29.769> be<00:02:29.980> part<00:02:30.250> of<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.489> part<00:02:31.000> of

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
very likely could be part of the part of

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.059 
very likely could be part of the part of
the<00:02:31.180> easter<00:02:31.720> egg<00:02:31.810> so<00:02:32.140> I<00:02:32.409> was<00:02:32.709> super<00:02:33.040> excited

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579

survivor so I go to him and basically
you<00:03:16.629> have<00:03:16.750> to<00:03:16.870> escort<00:03:17.349> him<00:03:17.620> to<00:03:17.650> an<00:03:18.280> area<00:03:18.489> on<00:03:18.699> the

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 
you have to escort him to an area on the

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.030 
you have to escort him to an area on the
map<00:03:19.109> sometimes<00:03:20.109> it's<00:03:20.349> the<00:03:20.530> main<00:03:20.709> area<00:03:20.980> where

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
map sometimes it's the main area where

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.670 
map sometimes it's the main area where
you<00:03:21.160> start<00:03:21.569> this<00:03:22.569> time<00:03:22.840> you'll<00:03:23.079> see<00:03:23.139> it's<00:03:23.470> like

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
you start this time you'll see it's like

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.800 
you start this time you'll see it's like
just<00:03:24.129> off<00:03:24.340> in<00:03:24.639> a<00:03:24.699> corner<00:03:24.940> kind<00:03:25.510> of<00:03:25.599> a<00:03:25.629> random

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
just off in a corner kind of a random

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.449 
just off in a corner kind of a random
corner<00:03:26.290> with<00:03:26.440> a<00:03:26.470> flare<00:03:26.799> so<00:03:27.010> you<00:03:27.069> just<00:03:27.160> keep<00:03:27.310> an

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
corner with a flare so you just keep an

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.069 
corner with a flare so you just keep an
eye<00:03:27.519> out<00:03:27.549> for<00:03:27.819> that<00:03:27.849> player<00:03:28.209> and<00:03:28.449> you<00:03:28.900> just

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
eye out for that player and you just

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:30.449 
eye out for that player and you just
kind<00:03:29.260> of<00:03:29.319> walk<00:03:29.500> with<00:03:29.709> the<00:03:29.799> survivor<00:03:30.190> and<00:03:30.430> I

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
kind of walk with the survivor and I

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.280 
kind of walk with the survivor and I
think<00:03:30.669> he<00:03:30.790> automatically<00:03:31.419> goes<00:03:31.660> to<00:03:31.690> that<00:03:32.019> area

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
think he automatically goes to that area

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.189 
think he automatically goes to that area
and<00:03:32.739> you<00:03:33.040> just<00:03:33.190> got<00:03:33.340> to<00:03:33.370> protect<00:03:33.790> them<00:03:33.970> and<00:03:34.599> if

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:35.199 
and you just got to protect them and if

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:37.740 
and you just got to protect them and if
you<00:03:35.319> get<00:03:35.949> them<00:03:36.069> to<00:03:36.190> escape<00:03:36.430> later<00:03:36.879> on<00:03:37.120> they

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
you get them to escape later on they

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.930 
you get them to escape later on they
will<00:03:37.870> give<00:03:38.109> you<00:03:38.290> a<00:03:38.530> weapon<00:03:38.799> upgrade<00:03:39.340> which<00:03:39.669> is

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
will give you a weapon upgrade which is

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.300 
will give you a weapon upgrade which is
I<00:03:40.209> mean<00:03:40.540> that's<00:03:40.690> like<00:03:40.840> 2,500<00:03:41.799> points<00:03:41.980> so

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
I mean that's like 2,500 points so

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.640 
I mean that's like 2,500 points so
that's<00:03:42.459> a<00:03:42.730> pretty<00:03:43.180> significant<00:03:43.989> you<00:03:44.530> know

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
that's a pretty significant you know

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.140 
that's a pretty significant you know
upgrade<00:03:45.099> if<00:03:45.190> you<00:03:45.250> have<00:03:45.370> four<00:03:45.579> players<00:03:45.790> you

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
upgrade if you have four players you

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.089 
upgrade if you have four players you
know<00:03:46.239> that's<00:03:46.419> 2,500<00:03:47.169> for<00:03:47.319> each<00:03:47.500> player's<00:03:47.889> so

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
know that's 2,500 for each player's so

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:51.750 
know that's 2,500 for each player's so
that's<00:03:48.250> huge<00:03:49.199> the<00:03:50.199> penalty<00:03:50.560> that<00:03:50.709> I<00:03:51.069> got<00:03:51.459> when

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
that's huge the penalty that I got when

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.409 
that's huge the penalty that I got when
I<00:03:51.819> didn't<00:03:52.329> get<00:03:52.780> him<00:03:52.959> to<00:03:53.109> escape<00:03:53.319> was<00:03:53.739> a<00:03:54.389> like<00:03:55.389> a

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:55.419 
I didn't get him to escape was a like a

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:57.390 
I didn't get him to escape was a like a
power<00:03:55.780> outage<00:03:56.109> so<00:03:56.560> like<00:03:56.739> the<00:03:56.889> power<00:03:57.099> turned

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
power outage so like the power turned

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.099 
power outage so like the power turned
off<00:03:57.639> a<00:03:57.669> while<00:03:57.940> so<00:03:58.120> I<00:03:58.150> couldn't<00:03:58.449> buy<00:03:58.540> it<00:03:58.599> jogging

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
off a while so I couldn't buy it jogging

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:01.289 
off a while so I couldn't buy it jogging
or<00:03:59.409> juggernaut<00:04:00.099> excuse<00:04:00.549> me<00:04:00.669> and<00:04:00.909> all<00:04:01.150> that

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
or juggernaut excuse me and all that

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.449 
or juggernaut excuse me and all that
stuff<00:04:01.419> which<00:04:01.959> isn't<00:04:02.319> like<00:04:02.440> a<00:04:02.680> huge<00:04:03.250> thing

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
stuff which isn't like a huge thing

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.539 
stuff which isn't like a huge thing
because<00:04:03.669> it<00:04:03.790> restores<00:04:04.150> pretty<00:04:04.449> quickly<00:04:04.720> so<00:04:05.549> i

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
because it restores pretty quickly so i

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.000 
because it restores pretty quickly so i
think<00:04:07.000> the<00:04:07.120> reward<00:04:07.510> is<00:04:07.720> just<00:04:07.989> the<00:04:08.229> big<00:04:08.409> part<00:04:08.769> it

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
think the reward is just the big part it

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.710 
think the reward is just the big part it
sucks<00:04:09.459> if<00:04:09.639> you<00:04:09.729> don't<00:04:09.879> get<00:04:10.030> that<00:04:10.209> reward<00:04:10.359> they

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
sucks if you don't get that reward they

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.890 
sucks if you don't get that reward they
don't<00:04:10.900> punish<00:04:11.139> you

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900

kind of a camping spot that I found that

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.360 
kind of a camping spot that I found that
I<00:04:34.789> like<00:04:35.120> to<00:04:35.330> use<00:04:35.509> a<00:04:35.539> lot<00:04:35.930> and<00:04:36.229> before<00:04:36.710> people<00:04:37.280> i

think this camping spot could be the key
