00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.460 
see how it slides in slides in sideways
and<00:01:53.229> then<00:01:54.229> you<00:01:54.439> just<00:01:55.009> slide<00:01:55.280> this<00:01:55.520> plastic

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
and then you just slide this plastic

so basically you just hold it like this
and<00:02:07.600> you<00:02:08.600> start<00:02:08.810> turning<00:02:14.560> and<00:02:15.560> it<00:02:16.489> basically

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640
