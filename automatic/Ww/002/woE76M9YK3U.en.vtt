00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.530
 good these fears studies that no 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:10.009
 we will see on television the 

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:11.389
 University of Monsters in which good 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:14.269
 Video games are a great help 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.799
 for people who are shy and so on 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:17.870
 good according to this study said 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:21.110
 shy people more likely to do 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:23.540
 friends in online videogames that in the 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.990
 that are not really good I do not think 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.640
 so be it in 100% of cases 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.870
 logically but I know that the games what 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.090
 I know from experience of online games 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.610
 by 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.810
 if you are a shy person and so on 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.800
 they will help you make friends really 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:41.030
 it's not really how you say it 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.500
 our face to that person can you 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.120
 speak directly can show you 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.070
 how are you maybe you have all day 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.199
 without talking in class at school other 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.660
 and well you vent online then 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:52.790
 talking to your friends that for some 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.670
 people because online friends are not 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:58.840
 really friends, not if you can not 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.680
 touch the cock and suck the ass 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.759
 literally well, they are not your 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.250
 friends that's a bit I do not know very very 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:08.509
 mothers of this one 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.729
 this century the truth but good 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:13.040
 I really think that good follow dessert 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.930
 a friend who is online and not online 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.030
 have seen in people and others yes that 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.750
 it's true as I say because friendship is 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.890
 much more than having a friend by your side 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.170
 let's go right now 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.120
 it's much more than that although there are 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.250
 good times and bad but good 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.320
 is not that the issue is not basically so 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.600
 Shyness is a problem 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.210
 great I have suffered it many 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.440
 people that good in the summer good 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.800
 what kind of shyness I am ashamed of 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.560
 to ask the time good there is shyness 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:47.130
 so timid not to me well then I before 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.720
 I preferred that I know how to get lost in the 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.430
 street before you ask before 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.140
 you ask someone where it 's going to 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.930
 I do not prefer to miss this site before 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.149
 to ask is not something pretty fucked 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.560
 sometimes to bring yes that certain change 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.270
 online games and other well yes I 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.270
 have helped, not simply 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.310
 by losing shyness and not over 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.710
 find a girlfriend and others I the truth that 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.990
 well this study has been necessary for 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.820
 know this but good I know that many 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.430
 other people who are more skeptical 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.830
 about the use of video games in this 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.070
 well, yes, you will need to know 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.350
 no and above all good people who do not 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.120
 mothers and others and parents who have children 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.360
 and it's good that your children do not 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.710
 they relate in the street other good I 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.660
 I think that an online video game 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.090
 usually come you can come well not for 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.860
 meet their peers and whatnot 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.709
 to open a little more to the world not the 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.390
 shyness or because it is something difficult to 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.130
 face many times is not enough 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.770
 with tell the author and play and has pressed 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.300
 directly because not if you have to 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.520
 to do otherwise polar to another way 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.800
 Of course you can meet that person 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:55.670
 in person then well and if not then well 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:58.070
 also the relationship between a person and 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.410
 another is not based on training the forward 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.620
 but in being able to talk to her could 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.000
 exchange opinion information and others 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.770
 so well nothing more kids this has 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.550
 been everything and nothing we go in the next 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.550
 video until next time
