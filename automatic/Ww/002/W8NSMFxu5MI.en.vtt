00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
larger area and because we're only

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.569 
larger area and because we're only
talking<00:03:42.620> about<00:03:42.980> a<00:03:43.939> small<00:03:44.590> piece<00:03:45.590> that<00:03:45.950> is<00:03:46.159> just

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
talking about a small piece that is just

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:48.250 
talking about a small piece that is just
there<00:03:46.819> to<00:03:46.849> fill<00:03:47.239> in<00:03:47.450> a<00:03:47.690> little<00:03:47.989> bit<00:03:48.170> of

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
there to fill in a little bit of

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.770 
there to fill in a little bit of
thinning<00:03:48.760> it<00:03:49.760> can<00:03:50.000> be<00:03:50.090> very<00:03:50.299> very<00:03:50.480> lightweight

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
thinning it can be very very lightweight

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.839 
thinning it can be very very lightweight
so<00:03:50.959> it's<00:03:51.200> comfortable<00:03:51.440> but<00:03:52.010> it's<00:03:52.190> also<00:03:52.370> very

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
so it's comfortable but it's also very

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.420 
so it's comfortable but it's also very
natural
