years<00:01:10.500> ago<00:01:10.729> I<00:01:11.729> thought<00:01:12.600> English<00:01:13.530> football<00:01:14.009> was

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
years ago I thought English football was

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.630 
years ago I thought English football was
was<00:01:15.200> not<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.619> most<00:01:16.860> high<00:01:17.160> level<00:01:17.700> football<00:01:19.640> but

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
was not the most high level football but

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.310 
was not the most high level football but
now<00:01:21.470> because<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:23.250> influence<00:01:23.580> also<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.600> the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
now because of the influence also of the

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.060 
now because of the influence also of the
European<00:01:25.350> players<00:01:26.220> are<00:01:26.580> playing<00:01:27.000> or<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:28.070> the

European players are playing or the the

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.609

and<00:01:42.929> different<00:01:43.410> styles<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:45.300> like<00:01:45.539> that

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
and different styles and I like that

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.100 
and different styles and I like that
because<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:47.580> do<00:01:47.670> think<00:01:48.149> that<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.720> is

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
because I I do think that that is

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.469 
because I I do think that that is
important

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.760 

I<00:01:54.490> think<00:01:55.689> with<00:01:56.689> the<00:01:56.869> quality<00:01:57.320> of<00:01:57.350> the

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
I think with the quality of the

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.520 
I think with the quality of the
selection<00:01:58.310> I<00:01:58.460> choose<00:01:58.969> this<00:01:59.240> system<00:01:59.689> and<00:01:59.930> I

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
selection I choose this system and I

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.539 
selection I choose this system and I
always<00:02:00.829> do<00:02:01.159> that<00:02:01.189> because<00:02:01.700> I<00:02:02.649> am<00:02:03.649> more<00:02:04.100> in

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
always do that because I am more in

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:09.759 
always do that because I am more in
favor<00:02:04.939> for<00:02:05.329> a<00:02:05.810> 1<00:02:06.320> 4<00:02:06.710> 3<00:02:07.039> 3<00:02:07.429> C's<00:02:07.759> system<00:02:08.420> what<00:02:09.259> what

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
favor for a 1 4 3 3 C's system what what

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.900 
favor for a 1 4 3 3 C's system what what
also<00:02:10.280> Sir<00:02:11.000> Alec<00:02:11.330> has<00:02:11.540> played<00:02:11.810> but<00:02:12.800> I<00:02:13.280> think

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
also Sir Alec has played but I think

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.830 
also Sir Alec has played but I think
with<00:02:14.269> the<00:02:14.480> selection<00:02:15.019> now<00:02:15.670> I<00:02:16.670> have<00:02:17.300> to<00:02:17.569> choose

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
with the selection now I have to choose

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.680 
with the selection now I have to choose
for<00:02:18.140> this<00:02:18.349> system
