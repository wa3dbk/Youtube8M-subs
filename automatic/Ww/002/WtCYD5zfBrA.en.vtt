it's the second biggest yeah it's a

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.699 
it's the second biggest yeah it's a
second<00:02:09.039> biggest<00:02:09.190> of<00:02:09.580> the<00:02:09.729> year<00:02:10.019> besides<00:02:11.019> Royal

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
out i think is what they usually put the

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.699 
out i think is what they usually put the
Elimination<00:02:18.760> Chamber<00:02:19.000> in<00:02:19.330> but<00:02:20.200> those<00:02:20.500> are

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
Elimination Chamber in but those are

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.110 
Elimination Chamber in but those are
like<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:21.010> four<00:02:21.310> top<00:02:23.040> like<00:02:24.040> main<00:02:24.310> events<00:02:24.489> but

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
like the four top like main events but

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.850 
like the four top like main events but
summer<00:02:25.360> slams<00:02:25.660> number<00:02:26.019> two<00:02:26.260> and<00:02:26.530> then<00:02:26.620> roll

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
summer slams number two and then roll

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.619 
summer slams number two and then roll
rumble<00:02:27.099> would<00:02:27.340> be<00:02:27.430> three<00:02:27.910> so<00:02:28.780> why<00:02:29.739> not<00:02:29.920> have

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
rumble would be three so why not have

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.449 
rumble would be three so why not have
Brock<00:02:31.629> Lesnar<00:02:32.170> when<00:02:32.379> they're<00:02:32.620> like<00:02:32.950> triple<00:02:33.340> H

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
Brock Lesnar when they're like triple H

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.809 
Brock Lesnar when they're like triple H
is<00:02:33.489> one<00:02:34.000> all<00:02:34.209> the<00:02:34.239> time<00:02:35.099> Ryan<00:02:36.099> Braun<00:02:36.400> swings

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
is one all the time Ryan Braun swings

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.660

and<00:02:37.239> he<00:02:37.450> misses<00:02:37.690> right<00:02:38.019> there<00:02:38.349> so<00:02:39.160> if<00:02:39.400> you<00:02:39.519> guys

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
and he misses right there so if you guys

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.800 
and he misses right there so if you guys
think<00:02:39.900> Brock<00:02:40.900> Lesnar<00:02:41.349> should<00:02:41.590> win<00:02:42.569> spose<00:02:43.569> at

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810
