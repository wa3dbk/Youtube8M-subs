Southern California so

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.870 
Southern California so
I<00:00:55.880> don't<00:00:56.540> know

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:58.880 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.420 

how<00:00:59.390> long<00:00:59.660> it<00:00:59.870> take<00:01:00.080> for<00:01:00.710> it<00:01:00.800> to<00:01:00.830> get<00:01:01.100> to<00:01:01.340> the

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
how long it take for it to get to the

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.210 

shouldn't<00:01:06.979> be<00:01:07.450> too

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
shouldn't be too

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.720 
shouldn't be too
much<00:01:10.760> of<00:01:10.970> a<00:01:11.060> difference

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:14.730 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.400 

it<00:01:14.970> should<00:01:15.180> be<00:01:15.210> too<00:01:15.450> much<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.660> a<00:01:15.930> difference

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
it should be too much of a difference

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.270 
it should be too much of a difference
considering

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.370 

these<00:01:21.820> things<00:01:22.030> are<00:01:22.299> shipped<00:01:22.659> by<00:01:22.840> air

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.910 

anyway<00:01:27.250> I'm<00:01:28.030> testing<00:01:28.539> the<00:01:28.630> mic<00:01:28.810> out<00:01:29.049> I'm<00:01:29.710> not

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
anyway I'm testing the mic out I'm not

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.850 
anyway I'm testing the mic out I'm not
entirely<00:01:30.610> sure<00:01:30.820> how<00:01:31.210> it<00:01:31.360> sounds<00:01:31.869> hopefully<00:01:32.770> it

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
entirely sure how it sounds hopefully it

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.520 
entirely sure how it sounds hopefully it
doesn't<00:01:33.009> pick<00:01:33.250> up<00:01:33.369> much<00:01:33.579> wind<00:01:33.880> noise

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
doesn't pick up much wind noise

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.920 
doesn't pick up much wind noise
hopefully<00:01:35.530> it<00:01:35.649> picks<00:01:35.770> up<00:01:35.979> a<00:01:36.100> lot<00:01:36.130> of

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.140 

it<00:01:39.620> picks<00:01:39.890> up<00:01:40.010> a<00:01:40.160> lot<00:01:40.190> of<00:01:40.430> the<00:01:40.550> engine<00:01:40.940> noise

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
it picks up a lot of the engine noise

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.760 
it picks up a lot of the engine noise
and<00:01:41.630> hopefully<00:01:42.140> my<00:01:42.290> voice<00:01:42.470> is<00:01:42.740> clear<00:01:42.920> and<00:01:43.310> nice

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
and hopefully my voice is clear and nice

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.960 
and hopefully my voice is clear and nice
obviously<00:01:45.770> this<00:01:45.890> is<00:01:46.040> a<00:01:46.070> 68<00:01:46.760> sent<00:01:47.060> Mike<00:01:47.270> so

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.030 

my<00:01:50.570> arm

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.710 

expectations<00:01:54.040> are<00:01:54.189> too<00:01:54.460> high

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
expectations are too high

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.330 
expectations are too high
but<00:01:56.050> who<00:01:56.170> knows<00:01:56.350> maybe<00:01:56.680> these<00:01:56.950> things<00:01:57.190> will

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
but who knows maybe these things will

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.800 
but who knows maybe these things will
blow<00:01:57.520> me<00:01:57.730> away

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.190 

and<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:02.040> guess<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.060> software<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:03.600> viewers<00:02:03.990> to

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
and I guess it software you viewers to

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.660 
and I guess it software you viewers to
decide<00:02:04.560> whether<00:02:04.829> it's<00:02:05.100> good<00:02:05.310> or<00:02:05.340> not

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.230 

hopefully<00:02:09.240> it<00:02:09.360> does<00:02:09.509> its<00:02:09.690> job

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
hopefully it does its job

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.309 
hopefully it does its job
and<00:02:11.360> uh<00:02:11.390> you<00:02:12.050> know

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
and uh you know

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.369

really nice and uh hopefully this

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
really nice and uh hopefully this
hopefully<00:03:40.360> this<00:03:40.600> um<00:03:41.760> Mike<00:03:42.760> makes<00:03:43.090> it<00:03:43.300> better

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
hopefully this um Mike makes it better

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.370 
hopefully this um Mike makes it better
because<00:03:44.200> I'm<00:03:44.410> obviously<00:03:44.740> the<00:03:46.020> in<00:03:47.020> camera

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
because I'm obviously the in camera

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.190 
because I'm obviously the in camera
microphone<00:03:48.010> is<00:03:48.400> terrible<00:03:49.000> especially<00:03:49.870> out<00:03:50.170> in

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
microphone is terrible especially out in

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.840 
microphone is terrible especially out in
this<00:03:50.500> sort<00:03:50.800> of<00:03:52.020> road<00:03:53.020> conditions<00:03:53.650> and<00:03:53.920> all

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
this sort of road conditions and all

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.940 
this sort of road conditions and all
that<00:03:55.180> wind<00:03:55.390> noise<00:03:55.690> all<00:03:55.990> you<00:03:56.170> can<00:03:56.350> hear<00:03:56.560> is<00:03:56.680> wind

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
that wind noise all you can hear is wind

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.430 
that wind noise all you can hear is wind
so<00:03:57.520> hopefully<00:03:58.000> by<00:03:58.030> putting<00:03:58.660> this<00:03:58.930> microphone

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
so hopefully by putting this microphone

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:05.430 
so hopefully by putting this microphone
in<00:03:59.740> my<00:03:59.770> helmet<00:04:01.680> it<00:04:02.680> just<00:04:03.460> gets<00:04:04.360> rid<00:04:04.540> of<00:04:04.570> that<00:04:04.810> so

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
in my helmet it just gets rid of that so

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:13.510 
in my helmet it just gets rid of that so
I'm<00:04:06.190> hopeful<00:04:07.110> also<00:04:09.780> what<00:04:10.780> was<00:04:10.960> it

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:13.520 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.830 

I<00:04:14.020> guess<00:04:15.020> I

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
I guess I

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.720 
I guess I
