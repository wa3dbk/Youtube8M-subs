00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.850 
and a laser printer and of course
everything's<00:01:55.799> hooked<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.369> power<00:01:57.060> inverter

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
everything's hooked to a power inverter

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.719 
everything's hooked to a power inverter
so<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:59.009> gives<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.340> power<00:01:59.549> source<00:01:59.909> but<00:02:00.539> uh

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
so it gives it a power source but uh

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:08.080 
so it gives it a power source but uh
what<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:02.759> do<00:02:02.880> is<00:02:03.799> investigations<00:02:05.360> so<00:02:06.360> here's<00:02:06.959> a
