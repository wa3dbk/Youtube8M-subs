00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.670
 today I find you for you 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.630
 show how to make a manicure 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.559
 peas in three different ways 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.210
 first with a jogging hen 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:20.120
 I use this double-ended him 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.210
 at bourjois and when we do not have 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:25.780
 doubt he flows with one when his chemo 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.780
 or an old pen 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.170
 before anything else you will need 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:33.710
 of a base of a varnish of the color of 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.510
 your choice 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.790
 I opted for an old rose on the 16th 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.649
 03 always from at home of a beauty 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.450
 white varnish me I use leblanc 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.130
 bourjois's love 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.560
 and a support of an absorbent me 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.540
 I use paper of abuse we start 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.060
 by applying its base and its varnish and 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.470
 we wait for it to dry 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:58.640
 a few drops of polish on his 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:01:01.230
 support first awaits the outing hen 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.530
 we dipped in the varnish and we put on 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.530
 the nail 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.610
 and M 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.860
 I like when the fish well 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.479
 regular I trace so a first 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.439
 line in the middle of long and the 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.439
 following staggered 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.299
 m 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.890
 now with the buncher we're going 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.450
 start with the cards and since we're going 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.230
 to use small round end have 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.230
 drawn peas 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.200
 we put varnish on its support and 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.490
 as for the outing toul in 30 in 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.490
 the varnish and we put on the nail 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.840
 and 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
 and 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.160
 finally with the pen the principle is 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.150
 always the same we put the varnish in 30 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.150
 and we draw wood 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.450
 m 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.470
 and 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.480
 and voila I hope this 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.170
 video you liked take care of your 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.170
 hands those of the goal
