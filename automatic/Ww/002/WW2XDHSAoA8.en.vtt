00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.980
 hello girls this new video in 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.990
 this video I'll show you how 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.039
 used the led lamp issues 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.980
 permanent 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.970
 I did several tests really did 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.400
 super-positive so decided to register 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.499
 this video where I also tell you all the 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.630
 tips that I know from practice to 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:28.249
 have a good permanent signs and tell you 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.050
 that now with these tips with the 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:32.660
 led lamp lasts me from two to three 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.579
 weeks always semi-permanent then 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.100
 I am overjoyed 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:40.039
 we come to the first thing you take the 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.629
 solvent and remove the remnants of 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:44.210
 enamel that may be on the 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.790
 surface removing it well in all its 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.370
 point 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.350
 now let's take the qt with the way it 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.320
 famous made another video where it 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.900
 I speak is gorgeous it is a joker that cuticles 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.760
 removes all all the cuticles and it's off 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.800
 very well both in the reconstruction and 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.780
 not semi-permanent I refer you to that 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.310
 video to understand you what anyway 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.170
 you put it on the surface 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.850
 push the cuticles back me 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.220
 I recommend pushes canvases well and you do 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.930
 especially the sides because so many yes 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.240
 they forget the sides but they are there too 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.729
 the cuticles I recommend is a ride 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.100
 fundamental because also in the seeds 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.410
 permanent is very important to me 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.150
 I recommend let you talk here and be at 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.190
 inch because during work 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.170
 obviously bumped and ripped into 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.180
 very strong production so if it is 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.950
 left the nail then I take it 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.640
 flash scheme that a kind of mockery 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:36.009
 let's say so many disinfectant cleansers 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.690
 you don't use the normal cleanser 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.400
 the important thing you go about cheating 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.570
 really very well the surface e 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.970
 also the side ones 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.970
 take a file will not have visual then 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.430
 a 240 and file the nail I recommend 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.770
 he will not have visual, otherwise you will go to 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.960
 thin the nails and stress them 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.700
 now take the opacified buffer the 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.110
 surface I recommend you always do it 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.390
 this step because the seeds 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.550
 permanent lasted longer is a buffer 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.200
 so if you do it gently don't ruin it 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.000
 thins leung and therefore you are 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.470
 do not worry because so many have terror 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.700
 in this passage but really 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.260
 quiet 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.390
 now let's take the base which is nothing else 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.370
 which must moisturizing we place it on 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.080
 all the nails I'm using whimsically 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.150
 because you know that they alternate fancifully 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.459
 congeli we find ourselves from God with all and 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.040
 two absolutely does not change a brand or 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.390
 the other dries in the air anyway now 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.160
 we take cooked dÃ©faillance there 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.080
 especially if you use whimsical advice 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.360
 because it then helps you in removing me 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.670
 I also find it very well what you do 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.660
 a very thin state cover the 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.920
 surface 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.989
 I advise you to do a finger for 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.780
 once you put a finger in the lamp 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.549
 led the led court lamp catalyses 30 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.680
 seconds you understand that she has made one 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:44.230
 mom and then the other seconds pass e 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.750
 you don't even notice the important thing 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.440
 to one thing even when you do this 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.570
 passage 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.549
 also cover the tip well but 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.579
 be careful not to put too much product 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.230
 on the tip, if not, it will rise 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:58.120
 in tip easily 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.590
 I now what comfort to show you the 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.720
 video I made two nails but you 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.340
 I recommend a nail the time between 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.109
 other things the four fingers you can 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.209
 put it together but the thumb goes 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:09.100
 absolutely put me alone 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.109
 I recommend it should be put on its own 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.820
 now take a brush and remove it 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:15.459
 another passage was dispersive 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.139
 important that will then help you roll out 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.880
 more easily the color 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:22.150
 I saw a clear change too 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.590
 removing the dispersive state and I wanted 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.070
 just show you that in the street now 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:30.730
 I also sold 14 excuses 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:33.340
 from 14 ml passed from 7 to the youngest 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.840
 it costs less and in my opinion it is very good 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.150
 especially at such a time that 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.079
 you can't spend so much money 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.970
 so in fact I chose that one 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:43.419
 I liked this little color 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.400
 so much because it was for the eternal glik 2 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:47.470
 that is, excuse yourself, slightly glittered 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.970
 so very nice for this period 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.820
 however what you have to do when at 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.459
 ciance roll out day1 a pass of 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.440
 very very thin nail polish me 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.810
 I recommend very thin because it is 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.730
 color thickness really makes text 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.829
 in the duration therefore very thin and 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.109
 cover the tip one finger at a time 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:06.820
 put lamp on some catalyst 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:08.709
 second then take out and do 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.389
 to the other nail obviously if you are 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.160
 doing it on another person is easy 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:13.780
 because done one hand at a time 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.329
 I recommend this step a lot 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.030
 very important is the led lamp e 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.519
 catalyze 30 seconds I tell you that i 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.910
 especially dark colors a few seconds 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.310
 more 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.050
 you have to give two passes always so 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.790
 thin fake thing in this step 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.889
 what do you obviously believe the 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.020
 fixer which is the polishing top coat 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:34.660
 according to the brand you also use here 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.940
 it should be laid a little less than the enamel ie 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.250
 in the sense a slightly more state 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.710
 plentiful but I recommend also here 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.449
 cover the tip and sides for the 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.270
 semi permanent problem yes 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:48.100
 just remove the tip then that 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.620
 very important step 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.460
 put lamp on always catalyze 30 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.710
 seconds 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.900
 take out degreased oil and this is it 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.410
 the end result is not much 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.690
 to say 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.030
 in the last part, however, there are many 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.400
 very important tricks to do yes 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.450
 that semi-permanently lasts longer and is 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.600
 truly a beautiful goal 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.730
 in my opinion 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.340
 however the led lamp is pretty cool 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:12.320
 sorry the term but really good 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.220
 a big face all to the next video 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.220
 Hello
