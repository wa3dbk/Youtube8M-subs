in<00:02:31.250> it<00:02:31.370> yeah<00:02:32.260> that<00:02:33.260> takes<00:02:33.530> a<00:02:33.680> lot<00:02:33.890> of<00:02:33.950> effort

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
in it yeah that takes a lot of effort

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.190 
in it yeah that takes a lot of effort
this<00:02:34.520> is<00:02:34.580> not<00:02:34.940> machine<00:02:35.360> stuff<00:02:35.690> folks<00:02:38.200> because

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
this is not machine stuff folks because

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:46.450 
this is not machine stuff folks because
it<00:02:39.410> is<00:02:43.360> obviously<00:02:44.360> not<00:02:45.170> let's<00:02:46.100> just<00:02:46.250> put<00:02:46.400> it

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
it is obviously not let's just put it

00:02:46.460 --> 00:03:05.410 
it is obviously not let's just put it
this<00:02:46.490> way<00:02:46.730> it's<00:02:47.210> not<00:02:47.450> material<00:02:48.410> like<00:03:04.420> boom

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
this way it's not material like boom

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.150 
this way it's not material like boom
because<00:03:05.690> a<00:03:05.810> she's<00:03:05.989> a<00:03:06.140> she's<00:03:06.170> really<00:03:06.800> exceeded

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
because a she's a she's really exceeded

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.280 
because a she's a she's really exceeded
took<00:03:07.400> that<00:03:07.700> she<00:03:07.880> hid<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:08.209> tag<00:03:08.450> already<00:03:08.750> on<00:03:09.110> it

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
took that she hid the tag already on it

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.860 
took that she hid the tag already on it
so<00:03:09.500> she<00:03:09.940> has<00:03:10.940> a<00:03:10.970> tag<00:03:11.330> on<00:03:13.420> which<00:03:14.420> you<00:03:14.540> can<00:03:14.660> wear

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
so she has a tag on which you can wear

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.370 
so she has a tag on which you can wear
it<00:03:14.989> with<00:03:15.140> a<00:03:15.170> belt<00:03:15.320> or<00:03:15.739> without<00:03:16.100> a<00:03:16.130> bell<00:03:16.459> her

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
it with a belt or without a bell her

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.360 
it with a belt or without a bell her
