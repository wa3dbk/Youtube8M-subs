00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:25.890 

and<00:02:18.310> since<00:02:19.620> hopefully<00:02:20.620> that<00:02:20.800> works

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.039 

okay<00:02:26.530> looks<00:02:27.069> like<00:02:27.220> it<00:02:27.400> worked<00:02:27.689> let's<00:02:28.689> see<00:02:28.840> if<00:02:28.959> i

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
okay looks like it worked let's see if i

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:31.380 
okay looks like it worked let's see if i
go<00:02:29.230> to<00:02:29.290> my<00:02:29.470> dash<00:02:29.829> home<00:02:30.280> and<00:02:30.879> i<00:02:31.060> searched

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
go to my dash home and i searched

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.970 
go to my dash home and i searched
hardware<00:02:32.610> Arguelles<00:02:33.610> sensor<00:02:34.090> there<00:02:34.329> you<00:02:34.450> go

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
hardware Arguelles sensor there you go

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.259 
hardware Arguelles sensor there you go
and<00:02:36.480> again<00:02:37.530> go<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.680> your<00:02:38.799> preferences<00:02:39.340> I<00:02:39.670> took

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
and again go to your preferences I took

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.860 
and again go to your preferences I took
about<00:02:40.629> go<00:02:41.110> to<00:02:41.170> preferences<00:02:42.099> and<00:02:42.720> you<00:02:43.720> just

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
about go to preferences and you just

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.280 
about go to preferences and you just
start<00:02:44.079> automatically<00:02:44.769> again<00:02:45.930> i'm<00:02:46.930> over<00:02:47.140> i'm

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
start automatically again i'm over i'm

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.569 
start automatically again i'm over i'm
in<00:02:47.379> a<00:02:47.470> virtual<00:02:47.769> machine<00:02:47.799> so<00:02:48.189> i<00:02:48.250> really<00:02:48.459> don't

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
in a virtual machine so i really don't

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.490 
in a virtual machine so i really don't
have<00:02:48.879> any<00:02:49.030> sensors<00:02:49.480> on<00:02:49.689> this<00:02:49.989> virtual<00:02:50.290> machine

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
have any sensors on this virtual machine

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.020 
have any sensors on this virtual machine
but<00:02:50.650> most<00:02:50.829> likely<00:02:50.980> if<00:02:51.280> you<00:02:51.370> guys<00:02:51.549> do<00:02:51.819> have<00:02:52.000> a

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
but most likely if you guys do have a

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.550 
but most likely if you guys do have a
physical<00:02:52.510> machine<00:02:52.569> you<00:02:52.959> install<00:02:53.290> your<00:02:53.409> boom

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
physical machine you install your boom

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.250 
physical machine you install your boom
see<00:02:53.769> you<00:02:54.400> try<00:02:54.640> this<00:02:54.700> app<00:02:55.030> without<00:02:55.269> hey<00:02:55.810> leave<00:02:56.230> a

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
see you try this app without hey leave a
