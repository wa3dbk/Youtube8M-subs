00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
on fire you know as a way to like try to

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.840 
on fire you know as a way to like try to
try<00:01:34.810> to<00:01:34.869> burn<00:01:35.320> some<00:01:35.500> of<00:01:35.530> these<00:01:35.680> keys<00:01:35.950> and

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
they're made out of porcelain and so

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.370 
they're made out of porcelain and so
they<00:01:39.759> shouldn't<00:01:40.210> go<00:01:40.329> anywhere<00:01:40.750> so<00:01:41.020> everything

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380
