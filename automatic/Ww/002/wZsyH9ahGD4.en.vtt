hi<00:00:03.120> that<00:00:03.419> today<00:00:04.200> we<00:00:04.350> are<00:00:04.410> going<00:00:04.529> to<00:00:04.650> perform<00:00:04.799> a

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
hi that today we are going to perform a

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.550 
hi that today we are going to perform a
very<00:00:05.250> simple<00:00:05.670> experiment<00:00:06.359> which<00:00:07.290> you<00:00:07.410> can

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
very simple experiment which you can

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.600 
very simple experiment which you can
even<00:00:07.710> do<00:00:07.950> at<00:00:08.069> home<00:00:09.110> this<00:00:10.110> experiment<00:00:10.800> will

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
even do at home this experiment will

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.749 
even do at home this experiment will
demonstrate<00:00:11.969> a<00:00:12.630> very<00:00:13.380> unique<00:00:13.830> property<00:00:14.580> of

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
demonstrate a very unique property of

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.130 
demonstrate a very unique property of
water<00:00:15.500> known<00:00:16.500> as<00:00:16.529> its<00:00:16.859> surface<00:00:17.220> tension<00:00:18.140> let's

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
water known as its surface tension let's

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:26.779 
water known as its surface tension let's
see<00:00:19.380> how<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.279> works<00:00:24.109> now<00:00:25.109> as<00:00:25.320> you<00:00:25.350> can<00:00:25.650> see<00:00:25.789> you

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
see how it works now as you can see you

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.000 
see how it works now as you can see you
don't<00:00:26.939> require<00:00:27.300> anything<00:00:27.810> fancy<00:00:28.500> for<00:00:28.859> this

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
don't require anything fancy for this

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.900 
don't require anything fancy for this

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
experiment all you need is a bowl of

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:41.209 
experiment all you need is a bowl of
water<00:00:36.170> some<00:00:37.170> pepper<00:00:38.540> and<00:00:40.040> the<00:00:41.040> liquid

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
water some pepper and the liquid

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.160 
water some pepper and the liquid
detergent

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.130

going to immerse my finger into the
water<00:01:27.500> and<00:01:27.860> see<00:01:28.730> what<00:01:28.940> happens<00:01:33.010> hmm<00:01:34.010> as<00:01:34.670> you

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
water and see what happens hmm as you

except that some pepper got stuck to my

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.460 
except that some pepper got stuck to my
finger<00:01:40.150> but<00:01:41.150> the<00:01:41.240> pepper<00:01:41.450> in<00:01:41.750> the<00:01:41.900> bowl<00:01:42.110> has

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
finger but the pepper in the bowl has

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.880 
finger but the pepper in the bowl has
remained<00:01:42.830> in<00:01:42.980> the<00:01:43.070> same<00:01:43.310> position<00:01:44.680> now<00:01:45.680> what

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
remained in the same position now what

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.370 
remained in the same position now what
I'm<00:01:46.040> going<00:01:46.190> to<00:01:46.280> do<00:01:46.490> next<00:01:46.670> is<00:01:47.090> that<00:01:47.990> I'm<00:01:48.170> going

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
I'm going to do next is that I'm going

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.470 
I'm going to do next is that I'm going
to<00:01:48.470> apply<00:01:49.150> some<00:01:50.150> of<00:01:50.330> the<00:01:50.690> liquid<00:01:50.870> detergent<00:01:51.710> a

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.480 
to apply some of the liquid detergent a

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.200 
to apply some of the liquid detergent a
very<00:01:53.480> tiny<00:01:53.750> amount<00:01:54.200> to<00:01:55.010> the<00:01:55.040> tip<00:01:55.370> of<00:01:55.520> my<00:01:55.580> finger

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
very tiny amount to the tip of my finger

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.800 
very tiny amount to the tip of my finger
and<00:01:57.070> I'm<00:01:58.070> going<00:01:58.430> to<00:01:58.490> inverse<00:01:58.880> my<00:01:59.180> finger<00:01:59.570> once

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
and I'm going to inverse my finger once

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.990 
and I'm going to inverse my finger once
again<00:02:01.060> into<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:02.180> water<00:02:03.400> now<00:02:04.400> let's<00:02:04.670> see<00:02:04.880> if

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
again into the water now let's see if

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.359 
again into the water now let's see if
anything<00:02:05.450> different<00:02:05.840> happens<00:02:09.040> wow<00:02:10.040> did<00:02:10.100> you

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
anything different happens wow did you

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.410 
anything different happens wow did you
see<00:02:10.459> that<00:02:10.990> the<00:02:11.990> pepper<00:02:12.200> just<00:02:12.560> spread<00:02:13.420> like

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
see that the pepper just spread like

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.820 
see that the pepper just spread like
magic<00:02:15.310> isn't<00:02:16.310> that<00:02:16.580> amazing
