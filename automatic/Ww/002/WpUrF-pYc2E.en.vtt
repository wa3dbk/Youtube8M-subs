00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
okay this video is how to change the

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.960 
okay this video is how to change the
grill<00:00:05.819> on<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.600> new<00:00:06.779> Range<00:00:07.109> Rover<00:00:07.620> Evoque<00:00:07.970> you

can get them in different color

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.200 
can get them in different color
combinations<00:00:10.620> or<00:00:10.920> maybe<00:00:11.219> a<00:00:11.309> custom<00:00:11.730> grill

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
combinations or maybe a custom grill

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.900 
combinations or maybe a custom grill
I'll<00:00:12.420> show<00:00:12.870> you<00:00:12.929> bits<00:00:13.440> on<00:00:13.650> so<00:00:13.889> so<00:00:14.700> you've<00:00:14.820> got

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
I'll show you bits on so so you've got

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.939 
I'll show you bits on so so you've got
to<00:00:15.000> lift<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.330> bottom<00:00:15.590> okay<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:16.740> then<00:00:16.830> you've

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
to lift the bottom okay and then you've

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.090 
to lift the bottom okay and then you've
got<00:00:17.070> these<00:00:17.220> four<00:00:17.480> mounting<00:00:18.480> screws<00:00:18.900> here<00:00:19.439> like

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
got these four mounting screws here like

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.460 
got these four mounting screws here like
I<00:00:20.130> sort<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.520> screw<00:00:20.880> fixing<00:00:21.689> type<00:00:21.930> thing

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
I sort of screw fixing type thing

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.380 
I sort of screw fixing type thing
so<00:00:22.920> in<00:00:23.070> theory<00:00:23.310> we<00:00:23.550> should<00:00:23.820> better<00:00:23.939> hold<00:00:24.210> the

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
so in theory we should better hold the

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.089 
so in theory we should better hold the
outside<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.199> bit<00:00:26.130> infidel<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:28.099> unscrew

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099

sort of try and push this up to relieve
that<00:02:52.140> bit<00:02:52.349> there<00:02:52.560> so<00:02:52.799> you<00:02:53.190> need<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.430> wiggle

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
that bit there so you need to wiggle

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.369 
that bit there so you need to wiggle
this<00:02:53.970> clip<00:02:54.620> to<00:02:55.620> get<00:02:55.739> that<00:02:55.920> out<00:02:56.099> and<00:02:56.280> then<00:02:56.430> that

00:02:57.369 --> 00:02:57.379 
this clip to get that out and then that

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:00.920 
this clip to get that out and then that
release<00:02:58.379> is<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.680> final<00:02:59.280> mechanism<00:02:59.910> okay<00:03:00.540> and

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
release is the final mechanism okay and

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.870 
release is the final mechanism okay and
then<00:03:01.019> you<00:03:01.560> can<00:03:01.590> see<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.010> corner<00:03:02.400> ones<00:03:02.609> are

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
then you can see the corner ones are

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.069 
then you can see the corner ones are
just<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.209> sort<00:03:03.510> of<00:03:04.489> round<00:03:05.489> end<00:03:05.970> that<00:03:06.750> dock

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
just the sort of round end that dock

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.740 
just the sort of round end that dock
into<00:03:07.620> these<00:03:07.799> clips<00:03:08.400> here<00:03:08.579> so<00:03:09.299> you've<00:03:09.420> got<00:03:09.540> one

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
into these clips here so you've got one

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.830 
into these clips here so you've got one

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
there and one there and then obviously

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.409 
there and one there and then obviously
refitting<00:03:13.650> to<00:03:13.799> reverse<00:03:14.160> it<00:03:14.790> just<00:03:15.090> push<00:03:15.269> it

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:15.419 
refitting to reverse it just push it

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:16.930 
refitting to reverse it just push it
back<00:03:15.450> on<00:03:15.840> and<00:03:16.049> I'll<00:03:16.109> show<00:03:16.319> your<00:03:16.530> do<00:03:16.650> it<00:03:16.769> now
