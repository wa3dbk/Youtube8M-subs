you want to copy if you do that it's

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.520 
you want to copy if you do that it's
probably<00:01:20.759> might<00:01:21.330> stay<00:01:21.659> that's<00:01:22.350> what<00:01:22.500> I

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
probably might stay that's what I

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.350 
probably might stay that's what I
actually<00:01:22.770> accidentally<00:01:23.490> did<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.909> my<00:01:24.060> gorillas

an<00:02:44.170> exploit<00:02:44.590> which<00:02:45.460> I<00:02:45.640> guess<00:02:45.820> you<00:02:45.970> could<00:02:46.000> get

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.280 
an exploit which I guess you could get
banned<00:02:46.630> for<00:02:46.720> but<00:02:47.620> I<00:02:47.980> i<00:02:49.080> highly<00:02:50.080> doubt<00:02:50.230> they

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
banned for but I i highly doubt they

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.990 
banned for but I i highly doubt they
will<00:02:50.800> be<00:02:50.980> in<00:02:51.070> any<00:02:51.220> one<00:02:51.340> they<00:02:51.490> didn't<00:02:51.700> in<00:02:51.820> black
