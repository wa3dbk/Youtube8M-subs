00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.519
 the doubt about a release in 2014 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.300
 they keep growing and sometimes they come 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.689

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.140

 christoffers pete has announced 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.970
 sorry but that was the easiest 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.570
 possibility for long planned 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.310
 restructuring measures away 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.130
 18 were structured 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.689

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:22.710
 who will continue to look after raceroom in the future 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.540
 So everything totally planned here 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.659
 we demonstrated driveability and we 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:32.549
 of course planned as well as the 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:35.130
 following crash rumors kitchen in the forum 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.530
 josef has a user of himself 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.360
 claims gamestop to be an employee 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.479
 at a behind closed doors 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.680
 presentation gt5 seen first 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.540
 Descriptions sound relative 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.329
 credible and if it's true what the 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.220
 good man tells there then sees it 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:52.590
 fantastic textures better the coat 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.820
 the animals better extremely high visibility 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.820
 dynamic light sources and and and and though 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.460
 there is still nothing in the press 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.890
 to see the title 4 in his 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.149
 pc version months before release already 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.979
 was announced 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.590
 and there the production of such a game 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.410
 yes, a few which take off 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.210
 the undoubted fact that in 2014 still a 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.950
 25 there would not be that 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.600
 Christmas business would be somehow 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.730
 crazy if rockstar is not 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.040
 manages to take it with you somehow 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.010
 insofar we stay excited 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.260
 sometime rumored 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.480
 releasedatum in october i believe that 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.450
 seventeenth was in conversation, however 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.550
 probably not much more 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.520
 The real question, however, is 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:43.190
 gt5 is then synonymous with the felchen 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.190
 to keep up with call of duty 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.900
 always on and we do not go without it 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.130
 a little gossip and gossip 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.950
 especially if the weekend 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.110
 interesting insight offers how much 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.750
 makes the big youtube these days 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.550
 stars already have what happened 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.190
 already elliott to former employees 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.530
 from irrational games has on his blog 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.410
 an old feud with youtube star dead 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.110
 bizkit had been dug out before year 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.660
 and a few tweets from total of the day 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.660
 seen in the kit with a 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.850
 User argued and hey said so many 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.410
 People are struggling for my attention 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.270
 do not know why I explain them now 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.490
 what i meant in this video 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.530
 have that loses terrible 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.530
 arrogant and then wrote dead 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.540
 it's pretty disgusting with that 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.490
 thing officially maybe first 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.980
 but done behind the scenes, the 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.470
 he is now publicize wrote 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.970
 pr-man of total there is a nasty e 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.980
 mail to irrational games 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.260
 in it demand among other things one 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.480
 public apology from elliott 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.340
 antl bizkit behind 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.500
 so he reports now goes 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.840
 even ken levine personally with total 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.070
 bizkit composed around the matter of 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.250
 to create a table 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.989
 he teaches his own pr department 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.880
 just then banned another one 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.300
 Talk to the whole thing too 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.890
 say 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.570
 So he had to wait until the whole time 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.440
 shut up is not anymore 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.760
 at irrational games 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.900
 We remember they were closed 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:12.300
 and unpack it all now 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.670
 not enough to report the total bizkit 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.280
 now personally in the comments 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.830
 under elliott blog entry after the 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.239
 beginning to make the rounds on the internet 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:23.130
 and said we have a god I have yes 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.220
 I did not know that with you now 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.990
 virtually muzzling 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.880
 that did not happen to him at the beginning 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.680
 believed but after the two still 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.030
 exchanged a few allegations 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.680
 at least they seem now 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:38.930
 reasonably reconciled and now 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.730
 everyone goes on with what he continues 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.020
 makes the one developed games and the one 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.020
 others are swimming in the money 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.110
 that 's it with the games da news goes into 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.850

 in the tomatoes garden under my 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:03.910
 cellar because there has the motion detector 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.910
 struck why ever because it
