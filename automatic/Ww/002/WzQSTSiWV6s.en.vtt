00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:11.279

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:15.639
 here we have the slot for Haiti headphones and the charger and also 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:17.039
 the rustic 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.449

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:22.470

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.620
 he has a hub height viewed from the front senses the system does not praise 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.249

 to switch from other clubs Player City 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.470
 depending on the players also the function 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.860
 and then I still have the Shaft Kies goals here, I think 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.980
 drove a bit small and 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.120
 also approach very close 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.800
 to the call buttons 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.140
 that means you have to be careful that you do not chill 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.070
 then we see the directional pad here 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.509

 active application linking and internet 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.810

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.110

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.110

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.320
 m Trittin 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.320
 to the right I can define a close link 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.080
 Unna unrecognizable around 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.220
 he likes or needs my contact list 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.750
 so the name kept that minimized 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.800
 105 of her texts 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.280

 Of course everyone wants to 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.590
 then I have a search function here 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.119
 the minimum certainly also pulpit stylish out of it 

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:12.809
 Let me add a little bit more 

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:18.419
 We are sorry that this has been done 

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:23.729

 Player caller organizer and setting 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.859
 and I would have to go to the news min and who will type a text message 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.939
 and have to try again 

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:58.669
 and I have to be the pressure point is a bit too soft 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:01.819
 Dancing limits are different here 

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:06.269
 stronger we told us nothing to do here is still amazing 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.339
 you do not know op has pressed 

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:09.379

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:13.979

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:16.159
 at the time of survey 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:20.419
 in order to feel in the keys agree pleasantly however Mattmann 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:21.149
 So one 

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:23.769
 despite this little one 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.769
 Emphasizing you do not really notice the difference 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.260
 Well, that's not bad, of course, but you are 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.569
 the top products 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.509
 are too soft and too uneven 

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:39.509
 And these tracks are always very sexy for me 

00:03:40.029 --> 00:03:41.199
 and this tax 

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:44.930
 It has not been so good to cross their new job 

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:46.759
 through the very hard hand
