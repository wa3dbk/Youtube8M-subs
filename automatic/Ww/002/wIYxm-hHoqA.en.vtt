00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
know this regular sitcom but it quickly

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.810 
know this regular sitcom but it quickly
morphed<00:00:49.320> into<00:00:49.940> really<00:00:50.940> an<00:00:51.210> examination<00:00:51.960> of

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
morphed into really an examination of

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.560 
morphed into really an examination of
pop<00:00:53.820> culture<00:00:54.420> through<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.870> eyes<00:00:55.050> of

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
pop culture through the eyes of

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.150 
pop culture through the eyes of
Generation<00:00:57.570> X<00:00:57.780> really<00:00:58.140> its<00:00:58.379> children<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.070> the

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
Generation X really its children of the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.610 
Generation X really its children of the
80s<00:00:59.570> trying<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.690> deal<00:01:00.930> with<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.289> fact<00:01:01.530> that

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
80s trying to deal with the fact that

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.560 
80s trying to deal with the fact that
they're<00:01:01.829> growing<00:01:02.250> up<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:03.300> exactly

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
they're growing up and that is exactly

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.240 
they're growing up and that is exactly
what<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.260> episode<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.710> about<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:04.979> think<00:01:05.189> the

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
what this episode is about I think the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.149 
what this episode is about I think the
whole<00:01:05.369> series<00:01:05.850> has<00:01:06.150> become<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.930> all<00:01:07.049> the

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
whole series has become that and all the

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.980 
whole series has become that and all the
the<00:01:08.159> meta<00:01:08.520> references<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.750> pop<00:01:09.960> culture

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
the meta references and pop culture

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.940 
the meta references and pop culture
inside<00:01:10.890> jokes<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.610> community<00:01:12.270> does<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.680> well

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
inside jokes that community does so well

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.789 
inside jokes that community does so well
they<00:01:14.909> all<00:01:15.060> come<00:01:15.270> from<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.570> specific<00:01:15.869> point<00:01:16.590> of

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
they all come from a specific point of

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.320 
they all come from a specific point of
view<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.159> point<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.549> view<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.759> very<00:01:17.790> much

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
view and that point of view is very much

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.109 
view and that point of view is very much
my<00:01:18.930> own<00:01:19.140> it's<00:01:19.500> it's<00:01:19.740> very<00:01:19.979> much<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.280> point<00:01:21.060> of

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
my own it's it's very much the point of

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.090 
my own it's it's very much the point of
view<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.600> grew<00:01:22.140> up<00:01:22.170> as<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.439> child<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:23.009> the

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
view that I grew up as a child of the

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.520 
view that I grew up as a child of the
80s<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.990> think<00:01:24.990> we're<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.200> first<00:01:25.380> generation

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
80s I think we're the first generation

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.179 
80s I think we're the first generation
that<00:01:26.430> really<00:01:27.350> our<00:01:28.350> childhood<00:01:29.009> was

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
that really our childhood was

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.600 
that really our childhood was
commoditized<00:01:29.939> more<00:01:30.750> than<00:01:30.930> any<00:01:31.170> other

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
commoditized more than any other

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.670 
commoditized more than any other
previously<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:33.689> think<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.200> we<00:01:34.380> all<00:01:34.650> have

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
previously and I think that we all have

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.069 
previously and I think that we all have
these<00:01:35.220> cultural<00:01:35.850> touchstones<00:01:36.689> if<00:01:36.960> you're

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
these cultural touchstones if you're

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.480 
these cultural touchstones if you're
like<00:01:37.259> me<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.680> grew<00:01:37.860> up<00:01:37.890> in<00:01:38.100> those<00:01:38.250> years

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
like me and you grew up in those years

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.179 
like me and you grew up in those years
and<00:01:38.720> the<00:01:39.720> 80s<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.259> 90s<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.950> have<00:01:41.100> these

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
and the 80s and 90s you have these

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.789 
and the 80s and 90s you have these
cultural<00:01:41.729> touchstones<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:43.619> really

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
cultural touchstones that that really

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.100 
cultural touchstones that that really
define<00:01:44.340> what<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.670> was<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.180> be<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.329> child<00:01:45.750> and

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
define what it was to be a child and

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.109 
define what it was to be a child and
this<00:01:46.470> episode<00:01:47.100> last<00:01:47.340> night<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.700> community
