on to the machine and it sits inside the
counterweight<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:29.159> protect<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.670> door<00:01:29.880> in

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
counterweight to protect the door in

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.749 
counterweight to protect the door in
operation<00:01:30.929> by<00:01:31.799> having<00:01:32.100> your<00:01:32.159> door<00:01:32.340> like<00:01:32.549> this

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
operation by having your door like this

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.969 
operation by having your door like this
it<00:01:32.969> gives<00:01:33.119> us<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.359> wider<00:01:33.570> opening<00:01:33.719> in<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.859> out

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
it gives us a wider opening in and out

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.099 
it gives us a wider opening in and out
of<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.310> operator<00:01:35.789> station<00:01:36.299> for<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.719> operator

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:37.109 
of the operator station for the operator

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:39.950 
of the operator station for the operator
and<00:01:37.409> then<00:01:37.950> close<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.369> door<00:01:38.570> quick<00:01:39.570> release

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
and then close the door quick release

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.950 
and then close the door quick release
and<00:01:40.280> easy<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.490> close<00:01:41.700> you'll<00:01:42.390> also<00:01:42.539> see<00:01:42.840> that

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
and easy to close you'll also see that

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.260 
and easy to close you'll also see that
we've<00:01:43.079> got<00:01:43.200> two<00:01:43.409> pieces<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:43.829> glass<00:01:44.039> flat<00:01:44.939> and

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
we've got two pieces of glass flat and

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.630 
we've got two pieces of glass flat and
so<00:01:45.929> when<00:01:46.109> the<00:01:46.229> bottom<00:01:46.560> glass<00:01:46.679> gets<00:01:47.069> damaged<00:01:47.490> on

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
so when the bottom glass gets damaged on

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.910 
so when the bottom glass gets damaged on
the<00:01:47.670> jobsite<00:01:47.969> it's<00:01:48.780> easy<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.289> replace<00:01:49.649> and

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
the jobsite it's easy to replace and

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.849 
the jobsite it's easy to replace and
very<00:01:50.369> affordable<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.030> do<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:51.499> now<00:01:52.499> let's<00:01:52.710> have

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:52.859 
very affordable to do so now let's have

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:57.020 
very affordable to do so now let's have
a<00:01:52.920> look<00:01:53.130> inside<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.789> cabin<00:01:55.609> but<00:01:56.609> start<00:01:56.880> you'll

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
a look inside the cabin but start you'll

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.609 
a look inside the cabin but start you'll
see<00:01:57.240> our<00:01:57.389> safety<00:01:57.630> lever<00:01:57.960> looks<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.289> little<00:01:58.409> bit

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
see our safety lever looks a little bit

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.050 
see our safety lever looks a little bit
different<00:01:58.740> we've<00:01:59.159> actually<00:01:59.369> changed<00:01:59.609> the

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
different we've actually changed the

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.109 
different we've actually changed the
contour<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.810> lever<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.880> more
