00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
comments on that other video and we

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.420 
comments on that other video and we
didn't<00:01:34.409> go<00:01:34.500> into<00:01:34.619> great<00:01:34.710> detail<00:01:34.979> on<00:01:35.189> how<00:01:35.369> to

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
didn't go into great detail on how to

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.249 
didn't go into great detail on how to
connect<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.909> other<00:01:35.939> end<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:36.689> that's<00:01:37.079> what<00:01:37.229> I

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
connect the other end so that's what I

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.240 
connect the other end so that's what I
want<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.530> do<00:01:37.619> here<00:01:38.689> to<00:01:39.689> show<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:40.259> little

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
want to do here to show you a little

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.580 
want to do here to show you a little
more<00:01:41.340> detailed<00:01:41.729> step-by-step<00:01:42.259> basis<00:01:43.259> on<00:01:43.530> how

more detailed step-by-step basis on how
to<00:01:43.799> do<00:01:43.979> this<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.399> hopefully<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.790> works<00:01:44.939> I

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
to do this and hopefully it works I

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.639 
to do this and hopefully it works I
don't<00:01:45.479> even<00:01:45.570> know<00:01:45.720> if<00:01:45.780> that's<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.470> actual

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
don't even know if that's the actual

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.010 
don't even know if that's the actual
issue<00:01:46.890> but<00:01:47.189> very<00:01:48.119> slim<00:01:48.390> little<00:01:48.479> similar

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
issue but very slim little similar

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.020 
issue but very slim little similar
problems<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:50.100> wanted<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.399> try<00:01:50.579> this<00:01:50.759> before

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
problems and I wanted to try this before

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.330 
problems and I wanted to try this before
I<00:01:51.090> wouldn't<00:01:51.210> spend<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.509> hundred<00:01:51.659> dollars<00:01:51.780> and

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
I wouldn't spend a hundred dollars and

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.149 
I wouldn't spend a hundred dollars and
all<00:01:53.340> day<00:01:53.520> putting<00:01:53.880> in<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.030> new<00:01:54.060> starter<00:01:54.540> so

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
all day putting in a new starter so

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.039 
all day putting in a new starter so
let's<00:01:56.159> get<00:01:56.280> started<00:01:56.670> here<00:01:56.899> I'll<00:01:57.899> be<00:01:58.020> right

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
let's get started here I'll be right

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:58.609 
let's get started here I'll be right
back

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
back

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.749 
back
show<00:01:59.399> you<00:01:59.460> how<00:01:59.549> I<00:01:59.579> got<00:01:59.759> this<00:01:59.909> sucker<00:02:00.439> connect

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
show you how I got this sucker connect

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.969 
show you how I got this sucker connect
so<00:02:02.759> we've<00:02:02.880> got<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.149> battery<00:02:03.329> disconnected<00:02:04.140> or

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
so we've got the battery disconnected or

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.219 
so we've got the battery disconnected or
I'll<00:02:05.070> take<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.430> housing<00:02:05.790> off<00:02:05.939> this<00:02:06.869> makes<00:02:07.110> it

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
I'll take the housing off this makes it

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.850 
I'll take the housing off this makes it
a<00:02:07.290> lot<00:02:07.439> easier<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.009> if<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.819> can<00:02:08.970> see

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
a lot easier and if you can see

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.380 
a lot easier and if you can see
that<00:02:11.860> racket<00:02:12.159> right<00:02:12.459> there<00:02:15.150> that's<00:02:16.150> where

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
that racket right there that's where

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.110 
that racket right there that's where
we're<00:02:16.569> connecting<00:02:16.989> that<00:02:17.080> terminal<00:02:17.530> or<00:02:17.739> that

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
we're connecting that terminal or that

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.039 
we're connecting that terminal or that
four<00:02:19.120> days<00:02:19.269> wire<00:02:19.709> I<00:02:20.709> tried<00:02:21.489> it<00:02:21.900> against<00:02:22.900> the

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
four days wire I tried it against the

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:25.770 
four days wire I tried it against the
frame<00:02:23.260> there<00:02:23.500> that<00:02:23.680> didn't<00:02:23.920> work<00:02:24.069> so<00:02:24.780> that

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
frame there that didn't work so that

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.410 
frame there that didn't work so that
bolt<00:02:26.170> right<00:02:26.409> there<00:02:26.730> was<00:02:27.730> connected<00:02:28.180> into<00:02:28.360> the

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
bolt right there was connected into the

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.460 
bolt right there was connected into the
transmission<00:02:30.510> that's<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.870> that's<00:02:32.170> where<00:02:32.349> we

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
transmission that's the that's where we

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.530 
transmission that's the that's where we
connected<00:02:33.310> it<00:02:33.400> and<00:02:33.640> I<00:02:33.760> verdict<00:02:34.030> try<00:02:34.480> to

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
connected it and I verdict try to

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:41.220 
connected it and I verdict try to
network<00:02:34.900> so<00:02:35.200> we<00:02:35.620> get<00:02:36.430> this<00:02:36.549> back<00:02:36.790> home<00:02:40.230> get

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
network so we get this back home get

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.349 
network so we get this back home get
this<00:02:41.379> back<00:02:41.590> on<00:02:41.620> and<00:02:42.840> be<00:02:43.840> right<00:02:43.989> back<00:02:44.019> with<00:02:44.319> you

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359 
this back on and be right back with you

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:49.050 
this back on and be right back with you

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
all right so as you see we got the wire

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.270 
all right so as you see we got the wire
connected<00:02:49.720> to<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.840> negative<00:02:50.079> terminal<00:02:50.319> on

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
connected to the negative terminal on

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.680 
connected to the negative terminal on
the<00:02:51.340> battery<00:02:53.819> and<00:02:54.819> you<00:02:54.879> can<00:02:55.090> kind<00:02:55.299> of<00:02:55.420> see<00:02:55.599> it

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
the battery and you can kind of see it

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.619 
the battery and you can kind of see it
down<00:02:55.840> there<00:02:56.049> connected<00:02:56.739> to<00:02:56.829> the<00:02:56.920> transmission

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
down there connected to the transmission

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:03.899 
down there connected to the transmission
so<00:02:58.629> all<00:02:58.930> set<00:02:59.200> batteries<00:02:59.560> back<00:02:59.739> in<00:03:02.760> in<00:03:03.760> this

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:03.909 
so all set batteries back in in this

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:09.690 
so all set batteries back in in this
