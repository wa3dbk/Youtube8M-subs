00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.870
 I would like to make grapes with origami 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.540
 It is a picture Well this grape is in four parts 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.790
 Made 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:17.400
 Four went made a combination of the parts 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:22.050
 So to make this one part 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.320
 It is half of a half Origami one half 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:29.230
 Than dealing with the 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.230
 In order to make this two origami 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:39.480
 Let's make it with 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:39.480
 a What I heard in half is different, but at first it is 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.239
 I feel like it's in half 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.239
 You creased 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:57.649
 I'm going to fit in the crease that I put my hands on 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.649
 I will bring four corners 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.280
 Yes , if it breaks like this I fold this in half 

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:19.939
 In s 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.870
 It's another corner 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.820
 Like this 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.140
 Fold 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:34.000
 This I Is leave creased 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.360
 And the opposite is also the same child 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.040
 Wearing the crease 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.430
 It is like this 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.750
 Of in Su is Shitara cat 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:49.270
 There is a lower corner, I think it will put it in 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.270
 I will put this corner in 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.280
 The opposite is also the same 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:59.650
 The corner 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.650
 It spreads out and puts in this 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.310
 Then it looks like this 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.520
 If so 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.620
 How was the mode 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:18.860
 Well until just is it the place of that Maa half 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.860
 The 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.620
 Please This it Is creased 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:28.049
 It's about this 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.049
 Side corner and it still hurts 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.720
 I think I will buy this much 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:41.430
 It is mated 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.430
 It is a timely menu that continues to have a further turn 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.140
 We corner of was up to the crease wearing now 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.920
 further 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.330
 Well there are 8 problems 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.170
 To wind the 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.170
 Bring 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:10.250
 And if it is ok so far, let's take the upper corner of this 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.250
 Available to you to spread under 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:18.830
 Then, it seems like this, so this central part is 8 firmly 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.830
 Please spread 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.840
 so 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.040
 See you later 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.150
 There is something to do 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.540
 Because it is all six places 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.230
 In it 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.230
 Fold 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.450
 It's a corner trio and it's already finished when it's finally 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:04:00.820
 It is in Well 3 parts after this looks like this 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.820
 Please try to make 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:10.130
 This is completed 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:16.550
 a Well, as you see, this is a good idea 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:17.120
 Is the person by was to make more small as the grain is large do is I I very Why grapes 

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:22.400
 Ne 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:24.230
 I'm using a little Now this 15 centimeters of origami but it 7.5 centimeters Toka half 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:29.240
 origami 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:33.410
 Well 4 is made of origami of the size of a quarter and this is also 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:38.960
 As it becomes net 1/4 size, is it in that case well? 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:40.020
 I'm not going to be like this unless I make 8 more numbers 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.319
 It is 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.500
 15 cm origami for easy making 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:47.480
 Also four 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:50.300
 More say if I have or buy 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:55.940
 It is one who wants to show Pooh civil engineering 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:58.060
 Please also consider increasing it is the number of Ettoko of parts origami the tiny to the pig 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:03.480
 Well it is this well 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.480
 As branch part comes to this and attaches wife 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:11.990
 It is a feeling of completion of man grape if we paste all of it 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:11.990
 Then thank you for watching until the end
