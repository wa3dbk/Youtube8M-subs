00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.089
 hello and welcome back to ls 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:09.179
 15 and this is about this one 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:11.429
 Progress hts 100 are twice 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.860
 manure barrels here, the after-sale so 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.839
 go down the floor 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.779
 okay that's not that bad once 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:23.910
 yellow once in blue I believe that 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:29.820
 the same ones are shop again 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:34.079
 look what ever this represents them 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.370
 same drama another different picture 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.030
 Strangely, it does not fit at all 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.450
 together 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.160
 although they are 66 eur 100 ps 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.969
 if required and 10,000 meters 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.750
 working width ten meters as well try 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.129
 to hang on 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.129
 get that together 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.910
 we hope that you frame with the times 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.910
 can attach 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.049
 okay maybe you want that different 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.049
 People 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:22.689
 so not sold very differently 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.689
 normal 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.240
 the degenerate sometimes mama buy new 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:34.830
 a whole old tug here 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:39.479
 and then buy again and again 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:44.640
 one this way and one again 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:52.979
 ground firmly on a new one 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:56.550
 I can try back again now 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.880
 then look okay with cow and here 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.800
 up-end kindness so the brave 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.950
 Connection is pretty angular work is going on 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.930
 and you can ride the car okay that 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.910
 works so far 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.410
 if it's really neat 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.940
 I can spray or something else, unfortunately 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.780
 do not judge exactly because I have no 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.500
 Cola have the thing, it works too 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.330
 with attach 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.810
 it's a bit strange, though 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.340
 okay, I'm curious about the lok 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.450
 completely error free so that will be synonymous 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.000
 probably in my opinion everything 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.090
 work if the very bad 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.400
 mod pretty dirty i hope that's 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.280
 washable is waiting for a no is 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.660
 not true had fun is always a pity 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.580
 actually cool again while you are still 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.850
 could do but okay I ever 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:45.410
 I am happy to start and I wish you 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.410
 have fun with the motto makes it good
