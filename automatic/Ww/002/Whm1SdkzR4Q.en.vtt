00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
melvin 17 today i'm bringing you an

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.480 
melvin 17 today i'm bringing you an
insane<00:00:14.580> I<00:00:15.000> think<00:00:15.690> it's<00:00:15.960> roughly<00:00:16.500> around<00:00:16.680> 500<00:00:17.369> k

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
insane I think it's roughly around 500 k

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.279 
insane I think it's roughly around 500 k
but<00:00:18.060> what's<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.480> point<00:00:18.660> in<00:00:18.779> giving<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:19.050> price

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
but what's the point in giving a price

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.170 
but what's the point in giving a price
on<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.250> way<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.550> market<00:00:20.850> is<00:00:20.939> it's

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
on the the way the market is it's

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.000 
on the the way the market is it's
ridiculous<00:00:21.960> so<00:00:22.109> it<00:00:22.529> could<00:00:22.710> be<00:00:22.769> a<00:00:22.830> lot<00:00:22.980> more

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
ridiculous so it could be a lot more

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.009 
ridiculous so it could be a lot more
could<00:00:23.310> be<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.460> lot<00:00:23.640> less<00:00:23.820> but<00:00:24.090> yet<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.390> think<00:00:24.930> it's

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
could be a lot less but yet I think it's

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.540 
could be a lot less but yet I think it's
around<00:00:25.109> 500<00:00:25.769> k<00:00:25.890> so<00:00:25.949> we're<00:00:26.189> going<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.400> get<00:00:26.490> into

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
around 500 k so we're going to get into

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.429 
around 500 k so we're going to get into
this<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.240> first<00:00:27.480> goalkeeper<00:00:27.720> we've<00:00:28.170> got

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
opinion than the other two but every one

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.099
