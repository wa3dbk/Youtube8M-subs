end of the model and what we have here
is<00:00:46.660> a<00:00:47.440> representation<00:00:48.280> of<00:00:48.340> a<00:00:48.430> building<00:00:48.820> a

is a representation of a building a
little<00:00:49.150> bit<00:00:49.360> like<00:00:49.740> some<00:00:50.740> of<00:00:50.860> the<00:00:50.980> warehouses

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:51.880 
little bit like some of the warehouses

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.470 
little bit like some of the warehouses
that<00:00:52.540> were<00:00:52.780> off<00:00:53.440> mostly<00:00:54.310> road<00:00:54.580> on<00:00:54.850> Trafford

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
that were off mostly road on Trafford

that were off mostly road on Trafford
Park<00:00:55.750> and<00:00:56.470> that<00:00:56.770> was<00:00:56.950> some<00:00:57.130> of<00:00:57.220> the

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
Park and that was some of the

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.880 
Park and that was some of the
inspiration<00:00:57.880> for<00:00:58.030> this<00:00:58.410> what<00:00:59.410> we've<00:00:59.590> done<00:00:59.740> is

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
inspiration for this what we've done is

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.160 
inspiration for this what we've done is
we've<00:01:00.070> made<00:01:00.280> the<00:01:00.460> actual<00:01:00.630> buildings<00:01:01.630> on<00:01:01.990> the

we've made the actual buildings on the

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.499 
we've made the actual buildings on the
baseboard<00:01:02.770> out<00:01:03.010> of<00:01:03.340> more<00:01:03.880> offcuts<00:01:04.330> at<00:01:04.420> the

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:04.509 
baseboard out of more offcuts at the

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:07.230 
baseboard out of more offcuts at the
very<00:01:04.659> thin<00:01:05.019> plywood<00:01:05.290> that<00:01:06.250> we<00:01:06.369> used<00:01:06.700> when<00:01:07.000> we

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
very thin plywood that we used when we

built baseboards but a lot of awkward
little<00:01:10.270> bits<00:01:10.420> of<00:01:10.570> this<00:01:10.659> leftover<00:01:11.200> so<00:01:11.560> we've

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
little bits of this leftover so we've

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.170 
little bits of this leftover so we've
put<00:01:11.920> them<00:01:12.009> to<00:01:12.070> good<00:01:12.220> use<00:01:12.280> cut<00:01:12.790> the<00:01:12.909> Mount

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
you don't have to build these exactly as

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.809 
you don't have to build these exactly as
per<00:01:47.170> the<00:01:47.200> kits<00:01:47.619> in<00:01:47.859> fact<00:01:48.069> it's<00:01:48.219> often<00:01:48.399> it's<00:01:48.700> a

per the kits in fact it's often it's a

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:51.719 
per the kits in fact it's often it's a
lot<00:01:48.999> better<00:01:49.240> if<00:01:49.929> you<00:01:50.350> just<00:01:50.709> experiment<00:01:51.609> a

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
lot better if you just experiment a

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.580 
lot better if you just experiment a
little<00:01:51.819> bit<00:01:51.999> and<00:01:52.299> just<00:01:52.359> adapt<00:01:52.990> them<00:01:53.259> and<00:01:53.289> hack

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
little bit and just adapt them and hack

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.830 
little bit and just adapt them and hack
them<00:01:53.799> apart<00:01:54.159> to<00:01:54.909> fit<00:01:55.240> the<00:01:55.359> space<00:01:55.539> that<00:01:55.749> you've

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
them apart to fit the space that you've

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.379 
them apart to fit the space that you've
got<00:01:56.079> now<00:01:56.679> the<00:01:57.069> bigger<00:01:57.280> piece<00:01:57.609> here<00:01:57.939> that<00:01:58.149> draws

00:01:58.379 --> 00:01:58.389 
got now the bigger piece here that draws

00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:02.550 
got now the bigger piece here that draws
the<00:01:58.630> eye<00:01:58.659> is<00:01:59.619> actually<00:02:00.130> a<00:02:00.689> b35<00:02:01.689> super<00:02:02.350> quick

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
the eye is actually a b35 super quick

you'd<00:02:08.170> actually<00:02:08.350> use<00:02:08.860> this<00:02:09.220> within<00:02:10.090> a<00:02:10.270> layout

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
you'd actually use this within a layout

we've<00:02:20.319> used<00:02:20.770> it<00:02:21.310> to<00:02:21.670> create<00:02:22.090> a<00:02:22.140> building<00:02:23.140> that

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
we've used it to create a building that

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.040 
we've used it to create a building that
supported<00:02:24.310> upon<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.910> iron<00:02:25.060> girders<00:02:25.660> torn<00:02:25.930> out

super quick terminus station kit now our
practice<00:02:43.540> apart<00:02:43.630> we<00:02:43.930> saw<00:02:44.110> a<00:02:44.140> little<00:02:44.380> bit<00:02:44.590> of

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
practice apart we saw a little bit of

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.340 
practice apart we saw a little bit of
this<00:02:44.860> in<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.340> scrap<00:02:45.610> yard<00:02:45.910> video<00:02:46.209> but<00:02:47.200> there's

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
this in the scrap yard video but there's

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.900 
this in the scrap yard video but there's
obviously<00:02:47.530> a<00:02:47.769> lot<00:02:48.069> of<00:02:48.100> other<00:02:48.340> little<00:02:48.580> bits

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
obviously a lot of other little bits

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.809 
obviously a lot of other little bits
that<00:02:49.060> were<00:02:49.269> leftover<00:02:49.690> and<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:51.220> canopy<00:02:51.610> here

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
that were leftover and the canopy here

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.300 
that were leftover and the canopy here
we've<00:02:52.090> used<00:02:52.120> as<00:02:52.600> is<00:02:52.810> to<00:02:53.080> cover<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:54.040> small

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
we've used as is to cover the small

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.729 
we've used as is to cover the small
goods<00:02:54.610> loading<00:02:55.120> platform<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:56.319> doors<00:02:56.560> that

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
you see on there they're actually from

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.620 
you see on there they're actually from
an<00:02:58.180> old<00:02:58.330> build<00:02:58.600> up<00:02:58.780> bus<00:02:59.019> engine<00:02:59.650> shed<00:02:59.980> kit<00:03:00.630> and

an old build up bus engine shed kit and

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.449 
an old build up bus engine shed kit and
this<00:03:02.230> really<00:03:02.440> goes<00:03:02.620> back<00:03:02.920> to<00:03:03.069> what<00:03:03.190> I<00:03:03.220> said

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
this really goes back to what I said

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.090 
this really goes back to what I said
about<00:03:03.900> just<00:03:04.900> salvaging<00:03:05.440> any<00:03:05.590> bits<00:03:05.830> that<00:03:05.920> you

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
about just salvaging any bits that you

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.009 
about just salvaging any bits that you
can<00:03:06.340> because<00:03:06.610> they<00:03:06.730> really<00:03:06.970> are<00:03:07.000> great<00:03:07.299> to

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
can because they really are great to

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.199 
can because they really are great to
have<00:03:08.680> that<00:03:08.860> bit<00:03:09.040> of<00:03:09.130> individuality<00:03:09.640> but<00:03:10.060> also

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
have that bit of individuality but also

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.240 
have that bit of individuality but also
stop<00:03:10.510> you<00:03:10.630> from<00:03:10.750> having<00:03:10.930> to<00:03:11.230> build<00:03:11.769> a<00:03:11.980> lot<00:03:12.130> of

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
stop you from having to build a lot of

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.240 
stop you from having to build a lot of
things<00:03:12.459> from<00:03:12.640> scratch<00:03:13.319> the<00:03:14.319> actual<00:03:15.069> platform

and to form a lot the ground surface now

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.680 
and to form a lot the ground surface now
with<00:03:25.930> this<00:03:26.109> use<00:03:26.410> thin<00:03:26.769> balsa<00:03:27.549> wood<00:03:27.730> to<00:03:28.150> bring

the sleepers of the the track itself

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.000 
the sleepers of the the track itself
then<00:03:33.790> we<00:03:33.910> can<00:03:34.060> use<00:03:34.239> the<00:03:34.420> Metcalf<00:03:34.930> cobbles<00:03:35.470> over

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
then we can use the Metcalf cobbles over

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.580 
then we can use the Metcalf cobbles over
