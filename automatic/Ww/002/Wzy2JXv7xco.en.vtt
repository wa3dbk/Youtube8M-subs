00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 good to all of us and today 28 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.940
 come and show you the different 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.470
 functions of the nodus hack that is a hack 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.540
 that minecraft is included for 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.790
 allow modifications and I'm going to 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.190
 teaching one after the other first 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.170
 place the best known of the x-raid also 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.150
 called the x- ray vision that we do 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.310
 click on the X and let us see the 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.930
 minerals that we have underground like 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.570
 you see here we have a lot of 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.039
 materials and I have been placing by 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.380
 here below so you can see what it looks like 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.140
 crazy and drunk underground through 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.480
 of the walls we can modify it to 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.210
 that different things do not come from him 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.990
 We give the and client manager x ray editor 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.180
 and we go out 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.790
 everything you can see by adding stone 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.320
 rock earth you know we can go adding 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.380
 what we want and as they go out 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.840
 well this would be the x raid here we have 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:55.110
 the next still called football that 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.570
 we click on the f and it changes completely 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.400
 the vision is as if we always had 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.740
 torches placed on all sides 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.870
 so there would never be darkness like 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.560
 you see we are totally dark click on 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.000
 the f if it does not come back lit all 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.770
 pretty effective 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.330
 well here we have the different Czechs 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.490
 for weapons as you can see by 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.860
 example you put me for the diamond with 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.740
 click on the drop attacks the middle and 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.580
 damage from the left you're here up 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.400
 controlled and I kill him if I can kill him 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:30.090
 even from behind I think 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.460
 dead be still is quite useful for 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.520
 the pvp we also have the cheto that is 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.070
 finally that when approaching an enemy 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.050
 automatic attacks I will not apply as 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.550
 you see without clicking called automatic 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:46.909
 placed automatic control to split point 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:49.670
 automatic I feel pretty 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.979
 pretty fucked for the top and also 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.079
 explains in double click pot that 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.390
 you can attack from the back plus the ford 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:58.399
 incredible field already although it is approaching you 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.789
 some already hit you from any 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.670
 part 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:04.280
 they are all the best- known landmarks of the 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.439
 weapons here we would have the different 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.750
 still construction as is the build 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:14.300
 because it is 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:16.870
 up we would also have the guild 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.870
 mod 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.599
 a couple is not a wall and the good 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.599
 flower mode 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.160
 what is there here the ground so 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.900
 It is built automatically for the 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.440
 construction this is going pretty good if 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:37.110
 you want to make walls faster 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.700
 I recommend you to finalize I am going to 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.910
 teach the nook in what we can 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.280
 activate by clicking on the button 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.230
 You see we are activated here and what block 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.660
 we want to destroy for example land 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.980
 left click and now it starts to 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.020
 destroy the earth that we 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.640
 let's approach automatically as it gives 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.010
 Moldy thanks are destroyed be but 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.460
 for example land with these with leaves 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.080
 we click and it takes away all the 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.090
 earth this because I'm with creatives and 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.400
 I would not spend the shovel that you have or the 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.620
 object that you utilicÃ©is example worth 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.650
 the earth is being removed automatically 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.300
 stones and let's click and 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.790
 automatically it is destroying what 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.680
 green what is being destroyed and this 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.470
 would pass the utility of your peak but 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.840
 this to finish holes where I wanted 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.210
 to make the house is going really well the truth 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.220
 and these are a few functions of the 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.810
 logo the nodule has many more 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.640
 functions just that I will not teach them 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.990
 everything so that it does not become too heavy 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.260
 now let's move on to how 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.370
 install them in our good minecraft 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.960
 Well, we are already in the part of 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.850
 installation of the logos now what 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.950
 we have to do is download this 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:44.700
 file that will give us this that we have 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:47.730
 here we give to extract here and ready we 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.030
 leave this folder okay we give the team 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.830
 and here we look for a version and it opens 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.740
 this folder is worth what you have to 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.260
 to do is catch this folder and 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.900
 drag it here the folder that had 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.420
 extracted you take it and the 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.189
 copies here the mind here as you see here 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.769
 I have it 1 point was scored four 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:09.870
 nodes close folders and you're going to 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:14.269
 your minecraft launcher is worth what 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.269
 we have here but let's open 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.590
 and now you give him, for example, new profile 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.980
 the directory that you have this is 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.560
 we felt and I used the version 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.320
 down below and put relay 1.6 point ago 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:35.280
 four nodes is worth me as I have 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:39.560
 here 1.412 we give to play off line 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.560
 it will take a little bit to load 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.960
 and good 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.450
 if the one who has not understood how 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.760
 to do it is simple to download it we put it 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:54.800
 on the desktop itself extract folder 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:59.270
 the folder is passed to version 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.800
 we opened launcher we chose the 1.0 point 4 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.530
 doubt it and we wait for it to open 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:07.040
 minecraft and once the minecraft opened 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.990
 we would have ready the no2 you will see 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.390
 that the node is installed because you 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.820
 will come out a poster that puts do leite that 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.600
 now you will see it 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.910
 while loading this 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.710
