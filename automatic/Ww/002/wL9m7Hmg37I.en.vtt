00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
be pretty challenging hopefully we can

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.679 
be pretty challenging hopefully we can
do<00:01:13.260> this<00:01:13.439> series<00:01:13.830> because<00:01:14.250> um<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:15.240> know<00:01:15.390> I'm

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689

do this series because um you know I'm
not<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.110> best<00:01:16.140> allocating<00:01:16.860> headshots<00:01:17.159> with

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
not the best allocating headshots with

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.969 
not the best allocating headshots with
pistols<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.720> if<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.409> doesn't<00:01:19.680> work<00:01:19.799> out

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
pistols so and if it doesn't work out

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.039 
pistols so and if it doesn't work out
then<00:01:20.040> um<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:21.090> know<00:01:21.210> I'll<00:01:21.299> just<00:01:21.330> still<00:01:21.840> do<00:01:21.930> it

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049

right into the game I think I'm gonna
play<00:01:30.540> free-for-all<00:01:31.170> just<00:01:31.350> because<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:31.770> have

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
play free-for-all just because I have

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.800 
play free-for-all just because I have
the<00:01:32.009> opportunity<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.460> get<00:01:32.549> 30<00:01:33.119> kills<00:01:33.420> and

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
the opportunity to get 30 kills and

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.060 
the opportunity to get 30 kills and
hopefully<00:01:34.229> we<00:01:34.320> can<00:01:34.409> get<00:01:34.500> headshots<00:01:34.650> in<00:01:35.009> the

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
hopefully we can get headshots in the

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.069 
hopefully we can get headshots in the
