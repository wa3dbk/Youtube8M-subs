00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.359
 hello and welcome to this news 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:08.309
 video of blocks boursier.com here maxence 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.099
 gauthier rice in this video I'm going 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.150
 explain to you the advantage of running 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.120
 in the snow 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.550
 when like today and well you 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.660
 wake up and there's plenty of snow 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.420
 everywhere and you want to make a 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.640
 climatic disadvantage an advantage for 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.990
 your progress in running 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.689
 and quite simply 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.320
 I will explain how the snow 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:37.410
 can be a benefit to you for the 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.829
 running so the advantage number 1 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.950
 if you run in the snow that's all 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.020
 simply to progress muscularly 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.690
 when you run in the snow you 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.640
 will feel that simply and well 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.829
 you sink a little bit if you have 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.690
 already ran in the sand I find myself 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.430
 personally that it looks like 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.460
 if we ran in the sand we go 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.230
 so muscularly we go much more 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.379
 worked at the thighs of the 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.020
 calves all this so naturally we 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.880
 lives a record score has the 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.580
 difficulty and suddenly by the same 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.010
 opportunity to progress the second thing 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.159
 since we have a little more trouble 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.490
 muscularly sava accustomed also our 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.450
 body to the effort to be able to have 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.270
 heartbeats 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.970
 a little stronger than usual by 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.909
 compared to an equivalent effort then 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.290
 now when we run in the snow 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.280
 there are some disadvantages 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.509
 the first is your feet if you 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.420
 run in the snow 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.909
 So you go even after 15 20 25 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.439
 minutes get hot everywhere you go 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.689
 really be good about yourself in 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.390
 your body but your feet are going to be 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.310
 wet and suddenly the only place where 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.430
 you're going to be cold it's your feet 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.790
 so if like here in this video it 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.200
 is about 5 degrees so there is no 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.030
 worries you're not going at all 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.979
 frozen feet they are just wet when 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.700
 you run but it's okay 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.969
 bearable 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.710
 on the other hand if it is less 3 - 4 - 5 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.690
 there against 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.200
 you may really have your feet 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.090
 I then have the second disadvantage of 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.730
 the snow is that the more you run 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.069
 sooner do you have that feeling of 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.069
 patinas mans or with each bounce you 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.440
 skate a bit when you run so 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.930
 it also has a little this video I wanted 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.239
 do you do today because of 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.520
 time when it snows is good we say 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.750
 I will not go running while it is 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.890
 a great way to be able so 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.920
 so allow this inconvenience 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.040
 climate to make it pass into a 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.950
 advantage is simply to be able to 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.500
 run in environments that you 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.920
 would never do and especially run in 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.050
 the snow 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.780
 it's something that's pretty fun 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:58.350
 do not do it everyday either so 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.550
 here are a little bit the benefits and 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.440
 disadvantages that I could tell you 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.890
 compared to running in the snow 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.220
 and have you ever run into the 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.280
 snow 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.340
 if so what were your feelings 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.170
 do you like it or not 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.480
 as soon as you see a bit of snow you 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:19.049
 do not run at all because everything 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.570
 it just gives you buttons etc. 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.829
 you are not well and you say I have 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.010
 better stay in my couch 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:28.079
 leave me your feedback 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.079

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:33.870

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.459
