playing<00:01:29.720> with<00:01:29.840> these<00:01:29.900> sixteenths<00:01:30.500> you're

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
playing with these sixteenths you're

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.530 
playing with these sixteenths you're
picking<00:01:31.400> down<00:01:31.580> the<00:01:31.820> number<00:01:32.090> and<00:01:32.240> down<00:01:32.360> two<00:01:32.510> and

picking down the number and down two and
up<00:01:33.020> on<00:01:33.170> the<00:01:33.260> ease<00:01:33.410> and<00:01:33.620> the<00:01:33.710> us<00:01:33.890> that's<00:01:34.190> why<00:01:34.280> you

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
up on the ease and the us that's why you

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.540 
up on the ease and the us that's why you
start<00:01:34.730> with<00:01:34.850> an<00:01:34.970> upstroke<00:01:38.950> or<00:01:39.950> without<00:01:40.310> that

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
start with an upstroke or without that

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.070 
start with an upstroke or without that
pre-bid<00:01:42.850> and<00:01:43.850> see<00:01:44.000> you<00:01:44.060> scum<00:01:44.270> it's<00:01:44.840> a<00:01:44.900> little

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
pre-bid and see you scum it's a little

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.610 
pre-bid and see you scum it's a little
slippery<00:01:45.350> or<00:01:45.530> so<00:01:46.720> I'm<00:01:47.720> just<00:01:47.840> developing<00:01:48.440> some

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
slippery or so I'm just developing some

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.860 
slippery or so I'm just developing some
variations<00:01:49.250> I<00:01:49.370> encourage<00:01:49.700> you<00:01:49.790> to<00:01:49.840> you<00:01:50.840> can

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
variations I encourage you to you can

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.109 
variations I encourage you to you can
use<00:01:51.080> slide

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
use slide

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.230 
use slide
see<00:01:53.960> I'm<00:01:54.109> bending<00:01:54.649> the<00:01:54.799> see<00:01:55.009> and<00:01:55.759> then<00:01:56.000> I<00:01:56.090> don't

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
see I'm bending the see and then I don't

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.859 
see I'm bending the see and then I don't
prebend

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
prebend

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:04.779 
prebend
to<00:01:57.679> the<00:01:57.799> D<00:01:57.979> flat<00:02:03.100> C<00:02:04.100> I'm<00:02:04.219> just<00:02:04.399> developing

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
to the D flat C I'm just developing

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:08.680 
to the D flat C I'm just developing
variations<00:02:05.390> right<00:02:05.450> there<00:02:05.810> you<00:02:06.500> could<00:02:06.649> go<00:02:07.690> as

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
variations right there you could go as

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.699 
variations right there you could go as
written<00:02:09.170> or<00:02:10.510> and<00:02:11.510> get<00:02:11.660> that<00:02:11.780> triplet<00:02:12.080> as<00:02:12.349> a<00:02:12.379> pre

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
written or and get that triplet as a pre

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.589 
written or and get that triplet as a pre
pen<00:02:13.040> release<00:02:13.700> pull<00:02:14.410> instead<00:02:15.410> of<00:02:15.500> just<00:02:15.650> pull<00:02:16.599> so

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
pen release pull instead of just pull so
