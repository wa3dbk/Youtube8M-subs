insanity that's what I look for the

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.919 
insanity that's what I look for the
music<00:00:31.880> so<00:00:32.269> it<00:00:32.390> doesn't<00:00:32.569> matter<00:00:32.719> where<00:00:32.839> you

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
personally believe that the writing

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.500 
personally believe that the writing
needs<00:00:53.780> to<00:00:53.899> mature<00:00:54.219> across<00:00:55.219> the<00:00:55.429> board<00:00:55.639> you

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
needs to mature across the board you

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.639 
needs to mature across the board you
know<00:00:56.629> because<00:00:56.899> we<00:00:57.019> have<00:00:57.139> a<00:00:57.170> lot<00:00:57.350> of<00:00:57.379> people

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
know because we have a lot of people

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.340 
know because we have a lot of people
depending<00:00:57.769> on<00:00:58.129> this<00:00:58.219> music<00:00:58.459> and<00:00:59.229> leaning<00:01:00.229> on

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
depending on this music and leaning on

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.389 
depending on this music and leaning on
it<00:01:00.379> every<00:01:00.649> single<00:01:00.829> day<00:01:00.949> to<00:01:01.069> get<00:01:01.219> them<00:01:01.369> through

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
it every single day to get them through

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:03.279 
it every single day to get them through
and<00:01:02.089> I<00:01:02.149> think<00:01:02.359> right<00:01:02.479> now<00:01:02.629> we<00:01:02.690> owe<00:01:02.989> it<00:01:03.019> to<00:01:03.170> each

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:03.289 
and I think right now we owe it to each

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:05.140 
and I think right now we owe it to each
other<00:01:03.499> to<00:01:03.649> be<00:01:03.889> as<00:01:04.040> honest<00:01:04.400> as<00:01:04.489> we<00:01:04.610> can<00:01:04.790> and<00:01:04.970> to

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
other to be as honest as we can and to

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.600 
other to be as honest as we can and to
embrace<00:01:05.470> the<00:01:06.470> growth<00:01:06.710> let's<00:01:07.250> need<00:01:07.400> about<00:01:07.550> nine

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
embrace the growth let's need about nine

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.440 
embrace the growth let's need about nine
hours<00:01:07.940> overall

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.520 

well<00:01:13.450> I<00:01:13.479> think<00:01:13.600> the<00:01:13.869> first<00:01:14.049> thing<00:01:14.200> with

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
well I think the first thing with

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.800 
well I think the first thing with
success<00:01:14.890> is<00:01:15.280> you<00:01:15.820> have<00:01:16.060> to<00:01:16.270> define<00:01:16.570> what

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
success is you have to define what

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.499 
success is you have to define what
success<00:01:16.930> is<00:01:17.170> for<00:01:17.560> you<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:19.090> is<00:01:19.270> a<00:01:19.299> new<00:01:19.479> thing

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
success is for you that is a new thing

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:23.789 
success is for you that is a new thing
and<00:01:20.020> in<00:01:20.890> this<00:01:21.070> century<00:01:22.649> rediscovering<00:01:23.649> and

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799 
and in this century rediscovering and

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:25.499 
and in this century rediscovering and
redefining<00:01:24.189> what<00:01:24.310> successes<00:01:24.759> which<00:01:25.180> I<00:01:25.329> have

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
redefining what successes which I have

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:26.730 
redefining what successes which I have
to<00:01:25.600> do<00:01:25.689> as<00:01:25.869> an<00:01:25.990> independent<00:01:26.409> artists<00:01:26.619> and<00:01:26.710> I

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
to do as an independent artists and I

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.740 
to do as an independent artists and I
think<00:01:26.920> we're<00:01:27.039> all<00:01:27.210> redefining<00:01:28.210> what<00:01:28.360> success

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
think we're all redefining what success

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.389 
think we're all redefining what success
is<00:01:28.780> it's<00:01:29.470> not<00:01:29.649> what<00:01:29.799> our<00:01:29.830> fathers<00:01:30.280> are<00:01:30.310> our

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
is it's not what our fathers are our

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:31.950 
is it's not what our fathers are our
grandfathers<00:01:30.939> or<00:01:31.030> our<00:01:31.119> mothers<00:01:31.450> but<00:01:31.630> they<00:01:31.750> did

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
grandfathers or our mothers but they did

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.749 
grandfathers or our mothers but they did
it's<00:01:32.500> about<00:01:32.710> what<00:01:32.890> really<00:01:33.070> makes<00:01:33.220> us<00:01:33.369> happy<00:01:33.640> so

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
it's about what really makes us happy so

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.990 
it's about what really makes us happy so
and<00:01:34.210> at<00:01:34.329> peace<00:01:34.539> and<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:36.009> course<00:01:36.039> we<00:01:36.310> want<00:01:36.429> to

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
and at peace and of course we want to

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.419 
and at peace and of course we want to
make<00:01:37.090> a<00:01:37.119> living<00:01:37.299> but<00:01:38.020> I<00:01:38.079> think<00:01:38.409> it's<00:01:39.159> really

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:39.429 
make a living but I think it's really

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:42.270 
make a living but I think it's really
