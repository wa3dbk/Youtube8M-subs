looking<00:00:10.679> recently<00:00:11.130> all<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.429> YouTube<00:00:11.849> cannons

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
looking recently all the YouTube cannons

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.810 
looking recently all the YouTube cannons
for<00:00:12.630> a<00:00:12.690> TNT<00:00:13.469> firing<00:00:13.980> we<00:00:14.460> think<00:00:14.610> they're<00:00:14.730> pretty

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
for a TNT firing we think they're pretty

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.779 
for a TNT firing we think they're pretty
good<00:00:15.059> we<00:00:15.870> thought<00:00:16.080> we<00:00:16.170> could<00:00:16.199> do<00:00:16.410> better<00:00:16.789> we

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
good we thought we could do better we

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.099 
good we thought we could do better we
will<00:00:17.910> plan<00:00:18.210> around<00:00:18.420> quite<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.779> bit<00:00:18.840> more<00:00:19.020> the

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
will plan around quite a bit more the

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.500 
will plan around quite a bit more the
different<00:00:19.380> designs<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:20.240> we've<00:00:21.240> come<00:00:21.390> up<00:00:21.420> with

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
different designs and we've come up with

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.660 
different designs and we've come up with
this<00:00:21.720> we<00:00:22.350> realized<00:00:22.740> after<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.189> while<00:00:23.430> that<00:00:23.460> we

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
this we realized after a while that we

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.939 
this we realized after a while that we
could<00:00:23.820> use<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.330> redstone<00:00:24.750> lamps<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.680> dangle

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
could use the redstone lamps to dangle

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.580 
could use the redstone lamps to dangle
TMT<00:00:26.699> over<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.689> top<00:00:27.930> but<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.170> would<00:00:28.260> conduct

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
TMT over the top but it would conduct

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.730 
TMT over the top but it would conduct
through<00:00:29.779> so<00:00:30.779> we've<00:00:30.900> taken<00:00:30.929> some<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.590> other

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
through so we've taken some of the other

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.130 
through so we've taken some of the other
designs<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.489> we've<00:00:33.059> incorporated<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:34.020> into

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
designs and we've incorporated it into

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.650 
designs and we've incorporated it into
this<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:35.130> entire<00:00:35.579> thing<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:36.059> made<00:00:36.510> out<00:00:36.540> of

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
this the entire thing is made out of

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.650 
this the entire thing is made out of
obsidia<00:00:37.260> just<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.620> case<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:38.100> backfire<00:00:38.660> the

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
obsidia just a case of a backfire the

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.200 
obsidia just a case of a backfire the
out<00:00:39.780> tire<00:00:40.230> outside<00:00:40.770> will<00:00:41.100> be<00:00:41.129> safe<00:00:41.430> won't

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
out tire outside will be safe won't

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.850 
out tire outside will be safe won't
break<00:00:42.480> we're<00:00:42.719> going<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:42.989> redo<00:00:43.290> anything<00:00:43.559> if<00:00:43.739> we

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
break we're going to redo anything if we

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.000 
break we're going to redo anything if we
 it<00:00:44.370> up<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:45.289> little<00:00:46.289> look<00:00:46.469> at<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.649> wiring

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
 it up a little look at the wiring

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.910 
 it up a little look at the wiring
if<00:00:47.160> people<00:00:47.520> want<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.700> try<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.059> copy<00:00:48.239> this<00:00:48.920> it's

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
if people want to try and copy this it's

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.450 
if people want to try and copy this it's
all<00:00:50.100> around<00:00:50.280> here<00:00:51.800> just<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.890> little<00:00:53.070> look<00:00:53.250> for<00:00:53.430> a

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
all around here just a little look for a

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.130 
all around here just a little look for a
second<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:54.090> may<00:00:54.210> even<00:00:54.239> better<00:00:54.539> improve<00:00:54.989> it

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
second you may even better improve it

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.799 
second you may even better improve it
I'm<00:00:55.379> sure<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.920> could<00:00:56.039> make<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.399> bigger<00:00:56.610> on<00:00:57.480> a

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
I'm sure you could make it bigger on a

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.310 
I'm sure you could make it bigger on a
much<00:00:58.050> larger<00:00:58.260> scale<00:00:59.390> the<00:01:00.390> way<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.660> works<00:01:00.899> is

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
much larger scale the way it works is

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.240 
much larger scale the way it works is
all<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.070> back<00:01:02.250> ones<00:01:02.550> at<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.420> sides<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.409> the

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
all the back ones at the sides of the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.969 
all the back ones at the sides of the
roof<00:01:05.460> all<00:01:05.700> fire<00:01:06.090> at<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.390> exact<00:01:06.750> same<00:01:06.990> time<00:01:07.290> are

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
roof all fire at the exact same time are

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.700 
roof all fire at the exact same time are
they<00:01:08.100> drop<00:01:08.340> down<00:01:08.580> into<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.820> backwater<00:01:09.560> at<00:01:10.560> the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
they drop down into the backwater at the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.460 
they drop down into the backwater at the
front<00:01:10.950> ones<00:01:11.159> here<00:01:11.460> are<00:01:12.260> powered<00:01:13.260> by<00:01:13.290> the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
front ones here are powered by the

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.560 
front ones here are powered by the
redstone<00:01:14.340> repeaters<00:01:14.729> down<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.060> side<00:01:15.299> and

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
redstone repeaters down the side and

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.520 
redstone repeaters down the side and
they<00:01:16.080> activate<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.950> bit<00:01:17.159> later

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.760 

and<00:01:20.040> it's<00:01:20.220> timed<00:01:20.580> quite<00:01:21.000> well<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.770> when

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
and it's timed quite well so when

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.350 
and it's timed quite well so when
they're<00:01:22.920> about<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.369> hit<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.610> water<00:01:23.790> they<00:01:24.119> get

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
they're about to hit the water they get

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.550 
they're about to hit the water they get

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
the pig as well we can kill is a program

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.830 
the pig as well we can kill is a program
we've<00:01:41.100> on<00:01:41.310> previous<00:01:41.790> fires<00:01:42.390> we've<00:01:42.659> actually

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
we've on previous fires we've actually

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.680 
we've on previous fires we've actually
from<00:01:43.440> here<00:01:43.649> we've<00:01:43.830> launched<00:01:44.280> TNT<00:01:44.880> past<00:01:45.299> the

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
from here we've launched TNT past the

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.520 
from here we've launched TNT past the
edge<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.080> village<00:01:46.340> it's<00:01:47.340> good<00:01:47.580> fun<00:01:48.080> and<00:01:49.080> we

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
edge of the village it's good fun and we

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.620

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
the timings you can really launched as

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.880 
the timings you can really launched as
