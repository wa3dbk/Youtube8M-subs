00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.920 

well<00:00:21.080> we<00:00:21.350> started<00:00:21.770> off<00:00:21.950> as<00:00:22.930> motorcycle

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
well we started off as motorcycle

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.040 
well we started off as motorcycle
lighting<00:00:24.290> specialists<00:00:25.100> and<00:00:25.330> the<00:00:26.330> off-road

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
lighting specialists and the off-road

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.880 
lighting specialists and the off-road
lights<00:00:27.260> became<00:00:28.420> critical<00:00:29.420> at<00:00:29.720> my<00:00:30.260> first<00:00:30.470> Baja

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
lights became critical at my first Baja

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.729 
lights became critical at my first Baja
1000<00:00:31.580> in<00:00:31.730> 1996<00:00:32.660> where<00:00:32.989> we<00:00:33.170> needed<00:00:33.350> to<00:00:33.470> come<00:00:33.710> up

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
1000 in 1996 where we needed to come up

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:35.920 
1000 in 1996 where we needed to come up
with<00:00:33.860> something<00:00:34.190> that<00:00:34.489> was<00:00:34.640> durable<00:00:35.540> and

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
with something that was durable and

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.229 
with something that was durable and
high-performance<00:00:36.739> for<00:00:37.120> racing<00:00:38.120> in<00:00:38.210> the

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
high-performance for racing in the

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.450 
high-performance for racing in the
desert<00:00:38.660> what<00:00:39.590> we<00:00:39.710> found<00:00:39.949> here<00:00:40.129> being

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
desert what we found here being

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.910 
desert what we found here being
Australia<00:00:40.970> it's<00:00:41.120> really<00:00:41.449> interesting<00:00:41.920> the

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
Australia it's really interesting the

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.650 
Australia it's really interesting the
different<00:00:43.309> terrain<00:00:43.699> the<00:00:43.970> different<00:00:44.330> types<00:00:44.510> of

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
different terrain the different types of

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:45.970 
different terrain the different types of
traveling<00:00:45.140> that<00:00:45.260> get<00:00:45.530> done<00:00:45.710> with<00:00:45.890> the

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
traveling that get done with the

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.740 
traveling that get done with the
four-wheel<00:00:46.370> drives<00:00:46.640> whether<00:00:47.480> it's<00:00:47.690> a

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
four-wheel drives whether it's a

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.900 
four-wheel drives whether it's a
technical<00:00:48.260> hill<00:00:48.470> climb<00:00:48.769> or<00:00:49.070> you're<00:00:49.460> up<00:00:49.640> in<00:00:49.820> the

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
technical hill climb or you're up in the

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.430 
technical hill climb or you're up in the
cape<00:00:50.150> or<00:00:50.420> you're<00:00:50.540> out<00:00:50.570> in<00:00:50.840> the<00:00:50.870> Simpson<00:00:51.290> Desert

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
cape or you're out in the Simpson Desert

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.560 
cape or you're out in the Simpson Desert
it's<00:00:51.830> really<00:00:52.159> different<00:00:52.460> needs<00:00:53.330> that<00:00:53.449> you

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
it's really different needs that you

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.600 
it's really different needs that you
have<00:00:53.750> whether<00:00:53.989> it's<00:00:54.229> slow<00:00:54.530> and<00:00:54.830> the<00:00:55.220> light<00:00:55.400> has

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
have whether it's slow and the light has

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.850 
have whether it's slow and the light has
to<00:00:55.790> be<00:00:55.940> broad<00:00:56.659> and<00:00:56.989> all<00:00:57.110> around<00:00:57.470> you<00:00:57.680> or

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
to be broad and all around you or

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.320 
to be broad and all around you or
whether<00:00:58.040> it's<00:00:58.280> a<00:00:58.370> high<00:00:58.519> speed<00:00:58.879> you<00:00:59.059> got<00:00:59.180> to<00:00:59.269> be

00:00:59.320 --> 00:00:59.330 
whether it's a high speed you got to be

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.990 
whether it's a high speed you got to be
able<00:00:59.449> to<00:00:59.540> see<00:00:59.750> far<00:01:00.229> up<00:01:00.409> ahead<00:01:00.580> we<00:01:01.580> do<00:01:01.790> all<00:01:01.970> our

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
able to see far up ahead we do all our

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.170 
able to see far up ahead we do all our
own<00:01:02.180> optics<00:01:02.870> so<00:01:03.140> we<00:01:03.379> basically<00:01:04.100> design<00:01:04.909> the

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
own optics so we basically design the

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.210 
own optics so we basically design the
optics<00:01:05.690> to<00:01:05.960> give<00:01:06.170> us<00:01:06.320> the<00:01:06.530> light<00:01:06.740> patterns

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
optics to give us the light patterns

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.219 
optics to give us the light patterns
that<00:01:07.370> we<00:01:07.520> want<00:01:07.729> and<00:01:07.970> we<00:01:08.090> want<00:01:08.299> a<00:01:08.390> good<00:01:08.570> blend<00:01:08.990> of

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
that we want and we want a good blend of

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.039 
that we want and we want a good blend of
lights<00:01:09.500> so<00:01:10.159> in<00:01:10.520> this<00:01:10.700> kind<00:01:10.970> of<00:01:11.030> scenario<00:01:11.210> where

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
lights so in this kind of scenario where

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.440 
lights so in this kind of scenario where
we<00:01:12.080> have<00:01:12.409> low<00:01:13.100> speed<00:01:13.400> technical<00:01:13.940> and<00:01:14.150> high

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
we have low speed technical and high

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.890 
we have low speed technical and high
speed<00:01:14.780> roads<00:01:15.170> you<00:01:15.920> need<00:01:16.130> a<00:01:16.430> good<00:01:16.970> blending<00:01:17.659> of

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
speed roads you need a good blending of

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.890 
speed roads you need a good blending of
near-field<00:01:18.770> and<00:01:19.100> distant<00:01:19.490> lighting<00:01:19.900> getting

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
near-field and distant lighting getting

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.039 
near-field and distant lighting getting
a<00:01:20.990> good<00:01:21.200> blend<00:01:21.560> and<00:01:21.890> getting<00:01:22.340> a<00:01:22.430> good<00:01:23.049> overall

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
a good blend and getting a good overall

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.679 
a good blend and getting a good overall
pattern<00:01:24.770> is<00:01:25.009> really<00:01:25.670> important<00:01:26.270> for<00:01:26.570> the

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
pattern is really important for the

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:29.440 
pattern is really important for the
driver<00:01:27.020> and<00:01:27.409> it<00:01:28.009> really<00:01:28.219> helps<00:01:28.700> them<00:01:29.090> to<00:01:29.299> be

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
driver and it really helps them to be

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.109 
driver and it really helps them to be
comfortable<00:01:29.960> at<00:01:30.289> night<00:01:30.560> and<00:01:30.909> reduces<00:01:31.909> their

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
comfortable at night and reduces their

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.420 
comfortable at night and reduces their
level<00:01:32.450> of<00:01:32.570> fatigue<00:01:32.780> all<00:01:33.619> our<00:01:33.950> lights<00:01:34.159> are

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
level of fatigue all our lights are

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.249 
level of fatigue all our lights are
isolation<00:01:35.329> mounted<00:01:35.689> in<00:01:35.780> other<00:01:35.899> words<00:01:36.079> they're

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
isolation mounted in other words they're

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:38.200 
isolation mounted in other words they're
mounted<00:01:36.619> in<00:01:36.740> rubber<00:01:36.979> so<00:01:37.340> that<00:01:37.520> it<00:01:37.640> shields<00:01:38.149> the

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
mounted in rubber so that it shields the

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.120 
mounted in rubber so that it shields the
vibration<00:01:39.020> coming<00:01:39.229> from<00:01:39.439> the<00:01:39.560> vehicle<00:01:39.710> into

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
vibration coming from the vehicle into

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.669 
vibration coming from the vehicle into
the<00:01:40.340> light<00:01:40.520> we<00:01:41.000> use<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.479> finest<00:01:41.960> you<00:01:42.590> know

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:42.679 
the light we use the finest you know

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:44.679 
the light we use the finest you know

everything to maximize durability and

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:54.819 
everything to maximize durability and
longevity<00:01:52.929> yeah<00:01:53.929> I<00:01:53.960> think<00:01:54.140> using<00:01:54.770> the

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
longevity yeah I think using the

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:57.130 
longevity yeah I think using the
products<00:01:55.399> is<00:01:55.759> what<00:01:56.060> sets<00:01:56.270> us<00:01:56.539> apart<00:01:56.749> our

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
products is what sets us apart our

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.380 
products is what sets us apart our
company<00:01:57.560> apart<00:01:57.890> from<00:01:58.159> others<00:01:58.549> our<00:01:58.789> main
