00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
with the yeah having a brain part number

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.729 
with the yeah having a brain part number
hope<00:03:24.100> gun<00:03:24.660> he<00:03:25.660> could<00:03:25.840> have<00:03:25.959> had<00:03:26.109> me<00:03:26.320> straight

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
the speed boost actually came back yeah

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.319 
the speed boost actually came back yeah
sure<00:03:34.239> sure<00:03:34.690> enough<00:03:34.930> good<00:03:35.880> never<00:03:36.880> grab<00:03:37.090> it<00:03:37.239> oh

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
just like you know it seems like a very

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.949 
just like you know it seems like a very
impossible<00:04:18.340> task<00:04:18.849> and<00:04:19.150> somehow<00:04:19.329> just<00:04:19.750> like

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
impossible task and somehow just like

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.300

that<00:04:29.440> but<00:04:29.500> of<00:04:29.710> all<00:04:29.860> maps<00:04:30.160> for<00:04:30.490> it<00:04:30.580> to<00:04:30.669> happen

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
that but of all maps for it to happen

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.640 
that but of all maps for it to happen
when<00:04:31.090> I<00:04:31.210> was<00:04:31.330> like<00:04:31.449> I'm<00:04:31.570> Haven<00:04:32.020> too<00:04:32.229> so<00:04:32.500> it's

when I was like I'm Haven too so it's

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.189 
when I was like I'm Haven too so it's
pretty<00:04:32.770> much<00:04:32.889> like<00:04:33.009> the<00:04:33.639> the<00:04:34.300> favorite<00:04:34.539> map<00:04:34.960> of

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199
