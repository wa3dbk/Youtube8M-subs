00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
well I thought it was a great routine a

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.960 
well I thought it was a great routine a
number<00:03:11.000> one<00:03:11.150> by<00:03:11.810> Toni<00:03:12.080> Melanie<00:03:12.500> and<00:03:12.820> this<00:03:13.820> is

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
number one by Toni Melanie and this is

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.190 
number one by Toni Melanie and this is
the<00:03:14.060> first<00:03:14.270> time<00:03:14.420> we've<00:03:14.600> really<00:03:14.630> been<00:03:14.990> seeing

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
the first time we've really been seeing

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.500 
the first time we've really been seeing
Mambo<00:03:15.740> done<00:03:15.980> on<00:03:16.250> the<00:03:16.400> two<00:03:16.580> which<00:03:16.790> it<00:03:16.970> is<00:03:17.240> it's

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
Mambo done on the two which it is it's

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.990 
Mambo done on the two which it is it's
another<00:03:17.870> degree<00:03:18.110> of<00:03:18.320> difficulty<00:03:19.040> too<00:03:19.670> because

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
another degree of difficulty too because

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.670 
another degree of difficulty too because
it's<00:03:20.180> so<00:03:20.330> much<00:03:20.570> easier<00:03:20.750> for<00:03:21.110> a<00:03:21.170> dancer<00:03:21.560> to

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
it's so much easier for a dancer to

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.560 
it's so much easier for a dancer to
constantly<00:03:22.220> hear<00:03:22.430> that<00:03:22.610> one<00:03:22.850> beat<00:03:23.060> they<00:03:23.420> had

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
constantly hear that one beat they had

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.540 
constantly hear that one beat they had
