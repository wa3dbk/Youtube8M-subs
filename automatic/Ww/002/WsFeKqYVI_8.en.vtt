so<00:00:01.589> I'm<00:00:01.680> going<00:00:01.829> to<00:00:01.860> try<00:00:02.040> to<00:00:02.100> illustrate<00:00:02.220> here

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
so I'm going to try to illustrate here

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:04.610 
so I'm going to try to illustrate here
are<00:00:03.179> the<00:00:03.570> issues<00:00:03.899> I've<00:00:04.049> been<00:00:04.200> encountering

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
are the issues I've been encountering

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.490 
are the issues I've been encountering
with<00:00:04.920> this<00:00:05.569> context<00:00:06.569> lens<00:00:06.839> really<00:00:07.049> beautiful

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
with this context lens really beautiful

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.549 
with this context lens really beautiful
contact<00:00:07.950> lens<00:00:08.250> which<00:00:09.050> is<00:00:10.050> slightly<00:00:10.290> out<00:00:10.440> of

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
contact lens which is slightly out of

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:17.599 
contact lens which is slightly out of
focus<00:00:11.210> and<00:00:12.210> thus<00:00:14.929> there<00:00:15.929> we<00:00:16.020> go<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:16.609> it's

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
focus and thus there we go and it's

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.359 
focus and thus there we go and it's
really<00:00:17.820> nice<00:00:18.060> meta<00:00:18.420> bones<00:00:18.720> adapter<00:00:20.750> so

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
really nice meta bones adapter so

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.009 
really nice meta bones adapter so
basically<00:00:23.369> if<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:23.970> look<00:00:24.180> at<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.420> lens<00:00:24.689> there's

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
basically if I look at the lens there's

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.689 
basically if I look at the lens there's
some<00:00:25.199> key<00:00:25.439> pieces<00:00:25.680> they're<00:00:26.039> important<00:00:26.519> here

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
some key pieces they're important here

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.089 
some key pieces they're important here
first<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:27.029> all<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.390> aperture<00:00:27.720> ring<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.320> at

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
first of all is the aperture ring and at

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.980 
first of all is the aperture ring and at
the<00:00:29.279> moment<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:30.000> aperture<00:00:30.449> ring<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.720> see<00:00:30.869> the

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
the moment the aperture ring you see the

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.900 
the moment the aperture ring you see the
registration<00:00:31.349> marked<00:00:31.859> after<00:00:32.160> ring<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.489> not

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
registration marked after ring is not

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.610 
registration marked after ring is not
lining<00:00:33.390> up<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.600> registration<00:00:33.960> mark<00:00:34.320> because

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
lining up the registration mark because

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.610 
lining up the registration mark because
it's<00:00:34.800> it's<00:00:35.550> not<00:00:35.850> located<00:00:36.570> properly<00:00:37.079> in<00:00:37.230> the

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
it's it's not located properly in the

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.130 
it's it's not located properly in the
camera<00:00:38.040> this<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.120> lock<00:00:39.329> ring<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.989> will

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
camera this is the lock ring that will

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.250 
camera this is the lock ring that will
lock<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.969> lens<00:00:41.969> onto<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.420> camera<00:00:42.840> or<00:00:42.989> in<00:00:43.110> this

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
lock the lens onto the camera or in this

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.950 
lock the lens onto the camera or in this
case<00:00:43.469> onto<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.920> adapter<00:00:44.930> looking<00:00:45.930> back<00:00:46.140> here

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
case onto the adapter looking back here

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.299 
case onto the adapter looking back here
there's<00:00:48.960> some<00:00:49.050> important<00:00:49.500> pieces<00:00:49.680> here<00:00:50.160> the

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
there's some important pieces here the

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.770 
there's some important pieces here the
most<00:00:50.489> important<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:50.910> course<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.329> this<00:00:51.449> little

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
most important of course is this little

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.500 
most important of course is this little
slot<00:00:52.140> which<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.770> slot<00:00:53.039> for<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.670> for<00:00:54.420> the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
slot which is the slot for the for the

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.420 
slot which is the slot for the for the
focus<00:00:54.930> key<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.379> will<00:00:55.500> drive<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.949> focus

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
focus key that will drive the focus

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.700 
focus key that will drive the focus
another<00:00:57.180> important<00:00:57.690> piece<00:00:57.840> right<00:00:58.289> here<00:00:58.530> and

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
another important piece right here and

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.639 
another important piece right here and
that's<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.359> little<00:01:00.600> slot<00:01:00.899> for<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.350> tab

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
that's the the little slot for the tab

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.640 
that's the the little slot for the tab
that<00:01:02.070> will<00:01:02.850> hold<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.480> camera<00:01:03.930> onto<00:01:04.229> the

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
that will hold the camera onto the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.550 
that will hold the camera onto the
adapter<00:01:04.890> when<00:01:05.309> it's<00:01:05.460> locked<00:01:05.700> on<00:01:06.560> there's

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
adapter when it's locked on there's

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.320 
adapter when it's locked on there's
actually<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.890> couple<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.340> release<00:01:08.729> pins<00:01:09.090> as

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
actually a couple of release pins as

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.179 
actually a couple of release pins as
well<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.810> if<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:10.020> push<00:01:10.290> those<00:01:10.500> release<00:01:10.799> pins<00:01:11.070> I

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
well and if I push those release pins I

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.190 
well and if I push those release pins I
can<00:01:11.340> actually<00:01:11.930> rotate<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:14.600> the<00:01:15.600> ring<00:01:15.840> and

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
can actually rotate the the the ring and

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.870 
can actually rotate the the the ring and
you<00:01:16.290> see<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.220> get<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.700> work

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
you see that and you get that to work

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.859 
you see that and you get that to work
here<00:01:18.740> and<00:01:19.740> rotate<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.729> lock<00:01:21.090> ring<00:01:21.450> if<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.689> can

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
here and rotate the lock ring if I can

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.609 
here and rotate the lock ring if I can
push<00:01:22.080> these<00:01:22.350> two<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:24.200> that's<00:01:25.200> not<00:01:25.439> working

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
push these two in that's not working

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.030 
push these two in that's not working
right<00:01:25.830> now<00:01:25.890> but<00:01:26.280> when<00:01:27.030> I<00:01:27.060> do<00:01:27.240> rotate<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.320> in<00:01:28.650> and

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
right now but when I do rotate it in and

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.140 
right now but when I do rotate it in and
I<00:01:29.189> found<00:01:29.460> another<00:01:30.229> clip<00:01:31.229> where<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.439> do<00:01:31.560> that

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
I found another clip where I do that

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.499 
I found another clip where I do that
there<00:01:33.150> we<00:01:33.240> go

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
there we go

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.499 
there we go
when<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:33.990> rotate<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.650> in<00:01:34.920> now<00:01:35.490> this<00:01:35.939> goes<00:01:36.210> all

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
when I rotate it in now this goes all

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.890 
when I rotate it in now this goes all
the<00:01:36.540> way<00:01:36.720> around<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:38.189> locks<00:01:38.400> into<00:01:38.579> place

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
the way around and it locks into place

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.539 
the way around and it locks into place
the<00:01:39.900> lock<00:01:40.140> tab<00:01:40.680> goes<00:01:41.040> into<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.400> right

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
the lock tab goes into the right

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.280 
the lock tab goes into the right
positive<00:01:42.030> lock<00:01:42.210> slot<00:01:42.600> goes<00:01:42.930> into<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.140> right

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
positive lock slot goes into the right

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.240 
positive lock slot goes into the right
position<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.920> up<00:01:44.820> here<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.299> can<00:01:45.450> see<00:01:45.689> that

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
position and up here you can see that

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.490 
position and up here you can see that
that<00:01:47.250> now<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.869> aperture<00:01:48.869> position<00:01:49.350> is

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
that now the aperture position is

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.010 
that now the aperture position is
registered<00:01:50.159> properly<00:01:50.460> with<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.570> camera<00:01:51.869> so

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
registered properly with the camera so

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.050 
registered properly with the camera so
that's<00:01:52.200> great<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.890> lens<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.460> working<00:01:53.850> fine

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
that's great so the lens is working fine

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.690 
that's great so the lens is working fine
you<00:01:54.720> release<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.229> lock<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.340> ring<00:01:56.549> or

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
you release the lock of the ring or

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.380 
you release the lock of the ring or
again<00:01:56.880> okay

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
again okay

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.280 
again okay
now<00:01:58.110> let's<00:01:58.259> look<00:01:58.350> for<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.590> second<00:01:59.009> at<00:01:59.130> the

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
now let's look for a second at the

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
now let's look for a second at the
adapter<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.189> adapter<00:02:02.869> again<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:04.049> has<00:02:04.229> the

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
adapter so the adapter again it has the

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.419 
adapter so the adapter again it has the
the<00:02:05.310> focus<00:02:05.790> key<00:02:06.479> here<00:02:06.899> that<00:02:07.469> is<00:02:07.829> driven<00:02:08.099> from

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
the focus key here that is driven from

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.520 
the focus key here that is driven from
the<00:02:08.610> from<00:02:09.179> this<00:02:09.330> outer<00:02:09.599> ring

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
the from this outer ring

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.170 
the from this outer ring
here<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.920> then<00:02:11.280> we'll<00:02:11.430> drive<00:02:11.730> into<00:02:11.970> the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
here and then we'll drive into the

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.440 
here and then we'll drive into the
little<00:02:12.420> slot<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:13.350> also<00:02:13.560> has<00:02:13.890> a<00:02:13.920> lock<00:02:14.250> tab<00:02:14.610> right

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
little slot it also has a lock tab right

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.840 
little slot it also has a lock tab right
there<00:02:15.480> in<00:02:16.050> the<00:02:16.140> lock<00:02:16.319> tab<00:02:16.620> will<00:02:17.280> line<00:02:17.550> up<00:02:17.580> with

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
there in the lock tab will line up with

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.240 
there in the lock tab will line up with
the<00:02:18.120> lock<00:02:18.330> slot<00:02:18.780> on<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.319> on<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.650> counter<00:02:20.010> on

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
the lock slot on the on the counter on

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.000 
the lock slot on the on the counter on
the<00:02:20.400> lens<00:02:20.610> and<00:02:20.940> at<00:02:21.870> which<00:02:22.020> point<00:02:22.050> I<00:02:22.590> can<00:02:22.860> then

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
the lens and at which point I can then

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.300 
the lens and at which point I can then
flick<00:02:23.280> this<00:02:23.520> over<00:02:23.850> to<00:02:24.000> lock<00:02:24.209> like<00:02:25.110> that<00:02:25.380> it

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
flick this over to lock like that it

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.010 
flick this over to lock like that it
will<00:02:26.550> lock<00:02:26.760> this<00:02:27.060> in<00:02:27.300> place<00:02:27.600> and<00:02:27.870> it<00:02:27.930> will

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
will lock this in place and it will

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.140 
will lock this in place and it will
presumably<00:02:28.440> hold<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.010> lens<00:02:29.190> in<00:02:29.400> place<00:02:29.430> it's

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
presumably hold the lens in place it's

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.760 
presumably hold the lens in place it's
okay<00:02:30.420> so<00:02:30.480> this<00:02:30.660> is<00:02:30.810> all<00:02:30.930> cool<00:02:31.260> this<00:02:31.380> is<00:02:31.560> going

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
okay so this is all cool this is going

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.760 
okay so this is all cool this is going
to<00:02:31.830> work<00:02:32.010> if<00:02:32.819> it<00:02:33.060> works<00:02:33.239> so<00:02:34.200> now<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.470> first

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
to work if it works so now the first

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.500 
to work if it works so now the first
thing<00:02:34.950> I<00:02:35.040> do<00:02:35.100> is<00:02:35.459> I<00:02:35.610> line<00:02:36.180> up<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:38.239> the<00:02:39.239> focus

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
thing I do is I line up the the focus

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.460 
thing I do is I line up the the focus
slot<00:02:40.110> with<00:02:41.069> the<00:02:41.459> little<00:02:41.700> focus<00:02:42.180> key<00:02:42.480> so<00:02:43.230> I<00:02:43.260> go

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
slot with the little focus key so I go

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.250 
slot with the little focus key so I go
ahead<00:02:43.560> and<00:02:43.800> line<00:02:44.040> those<00:02:44.340> up<00:02:44.370> or<00:02:44.850> here<00:02:45.390> and<00:02:45.600> of

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
ahead and line those up or here and of

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.140 
ahead and line those up or here and of
course<00:02:46.440> it's<00:02:46.620> not<00:02:46.739> perfectly<00:02:47.489> lined<00:02:47.700> up<00:02:47.970> so

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
course it's not perfectly lined up so

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.190 
course it's not perfectly lined up so
the<00:02:48.239> first<00:02:48.390> thing<00:02:48.540> I<00:02:48.570> have<00:02:48.660> to<00:02:48.690> do<00:02:48.810> is<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:49.019> just

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
the first thing I have to do is to just

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.410 
the first thing I have to do is to just
jiggle<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.100> focus<00:02:50.459> ring<00:02:50.640> slightly<00:02:50.940> until<00:02:51.330> it

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
jiggle the focus ring slightly until it

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.850 
jiggle the focus ring slightly until it
snaps<00:02:51.660> into<00:02:51.870> place<00:02:52.019> now<00:02:52.410> it<00:02:52.500> doesn't<00:02:52.680> happen

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
snaps into place now it doesn't happen

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.070 
snaps into place now it doesn't happen
to<00:02:53.040> place<00:02:53.220> now<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.430> keys<00:02:53.670> in<00:02:53.850> place<00:02:54.090> at<00:02:54.959> which

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
to place now the keys in place at which

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.770 
to place now the keys in place at which
point<00:02:55.410> I<00:02:55.500> can<00:02:55.650> now<00:02:55.739> rotate<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.400> lock<00:02:57.209> ring<00:02:57.510> and

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
point I can now rotate the lock ring and

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.770 
point I can now rotate the lock ring and
lock<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.950> camera<00:02:59.160> into<00:02:59.459> place<00:02:59.700> and<00:03:00.390> once<00:03:00.510> I<00:03:00.720> do

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
lock the camera into place and once I do

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.360 
lock the camera into place and once I do
I've<00:03:01.140> done<00:03:01.380> that<00:03:01.560> of<00:03:01.709> course<00:03:01.890> I<00:03:02.069> can<00:03:02.190> rotate

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
I've done that of course I can rotate

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.070 
I've done that of course I can rotate
the<00:03:02.760> aperture<00:03:03.150> ring<00:03:03.269> for<00:03:03.480> just<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.750> aperture

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
the aperture ring for just the aperture

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.220 
the aperture ring for just the aperture
but<00:03:04.800> if<00:03:04.890> I<00:03:05.010> if<00:03:05.310> I<00:03:05.430> look<00:03:05.459> here<00:03:06.150> I<00:03:06.300> won't<00:03:06.900> be<00:03:07.050> able

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
but if I if I look here I won't be able

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.949 
but if I if I look here I won't be able
to<00:03:07.350> actually<00:03:07.590> lock<00:03:08.130> it<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:08.610> locking<00:03:09.420> I<00:03:09.450> could

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
to actually lock it the locking I could

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.660 
to actually lock it the locking I could
I<00:03:10.110> could<00:03:10.260> flick<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.650> lever<00:03:10.830> lever<00:03:11.250> but<00:03:11.550> it's

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
I could flick the lever lever but it's

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.040 
I could flick the lever lever but it's
not<00:03:11.819> going<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.090> do<00:03:12.239> a<00:03:12.269> lot<00:03:12.510> let<00:03:12.750> me<00:03:12.840> see<00:03:12.930> if<00:03:12.989> I

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
not going to do a lot let me see if I

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.360 
not going to do a lot let me see if I
can<00:03:13.140> get<00:03:13.260> enough<00:03:13.440> light<00:03:13.769> in<00:03:13.800> here<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:14.190> show

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
can get enough light in here to show

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.640 
can get enough light in here to show
what's<00:03:14.549> going<00:03:14.790> on<00:03:14.910> but<00:03:15.780> what's<00:03:15.930> going<00:03:16.110> on<00:03:16.350> down

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
what's going on but what's going on down

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.330 
what's going on but what's going on down
there<00:03:16.680> is<00:03:17.280> that<00:03:18.030> if<00:03:18.180> you<00:03:18.299> look<00:03:18.570> at<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:19.260> at<00:03:20.070> the

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
there is that if you look at the at the

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.729 
there is that if you look at the at the
at<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:21.090> little<00:03:21.360> tab<00:03:21.690> and<00:03:22.079> the<00:03:22.170> little<00:03:22.380> slot

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
at the little tab and the little slot

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.850 
at the little tab and the little slot
there<00:03:23.070> about<00:03:23.880> two<00:03:24.269> millimeters<00:03:24.660> apart<00:03:25.110> let<00:03:25.769> me

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
there about two millimeters apart let me

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.650 
there about two millimeters apart let me
see<00:03:26.010> if<00:03:26.100> we<00:03:26.130> can<00:03:26.400> get<00:03:27.180> them<00:03:27.329> sort<00:03:27.510> of<00:03:27.570> the

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
see if we can get them sort of the

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.990 
see if we can get them sort of the
lights<00:03:27.930> hitting<00:03:28.170> it<00:03:28.320> just<00:03:28.560> right<00:03:28.829> and<00:03:29.100> there

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
lights hitting it just right and there

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.610 
lights hitting it just right and there
about<00:03:30.180> too<00:03:30.390> many<00:03:30.510> ways<00:03:30.720> apart<00:03:31.049> I<00:03:31.140> can't<00:03:31.380> get

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
about too many ways apart I can't get

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.180 
about too many ways apart I can't get
thus<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.579> tab<00:03:32.880> and<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.239> slot<00:03:33.600> to<00:03:34.410> line<00:03:34.680> up<00:03:34.950> and

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
thus the tab and the slot to line up and

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.920 
thus the tab and the slot to line up and
I<00:03:35.579> can't<00:03:35.820> push<00:03:36.060> any<00:03:36.180> farther<00:03:36.540> because<00:03:36.720> if<00:03:36.870> I

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
I can't push any farther because if I

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:37.970 
I can't push any farther because if I
push<00:03:37.079> me<00:03:37.230> further<00:03:37.350> I'm<00:03:37.560> going<00:03:37.680> to<00:03:37.739> start

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
push me further I'm going to start

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.830 
push me further I'm going to start
damaging<00:03:38.190> the<00:03:38.549> metal<00:03:39.150> I<00:03:39.209> mean<00:03:39.359> it<00:03:39.450> goes<00:03:39.630> it

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
damaging the metal I mean it goes it

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.420 
damaging the metal I mean it goes it
goes<00:03:39.989> to<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.290> end<00:03:40.320> and<00:03:40.590> it<00:03:40.680> stops<00:03:40.950> it's<00:03:41.190> a<00:03:41.250> hard

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
goes to the end and it stops it's a hard

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.940 
goes to the end and it stops it's a hard
stop<00:03:41.730> and<00:03:42.510> it's<00:03:42.660> not<00:03:42.840> reaching<00:03:43.260> that<00:03:43.440> so<00:03:43.920> I

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
stop and it's not reaching that so I

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.590 
stop and it's not reaching that so I
suppose<00:03:44.310> I<00:03:44.459> could<00:03:44.609> always<00:03:44.670> still<00:03:45.209> flick<00:03:45.450> this

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
suppose I could always still flick this

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.000 
suppose I could always still flick this
lock<00:03:45.840> leaver<00:03:46.109> but<00:03:46.290> it's<00:03:46.410> just<00:03:46.470> a<00:03:46.620> friction<00:03:46.829> fit

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
lock leaver but it's just a friction fit

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.240 
lock leaver but it's just a friction fit
now<00:03:47.459> it's<00:03:47.670> not<00:03:47.820> holding<00:03:48.090> it<00:03:48.269> in<00:03:48.390> place

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
now it's not holding it in place

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.080 
now it's not holding it in place
furthermore<00:03:50.250> since<00:03:50.430> it<00:03:50.549> didn't<00:03:50.790> go<00:03:50.910> all<00:03:51.060> the

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
furthermore since it didn't go all the

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.250 
furthermore since it didn't go all the
way<00:03:51.239> I<00:03:51.660> can<00:03:51.810> already<00:03:52.290> see<00:03:52.590> that<00:03:52.620> that<00:03:53.459> up<00:03:53.609> here

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
way I can already see that that up here

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.550 
way I can already see that that up here
the<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:56.040> aperture<00:03:56.609> ring<00:03:56.640> is<00:03:57.030> not<00:03:57.560> justified

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
the the aperture ring is not justified

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.930 
the the aperture ring is not justified
correctly<00:03:59.010> because<00:03:59.160> it<00:03:59.340> didn't<00:03:59.579> go<00:03:59.730> all<00:03:59.820> the

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
correctly because it didn't go all the

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.340 
correctly because it didn't go all the
way<00:03:59.970> as<00:04:00.180> it<00:04:00.299> did<00:04:00.450> when<00:04:00.600> I<00:04:00.660> did<00:04:00.900> it<00:04:01.019> manually

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
way as it did when I did it manually

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.830 
way as it did when I did it manually
earlier<00:04:01.829> now<00:04:02.730> if<00:04:02.820> I<00:04:02.880> put<00:04:03.060> this<00:04:03.090> on<00:04:03.269> a<00:04:03.329> camera<00:04:03.630> I

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
earlier now if I put this on a camera I

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.449 
earlier now if I put this on a camera I
can<00:04:03.989> take<00:04:04.170> some<00:04:04.320> nice<00:04:04.440> pictures<00:04:04.680> I<00:04:04.980> have<00:04:05.220> by

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
can take some nice pictures I have by

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.490 
can take some nice pictures I have by
holding<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:06.420> lens<00:04:06.600> at<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:06.900> same<00:04:07.079> time<00:04:07.290> as<00:04:07.410> the

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
holding the lens at the same time as the

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.289 
holding the lens at the same time as the
camera<00:04:07.829> but<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.370> whole<00:04:08.549> thing<00:04:08.730> is<00:04:08.820> very<00:04:08.970> loose

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
camera but the whole thing is very loose

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.240 
camera but the whole thing is very loose
because<00:04:09.540> the<00:04:09.780> lock<00:04:09.959> is<00:04:10.140> just<00:04:10.380> friction<00:04:10.620> it

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
because the lock is just friction it

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.770 
because the lock is just friction it
comes<00:04:11.459> right<00:04:11.670> off<00:04:11.700> the<00:04:12.090> camera<00:04:12.420> just<00:04:12.540> falls

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
comes right off the camera just falls

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.080 
comes right off the camera just falls
right<00:04:12.930> off<00:04:12.989> the<00:04:13.200> little<00:04:13.410> adapter<00:04:14.010> so<00:04:14.880> that's

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
right off the little adapter so that's

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.400 
right off the little adapter so that's
the<00:04:15.239> issue<00:04:15.390> that<00:04:15.660> I've<00:04:15.780> encountered<00:04:16.109> with

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
the issue that I've encountered with

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.830 
the issue that I've encountered with
this<00:04:16.560> adapter<00:04:17.100> and<00:04:17.340> and<00:04:17.729> again<00:04:18.329> it's<00:04:18.510> a<00:04:18.599> hard

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
this adapter and and again it's a hard

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.990 
this adapter and and again it's a hard
stop<00:04:19.200> I<00:04:19.470> rotate<00:04:20.280> the<00:04:20.430> ring<00:04:20.580> all<00:04:20.669> the<00:04:20.700> way<00:04:20.820> and

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
stop I rotate the ring all the way and

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.120 
stop I rotate the ring all the way and
it<00:04:21.090> stops<00:04:21.359> so<00:04:21.900> I<00:04:21.959> can't<00:04:22.229> push<00:04:22.409> any<00:04:22.500> farther<00:04:22.860> for

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
it stops so I can't push any farther for

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.400 
it stops so I can't push any farther for
damn

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
damn

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.640 
damn
fear<00:04:23.680> of<00:04:23.740> damaging<00:04:24.220> the<00:04:24.310> lens<00:04:24.750> but<00:04:25.750> the<00:04:25.990> even

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
fear of damaging the lens but the even

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.980 
fear of damaging the lens but the even
so<00:04:26.890> when<00:04:27.070> I<00:04:27.130> go<00:04:27.250> all<00:04:27.310> the<00:04:27.460> way<00:04:27.490> this<00:04:28.270> tab<00:04:28.660> is

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
so when I go all the way this tab is

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.870 
so when I go all the way this tab is
still<00:04:29.230> about<00:04:29.860> three<00:04:30.310> to<00:04:30.430> four<00:04:30.580> millimeters

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
still about three to four millimeters

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.750 
still about three to four millimeters
short<00:04:31.570> of<00:04:31.750> the<00:04:32.260> slot<00:04:32.650> that<00:04:33.220> it<00:04:33.310> would<00:04:33.430> have<00:04:33.610> to

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
short of the slot that it would have to

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.670 
short of the slot that it would have to
line<00:04:33.970> into<00:04:34.450> in<00:04:34.840> order<00:04:35.080> for<00:04:35.200> it<00:04:35.260> to<00:04:35.290> be<00:04:35.440> able<00:04:35.530> to

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
line into in order for it to be able to

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.250 
line into in order for it to be able to
lock<00:04:35.860> into<00:04:36.130> place
