watt<00:00:42.000> now<00:00:42.899> that's<00:00:43.500> what's<00:00:43.770> all<00:00:43.890> the

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
watt now that's what's all the

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.069 
watt now that's what's all the
specifications<00:00:44.309> now<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.120> power<00:00:45.690> supply<00:00:45.899> is

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
specifications now this power supply is

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.650 
specifications now this power supply is
having<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.440> hybrid<00:00:46.829> mode<00:00:47.070> now<00:00:47.760> what<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.270> is

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
having a hybrid mode now what that is is

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.680 
having a hybrid mode now what that is is
that<00:00:48.870> it's<00:00:49.370> it's<00:00:50.370> gonna<00:00:50.579> be<00:00:50.760> there<00:00:51.480> are<00:00:51.570> some

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
that it's it's gonna be there are some

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.540 
that it's it's gonna be there are some
benefits<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.440> first<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.280> produces

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
benefits the first is that it produces

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.939 
benefits the first is that it produces
noise<00:00:53.910> without<00:00:54.210> increasing<00:00:54.840> temperature

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
noise without increasing temperature

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.700 
noise without increasing temperature
it<00:00:56.280> extends<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.760> fan<00:00:57.059> life<00:00:57.620> reducing<00:00:58.620> the

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
it extends the fan life reducing the

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.069 
it extends the fan life reducing the
number<00:00:59.129> using<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.670> number<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.030> rotations<00:01:00.180> it

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
number using a number of rotations it

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.139 
number using a number of rotations it
does<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.530> because<00:01:01.980> when<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.760> don't<00:01:03.000> need

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
does it because when you don't need

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.260 
does it because when you don't need
anything<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.809> fan<00:01:03.989> will<00:01:04.199> not<00:01:04.320> run<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:05.400> that<00:01:06.119> is

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
anything the fan will not run so that is

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.390 
anything the fan will not run so that is
how<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.659> works<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.560> optimizes<00:01:08.010> heat

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
how it works it optimizes heat

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.730 
how it works it optimizes heat
dissipation<00:01:08.850> at<00:01:09.119> all<00:01:09.270> times<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.320> fanless

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
dissipation at all times and the fanless

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.429 
dissipation at all times and the fanless
mode<00:01:11.010> provides<00:01:11.430> unsurpassed<00:01:12.439> Southern

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
mode provides unsurpassed Southern

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.770 
mode provides unsurpassed Southern
performance<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:14.820> quite<00:01:15.060> nice<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:15.330> if<00:01:15.659> you

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
performance that is quite nice so if you

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.109 
performance that is quite nice so if you
really<00:01:16.049> care<00:01:16.200> about<00:01:16.229> sound<00:01:16.729> isolation<00:01:17.729> then

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
really care about sound isolation then

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.690 
really care about sound isolation then

six<00:03:39.170> pin<00:03:39.350> or<00:03:39.860> we<00:03:39.980> kind<00:03:40.160> of<00:03:40.220> SATA<00:03:40.400> cables<00:03:40.850> those

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
six pin or we kind of SATA cables those

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.870 
six pin or we kind of SATA cables those
are<00:03:41.810> three<00:03:41.989> SATA<00:03:42.200> cables<00:03:42.590> in<00:03:42.709> one<00:03:42.860> line<00:03:43.100> in<00:03:43.520> one

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
are three SATA cables in one line in one

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.870 
are three SATA cables in one line in one
cable<00:03:44.090> that<00:03:44.270> is<00:03:44.540> we<00:03:45.230> get<00:03:45.380> our<00:03:45.560> molex<00:03:46.400> connector

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
cable that is we get our molex connector

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.800 
cable that is we get our molex connector
