00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:07.530
 good some this but let's 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.590
 start with the study of 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:13.680
 unit 5 let's start with the 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.290
 study of the command scheme 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:21.510
 corresponds to the controller 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:23.480
 temperature with 14 1993 and that serves to 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.150
 control a computer a cold room 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.990
 explain this equipment to control a 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.990
 equipment that will consist of a compressor 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.990
 three phase 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:39.050
 through the km / 1 contact with a 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.300
 liquid solenoid valve the fan 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.850
 of the evaporator and the resistances of the 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.140
 discard 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:49.000
 then we will also have a line 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.789
 of protection that we see here that is going to 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.570
 consist of a protection module of the 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:56.040
 engine 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:59.420
 you know what goes with the rounds in measures 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.420
 in the combos of the engine 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.840
 guarantee thermal protection of 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.720
 engine against over temperatures 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.400
 overheating a pressure treatment of 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.850
 low security in the treatment of discharge of 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.080
 security and then we will perform the 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.510
 control through 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.170
 what we already know as point and down 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.170
 improved 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:27.450
 which consists of the following contacts and 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.450
 so let's get it started 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.050
 and let's see how it works first 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:37.730
 place we give to 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:40.160
 to execute we close the switch 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:44.720
 differential and theoretically the automatic and 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:46.770
 we put it in motion well we are seeing 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.009
 what 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.700
 turn on the signaling pilot of 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.700
 low 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:00.240
 in the case of what 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.670
 the camera did not have the line of the 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.780
 security as it is is closed and so 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.430
 so much gives way to functioning 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.569
 well I ask for everything we have 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.920
 here 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:15.150
 in the pilot that will indicate us 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.239
 what is 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.040
 Frost resistance connected 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:23.860
 you know that frost restrictions 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:27.160
 and forgiveness and resistance 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.690
 this the crankcase resistance you know that 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.170
 crankcase resistance 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:36.260
 Ensure that the compressor crankcase 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:39.680
 the liquids this is to perform in 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.630
 compressors that are made outdoors in 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.540
 a colder area than the rest of the 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.490
 team and so we avoid migration 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.590
 of the coolant becomes 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.560
 liquid and may damage the competitor 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.090
 well then before starting to start 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.890
 we give it a time for the 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.380
 crankcase resistance start at 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.510
 work during trying to pass that 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:03.460
 time and assuming there's refrigerant 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:08.690
 in the system with which this performance 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:11.000
 because the cool relay would work and 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.580
 then the 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.560
 compressor logically the clock that 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:19.160
 would try to liquid reflection before the 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.930
 camera and at the same time would also give way to 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.720
 fan operation 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.350
 evaporator well up here the regime of 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.340
 March 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:33.030
 what would happen if we wanted 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.489
 start the scheme of delineating well what 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.410
 first let's say the first thing he would do 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.019
 the controller would be both 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.690
 simultaneously to the order at the time 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.840
 start discarding simultaneously 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:49.730
 it would close the cool relay and at the same time 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:52.310
 would close the reverse of our technique 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:56.420
 but of course when you close the close the network 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:58.659
 skull before the compressor what 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.659
 will do 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:05.560
 accumulate all the refrigerant that had 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:08.440
 evaporated in the condenser when it 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.680
 occur the first straw deal will give way 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:14.350
 to open and therefore it will start 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.570
 the resistance of heating the battery 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.720
 of the evaporator when in the entrance 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.120
 all welders 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.060
 after the temperature in the 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.090
 Delegated batteries is sufficient 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.400
 elevated 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:31.479
 like to melt the ice 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.479
 a job 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:39.960
 explain well what we can do with the 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:43.770
 working fan we can 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.629
 use in opportunities with the 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.389
 running fan now with the 

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:52.349
 fan for once the discard 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:55.580
 ends crowned by the welders that 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:58.560
 goes in drink to the evaporator high 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:01.020
 final 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.129
 then once they finish 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.259
 communicate 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:07.530
 what happens is that there may be demand 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:10.050
 in the evaporator and we would go back again 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.849
 to the regime 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.120
 refrigeration 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:19.590
 all right 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:21.750
 what does tuna good mean better for 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.780
 avoid let's suppose there is a leak 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.220
 if there was a leak it would be working 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.850
 the short cycle 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:31.800
 thinking about inhabiting the container because 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:35.940
 due to the disposition of these 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:39.860
 serial contacts in parallel of low 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.860
 that even though 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:50.270
 and out has to 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:05.449
 if the equipment works and is leaking the 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:08.910
 price the low treatment 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:11.190
 by this we would arrive at the pressure 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:13.340
 after declared pressure of 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:16.490
 safety down line and the 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.900
 equipment would stop for safety according 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.699
 then what controls the tumbando 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.479
 let's repeat it again so that 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:23.479
 be clear 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:30.450
 well first of all let's see that no 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:32.280
 we have renteria between with refrigerante 

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:36.090
 in the compressor inspiration line 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:38.400
 linear solenoid valve and fan in 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:40.249
 functioning 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.559
 it happens that 

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:44.569
 We programmed before the arrival of the 

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:46.839
 time to sit down what would happen 

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:46.839
 would be 

00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:58.590
 it would work and the day was still running 

00:06:55.719 --> 00:06:58.590
 with the first hour 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:03.430
 recover all the refrigerant that goes 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:06.850
 accumulated on the dresser and in this 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:09.570
 moment once it has accumulated in 

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:09.570
 the condenser 

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:16.980
 when the probe detects that the battery 

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:19.320
 The evaporator is hot 

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:24.810
 ends 

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:27.170
 in the instant what we have is that if 

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:27.170
 there is demand 

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:35.060
 I would go again the net is an elephant 

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:38.969
 promote the refrigeration regime 

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:41.160
 good and that's all I hope that 

00:07:38.969 --> 00:07:44.100
 or saya 

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:46.160
 solved your doubts and we will see you in 

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:48.920
 the next 

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:53.000
 in the next thank you very much for the 

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:56.530
 attention in the professional training of 

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.530
 the hose in the principality
