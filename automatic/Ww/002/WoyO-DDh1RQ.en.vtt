department I have this little zip up

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.380 
department I have this little zip up
pencil<00:02:26.230> case<00:02:26.410> and<00:02:27.360> it<00:02:28.360> has<00:02:28.540> all<00:02:28.810> of<00:02:28.930> my

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
pencil case and it has all of my

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.210 
pencil case and it has all of my
friction<00:02:31.390> colors<00:02:31.780> which<00:02:32.080> are<00:02:32.319> a<00:02:32.680> reasonable

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
friction colors which are a reasonable

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.089 
friction colors which are a reasonable
felt<00:02:33.670> pens<00:02:33.910> and<00:02:34.299> might<00:02:34.450> have<00:02:34.630> I<00:02:34.930> think<00:02:35.769> all<00:02:36.069> of

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
felt pens and might have I think all of

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.160 
felt pens and might have I think all of
them<00:02:36.310> in<00:02:36.519> here<00:02:36.549> yeah<00:02:37.330> this<00:02:37.510> is<00:02:37.599> just<00:02:37.810> like<00:02:37.900> an

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
them in here yeah this is just like an

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.630 
them in here yeah this is just like an
oilcloth<00:02:38.530> shiny<00:02:39.370> and<00:02:39.959> bag<00:02:40.959> and<00:02:41.290> I<00:02:41.349> like

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
oilcloth shiny and bag and I like

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.339 
oilcloth shiny and bag and I like
police's<00:02:42.640> I<00:02:42.790> like<00:02:43.000> this<00:02:43.269> because<00:02:43.540> it's<00:02:44.140> hard

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
police's I like this because it's hard

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.259 
police's I like this because it's hard
to<00:02:44.440> let<00:02:44.560> drawn<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.130> will<00:02:45.280> ruin<00:02:45.489> or<00:02:45.760> rip<00:02:45.970> them

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
to let drawn the will ruin or rip them

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.330 
to let drawn the will ruin or rip them
because<00:02:46.599> they're<00:02:47.110> really<00:02:47.319> tough<00:02:47.590> and<00:02:47.890> shiny

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
because they're really tough and shiny

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.479 
because they're really tough and shiny
so<00:02:48.700> nothing<00:02:49.090> can<00:02:49.120> really<00:02:49.480> stay<00:02:49.930> in<00:02:49.989> them<00:02:50.489> next

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
so nothing can really stay in them next

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:57.870 
so nothing can really stay in them next
I<00:02:51.610> have<00:02:53.819> my<00:02:54.819> geometry<00:02:55.630> set<00:02:56.110> this<00:02:56.829> is<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.190> helix

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
I have my geometry set this is the helix

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.449 
I have my geometry set this is the helix
compact<00:02:58.540> form<00:02:59.019> we've<00:02:59.680> got<00:02:59.860> your<00:03:00.010> to<00:03:00.220> set

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.729 
squares protractor and bruna in the top
here<00:03:02.829> and<00:03:03.730> then<00:03:03.880> you've<00:03:04.060> got<00:03:04.299> the<00:03:04.840> set<00:03:05.650> of

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
here and then you've got the set of

compasses pencil rub and shop now and

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.099 
compasses pencil rub and shop now and
then<00:03:10.140> but<00:03:11.140> it<00:03:11.250> it<00:03:12.299> packed<00:03:13.299> in<00:03:13.510> really<00:03:13.750> small<00:03:13.930> so

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109 
then but it it packed in really small so

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:17.270 
then but it it packed in really small so
that<00:03:14.319> I<00:03:14.470> don't<00:03:14.560> have<00:03:14.739> to<00:03:15.010> carry<00:03:15.760> around<00:03:15.850> a<00:03:16.150> big
