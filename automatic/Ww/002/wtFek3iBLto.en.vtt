00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.819
 hello youtube friends here they talk to you and 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.799
 cobelli this time I bring you a 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.670
 top 5 of the best games of 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.650
 little machines that we all remember so much 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.509
 but before you start it made them clear 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.119
 that the order and the list of games that 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.939
 My samples are my taste but even so I know 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.570
 that will match many let's start with 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.390
 number 5 this little game was very bastard 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.460
 it was called sunset riders was for four 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.250
 controls and you had to capture the 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.680
 most wanted villains was not very difficult 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.450
 that's why I put them in number 5 but 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.520
 same was a very good game number 4 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:44.160
 this game was much better it was called 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.260
 metamorphic force the best of this game 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.629
 was that the characters became 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.000
 mythical animals and they had a very powerful 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.489
 good clear good for his time but 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.190
 he had very good rivals and he was very 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.530
 fun I recommend them a lot for 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.230
 those who like adventure 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.090
 in the third place of our podium it 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.760
 find 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.280
 the official game of the simpsons this 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.410
 game was very good and fun they fell 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.510
 very good to the fans of the simpsons 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.640
 but in the same way it was a game of 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.830
 those who do not forget when I was 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.930
 child I could not pass it but now with the 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.570
 ease to get games by 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.350
 internet I could just pass it and I liked it 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.590
 much 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:31.039
 in our second position we have 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.890
 a very good game was called wing west 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:35.780
 go today was a very toritos 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.149
 nice that on a full moon it 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.829
 bulls become cowboys game 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.049
 It has good powers and very good 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.329
 graphics for its time has also 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:47.000
 good rivals that's why I put it in the 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:49.759
 second place for the first place you 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.619
 I'm going to give the position to a friend who 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.869
 shit xd 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.880
 thanks nico in our first place 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.189
 we have a little game called three 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.369
 wonders the good thing about this game is that 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:04.159
 has three modalities of games the 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.619
 first is the most classic is a game of 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.690
 adventure is two goblins that has to 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.239
 go killing other little elves very 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.670
 funny but also at the end of each 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.990
 level they have very good opponents 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.630
 it shows that they worked hard 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.970
 the second one is simpler is the 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.250
 same pixies but this time in the 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.050
 air is equal to that of the ships and you're 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.990
 but still very good 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:33.740
 and the third part of the game is two 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:35.900
 Very fagoty bunnies by the way 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.930
 I do not like much, but I still 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.540
 you have to go killing some lizards and 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.360
 some balls xd 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.450
