00:00:00.839 --> 00:00:08.740
 we spend a lot more time in 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:11.770
 living at work than at home eating 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:15.490
 or sleep so desks are 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:19.090
 places of habitat and these 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:21.370
 places not like the repetition of the 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.460
 same theoretical actor that would be there from 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.720
 purely functional and efficient 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.180
 but as someone who has fun 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.270
 to be there someone who will work 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.670
 some and work is all the better 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.290
 that he feels comfortable comfortable with 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.290
 neighbors and that his neighbor is not 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.730
 exactly like him and that we know and 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:44.230
 that it's also seen in the way that 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:46.899
 they live in the exhibition space 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:50.050
 of cos myth we will talk about the offices to 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:52.030
 live and we'll talk about how to 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.280
 work that exists today and that 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:58.059
 nobody's watching and we're going to talk about 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:01.210
 ways to work in an office that 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:03.370
 are in the near future and maybe 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.009
 in a way that people perceive but 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:09.399
 others not so we'll start to 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.359
 likely to speak of those who 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:12.159
 work in offices then 

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:13.840
 that they are not in offices there 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.039
 discovers that finally working in 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.029
 office spaces that are not 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:18.369
 office spaces it's sometimes 

00:01:16.029 --> 00:01:20.109
 very pleasant and that the and that the 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:21.429
 furniture and that material that is 

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:22.929
 in is not automatically the same 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:24.219
 who is more diverse who is in 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:26.499
 agreement with the places that 

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:29.259
 contextualize we will work too 

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:31.959
 we will also talk about those who 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.819
 work at home and at eb there are 

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:35.319
 a lot of office equipment and this 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:38.819
 office supplies he must be there 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:40.810
 in relation in contrast in harmony or 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:44.829
 in a way 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:47.979
 very accurate in technical presence or 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:49.829
 in the dynamic presence in the space a 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.420
 inhabited and that should work 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.210
 then we will talk about the new 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.530
 spaces of all reconversions of 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.360
 offices that are not calculated at 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.720
 cm created for efficiency 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.759
 but today we recycle old 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.259
 spaces of activities that are done in 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.820
 cladding that are seven or eight meters 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.750
 top 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.979
 obviously we do not see the office there 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.810
 a way obviously we can do it 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.730
 something else at the same time and obviously 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.500
 that it's an often ideal space of 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.239
 work because it's a space of 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.250
 freedom and that only space of 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.980
 confrontation and that's a space 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.500
 fulfillment 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.930
 then we'll talk about some 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.730
 new typologies or rage sword 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.630
 after in ceilings through 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.810
 new types of lamps 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.400
 we will also talk about what can be 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.540
 pass on the free plane even when the 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.040
 even if this free plan is not 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.620
 automatically place all read 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.989
 but unlike rationality and 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.420
 we will also talk about another way of 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.820
 put the furniture and mix them and 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.760
 overlay them with milk and 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.070
 assemble that makes that finally we 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.790
 discover that humanity also exists 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:58.019
 in the offices we live in 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.019
 offices as she lives in the city
