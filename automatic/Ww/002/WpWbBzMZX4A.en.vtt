these are fifteen dollars a dish so this

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.070 
these are fifteen dollars a dish so this
seems<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:13.830> be<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:13.950> bit<00:00:14.009> more<00:00:14.130> high-end<00:00:14.429> than

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
seems to be a bit more high-end than

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.330 
seems to be a bit more high-end than
some<00:00:16.080> of<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.230> other<00:00:16.350> stuff<00:00:16.560> so<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.920> packaging

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
some of the other stuff so the packaging

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.010 
some of the other stuff so the packaging
that<00:00:17.369> these<00:00:17.580> comes<00:00:17.850> in<00:00:18.090> is<00:00:18.510> pretty<00:00:18.810> high-end

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
that these comes in is pretty high-end

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.929 
that these comes in is pretty high-end
it's<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.529> little<00:00:19.830> bit<00:00:19.949> overkill<00:00:20.340> if<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:20.609> ask<00:00:20.760> me

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
it's a little bit overkill if you ask me

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.810 
it's a little bit overkill if you ask me
but<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.270> have<00:00:21.750> no<00:00:21.900> complaints<00:00:22.050> about<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.820> the

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
but I have no complaints about it the
