00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
made out of anodized aerospace I'll

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.289 
made out of anodized aerospace I'll
medium<00:00:15.000> as<00:00:15.120> well

I<00:00:15.389> believe<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.750> al<00:00:15.990> 13<00:00:16.410> might<00:00:16.590> be<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.859> number

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
I believe the al 13 might be the number

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.000 
I believe the al 13 might be the number
4<00:00:17.960> aluminium<00:00:18.960> on<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.140> periodic<00:00:19.500> table<00:00:19.650> for

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
fingerprint UV protection and unmatched

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.459 
fingerprint UV protection and unmatched
clarity<00:00:42.120> so<00:00:42.390> this<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.719> great<00:00:42.930> for<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.200> iPhone

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
case itself in here so we'll take this

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.479 
case itself in here so we'll take this
out<00:00:48.329> first<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:48.840> even<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.379> case<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.860> made<00:00:50.190> out

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
out first so even the case is made out

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.180 
out first so even the case is made out
of<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:50.700> nice<00:00:50.969> metallic<00:00:51.420> case<00:00:52.140> again<00:00:52.890> the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
so let's just take this out here we go

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.320 
so let's just take this out here we go
so<00:01:13.229> we<00:01:13.740> could<00:01:13.920> put<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.100> back<00:01:14.369> into<00:01:14.670> there<00:01:14.850> I'm

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
so we could put a back into there I'm

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.460 
so we could put a back into there I'm
not<00:01:15.479> sure<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.659> was<00:01:15.869> supposed<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.200> come<00:01:16.320> out

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
not sure that was supposed to come out

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.960 
not sure that was supposed to come out
completely<00:01:16.590> with<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.280> this<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.700> bumper

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
completely with it so this is the bumper

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.480 
completely with it so this is the bumper
case<00:01:18.119> itself<00:01:18.420> really<00:01:19.020> nice<00:01:19.170> it's<00:01:19.439> got<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.860> nice

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
case itself really nice it's got a nice

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.100 
case itself really nice it's got a nice
rubber<00:01:20.820> lining<00:01:21.060> in<00:01:21.299> there<00:01:21.479> again<00:01:21.750> for<00:01:21.960> shot

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
rubber lining in there again for shot

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.440 
rubber lining in there again for shot
proof<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.799> black<00:01:23.070> version<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:23.670> it

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
proof this is the black version so it

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.660 
proof this is the black version so it
comes<00:01:24.659> with<00:01:24.990> this<00:01:25.110> nice<00:01:25.470> design<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.400> got<00:01:26.549> this

which week which is why there's a little
gap<00:02:39.540> there<00:02:39.570> so<00:02:39.900> that<00:02:40.050> stops<00:02:40.350> that<00:02:40.590> helps<00:02:41.340> to

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
gap there so that stops that helps to

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.370 
gap there so that stops that helps to
the<00:02:41.520> shock<00:02:41.700> absorption<00:02:42.060> so<00:02:42.480> if<00:02:42.930> you<00:02:43.110> were<00:02:43.230> to

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
the shock absorption so if you were to

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.500 
the shock absorption so if you were to
drop<00:02:43.530> that<00:02:43.680> accidentally<00:02:44.250> that<00:02:44.370> wold<00:02:44.580> come

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
drop that accidentally that wold come

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.750 
drop that accidentally that wold come
into<00:02:45.750> play<00:02:45.900> so<00:02:46.830> it's<00:02:47.010> also<00:02:47.130> go<00:02:47.310> away<00:02:47.460> bit<00:02:47.670> of

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
into play so it's also go away bit of

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.730 
into play so it's also go away bit of
lip<00:02:47.940> like<00:02:48.660> I<00:02:48.690> like<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:49.020> call<00:02:49.170> it<00:02:49.230> just<00:02:49.530> around
