your Howell 17 so he came he came to me
60<00:00:16.049> 60<00:00:16.820> okay<00:00:18.949> basically<00:00:19.949> when<00:00:20.550> you<00:00:20.580> said<00:00:20.850> when

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
60 60 okay basically when you said when

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
60 60 okay basically when you said when
you<00:00:21.029> started<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.449> program<00:00:23.090> you<00:00:24.090> were<00:00:24.240> more

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
you started the program you were more

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.779 
you started the program you were more
power<00:00:25.199> we<00:00:25.470> think<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:25.710> were<00:00:25.800> drum<00:00:26.010> at<00:00:26.340> 80<00:00:26.519> 81

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
power we think you were drum at 80 81

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.440 
power we think you were drum at 80 81
okay<00:00:27.750> but<00:00:30.740> as<00:00:31.740> far<00:00:32.009> as<00:00:32.070> when<00:00:32.969> we<00:00:33.059> started<00:00:33.360> the

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
okay but as far as when we started the

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.729 
okay but as far as when we started the
program<00:00:34.250> what<00:00:35.250> do<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.399> think<00:00:35.719> initially<00:00:36.739> was

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
program what do you think initially was

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.819 
program what do you think initially was
most<00:00:38.550> effective<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.360> or<00:00:40.290> what<00:00:40.440> your<00:00:40.590> velocity

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
most effective and or what your velocity

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.560 
most effective and or what your velocity
really<00:00:41.340> started<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.820> increase<00:00:42.180> what<00:00:42.450> do<00:00:42.510> you

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
really started to increase what do you

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.360 
really started to increase what do you
feel<00:00:42.750> like<00:00:42.780> what<00:00:43.200> was<00:00:43.379> working<00:00:43.739> what<00:00:44.070> was<00:00:44.250> the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
feel like what was working what was the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.010 
feel like what was working what was the
effect<00:00:44.579> of<00:00:44.700> things<00:00:45.000> that<00:00:45.270> menthol<00:00:45.780> Joe

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
effect of things that menthol Joe

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.450 
effect of things that menthol Joe
definitely<00:00:46.289> do<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:46.860> like<00:00:47.010> those<00:00:47.160> really

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
definitely do you like those really

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.160 
definitely do you like those really
doing<00:00:47.850> those<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.180> thought<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.539> huge

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
doing those I thought the huge

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.479 
doing those I thought the huge
difference<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:49.770> from<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.070> very<00:00:50.219> first

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
difference that from the very first

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.600 
difference that from the very first
moment<00:00:50.940> okay<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:51.899> what<00:00:52.140> like<00:00:52.620> just<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.399> tell

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
moment okay so what like just to tell

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.560 
moment okay so what like just to tell
them<00:00:53.760> is<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:53.910> are<00:00:54.030> watching<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.390> morning

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
them is that are watching this morning

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.420 
them is that are watching this morning
what<00:00:55.320> do<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.440> feel<00:00:55.620> like<00:00:55.649> what<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.070> affected

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
what do you feel like what is affected

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.170 
what do you feel like what is affected
in<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.550> metabolic<00:00:56.820> drills<00:00:57.090> because

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
in the metabolic drills because

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.150 
in the metabolic drills because
ultimately<00:00:58.140> those<00:00:58.379> men<00:00:58.590> bundles<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.100> the

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
ultimately those men bundles of the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.319 
ultimately those men bundles of the
teachers<00:00:59.430> better<00:00:59.579> mechanics<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.180> what

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
teachers better mechanics of what

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.270 
teachers better mechanics of what
mechanics<00:01:00.960> were<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.680> feel<00:01:01.859> like<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.129> were

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
mechanics were you feel like you were

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.160 
mechanics were you feel like you were
learning<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.210> we're<00:01:03.390> really<00:01:03.539> helping<00:01:03.930> I've

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
learning that we're really helping I've

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.980 
learning that we're really helping I've
stayed<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.890> lot<00:01:05.100> more<00:01:05.250> for<00:01:05.519> chrome<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.479> bunch

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
stayed a lot more for chrome and a bunch

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.080 
stayed a lot more for chrome and a bunch
of<00:01:07.110> extension<00:01:07.710> yeah<00:01:08.280> she<00:01:08.610> felt<00:01:08.850> like<00:01:08.939> those

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
of extension yeah she felt like those

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.550 
of extension yeah she felt like those
work<00:01:09.270> together<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.810> there<00:01:09.930> were<00:01:10.020> that's<00:01:10.380> what

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
work together and there were that's what

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.800 
work together and there were that's what
was<00:01:10.799> helping<00:01:11.130> additionally<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:12.299> we<00:01:12.479> would<00:01:12.600> say

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
was helping additionally so we would say

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.600 
was helping additionally so we would say
that<00:01:12.840> it's<00:01:13.799> called<00:01:14.040> your<00:01:14.189> motor<00:01:14.340> coordination

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
that it's called your motor coordination

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.370 
that it's called your motor coordination
so<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.119> motor<00:01:15.330> coordination<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:16.080> muscle

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
so the motor coordination the muscle

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.020 
so the motor coordination the muscle
memory<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.680> were<00:01:16.860> learning<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.520> Symetra

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
memory you were learning to the Symetra

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.969 
memory you were learning to the Symetra
knows<00:01:18.180> who<00:01:18.360> felt<00:01:18.570> were<00:01:18.659> helping<00:01:18.990> use<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.350> and

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
knows who felt were helping use it and

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.980 
knows who felt were helping use it and
get<00:01:20.130> velocity<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.670> then<00:01:20.790> because<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.659> really

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
get velocity and then because you really

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.530 
get velocity and then because you really
you<00:01:22.259> really<00:01:22.920> kind<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.430> started<00:01:23.909> with<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.360> met

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
you really kind of started with the met

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.510 
you really kind of started with the met
drills<00:01:24.840> wanting<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.470> just<00:01:25.680> been<00:01:26.040> most<00:01:26.280> time

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
drills wanting to just been most time

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.460 
drills wanting to just been most time
there<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:26.939> then<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.750> then<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.960> target<00:01:28.200> rose

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
there and then and then the target rose

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.679 
there and then and then the target rose
no<00:01:28.799> they<00:01:29.189> have<00:01:29.280> frozen<00:01:29.490> well<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.509> didn't

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
no they have frozen well you didn't

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.109 
no they have frozen well you didn't
really<00:01:30.930> get<00:01:31.079> into<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.610> fusion<00:01:32.610> system<00:01:32.939> on<00:01:33.060> the

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
really get into the fusion system on the

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.789 
really get into the fusion system on the
strength<00:01:33.360> conditioning<00:01:33.600> program<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.560> when

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
strength conditioning program so when

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.950 
strength conditioning program so when
like<00:01:35.100> just<00:01:35.729> in<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.880> hover<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.299> yeah<00:01:36.509> so<00:01:36.750> just

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
like just in the hover that yeah so just

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.399 
like just in the hover that yeah so just
now<00:01:37.170> listen<00:01:37.909> it's<00:01:38.909> been<00:01:39.030> about<00:01:39.210> one<00:01:39.750> or<00:01:40.350> two

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
now listen it's been about one or two

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.880 
now listen it's been about one or two
months<00:01:41.100> um<00:01:41.340> yeah<00:01:42.090> about<00:01:42.390> two<00:01:43.380> months<00:01:43.680> two

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
months um yeah about two months two

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.609 
months um yeah about two months two

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
yeah yeah and why not just lifting to

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.509 
yeah yeah and why not just lifting to
give<00:03:24.600> big<00:03:24.870> we're<00:03:25.170> lifting<00:03:25.350> explosively<00:03:26.220> we're

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
give big we're lifting explosively we're

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.370 
give big we're lifting explosively we're
doing<00:03:26.730> a<00:03:26.760> lot<00:03:26.970> of<00:03:27.120> quick<00:03:27.420> explosive<00:03:27.810> movements

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
doing a lot of quick explosive movements

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.370 
doing a lot of quick explosive movements
right<00:03:28.620> we're<00:03:29.280> also<00:03:29.489> isolating<00:03:30.299> core<00:03:30.959> we're

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
right we're also isolating core we're

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.149 
right we're also isolating core we're
doing<00:03:31.590> a<00:03:31.620> lot<00:03:31.739> of<00:03:31.769> core<00:03:32.100> strengthening

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:34.159 
doing a lot of core strengthening

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:37.910 
doing a lot of core strengthening
Gertie's<00:03:35.780> all<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:36.959> spring<00:03:37.290> flight<00:03:37.590> of<00:03:37.860> the

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
Gertie's all the spring flight of the

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.670 
Gertie's all the spring flight of the
front<00:03:38.220> row<00:03:38.519> so<00:03:40.610> if<00:03:41.610> that<00:03:41.760> gets<00:03:41.879> to<00:03:42.030> Butte<00:03:42.209> oh

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
front row so if that gets to Butte oh

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.809 
front row so if that gets to Butte oh
just<00:03:43.680> let<00:03:43.830> pull<00:03:44.040> it<00:03:44.129> all<00:03:44.220> together<00:03:44.310> so<00:03:44.670> what'd

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
just let pull it all together so what'd

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.640 
just let pull it all together so what'd
you<00:03:44.849> think<00:03:44.940> of<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.390> added<00:03:46.019> the<00:03:46.110> whole<00:03:46.230> program

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
you think of the added the whole program

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.559 
you think of the added the whole program
why<00:03:46.769> do<00:03:46.830> you<00:03:46.950> think<00:03:47.099> the<00:03:47.220> whole<00:03:47.430> program<00:03:47.879> works

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
why do you think the whole program works

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.649 
why do you think the whole program works
for<00:03:48.959> the<00:03:49.049> pitcher<00:03:49.349> I<00:03:49.560> know<00:03:49.950> we<00:03:50.519> isolated<00:03:51.299> a<00:03:51.450> lot

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:51.659 
for the pitcher I know we isolated a lot

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:53.600 
for the pitcher I know we isolated a lot
of<00:03:51.750> different<00:03:52.140> things<00:03:52.319> when<00:03:53.010> we<00:03:53.099> pull<00:03:53.310> it<00:03:53.430> all

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
of different things when we pull it all

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.280 
of different things when we pull it all
together<00:03:53.760> why<00:03:54.209> do<00:03:54.269> you<00:03:54.390> think<00:03:54.659> it's<00:03:54.840> effective

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
together why do you think it's effective

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.479 
together why do you think it's effective
just<00:03:56.220> think<00:03:56.459> just<00:03:57.000> mechanics-wise<00:03:58.489> just

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
just think just mechanics-wise just

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.330 
just think just mechanics-wise just
think<00:03:59.760> triple<00:04:00.720> extension<00:04:00.930> really<00:04:01.440> and<00:04:02.040> torque

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
think triple extension really and torque

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.910 
think triple extension really and torque
is<00:04:02.940> really<00:04:03.239> what<00:04:03.390> helped<00:04:03.780> me<00:04:03.870> come<00:04:04.620> and<00:04:04.769> throw

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
is really what helped me come and throw

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.490 
is really what helped me come and throw
or<00:04:05.420> put<00:04:06.420> out<00:04:06.569> less<00:04:06.780> pressure<00:04:07.079> on<00:04:07.200> that<00:04:07.379> elbow

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
or put out less pressure on that elbow

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.780 
or put out less pressure on that elbow
because<00:04:07.859> I<00:04:07.920> know<00:04:08.069> that<00:04:08.280> was<00:04:08.430> started<00:04:08.700> even

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
because I know that was started even

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.059 
because I know that was started even
before<00:04:08.879> I<00:04:09.180> came<00:04:09.420> to<00:04:09.569> you<00:04:09.690> yeah<00:04:10.079> and<00:04:10.290> after<00:04:10.769> the

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
before I came to you yeah and after the

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.119 
before I came to you yeah and after the
first<00:04:11.250> month<00:04:11.609> of<00:04:11.910> just<00:04:12.390> learning<00:04:12.510> basic<00:04:13.129> basic

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
first month of just learning basic basic

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.430 
first month of just learning basic basic
mechanics<00:04:14.609> it<00:04:15.209> felt<00:04:15.780> a<00:04:15.840> whole<00:04:16.049> lot<00:04:16.229> better

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
mechanics it felt a whole lot better

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.170 
mechanics it felt a whole lot better
right<00:04:17.479> and<00:04:18.479> so<00:04:18.870> don't<00:04:19.019> you<00:04:19.169> feel<00:04:19.500> though<00:04:19.799> that

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
right and so don't you feel though that

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.300 
right and so don't you feel though that
the<00:04:21.180> program<00:04:21.600> is<00:04:21.750> effective<00:04:22.109> because<00:04:22.680> how

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
the program is effective because how

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.620 
the program is effective because how
many<00:04:23.370> programs<00:04:23.910> out<00:04:24.090> there<00:04:24.240> where<00:04:24.389> you<00:04:24.419> can

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
many programs out there where you can

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.770 
many programs out there where you can
get<00:04:24.900> a<00:04:25.220> strength<00:04:26.220> conditioning<00:04:26.520> program<00:04:27.360> that

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
get a strength conditioning program that

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.430 
get a strength conditioning program that
works<00:04:28.169> with<00:04:28.350> the<00:04:28.680> flooring<00:04:29.070> program<00:04:29.430> yeah

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
works with the flooring program yeah

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.990 
works with the flooring program yeah
privacy<00:04:31.440> yeah<00:04:32.100> so<00:04:32.520> don't<00:04:32.699> you<00:04:32.760> feel<00:04:32.910> like

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
privacy yeah so don't you feel like

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.510 
privacy yeah so don't you feel like
that's<00:04:33.240> a<00:04:33.539> lot<00:04:34.139> of<00:04:34.350> to<00:04:34.500> do<00:04:34.740> with<00:04:34.919> why<00:04:35.100> it's

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
that's a lot of to do with why it's

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.340 
that's a lot of to do with why it's
effective<00:04:36.150> right<00:04:36.330> yeah<00:04:36.870> because<00:04:36.990> that's<00:04:37.199> a

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
effective right yeah because that's a

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.629 
effective right yeah because that's a
hard<00:04:37.470> thing<00:04:37.650> to<00:04:37.710> find<00:04:37.979> you<00:04:38.160> know<00:04:38.280> you<00:04:38.460> even

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
hard thing to find you know you even

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.279 
hard thing to find you know you even
when<00:04:38.820> you<00:04:38.880> get<00:04:39.000> into<00:04:39.120> college<00:04:39.300> ball<00:04:39.690> your

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:40.289 
when you get into college ball your

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:42.490 
when you get into college ball your
strength<00:04:40.560> conditioning<00:04:40.800> coach<00:04:41.370> well

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
strength conditioning coach well

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.810 
strength conditioning coach well
probably<00:04:43.500> going<00:04:43.830> to<00:04:43.950> be<00:04:44.039> a<00:04:44.070> good<00:04:44.250> coach<00:04:44.490> but<00:04:44.520> it

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
probably going to be a good coach but it

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.510 
probably going to be a good coach but it
probably<00:04:45.120> won't<00:04:45.389> know<00:04:45.570> as<00:04:45.720> much<00:04:45.960> about

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
probably won't know as much about

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.860 
probably won't know as much about
pitching<00:04:47.520> at<00:04:47.760> its<00:04:48.150> you<00:04:48.300> probably<00:04:48.570> needs<00:04:48.750> to

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
pitching at its you probably needs to

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.960 
pitching at its you probably needs to
know<00:04:49.020> that<00:04:49.050> his<00:04:49.680> programs<00:04:50.280> are<00:04:50.490> more<00:04:50.639> geared

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
know that his programs are more geared

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.029 
know that his programs are more geared
toward<00:04:51.210> just<00:04:51.360> kind<00:04:51.599> of<00:04:51.800> CrossFit<00:04:52.800> or

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 
toward just kind of CrossFit or

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:55.250 
toward just kind of CrossFit or
cross-training<00:04:53.780> overall<00:04:54.780> approach<00:04:55.200> to

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
cross-training overall approach to

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.980 
cross-training overall approach to
living<00:04:56.099> and<00:04:56.610> this<00:04:56.729> program<00:04:57.000> is<00:04:57.180> more<00:04:57.479> focused

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
living and this program is more focused

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.529 
living and this program is more focused
to<00:04:58.680> the<00:04:58.710> pitcher<00:04:59.250> and<00:04:59.430> then<00:04:59.520> it<00:04:59.700> I'm<00:05:00.180> always

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 
to the pitcher and then it I'm always

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:02.070 
to the pitcher and then it I'm always
showing<00:05:00.990> you<00:05:01.169> how<00:05:01.289> it<00:05:01.320> works

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
showing you how it works

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.499 
showing you how it works
program<00:05:02.979> that's<00:05:03.520> important<00:05:04.060> that<00:05:04.240> you<00:05:04.330> think

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:04.509
