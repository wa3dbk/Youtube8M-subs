00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
Gerudo desert I don't know why it take

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.939 
Gerudo desert I don't know why it take
so<00:00:48.610> long<00:00:48.640> to<00:00:48.910> cross<00:00:49.059> Hyrule<00:00:49.570> Field<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:50.620> come

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:50.949 
so long to cross Hyrule Field and come

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:53.460 
so long to cross Hyrule Field and come
on<00:00:51.160> this<00:00:51.460> is<00:00:51.550> crazy<00:00:52.080> they<00:00:53.080> could<00:00:53.260> have<00:00:53.350> made

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
on this is crazy they could have made

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.350 
on this is crazy they could have made
this<00:00:53.590> so<00:00:53.860> much<00:00:54.040> smaller<00:00:54.460> would<00:00:55.120> have<00:00:55.210> been<00:00:55.330> a

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
this so much smaller would have been a

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.850 
this so much smaller would have been a
much<00:00:55.420> better<00:00:56.019> game<00:00:56.110> I<00:00:56.409> don't<00:00:56.589> know<00:00:56.650> why<00:00:56.800> it

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
much better game I don't know why it

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.369 
much better game I don't know why it
takes<00:00:57.100> so<00:00:57.190> long<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:58.629> i<00:00:58.989> guess<00:00:59.019> we're<00:00:59.260> gonna

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
takes so long so i guess we're gonna

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:01.259 
takes so long so i guess we're gonna
want<00:00:59.710> to<00:00:59.800> go<00:00:59.890> to<00:00:59.949> the<00:01:00.040> Gerudo<00:01:00.339> desert<00:01:00.670> and<00:01:01.089> we

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 
want to go to the Gerudo desert and we

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:02.729 
want to go to the Gerudo desert and we
could<00:01:01.570> just<00:01:01.720> jump<00:01:01.900> over<00:01:02.049> this<00:01:02.260> fence<00:01:02.470> but

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
could just jump over this fence but

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:04.910 
could just jump over this fence but
that'd<00:01:02.860> be<00:01:02.890> way<00:01:03.220> too<00:01:03.280> easy<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:04.570> I'm<00:01:04.659> gonna<00:01:04.750> go

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
around the long way just because it

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.140 
around the long way just because it
makes<00:01:07.510> me<00:01:07.720> a<00:01:07.750> better<00:01:07.960> cell<00:01:08.320> to<00:01:08.470> player<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:10.090> I'm
