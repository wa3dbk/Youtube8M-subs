00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
that's long enough to match the seam

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.999 
that's long enough to match the seam
about<00:02:02.530> three<00:02:02.950> times

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.190 

so<00:02:09.009> I<00:02:09.039> would<00:02:09.280> say<00:02:09.490> it's<00:02:10.210> about<00:02:10.360> 15<00:02:10.840> or<00:02:10.990> 16

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
so I would say it's about 15 or 16

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.630 
so I would say it's about 15 or 16
inches<00:02:11.890> of<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.220> thread<00:02:12.250> right<00:02:12.640> there<00:02:14.640> you

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
inches of the thread right there you

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.490 
inches of the thread right there you
also<00:02:15.850> may<00:02:16.150> find<00:02:16.480> that<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:16.780> piece<00:02:17.020> of<00:02:17.170> corrugated

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
also may find that a piece of corrugated

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.980 
also may find that a piece of corrugated
cardboard<00:02:18.070> is<00:02:18.370> useful<00:02:18.730> for<00:02:18.880> making<00:02:19.240> this<00:02:19.390> task

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
cardboard is useful for making this task

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.560 
cardboard is useful for making this task
easy<00:02:20.380> you're<00:02:21.310> gonna<00:02:21.370> set<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:21.850> cardboard<00:02:22.360> on

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
easy you're gonna set the cardboard on

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.660 
easy you're gonna set the cardboard on
the<00:02:22.630> table<00:02:23.140> and<00:02:23.320> you're<00:02:23.800> going<00:02:23.980> to<00:02:24.070> lay<00:02:24.280> your

you're going to take your awl and you're
going<00:02:34.660> to<00:02:34.720> punch<00:02:34.990> holes<00:02:35.380> right<00:02:36.370> directly<00:02:36.850> into

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
going to punch holes right directly into

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.570 
going to punch holes right directly into
the<00:02:37.330> crease<00:02:37.709> you're<00:02:38.709> going<00:02:38.830> to<00:02:38.890> do<00:02:39.010> two<00:02:39.280> holes

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
the crease you're going to do two holes

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.640 
the crease you're going to do two holes
that<00:02:40.480> are<00:02:40.600> going<00:02:40.750> in<00:02:40.989> direction<00:02:41.110> from<00:02:41.530> the

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
that are going in direction from the

that are going in direction from the
inside<00:02:42.040> towards<00:02:42.580> the<00:02:42.880> outside<00:02:43.530> so<00:02:44.530> do<00:02:44.709> one

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
inside towards the outside so do one

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.100 
inside towards the outside so do one
about<00:02:45.070> an<00:02:45.280> inch<00:02:45.489> down<00:02:45.760> from<00:02:45.820> the<00:02:46.060> top<00:02:46.150> just

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
about an inch down from the top just

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.050 
about an inch down from the top just
punch<00:02:47.350> a<00:02:47.470> hole<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:48.190> then<00:02:48.370> twist<00:02:48.610> it<00:02:48.700> around<00:02:48.940> a

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
punch a hole and then twist it around a

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.760 
punch a hole and then twist it around a
little<00:02:49.180> bit<00:02:49.330> you<00:02:50.050> can<00:02:50.200> see<00:02:50.230> that<00:02:50.500> we're<00:02:50.590> just

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
little bit you can see that we're just

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.290 
little bit you can see that we're just
twisting<00:02:51.100> that<00:02:51.190> a<00:02:51.250> bit<00:02:51.520> to<00:02:51.730> widen<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.180> hole

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
twisting that a bit to widen the hole

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.449 
twisting that a bit to widen the hole
it'll<00:02:52.600> make<00:02:52.750> that<00:02:52.870> threading<00:02:53.320> easier<00:02:53.620> and<00:02:53.860> you

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
it'll make that threading easier and you

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:55.830 
it'll make that threading easier and you
want<00:02:54.610> another<00:02:54.820> hole<00:02:55.060> about<00:02:55.420> an<00:02:55.540> inch<00:02:55.690> above

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
want another hole about an inch above

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.449 
want another hole about an inch above
the<00:02:55.989> bottom<00:02:56.380> going<00:02:56.650> from<00:02:56.800> the<00:02:56.890> inside<00:02:57.220> to<00:02:57.370> the

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
the bottom going from the inside to the

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.390 
the bottom going from the inside to the
outside<00:02:57.660> punch<00:02:58.660> the<00:02:58.840> hole<00:02:59.019> we<00:02:59.920> go<00:03:00.100> they<00:03:00.220> all

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
outside punch the hole we go they all

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.479 
outside punch the hole we go they all
just<00:03:00.700> to<00:03:00.790> widen<00:03:01.000> it<00:03:01.209> and<00:03:02.200> then<00:03:02.920> go<00:03:03.070> ahead<00:03:03.190> and

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
just to widen it and then go ahead and

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.110 
just to widen it and then go ahead and
flip<00:03:03.910> your<00:03:04.120> wrapper<00:03:04.510> over<00:03:05.610> doing<00:03:06.610> the<00:03:06.790> holes

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
flip your wrapper over doing the holes

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.610 
flip your wrapper over doing the holes
in<00:03:07.360> this<00:03:07.450> direction<00:03:07.989> will<00:03:08.140> help<00:03:08.320> when<00:03:08.500> you're

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
in this direction will help when you're

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.960 
in this direction will help when you're
threading<00:03:08.890> your<00:03:09.040> thread<00:03:09.340> through<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:09.790> holes

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
threading your thread through the holes

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.370 
threading your thread through the holes
because<00:03:10.239> the<00:03:10.510> thread<00:03:10.690> will<00:03:10.810> be<00:03:10.930> threading<00:03:11.230> in

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
because the thread will be threading in

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.699 
because the thread will be threading in
the<00:03:11.530> direction<00:03:11.799> that<00:03:12.130> you<00:03:12.610> punched<00:03:12.790> them<00:03:13.709> so

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
the direction that you punched them so

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:15.720 
the direction that you punched them so
now<00:03:14.830> you're<00:03:14.980> going<00:03:15.160> to<00:03:15.250> go<00:03:15.340> right<00:03:15.580> directly

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
now you're going to go right directly

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.479 
now you're going to go right directly
between<00:03:16.390> those<00:03:16.630> other<00:03:16.870> two<00:03:17.230> perforations<00:03:18.100> and

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
between those other two perforations and

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.580 
between those other two perforations and

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
from the outside towards the inside make

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.550 
from the outside towards the inside make
one<00:03:21.100> last<00:03:21.310> hole<00:03:21.780> and<00:03:22.780> again<00:03:23.019> we<00:03:23.230> go<00:03:23.380> that

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
one last hole and again we go that

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.350 
one last hole and again we go that
around<00:03:24.600> to<00:03:25.600> widen<00:03:25.930> the<00:03:25.989> hole<00:03:27.120> go<00:03:28.120> ahead<00:03:28.269> and

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
around to widen the hole go ahead and

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.819 
around to widen the hole go ahead and
flip<00:03:28.570> that<00:03:28.600> back<00:03:28.900> over<00:03:29.140> so<00:03:29.380> you're<00:03:29.500> looking<00:03:29.590> at

flip that back over so you're looking at
the<00:03:29.950> front<00:03:30.329> you're<00:03:31.329> going<00:03:31.450> to<00:03:31.510> take<00:03:31.690> your
