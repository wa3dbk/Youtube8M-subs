00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
it has enhanced BTX which mean that this

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.109 
it has enhanced BTX which mean that this
board<00:00:19.500> actually<00:00:20.070> is<00:00:20.340> going<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.550> feel<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:20.910> lot

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
surfy ER and a little looser when you're

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.089 
surfy ER and a little looser when you're
tracking<00:00:24.269> straight<00:00:24.720> flat<00:00:25.109> base<00:00:25.380> but<00:00:25.949> when

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
tracking straight flat base but when

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.730 
tracking straight flat base but when
you're<00:00:26.279> not<00:00:26.490> on<00:00:26.730> an<00:00:26.939> edge<00:00:27.090> it's<00:00:27.420> gonna<00:00:27.630> be<00:00:27.900> have

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
you're not on an edge it's gonna be have

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.650 
you're not on an edge it's gonna be have
a<00:00:28.769> dime<00:00:29.130> light<00:00:29.400> precision<00:00:30.029> it's<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.269> really

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
a dime light precision it's a really

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.139 
a dime light precision it's a really
well-rounded<00:00:31.410> board<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.099> it's<00:00:32.219> great<00:00:32.640> in<00:00:32.850> pow

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
well-rounded board and it's great in pow

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.030 
well-rounded board and it's great in pow
it's<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.750> twin<00:00:34.020> board<00:00:34.290> with<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.649> centered<00:00:35.010> stance

it's a twin board with a centered stance

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.600 
it's a twin board with a centered stance
and<00:00:35.670> like<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.239> said<00:00:36.360> an<00:00:36.660> enhanced<00:00:37.320> BTX<00:00:38.160> profile

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
and like I said an enhanced BTX profile

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.430 
and like I said an enhanced BTX profile
there's<00:00:39.030> an<00:00:39.149> enhance<00:00:39.510> rocker<00:00:39.930> shape<00:00:40.230> it's

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
there's an enhance rocker shape it's

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.530 
there's an enhance rocker shape it's
actually<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.739> little<00:00:40.950> bit<00:00:41.160> deeper<00:00:41.610> than<00:00:41.790> most

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
actually a little bit deeper than most

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.569 
actually a little bit deeper than most
like<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.930> BT<00:00:43.230> X<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.950> has<00:00:44.070> traditional

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
like the BT X and it has traditional

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.520 
like the BT X and it has traditional
camber<00:00:44.940> from<00:00:45.270> underneath<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.750> feet<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.350> the

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
camber from underneath the feet to the

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.889 
camber from underneath the feet to the
contact<00:00:47.070> points<00:00:47.430> overall<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.329> banana<00:00:48.660> magic

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
contact points overall the banana magic

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.830 
contact points overall the banana magic
snowboard<00:00:49.530> will<00:00:49.800> have<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.250> flex<00:00:50.610> rating<00:00:50.840> right

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
snowboard will have a flex rating right

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.930 
snowboard will have a flex rating right
about<00:00:52.079> in<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.230> middle<00:00:52.289> maybe<00:00:52.890> five<00:00:53.309> maybe<00:00:53.610> six

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
about in the middle maybe five maybe six

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.209 
about in the middle maybe five maybe six
lip<00:00:54.780> says<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.410> deck<00:00:55.590> will<00:00:55.800> have<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:55.949> flex

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
lip says that the deck will have a flex

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.889 
lip says that the deck will have a flex
rating<00:00:56.280> depending<00:00:57.120> on<00:00:57.180> what<00:00:57.329> size<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.750> get

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
rating depending on what size you get

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.840 
rating depending on what size you get
from<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.500> six<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:58.980> seven<00:00:59.340> I'd<00:00:59.460> say<00:00:59.670> it's

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
from a six to a seven I'd say it's

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.670 
from a six to a seven I'd say it's
probably<00:01:00.329> like<00:01:00.660> about<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.930> five<00:01:01.199> point<00:01:01.469> five

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
probably like about a five point five

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.820 
probably like about a five point five
across<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.670> entire<00:01:03.059> line<00:01:03.359> now<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.500> banana

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
across the entire line now the banana

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.350 
across the entire line now the banana
magic<00:01:05.010> does<00:01:05.400> have<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.640> horse<00:01:06.060> power

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
magic does have a horse power

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.850 
magic does have a horse power
construction<00:01:07.020> which<00:01:07.409> means<00:01:07.439> there's<00:01:07.799> a

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
construction which means there's a

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.620 
construction which means there's a
combination<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.880> Polonia<00:01:09.330> wood<00:01:10.850> Aspen<00:01:11.850> XL<00:01:12.360> and

combination of Polonia wood Aspen XL and

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.260 
combination of Polonia wood Aspen XL and
then<00:01:13.080> power<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.740> which<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.430> just<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.909> great

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
then power a which is just a great

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.630 
then power a which is just a great
combination<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.900> both<00:01:16.049> light<00:01:16.619> poppy<00:01:17.340> and

combination of both light poppy and

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.510 
combination of both light poppy and
lively<00:01:18.180> woods<00:01:18.450> but<00:01:18.840> what<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.259> cool<00:01:19.619> about<00:01:19.830> this

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
lively woods but what is cool about this

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.890 
lively woods but what is cool about this
Coors<00:01:20.850> actually<00:01:21.330> it's<00:01:21.420> been<00:01:21.570> wrapped<00:01:21.780> in

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
Coors actually it's been wrapped in

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
basalt it's volcanic rock fibers there's

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.050 
basalt it's volcanic rock fibers there's
actually<00:01:24.720> no<00:01:24.900> fiberglass<00:01:25.439> inside<00:01:26.250> now<00:01:26.759> one

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
actually no fiberglass inside now one

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.730 
actually no fiberglass inside now one
thing<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.270> really<00:01:27.540> makes<00:01:27.689> this<00:01:27.990> board<00:01:28.229> stand

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
thing that really makes this board stand

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.950 
thing that really makes this board stand
out<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.100> become<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.369> little<00:01:29.880> bit<00:01:30.000> poppier<00:01:30.540> a

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
out and become a little bit poppier a

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.289 
out and become a little bit poppier a
little<00:01:31.259> bit<00:01:31.350> more<00:01:31.560> snappy<00:01:32.460> edge<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.880> edge<00:01:33.030> is

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
little bit more snappy edge to edge is

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.149 
little bit more snappy edge to edge is
actually<00:01:33.780> going<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.200> be<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.710> ultra<00:01:35.009> high

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
actually going to be the ultra high

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.130 
actually going to be the ultra high
molecular<00:01:35.189> weighted<00:01:35.790> sidewall<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.600> the

internal sidewall the sidewall has a

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.240 
internal sidewall the sidewall has a
sidewall<00:01:39.930> which<00:01:39.960> is<00:01:40.200> actually<00:01:40.590> birch<00:01:40.979> wood

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
sidewall which is actually birch wood

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.789 
sidewall which is actually birch wood
saying<00:01:41.820> basically<00:01:42.119> from<00:01:42.720> tip<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:42.960> tail<00:01:43.290> now

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
saying basically from tip to tail now
