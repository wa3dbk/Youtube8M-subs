had lower and drop off which means that

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.450 
had lower and drop off which means that

and<00:01:46.489> was<00:01:46.940> rather<00:01:47.090> easy<00:01:47.420> to<00:01:47.690> switch<00:01:47.929> in<00:01:48.170> and<00:01:48.410> out

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
and was rather easy to switch in and out

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.190 
and was rather easy to switch in and out
between<00:01:48.920> clip<00:01:49.429> sizes<00:01:49.879> so<00:01:50.840> what<00:01:51.020> would<00:01:51.140> happen

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
between clip sizes so what would happen

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.109

did<00:02:32.810> have<00:02:32.990> a<00:02:33.020> three<00:02:33.320> to<00:02:33.440> four<00:02:33.620> shot<00:02:33.860> kill<00:02:34.100> range

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
did have a three to four shot kill range

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.580 
did have a three to four shot kill range
this<00:02:34.820> weapon<00:02:35.240> did<00:02:35.420> have<00:02:35.660> a<00:02:35.690> bit<00:02:35.990> more<00:02:36.050> recoil

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
this weapon did have a bit more recoil

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:37.990 
this weapon did have a bit more recoil
than<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.890> other<00:02:37.040> assault<00:02:37.430> rifle<00:02:37.790> so<00:02:37.940> you

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
than the other assault rifle so you

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.660 
than the other assault rifle so you
would<00:02:38.360> tend<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:38.870> waste<00:02:39.170> a<00:02:39.350> bit<00:02:39.500> of<00:02:39.620> ammo<00:02:39.830> the

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
would tend to waste a bit of ammo the

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.690 
would tend to waste a bit of ammo the
scar-h<00:02:41.450> also<00:02:41.900> had<00:02:42.080> a<00:02:42.260> rather<00:02:42.470> high<00:02:42.830> headshot

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
scar-h also had a rather high headshot

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.570 
scar-h also had a rather high headshot
multiplier<00:02:43.940> and<00:02:44.660> it<00:02:45.110> had<00:02:45.290> lower<00:02:45.620> end<00:02:45.980> rate<00:02:46.340> of

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
multiplier and it had lower end rate of

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.600 
multiplier and it had lower end rate of
fire<00:02:46.880> it<00:02:47.240> did<00:02:47.390> only<00:02:47.920> 645<00:02:48.920> rounds<00:02:49.310> per<00:02:49.460> minute

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
fire it did only 645 rounds per minute

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.550 
fire it did only 645 rounds per minute
but<00:02:50.270> when<00:02:50.420> you<00:02:50.510> combine<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:51.050> lower<00:02:51.230> end

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
but when you combine the lower end

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.380 
but when you combine the lower end
rounds<00:02:52.070> per<00:02:52.250> minute<00:02:52.400> with<00:02:52.880> the<00:02:53.060> amount<00:02:53.270> of

rounds per minute with the amount of
damage<00:02:53.720> and<00:02:53.840> actually<00:02:54.290> allowed<00:02:54.500> it<00:02:54.590> to<00:02:54.620> have<00:02:54.800> a

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
damage and actually allowed it to have a

also did do less damage than was

also did do less damage than was

the<00:03:29.340> scar-h<00:03:29.819> it<00:03:30.300> only<00:03:30.510> did<00:03:30.810> 35<00:03:31.319> to<00:03:31.560> 20<00:03:31.860> damage

the scar-h it only did 35 to 20 damage
but<00:03:32.370> again<00:03:32.640> it<00:03:32.880> had<00:03:33.300> that<00:03:33.480> very<00:03:33.780> low<00:03:34.350> drop<00:03:34.739> off

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
but again it had that very low drop off

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.800 
but again it had that very low drop off
and<00:03:35.190> damage<00:03:35.640> which<00:03:36.209> means<00:03:36.420> was<00:03:36.630> very

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
and damage which means was very

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
the very very low recoil of the scar l

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:43.699 
the very very low recoil of the scar l
you<00:03:42.330> were<00:03:42.420> able<00:03:42.569> to<00:03:42.720> make<00:03:42.810> a<00:03:42.959> machine<00:03:43.410> that<00:03:43.590> was

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
you were able to make a machine that was

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.340 
you were able to make a machine that was
just<00:03:43.890> a<00:03:44.010> laser<00:03:44.280> beam<00:03:44.640> of<00:03:44.819> death<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:45.840> scar<00:03:46.140> l

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
just a laser beam of death the scar l

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.470 
just a laser beam of death the scar l
had<00:03:46.590> three<00:03:47.010> to<00:03:47.190> five<00:03:47.430> shots<00:03:47.760> to<00:03:48.000> kill<00:03:48.209> and

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
had three to five shots to kill and

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.449 
had three to five shots to kill and
again<00:03:48.750> had<00:03:49.049> such<00:03:49.319> a<00:03:49.500> low<00:03:49.650> recoil<00:03:49.890> that<00:03:50.340> you

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
again had such a low recoil that you

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.490 
again had such a low recoil that you
could<00:03:50.640> barely<00:03:50.880> notice<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:52.019> amount<00:03:52.230> of<00:03:52.290> time

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
could barely notice the amount of time

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.500 
could barely notice the amount of time
it<00:03:52.530> would<00:03:52.769> take<00:03:52.830> to<00:03:53.069> kill<00:03:53.400> someone<00:03:53.760> even<00:03:54.360> when

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
it would take to kill someone even when

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.120 
it would take to kill someone even when
you<00:03:54.600> were<00:03:54.720> at<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:54.840> max<00:03:55.140> distance<00:03:55.410> and<00:03:55.890> needed

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
you were at the max distance and needed

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.820 
you were at the max distance and needed
five<00:03:56.400> shots<00:03:56.730> that<00:03:56.940> killed<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:57.959> scar<00:03:58.230> l<00:03:58.440> also

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
five shots that killed the scar l also

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.059 
five shots that killed the scar l also
had<00:03:59.100> a<00:03:59.340> 1.5<00:04:00.239> x<00:04:00.569> headshot<00:04:01.230> multiplier<00:04:01.410> which<00:04:01.920> is

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
had a 1.5 x headshot multiplier which is

had a 1.5 x headshot multiplier which is
the<00:04:02.220> most<00:04:02.459> among<00:04:02.819> any<00:04:03.120> of<00:04:03.480> these<00:04:03.660> scars<00:04:03.989> in

call of duty and it was actually the

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:53.509 
ops 2 had 30 rounds in a magazine and it

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:57.790 
ops 2 had 30 rounds in a magazine and it
also<00:04:53.690> did<00:04:54.050> an<00:04:54.229> amazing<00:04:54.710> 45<00:04:55.669> max<00:04:56.629> damage<00:04:57.050> now

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
also did an amazing 45 max damage now

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.710 
also did an amazing 45 max damage now
although<00:04:58.069> it<00:04:58.340> did<00:04:58.520> do<00:04:58.669> a<00:04:58.699> ton<00:04:59.090> of<00:04:59.120> damage<00:04:59.419> it

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
although it did do a ton of damage it

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.200 
although it did do a ton of damage it
did<00:04:59.840> see<00:05:00.050> a<00:05:00.080> steep<00:05:00.500> drop-off<00:05:01.099> and<00:05:01.280> damage<00:05:01.729> it

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
did see a steep drop-off and damage it

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.570 
did see a steep drop-off and damage it
dropped<00:05:02.629> down<00:05:02.810> all<00:05:03.139> the<00:05:03.319> way<00:05:03.470> to<00:05:03.530> 24<00:05:04.310> hit

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
dropped down all the way to 24 hit

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.330 
dropped down all the way to 24 hit
points<00:05:05.000> so<00:05:05.690> basically<00:05:06.169> this<00:05:06.470> just<00:05:06.800> meant<00:05:07.039> that

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
points so basically this just meant that

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.700 
points so basically this just meant that
the<00:05:07.759> scar-h<00:05:08.360> would<00:05:08.720> take<00:05:08.960> three<00:05:09.319> to<00:05:09.470> five

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
the scar-h would take three to five

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.040 
the scar-h would take three to five
shots<00:05:10.310> to<00:05:10.550> kill<00:05:10.759> in<00:05:10.970> order<00:05:11.060> to<00:05:11.300> get<00:05:11.419> someone<00:05:11.690> up

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
shots to kill in order to get someone up

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.649 
shots to kill in order to get someone up
close<00:05:12.409> three<00:05:12.650> shots<00:05:12.889> at<00:05:13.190> a<00:05:13.250> distance<00:05:13.759> 5<00:05:14.030> so<00:05:14.599> it

00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:14.659 
close three shots at a distance 5 so it

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:15.909 
close three shots at a distance 5 so it
was<00:05:14.750> definitely<00:05:14.870> one<00:05:15.169> of<00:05:15.199> those<00:05:15.319> guns<00:05:15.560> were<00:05:15.650> up

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
was definitely one of those guns were up

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:17.649 
was definitely one of those guns were up
close<00:05:16.159> we<00:05:16.280> were<00:05:16.400> destroying<00:05:16.849> people<00:05:17.240> but<00:05:17.479> then

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:17.659 
close we were destroying people but then

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:19.059 
close we were destroying people but then
added<00:05:18.050> this<00:05:18.169> tint<00:05:18.440> it<00:05:18.590> would<00:05:18.680> take<00:05:18.830> you<00:05:18.949> away

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:19.069 
added this tint it would take you away

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:21.730 
added this tint it would take you away
quite<00:05:19.430> a<00:05:19.460> little<00:05:19.849> bit<00:05:19.969> of<00:05:20.060> time<00:05:20.289> apart<00:05:21.289> from

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
quite a little bit of time apart from

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.920 
quite a little bit of time apart from
that<00:05:21.770> the<00:05:22.099> scar-h<00:05:22.490> actually<00:05:23.000> had<00:05:23.150> the<00:05:23.300> slowest

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
that the scar-h actually had the slowest

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.629 
that the scar-h actually had the slowest

from all the other colors duties at 600
rounds<00:05:28.370> per<00:05:28.610> minute<00:05:28.969> now<00:05:29.900> when<00:05:30.229> you<00:05:30.319> combine

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
rounds per minute now when you combine

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.219 
rounds per minute now when you combine
that<00:05:30.800> with<00:05:30.860> the<00:05:31.069> increased<00:05:31.849> amount<00:05:32.030> of<00:05:32.569> damage

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:33.229 
that with the increased amount of damage

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:35.980 
that with the increased amount of damage
it<00:05:33.409> actually<00:05:33.830> allowed<00:05:34.729> for<00:05:35.000> a<00:05:35.030> medium<00:05:35.509> recoil

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
it actually allowed for a medium recoil

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.680 
it actually allowed for a medium recoil
it<00:05:36.110> wasn't<00:05:36.469> as<00:05:36.620> bad<00:05:36.650> as<00:05:36.949> a<00:05:37.190> recoil<00:05:37.759> from<00:05:38.300> some

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
it wasn't as bad as a recoil from some

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.240 
it wasn't as bad as a recoil from some
of<00:05:38.810> the<00:05:38.930> other<00:05:38.960> assault<00:05:39.560> rifles<00:05:39.620> that<00:05:40.069> has

of the other assault rifles that has
lower<00:05:40.729> recoil<00:05:41.030> than<00:05:41.330> the<00:05:41.509> an-94<00:05:42.139> but<00:05:43.099> because

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
lower recoil than the an-94 but because

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.909 
lower recoil than the an-94 but because
of<00:05:43.580> this<00:05:43.849> high<00:05:44.150> damage<00:05:44.449> it<00:05:45.020> still<00:05:45.409> had<00:05:45.650> quite<00:05:45.889> a

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 
of this high damage it still had quite a

it<00:06:14.810> was<00:06:14.930> actually<00:06:15.379> the<00:06:15.590> scar<00:06:15.949> l<00:06:16.159> from<00:06:16.520> modern

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:16.940 
it was actually the scar l from modern

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.390 
it was actually the scar l from modern
warfare<00:06:17.270> 3<00:06:17.740> now<00:06:18.740> you<00:06:18.800> guys<00:06:18.949> probably<00:06:19.099> want<00:06:19.310> to

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 
warfare 3 now you guys probably want to

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.700 
warfare 3 now you guys probably want to
know<00:06:19.460> why<00:06:19.669> exactly<00:06:20.029> is<00:06:20.389> the<00:06:20.750> scar<00:06:21.110> l<00:06:21.289> from

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:21.710 
know why exactly is the scar l from

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.350 
know why exactly is the scar l from
modern<00:06:21.979> warfare<00:06:22.129> 3<00:06:22.310> better<00:06:22.729> than<00:06:22.909> the<00:06:22.969> scar-h

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 
modern warfare 3 better than the scar-h

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.540 
modern warfare 3 better than the scar-h
from<00:06:23.659> modern<00:06:23.960> warfare<00:06:24.110> 2<00:06:24.409> and<00:06:24.620> black<00:06:25.039> ops<00:06:25.279> 2

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:25.550 
from modern warfare 2 and black ops 2

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.570 
from modern warfare 2 and black ops 2
the<00:06:26.240> reason<00:06:26.569> being<00:06:26.810> is<00:06:27.139> that<00:06:27.199> the<00:06:27.680> scar<00:06:28.009> l<00:06:28.250> from

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:28.580 
the reason being is that the scar l from

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.279 
the reason being is that the scar l from
modern<00:06:28.879> warfare<00:06:29.060> 3<00:06:29.240> was<00:06:29.629> just<00:06:29.870> a<00:06:30.020> more

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:30.289 
modern warfare 3 was just a more

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:33.339 
modern warfare 3 was just a more
versatile<00:06:30.919> weapon<00:06:31.190> than<00:06:31.849> d<00:06:32.029> scar-h<00:06:32.539> it<00:06:33.169> had<00:06:33.319> a

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:33.349 
versatile weapon than d scar-h it had a

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:35.559 
versatile weapon than d scar-h it had a
higher<00:06:33.620> rate<00:06:33.949> of<00:06:33.979> fire<00:06:34.340> it<00:06:34.669> had<00:06:34.909> very<00:06:35.240> low

00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:35.569 
higher rate of fire it had very low

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:38.589 
higher rate of fire it had very low
recoil<00:06:35.840> it<00:06:36.500> had<00:06:36.740> enough<00:06:37.610> bullets<00:06:38.060> to<00:06:38.330> take

00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:38.599 
recoil it had enough bullets to take

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:40.540 
recoil it had enough bullets to take
someone<00:06:38.990> down<00:06:39.020> it<00:06:39.469> wasn't<00:06:39.800> limited<00:06:39.979> like<00:06:40.340> the

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:40.550 
someone down it wasn't limited like the

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.580 
someone down it wasn't limited like the
20<00:06:40.940> rounds<00:06:41.240> that<00:06:41.300> were<00:06:41.360> in<00:06:41.659> the<00:06:41.900> scar-h<00:06:42.199> from

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:42.590 
20 rounds that were in the scar-h from

20 rounds that were in the scar-h from
modern<00:06:42.860> warfare<00:06:43.039> 2<00:06:43.400> and<00:06:43.639> overall<00:06:44.449> it<00:06:44.719> was<00:06:44.840> just

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:44.870 
modern warfare 2 and overall it was just

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.769 
modern warfare 2 and overall it was just
a<00:06:45.289> better<00:06:45.529> weapon<00:06:45.860> it<00:06:46.550> had<00:06:46.729> very<00:06:46.969> consistent

00:06:47.769 --> 00:06:47.779 
a better weapon it had very consistent

00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:49.779 
a better weapon it had very consistent
it<00:06:47.870> wasn't<00:06:48.229> it<00:06:48.500> didn't<00:06:48.919> have<00:06:49.039> a<00:06:49.069> ton<00:06:49.339> of<00:06:49.399> drop

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:49.789 
it wasn't it didn't have a ton of drop

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:51.239 
it wasn't it didn't have a ton of drop
out<00:06:50.000> which<00:06:50.180> allowed<00:06:50.419> it<00:06:50.570> to<00:06:50.599> take<00:06:50.870> someone

00:06:51.239 --> 00:06:51.249 
out which allowed it to take someone

00:06:51.249 --> 00:06:53.159 
out which allowed it to take someone
out<00:06:51.369> and<00:06:51.579> then<00:06:51.969> combine<00:06:52.329> that<00:06:52.509> with<00:06:52.569> the<00:06:52.989> low

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:53.169 
out and then combine that with the low

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:55.079 
out and then combine that with the low
recoil<00:06:53.409> it<00:06:53.829> was<00:06:53.949> just<00:06:54.189> something<00:06:54.699> that<00:06:54.909> was

00:06:55.079 --> 00:06:55.089 
recoil it was just something that was

00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:57.809
