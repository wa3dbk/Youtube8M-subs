00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
loved the burgundy version last year

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.759

to<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.170> Burgundy<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.950> think<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.700> just<00:00:35.820> has<00:00:36.090> more

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
of a purplish on to toe it's quite a

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.750 
of a purplish on to toe it's quite a
jewel<00:00:39.090> tone<00:00:39.360> it's<00:00:39.870> really<00:00:40.379> gorgeous<00:00:40.579> as<00:00:41.579> you

know all of the hardware on here is gold

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.540 
know all of the hardware on here is gold
so<00:00:53.449> the<00:00:54.449> chain<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:55.410> classic<00:00:55.800> Jane<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.250> gold

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
so the chain the classic Jane is gold

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.290 
so the chain the classic Jane is gold
and<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.239> zippers<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:58.550> Clipper<00:00:59.550> there's

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
and the zippers and the Clipper there's

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.170 
and the zippers and the Clipper there's
all<00:01:00.480> gold<00:01:01.160> which<00:01:02.160> i<00:01:02.309> think<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.699> good<00:01:02.969> because

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
all gold which i think is good because

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.630 
all gold which i think is good because
if<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.629> would<00:01:03.750> silver<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.260> don't<00:01:05.189> think<00:01:05.460> it

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
if it would silver I don't think it

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.690 
if it would silver I don't think it
would<00:01:05.790> suit<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.210> bag<00:01:06.390> as<00:01:06.570> well<00:01:07.400> inside<00:01:08.400> is

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
would suit the bag as well inside is

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.789 
would suit the bag as well inside is
obviously<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.270> classic<00:01:10.110> Rebecca<00:01:10.409> Minkoff

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
crossbody bags that are lightweight

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.020 
crossbody bags that are lightweight

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
because i don't like heavy bags and this

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.030 
because i don't like heavy bags and this
one<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.390> actually<00:01:33.570> my<00:01:34.020> heaviest<00:01:34.409> crossbody

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.039
