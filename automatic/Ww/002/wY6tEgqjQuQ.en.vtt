you have cross bars and roof rails

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:41.940 
you have cross bars and roof rails
versus<00:01:40.659> having<00:01:40.810> to<00:01:40.959> add<00:01:41.139> them<00:01:41.409> and<00:01:41.560> then

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
versus having to add them and then

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.679 
versus having to add them and then
you've<00:01:42.069> also<00:01:42.159> got<00:01:42.369> a<00:01:42.520> full<00:01:42.579> glass<00:01:42.909> moonroof<00:01:43.270> on

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
out to the country signs something like

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.090 
out to the country signs something like
that<00:01:49.539> and<00:01:49.959> of<00:01:50.170> course<00:01:50.409> the<00:01:50.560> biggest<00:01:50.889> thing

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
that and of course the biggest thing

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.739 
that and of course the biggest thing
with<00:01:51.219> Suber<00:01:51.579> is<00:01:51.670> its<00:01:51.880> symmetrical<00:01:52.389> all-wheel

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:52.749 
with Suber is its symmetrical all-wheel

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:54.809 
with Suber is its symmetrical all-wheel

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:00.300 
it it could be across or up and down
it's<00:01:58.060> going<00:01:58.240> to<00:01:58.450> be<00:01:58.600> exactly<00:01:59.499> the<00:01:59.770> same<00:02:00.039> all

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
it's going to be exactly the same all

the<00:02:00.369> way<00:02:00.520> around<00:02:00.789> that's<00:02:01.240> what's<00:02:01.420> gonna<00:02:01.539> give

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:01.749 
the way around that's what's gonna give

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:03.929 
the way around that's what's gonna give
it<00:02:01.899> such<00:02:02.079> balance<00:02:02.560> handling<00:02:03.039> but<00:02:03.340> Subaru<00:02:03.819> is

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
it such balance handling but Subaru is

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:07.080 
it such balance handling but Subaru is

also<00:02:17.320> you're<00:02:17.500> going<00:02:17.650> to<00:02:17.740> see

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
also you're going to see

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:24.630 
also you're going to see
is<00:02:19.060> its<00:02:19.390> boxer<00:02:19.840> engine<00:02:22.980> now<00:02:23.980> you've<00:02:24.160> also<00:02:24.310> got

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
is its boxer engine now you've also got

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.460 
is its boxer engine now you've also got
hydraulic<00:02:25.060> hood<00:02:25.210> props<00:02:25.510> too<00:02:25.810> just<00:02:26.080> to<00:02:26.140> start

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
hydraulic hood props too just to start

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.770 
hydraulic hood props too just to start
off<00:02:26.620> but<00:02:27.400> what<00:02:27.580> makes<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.910> Subaru<00:02:28.270> so<00:02:28.510> unique

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
off but what makes the Subaru so unique

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.260 
off but what makes the Subaru so unique
is<00:02:28.960> this<00:02:29.080> engine<00:02:29.500> most<00:02:30.040> engines<00:02:30.580> you<00:02:31.060> have

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
is this engine most engines you have

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.910 
is this engine most engines you have
like<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.630> V<00:02:31.750> engine<00:02:32.080> where<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.320> Pistons<00:02:32.710> are

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
like the V engine where the Pistons are

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.800 
like the V engine where the Pistons are
going<00:02:33.130> like<00:02:33.340> this<00:02:33.610> or<00:02:34.000> you<00:02:34.120> have<00:02:34.150> an<00:02:34.540> inline

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
going like this or you have an inline

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.180 
going like this or you have an inline
engine<00:02:35.140> where<00:02:35.290> they're<00:02:35.470> all<00:02:35.590> in<00:02:35.710> a<00:02:35.770> row

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
engine where they're all in a row

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.280 
engine where they're all in a row
and<00:02:36.550> they're<00:02:36.910> going<00:02:37.060> like<00:02:37.300> this<00:02:37.450> what<00:02:37.870> Subaru

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
and they're going like this what Subaru

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.200 
and they're going like this what Subaru
does<00:02:38.530> is<00:02:38.800> it<00:02:38.980> has<00:02:39.070> a<00:02:39.130> horizontally<00:02:39.850> opposed

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
does is it has a horizontally opposed

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.170 
does is it has a horizontally opposed
engine<00:02:40.600> known<00:02:40.810> as<00:02:40.960> a<00:02:40.990> boxer<00:02:41.410> engine<00:02:42.060> you<00:02:43.060> know

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
engine known as a boxer engine you know

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.640 
engine known as a boxer engine you know
what<00:02:43.360> that<00:02:43.510> is<00:02:43.540> is<00:02:43.930> it's<00:02:44.080> the<00:02:44.140> Pistons<00:02:44.470> going

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
what that is is it's the Pistons going

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.590 
what that is is it's the Pistons going
out<00:02:44.890> to<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.220> sides<00:02:45.460> it's<00:02:46.060> going<00:02:46.210> to<00:02:46.270> be<00:02:46.360> a<00:02:46.390> lot

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
out to the sides it's going to be a lot

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.840 
out to the sides it's going to be a lot
smoother<00:02:47.170> of<00:02:47.290> a<00:02:47.350> ride<00:02:47.530> you<00:02:48.430> know<00:02:48.460> the<00:02:48.700> higher

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
smoother of a ride you know the higher

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.940 
smoother of a ride you know the higher
revs<00:02:49.180> things<00:02:49.540> like<00:02:49.750> that<00:02:50.050> the<00:02:50.560> other<00:02:50.650> thing<00:02:50.860> is

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
revs things like that the other thing is

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.200 
revs things like that the other thing is
-<00:02:51.160> as<00:02:51.220> it<00:02:51.340> spreads<00:02:51.580> the<00:02:51.640> weight<00:02:51.790> out<00:02:51.970> a<00:02:52.000> lot

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
- as it spreads the weight out a lot

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.490 
- as it spreads the weight out a lot
more<00:02:52.390> which<00:02:52.630> is<00:02:52.780> part<00:02:53.020> of<00:02:53.050> what<00:02:53.140> gives<00:02:53.290> that

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
more which is part of what gives that

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.200 
more which is part of what gives that
Subaru<00:02:53.830> such<00:02:54.160> good<00:02:54.370> handling<00:02:54.850> it's<00:02:55.060> gonna

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.210 
Subaru such good handling it's gonna

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.270 
Subaru such good handling it's gonna
handle<00:02:55.600> a<00:02:55.720> lot<00:02:55.930> smoother<00:02:56.710> go<00:02:57.040> around<00:02:57.220> the

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
handle a lot smoother go around the
