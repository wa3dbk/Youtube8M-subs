was<00:01:33.000> definitely<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.450> good<00:01:33.600> gameplay<00:01:33.990> maybe<00:01:34.200> one

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
was definitely a good gameplay maybe one

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.770 
was definitely a good gameplay maybe one
of<00:01:34.409> my<00:01:34.530> better<00:01:34.770> ones<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.310> I've<00:01:35.430> gotten<00:01:35.850> some

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
of my better ones that I've gotten some

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.940 
of my better ones that I've gotten some
of<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.930> guys<00:01:36.990> actually<00:01:37.200> might<00:01:37.500> already<00:01:37.650> seen

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
of you guys actually might already seen

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.260 
of you guys actually might already seen
if<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.100> can<00:01:38.280> if<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.790> came<00:01:38.970> over<00:01:39.090> from

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
if you can if you came over from

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.300 
if you can if you came over from
rednecks<00:01:39.720> channel<00:01:40.079> it's<00:01:40.200> actually<00:01:40.740> the

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
rednecks channel it's actually the

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.330 
rednecks channel it's actually the
gameplay<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.820> we<00:01:41.939> used<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:43.250> don't<00:01:44.250> be

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
gameplay that we used so don't be

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.969 
gameplay that we used so don't be
expecting<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.880> maybe<00:01:45.299> I'm<00:01:45.540> not<00:01:45.689> really<00:01:45.810> sure

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
expecting that maybe I'm not really sure

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.080 
expecting that maybe I'm not really sure
but<00:01:46.979> here<00:01:47.130> let's<00:01:47.310> get<00:01:47.460> back<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.729> this<00:01:47.820> series

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
but here let's get back to this series

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.030 
but here let's get back to this series
so<00:01:48.540> like<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.170> was<00:01:49.290> saying<00:01:49.439> it's<00:01:49.770> basically

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
so like I was saying it's basically

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.460 
so like I was saying it's basically
where<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.280> clutch<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.880> get<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.119> nuke<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:52.020> I

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
where I clutch it to get the nuke and I

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.440 
where I clutch it to get the nuke and I
kind<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:53.100> kind<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.700> want<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:53.880> try<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.149> do<00:01:54.329> it

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
kind of I kind of want to try to do it

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.420 
kind of I kind of want to try to do it
for<00:01:54.509> every<00:01:54.630> single<00:01:54.899> map<00:01:55.140> but<00:01:55.619> probably<00:01:56.280> not

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
for every single map but probably not

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.090 
for every single map but probably not
for<00:01:56.610> rust<00:01:56.880> or<00:01:57.119> something<00:01:57.360> like<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:57.479> cuz<00:01:58.100> to

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
for rust or something like that cuz to

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.039 
for rust or something like that cuz to
get<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.549> have<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.759> be<00:01:59.880> playing<00:02:00.119> 6v6<00:02:00.540> and

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
get that you have to be playing 6v6 and

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.560 
get that you have to be playing 6v6 and
that's<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.259> pain<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:02.280> maybe<00:02:02.880> basically<00:02:03.450> all

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
that's a pain so maybe basically all

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.179 
that's a pain so maybe basically all
ground<00:02:03.869> war<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.409> I'll<00:02:04.530> try<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.740> do<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.100> for

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
ground war and I'll try to do it for

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.639 
ground war and I'll try to do it for
every<00:02:05.399> map<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.880> maybe<00:02:06.570> if<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:07.170> guys<00:02:07.290> enjoyed

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
every map and maybe if you guys enjoyed

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.410 
every map and maybe if you guys enjoyed
this<00:02:07.799> series<00:02:07.979> maybe<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.520> respawn<00:02:08.970> army<00:02:09.300> will

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420

him<00:02:20.690> to<00:02:20.810> be<00:02:20.930> too<00:02:21.200> so<00:02:21.650> I've<00:02:21.770> kind<00:02:21.980> of<00:02:22.040> come<00:02:22.190> to<00:02:22.310> a

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
him to be too so I've kind of come to a

him to be too so I've kind of come to a
conclusion<00:02:22.520> that<00:02:23.120> I<00:02:23.360> might<00:02:24.140> just<00:02:24.290> be

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
conclusion that I might just be
