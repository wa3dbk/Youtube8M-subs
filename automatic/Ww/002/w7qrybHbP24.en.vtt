heart<00:01:58.799> so<00:01:58.979> that's<00:01:59.159> kind<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.369> cool

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
heart so that's kind of cool

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.319 
heart so that's kind of cool
so<00:02:00.630> overall<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:02.189> vehicle<00:02:02.490> mode<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.880> quite

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
so overall the vehicle mode is quite

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.319 
so overall the vehicle mode is quite
awesome<00:02:04.100> to<00:02:05.100> transform<00:02:05.700> Ironhide<00:02:06.119> we're

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
awesome to transform Ironhide we're

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.940 
awesome to transform Ironhide we're
going<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.509> do<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:06.960> we're<00:02:07.320> going<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.560> kind<00:02:07.890> of

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
going to do is we're going to kind of

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.339 
going to do is we're going to kind of
grab<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.129> section<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.849> fold<00:02:09.090> this<00:02:09.239> out<00:02:09.420> like

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
grab the section and fold this out like

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.949 
grab the section and fold this out like
that<00:02:10.590> go<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.069> fold<00:02:11.340> out<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.550> feet<00:02:11.870> split<00:02:12.870> the

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
that go to fold out the feet split the

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.850 
that go to fold out the feet split the
legs

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
legs

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.680 
legs

I sell actually come on here we're gonna

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.690 
I sell actually come on here we're gonna
rotate<00:02:15.930> them<00:02:16.790> inwards<00:02:17.790> like<00:02:17.910> this<00:02:18.890> I<00:02:19.890> may<00:02:20.550> have

the<00:02:24.450> new<00:02:24.660> versions<00:02:25.110> of<00:02:25.200> Ironhide<00:02:25.620> in<00:02:25.890> the

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
the new versions of Ironhide in the

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.380

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
gonna fold this back about 40 forward

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.360 
gonna fold this back about 40 forward
sorry<00:02:43.020> I'm<00:02:43.320> gonna<00:02:43.470> flip<00:02:43.680> this<00:02:43.770> down<00:02:45.080> try<00:02:46.080> to

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
sorry I'm gonna flip this down try to

sorry I'm gonna flip this down try to
you<00:02:47.370> know<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.610> transformation<00:02:48.000> this<00:02:48.390> bit<00:02:48.660> is

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
you know the transformation this bit is

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.190 
you know the transformation this bit is
just<00:02:48.990> kind<00:02:49.230> of<00:02:49.260> awkward<00:02:50.690> you<00:02:51.690> know<00:02:51.810> that<00:02:51.989> arm

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
just kind of awkward you know that arm

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.600 
just kind of awkward you know that arm
is<00:02:52.380> just<00:02:52.410> popping<00:02:53.190> off<00:02:55.190> there<00:02:56.190> we<00:02:56.280> go

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
is just popping off there we go

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.699 
is just popping off there we go
then<00:02:57.090> we're<00:02:57.239> gonna<00:02:57.330> attempt<00:02:58.110> to<00:02:58.200> grab<00:02:58.560> the

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
then we're gonna attempt to grab the

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.300 
then we're gonna attempt to grab the
head<00:02:59.150> there<00:03:00.150> we<00:03:00.239> go<00:03:00.360> and<00:03:01.200> then<00:03:01.620> it<00:03:01.890> does<00:03:02.070> kind

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
head there we go and then it does kind

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.650 
head there we go and then it does kind
of<00:03:02.340> peg<00:03:02.640> in<00:03:02.820> you<00:03:03.090> just<00:03:03.150> kind<00:03:03.330> of<00:03:03.360> pull<00:03:03.570> it

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
of peg in you just kind of pull it

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.449 
of peg in you just kind of pull it
forward<00:03:03.989> then<00:03:04.620> we<00:03:04.709> can<00:03:04.860> rotate<00:03:05.040> everything

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
forward then we can rotate everything

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.199 
forward then we can rotate everything
down<00:03:06.530> sorry<00:03:07.530> I<00:03:07.590> got<00:03:07.800> cold<00:03:08.100> and<00:03:08.370> there<00:03:09.090> is

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
down sorry I got cold and there is

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.740 
down sorry I got cold and there is
Ironhide<00:03:09.660> in<00:03:10.230> robot<00:03:10.950> mode<00:03:11.000> now<00:03:12.000> right<00:03:12.390> off<00:03:12.540> the

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
Ironhide in robot mode now right off the

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.270 
Ironhide in robot mode now right off the
bat<00:03:12.930> you<00:03:13.110> can<00:03:13.290> probably<00:03:13.500> see<00:03:13.739> a<00:03:13.770> few<00:03:13.860> little

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
bat you can probably see a few little

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.130 
bat you can probably see a few little
problems<00:03:14.489> the<00:03:14.850> main<00:03:15.030> problem<00:03:15.420> being<00:03:15.690> that<00:03:15.840> the

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
problems the main problem being that the

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.449 
problems the main problem being that the
arms<00:03:16.440> are<00:03:16.620> tiny<00:03:17.220> and<00:03:17.580> they're<00:03:18.090> also<00:03:18.239> set<00:03:18.720> way

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
arms are tiny and they're also set way

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.120 
arms are tiny and they're also set way
backwards<00:03:20.630> usually<00:03:21.630> I'm<00:03:22.320> supposed<00:03:22.920> to<00:03:23.010> be

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
backwards usually I'm supposed to be

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.860 
backwards usually I'm supposed to be
kind<00:03:23.340> of<00:03:23.459> here<00:03:23.700> for<00:03:23.970> these<00:03:24.090> are<00:03:24.299> really<00:03:24.690> far

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
kind of here for these are really far

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.330 
kind of here for these are really far
back<00:03:25.049> there's<00:03:25.769> no<00:03:25.890> way<00:03:26.010> you<00:03:26.070> can<00:03:26.220> actually

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
back there's no way you can actually

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.740 
back there's no way you can actually
bring<00:03:26.549> them<00:03:26.670> forward<00:03:26.910> which<00:03:27.209> kind<00:03:27.450> of<00:03:27.480> sucks

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
bring them forward which kind of sucks

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.699 
bring them forward which kind of sucks
and<00:03:28.049> so<00:03:29.010> he's<00:03:29.190> always<00:03:29.310> gonna<00:03:29.549> be<00:03:29.700> kind<00:03:29.910> of

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
and so he's always gonna be kind of

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.680 
and so he's always gonna be kind of
having<00:03:31.709> his<00:03:31.799> arms<00:03:32.100> out<00:03:32.250> kinda<00:03:33.239> like<00:03:33.330> that<00:03:33.510> if

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
having his arms out kinda like that if

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.330 
having his arms out kinda like that if
you<00:03:33.780> can't<00:03:33.989> bring<00:03:34.170> him<00:03:34.290> down<00:03:34.440> to<00:03:34.470> his<00:03:34.680> side<00:03:34.920> so

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
you can't bring him down to his side so

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.699 
you can't bring him down to his side so
it's<00:03:35.489> kind<00:03:35.700> of<00:03:35.730> got<00:03:35.850> a<00:03:35.910> boys<00:03:36.150> like<00:03:36.390> that<00:03:36.709> it

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
it's kind of got a boys like that it

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:38.900 
it's kind of got a boys like that it
does<00:03:37.830> sort<00:03:38.100> of<00:03:38.190> look<00:03:38.250> better<00:03:38.580> when<00:03:38.700> you<00:03:38.790> put

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
does sort of look better when you put

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.610 
does sort of look better when you put
the<00:03:39.000> cannons<00:03:39.360> on<00:03:41.750> yeah<00:03:42.750> you<00:03:42.900> can<00:03:43.019> put<00:03:43.530> the

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
the cannons on yeah you can put the

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.320 
the cannons on yeah you can put the
cannons<00:03:43.950> on<00:03:44.070> I<00:03:44.310> don't<00:03:44.760> even<00:03:44.820> know<00:03:45.000> if<00:03:45.120> about

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
cannons on I don't even know if about

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.280 
cannons on I don't even know if about
these<00:03:45.450> on<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.600> right<00:03:45.780> arm<00:03:45.959> I<00:03:46.230> think<00:03:46.320> I<00:03:48.290> don't

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
these on the right arm I think I don't

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.350 
these on the right arm I think I don't
really<00:03:49.440> pay<00:03:49.620> that<00:03:49.769> much<00:03:49.920> attention<00:03:53.299> there<00:03:54.299> we

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
really pay that much attention there we

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.440 
really pay that much attention there we

a smaller version of Ironhide there you
know<00:04:03.030> really<00:04:03.660> works<00:04:03.810> well<00:04:04.080> and<00:04:04.290> I'm<00:04:04.410> an<00:04:05.010> iodide

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
small version of Ironhide and I thought

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.270 
small version of Ironhide and I thought
to<00:04:15.660> what<00:04:15.780> symbol<00:04:16.079> on<00:04:16.169> there<00:04:16.350> and<00:04:16.560> the<00:04:17.160> head

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
like how you know the chess piece I want

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
like how you know the chess piece I want
to<00:04:36.820> fit<00:04:37.000> it<00:04:37.090> if<00:04:37.180> these<00:04:37.270> could<00:04:37.510> you<00:04:37.600> should<00:04:37.720> go

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
to fit it if these could you should go

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.380 
to fit it if these could you should go
up<00:04:37.930> a<00:04:38.050> little<00:04:38.290> bit<00:04:38.410> more<00:04:38.560> like<00:04:39.550> that<00:04:39.580> and<00:04:40.030> they

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
up a little bit more like that and they

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.090 
up a little bit more like that and they
didn't<00:04:40.600> have<00:04:40.720> this<00:04:40.870> kind<00:04:41.050> of<00:04:41.200> thing<00:04:41.470> sticking

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
didn't have this kind of thing sticking

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.450 
didn't have this kind of thing sticking
okay<00:04:42.400> looks<00:04:42.550> like<00:04:42.580> a<00:04:42.670> hunchback<00:04:44.310> that's<00:04:45.310> my

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
okay looks like a hunchback that's my

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.480 
okay looks like a hunchback that's my
main<00:04:46.200> gripe<00:04:47.200> with<00:04:47.470> the<00:04:47.530> figure<00:04:47.920> but<00:04:48.160> you<00:04:48.370> know

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
main gripe with the figure but you know

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.990 
main gripe with the figure but you know
yeah<00:04:49.300> it's<00:04:49.720> okay<00:04:50.020> it's<00:04:50.170> passable<00:04:50.550> in<00:04:51.550> terms<00:04:51.850> of

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
yeah it's okay it's passable in terms of

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.390 
yeah it's okay it's passable in terms of
your<00:04:52.120> articulation<00:04:52.830> we've<00:04:53.830> got<00:04:53.950> a<00:04:53.980> ball<00:04:54.220> joint

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
your articulation we've got a ball joint

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.150 
your articulation we've got a ball joint
here<00:04:54.700> at<00:04:54.760> the<00:04:54.820> hip<00:04:55.030> ball<00:04:55.810> jointed<00:04:56.170> knees<00:04:56.230> and

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
here at the hip ball jointed knees and

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.880 
here at the hip ball jointed knees and
the<00:04:57.310> other<00:04:57.460> pivot<00:04:58.240> on<00:04:58.390> her<00:04:58.480> feet<00:04:58.770> kind<00:04:59.770> of

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
the other pivot on her feet kind of

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.710 
the other pivot on her feet kind of
little<00:05:00.070> hinge<00:05:00.250> joint<00:05:00.520> and<00:05:01.240> he's<00:05:01.360> got<00:05:01.450> a<00:05:01.480> ball

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
little hinge joint and he's got a ball

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.080 
little hinge joint and he's got a ball
joint<00:05:01.930> up<00:05:02.260> here<00:05:02.530> at<00:05:02.620> the<00:05:02.680> shoulder<00:05:02.910> he's<00:05:03.910> got<00:05:04.060> a

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
joint up here at the shoulder he's got a

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.120 
joint up here at the shoulder he's got a
hinge<00:05:04.270> joint<00:05:04.360> at<00:05:04.630> the<00:05:04.690> elbow<00:05:04.960> head<00:05:05.710> is<00:05:05.920> on<00:05:06.100> a

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
hinge joint at the elbow head is on a

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.900 
hinge joint at the elbow head is on a
ball-joint<00:05:06.430> kind<00:05:07.360> of<00:05:08.160> no<00:05:09.160> it's<00:05:09.520> not

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
ball-joint kind of no it's not

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.060 
ball-joint kind of no it's not
thought<00:05:10.840> it<00:05:10.990> was<00:05:11.110> but<00:05:11.380> it<00:05:11.680> doesn't<00:05:11.920> look<00:05:12.040> like

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
thought it was but it doesn't look like

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:18.450 
thought it was but it doesn't look like
it<00:05:16.320> that's<00:05:17.320> about<00:05:17.500> all<00:05:17.710> the<00:05:17.890> observation<00:05:18.370> is

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
it that's about all the observation is

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.880 
it that's about all the observation is
gonna<00:05:18.610> get<00:05:19.290> no<00:05:20.290> waist<00:05:20.530> articulation<00:05:22.230> but<00:05:23.230> it's

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:23.890 
gonna get no waist articulation but it's

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.210 
gonna get no waist articulation but it's
okay<00:05:24.190> I<00:05:24.370> mean<00:05:24.610> it's<00:05:25.240> a<00:05:25.300> nice<00:05:25.480> articulation<00:05:26.320> get

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
okay I mean it's a nice articulation get

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.580 
okay I mean it's a nice articulation get
him<00:05:27.310> into<00:05:27.520> a<00:05:27.550> few<00:05:27.790> little<00:05:27.910> poses<00:05:28.270> and<00:05:29.230> as

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
him into a few little poses and as

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.830 
him into a few little poses and as
always<00:05:29.860> here<00:05:30.430> is<00:05:30.580> the<00:05:30.850> comparison<00:05:31.480> with

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
always here is the comparison with

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.630 
always here is the comparison with
windcharger<00:05:32.470> I<00:05:32.950> don't<00:05:33.160> know<00:05:33.220> why<00:05:33.400> I<00:05:33.430> keep

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:33.640 
windcharger I don't know why I keep

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.920 
windcharger I don't know why I keep
bringing<00:05:33.940> out<00:05:34.000> windcharger<00:05:34.390> I<00:05:34.600> think<00:05:34.810> it's

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
bringing out windcharger I think it's

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.120 
bringing out windcharger I think it's
just<00:05:35.110> the<00:05:35.200> fact<00:05:35.350> that<00:05:35.470> I've<00:05:35.650> actually<00:05:35.800> got<00:05:36.100> a

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
just the fact that I've actually got a

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.240 
just the fact that I've actually got a
winch<00:05:36.400> on<00:05:36.610> tonight's<00:05:37.060> show<00:05:37.150> it<00:05:37.360> up<00:05:37.510> something

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
winch on tonight's show it up something

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.310 
winch on tonight's show it up something
I'm<00:05:39.250> just<00:05:39.310> like<00:05:39.610> that<00:05:39.820> I'm<00:05:40.120> smug<00:05:40.420> I<00:05:40.690> know<00:05:41.020> you

I'm just like that I'm smug I know you

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.780 
I'm just like that I'm smug I know you
can<00:05:41.500> see<00:05:41.650> the<00:05:41.770> size<00:05:41.950> differences<00:05:42.520> and

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:42.790 
can see the size differences and

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.460 
can see the size differences and
wincharger<00:05:43.300> obviously<00:05:43.720> the<00:05:43.780> bigger<00:05:43.930> figure<00:05:44.110> I

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
wincharger obviously the bigger figure I

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.960 
wincharger obviously the bigger figure I
know<00:05:44.650> it's<00:05:44.860> a<00:05:44.980> slightly<00:05:45.310> bigger<00:05:45.580> cyberverse

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
know it's a slightly bigger cyberverse

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.270 
know it's a slightly bigger cyberverse
