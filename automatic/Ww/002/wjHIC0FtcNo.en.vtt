00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.420
 Hello everyone 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.109
 today let's see how to make snow 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.119
 pretend to decorate our creations 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:24.769
 we will use vinyl glue la 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.660
 glitter glitter shaving foam 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:29.760
 white a spatula a container 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.949
 where to create our ship and me 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.040
 I will use a glass greenhouse flap for 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.340
 dry it all take it immediately 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.340
 vinyl glue 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.310
 let's put some glue 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.310
 fill 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.260
 the bottom of the glass 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.809
 and then we put some foam 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:23.290
 and here we have our snow 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:24.910
 glitter looks like soft snow 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.340
 we can add them or directly the 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.979
 compound or on the support in which 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.910
 let's go and spread our snow there 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.300
 I will add directly on the card 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:40.479
 so first 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:42.910
 let's spread the snow abound because 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.690
 we must when it dries up a little 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.690
 narrows 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.440
 then we put the glitter 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.140
 is 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.140
 we mix again 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:38.359
 I do this so as not to have too many 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:40.540
 the same glitter we do from the other 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:40.540
 side 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:09.010
 after filling the entire surface 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:13.000
 with our snow we dry with 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:16.600
 moves when dries the snow creates one 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.210
 the hardest surface layer is if it is 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.780
 touch it inside you can still hear it 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:25.350
 soft so the effect is created 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.350
 soft snow 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.960
 the top layer is dry and therefore 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.050
 I don't know if it also makes the video good 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:04:01.680
 however we have both an effect 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:04:04.080
 fluffy under this part of a 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.000
 creation that I will show you in the next 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.850
 days on what to expect 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.780
 go and create your snow yourself 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.680
 See you soon 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.680
 bye Bye
