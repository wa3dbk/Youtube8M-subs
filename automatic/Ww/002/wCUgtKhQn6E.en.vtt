 flour that I did dilute them in 

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:21.670
 the Anglo is to sink the leaves 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:24.189
 military and finally you need 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.869
 also the brick sheets is then 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:28.299
 for preparation I'm just going to 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.520
 pour the parsley and cilantro on the 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:33.280
 minced meat 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:38.850

 food of course it's optional 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:01.439
 prove to his shutters not to put in 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.890
 more to bring a color to the 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.509
 prank call 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:08.489
 here is the elbow 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.319
 of course I'm not going to do it because 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.599
 that planned cube is already salty I want 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.329
 not add sophie scene if it's 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.910
 necessary 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:20.120
 here I am going to put some oil 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.120
 olive 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.680
 I will mix well 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:43.670
 then in a pan I will do 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:49.069
 simple the free and I will bring back 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.900
 the onion offered to thin slices on 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:57.130
 medium heat 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:59.390
 pepper and tomatoes 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.330
 you can very well take 1 tomato 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:05.590
 normal if you want to be well 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.590
 peel it in small dice 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:19.510
 now I'm going to bring back 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.510
 together will form 15 minutes 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:32.090
 I just want to add some water not 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.680
 you fit on here and now I 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.810
 I will bring the whole thing back in the air 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.829
 in fifteen minutes until 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:41.810
 the whole is well reduced then after 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:44.060
 have brown onion tomatoes 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:49.819
 and peppers together that we can 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:52.420
 add the chicken pm and of course for 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:57.170
 quantities to decrease them 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:58.400
 and then we mix on fire 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.670
 way it will be necessary to cook the meat 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.670
 chopped 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.290
 of course you have to cook until you 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.180
 that there is no more juice because 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.890
 if you leave the juice in your stuffing 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.019
 the problem is that the leaves of 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.640
 brick they will absorb the juice and the 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.049
 blow they will select is for 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.940
 that it is very important so good of 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.889
 leave your blush on fire 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.239
 what is harder 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:24.690
 so as soon as your prank is ready and 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:27.540
 stinking juice now I will 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.070
 pour 2.1 or a plate but ensures 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.720
 is very important to leave well 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.280
 cool because if you put there 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.850
 by his hot body in the leaves 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.220
 of brick 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.800
 it risks precisely a risk of 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.400
 tear then as soon as your stuffing and 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.110
 cold 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.840
 now I'm going to enjoy leaves 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:46.040
 of brig as I disavow could very 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.910
 well replace by curtain parties 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:52.830
 then I'm going to cut them there of course 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:54.840
 I will make small triangles after 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:59.660
 0.9 double triangle just the 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.660
 cut in large width 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:09.860
 then you take a little bit of 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.860
 prank call 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:19.830
 you put afar on your sheet of 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:20.539
 broken then brought that side there that's like 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:25.530
 it 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:29.720
 then bring it back to one side and that side 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:33.200
 here no 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:36.960
 then we will go to that part 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:38.130
 and then that part there is then 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.580
 I will sink the sheet 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:47.240
 finally the triangle with the flour that 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:47.240
 I mixed with a little water like that 

00:05:51.209 --> 00:05:54.209
 so 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.710
 so I will start again no I like to be 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:02.470
 a little stuffing 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:04.000
 then I bring that side here 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.949
 sure with your fingers it must be tight 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.500
 the farce for the part they stay at 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:14.680
 the interior so that it does not escape 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:16.780
 then here I bring the stuff here 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.199
 is like that and then I put a little 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.479
 of flour 

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:20.710
 finally the ends here who likes them 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:21.930
 who exceeds you can very well 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:26.770
 divided 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:28.389
 this is of course to support him triangle 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.310
 you can very well freeze them if 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:31.300
 you can if you want to have some in 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.550
 your freezer 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.440
 it can be kept very well in the freezer 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.050
 just take them out just before 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.310
 a few hours before cooking 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:42.190
 especially if you receive from the world by 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:43.599
 example and not to be overwhelmed you 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.270
 can very well prepare them in 

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:48.550
 in advance just freeze them then 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:50.050
 quickly the triangles ready to do 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.159
 heat the sunflower oil it takes 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.130
 that she is well thing is very 

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:59.259
 important and it will be necessary to put then 

00:06:54.130 --> 00:07:02.409
 sorting them from inside the cooking is 

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:05.370
 really very fast and too much justice and 

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:05.370
 adored of charity 

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.580
