the side that's actually going to make

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
the side that's actually going to make
it<00:01:47.820> come<00:01:48.450> part<00:01:48.689> use<00:01:48.810> two<00:01:48.990> sections<00:01:49.549> and

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
it come part use two sections and

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.810 
it come part use two sections and
actually<00:01:51.630> going<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.930> use<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.409> end<00:01:52.610> that<00:01:53.610> has<00:01:53.790> a

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
at that part when it comes off but the

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.160 
at that part when it comes off but the
filter<00:02:32.790> on<00:02:32.910> it<00:02:32.940> was<00:02:33.150> not<00:02:33.330> nearly<00:02:33.540> as<00:02:33.720> good<00:02:33.780> as

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
filter on it was not nearly as good as

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.570 
filter on it was not nearly as good as
the<00:02:34.319> the<00:02:34.530> replacement<00:02:35.099> part<00:02:35.250> I<00:02:35.310> think<00:02:35.489> they

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
the the replacement part I think they

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.940 
the the replacement part I think they
realized<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.330> lot<00:02:36.989> of<00:02:37.140> dirt<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.319> it's<00:02:37.680> up<00:02:37.799> in

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
realized a lot of dirt and it's up in

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.850 
realized a lot of dirt and it's up in
this<00:02:38.040> area<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:39.590> hesitancy<00:02:40.590> to<00:02:40.620> make<00:02:40.769> the

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
this area and hesitancy to make the

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.130 
this area and hesitancy to make the
filter<00:02:41.160> go<00:02:41.280> bad<00:02:41.489> we'll<00:02:42.180> follow<00:02:42.390> it<00:02:42.569> back<00:02:42.690> it's

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
filter go bad we'll follow it back it's

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.800 
filter go bad we'll follow it back it's
got<00:02:43.319> this<00:02:43.470> other<00:02:43.620> flexible<00:02:44.220> line<00:02:44.510> if<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:45.630> look

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
got this other flexible line if you look

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.539 
got this other flexible line if you look
over<00:02:46.140> and<00:02:46.650> I<00:02:46.860> think<00:02:47.099> that's<00:02:47.280> our<00:02:47.430> little

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
over and I think that's our little

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.850 
over and I think that's our little
carbon<00:02:48.030> box<00:02:48.239> over<00:02:48.569> there<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:49.230> that<00:02:49.380> bottom<00:02:49.769> of

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
carbon box over there and that bottom of

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.140 
carbon box over there and that bottom of
the<00:02:49.920> two<00:02:50.130> hose<00:02:50.340> is<00:02:50.549> that<00:02:50.670> I'm<00:02:50.760> pointing<00:02:50.910> at

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
the two hose is that I'm pointing at

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.550 
the two hose is that I'm pointing at
right<00:02:51.390> now<00:02:51.540> it<00:02:51.720> looks<00:02:51.900> like<00:02:51.959> where<00:02:52.260> it's<00:02:52.380> going

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
right now it looks like where it's going

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.370 
right now it looks like where it's going
to<00:02:52.620> end<00:02:52.769> up<00:02:52.860> connecting<00:02:53.220> we'll<00:02:53.549> have<00:02:53.670> to

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
to end up connecting we'll have to

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.900 
to end up connecting we'll have to
disconnect<00:02:55.380> that<00:02:55.500> with<00:02:55.829> a<00:02:55.860> probably<00:02:56.819> a

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
disconnect that with a probably a

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.819 
disconnect that with a probably a
flathead<00:02:57.239> screwdriver<00:02:57.269> but<00:02:57.959> I'm<00:02:58.530> going<00:02:58.709> to<00:02:58.769> go

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829

see<00:03:24.180> how<00:03:24.269> dirty<00:03:24.510> it<00:03:24.720> is<00:03:24.780> looking<00:03:25.709> at<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:25.859> old

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
see how dirty it is looking at the old

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.860 
see how dirty it is looking at the old
hose<00:03:26.250> it<00:03:26.730> had<00:03:26.880> a<00:03:26.910> filter<00:03:27.299> that<00:03:27.329> was<00:03:27.569> kind<00:03:27.780> of

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
hose it had a filter that was kind of

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.789 
hose it had a filter that was kind of
like<00:03:28.019> this<00:03:28.260> not<00:03:29.160> very<00:03:29.430> useful<00:03:29.940> but<00:03:30.680> kind<00:03:31.680> of<00:03:31.709> a

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
like this not very useful but kind of a

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.360 
like this not very useful but kind of a
bad<00:03:31.980> design<00:03:32.510> coming<00:03:33.510> back<00:03:33.690> little<00:03:33.989> ways<00:03:34.370> you

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
bad design coming back little ways you

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.920 
bad design coming back little ways you
can<00:03:35.549> see<00:03:35.670> this<00:03:35.819> part<00:03:36.120> coming<00:03:36.420> up<00:03:36.510> right<00:03:36.720> here

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
can see this part coming up right here

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.050 
can see this part coming up right here
where<00:03:37.889> I<00:03:37.950> was<00:03:38.130> pointing<00:03:38.489> to<00:03:38.519> earlier<00:03:38.910> it's

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
where I was pointing to earlier it's

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.970 
where I was pointing to earlier it's
actually<00:03:39.299> a<00:03:39.329> little<00:03:39.420> bit<00:03:39.510> further<00:03:39.900> north<00:03:40.709> than

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
actually a little bit further north than

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.319 
actually a little bit further north than
I<00:03:41.069> thought<00:03:41.310> whenever<00:03:41.670> I<00:03:41.760> went<00:03:41.910> to<00:03:42.000> get<00:03:42.120> it<00:03:42.209> off

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
I thought whenever I went to get it off

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.180 
I thought whenever I went to get it off
it's<00:03:42.989> got<00:03:43.109> a<00:03:43.139> really<00:03:43.319> strange<00:03:43.680> clip<00:03:43.980> though

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
it's got a really strange clip though

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.110 
it's got a really strange clip though
when<00:03:45.090> you<00:03:45.180> push<00:03:45.389> in<00:03:46.160> on<00:03:47.160> this<00:03:47.370> this<00:03:47.880> piece

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
when you push in on this this piece

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.759 
when you push in on this this piece
right<00:03:48.299> here<00:03:48.389> I'll<00:03:48.930> turn<00:03:49.230> it<00:03:49.350> over<00:03:49.440> so<00:03:49.590> you<00:03:49.680> can

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
right here I'll turn it over so you can

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.890 
right here I'll turn it over so you can
see<00:03:49.980> it<00:03:50.100> better<00:03:50.220> it's<00:03:51.180> kind<00:03:51.329> of<00:03:51.359> like<00:03:51.540> a<00:03:51.569> button

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
see it better it's kind of like a button

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.349 
see it better it's kind of like a button
I<00:03:52.170> suggest<00:03:52.769> that<00:03:52.859> you<00:03:52.980> kind<00:03:53.190> of<00:03:53.280> pull<00:03:53.819> this

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
I suggest that you kind of pull this

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.360 
I suggest that you kind of pull this
thing<00:03:54.600> out<00:03:54.720> with<00:03:54.900> your<00:03:55.019> hand<00:03:55.290> while<00:03:56.190> you're

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
thing out with your hand while you're

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.460 
thing out with your hand while you're
pushing<00:03:56.730> in<00:03:56.819> the<00:03:56.910> very<00:03:57.120> very<00:03:57.420> center<00:03:57.900> with<00:03:58.440> a

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
pushing in the very very center with a

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.050 
pushing in the very very center with a
flathead<00:03:58.769> screwdriver<00:03:58.950> as<00:03:59.579> hard<00:03:59.730> as<00:03:59.819> you<00:03:59.910> can

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
flathead screwdriver as hard as you can

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.339 
flathead screwdriver as hard as you can
to<00:04:00.180> try<00:04:00.239> to<00:04:00.359> get<00:04:00.540> these<00:04:00.630> teeth<00:04:00.900> to<00:04:01.079> spread

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
to try to get these teeth to spread

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:03.559 
to try to get these teeth to spread
apart<00:04:01.620> to<00:04:01.739> let<00:04:01.889> go<00:04:02.099> now<00:04:02.790> make<00:04:03.060> it<00:04:03.209> easier<00:04:03.510> on

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
apart to let go now make it easier on

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.050 
apart to let go now make it easier on
you<00:04:03.840> but<00:04:04.250> yeah<00:04:05.250> pretty<00:04:05.430> filthy<00:04:05.730> there's<00:04:06.000> a

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
you but yeah pretty filthy there's a

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.220 
you but yeah pretty filthy there's a
little<00:04:06.209> difference<00:04:06.329> in<00:04:06.630> the<00:04:06.720> brackets<00:04:07.139> you

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
little difference in the brackets you

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.810 
little difference in the brackets you
see<00:04:07.380> how<00:04:07.440> that<00:04:07.650> one<00:04:07.799> kind<00:04:08.010> of<00:04:08.069> loops<00:04:08.489> around

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
see how that one kind of loops around

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.599 
see how that one kind of loops around
well<00:04:09.720> the<00:04:09.810> new<00:04:09.930> bracket<00:04:10.380> attaches<00:04:10.590> on<00:04:10.919> the

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
well the new bracket attaches on the

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:13.430 
well the new bracket attaches on the
right<00:04:12.060> hand<00:04:12.299> side<00:04:12.419> of<00:04:12.690> it<00:04:12.780> and<00:04:12.870> goes<00:04:12.989> back<00:04:13.229> so

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
right hand side of it and goes back so

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.030 
right hand side of it and goes back so
you<00:04:13.530> have<00:04:13.620> to

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
you have to

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.649 
you have to
which<00:04:14.340> brings<00:04:14.579> me<00:04:14.670> to<00:04:14.879> my<00:04:14.939> next<00:04:15.000> point<00:04:15.239> the

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:15.659 
which brings me to my next point the

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:18.110 
which brings me to my next point the
bolt<00:04:16.500> actually<00:04:17.250> goes<00:04:17.400> through<00:04:17.639> the<00:04:17.729> top<00:04:17.940> of

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
bolt actually goes through the top of

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.879 
bolt actually goes through the top of
this<00:04:18.299> and<00:04:18.570> it's<00:04:18.750> really<00:04:18.810> close<00:04:19.289> to<00:04:19.350> the<00:04:19.560> bottom

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
this and it's really close to the bottom

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.680 
this and it's really close to the bottom
of<00:04:19.949> the<00:04:20.039> truck<00:04:20.280> so<00:04:21.000> you're<00:04:21.299> going<00:04:21.449> to<00:04:21.509> have<00:04:21.600> to

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
of the truck so you're going to have to

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.360 
of the truck so you're going to have to
reach<00:04:21.810> your<00:04:21.840> hands<00:04:22.139> up<00:04:22.229> and<00:04:22.560> over<00:04:22.919> to<00:04:23.220> get<00:04:23.310> to

place<00:04:41.750> wheel<00:04:42.750> wells<00:04:42.990> probably<00:04:43.350> not<00:04:43.440> the<00:04:43.560> best

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
place wheel wells probably not the best

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.950 
place wheel wells probably not the best
place<00:04:43.919> for<00:04:44.009> it<00:04:44.340> I<00:04:44.639> toyed<00:04:45.210> with<00:04:45.240> the<00:04:45.570> idea<00:04:45.600> of<00:04:45.900> a

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
place for it I toyed with the idea of a

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.740 
place for it I toyed with the idea of a
few<00:04:46.139> others<00:04:46.440> but<00:04:46.470> honestly<00:04:47.330> it<00:04:48.330> seems<00:04:48.509> like

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
few others but honestly it seems like

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.689 
few others but honestly it seems like
it's<00:04:48.960> a<00:04:49.020> gamble<00:04:49.349> either<00:04:49.590> way<00:04:49.740> you<00:04:50.400> can<00:04:50.550> tell

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:50.699 
it's a gamble either way you can tell

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:52.249 
it's a gamble either way you can tell
the<00:04:50.729> new<00:04:50.910> equipment<00:04:51.180> as<00:04:51.509> we<00:04:51.660> travel<00:04:52.020> up<00:04:52.080> the

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:52.259 
the new equipment as we travel up the

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:57.320 
the new equipment as we travel up the
line<00:04:54.500> bring<00:04:55.500> it<00:04:55.650> on<00:04:55.740> over<00:04:55.970> there's<00:04:56.970> a<00:04:57.030> nice<00:04:57.300> new
