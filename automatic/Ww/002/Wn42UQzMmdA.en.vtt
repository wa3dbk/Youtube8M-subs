00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.050
 to the videos fast 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.930
 it's good that you are going to choose the 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.560
 block they want I chose the brick 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:29.080
 that is being recorded and project for 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.860
 make a beautiful house 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.040
 okay 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.820
 the plant is going to be the shit a villager 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:41.780
 mom that the plant is going to be 4 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.500
 this part we leave this we go for 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.340
 here 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.110
 A) Yes 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:51.050
 also 4 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.090
 this is left blank 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:58.570
 and what will fail the height that 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.570
 I want to plan 16 2 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:05.310
 3. 4. 5 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:11.300
 678 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.300
 9 20 14 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.390

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.650
 ok ourense 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:31.099
 we already returned friends I wanted to say 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.519
 this must be left I did 16 so I 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:33.519
 it would be 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.260
 it looks like a face 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.980
 this part where you want to analyze these 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.790
 two for the ports and put what 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:50.320
 they put so that it improves boat of better 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.320
 since we see a line of three 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.120
 to enjoy 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.620
 so they would not be able to 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:08.950
 for that it supports it well said a life 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:15.879
 of tapas some batteries 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:15.879
 good good 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:25.120
 I would have killed themselves 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:30.189
 I do not know radio here what there was then 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:34.740
 we would make these the bars or how 

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:34.740
 I do not have in that language it would be like that 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:40.519
 we would put you 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:48.730
 I am abysmal stone in this part back 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:54.389
 in that part the blocks they chose and 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:56.950
 here the bars so that for total 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:05:00.100
 then as an enclosure will follow if 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:03.790
 let's save the lighter or lose it 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:05.990
 iron and then put here to come out 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.560
 a chimney 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.750
 we surround you 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:15.830
 with the desired height of you 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:18.820
 my dear subscribers who will 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:21.400
 make a goal 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:24.660
 but so that they do not get bored, move a 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:28.120
 little girls I will not cut it ok 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.680
 we promote although I have continued this 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.750
 chapter is only going to be like fireplace 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.150
 but you lack things for the 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.980
 convenient now what we would do that 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:39.250
 you get ready 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:44.190
 that we take for the things of Chile 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:44.190
 he occupied little by little 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:50.669
 because the plant is strong 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:53.160
 we go for a cut we keep 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:56.630
 posters that I have for wood at 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:59.590
 Dutch wants they decided 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.590
 and if they 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:07.490
 how many chairs five and how many what is 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:07.490
 good for everyone 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:17.640
 ok this would be like that of two blocks of 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:17.640
 long we put the blocks have 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:26.530
 allowed this brother is very 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:29.370
 confused and the stairs 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:32.680
 so we could commit or in debt put 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:35.430
 to accept it looks like a 9 although for 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:39.750
 wait for the truck 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:41.670
 but well everyone counts among those who 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.930
 tiptoe without would be a fireplace this 

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:46.350
 chapter floor do with the chimneys 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:48.420
 then how much time late but good 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:50.490
 for another one though this with bricks and 

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.840
 it's because the progress because I said that 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:54.450
 I was going to be flat but I 'm not going to 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:57.030
