00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:08.340
 Battlefield 4 wants the developer 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.230
 there is the unpredictability and the 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.269
 typical battlefield moments of the 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.040
 multiplayer mode also in the story 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.920
 campaign bring what that means exactly 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.539
 and what plans the team has as well 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.939
 we have the creative director and 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.670
 Battlefield veterans Lars Gustafsson 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.289
 asked when the presenter restarted 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.599
 we had just started this project 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.460
 Battlefield 3 finished on it 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.140
 We were very proud and found that we 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.969
 much of what we achieve with it 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.860
 also wanted to have done it if it 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.059
 a weakness had then knows that is missing 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.950
 the battlefield experience in 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.140
 singleplayer mode the big one was missing 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.550
 destroy the many devices and 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.350
 the free decisions we have 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.270
 So, how can we better him 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.770
 Match the game with the match 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.120
 Both the individual and the 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.280
 multiplayer mode after battlefield 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.230
 Feels in the presentation of 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.030
 battlefield 4 to get to for example 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.920
 the construction site at the we level the far 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.870
 You can open vehicles 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.440
 use as much or as little 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.480
 as you like 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.340
 you must specify its goals score 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.199
 just like one also in the multiplayer enemies 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.309
 can scoff and the players then the 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.140
 opened fire 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.700
 And also allowed the helicopter targets 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.979
 pretends something in the multiplayer part 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.540
 the player may play his own 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.130
 change gear and join his 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.539
 own way over the battlefield tracks 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.079
 instead of being prescribed by us 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:17.850
 to get 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:19.770
 this is a weapon and you have to go now 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.360
 this time it's more about that 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.679
 independence of the player 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.369
 Players should have their own experience 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:25.369
 can create 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.399
 in the presentation has already been 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:34.619
 hinted that the usa war in china 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:38.149
 The Chinese are the ones who want to lead 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.149
 new fraction in bed fell 4 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.750
 It seems like in China at least 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.000
 in the singleplayer campaign 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.000
 Everything I can say is mysterious 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:52.349
 in battlefield 3 there was next to the solo 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.630
 campaign and the multiplayer mode too 

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:57.439
 he becomes the co-op mode for two players 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.439
 because return 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.130
 This time we are against it 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.140
 decided to make a co- op mode 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.789
 the thought behind it is the following 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.649
 we want from the solo campaign 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.539
 make great battlefield experience 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.250
 and our multiplayer mode is already 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.450
 strong on the cooperative aspect 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.640
 to play together with friends 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.930
 That's why we preferred to 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.730
 on single and multiplayer mode 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.209
 focus and make it a great one 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.209
 make a game 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.829
 this question is heard at dice determined 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.850
 Constantly the commander mode returns 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:32.069
 battlefield 4 back 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.170
 i love this question yes we will 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.280
 asked very often 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.480
 At the moment we only want to use the 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.250
 speak solo campaign 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.750
 Later we will say what it is 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.260
 new and cool in multiplayer mode 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.579
 gives 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.109
 I would love you more 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:45.889
 tell about it but you still have to 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:45.889
 wait a little longer 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.800
 a clear dementi sounds in any case 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.600
 different 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.350
 which platform is the lead platform 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.350
 for battlefield 4 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.600
 the demo that we showed you ran 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.340
 of course on a pc 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.990
 but we have not yet 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.590
 once internally on a lead platform 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.480
 set 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.800
 a key feature of the frost at 3 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.760
 engine is that they are very 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.590
 is scalable 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.270
 Of course, we're trying for one thing 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.380
 to grab the stars what they are 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.300
 hopefully seen in the presentation 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.160
 and at the same time 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.720
 make it scalable to anyone 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:28.030
 platform can customize for the us 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:30.580
 Battlefield 4 release in the year 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.740
 2010 release of battlefield bad 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.530
 company 2 has patrick bach of dice 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.330
 said that you never have money for 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.130
 battlefield cards would take 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.870
 but there are already five 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.460
 paid addons for battlefield 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.460
 3 what has changed? 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.140
 what has changed 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.209
 At first it's not like we do it 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.709
 just to bring out a two maps it is yes 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.360
 Almost as if every age were and 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.459
 in itself a half multiplayer game 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.900
 I would say that's a pretty 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.270
 Great piece of software is that we have the 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.220
 sell customers there and that comes 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.290
 our premium customers are now 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.780
 very good at almost 29 million 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.850
 the concept behind premium is yes that 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.110
 On the one hand it is a good offer and 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.680
 At the same time you are right up there 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.870
 is 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.310
 I personally have the feeling that we 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.390
 a lot of content for the money 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.950
 deliver that is paid 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:24.090
 especially if you do it with one 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.090
 full game compares 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.190
 lars gustafsson is a real one 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.710
 Battlefield veteran from the beginning on 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.960
 the series has worked there 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:43.460
 a special battlefield moment 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.460
 he still remembers today 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.790
 there is no one of me again and again 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.920
 that was not necessary during the development 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.970
 of battlefield 2 I think because there are 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.770
 also to see on the internet 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.020
 it is probably the rocket by the 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.060
 Helicopter flies then we wanted 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.110
 we are showing the game electronic arts 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.710
 were pending verification for 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.690
 Companies 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.800
 so we flew to england around 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.020
 to imagine 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.820
 So we have the whole day on the 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.740
 played to goalkeeper lenz and 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.660
 recorded to see while doing one 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.790
 But nobody comes out of the cool scene 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.620
 has seen something great only one day 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.390
 after our return has our video 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.130
 is a moment found by looking into 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.080
 black hawk helicopters are flown 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.580
 Our song tester sat at the mini can 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.690
 and another guy is with one 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.000
 enemy jet flown 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.870
 He's looking for a heat-seeking rocket 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.880
 shot down 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.760
 I thought she had gone wrong 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.110
 because I threw off body and he 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.130
 thought it would be about us 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.290
 actually hit clear but 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.210
 nothing happened is the tester has but 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.770
 seen that the rocket right on him 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.280
 flown across the cabin 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.870
 is 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.610
 and that's exactly what we have 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.320
 captured on video in screenshots 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.560
 that's the beautiful thing for me 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.560
 missing 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.750
 and today we have the metal 43 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.190
 only in battlefield videos where the people 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.470
 organize similar stuff 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.690
 have you seen the endgame where the guy 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.310
 in the air off the motorcycle descends one 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.750
 heli shoots with the panzerfaust and 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.250
 that drives me on again 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.700
 just so happy because it is the 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.440
 essence of battlefield 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.870
 we would never design so 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.580
 cologne we give tools today and you 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.620
 be the actor who has the smart 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:22.270
 we only give you the opportunity to do so 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:25.030
 I love that in battlefield 4 there is 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:27.340
 with dannecker irish and pack a new one 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:34.030
 sport but what is out of the bathroom 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:35.560
 We did not have the company 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.450
 recently a postcard from helga 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.220
 get free 

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:41.080
 I do not know, I think they are 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.220
 everyone went to the monastery for themselves 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.830
 auszuholen the future 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.810
 We all love her. I like everything 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:49.420
 the style of bad company and who knows 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:51.100
 What the future brings at the moment we are 

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:56.370
 but difficult to deal with bf four 

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:56.370
 reitman up in battlefield 4 6
