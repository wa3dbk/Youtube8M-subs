00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.250

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.260
 the numbers with the pokemon but I what 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.010
 I say to see infinity 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:14.730
 infinite is a number would not be an end 10 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:16.920
 69 1 all all the numbers will 8 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:20.520
 well really my favorite number is the 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.890
 7 but since there is not 7 I will say the 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.450
 69 because pop because in my second 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.880
 favorite number obviously there are these 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:33.120
 69 to see what you want to study teaching 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:37.020
 math I still do not know anything at all 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:40.710
 chemistry aeronautical engineering fuck already 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.479
 that there are things to answer but only 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.280
 sale and 6 still do not know not the truth is 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.710
 that I've always liked the subject 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.170
 of teaching to teach children of 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.479
 done you know that I started a degree 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.130
 superior of infant school for 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.450
 then get into college and 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.979
 do teaching or do something 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.690
 related to teaching you know that 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.010
 same as I like what I said a lot of 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.900
 times so teaching is what most 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.330
 I like it so I'm going to put teaching 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.090
 because mathematics is good for me but 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.220
 I do not like it as much as to then give 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.899
 classes or being a mathematician 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.700
 I do not know yet because I know because I know 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.560
 I want to do teaching anything 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.410
 now I do not know anything because I'm doing 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.760
 good or youtube but not bearish 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.440
 basically because chemistry and then the 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.290
 another one I do not like so the teaching 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.680
 where does your pokemon come from? 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.420
 where your pokemon comes from with your favorite 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.629
 I want to say do not say I end of a 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:34.409
 laboratory of an experiment of a 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:36.750
 Island of many attempts of the man flush 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.129
 that chuck and from a house who has made 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.019
 this test is here the fact that 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.989
 noventero of the age to see where 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.489
 comes your pokemon that pokémon will end 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.049
 I'm going to put a lab there because 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.970
 I have no idea 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:52.049
 in order of a laboratory it is worth how many 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.879
 years you have 50-60 has not been born yet I think 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:57.930
 that here who has done this test gave 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:03:01.590
 test thanks less than 10 20 30 10 20 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.689
 30 40 ok I'm between 10 20 20 30 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.329
 good and put 10 20 because although I have 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:09.720
 20 years I make them comply so 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:12.200
 10 20 there is for how much the game of 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:16.340
 pokémon have played 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:20.060
 all are those of adventure all of 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.099
 tablecloth no idea all of laptop 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.470
 and he's never played pokemon but he's 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:26.450
 doing the test to jamal or kate to whom 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.489
 it will put that I shit on the tail for it 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.140
 it really plays all but not though 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.630
 I have not passed them all, yes, it is 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.010
 true that I have played each and every one 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.840
 of the Pokémon games as much as 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.640
 pokemon channel like all games 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.870
 pokemon that have come out in Spain 'eye 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.610
 because there are some Pokémon games that 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.110
 I think they are exclusive to Japan but 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.819
 obviously if they do not count so I'm going 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.160
 to put all the ones that have come in 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:50.380
 Spain so all of Spain is worth 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.380
 how many saints have you left in your life 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:59.320

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.400

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.620
