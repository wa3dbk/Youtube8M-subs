00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:31.830

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:34.440
 camshaft and camshafts ones we have in 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:38.250

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:45.030
 aural 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:50.340
 camshaft and took them to the repair along with 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:55.910

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:31.150
 look bed 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:33.490
 our beds are all smooth too 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:39.760
 smooth 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:39.760
 also no zagirov or abrasions anything 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:57.160
 that is, the principle of this repair was 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:04:02.770
 on the bed here on these here on the dust 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.400
 aluminum for aluminum on the lid these 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:08.740
 yoke 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:13.540
 also tried aluminum after that 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:22.200
 al plumes polished shafts polished 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:30.190
 shafts and under this size shafts already 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:34.330
 sharpened 3 all the beds that is dressed 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:38.080
 question cover wore everything so here are the covers 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:40.919
 and more camshaft that is all 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:45.419
 have you got all this chili 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:49.620
 after that we got the perfect 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:54.750
 the head can be said almost new 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.750
 that is, I consider this repair 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:04.710
 justified new head we will have 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:08.790
 probably cost about 30 or even more 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:12.250
 stuffy head around 15 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:16.780
 but you still need to find her to 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:22.390
 good condition what to do it very 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:25.680
 hard well I think we cost little 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:30.970
 blood 8000 rubles 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:35.340
 I do not think that this is such a big money 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.340
 for such a repair 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:46.660
 after we assemble the valve at 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:53.610
 three valve change caps we will 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:53.610
 install this head on the engine 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:01.240
