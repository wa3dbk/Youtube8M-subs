00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
looks a little weird but it's okay I'll

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.270 
looks a little weird but it's okay I'll
show<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.670> bridge<00:01:02.910> later<00:01:03.210> but<00:01:03.949> if<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.100> see

show you the bridge later but if you see
up<00:01:05.519> here<00:01:08.479> see<00:01:09.479> these<00:01:09.689> are<00:01:09.900> redstone<00:01:10.439> lamps

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
right here and the way the reason it

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.039 
right here and the way the reason it
looks<00:01:14.220> weird<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:14.670> because<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.750> native

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
looks weird is because the the native

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.280 
looks weird is because the the native
texture<00:01:16.380> packing<00:01:16.740> this<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:18.020> weird<00:01:19.020> looking

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
texture packing this is weird looking

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.340

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
but um alright so this is the redstone

but um alright so this is the redstone
lamp<00:01:22.530> right<00:01:22.710> here<00:01:23.509> this<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.720> lever<00:01:25.020> and

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.709 
and off so it does work it just doesn't
look<00:02:02.340> right<00:02:02.430> because<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:03.149> have<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.450> native

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
look right because I have the native

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.060 
look right because I have the native
texture<00:02:03.990> pack<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.439> think<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.740> only<00:02:04.860> way<00:02:05.009> to

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
texture pack and I think the only way to

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.560 
texture pack and I think the only way to
get<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.340> other<00:02:05.460> one<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:06.060> root<00:02:06.360> your<00:02:06.540> device

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
get the other one is to root your device

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.800 
get the other one is to root your device
and<00:02:07.170> I'm<00:02:08.069> not<00:02:09.030> doing<00:02:09.300> that

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
and I'm not doing that

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.250 
and I'm not doing that
so<00:02:10.800> over<00:02:11.790> here<00:02:12.060> like<00:02:12.510> I<00:02:12.630> said<00:02:12.840> there's<00:02:13.050> also

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
so over here like I said there's also

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.050 
so over here like I said there's also
the<00:02:13.560> redstone<00:02:14.010> lamp<00:02:14.250> that's<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.730> forth<00:02:15.000> thing

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
the redstone lamp that's the forth thing

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.449 
the redstone lamp that's the forth thing
and<00:02:15.480> that's<00:02:16.200> kind<00:02:16.530> of<00:02:16.590> broken<00:02:16.860> a<00:02:17.069> little<00:02:17.220> bit

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
and that's kind of broken a little bit

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.900 
and that's kind of broken a little bit
because<00:02:17.790> when<00:02:18.120> you<00:02:18.209> use<00:02:18.480> it<00:02:19.490> everything<00:02:20.490> stays

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
because when you use it everything stays

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.940 
because when you use it everything stays
on<00:02:21.180> even<00:02:21.569> if<00:02:21.660> you<00:02:21.780> destroy<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.380> redstone

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
on even if you destroy the redstone

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.559 
on even if you destroy the redstone
torch<00:02:22.980> so<00:02:23.730> let's<00:02:24.090> go<00:02:24.150> ahead<00:02:24.209> and<00:02:24.360> put<00:02:24.480> this

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
torch so let's go ahead and put this

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.000 
torch so let's go ahead and put this
down<00:02:25.760> let<00:02:26.760> me<00:02:26.850> see<00:02:27.030> right<00:02:27.180> there<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:28.860> red

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
down let me see right there the red

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.309 
down let me see right there the red
stones<00:02:29.280> on<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:29.850> dust<00:02:30.090> is<00:02:30.239> on<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.840> redstone

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
stones on the dust is on the redstone

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.270 
stones on the dust is on the redstone
lamp<00:02:31.500> is<00:02:31.770> on<00:02:32.010> but<00:02:32.880> when<00:02:33.239> I<00:02:33.270> believe<00:02:34.110> it<00:02:34.290> it

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
lamp is on but when I believe it it

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.880 
lamp is on but when I believe it it
stays<00:02:35.610> on<00:02:35.819> even<00:02:36.720> if<00:02:36.810> I<00:02:36.900> turn<00:02:37.170> off<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.470> redstone

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
stays on even if I turn off the redstone

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.120 
stays on even if I turn off the redstone
dust<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:39.000> first<00:02:39.239> one<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:40.440> second<00:02:40.830> one<00:02:40.860> the

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
dust the first one the second one the

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.330 
dust the first one the second one the
redstone<00:02:41.580> lamp<00:02:41.850> still<00:02:42.120> stays<00:02:42.360> on<00:02:43.070> so<00:02:44.070> that's

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
redstone lamp still stays on so that's

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.190 
redstone lamp still stays on so that's
it's<00:02:44.790> a<00:02:44.880> little<00:02:45.090> bit<00:02:45.180> broken<00:02:45.420> but<00:02:45.570> like<00:02:46.050> I<00:02:46.140> said

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
it's a little bit broken but like I said

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.050 
it's a little bit broken but like I said
this<00:02:46.470> is<00:02:46.620> in<00:02:46.769> like<00:02:47.040> alpha<00:02:47.519> or<00:02:47.670> beta<00:02:47.790> or

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
this is in like alpha or beta or

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.420 
this is in like alpha or beta or
something<00:02:48.330> like<00:02:48.450> that<00:02:48.660> so<00:02:48.989> it's<00:02:49.890> not<00:02:50.040> complete

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
something like that so it's not complete

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.360 
something like that so it's not complete
but<00:02:51.590> it<00:02:52.590> does<00:02:52.860> go<00:02:53.130> up<00:02:53.390> block<00:02:54.390> so<00:02:55.190> see<00:02:56.190> right

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
but it does go up block so see right

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.830 
but it does go up block so see right
here<00:02:56.700> I<00:02:56.910> have<00:02:57.590> another<00:02:58.590> lever<00:02:59.069> and<00:02:59.630> I've<00:03:00.630> got

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
here I have another lever and I've got

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.070 
here I have another lever and I've got
the<00:03:00.959> redstone<00:03:01.380> going<00:03:01.650> all<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:02.010> way<00:03:02.040> up<00:03:02.310> to

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
the redstone going all the way up to

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.820 
the redstone going all the way up to
this<00:03:04.080> section<00:03:04.530> right<00:03:04.650> here<00:03:06.440> if<00:03:07.440> you<00:03:07.560> see<00:03:07.709> right

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
this section right here if you see right

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.620 
this section right here if you see right
there<00:03:07.890> it's<00:03:08.160> got<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.459> four<00:03:09.000> blocks<00:03:09.300> in<00:03:09.540> the

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
there it's got the four blocks in the

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.720 
there it's got the four blocks in the
corner<00:03:09.989> that's<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.920> design<00:03:11.250> because<00:03:11.550> it's

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
corner that's the design because it's

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.840 
corner that's the design because it's
the<00:03:12.060> redstone<00:03:12.600> lamps<00:03:12.840> are<00:03:12.959> turned<00:03:13.200> off<00:03:13.730> so<00:03:14.730> if

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
the redstone lamps are turned off so if

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.259 
the redstone lamps are turned off so if
you<00:03:14.940> go<00:03:15.120> over<00:03:15.450> here<00:03:16.079> where<00:03:16.530> is<00:03:16.680> it<00:03:16.829> there<00:03:17.010> it<00:03:17.040> is

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
you go over here where is it there it is

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.229 
you go over here where is it there it is
and<00:03:18.269> just<00:03:18.600> flip<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.079> switch<00:03:19.970> then<00:03:20.970> those<00:03:21.150> are

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
and just flip the switch then those are

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:22.789 
and just flip the switch then those are
gonna<00:03:21.329> light<00:03:21.540> up<00:03:21.570> and<00:03:21.989> it's<00:03:22.260> gonna<00:03:22.350> have<00:03:22.590> more

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
gonna light up and it's gonna have more

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.590 
gonna light up and it's gonna have more
of<00:03:22.860> a<00:03:22.980> kind<00:03:23.130> of<00:03:23.220> a<00:03:23.340> Mario<00:03:23.670> block<00:03:24.000> look<00:03:24.269> to<00:03:24.420> it

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
of a kind of a Mario block look to it

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.039 
of a kind of a Mario block look to it
there<00:03:25.530> you<00:03:25.620> go<00:03:25.799> and<00:03:26.450> I<00:03:27.450> reading<00:03:27.690> that<00:03:27.720> all<00:03:27.959> the

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
there you go and I reading that all the

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.470 
there you go and I reading that all the
way<00:03:28.140> underneath<00:03:28.470> there<00:03:28.860> and<00:03:29.190> up<00:03:29.880> here<00:03:30.150> you<00:03:30.239> see

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
way underneath there and up here you see

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:39.560 
way underneath there and up here you see
the<00:03:30.840> redstone<00:03:31.500> dust<00:03:31.890> is<00:03:32.130> on<00:03:32.310> I<00:03:35.630> say<00:03:38.450> come<00:03:39.450> on

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
the redstone dust is on I say come on

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.849 
the redstone dust is on I say come on
there<00:03:40.049> we<00:03:40.109> go<00:03:41.959> so<00:03:42.959> if<00:03:43.049> I<00:03:43.170> were<00:03:43.230> to<00:03:43.350> break<00:03:43.620> one<00:03:43.829> of

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
there we go so if I were to break one of

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.789 
there we go so if I were to break one of
these<00:03:43.980> redstone<00:03:44.489> dust<00:03:44.640> down<00:03:44.880> here<00:03:45.560> they<00:03:46.560> still

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
these redstone dust down here they still

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.630 
these redstone dust down here they still
stay<00:03:47.010> on<00:03:47.040> now<00:03:47.780> so<00:03:48.780> that's<00:03:49.590> kind<00:03:49.980> of<00:03:50.070> broken<00:03:50.340> too

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
stay on now so that's kind of broken too

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.720 
stay on now so that's kind of broken too
but<00:03:51.000> that's<00:03:51.510> okay<00:03:51.840> because<00:03:52.130> if<00:03:53.130> I<00:03:54.920> if<00:03:55.920> I<00:03:56.250> turn

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
but that's okay because if I if I turn

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.610 
but that's okay because if I if I turn
off<00:03:56.880> the<00:03:57.150> lever<00:03:57.359> down<00:03:57.600> there<00:03:57.810> then<00:03:58.140> it'll<00:03:58.470> turn

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
off the lever down there then it'll turn

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.270 
off the lever down there then it'll turn
all<00:03:58.769> the<00:03:58.890> leaves<00:03:59.010> off<00:03:59.190> also<00:04:00.030> if<00:04:00.359> you<00:04:00.510> add<00:04:00.540> or

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
all the leaves off also if you add or

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.289 
all the leaves off also if you add or
subtract<00:04:02.280> something<00:04:02.579> it<00:04:02.940> doesn't<00:04:03.090> really

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
subtract something it doesn't really

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.740 
subtract something it doesn't really
affect<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:03.989> the<00:04:04.410> circuit<00:04:04.799> which<00:04:05.790> is<00:04:06.030> a<00:04:06.060> little

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
affect the the circuit which is a little

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.460 
affect the the circuit which is a little
weird<00:04:06.780> but<00:04:07.260> it's<00:04:08.060> it's<00:04:09.060> understandable<00:04:09.989> your

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
weird but it's it's understandable your

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.099 
weird but it's it's understandable your
program<00:04:10.980> and<00:04:11.100> stuff<00:04:11.280> like<00:04:11.430> that<00:04:11.690> to<00:04:12.690> come<00:04:12.840> in<00:04:12.959> a

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
program and stuff like that to come in a

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:14.840 
program and stuff like that to come in a
bug<00:04:13.320> because<00:04:13.440> it<00:04:13.620> has<00:04:13.739> to<00:04:13.859> be<00:04:13.980> like<00:04:14.190> all<00:04:14.670> the

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
bug because it has to be like all the

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.190 
bug because it has to be like all the
different<00:04:15.180> variables<00:04:17.030> so<00:04:18.030> and<00:04:18.570> turn<00:04:18.870> this<00:04:18.989> off

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
different variables so and turn this off

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.680 
different variables so and turn this off
okay<00:04:20.099> there<00:04:20.609> you<00:04:20.640> go<00:04:20.729> and<00:04:21.000> then<00:04:21.269> turn<00:04:21.539> it<00:04:21.570> back

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
okay there you go and then turn it back

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.360 
okay there you go and then turn it back
on<00:04:22.010> everything<00:04:23.010> should

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
on everything should

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.070 
on everything should
fine<00:04:24.110> yeah<00:04:25.110> see<00:04:25.940> the<00:04:26.940> block<00:04:27.180> is<00:04:27.330> backs<00:04:27.570> on<00:04:27.810> the

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
fine yeah see the block is backs on the

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.129 
fine yeah see the block is backs on the
redstone<00:04:28.590> lamps<00:04:29.130> are<00:04:29.250> back<00:04:29.370> on<00:04:29.520> now<00:04:30.150> this

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
redstone lamps are back on now this

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:32.780 
redstone lamps are back on now this
right<00:04:31.380> here<00:04:31.440> this<00:04:31.979> is<00:04:32.250> one<00:04:32.370> of<00:04:32.400> my<00:04:32.520> favorite

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
right here this is one of my favorite

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.400 
right here this is one of my favorite
little<00:04:32.910> contraptions<00:04:33.540> it's<00:04:33.750> just<00:04:33.960> whoa<00:04:34.139> oh

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
little contraptions it's just whoa oh

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.430 
little contraptions it's just whoa oh
wow<00:04:34.800> I'm<00:04:34.949> on<00:04:35.070> fire<00:04:35.600> this<00:04:36.600> is<00:04:36.720> one<00:04:36.870> of<00:04:36.900> the

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
wow I'm on fire this is one of the

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.930 
wow I'm on fire this is one of the
muddle<00:04:37.650> of<00:04:37.800> contraptions<00:04:38.400> my<00:04:38.580> favorite

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
muddle of contraptions my favorite

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.980 
muddle of contraptions my favorite
things<00:04:39.180> is<00:04:39.419> to<00:04:39.810> lure<00:04:40.800> like<00:04:41.160> mobs<00:04:41.850> over<00:04:42.449> a<00:04:42.479> thing

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
things is to lure like mobs over a thing

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.469 
things is to lure like mobs over a thing
lava<00:04:43.350> that<00:04:43.740> set<00:04:44.669> up<00:04:44.790> like<00:04:44.970> this

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
lava that set up like this

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:50.300 
lava that set up like this
and<00:04:46.370> put<00:04:47.370> the<00:04:47.520> trapdoors<00:04:48.210> on<00:04:48.419> it<00:04:48.600> and<00:04:49.190> when<00:04:50.190> you

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
and put the trapdoors on it and when you

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.490 
and put the trapdoors on it and when you
have<00:04:50.400> a<00:04:50.430> trapdoor<00:04:50.699> that's<00:04:51.449> activated<00:04:52.110> next<00:04:52.440> to

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
have a trapdoor that's activated next to

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.210 
have a trapdoor that's activated next to
RIT's<00:04:52.710> or<00:04:52.949> redstone<00:04:53.699> next<00:04:53.970> to<00:04:54.210> a<00:04:54.510> trapdoor<00:04:55.220> it

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
RIT's or redstone next to a trapdoor it

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.659 
RIT's or redstone next to a trapdoor it
lifts<00:04:56.669> it<00:04:56.760> up<00:04:56.940> so<00:04:57.330> I<00:04:57.830> set<00:04:58.830> this<00:04:58.979> up<00:04:59.039> and<00:04:59.520> it

00:04:59.659 --> 00:04:59.669 
lifts it up so I set this up and it

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:02.689 
lifts it up so I set this up and it
doesn't<00:04:59.940> work<00:05:01.100> normally<00:05:02.100> what<00:05:02.220> happens<00:05:02.520> is

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 
doesn't work normally what happens is

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:05.210 
doesn't work normally what happens is
the<00:05:02.880> trapdoor<00:05:03.240> opens<00:05:03.660> up<00:05:03.870> flips<00:05:04.830> up<00:05:05.010> and

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
the trapdoor opens up flips up and

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.219 
the trapdoor opens up flips up and
whatever's<00:05:05.760> on<00:05:06.000> top<00:05:06.270> of<00:05:06.479> it

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
whatever's on top of it

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:10.219 
whatever's on top of it
falls<00:05:07.949> down<00:05:08.070> or<00:05:08.550> the<00:05:08.910> trapdoor<00:05:09.510> goes<00:05:09.750> down<00:05:09.960> not

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
falls down or the trapdoor goes down not

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:11.840 
falls down or the trapdoor goes down not
really<00:05:10.410> sure<00:05:10.620> which<00:05:10.740> one<00:05:10.979> doesn't<00:05:11.760> really

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
really sure which one doesn't really

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.580 
really sure which one doesn't really
matter<00:05:12.150> but<00:05:12.510> the<00:05:12.660> point<00:05:12.870> is<00:05:12.990> it<00:05:13.199> doesn't<00:05:13.350> work

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
matter but the point is it doesn't work

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.409 
matter but the point is it doesn't work
and<00:05:13.919> I<00:05:14.039> tried<00:05:14.250> to<00:05:14.340> play<00:05:14.520> with<00:05:14.669> it<00:05:14.789> but<00:05:14.940> it<00:05:15.210> still

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
and I tried to play with it but it still

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:18.980 
and I tried to play with it but it still
didn't<00:05:15.600> work<00:05:15.660> so<00:05:16.789> that<00:05:17.789> makes<00:05:17.970> me<00:05:18.120> sad<00:05:18.300> it

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
didn't work so that makes me sad it

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.129 
didn't work so that makes me sad it
makes<00:05:19.110> me<00:05:19.260> a<00:05:19.289> little<00:05:19.410> sad<00:05:20.030> but<00:05:21.030> overall<00:05:21.720> it

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:22.139 
makes me a little sad but overall it

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:23.629 
makes me a little sad but overall it
looks<00:05:22.410> like<00:05:22.560> it's<00:05:22.979> shaping<00:05:23.130> up<00:05:23.370> pretty<00:05:23.430> good

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 
looks like it's shaping up pretty good

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:26.600 
looks like it's shaping up pretty good
and<00:05:24.320> hopefully<00:05:25.320> I'll<00:05:25.530> have<00:05:25.680> an<00:05:25.919> update<00:05:26.280> to<00:05:26.460> it

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
and hopefully I'll have an update to it

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.700 
and hopefully I'll have an update to it
to<00:05:26.760> where<00:05:27.139> things<00:05:28.139> like<00:05:28.349> that<00:05:28.530> will<00:05:28.680> work

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
to where things like that will work

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.730 
to where things like that will work
better<00:05:29.039> and<00:05:29.400> the<00:05:29.910> redstone<00:05:30.419> when<00:05:31.349> you<00:05:31.470> break

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
better and the redstone when you break

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.920 
better and the redstone when you break
it<00:05:31.950> it'll<00:05:32.370> actually<00:05:32.490> turn<00:05:33.180> off<00:05:33.389> the<00:05:33.539> circuit

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
it it'll actually turn off the circuit

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.100 
it it'll actually turn off the circuit
and<00:05:34.110> or<00:05:34.860> everything<00:05:35.550> attached<00:05:35.849> to<00:05:36.030> it<00:05:36.180> I<00:05:36.389> tried

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
and or everything attached to it I tried

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.500 
and or everything attached to it I tried
the<00:05:37.320> stacking<00:05:38.310> you<00:05:38.639> know<00:05:38.760> like<00:05:39.000> you<00:05:39.180> normally

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
the stacking you know like you normally

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.620 
the stacking you know like you normally
put<00:05:40.190> redstone<00:05:41.190> torch<00:05:41.970> like<00:05:42.210> right<00:05:42.389> there<00:05:42.599> and

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
put redstone torch like right there and

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.610 
put redstone torch like right there and
then<00:05:43.340> you<00:05:44.340> know<00:05:44.400> you<00:05:44.580> can<00:05:44.789> I<00:05:44.820> have<00:05:45.060> a<00:05:45.510> block<00:05:46.380> or

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
then you know you can I have a block or

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.430 
then you know you can I have a block or
whatever<00:05:46.800> there<00:05:47.539> and<00:05:48.539> then<00:05:48.870> a<00:05:49.020> redstone<00:05:49.320> torch

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
whatever there and then a redstone torch

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.120 
whatever there and then a redstone torch
there<00:05:49.919> and<00:05:50.430> it<00:05:51.060> kind<00:05:51.270> of<00:05:51.389> makes<00:05:52.050> a<00:05:52.169> little<00:05:52.349> kind

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
there and it kind of makes a little kind

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.460 
there and it kind of makes a little kind
of<00:05:53.220> mini<00:05:53.400> circuit<00:05:53.639> on/off<00:05:54.210> circuit<00:05:54.599> and<00:05:54.840> it's

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
of mini circuit on/off circuit and it's

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.200 
of mini circuit on/off circuit and it's
a<00:05:55.560> way<00:05:55.710> to<00:05:55.770> you<00:05:56.340> know<00:05:56.430> kind<00:05:56.639> of<00:05:56.729> stack<00:05:57.000> your

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
a way to you know kind of stack your

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.020 
a way to you know kind of stack your
redstone<00:05:57.740> up<00:05:58.740> to<00:05:59.130> like<00:05:59.340> a<00:05:59.370> higher<00:05:59.639> place

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.030 
redstone up to like a higher place

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.330 
redstone up to like a higher place
without<00:06:00.690> like<00:06:00.960> building<00:06:01.800> a<00:06:01.860> big<00:06:02.070> thing<00:06:02.310> like

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
without like building a big thing like

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.080 
without like building a big thing like
that<00:06:02.729> it<00:06:03.479> saves<00:06:03.720> a<00:06:03.840> lot<00:06:03.900> of<00:06:04.050> space<00:06:04.669> but<00:06:05.669> I<00:06:05.729> tried

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
that it saves a lot of space but I tried

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:07.760 
that it saves a lot of space but I tried
doing<00:06:06.240> that<00:06:06.479> and<00:06:06.840> didn't<00:06:07.199> work<00:06:07.349> out<00:06:07.470> very<00:06:07.560> well

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770 
doing that and didn't work out very well

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.180 
doing that and didn't work out very well
either<00:06:08.070> so<00:06:09.320> hopefully<00:06:10.320> that'll<00:06:10.590> be<00:06:10.740> fixed<00:06:11.070> to

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.190 
either so hopefully that'll be fixed to
