00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.050
 so hi everyone today this is my 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:19.029
 first business tutorial good saw that I 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.980
 learned since I have some I know myself in 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.460
 several trades I told myself saw that 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.660
 I learned why not want to learn 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.910
 is called reciprocity 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.279
 it was the minute culture of such 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.360
 frauds so today I'm here 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:36.309
 for tailoring from level 1 to 60 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.860
 level 1 60 why because as soon as 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:41.110
 we go to level 60 we have to do it 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.980
 something else to hope because from 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:48.969
 there the caps level that decide boxes 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:53.710
 no longer works so level 60 it's 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:55.270
 another step for the xp of du du 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.850
 job then what to do 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.170
 to a level of tailor January 1 60 then 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.430
 already you have to buy the manual 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.280
 of the tailor a my bag I believe that 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.539
 you doubt it a little 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.460
 you also have to buy seeds from 

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:07.240
 sesame 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.800
 so why sesame seeds 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.619
 because that's what allows kraft 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:15.159
 ku items so see his server that 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.840
 costs 5000 and I tell you live for 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.040
 pub from level 1 to 60 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.240
 you will have to buy some 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.470
 exactly 100 two-way lots I see if 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.210
 I made myself well understood 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.740
 we were a bit hard to say in fact he 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.780
 you have to buy wholesale 10 thousand 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.729
 Sesame seeds 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.170
 exactly ten thousand and you will be level 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:39.880
 60 so there for example it cost you 5 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:43.750
 500 miles plus piau feathers that 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.549
 piou piou piou people or not only 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.810
 waiter it costs 7 me then you take 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:48.220
 the feathers that cost the cheapest a 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.649
 meaning by making close to complaints 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.390
 different so it starts to 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:53.860
 to do too much 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.290
 take blues from the reds of the greens 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.890
 purple ideas and italian 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.329
 of the French unveils so you take 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.210
 the least expensive girl doing wrong 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.860
 jimmy illegally safra 700000 camin to 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.019
 roughly if they still cost 7000 cases 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.799
 so I have 700 camin miles plus 500 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:10.799
 miles from cammas did how much 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.030
 yes, that's a million two bravo 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.250

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.900

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.130

 so I have kraft and a see up is 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.660
 young and kraft is a bit close 20 that's me 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.860
 made a loan of 200 xp so that you 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.210
 take a couple of hours and it does not 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.010
 It does not cost you a lot 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.570
 cost a million two and then you 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.130
 could be quiet if you 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.440
 do for example dungeons like the 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:26.400
 nolwenn dungeon that allows kraft and 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.660
 items that can subsequently you 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.580
 will do a lot of kabal if you want 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.880
 crushed but that's good I would say that more 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.200
 late in kama tutorials that I 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.530
 plan to launch soon so that's it 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.810
 so basically in summary to be 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.440

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:46.590

 buy the eel and son and you kraft 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.800
 and ku items in bulk mass 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.850
 mass it will take you to craft in 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:57.030
 all ten miles cap or 10000 caps tube 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.530

 frankly it's not at all my in 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.130
