00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
doing this because on when Xbox did it

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.830 
doing this because on when Xbox did it
was<00:05:24.430> kind<00:05:24.669> of<00:05:24.760> everyone<00:05:25.120> all<00:05:25.270> the<00:05:25.390> gamers<00:05:25.600> are

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
was kind of everyone all the gamers are

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.060 
was kind of everyone all the gamers are
kind<00:05:25.990> of<00:05:26.020> like<00:05:26.140> what<00:05:26.350> is<00:05:26.440> this<00:05:26.590> is<00:05:26.740> kind<00:05:27.040> of

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
kind of like what is this is kind of

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.680 
kind of like what is this is kind of
just<00:05:27.220> like<00:05:27.250> a<00:05:27.340> dumb<00:05:27.550> gimmick<00:05:27.850> like<00:05:27.880> Xbox<00:05:28.419> on

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
just like a dumb gimmick like Xbox on

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.270 
just like a dumb gimmick like Xbox on
yeah<00:05:29.230> but<00:05:29.500> I<00:05:29.530> get<00:05:29.710> that<00:05:29.800> some<00:05:29.950> people<00:05:30.190> will

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
yeah but I get that some people will

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.070 
yeah but I get that some people will
like<00:05:30.460> it<00:05:30.610> and<00:05:30.700> hopefully<00:05:30.910> the<00:05:31.450> most<00:05:31.750> important

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
like it and hopefully the most important

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.680 
like it and hopefully the most important
thing<00:05:32.200> is<00:05:32.380> if<00:05:32.500> it<00:05:32.620> recognizes<00:05:32.950> your<00:05:33.370> voice

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
thing is if it recognizes your voice

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.400 
thing is if it recognizes your voice
correctly<00:05:34.690> if<00:05:34.780> it<00:05:34.870> recognizes<00:05:35.080> your<00:05:35.350> voice

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:35.410 
correctly if it recognizes your voice

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:36.840 
correctly if it recognizes your voice
correctly<00:05:35.919> then<00:05:36.070> it's<00:05:36.190> kind<00:05:36.340> of<00:05:36.370> work<00:05:36.550> if<00:05:36.790> not

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:36.850 
correctly then it's kind of work if not

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.580 
correctly then it's kind of work if not
man<00:05:37.390> just<00:05:37.930> kind<00:05:38.050> of<00:05:38.080> a<00:05:38.169> gimmick<00:05:38.380> but<00:05:38.470> yeah

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590
