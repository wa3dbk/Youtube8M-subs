training now we're going to feel good
shape<00:00:20.189> generator<00:00:21.750> generator<00:00:22.080> is<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.410> very

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
shape generator generator is a very

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.010 
shape generator generator is a very
quick<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.250> easy<00:00:23.580> way<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:24.150> making<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.810> simple

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.020 
quick and easy way of making a simple

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.060 
quick and easy way of making a simple
shape<00:00:25.580> so<00:00:26.750> if<00:00:27.750> we<00:00:27.930> select<00:00:28.110> pictures<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.860> apply

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
shape so if we select pictures to apply

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.319 
shape so if we select pictures to apply
to<00:00:29.930> and<00:00:30.930> then<00:00:31.079> use<00:00:31.230> ok<00:00:31.790> we<00:00:32.790> can<00:00:32.820> see<00:00:33.030> we're

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
to and then use ok we can see we're

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.870 
to and then use ok we can see we're
going<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.510> be<00:00:33.600> applying<00:00:33.660> these<00:00:34.050> pictures<00:00:34.880> our

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
going to be applying these pictures our

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.150 
going to be applying these pictures our
shake<00:00:36.059> generator<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:37.050> always<00:00:37.470> soft<00:00:37.649> key<00:00:37.860> at

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
shake generator is always soft key at

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.370 
shake generator is always soft key at
the<00:00:38.250> root<00:00:38.430> program<00:00:38.790> menu<00:00:39.050> so<00:00:40.050> when<00:00:40.140> we<00:00:40.200> hit<00:00:40.350> it

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:40.380 
the root program menu so when we hit it

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.209 
the root program menu so when we hit it
is<00:00:41.219> takes<00:00:41.520> into<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.910> shape<00:00:42.090> generator<00:00:42.450> menu

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
is takes into the shape generator menu

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:45.680 
is takes into the shape generator menu
and<00:00:44.219> first<00:00:44.460> thing<00:00:44.640> we<00:00:44.700> need<00:00:44.790> to<00:00:44.850> do<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.420> play

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
and first thing we need to do is play

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.939 
and first thing we need to do is play
back<00:00:45.839> shape<00:00:46.079> because<00:00:46.469> it's<00:00:46.620> carrying<00:00:46.829> nothing

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
back shape because it's carrying nothing

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:49.639 
back shape because it's carrying nothing
to<00:00:47.250> do<00:00:47.339> with<00:00:47.460> them<00:00:47.690> so<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:49.230> can't<00:00:49.379> play<00:00:49.469> back<00:00:49.620> a

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
to do with them so you can't play back a

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.090 
to do with them so you can't play back a
shape<00:00:50.000> it<00:00:51.000> lists<00:00:51.359> all<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.660> shape<00:00:51.989> files<00:00:52.440> that

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
shape it lists all the shape files that

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.540 
shape it lists all the shape files that
being<00:00:53.309> loaded<00:00:53.429> into<00:00:53.609> well<00:00:55.399> circle<00:00:56.399> is

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
being loaded into well circle is

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.779 
being loaded into well circle is
movement<00:00:56.820> 1<00:00:57.089> so<00:00:57.749> if<00:00:57.809> i<00:00:57.899> choose<00:00:58.050> circle<00:00:58.640> we<00:00:59.640> look

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
movement 1 so if i choose circle we look

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.889 
movement 1 so if i choose circle we look
at<00:00:59.909> the<00:00:59.999> screen<00:01:00.239> they<00:01:01.050> doing<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.320> circle<00:01:02.839> now<00:01:03.839> to

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
at the screen they doing a circle now to

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.290 
at the screen they doing a circle now to
change<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.500> parameters<00:01:04.980> of<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.159> shape<00:01:05.339> i<00:01:05.640> can

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
change the parameters of the shape i can

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.530 
change the parameters of the shape i can
use<00:01:06.540> these<00:01:07.260> two<00:01:07.500> options<00:01:07.800> here<00:01:08.330> set<00:01:09.330> the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
use these two options here set the

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.750 
use these two options here set the
wheels<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.170> spread<00:01:10.530> or<00:01:10.740> set<00:01:11.190> to<00:01:11.340> seismic

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
wheels to the spread or set to seismic

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.300 
wheels to the spread or set to seismic
bead<00:01:12.229> i'm<00:01:13.229> going<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.470> choose<00:01:13.650> size<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.159> speed

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
bead i'm going to choose size and speed

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.080 
bead i'm going to choose size and speed
first<00:01:15.320> size<00:01:16.320> increases<00:01:17.070> or<00:01:17.460> decreases<00:01:17.610> the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
first size increases or decreases the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.120 
first size increases or decreases the
size<00:01:18.120> of<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.450> shape<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:19.620> it's<00:01:19.770> look<00:01:19.920> at<00:01:20.040> the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
size of the shape so it's look at the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.610 
size of the shape so it's look at the
screen<00:01:20.370> and<00:01:21.240> I'm<00:01:21.330> putting<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.690> size<00:01:21.900> up<00:01:22.110> its

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 
screen and I'm putting the size up its

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.040 
screen and I'm putting the size up its
getting<00:01:22.830> bigger<00:01:23.390> if<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.510> turn<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.840> wheel

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
getting bigger if I turn the wheel

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.600 
getting bigger if I turn the wheel
anti-clockwise<00:01:26.450> they<00:01:27.450> get<00:01:27.630> smaller<00:01:28.490> if<00:01:29.490> you

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
anti-clockwise they get smaller if you

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.520 
anti-clockwise they get smaller if you
do<00:01:29.790> 20<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.050> slices<00:01:31.410> none<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:32.010> shape<00:01:32.220> stops

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.660 

speed<00:01:36.190> also<00:01:37.090> affects<00:01:37.570> fixtures<00:01:38.280> as<00:01:39.280> we<00:01:39.520> turn

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
speed also affects fixtures as we turn

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.840 
speed also affects fixtures as we turn
in<00:01:39.760> the<00:01:39.820> clockwise<00:01:40.060> and<00:01:40.840> speed<00:01:41.080> increases<00:01:41.850> now

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
in the clockwise and speed increases now

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.070 
in the clockwise and speed increases now
the<00:01:42.909> gets<00:01:43.119> to<00:01:43.210> a<00:01:43.299> point<00:01:43.330> where<00:01:43.570> your<00:01:43.780> fixtures

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
the gets to a point where your fixtures

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.230 
the gets to a point where your fixtures
can't<00:01:44.320> physically<00:01:44.830> do<00:01:45.369> the<00:01:45.520> speed<00:01:45.759> of<00:01:45.909> setting

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
can't physically do the speed of setting

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.370 
can't physically do the speed of setting
to<00:01:47.610> as<00:01:48.610> we<00:01:49.270> turn<00:01:49.450> the<00:01:49.570> wheel<00:01:49.690> and<00:01:49.900> to<00:01:50.020> clockwise

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
to as we turn the wheel and to clockwise

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.580 
to as we turn the wheel and to clockwise
and<00:01:51.040> speed<00:01:51.310> goes<00:01:51.460> down<00:01:51.990> till<00:01:52.990> it<00:01:53.110> gets<00:01:53.259> to<00:01:53.320> stop

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
and speed goes down till it gets to stop

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
and speed goes down till it gets to stop
let's<00:01:54.280> zero

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.360 

we<00:01:59.180> can<00:01:59.330> also<00:01:59.480> use<00:01:59.720> the<00:01:59.870> wheels<00:02:00.130> to<00:02:01.130> set<00:02:01.280> the

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
we can also use the wheels to set the

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.510 
we can also use the wheels to set the
spread<00:02:02.380> this<00:02:03.380> is<00:02:03.530> changing<00:02:03.980> how<00:02:04.340> many

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
spread this is changing how many

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.050 
spread this is changing how many
fixtures<00:02:04.850> the<00:02:05.030> shape<00:02:05.210> is<00:02:05.330> playing<00:02:05.540> across

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
fixtures the shape is playing across

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.719 
fixtures the shape is playing across
call<00:02:08.060> spread<00:02:08.710> is<00:02:09.710> the<00:02:09.920> number<00:02:10.190> of<00:02:10.220> fixtures

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
call spread is the number of fixtures

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.120 
call spread is the number of fixtures
the<00:02:10.940> shape<00:02:11.120> is<00:02:11.210> playing<00:02:11.420> over<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.980> weights

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
the shape is playing over the weights

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.280 
the shape is playing over the weights
esta<00:02:13.460> tu<00:02:13.640> means<00:02:14.630> it's<00:02:14.750> going<00:02:14.810> to<00:02:14.900> play<00:02:15.080> cross

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
esta tu means it's going to play cross

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.140 
esta tu means it's going to play cross
two<00:02:15.470> fixtures<00:02:15.770> and<00:02:16.100> then<00:02:16.640> start<00:02:16.940> repeating

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
two fixtures and then start repeating

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.430 
two fixtures and then start repeating
again<00:02:19.210> fine<00:02:20.210> spread<00:02:20.570> is<00:02:20.720> water<00:02:20.960> in<00:02:21.050> degree

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
again fine spread is water in degree

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.210 
again fine spread is water in degree
values<00:02:22.600> so<00:02:23.600> it's<00:02:23.990> now<00:02:24.200> changing<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.950> degree

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
values so it's now changing the degree

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.180 
values so it's now changing the degree
value<00:02:25.520> within<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:26.000> course<00:02:26.209> spread<00:02:30.070> you<00:02:31.070> can

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
value within the course spread you can

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.650 
value within the course spread you can
play<00:02:31.280> at<00:02:31.430> Short<00:02:31.580> shape<00:02:32.000> on<00:02:32.180> top<00:02:32.209> of<00:02:32.480> each<00:02:32.510> other

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
play at Short shape on top of each other

direction<00:03:30.610> of<00:03:30.880> the<00:03:30.970> shape<00:03:31.230> so<00:03:32.230> if<00:03:32.380> I've<00:03:32.530> got<00:03:32.740> is

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
direction of the shape so if I've got is

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.650 
direction of the shape so if I've got is
anyone<00:03:33.430> in<00:03:33.520> from<00:03:33.640> left<00:03:33.760> to<00:03:33.880> right<00:03:33.970> for<00:03:34.450> dinner

anyone in from left to right for dinner
friend<00:03:34.930> if<00:03:35.140> I<00:03:35.320> change<00:03:35.590> direction<00:03:35.890> and<00:03:36.220> reverse

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
friend if I change direction and reverse

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.260 
friend if I change direction and reverse
it<00:03:36.640> so<00:03:37.240> they<00:03:37.390> from<00:03:37.540> right<00:03:37.690> to<00:03:37.810> left<00:03:38.880> now<00:03:39.880> once

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 
it so they from right to left now once

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.000 
it so they from right to left now once
i'm<00:03:40.390> proximately<00:03:40.750> I<00:03:40.810> happen<00:03:41.140> with<00:03:41.260> I<00:03:41.500> wants<00:03:41.860> a

i'm proximately I happen with I wants a
little<00:03:42.310> Q<00:03:42.690> all<00:03:43.690> I<00:03:43.720> do<00:03:43.870> is<00:03:44.200> add<00:03:44.470> with<00:03:44.620> a<00:03:44.710> normal

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
little Q all I do is add with a normal

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.720 
little Q all I do is add with a normal
cube<00:03:45.250> hit<00:03:46.000> memory<00:03:46.300> huge<00:03:47.280> choose<00:03:48.280> my<00:03:48.400> record

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
cube hit memory huge choose my record

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.290 
cube hit memory huge choose my record
mode<00:03:49.500> if<00:03:50.500> I<00:03:50.620> choose<00:03:50.830> channel<00:03:51.250> then<00:03:52.030> that<00:03:52.150> means

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
mode if I choose channel then that means

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.380 
mode if I choose channel then that means
i<00:03:52.570> can<00:03:52.780> play<00:03:52.990> the<00:03:53.170> shape<00:03:53.430> over<00:03:54.430> other<00:03:54.970> memories

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
i can play the shape over other memories

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.480 
i can play the shape over other memories
so<00:03:56.290> because<00:03:56.500> I've<00:03:56.620> just<00:03:56.650> changed<00:03:56.980> the<00:03:57.220> dimmer

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 
so because I've just changed the dimmer

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.900 
so because I've just changed the dimmer
and<00:03:57.670> the<00:03:58.360> position<00:03:59.020> values<00:03:59.830> I<00:04:00.070> could<00:04:00.760> play

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
and the position values I could play

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.390 
and the position values I could play
over<00:04:00.940> a<00:04:01.240> fixture<00:04:01.540> mode<00:04:01.810> or<00:04:02.500> channel<00:04:02.950> no<00:04:03.040> memory

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
over a fixture mode or channel no memory

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.740 
over a fixture mode or channel no memory
that<00:04:03.880> had<00:04:04.000> things<00:04:04.270> like<00:04:04.390> color<00:04:04.959> and<00:04:05.200> go<00:04:05.290> Bozak

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
that had things like color and go Bozak

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.720 
that had things like color and go Bozak
so<00:04:07.750> when<00:04:08.080> I<00:04:08.110> chose<00:04:08.320> my<00:04:08.470> boat<00:04:08.680> and<00:04:08.920> the<00:04:09.459> lean<00:04:09.640> the

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
so when I chose my boat and the lean the

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
so when I chose my boat and the lean the
future<00:04:10.030> road<00:04:10.180> I<00:04:10.590> hear<00:04:11.590> flushing<00:04:11.920> playback<00:04:12.750> and

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
future road I hear flushing playback and

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.570 
future road I hear flushing playback and
that<00:04:13.959> saved<00:04:14.200> it

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
that saved it

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.240 
that saved it
professor<00:04:16.360> clear<00:04:16.630> and<00:04:17.530> then<00:04:17.620> exit<00:04:17.980> quite<00:04:18.220> a

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
professor clear and then exit quite a

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.870 
professor clear and then exit quite a
few<00:04:18.400> generator<00:04:18.730> I<00:04:19.290> can<00:04:20.290> now<00:04:20.410> see<00:04:20.650> my<00:04:21.610> shapes

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880
