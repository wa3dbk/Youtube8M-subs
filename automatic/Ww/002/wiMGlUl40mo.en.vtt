you think the deck would adapt assuming

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:42.310 
you think the deck would adapt assuming

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
like that me honesty is at three if you

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.889 
like that me honesty is at three if you

really want to go that far into

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.410 
really want to go that far into
retrospect<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.299> things<00:02:00.299> like<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.710> but<00:02:02.420> i'm

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
retrospect and things like that but i'm

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.849 
retrospect and things like that but i'm
pretty<00:02:03.630> sure<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.020> deck<00:02:04.520> would<00:02:05.810> know<00:02:06.810> adapt<00:02:07.380> so

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:07.859 
pretty sure the deck would know adapt so

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:09.590 
pretty sure the deck would know adapt so
where<00:02:08.100> do<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.250> think<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.490> guys<00:02:08.610> would<00:02:08.910> take

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600
