them I believe the circuit is slightly
underrated<00:00:22.460> it's<00:00:22.670> constantly<00:00:23.390> living<00:00:23.869> in<00:00:24.080> the

to<00:00:52.010> induce<00:00:52.520> blooming<00:00:53.000> this<00:00:53.239> orchid<00:00:53.629> it's<00:00:53.780> just

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
to induce blooming this orchid it's just

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.160 
to induce blooming this orchid it's just
that<00:00:54.289> easy<00:00:54.610> but<00:00:55.610> some<00:00:56.090> aspects<00:00:56.600> in<00:00:56.690> its<00:00:56.840> care

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
that easy but some aspects in its care

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.369 
that easy but some aspects in its care
do<00:00:57.590> influence<00:00:58.070> a<00:00:58.280> good<00:00:58.610> flower<00:00:58.879> count<00:00:59.300> and<00:00:59.629> why

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
do influence a good flower count and why

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.470 
do influence a good flower count and why
not<00:01:00.590> a<00:01:00.620> good<00:01:00.920> flower<00:01:01.250> spike<00:01:01.640> count<00:01:02.000> because

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
not a good flower spike count because

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.150 
not a good flower spike count because
this<00:01:02.899> orchid<00:01:03.320> can<00:01:03.590> actually<00:01:03.980> produce

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.160 
this orchid can actually produce

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.450 
this orchid can actually produce
multiple<00:01:04.580> spikes<00:01:05.470> from<00:01:06.470> the<00:01:06.649> old<00:01:06.800> canes<00:01:07.160> and

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
multiple spikes from the old canes and

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.780 
multiple spikes from the old canes and
the<00:01:07.640> new<00:01:07.759> canes<00:01:08.119> and<00:01:08.479> you<00:01:08.869> can<00:01:09.050> have<00:01:09.229> multiple

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
the new canes and you can have multiple

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.700 
the new canes and you can have multiple
sprays<00:01:10.790> of<00:01:11.119> flowers<00:01:11.659> isn't<00:01:12.170> that<00:01:12.290> great

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
sprays of flowers isn't that great

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.149 
sprays of flowers isn't that great
okay<00:01:13.310> so<00:01:13.369> these<00:01:13.790> factors<00:01:14.420> are<00:01:14.600> light<00:01:15.380> water

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
okay so these factors are light water

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.450 
okay so these factors are light water
and<00:01:16.630> fertilizing<00:01:17.799> these<00:01:18.799> are<00:01:19.040> kids<00:01:19.250> enjoy

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
and fertilizing these are kids enjoy

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.340 
and fertilizing these are kids enjoy
quite<00:01:19.820> a<00:01:19.850> bit<00:01:20.150> of<00:01:20.240> light<00:01:20.510> so<00:01:20.869> if<00:01:21.080> you<00:01:21.170> can

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
quite a bit of light so if you can

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.260 
quite a bit of light so if you can
provide<00:01:21.560> an<00:01:22.009> Eastern<00:01:22.490> or<00:01:22.670> a<00:01:22.700> southern

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
provide an Eastern or a southern

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.870 
provide an Eastern or a southern
exposure<00:01:23.710> window<00:01:24.710> it<00:01:24.950> would<00:01:25.100> be<00:01:25.250> perfect<00:01:25.790> just

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
exposure window it would be perfect just

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.120 
exposure window it would be perfect just
make<00:01:26.210> sure<00:01:26.450> you<00:01:26.659> shade<00:01:26.960> them<00:01:27.170> during<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:27.799> very

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
make sure you shade them during the very

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.120 
make sure you shade them during the very
hot<00:01:28.430> noon<00:01:28.970> Sun<00:01:29.390> as<00:01:29.900> these<00:01:30.229> orchids<00:01:30.619> are<00:01:30.770> not

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
hot noon Sun as these orchids are not

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.950 
hot noon Sun as these orchids are not
that<00:01:31.310> tolerant<00:01:31.880> to<00:01:32.119> direct<00:01:32.450> Sun<00:01:32.689> as<00:01:32.900> a

that tolerant to direct Sun as a
Dendrobium<00:01:33.890> nobody<00:01:34.250> let's<00:01:34.460> say<00:01:34.610> you<00:01:35.240> might

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
Dendrobium nobody let's say you might

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.920 
Dendrobium nobody let's say you might
have<00:01:35.780> some<00:01:36.079> sun<00:01:36.500> burns<00:01:36.770> on<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:37.520> leaves<00:01:37.759> but<00:01:38.659> if

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
have some sun burns on the leaves but if

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.499 
have some sun burns on the leaves but if
you<00:01:39.049> can<00:01:39.320> provide<00:01:39.829> very<00:01:40.430> bright<00:01:40.820> shade<00:01:41.210> it

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
you can provide very bright shade it

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.719 
you can provide very bright shade it
would<00:01:41.689> be<00:01:41.840> perfect<00:01:42.439> for<00:01:42.650> them<00:01:42.829> the<00:01:43.400> lack<00:01:43.549> of

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
would be perfect for them the lack of

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.819 
would be perfect for them the lack of
light<00:01:43.939> can<00:01:44.420> make<00:01:44.630> a<00:01:44.689> flower<00:01:44.869> spike<00:01:45.229> have<00:01:45.470> less

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
light can make a flower spike have less

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:48.100 
light can make a flower spike have less
buds<00:01:46.189> or<00:01:46.640> I<00:01:46.700> can<00:01:46.909> make<00:01:47.060> an<00:01:47.210> orchid<00:01:47.540> have<00:01:47.750> less

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
buds or I can make an orchid have less

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.310 
buds or I can make an orchid have less
spikes<00:01:48.500> or<00:01:48.799> no<00:01:49.220> spikes<00:01:49.700> at<00:01:49.970> all<00:01:50.299> so<00:01:50.810> I<00:01:50.840> believe

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
spikes or no spikes at all so I believe

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.800 
spikes or no spikes at all so I believe
light<00:01:51.590> is<00:01:51.860> one<00:01:52.610> of<00:01:52.820> the<00:01:52.970> most<00:01:53.180> important

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
light is one of the most important

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.300 
light is one of the most important
factors<00:01:54.290> in<00:01:54.460> reblooming<00:01:55.460> this<00:01:55.850> orchid<00:01:57.310> during

factors in reblooming this orchid during

factors in reblooming this orchid during
the<00:01:58.460> growing<00:01:58.729> season<00:01:59.110> then<00:02:00.110> drove<00:02:00.290> in

you<00:02:14.239> will<00:02:14.360> also<00:02:14.540> notice<00:02:14.959> that<00:02:15.319> your<00:02:15.470> orchid

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
you will also notice that your orchid

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.650 
you will also notice that your orchid

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
to water your orchid when the growing

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.310 
to water your orchid when the growing
season<00:02:25.250> stops<00:02:25.550> you<00:02:25.910> can<00:02:26.120> reduce<00:02:26.480> watering<00:02:27.110> and

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
season stops you can reduce watering and

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.590 
season stops you can reduce watering and
I<00:02:28.040> just<00:02:28.280> let<00:02:28.460> the<00:02:28.610> orchid<00:02:28.910> tell<00:02:29.150> you<00:02:29.330> when<00:02:29.480> it

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
I just let the orchid tell you when it

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.330 
I just let the orchid tell you when it
needs<00:02:29.870> water<00:02:30.140> but<00:02:30.560> don't<00:02:30.770> be<00:02:30.890> afraid<00:02:30.980> to

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
needs water but don't be afraid to

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.270 
needs water but don't be afraid to
really<00:02:31.670> soak<00:02:32.120> these<00:02:32.420> guys<00:02:32.750> and<00:02:33.140> then<00:02:33.920> drain

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
really soak these guys and then drain

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.130 
really soak these guys and then drain
them<00:02:34.460> really<00:02:34.760> well<00:02:34.940> and<00:02:35.180> place<00:02:35.450> them<00:02:35.690> in<00:02:35.870> their

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
them really well and place them in their

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.780 
them really well and place them in their
spots<00:02:37.900> during<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:39.170> growing<00:02:39.440> season<00:02:39.590> I<00:02:40.190> use

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
spots during the growing season I use

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.390 
spots during the growing season I use
fertilizer<00:02:41.510> regularly<00:02:42.380> half<00:02:43.010> of<00:02:43.280> the

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
fertilizer regularly half of the

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.120 
fertilizer regularly half of the
recommended<00:02:43.730> dosage<00:02:44.120> every<00:02:44.840> two<00:02:45.230> weeks<00:02:45.560> and<00:02:45.890> I

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
recommended dosage every two weeks and I

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.640 
recommended dosage every two weeks and I
use<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.700> higher<00:02:46.910> nitrogen<00:02:47.650> fertilizer

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
use the higher nitrogen fertilizer

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.410 
use the higher nitrogen fertilizer
because<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.190> new<00:02:49.340> growth<00:02:49.700> will<00:02:50.000> really

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
because the new growth will really

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.780 
because the new growth will really
benefit<00:02:50.900> from<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.320> nitrogen<00:02:51.770> and<00:02:52.280> it<00:02:52.670> will

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
benefit from the nitrogen and it will

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.990 
benefit from the nitrogen and it will
grow<00:02:53.030> faster<00:02:53.630> and<00:02:53.660> more<00:02:54.110> vigorous<00:02:54.980> than<00:02:55.550> if

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
grow faster and more vigorous than if

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.840 
grow faster and more vigorous than if
you<00:02:56.240> don't<00:02:56.720> use<00:02:56.900> any<00:02:57.140> fertilizer<00:02:57.650> at<00:02:57.950> all<00:02:58.280> so<00:02:58.820> a

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
you don't use any fertilizer at all so a

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.210 
you don't use any fertilizer at all so a
good<00:02:59.060> fertilizer<00:02:59.510> regime<00:03:00.050> can<00:03:00.530> make<00:03:00.860> you<00:03:01.010> have

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
good fertilizer regime can make you have

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.180 
good fertilizer regime can make you have
longer<00:03:02.030> sprays<00:03:02.510> of<00:03:02.690> flowers<00:03:03.110> and<00:03:03.410> more<00:03:03.860> flower

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
longer sprays of flowers and more flower

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
old cane as well so it's not a good idea

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.510 
old cane as well so it's not a good idea

to cut off the cane the markings you

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.580 
to cut off the cane the markings you
have<00:03:43.730> the<00:03:44.030> more<00:03:44.270> flower<00:03:44.840> spikes<00:03:45.260> you<00:03:45.440> might

have the more flower spikes you might

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.160 
have the more flower spikes you might
have<00:03:45.830> so<00:03:46.130> that's<00:03:46.459> a<00:03:46.610> really<00:03:47.090> great<00:03:47.239> bonus<00:03:47.930> and
