 "Phytates and Cancer Prevention" 

00:00:07.238 --> 00:00:11.039
 Cancer prevention recommendations place great emphasis on healthy eating, 

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:13.262
 because eating habits are the most important 

00:00:13.262 --> 00:00:15.418
 external risk factor for cancer. 

00:00:15.418 --> 00:00:18.140
 In recent years, many have naturally become 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.674
 occurring substances of plant origin are recognized, 

00:00:20.674 --> 00:00:23.422
 that they have anti-cancer effects. 

00:00:23.422 --> 00:00:25.085
 These substances are known as phytochemicals. 

00:00:25.085 --> 00:00:28.330
 Yes, beans, chickpeas, peas and lentils 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.699
 they are packed with all the nutrients our body needs, 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.164
 but the reason they can protect us from several kinds of degenerative 

00:00:35.164 --> 00:00:37.663
 diseases, it may be that they contain, in addition to nutrients, other plant active substances. 

00:00:37.663 --> 00:00:42.660
 Sometimes they are even so-called antinutritional substances, such as phytates. 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.501
 The phytate reputation has been since their discovery 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.099
 you can compare roller-coaster ride. 

00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:50.814
 They were alternately picked up and rejected. 

00:00:50.814 --> 00:00:53.063
 What everyone agrees is that 

00:00:53.063 --> 00:00:55.042
 that phytates, or phytic acid, 

00:00:55.042 --> 00:00:57.522
 They are one of the most fascinating bioactive substances present in food. 

00:00:57.522 --> 00:01:00.699
 They are widespread in plant foods. 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:06.235
 In the United States, colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death. 

00:01:06.235 --> 00:01:07.659
 In some parts of the world, they have the opposite 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.341
 The US has only a fractional incidence of this cancer. 

00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:14.618
 Most common is in Connecticut, USA 

00:01:14.618 --> 00:01:18.371
 and the rarest in Kampala, Uganda. 

00:01:18.371 --> 00:01:21.817
 Famous surgeon dr. Burkitt spent 24 years in Uganda and most of the Ugandans 

00:01:21.817 --> 00:01:24.660
 hospitals he contacted 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.419
 has never encountered any case of colon cancer. 

00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:32.500
 Given that the local population prevailed solid 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.740
 vegetable foods, it occurred to him that fiber could protect the inhabitants. 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.890
 However, studies like this have questioned such an explanation. 

00:01:40.893 --> 00:01:44.380
 The Danes seem to have more colon cancer than the Finns, 

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:47.860
 although they consume almost twice as much fiber. 

00:01:47.862 --> 00:01:50.460
 What else could explain the low incidence of cancer 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.820
 in predominantly plant diets? 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.140
 Fiber is not the only thing that is found only in compact plant foods 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.500
 and missing in processed and animal foods. 

00:01:59.507 --> 00:02:02.500
 Maybe it's phytates. 

00:02:02.501 --> 00:02:06.460
 Maybe food phytates rather than fiber alone 

00:02:06.461 --> 00:02:08.700
 they can be the most important variable 

00:02:08.708 --> 00:02:11.060
 decisive about the incidence of colon cancer. 

00:02:11.061 --> 00:02:13.700
 As we know, phytate strongly suppresses 

00:02:13.701 --> 00:02:17.540
 iron-mediated formation of hydroxyl radicals 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.020
 which is a particularly dangerous type of free radicals. 

00:02:20.029 --> 00:02:23.300
 So the standard American diet hurts us in two ways. 

00:02:23.305 --> 00:02:26.620
 It contains a lot of heme iron from flesh (meat) and at the same time few phytates due to income 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.930
 especially the refined plant foods. Otherwise, phytates would absorb free radicals from iron. 

00:02:30.932 --> 00:02:34.810
 This could explain what scientists found in an adventitious study. 

00:02:34.817 --> 00:02:36.790
 They found that the high risk of cancer is linked 

00:02:36.792 --> 00:02:39.310
 with higher red and white meat intake, 

00:02:39.314 --> 00:02:43.190
 which suggests that all types of meat contribute to colon cancer. 

00:02:43.192 --> 00:02:46.830
 People consuming red meat had about twice the risk 

00:02:46.834 --> 00:02:49.820
 and people consuming chicken and fish even had a triple risk. 

00:02:49.826 --> 00:02:53.430
 Those who eat meat can reduce their risk in two ways. 

00:02:53.433 --> 00:02:58.390
 They can either reduce meat intake or eat more legumes, 

00:02:58.392 --> 00:03:00.300
 which are an excellent source of phytates. 

00:03:00.306 --> 00:03:02.510
 So it's not just about how much meat we eat, 

00:03:02.511 --> 00:03:06.870
 but it is also the ratio of meat to vegetables. 

00:03:06.873 --> 00:03:09.150
 Between these two extremes, 

00:03:09.153 --> 00:03:11.400
 diet with a high proportion of plant foods and low meat content 

00:03:11.487 --> 00:03:13.280
 and a diet with a high proportion of meat and a low proportion of plant foods, 

00:03:13.285 --> 00:03:15.740
 the risk ratio seems to be 1: 8. 

00:03:15.748 --> 00:03:18.000
 This is a number high enough to 

00:03:18.005 --> 00:03:22.110
 to explain the large differences in colorectal cancer incidence in different countries. 

00:03:22.114 --> 00:03:24.320
 Those who picked the worst on both sides 

00:03:24.326 --> 00:03:25.750
 so they ate a lot of meat and little vegetables, 

00:03:25.754 --> 00:03:31.050
 risk of developing this cancer.
