00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.140
 we are going to perform the unboxing and analysis 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.990
 of the headphones of the brand beats 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.849
 is about the studio model and specifically the 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.460
 wireless model because as we will see 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.460
 below is a model that can be 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.529
 used with or without cable the first thing that we 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.920
 striking are the dimensions of 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.680
 the box that are quite large the 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.779
 good packaging because it has a design at 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.090
 which has us customary bits is 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.550
 say it has quality and has good design 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.690
 It has a modern design and we are going to 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.420
 proceed to open the box the box as 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.340
 You see, it looks like a shoe box is 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.260
 quite peculiar the way they have 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.050
 had bits to dance these these 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.719
 headphones 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.520
 if we remove the lid that protect the 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.990
 headphones the first thing we're going to 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.690
 find 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:59.780
 It's the case with a pretty design 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.310
 modern and inside will be the 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.090
 headphones like now after you 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.760
 we will show 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.670
 also in the interior we have another cover 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.990
 that if we raise it with enough force 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.900
 in the central area we will have a square 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.170
 that if we raise it, it's a small 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.510
 box with instructions and a cloth 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.520
 to clean the headphones since they 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.340
 we advance that if it is caught by the 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.800
 black model for example with brightness what 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.630
 the brand of fingers will stay 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.970
 absolutely impregnated in all 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.790
 headphones just touch them is 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.979
 amazing how many footprints that 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.290
 remain in the headphones after 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.660
 a few hours of use by part in the 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.390
 inferior what we find is a 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:48.570
 box and inside presumably 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.570
 all the accessories will be if we open 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.810
 the box the first thing we found 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.850
 will be the charger that goes to the wall and 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.119
 let's remember these headphones though 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.350
 They are wireless can be recharged 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.790
 by the cable that now after you 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.920
 we will show 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.980
 the second thing we have is the cable 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.800
 load as you see it is a cable with 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.490
 one of its endings is a usb 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.690
 conventional and in the other is a mini usb 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:19.110
 which is the one that will connect to the 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.720
 headphones the second cable that comes 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.990
 in the packaging is the one that carries the 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.380
 volume control to the other third button 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.450
 central that is to accept to reject the 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.090
 calls and will also work with the 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.730
 voice assistant siri if you have 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.700
 an iphone on the back of this 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.880
 command we have a microphone to be able 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.100
 perform all these functions the third 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.900
 cable that we are going to show is very 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.630
 similar to the one we just showed you 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.280
 The only thing that differentiates them is that they do not 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.020
 has the control or volume control 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.170
 therefore good if we want to use 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.660
 a simpler cable we can make use 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.090
 of this cable or one of the jacks go to 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.190
 headset and another takes our 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.250
 device where we have the music already 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.150
 be a computer a television or what 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.099
 be 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.860
 and the last of the accessories that is 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:14.209
 quite peculiar is a carabiner that does not 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:18.689
 we know for absolutely what is used 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:20.489
 let's take the cover as you see we are going to 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:23.459
 open the headphones that are inside 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.500
 of this case to show you its design 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.900
 The first thing that attracts attention is the 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.319
 way in which bit is designed its 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.579
 closure is not about a closure 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:36.299
 symmetric but that's good because it has this 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:39.959
 particular way that makes it is your 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:42.480
 folded occupy less space we take away 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.480
 the two stickers that come from the factory 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.489
 to the headphones to start 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.190
 analyze the construction of 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.829
 headphones the weight of the headphones 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.349
 it's right they do not weigh more than a few 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:58.139
 headphones of the competition and in the 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:00.209
 every day that we have been using them 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:03.420
 truth is that they do not do too much 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.670
 heavy it is true that the headband is 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.889
 quite large therefore good for 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.410
 we will have to have a good head 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:12.090
 so that these headphones do not remain 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.680
 excessively large 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.090
 As for the construction of the 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.850
 headphones we have to say that it is 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.070
 absolutely plastic and also bits 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.380
 does not hide it with any type of paint 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.870
 and nothing is noticed to the league in his 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:28.260
 plastic construction both in the 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.870
 diadem with like in one's ears in 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.270
 superior material of the headband that is 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.240
 what is what we will have in 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.790
 our head is rubber is not leather 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.729
 but good has a correct touch the 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:45.270
 true that if you miss some 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:48.210
 headphones of about 380 euros that the 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:51.000
 Upper rubber is leather though 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.880
 If leather is the material that protects 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.520
 the ears have a touch moreover quite 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:59.130
 soft and we do not understand as a part of 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.380
 the fact that a leather and another part with 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.889
 Also, the inside of the 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.570
 headphones is pretty protected what 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:08.910
 which is quite good in the part 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:12.090
 bottom of the headphones we have for 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.830
 one side takes it if we want to connect 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.030
 by one of the cables that comes 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.010
 incorporated 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:20.040
 and on the other side what we will be 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:22.920
 the mini usb socket through which 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:25.050
 we can charge the headphones to a 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:28.470
 power outlet or a computer 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:31.080
 via usb in the left ear there is 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:34.410
 a button through which we can 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.600
 pause the music with a click we can 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.670
 make two clicks 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.280
 to move on to the next song three 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:43.560
 clicks to go back to the song 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.720
 previous and if we press up or 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.660
 down we can raise or lower the 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.740
 volume which is very well thought out already 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.440
 that it's about headphones 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:55.560
 wireless and not always and we will not 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:58.770
 your phone or music player to 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:01.170
 hand and we do not have the need to 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:04.230
 take the cable with us so 

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:06.060
 So much is a great success in addition 

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:09.360
 It has an off and on button 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:11.160
 that if we keep it pressed what we 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:15.360
 will indicate the battery status 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:17.640
 by five white LEDs will be 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:22.560
 the 5 LEDs and the battery turned on 

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:24.630
 the stop and 1 if the battery is at 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:27.060
 point of finishing also while 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:29.610
 are loading at all times we will go 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:31.710
 indicating the state of the battery in 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:36.200
 function of the number of LEDs that 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:36.200
 they illuminate which is greatly appreciated
