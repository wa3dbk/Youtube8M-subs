00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
that in the bacon is like ash it's

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.930 
that in the bacon is like ash it's
pretty<00:03:15.410> thick<00:03:15.560> and<00:03:15.739> that's<00:03:16.430> what<00:03:16.579> happens

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
pretty thick and that's what happens

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.780 
pretty thick and that's what happens
overnight<00:03:17.180> it<00:03:17.540> creates<00:03:18.410> a<00:03:18.500> simple<00:03:18.890> batter<00:03:19.310> and

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
overnight it creates a simple batter and

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.020 
overnight it creates a simple batter and
it<00:03:20.239> makes<00:03:20.420> it<00:03:20.599> so<00:03:21.280> okay<00:03:22.280> so<00:03:22.459> I'm<00:03:22.730> going<00:03:22.849> to<00:03:22.879> use

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
it makes it so okay so I'm going to use

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.020 
it makes it so okay so I'm going to use
that<00:03:23.180> cover<00:03:24.079> this<00:03:24.260> one<00:03:24.440> and<00:03:24.879> we're<00:03:25.879> going<00:03:26.000> to

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
that cover this one and we're going to

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.619 
that cover this one and we're going to
keep<00:03:26.180> going

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:28.629 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:31.390 

so<00:03:29.629> traditionally<00:03:30.260> they're<00:03:30.709> usually<00:03:30.920> baked

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
so traditionally they're usually baked

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.229 
so traditionally they're usually baked
with<00:03:31.940> these<00:03:32.269> um<00:03:32.720> copper<00:03:33.620> mold<00:03:33.769> I<00:03:34.250> didn't<00:03:35.090> have

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
with these um copper mold I didn't have

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.150 
with these um copper mold I didn't have
the<00:03:35.510> holes<00:03:35.930> they're<00:03:36.290> really<00:03:36.500> expensive<00:03:36.829> the

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
the holes they're really expensive the

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.550 
the holes they're really expensive the
like<00:03:37.280> twenty-five<00:03:37.730> dollars<00:03:38.090> so<00:03:38.900> it's<00:03:39.290> the<00:03:39.410> way

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
like twenty-five dollars so it's the way

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.710 
like twenty-five dollars so it's the way
we're<00:03:39.769> define<00:03:40.069> these<00:03:40.760> are<00:03:40.970> like<00:03:41.120> about<00:03:41.269> five

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
we're define these are like about five

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.559 
we're define these are like about five
so<00:03:42.260> I<00:03:42.290> may<00:03:42.470> have<00:03:42.500> a<00:03:42.680> feeling<00:03:43.160> I<00:03:43.390> studies<00:03:44.390> online

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
so I may have a feeling I studies online

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:46.870 
so I may have a feeling I studies online
and<00:03:45.109> I<00:03:45.290> figured<00:03:45.769> might<00:03:46.099> as<00:03:46.129> well<00:03:46.340> buy<00:03:46.819> these

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
and I figured might as well buy these

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.659 
and I figured might as well buy these
and<00:03:47.359> see<00:03:47.930> how<00:03:48.230> they<00:03:48.349> work

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:49.669 
and see how they work

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:51.909 
and see how they work
I've<00:03:50.540> never<00:03:50.780> been<00:03:50.959> offended<00:03:51.290> because<00:03:51.500> it<00:03:51.769> was

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:51.919 
I've never been offended because it was

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:55.150 
I've never been offended because it was
one<00:03:52.280> see<00:03:52.579> and<00:03:52.940> they'll<00:03:53.660> hold<00:03:53.870> a<00:03:54.019> shape<00:03:54.319> but<00:03:54.829> I

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
one see and they'll hold a shape but I

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.180 
one see and they'll hold a shape but I
baked<00:03:55.880> a<00:03:56.030> few<00:03:56.239> I<00:03:56.680> baking<00:03:57.680> all<00:03:57.799> day<00:03:57.829> yesterday

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
baked a few I baking all day yesterday

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.849 
baked a few I baking all day yesterday
and<00:03:59.060> try<00:03:59.239> to<00:03:59.299> figure<00:03:59.540> out<00:03:59.720> like<00:04:00.169> a<00:04:00.200> good<00:04:00.470> recipe

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859 
and try to figure out like a good recipe

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:05.229 
and try to figure out like a good recipe
now<00:04:01.400> these<00:04:01.579> could<00:04:02.000> work<00:04:03.130> so<00:04:04.130> what<00:04:04.760> I<00:04:04.790> did<00:04:05.120> I'm

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
now these could work so what I did I'm

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:06.370 
now these could work so what I did I'm
going<00:04:05.359> to<00:04:05.419> show<00:04:05.510> you<00:04:05.540> a<00:04:05.630> little<00:04:05.810> trick<00:04:06.109> that<00:04:06.230> I

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
did to make these like a really hard

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.220 
did to make these like a really hard
shell<00:04:09.950> on<00:04:10.099> the<00:04:10.220> outside<00:04:10.250> okay

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
shell on the outside okay

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.659 
shell on the outside okay

free shipping so I thought that was a
good<00:04:18.919> count<00:04:19.160> and<00:04:19.459> it's<00:04:19.820> going<00:04:20.000> to<00:04:20.060> be<00:04:20.180> right

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.510 
want every time but if you come out one
thing<00:06:01.840> that<00:06:01.990> I<00:06:02.050> like<00:06:02.200> about<00:06:02.230> these<00:06:02.710> I<00:06:03.100> should

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 
thing that I like about these I should

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.360 
thing that I like about these I should
come<00:06:03.850> out<00:06:03.970> right<00:06:04.150> away<00:06:04.390> but<00:06:05.260> the<00:06:05.800> problem<00:06:06.220> is

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 
come out right away but the problem is

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.140 
come out right away but the problem is
that<00:06:06.790> they're<00:06:07.480> not<00:06:07.630> as<00:06:07.840> crunchy<00:06:08.169> as

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
that they're not as crunchy as

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.830 
that they're not as crunchy as
ones<00:06:09.360> from<00:06:09.750> your<00:06:10.760> this<00:06:11.760> is<00:06:11.910> messing<00:06:12.300> co<00:06:12.540> the

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
ones from your this is messing co the

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.070 
ones from your this is messing co the
aluminium<00:06:13.350> because<00:06:14.010> it<00:06:14.310> is<00:06:15.180> a<00:06:15.330> really<00:06:15.510> good

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 
aluminium because it is a really good

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.960 
aluminium because it is a really good
conductor<00:06:16.760> that's<00:06:17.760> why<00:06:17.940> people<00:06:18.090> use<00:06:18.360> er<00:06:18.690> a

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:19.970 
conductor that's why people use er a

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:24.320 
conductor that's why people use er a
copper<00:06:20.970> but<00:06:21.660> these<00:06:21.840> pop<00:06:22.170> up<00:06:22.320> right<00:06:22.500> away<00:06:23.330> the

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:24.330 
copper but these pop up right away the

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.360 
copper but these pop up right away the
problem<00:06:24.870> is<00:06:25.260> that<00:06:25.470> they<00:06:25.830> don't<00:06:25.920> have<00:06:26.190> that

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
problem is that they don't have that

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:33.340 
problem is that they don't have that
crust<00:06:26.990> that<00:06:27.990> we<00:06:28.400> achieve<00:06:29.400> with<00:06:30.330> elements<00:06:32.000> and

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:33.350 
crust that we achieve with elements and

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.380 
crust that we achieve with elements and
so<00:06:34.350> what<00:06:34.680> we're<00:06:34.800> going<00:06:34.890> to<00:06:34.950> do<00:06:35.160> is<00:06:35.700> we're<00:06:36.300> gonna

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:36.390 
so what we're going to do is we're gonna

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:39.230 
so what we're going to do is we're gonna
pop<00:06:36.690> these<00:06:36.930> in<00:06:37.200> the<00:06:37.230> oven<00:06:37.700> for<00:06:38.700> an<00:06:38.790> additional

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240 
pop these in the oven for an additional

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.470 
pop these in the oven for an additional
five<00:06:39.780> minutes<00:06:40.040> don't<00:06:41.040> go<00:06:41.250> overboard<00:06:41.480> just

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:42.480 
five minutes don't go overboard just

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.490 
five minutes don't go overboard just
these<00:06:42.630> ripples<00:06:43.550> okay<00:06:44.550> five<00:06:45.210> minutes<00:06:45.360> time<00:06:46.230> it

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:46.500 
these ripples okay five minutes time it

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.710 
these ripples okay five minutes time it
to<00:06:46.770> last<00:06:47.040> night<00:06:47.310> and<00:06:47.460> something<00:06:47.700> to<00:06:47.910> connect

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.010 

and<00:06:52.190> they're<00:06:53.190> gonna<00:06:53.310> be<00:06:53.520> really<00:06:53.760> good<00:06:54.270> okay

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.020 
and they're gonna be really good okay

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.240 
and they're gonna be really good okay
okay

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:56.250 
okay

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.090 
okay
so<00:06:56.490> these<00:06:57.060> took<00:06:57.300> about<00:06:57.630> seven<00:06:58.350> minutes<00:06:58.530> in<00:06:59.010> the

00:06:59.090 --> 00:06:59.100 
so these took about seven minutes in the

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.610 
so these took about seven minutes in the
oven<00:06:59.130> and<00:06:59.700> that's<00:07:00.090> how<00:07:00.570> we<00:07:00.630> are<00:07:00.870> able<00:07:00.990> to<00:07:01.230> keep

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:01.620 
oven and that's how we are able to keep

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.160 
oven and that's how we are able to keep
our<00:07:01.770> crust<00:07:02.190> from<00:07:02.370> our<00:07:02.580> silicone<00:07:03.030> molds<00:07:03.510> these

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:04.170 
our crust from our silicone molds these

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:07.040 
our crust from our silicone molds these
I<00:07:04.410> brought<00:07:04.620> a<00:07:04.650> restaurant<00:07:05.340> on<00:07:05.660> supplier<00:07:06.660> store

put it in right underneath the
description<00:07:15.510> box<00:07:15.630> so<00:07:16.260> that's<00:07:16.920> how<00:07:17.130> you

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:17.190 
description box so that's how you

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.930 
description box so that's how you
achieve<00:07:17.400> your<00:07:17.730> good<00:07:18.000> crispy<00:07:18.660> outside<00:07:18.900> and

achieve your good crispy outside and
most<00:07:20.940> restaurants<00:07:21.390> should<00:07:21.630> be<00:07:21.750> doing<00:07:22.020> this

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:22.140 
most restaurants should be doing this
