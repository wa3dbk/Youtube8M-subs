00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:22.560
 hi all ng 3 in touch today 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.220
 love another battle on the map 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.510
 pearl river 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:31.150
 and bbr as always favored of ages 40 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.940
 percent to win gave us and so we 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.010
 choose the left direction and in thoughts 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.580
 I think well, or now we will push 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.890
 either keep the direction because 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.799
 as you can see the team we got not 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.470
 the strongest but you say 603 

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:49.839
 why not list 3 here and possible 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.780
 tactic just go from a face like this 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:54.250
 did my allies but how is it all 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.339
 going to happen now you look 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.210
 yourself and so enemy is-7 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:03.309
 an exchange of courtesies occurred caught both 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.650
 non-penetration so on we do not climb and here 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.080
 See the dumbest mistake that 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.290
 could make our allies all go 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.119
 left and right here I mean 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.520
 Naturally this direction no one 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.259
 went to the cafes it could go on 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.229
 the right to be there and all the jeep suga 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:22.960
 just did not go and now in fact we 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.880
 We are surrounded because they 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.549
 now will be dug by both sides as well 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.789
 it would be all right on the left is e100 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:33.670
 E75 on the right is their chip and the center 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:35.880
 I hold well no floor too easy 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.759
 it can also be won therefore 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.789
 do not do that so I shoot 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.490
 mova neighbors you say that and an idiot 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:47.159
 I shoot in Moscow but guys on on 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.820
 Goldie makes her way not as often as 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.939
 wanted but punches you and shoot and 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.130
 punching 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.759
 of all, let them not be too much 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.700
 hope that there are few words in front of him 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:02.130
 so if we die then at 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.319
 at least arrange them such a whipping which 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:09.539
 remember for a long time now I wanted to now 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:12.330
 pick up from yag pz e100 but unfortunately not 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.970
 it turned out he had only 70 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.849
 xn I even venture to its hepe here and here 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.680
 See IS-7 rides to tune 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.110
 our ally in the ass 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.260
 but then I take this opportunity naturally 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.260
 I shoot him like a jagger behaves 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.260
 extremely aggressive naturally gets 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.170
 here now look from the guys in fact again 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.930
 we keep directions I'm on the mouse out 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.350
 on the left there somewhere out of 3 a cripple is worth her 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:44.450
 You see, he even kills yag pz e100 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:47.760
 floor generally damn unheard of unprecedented 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:52.769
 boy just handsome he drags so here 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:55.290
 I go to the tiger boys apparently pressured 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.989
 Whether skill or stupidity I do not know what 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.470
 so well here from 3 look behaves 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.569
 just so active and so travels and 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.579
 the scheme is not here I like crazy you they 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.650
 generally do not rise in the middle as if 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:11.280
 i'm not here so i shoot here on 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:14.489
 punching it and leaving more enemy 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.709
 e100 here t-44 makes a wonderful 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.810
 just a tactical move which is not 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.750
 everyone understands but still he seems to be 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.329
 leaves so shoot and you all well 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.790
 naturally stream right into the diamond i even 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.590
 I think at all desire you his dick when 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.040
 do you share when you want to get here 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:35.880
 so well here's the t-44 just got opposite 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.220
 e100 and is a 7 so and everyone to think that i 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.040
 its not your goal but it was not there 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.480
 send him to the hangar guys and everyone would 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.849
 nothing like already 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.510
 he is fine seven seven 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:49.530
 will be ours 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:52.370
 n begin to merge like a goner here we are 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.080
 I do not know, so here we are chewing e100 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.330
 Naturally we punch everything perfectly with us 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:01.290
 actually taking shape but here to 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:03.810
 Sorry, our aleshi tactical move 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:07.080
 make everything merge and everything look we 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:10.739
 already need magali more than 5 thousand damage and 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.900
 it's on the mouse and guys who me 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:15.299
 looks you have long known that it is not 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.699
 just going to be qualifying in essence 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:20.430
 me every second third fight just like that 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:22.680
 and it happens that I'm on the mouse less than 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.990
 several thousand damage just dim 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.360
 leaving the fight so watch me included 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.520
 enemy 704 here I understand that to us 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.979
 need to pick up as soon as possible 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.410
 I aim the lower armor sheet though on goldie 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:36.600
 it is not necessary but still possible 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.570
 rebound therefore do not risk because 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:42.270
 we can no longer be wrong so we see and 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:45.090
 Batchatka leaves I do not know apparently brooches and 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:49.260
 I won't get him naturally I take him away 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.520
 so here still appears Jagdpanther I 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.060
 I donâ€™t know what to do 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:59.250
 I start to play with body 704 before the mouse 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:01.710
 ass there chat and today so 704 too 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.830
 pick up in the hangar and now the guys from me 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:07.830
 nothing remains as easy to go 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:10.380
 need to kill e100 to at least with 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.780
 one direction to shoot and 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:17.220
 so I look while I'm like a panther there 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:19.470
 something is hiding something I decide well then to me 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.360
 lucky of course it's all of a sudden and not 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:24.300
 always almost never work 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.389
 didn't rip this one i aim e100 but i 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:30.210
 to panther unfortunately takes me here 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:32.970
 such a battle 6000 we damage the fig 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:35.940
 chili and it means absolutely nothing 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:39.360
 medal we were given a second degree and 1300 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:42.569
 experience for the defeat, and as you can see here 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.849
 we are in the top of the distant top here ask how 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:48.900
 played our allies nathan cavalli 4 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:54.199
 400 damage so that's such a fight and not 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:54.199
 play the mouse is a bad adios tank
