00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
to scale this week we're going to be

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.310 
to scale this week we're going to be
looking<00:00:26.400> at<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.759> gameplay<00:00:27.449> situation<00:00:28.079> I'm

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
looking at a gameplay situation I'm

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.749 
looking at a gameplay situation I'm
going<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.560> take<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.800> through<00:00:29.039> what<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.429> believe

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:29.759 
going to take you through what I believe

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:32.240 
going to take you through what I believe
are<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.060> three<00:00:30.449> defensive<00:00:31.169> principles<00:00:31.859> and

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
are the three defensive principles and

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.050 
are the three defensive principles and
then<00:00:32.340> we're<00:00:32.430> going<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.579> look<00:00:32.700> at<00:00:32.820> what<00:00:33.030> a

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.060 
then we're going to look at what a

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.180 
then we're going to look at what a
defender<00:00:33.510> wants<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.870> consider<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.560> in<00:00:35.070> this

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
defender wants to consider that in this

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.040 
defender wants to consider that in this
situation<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:36.000> actually<00:00:36.390> attacker<00:00:36.660> on<00:00:36.780> the

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
situation is actually attacker on the

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.380 
situation is actually attacker on the
defender<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.310> first<00:00:38.550> principle<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.300> it's

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
defender the first principle and it's

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.080 
defender the first principle and it's
not<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.600> principle<00:00:40.200> is<00:00:40.740> that<00:00:41.040> I'm<00:00:41.250> not<00:00:41.610> marking

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
not a principle is that I'm not marking

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.140 
not a principle is that I'm not marking
Zach<00:00:42.330> the<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.320> second<00:00:43.710> principle<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:44.790> that

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.150 
Zach the the second principle is that

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.360 
Zach the the second principle is that
now<00:00:45.660> I'm<00:00:45.810> engaged<00:00:46.140> with<00:00:46.350> second<00:00:46.710> marking<00:00:47.040> the

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
now I'm engaged with second marking the

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.480 
now I'm engaged with second marking the
third<00:00:47.610> one<00:00:47.880> is<00:00:48.540> I'm<00:00:48.900> animated<00:00:49.620> I'm<00:00:49.860> engaged

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:50.490 
third one is I'm animated I'm engaged

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.430 
third one is I'm animated I'm engaged
and<00:00:50.850> I'm<00:00:51.150> not<00:00:51.300> only<00:00:51.540> marking<00:00:51.990> exact<00:00:52.200> but<00:00:52.350> I'm

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
and I'm not only marking exact but I'm

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.900 
and I'm not only marking exact but I'm
denying<00:00:52.770> exact<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.220> ball<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:53.790> this

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
denying exact the ball so in this

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.660

00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:31.319 
closer I'm more engaged and I can put a

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:32.749 
closer I'm more engaged and I can put a
bit<00:01:31.469> of<00:01:31.499> pressure<00:01:31.590> on<00:01:31.950> Zach<00:01:32.189> so<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.579> point

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
bit of pressure on Zach so the point

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:33.800 
bit of pressure on Zach so the point
we're<00:01:32.850> trying<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.030> make<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.270> morning<00:01:33.539> is

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
we're trying to make this morning is

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.200 
we're trying to make this morning is
this<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.679> the<00:01:34.920> defensive<00:01:35.460> principle<00:01:35.939> I'd<00:01:36.030> like

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
this is the defensive principle I'd like

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.840 
this is the defensive principle I'd like
to<00:01:36.389> see<00:01:36.590> heavily<00:01:37.590> engaged<00:01:37.920> trying<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.639> deny

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
to see heavily engaged trying to deny

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.209 
to see heavily engaged trying to deny
the<00:01:39.479> strike<00:01:39.749> of<00:01:39.899> the<00:01:39.960> ball

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:44.219 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:46.529 

so<00:01:45.219> we're<00:01:45.340> going<00:01:45.430> to<00:01:45.520> take<00:01:45.670> this<00:01:45.789> into<00:01:46.030> a<00:01:46.090> game
