down too quick we just don't think
that's<00:01:23.539> the<00:01:23.719> way<00:01:23.840> to<00:01:23.990> do<00:01:24.350> it<00:01:24.469> anymore<00:01:24.680> the<00:01:24.920> way

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
that's the way to do it anymore the way

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.260 
that's the way to do it anymore the way
to<00:01:26.030> get<00:01:26.479> speed<00:01:26.960> is<00:01:27.289> to<00:01:27.469> find<00:01:27.829> out<00:01:28.070> what<00:01:28.880> trips

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
to get speed is to find out what trips

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.599 
to get speed is to find out what trips
your<00:01:29.539> dog's<00:01:29.840> trigger<00:01:30.320> to<00:01:30.890> get<00:01:31.130> it<00:01:31.310> to<00:01:31.490> the

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:31.609 
your dog's trigger to get it to the

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:33.490 
your dog's trigger to get it to the

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
highest level of motivation that you can

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.010 
highest level of motivation that you can
get<00:01:33.710> and<00:01:34.009> then<00:01:34.549> work<00:01:34.820> on<00:01:35.000> timing<00:01:35.570> with<00:01:35.990> your

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
dog and by that I mean we'll use the

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.080 
dog and by that I mean we'll use the
example<00:01:40.670> of<00:01:40.759> a<00:01:40.880> tug<00:01:41.090> but<00:01:41.960> it<00:01:42.079> could<00:01:42.320> be<00:01:43.090> high

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
example of a tug but it could be high
