00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.690
 Chamorro 

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:12.579
 Chamorro 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.450
 We hope to see some tricks that will improve 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.310
 the user experience in windows 7 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.390
 and taking advantage of the new features offered by windows 7 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.089
 let's go see some examples to go 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:28.999
 that will allow us to make the most of this operating system 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.190
 Well, one of the things that allows us 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.570
 destroyed 7 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.570
 is to set the power vote 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.329
 good for it 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:42.710
 what are we going to be 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.480
 at least start 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.190
 and as you can see in the turn off button 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.720
 let's make a right click 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.260
 and the defendants on property 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.280
 in which we are in this advantage 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.520
 as you see 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.190
 here we are allowed to change modify the action of the future 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.969
 p the system 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.500
 default 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.490
 to execute the action to turn off the computer 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.890
 we can 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.500
 set it up so that this one 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.860
 by pressing on the button 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.910
 the mityc and pop 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.680
 you can change user 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.340
 simply after closing the session 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.719
 block the computer restart 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:24.680
 Bernard 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.100
 or just suspend tickets 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.100
 in the versus mode 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.020
 well other things allows us windows 7 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.380
 they are clear 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.570
 a folder 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.970
 if we usually do 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.970
 this is so that we can access 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.740
 hit folders 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.110
 Count it easier 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.010
 and in less time than if we had 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.090
 to start browsing please 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.730
 give to said jail 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.220
 good for it 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.410
 let's welcome 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.890
 and for example if I want 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:05.790
 so clear 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.490
 a slap 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:08.609
 of work 

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:11.229
 in the start menu simply 

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:12.389
 many men 

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:13.579
 said date 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:14.559
 dragged 

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:17.569
 finally the beginning and as you will see 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.889
 we see a point a poster with are clear 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:23.889
 just loose 

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:27.869
 we already have this folder so clear 

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:31.279
 nathan deal 

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:34.219
 to go sailing 

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:37.449
 the former player assembly 

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:40.699
 another advantage that windows 7 allows us 

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:43.199
 this month the hand always the panel 

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:44.389
 of control 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:45.519
 of the system 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:50.029
 until now to access it we will have to open the start menu locate the 

00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:53.619
 control panel will already look said that they like benzene 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:57.099
 always present here 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:58.500
 what are they called jade 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.859
 of system the icon that allows us 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:05.319
 namely to switch between one sale or another to the control panel 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:07.320
 buenos aires efe 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.560
 a board had a little trick 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.159
 that allows us to announce the always 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:15.359
 so that we do not have to make the film in a missile 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:19.459
 good for them we are not that April gesture the control panel and once we 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.119
 we have it ready 

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:23.549
 For its part, we double-click 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.349
 operates a puppet done beg I do not 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:29.429
 and like 6 hank the actress and proclaims at sunset 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:32.369
 when clicking on 

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:35.089
 that option 

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:36.309
 if we close 

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:38.119
 said window of using contraband 

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:40.439
 we see 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:42.559
 the icon has been left 

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:44.349
 of the panel 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:45.529
 simply 

00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:48.469
 asserted normally 

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:50.209
 we just have to 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.209
 southeast pulsar 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:56.559
 another little trick 

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:58.629
 that we can apply in windows 7 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:03.969
 the deceased figure is given the size of the elements that we are going to famous 

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:08.339
 skewer or important parties when we are going to start asking 

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:09.250
 the team 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.509
 still predecessor 

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:11.530
 or yet 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:12.999
 a TV 

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:15.919
 d large and in high definition 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:17.479
 at the parade 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:18.499
 to the 

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:19.970
 when projecting the image 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.039
 let's see what the elements 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:23.110
 is going to stay 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.390
 too small 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.650
 Well, to modify this, we're just going to do 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.379
 standing upright on the desk we're going to 

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:34.110
 click on your head 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.800
 we go to diet 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.740
 screen once fixed on screen simply with time to facilitate reading 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.740
 for now on screen 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.129
 we are not going to change the size 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:48.430
 of the elements here in more 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.400
 sea 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.080
 to the image that we have 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.779
 this text or on the screen that 

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:55.050
 of the crime 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.050
 of the television 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.150
 or it's interesting too is 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.529
 even 

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:04.380
 there 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.380
 that refers to the context menus 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:09.749
 shakira and piquÃ© 

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:12.849
 when for example we are going to work with a file 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:18.319
 and we want to send it to a different destination to whose different folder 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:21.379
 simply click on the hotel 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:24.379
 right foot fernando 

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:26.889
 and when we are going to start ap 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:30.840
 let's see what certain limited destinations appear to us because 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:33.990
 because they do not appear 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.729
 another folder 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:39.770
 as the systems folder library images documents etc 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.770
 well the trucho consists of 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.249
 the key of may the blades 

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:49.520
 and then make right foot 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.430
 if now we go again to send ap 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.199
 we see how the neighbors teach 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:57.180
 previously 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.389
 they are added 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:02.889
 new faces and masks new destination where you can send the file is the 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:06.110
 success 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.159
 another group that we can 

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:13.030
 does any check because it allows us to windows 7 is to configure 

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:15.320
 the gibbs elements 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.360
 let's see why they are going to show 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.099
 in the tray the set 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:21.699
 good for it 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:24.189
 let's go to that arrow 

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:26.159
 and we will give you attention 

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:27.439
 in personnel and saved 

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:29.740
 beney who do not appear 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.699
 the application of this maximum penalty of a team 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:35.319
 percent include here we could 

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:37.889
 do that as explained not 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:39.610
 hop to hide 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:44.159
 or simply show the the notifications that the program 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:45.759
 lanzini 

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:47.419
 To the system 

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:50.419
 as we are saying let's see 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:51.810
 well bar 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.110
 or turn off some of the elements like the second clock 

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:58.110
 the icon p 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.779
 of speakers as of sound 

00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:01.730
 apf font 

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:04.339
 for that we have simply said 

00:07:04.339 --> 00:07:07.680
 let's see it again so things are clear only the system 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.960
 and here as you see and fiscal magic in the blog 

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.159
 when pressing on deactivated 

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:14.800
 in fact many parents 

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.800
 also famous city in the meantime audio 

00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:20.939
 the icon of herrera 

00:07:20.939 --> 00:07:23.869
 the center tour of the year 

00:07:23.869 --> 00:07:25.999
 and how they fall we will win 

00:07:25.999 --> 00:07:29.229
 cheapening space simply 

00:07:29.229 --> 00:07:31.599
 customize it scope 

00:07:31.599 --> 00:07:34.599
 must leave the city all 

00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:38.439
 etra practically 

00:07:38.439 --> 00:07:39.630
 a series 

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:41.849
 of these nonsense 

00:07:41.849 --> 00:07:43.270
 to configure 

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:47.740
 the user experience no teacher later on we will give you 

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.830
 another series b 

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:51.629
 of tricks 

00:07:51.629 --> 00:07:53.820
 and system to customize 

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:55.310
 the new operating system 

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:55.970
 from microsoft
