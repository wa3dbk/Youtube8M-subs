00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
this video is going to be going to be

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.560 
this video is going to be going to be
explaining<00:00:02.429> how<00:00:02.520> to<00:00:02.550> set<00:00:02.820> up<00:00:02.850> a<00:00:03.000> simple<00:00:03.210> plan

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
explaining how to set up a simple plan

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.300 
explaining how to set up a simple plan
because<00:00:03.929> I<00:00:04.020> don't<00:00:04.170> feel<00:00:04.230> like<00:00:04.470> writing<00:00:04.799> a<00:00:05.069> more

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
because I don't feel like writing a more

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.810 
because I don't feel like writing a more
documentation<00:00:07.189> so<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.309> first<00:00:08.519> thing<00:00:08.610> you

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
documentation so the first thing you

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.009 
documentation so the first thing you
need<00:00:08.940> to<00:00:09.000> do

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
need to do

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.480 
need to do
is<00:00:10.879> yet<00:00:11.879> open<00:00:12.360> up<00:00:12.449> the<00:00:12.570> script<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.289> that<00:00:13.500> good

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
is yet open up the script and that good

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.480 
is yet open up the script and that good
change<00:00:15.490> the<00:00:15.670> value<00:00:16.059> this<00:00:16.330> constant<00:00:17.490> to

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
change the value this constant to

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.140 
change the value this constant to
evaluate<00:00:19.300> to<00:00:19.510> the<00:00:20.080> manager

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
evaluate to the manager

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.109 
evaluate to the manager
all<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.449> your<00:00:21.619> plant<00:00:22.619> events<00:00:23.100> from<00:00:23.250> so<00:00:23.970> for

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
all of your plant events from so for

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.510 
all of your plant events from so for
this<00:00:24.210> example<00:00:24.510> interesting<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.529> map<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:28.160> ok<00:00:29.160> so

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:29.520 
this example interesting to map to ok so

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.429 
this example interesting to map to ok so
after<00:00:29.669> you've<00:00:29.939> done<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.869> need<00:00:31.020> to<00:00:31.169> go<00:00:31.380> to

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
after you've done that you need to go to

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.970 
after you've done that you need to go to
your<00:00:31.860> database<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.850> need<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.150> make<00:00:33.420> a

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
your database and you need to make a

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.420 
your database and you need to make a
need<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.010> make<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.340> MC<00:00:36.059> so<00:00:36.750> have<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:37.769> need<00:00:38.309> to

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
need to make a MC so have you need to

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.310 
need to make a MC so have you need to
make<00:00:38.550> an<00:00:38.699> item<00:00:39.000> never<00:00:39.210> bring<00:00:39.510> them<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.809> see<00:00:40.019> to

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
make an item never bring them to see to

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.460 
make an item never bring them to see to
this<00:00:40.470> this<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:40.830> over<00:00:41.280> Berlin<00:00:41.610> tomato<00:00:41.970> city<00:00:42.470> so

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.470 
this this I over Berlin tomato city so

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.079 
this this I over Berlin tomato city so
we<00:00:43.589> named<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:43.890> tomato<00:00:44.190> seed<00:00:44.550> we<00:00:44.730> gave<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:44.940> a

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:45.089 
we named it tomato seed we gave it a

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:48.700 
we named it tomato seed we gave it a
night<00:00:45.269> I<00:00:45.570> con-com<00:00:46.260> looks<00:00:46.530> like<00:00:46.680> tomato<00:00:47.040> seeds

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
night I con-com looks like tomato seeds

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.650 
night I con-com looks like tomato seeds
said<00:00:49.710> it's<00:00:49.860> tight<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.370> normal<00:00:50.820> made<00:00:51.420> sure<00:00:51.570> that

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
said it's tight to normal made sure that

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.569 
said it's tight to normal made sure that
we<00:00:51.720> don't

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
we don't

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.790 
we don't
we<00:00:53.699> made<00:00:54.089> sure<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.449> didn't<00:00:54.870> have<00:00:54.929> that<00:00:55.679> it

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
we made sure that I didn't have that it

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.660 
we made sure that I didn't have that it
didn't<00:00:56.039> affect<00:00:57.649> the<00:00:58.649> party<00:00:59.039> our<00:00:59.129> enemies

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
didn't affect the party our enemies

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.649 
didn't affect the party our enemies
after<00:01:00.420> we<00:01:00.839> did<00:01:00.989> all<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.350> we<00:01:01.739> gave<00:01:01.979> it<00:01:02.010> to

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:02.659 
after we did all that we gave it to

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:05.299 
after we did all that we gave it to
Syria<00:01:03.659> we<00:01:03.839> gave<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.259> a<00:01:04.290> mill<00:01:04.619> tailings<00:01:04.830> the

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
Syria we gave it to a mill tailings the

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.730 
Syria we gave it to a mill tailings the
purse<00:01:05.519> no<00:01:05.700> tag<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.240> specifies<00:01:06.960> how<00:01:06.990> fast<00:01:07.530> it

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
purse no tag is specifies how fast it

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.859 
purse no tag is specifies how fast it
grows<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.280> frames<00:01:10.189> so<00:01:11.189> this<00:01:11.399> seed<00:01:11.729> throws<00:01:12.210> one

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
grows in frames so this seed throws one

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.320 
grows in frames so this seed throws one
stage<00:01:13.259> every<00:01:13.799> 60<00:01:14.220> frames<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.880> would<00:01:15.090> see

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
stage every 60 frames that would see

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.800 
stage every 60 frames that would see
rate<00:01:15.630> 60<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.380> see<00:01:17.039> stages<00:01:17.549> 7<00:01:17.970> means<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.450> the

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
rate 60 and see stages 7 means that the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.770 
rate 60 and see stages 7 means that the
seed<00:01:19.080> has<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.649> total<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.369> seven<00:01:20.670> state<00:01:21.210> seven

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
seed has a total of seven state seven

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.919 
seed has a total of seven state seven
different<00:01:22.020> places<00:01:23.390> so<00:01:24.390> after<00:01:24.659> you've<00:01:24.780> done

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:24.929 
different places so after you've done

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:32.809 
different places so after you've done
that<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.409> set<00:01:25.710> up<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.979> simple<00:01:26.600> see<00:01:27.600> plant<00:01:31.819> and

00:01:32.809 --> 00:01:32.819 
that you set up a simple see plant and

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:39.080 
that you set up a simple see plant and
now<00:01:32.940> you<00:01:33.000> need<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.270> make<00:01:33.479> actual<00:01:34.080> events<00:01:37.700> so<00:01:38.700> we

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
now you need to make actual events so we

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.419 
now you need to make actual events so we
so<00:01:39.450> go<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.659> your<00:01:39.810> event<00:01:40.140> manifold<00:01:40.679> with<00:01:41.250> this

00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:41.429 
so go to your event manifold with this

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:44.770 
so go to your event manifold with this
project<00:01:41.700> it's<00:01:42.119> for<00:01:42.539> this<00:01:42.659> some<00:01:42.869> example<00:01:43.409> it's

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
project it's for this some example it's

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.949 
project it's for this some example it's
for<00:01:45.780> this<00:01:45.929> example<00:01:46.289> it's<00:01:46.560> mapped<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:48.119> make

00:01:48.949 --> 00:01:48.959 
for this example it's mapped to and make

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:50.690 
for this example it's mapped to and make
a<00:01:48.990> new<00:01:49.229> event<00:01:49.380> now<00:01:49.890> it's<00:01:50.009> important<00:01:50.490> now<00:01:50.640> the

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
a new event now it's important now the

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.480 
a new event now it's important now the
event<00:01:51.090> must<00:01:51.360> have<00:01:51.569> the<00:01:51.750> same<00:01:52.049> name<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.679> the

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
event must have the same name of the

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.039 
event must have the same name of the
item<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.060> that's<00:01:54.360> being<00:01:54.689> associated

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
item that is that's being associated

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.779 
item that is that's being associated
with<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.709> that<00:01:55.799> needs<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.039> be<00:01:56.189> followed<00:01:56.490> by<00:01:56.640> an

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
with and that needs to be followed by an

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:59.960 
with and that needs to be followed by an
interval<00:01:58.039> I'll<00:01:59.039> explain<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.580> integer<00:01:59.940> a

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
interval I'll explain the integer a

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.770 
interval I'll explain the integer a
little<00:02:00.239> bit<00:02:00.330> more<00:02:00.479> later<00:02:02.300> okay<00:02:03.300> now<00:02:03.450> beyond

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
little bit more later okay now beyond

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.320 
little bit more later okay now beyond
the<00:02:04.739> event<00:02:05.039> needs<00:02:05.220> to<00:02:05.340> be<00:02:05.399> organized<00:02:05.940> in<00:02:06.179> this

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
the event needs to be organized in this

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.270 
the event needs to be organized in this
in<00:02:06.539> this<00:02:06.599> very<00:02:06.869> specific<00:02:07.410> way<00:02:07.590> since<00:02:08.099> our

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
in this very specific way since our

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.220 
in this very specific way since our
plant<00:02:08.610> has<00:02:10.610> each<00:02:11.610> each<00:02:12.030> event<00:02:12.420> represents

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
plant has each each event represents

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.350 
plant has each each event represents
fought<00:02:13.800> can<00:02:14.040> represent<00:02:14.310> a<00:02:14.459> maximum<00:02:15.060> of<00:02:15.150> five

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
fought can represent a maximum of five

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.020

to<00:02:59.260> do<00:02:59.440> it<00:02:59.620> just<00:02:59.860> it's<00:03:00.460> just<00:03:00.670> going<00:03:00.880> to<00:03:00.940> iterate

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
to do it just it's just going to iterate

through each of these pages each page
represents<00:03:04.330> one<00:03:04.570> stage<00:03:04.900> so<00:03:04.930> we<00:03:05.380> have<00:03:05.470> a

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
represents one stage so we have a

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.670 
represents one stage so we have a
maximum<00:03:05.980> of<00:03:06.190> five<00:03:06.460> stages<00:03:06.880> partly<00:03:10.410> because<00:03:11.410> we

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
maximum of five stages partly because we

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.060 
maximum of five stages partly because we
set<00:03:11.890> our<00:03:12.010> our<00:03:12.310> own<00:03:12.490> growth<00:03:12.850> rate<00:03:13.150> to<00:03:13.810> 60<00:03:14.620> it's

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
set our our own growth rate to 60 it's

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.650 
set our our own growth rate to 60 it's
going<00:03:15.400> to<00:03:15.490> be<00:03:15.730> on<00:03:15.880> skype<00:03:16.120> is<00:03:16.300> going<00:03:16.450> to<00:03:16.510> iterate

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
going to be on skype is going to iterate

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.360 
going to be on skype is going to iterate

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
through each page every 60 frames so now

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.860 
through each page every 60 frames so now
we<00:03:21.430> just<00:03:21.550> want<00:03:21.790> to<00:03:21.910> look<00:03:22.090> like<00:03:22.300> make<00:03:22.600> it<00:03:22.720> look

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
we just want to look like make it look

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:32.760 
we just want to look like make it look
like<00:03:23.080> the<00:03:23.350> tomato<00:03:24.340> plant<00:03:24.610> is<00:03:24.790> grown

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.620 

and<00:03:33.280> all<00:03:33.430> I'm<00:03:33.550> doing<00:03:33.850> right<00:03:33.970> now<00:03:34.150> is<00:03:34.330> I'm<00:03:34.420> just

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
and all I'm doing right now is I'm just

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.960 
and all I'm doing right now is I'm just
trying<00:03:34.870> trying<00:03:35.290> to<00:03:35.790> use

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.510 

graphics<00:03:41.780> that<00:03:41.900> make<00:03:42.110> it<00:03:42.230> look<00:03:42.350> like

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
graphics that make it look like

00:03:43.520 --> 00:04:11.910 
graphics that make it look like
groans

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.130 

okay<00:04:12.610> so<00:04:12.670> that's<00:04:13.090> our<00:04:13.209> first<00:04:13.420> five<00:04:13.660> stage<00:04:13.959> of

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
okay so that's our first five stage of

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.289 
okay so that's our first five stage of
growth<00:04:14.349> for<00:04:14.680> our<00:04:14.709> tomato<00:04:15.099> seed<00:04:15.490> or<00:04:15.760> tomato

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
growth for our tomato seed or tomato

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.870 
growth for our tomato seed or tomato
plant<00:04:16.799> and<00:04:17.799> that<00:04:18.130> kind<00:04:18.370> of<00:04:18.400> wood<00:04:18.549> is<00:04:18.579> going<00:04:18.820> to

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
plant and that kind of wood is going to

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.190 
plant and that kind of wood is going to
look<00:04:19.060> like<00:04:19.090> when<00:04:19.329> it's<00:04:19.510> grown<00:04:21.780> so<00:04:22.780> after<00:04:22.930> we've

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
look like when it's grown so after we've

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.170 
look like when it's grown so after we've
done<00:04:23.350> that<00:04:23.410> since<00:04:23.950> our<00:04:24.310> tomato<00:04:24.669> seed<00:04:24.970> had

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
done that since our tomato seed had

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.180 
done that since our tomato seed had
seven<00:04:25.600> stages<00:04:25.810> not<00:04:26.200> five<00:04:26.500> we<00:04:26.770> need<00:04:26.919> to<00:04:27.040> make

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
seven stages not five we need to make

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.629 
seven stages not five we need to make
another<00:04:27.460> event<00:04:28.919> you<00:04:29.919> need<00:04:30.070> to<00:04:30.130> name<00:04:30.280> it<00:04:30.400> tomato

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
another event you need to name it tomato

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.270 
another event you need to name it tomato
soon<00:04:30.940> we<00:04:31.180> need<00:04:31.210> to<00:04:31.650> follow<00:04:32.650> that<00:04:32.919> by<00:04:33.160> an

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
soon we need to follow that by an

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.100 
soon we need to follow that by an
integer<00:04:33.580> and<00:04:33.970> the<00:04:34.240> here's<00:04:34.450> where<00:04:34.630> the<00:04:34.720> integer

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
integer and the here's where the integer

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.170 
integer and the here's where the integer
comes<00:04:35.350> in<00:04:35.500> play<00:04:35.680> this<00:04:35.919> tells<00:04:36.190> this<00:04:36.730> tells<00:04:37.030> the

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
comes in play this tells this tells the

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.680 
comes in play this tells this tells the
own<00:04:37.450> script<00:04:37.870> which<00:04:38.139> order<00:04:39.240> which<00:04:40.240> order<00:04:40.570> to

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
own script which order which order to

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.110 
own script which order which order to
use<00:04:40.870> what<00:04:41.050> you<00:04:41.230> medicine<00:04:41.820> so<00:04:42.820> it's<00:04:42.940> going<00:04:43.030> to

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
use what you medicine so it's going to

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.510 
use what you medicine so it's going to
use<00:04:43.330> the<00:04:43.540> UM<00:04:43.780> tomato<00:04:44.169> seed<00:04:44.500> one<00:04:44.919> even<00:04:45.250> worse

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
use the UM tomato seed one even worse

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.050 
use the UM tomato seed one even worse
then<00:04:45.820> going<00:04:46.060> to<00:04:46.120> go<00:04:46.210> to<00:04:46.270> tomato<00:04:46.750> seed<00:04:47.020> to<00:04:48.060> need

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
then going to go to tomato seed to need

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.510 
then going to go to tomato seed to need
to<00:04:49.210> organize<00:04:49.720> the<00:04:49.960> event<00:04:50.889> in<00:04:51.100> the<00:04:51.160> same<00:04:51.370> way

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
to organize the event in the same way

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.070 
to organize the event in the same way
that<00:04:51.639> we<00:04:51.700> did<00:04:51.760> the<00:04:51.970> last<00:04:52.000> one<00:04:52.330> the<00:04:52.450> first<00:04:52.840> page

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
that we did the last one the first page

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.080 
that we did the last one the first page
has<00:04:53.290> not<00:04:53.590> requires<00:04:53.979> nothing<00:04:54.250> on<00:04:54.550> the<00:04:54.700> second

now we should be able to give the player

00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:30.829 
now we should be able to give the player
a<00:05:28.409> tomato<00:05:29.189> seed<00:05:29.699> item<00:05:30.179> and<00:05:30.389> the<00:05:30.599> players

00:05:30.829 --> 00:05:30.839 
a tomato seed item and the players

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:32.719 
a tomato seed item and the players
should<00:05:30.959> be<00:05:31.229> able<00:05:31.289> to<00:05:31.469> plant<00:05:31.739> it<00:05:31.949> and<00:05:32.069> should<00:05:32.489> be

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729 
should be able to plant it and should be

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:40.749 
should be able to plant it and should be
able<00:05:32.789> to<00:05:32.969> grow<00:05:33.239> so<00:05:33.809> let's<00:05:34.019> see<00:05:34.229> if<00:05:34.319> that<00:05:34.529> works

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:40.759 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:56.629 

I'm<00:05:41.759> just<00:05:42.089> making<00:05:42.479> an<00:05:42.569> event

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:07.389 

okay<00:05:57.330> so<00:05:57.389> now<00:05:57.569> is<00:05:57.719> good

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:07.399 

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:14.299 

and<00:06:08.399> our<00:06:09.360> tomato<00:06:09.689> seeds<00:06:09.959> grow<00:06:12.829> and<00:06:13.829> once<00:06:14.159> it

00:06:14.299 --> 00:06:14.309 
and our tomato seeds grow and once it

00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:16.519 
and our tomato seeds grow and once it
gets<00:06:14.459> the<00:06:14.669> full<00:06:14.819> tomato<00:06:15.179> it<00:06:15.389> stops<00:06:15.659> and<00:06:16.019> that's

00:06:16.519 --> 00:06:16.529 
gets the full tomato it stops and that's

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:18.379 
gets the full tomato it stops and that's
how<00:06:16.679> you<00:06:16.739> make<00:06:16.889> a<00:06:16.949> simple<00:06:17.279> plan<00:06:17.610> if<00:06:17.999> you<00:06:18.089> want

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:18.389
