00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:10.130
Hey guys Bignate84 here

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.500
You probably thought this was a different
type of video

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.870
Well this is a family show and there will
be no clothes falling off

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.250
This is my wardrobe malfunction

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.000
The broken wardrobe seen here is a Grey Clothes
Closet

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.550
I got from the Container Store for about 60
bucks

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.199
And after about a month the weight of my clothes
was too much

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:35.030
For the cheap plastic frame and it snapped

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.750
One of the selling points of this product
is, and I quote

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.429
“4-sided steel frame construction”

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:43.140
I really don’t know how they can say that
legally

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.819
If the steel frame is held together by brittle
plastic

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:50.769
To be completely honest I probably hung too
much stuff on it

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:55.760
That said I did not see a weight limit anywhere
so it is kind of a guessing game

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.249
As to how much weight this product can actually
handle

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:00.719
If you’re considering buying one of these

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.350
Just be careful not to put too much weight
on it

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.000
The 4-sided steel frame construction will
break at the weakest point which is plastic

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.420
If this has happened to you and you’re a
do-it-yourself kind of person

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.439
Don’t worry about the fact that you just
blew 60 bucks here’s how to fix it

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:24.189
All you need is two 20 inch 2x4’s, a power
drill, drill bit set, and a saw

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:26.500
I used the broken plastic frame as a guide

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.000
For where the holes should be drilled into
the wood

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.520
The support rods will require an 11/16”
drill bit for a snug fit in the wood

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.890
The center hanging rod is slightly bigger
and will require a ¾” drill bit

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.170
Your holes should go almost all the way through
the 2x4 frame

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.789
And the steel rods will press fit into the
holes

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:51.719
You’ll want to cut off the upper corners
of the 2x4’s with a saw

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:54.499
So that the wood will fit inside the canvas
more easily

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:57.520
And while you’re at it you may want to take
some sandpaper

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.219
And soften the corners of the wood so it does
not rip through the canvas

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:07.600
Fair warning: if you do attempt this fix it
is very difficult

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.780
To finagle the frame and the wood into place

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.440
You may want to have a helper

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.390
Hold up the canvas while you put everything
together

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.690
It can be done by one person, I did it myself

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.280
But it definitely tested my patience a little
bit

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.050
So that’s my wardrobe malfunction and how
I fixed it

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.050
Thanks for watching

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.450
I set up an email feed through FeedBurner
so that anyone with an email address

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.870
Can get a simple notification when I upload
a new video

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.950
If you go to my channel or look in the description
of any one of my videos

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.560
You will see a link that says “Get The Email”

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.260
You don’t need to have a YouTube account

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.750
Any email address will work

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.230
Here’s an example of what the email looks
like
