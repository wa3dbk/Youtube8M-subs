need to do this is a memory card reader

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.729 
need to do this is a memory card reader
or<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:54.090> computer<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.809> has<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.050> memory<00:00:55.500> card

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
or a computer that has a memory card

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.430 
or a computer that has a memory card
reader<00:00:55.949> built<00:00:56.550> in<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.969> have<00:00:57.120> one<00:00:57.329> like<00:00:57.600> right<00:00:58.410> on

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
reader built in I have one like right on

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.040 
reader built in I have one like right on
the<00:00:58.620> side<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:58.890> my<00:00:59.070> laptop<00:00:59.309> here<00:00:59.730> but<00:01:00.719> what's

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
the side of my laptop here but what's

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.599 
the side of my laptop here but what's
even<00:01:01.140> better<00:01:01.320> is<00:01:01.649> if<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.829> have<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.070> card<00:01:02.460> reader

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
even better is if you have a card reader

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.149 
even better is if you have a card reader
and<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.899> computer<00:01:03.930> with<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.470> card<00:01:05.010> reader

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
and the computer with a card reader

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.800 
and the computer with a card reader
built<00:01:05.489> in<00:01:05.729> because<00:01:06.060> then<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.330> can<00:01:06.450> do<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:06.659> in

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
built in because then you can do this in

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.960 
built in because then you can do this in
one<00:01:06.960> shot<00:01:07.260> instead<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.740> doing<00:01:08.310> back<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.700> forth

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
one shot instead of doing back and forth

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.359 
one shot instead of doing back and forth
and<00:01:09.240> etc<00:01:09.840> etc<00:01:09.990> but<00:01:11.299> in<00:01:12.299> any<00:01:12.479> case<00:01:13.250> Nintendo<00:01:14.250> was

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
and etc etc but in any case Nintendo was

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.070 
and etc etc but in any case Nintendo was
kind<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.729> known<00:01:14.880> for<00:01:14.909> making<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.810> really

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
kind of known for making it really

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.649 
kind of known for making it really
difficult<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.820> copy<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.090> transfer<00:01:18.420> things

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
difficult to copy and transfer things

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.050 
difficult to copy and transfer things
from<00:01:18.840> one<00:01:19.020> device<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.320> another<00:01:19.880> except<00:01:20.880> when

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
from one device to another except when

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.330 
from one device to another except when
it<00:01:21.150> comes<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.600> swapping<00:01:22.470> memory<00:01:22.770> cards<00:01:23.070> for

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
it comes to swapping memory cards for

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.300 
it comes to swapping memory cards for
some<00:01:23.490> strange<00:01:23.790> reason<00:01:24.229> this<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.500> ridiculously

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
some strange reason this is ridiculously

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.630 
some strange reason this is ridiculously
simple<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:27.200> don't<00:01:28.200> know<00:01:28.290> why<00:01:28.500> Nintendo<00:01:29.130> didn't

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
simple I don't know why Nintendo didn't

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.240 
simple I don't know why Nintendo didn't
do<00:01:29.759> anything<00:01:30.000> kind<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.570> screwy<00:01:30.869> for<00:01:31.259> this

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
do anything kind of screwy for this

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.730 
do anything kind of screwy for this
transfer<00:01:32.970> process<00:01:33.329> but<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:33.960> literally

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
transfer process but it is literally

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.319 
transfer process but it is literally
like<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:37.020> fastest<00:01:37.439> thing<00:01:37.590> I've<00:01:37.799> ever<00:01:37.920> done

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
like the fastest thing I've ever done

all you really have to do is take the SD

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.359 
all you really have to do is take the SD
card<00:01:41.310> out<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.210> 3ds<00:01:42.710> pop<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.860> in<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.040> computer

five four ish okay so the countdown

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.260 
five four ish okay so the countdown
doesn't<00:04:40.040> like<00:04:40.160> to<00:04:40.280> work<00:04:40.490> yay<00:04:41.300> windows<00:04:43.030> but<00:04:44.030> in

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
doesn't like to work yay windows but in

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.450 
doesn't like to work yay windows but in
any<00:04:44.389> case<00:04:44.479> just<00:04:45.470> about<00:04:45.710> done<00:04:46.210> poof

any case just about done poof
so<00:04:49.460> now<00:04:53.139> there's<00:04:54.139> 32<00:04:54.860> gig<00:04:55.220> card<00:04:56.830> all<00:04:57.830> we<00:04:58.100> do<00:04:58.250> pop

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
so now there's 32 gig card all we do pop

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:05.439 
so now there's 32 gig card all we do pop
it<00:04:58.729> back<00:04:58.760> in<00:05:03.820> sorry<00:05:04.820> again

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:09.460 
it back in sorry again
one-handed<00:05:05.930> this<00:05:06.110> is<00:05:06.260> kind<00:05:06.560> of<00:05:06.590> hard<00:05:08.470> clicky

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
one-handed this is kind of hard clicky

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:16.870 
one-handed this is kind of hard clicky
clicky<00:05:09.979> shut<00:05:10.340> the<00:05:10.460> door<00:05:14.530> open<00:05:15.530> in<00:05:15.650> 3s<00:05:16.130> and<00:05:16.490> turn

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
clicky shut the door open in 3s and turn

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:27.519 
clicky shut the door open in 3s and turn
it<00:05:17.000> back<00:05:17.150> on<00:05:17.419> now<00:05:20.740> once<00:05:21.740> it<00:05:21.889> boots<00:05:22.070> up

00:05:27.519 --> 00:05:27.529 

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:30.969 

there<00:05:28.219> you<00:05:28.369> go<00:05:29.169> everything<00:05:30.169> still<00:05:30.559> seems<00:05:30.919> to

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:30.979 
there you go everything still seems to

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:34.569 
there you go everything still seems to
be<00:05:31.069> here<00:05:32.619> one<00:05:33.619> thing<00:05:33.829> that<00:05:34.009> you<00:05:34.129> can<00:05:34.309> really

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:34.579 
be here one thing that you can really

00:05:34.579 --> 00:05:36.729 
be here one thing that you can really
use<00:05:34.699> to<00:05:34.879> test<00:05:35.119> is<00:05:35.359> if<00:05:35.479> you<00:05:35.569> have<00:05:35.779> games<00:05:36.169> on<00:05:36.499> here

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:36.739 
use to test is if you have games on here

00:05:36.739 --> 00:05:38.589 
use to test is if you have games on here
that<00:05:36.979> we're<00:05:37.249> safe<00:05:37.489> to<00:05:37.669> the<00:05:37.699> memory<00:05:38.179> card<00:05:38.209> I

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:38.599 
that we're safe to the memory card I

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:40.869 
that we're safe to the memory card I
have<00:05:39.079> the<00:05:39.259> demo<00:05:39.739> version<00:05:39.979> of<00:05:40.249> Tomodachi<00:05:40.729> life

00:05:40.869 --> 00:05:40.879 
have the demo version of Tomodachi life

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:43.509 
have the demo version of Tomodachi life
right<00:05:41.269> there<00:05:41.539> now<00:05:42.469> if<00:05:42.769> this<00:05:43.009> hadn't<00:05:43.369> worked

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:43.519 
right there now if this hadn't worked

00:05:43.519 --> 00:05:46.599 
right there now if this hadn't worked
this<00:05:43.969> would<00:05:44.239> be<00:05:44.449> here<00:05:44.719> and<00:05:45.309> it<00:05:46.309> wouldn't<00:05:46.489> be

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:46.609 
this would be here and it wouldn't be

00:05:46.609 --> 00:05:49.569 
this would be here and it wouldn't be
running<00:05:46.759> so<00:05:48.099> there<00:05:49.099> you<00:05:49.219> go

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:49.579 
running so there you go

00:05:49.579 --> 00:05:52.629 
running so there you go
fastest<00:05:50.569> way<00:05:50.689> to<00:05:51.039> transfer<00:05:52.039> stuff<00:05:52.279> from<00:05:52.429> one

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:52.639 
fastest way to transfer stuff from one

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:54.159 
fastest way to transfer stuff from one
memory<00:05:52.849> card<00:05:53.089> to<00:05:53.209> another<00:05:53.329> I<00:05:53.569> just<00:05:53.659> did<00:05:54.049> it

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:54.169 
memory card to another I just did it

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:56.609 
memory card to another I just did it
boom<00:05:54.889> done

00:05:56.609 --> 00:05:56.619 
boom done

00:05:56.619 --> 00:06:00.669 
boom done
so<00:05:57.619> there<00:05:58.579> you<00:05:58.609> go<00:05:58.699> if<00:05:59.059> you<00:05:59.419> have<00:05:59.929> a<00:06:00.259> small

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:00.679 
so there you go if you have a small

00:06:00.679 --> 00:06:02.289 
so there you go if you have a small
memory<00:06:00.859> card<00:06:01.249> and<00:06:01.399> you<00:06:01.489> want<00:06:01.729> to<00:06:01.849> put<00:06:01.999> a<00:06:02.029> bigger

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:02.299 
memory card and you want to put a bigger

00:06:02.299 --> 00:06:04.509 
memory card and you want to put a bigger
memory<00:06:02.539> card<00:06:02.929> that's<00:06:03.469> it<00:06:03.799> how<00:06:03.979> you<00:06:04.039> apologize

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:04.519 
memory card that's it how you apologize

00:06:04.519 --> 00:06:05.859 
memory card that's it how you apologize
for<00:06:04.819> the<00:06:05.029> length<00:06:05.179> of<00:06:05.239> this<00:06:05.329> video<00:06:05.659> really

00:06:05.859 --> 00:06:05.869 
for the length of this video really

00:06:05.869 --> 00:06:08.439 
for the length of this video really
doesn't<00:06:06.259> need<00:06:06.379> to<00:06:06.519> take<00:06:07.519> this<00:06:07.729> length<00:06:08.059> of<00:06:08.209> time

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:08.449 
doesn't need to take this length of time

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:11.169 
doesn't need to take this length of time
to<00:06:08.659> get<00:06:08.779> this<00:06:08.899> to<00:06:09.079> work<00:06:09.229> but<00:06:09.969> showing<00:06:10.969> a

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:11.179 
to get this to work but showing a

00:06:11.179 --> 00:06:13.569 
to get this to work but showing a
process<00:06:11.689> without<00:06:12.109> like<00:06:12.619> fancy<00:06:13.009> software<00:06:13.219> and

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:13.579 
process without like fancy software and

00:06:13.579 --> 00:06:17.379 
process without like fancy software and
yeah<00:06:14.019> you<00:06:15.019> get<00:06:15.199> the<00:06:15.229> idea<00:06:15.649> but<00:06:16.119> this<00:06:17.119> will

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:17.389 
yeah you get the idea but this will

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:19.569 
yeah you get the idea but this will
especially<00:06:17.629> come<00:06:18.079> in<00:06:18.229> handy<00:06:18.589> if<00:06:18.799> you<00:06:19.159> have<00:06:19.549> a

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:19.579 
especially come in handy if you have a

00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:21.279 
especially come in handy if you have a
tendency<00:06:19.939> to<00:06:20.089> download<00:06:20.629> a<00:06:20.659> lot<00:06:20.929> of<00:06:21.049> stuff

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:21.289 
tendency to download a lot of stuff

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:23.889 
tendency to download a lot of stuff
because<00:06:22.039> the<00:06:22.249> original<00:06:22.669> memory<00:06:22.939> cards<00:06:23.269> will

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:23.899 
because the original memory cards will

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:26.619 
because the original memory cards will
fill<00:06:24.169> up<00:06:24.339> incredibly<00:06:25.339> fast<00:06:25.579> so<00:06:25.969> I<00:06:26.179> highly

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:26.629 
fill up incredibly fast so I highly

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:28.389 
fill up incredibly fast so I highly
recommend<00:06:26.689> getting<00:06:27.199> a<00:06:27.319> hold<00:06:27.529> of<00:06:27.649> a<00:06:27.739> 32<00:06:28.159> gig

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:28.399 
recommend getting a hold of a 32 gig

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:30.459 
recommend getting a hold of a 32 gig
card<00:06:28.429> I<00:06:28.879> haven't<00:06:29.299> tried<00:06:29.449> anything<00:06:29.749> bigger<00:06:30.199> I'm

00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:30.469 
card I haven't tried anything bigger I'm

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:33.279 
card I haven't tried anything bigger I'm
not<00:06:31.219> sure<00:06:31.369> if<00:06:31.489> that<00:06:31.639> works<00:06:31.879> but<00:06:32.449> it<00:06:32.749> may<00:06:32.989> may

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:33.289 
not sure if that works but it may may

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:36.279 
not sure if that works but it may may
not<00:06:33.319> I<00:06:33.649> don't<00:06:33.769> know<00:06:33.919> but<00:06:34.629> 32<00:06:35.629> gig<00:06:35.899> is<00:06:36.079> the

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:36.289 
not I don't know but 32 gig is the

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:38.199 
not I don't know but 32 gig is the
biggest<00:06:36.619> that<00:06:36.709> I<00:06:36.769> have<00:06:37.309> tested<00:06:37.849> and<00:06:37.969> I<00:06:38.029> know

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:38.209 
biggest that I have tested and I know

00:06:38.209 --> 00:06:39.789 
biggest that I have tested and I know
works<00:06:38.509> otherwise<00:06:38.989> this<00:06:39.289> game<00:06:39.469> wouldn't<00:06:39.679> be

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:39.799 
works otherwise this game wouldn't be

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:42.850 
works otherwise this game wouldn't be
running<00:06:40.089> but<00:06:41.289> yeah<00:06:42.289> there<00:06:42.619> you<00:06:42.709> go

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:42.860 
running but yeah there you go

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.409 
running but yeah there you go
so<00:06:43.299> thanks<00:06:44.299> for<00:06:44.419> watching<00:06:44.749> see<00:06:45.110> you<00:06:45.199> later
