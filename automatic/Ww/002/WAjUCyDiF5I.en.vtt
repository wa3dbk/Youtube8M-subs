00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:07.430
 even with a blade 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:38.640
 even that of pride boh 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.600
 because the but all girls here we are 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.600
 with a new one 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.239
 I don't know for this as we are a 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:49.680
 spit out a beautiful one though 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.109
 spit 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:57.170
 I was thinking of calling a swarm a 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:57.170
 live show man life show champ in a live 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:06.869
 Oh God no we start well there are echoes 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.610
 at least a little bit around I swear that yes 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.319
 i'm asleep and like midnight e 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.789
 half in the vote but I would n't know 

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:13.259
 so much are but obviously not 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:14.670
 never be able to sleep at this time 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.470
 I put from there I am relaxed I have to 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.580
 play call of duty black ops 2 that 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:23.310
 so even if I get angry there are 3 May 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.229
 reason but I thought only disc put 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.530
 relaxed if I die one by 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.929
 swarm I don't get angry 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:34.909
 I thought badly no joke we are 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:34.909
 enjoy a relaxed gameplay but do 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.209
 quiet trumpy there is still all 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:45.270
 time 

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:47.430
 we are also two swarms no no no raga is 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.149
 the first one as they are all 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:56.399
 the same points and then you do n't have to 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:58.580
 anger madonna santa and kill him 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.520
 run shoot 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.440
 come on fast go what thing for everything 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.960
 as well as in slow motion like the demented 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.869
 to put in my class the monna for 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.240
 we work so at least we have some 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.470
 active actions to this gameplay that 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.120
 it is obvious that you too fall asleep 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.910
 the sleeping type voice lies 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:22.250
 so you will already be sleeping with drool 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:24.020
 to the mouth but I found 1 so much there 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:36.700
 they catch c then I make the rounds from 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:39.020
 covi covi and ai and then how it is that 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:43.130
 they were falling, they took the 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:45.950
 persona ti suu kyi anyway because me 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:49.300
 I hope also by chance then imagine a 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.300
 how you are awake 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.580
 we are winning well 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.810
 there is reality is a question that has become 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.730
 an affirmation but I realized that 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.500
 we were winning 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.590
 not that we need a genius, however, we are 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.060
 by capturing all the flags you will have 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.020
 we leave there at the top I saw that guy 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.020
 is that I want to kill her 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.860
 let's take some jackal 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:24.460
 we stock up on the bodies of others 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.460
 I don't lie down 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.790
 oh God 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.500
 there is a site of its own ie I don't have any 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.210
 you know that I usually comment 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.040
 that is, always even if you lose the 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.110
 I always talk about gameplay though I am 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.710
 relaxed so we're a bit relaxed 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:53.220
 we call ourselves a hub and get a nice one 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.220
 get out 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:04.960
 well by 13 be I have to recover mine 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.600
 radio because as you know we are aiming 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.750
 on points per minute like that 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.520
 novate but I couldn't catch them aiming 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.470
 just points per minute to hurry 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.910
 the levels etc but now we're done 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.940
 we can take care a little robbed or 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.800
 certainly type 165 so I'll do mi.mo.se 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.310
 poet not only do I make you like acer 

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:26.680
 high road to radio to get to 2 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.620
 that's enough because the rest was me 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.860
 give nothing sincerely because the rat 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.140
 it shows nothing especially because 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.250
 me if I am on xbox I do not find more than 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.650
 much 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.840
 maybe if I will do a series on ps3 that is if 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:45.250
 take it game on ps3 then we'll type 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:47.830

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.290

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.260
