00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
play with and remix and resample and so

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.949 
play with and remix and resample and so
it<00:03:43.160> so<00:03:43.400> it<00:03:43.520> was<00:03:43.700> really<00:03:43.730> a<00:03:44.060> very<00:03:45.160> organic<00:03:46.160> and

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
it so it was really a very organic and

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.050 
it so it was really a very organic and
exploratory<00:03:47.959> process<00:03:48.520> working<00:03:49.520> with<00:03:49.670> a<00:03:49.790> lot

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
exploratory process working with a lot

exploratory process working with a lot
of<00:03:50.090> musicians

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.380 

I<00:03:55.230> think<00:03:56.230> that<00:03:56.380> I<00:03:56.620> think<00:03:56.800> the<00:03:57.180> there's<00:03:58.180> more

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
I think that I think the there's more

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.090 
I think that I think the there's more
similarity<00:03:59.290> between<00:03:59.500> the<00:03:59.830> home<00:03:59.950> world

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100
