rubbed<00:01:27.540> off<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:28.290> maybe<00:01:28.470> not<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.680> lighter<00:01:28.950> color

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
rubbed off so maybe not a lighter color

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.350 
rubbed off so maybe not a lighter color
like<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:29.460> but<00:01:29.670> like<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.820> said<00:01:29.909> there's<00:01:30.090> 50

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
like this but like I said there's 50

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.420 
different colors and styles of leather
to<00:01:32.490> pick<00:01:32.729> from<00:01:32.880> they<00:01:33.030> range<00:01:33.210> from<00:01:33.390> $60<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.430> 169

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
to pick from they range from $60 to 169

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.100 
to pick from they range from $60 to 169
dollars<00:01:35.820> from<00:01:35.939> for<00:01:36.240> like<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.479> real<00:01:36.689> premium

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
dollars from for like the real premium

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.440 
dollars from for like the real premium
leather<00:01:37.350> which<00:01:38.040> is<00:01:38.280> kind<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:38.909> ridiculous

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
leather which is kind of ridiculous

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.520 
leather which is kind of ridiculous
maybe<00:01:39.659> think<00:01:39.869> about<00:01:40.049> that's<00:01:40.259> pretty

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
maybe think about that's pretty

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.319 
maybe think about that's pretty
expensive<00:01:40.770> but<00:01:41.610> if<00:01:41.970> you're<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.150> type<00:01:42.210> of

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
expensive but if you're the type of

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.030 
expensive but if you're the type of
person<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.689> only<00:01:42.810> use<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.049> one<00:01:43.259> case<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.920> you

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
but let's go and talk about the case

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.910 
but let's go and talk about the case
let's<00:01:48.960> put<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.229> phone<00:01:49.380> in<00:01:49.530> two<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.710> them<00:01:49.799> so

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
let's put the phone in two of them so

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.679 
let's put the phone in two of them so
you<00:01:50.009> show<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.670> just<00:01:50.790> basically<00:01:51.000> pops<00:01:51.450> into

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
you show you it just basically pops into

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.960 
you show you it just basically pops into
their<00:01:51.869> corners<00:01:52.259> there<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.649> then<00:01:53.579> there's

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
their corners there and then there's

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.219 
their corners there and then there's
just<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.210> class<00:01:54.450> there's<00:01:54.659> no<00:01:54.750> kind<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:54.960> hook<00:01:55.110> or

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
just a class there's no kind of hook or

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.780 
just a class there's no kind of hook or
anything<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.530> just<00:01:55.560> like<00:01:55.860> rests<00:01:56.399> on<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.610> top

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
anything I just like rests on the top

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.999 
anything I just like rests on the top
right<00:01:56.939> there<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:58.020> could<00:01:58.229> over<00:01:58.560> time<00:01:58.770> this

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
right there so it could over time this

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.319 
right there so it could over time this
piece<00:01:59.280> right<00:01:59.430> here<00:01:59.490> could<00:01:59.729> get<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.060> little<00:02:00.180> bit

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
piece right here could get a little bit

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.149 
piece right here could get a little bit
loose<00:02:00.509> if<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.990> keep<00:02:01.259> opening<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:01.770> closing

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
loose if you keep opening and closing

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.800 
loose if you keep opening and closing
after<00:02:02.399> like<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.759> year<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.299> would<00:02:03.479> see<00:02:03.659> that

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
after like a year so I would see that

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.480 
after like a year so I would see that
maybe<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.140> would<00:02:04.229> not<00:02:04.530> have<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.799> same<00:02:04.979> grip<00:02:05.310> as

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
maybe it would not have the same grip as

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.580 
maybe it would not have the same grip as
it<00:02:05.640> does<00:02:05.790> right<00:02:05.939> here<00:02:06.060> but<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:07.170> only<00:02:07.350> time

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
it does right here but that only time

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.900 
it does right here but that only time
would<00:02:07.740> tell<00:02:07.799> them<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.039> I've<00:02:08.280> used<00:02:08.459> similar

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
would tell them that I've used similar

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.400 
would tell them that I've used similar
stock<00:02:09.090> cases<00:02:09.450> before<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.810> I've<00:02:09.899> been<00:02:10.110> fine

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
stock cases before and I've been fine

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.710 
stock cases before and I've been fine
and<00:02:10.739> even<00:02:11.160> though<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.430> Norns<00:02:12.030> cases<00:02:12.420> I've<00:02:12.540> used

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
and even though of Norns cases I've used

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.970 
and even though of Norns cases I've used
their<00:02:12.840> other<00:02:12.989> cases<00:02:13.230> in<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.530> past<00:02:13.650> as<00:02:13.860> well

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
their other cases in the past as well

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:14.720 
their other cases in the past as well
and<00:02:14.099> it's

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
and it's

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.220 
and it's
pretty<00:02:15.090> well<00:02:15.239> but<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.510> just<00:02:15.629> think<00:02:15.959> over<00:02:16.110> time

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
pretty well but I just think over time

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.199 
pretty well but I just think over time
you<00:02:16.620> know<00:02:16.739> naturally<00:02:17.459> this<00:02:17.610> this<00:02:17.849> piece<00:02:18.030> right

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
you know naturally this this piece right

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:19.369 
you know naturally this this piece right
here<00:02:18.269> just<00:02:18.480> gonna<00:02:18.629> get<00:02:18.780> loosened<00:02:19.140> may<00:02:19.230> not

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
here just gonna get loosened may not

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.380 
here just gonna get loosened may not
clasp<00:02:19.650> on<00:02:19.950> there<00:02:20.129> as<00:02:20.280> easily<00:02:20.790> as<00:02:21.030> it<00:02:21.120> does<00:02:21.269> now

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
clasp on there as easily as it does now

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.970 
clasp on there as easily as it does now
so<00:02:21.870> when<00:02:22.019> it<00:02:22.110> is<00:02:22.200> in<00:02:22.349> there<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:22.500> can<00:02:22.769> get<00:02:22.860> to

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
so when it is in there you can get to

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.500 
so when it is in there you can get to
the<00:02:23.069> standby<00:02:23.310> switch<00:02:23.489> it's<00:02:23.940> not<00:02:24.090> blocked<00:02:24.360> off

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
the clothes so you have to open it up

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:43.850 
the clothes so you have to open it up
and<00:02:42.870> you'll<00:02:42.959> be<00:02:42.989> able<00:02:43.110> to<00:02:43.260> get<00:02:43.349> to<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.500> speaker

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
just you know sitting on the side table

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:50.420 
just you know sitting on the side table
you<00:02:49.290> can't<00:02:49.500> have<00:02:49.620> it<00:02:49.739> closed<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.099> charge<00:02:50.310> it

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
you can't have it closed and charge it

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
though and there is a little bit of a

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.660 
though and there is a little bit of a
delay<00:02:52.410> on<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.590> table<00:02:52.829> design<00:02:52.920> but<00:02:53.280> not<00:02:53.459> by

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
delay on the table design but not by

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.250 
delay on the table design but not by
much<00:02:53.879> it's<00:02:54.090> pretty<00:02:54.390> close<00:02:54.690> there's<00:02:55.019> not<00:02:55.140> much

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
much it's pretty close there's not much

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.599 
much it's pretty close there's not much
of<00:02:55.379> a<00:02:55.440> lip<00:02:55.620> on<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:55.829> edge<00:02:55.859> or<00:02:56.069> so<00:02:56.160> if<00:02:56.220> you<00:02:56.280> do<00:02:56.400> put

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
of a lip on the edge or so if you do put

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.430 
of a lip on the edge or so if you do put
a<00:02:56.640> face<00:02:56.819> down<00:02:57.060> if<00:02:57.450> you<00:02:57.780> throw<00:02:58.049> it<00:02:58.109> out<00:02:58.230> hard

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
a face down if you throw it out hard

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.809 
a face down if you throw it out hard
enough<00:02:58.470> you'll<00:02:58.739> be<00:02:58.859> it<00:02:59.129> will<00:02:59.250> be<00:02:59.280> touching<00:02:59.700> the

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
enough space around the edge of the

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.250 
enough space around the edge of the
flash<00:03:12.390> where<00:03:12.569> it<00:03:12.660> doesn't<00:03:12.780> bounce<00:03:12.959> off<00:03:13.140> the

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
flash where it doesn't bounce off the

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.180 
flash where it doesn't bounce off the
edge<00:03:13.319> of<00:03:13.470> the<00:03:13.530> case<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:13.890> give<00:03:13.980> you<00:03:14.040> that<00:03:14.069> kind

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
lot of cases I've used before they were

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:29.750 
lot of cases I've used before they were
cheaper<00:03:28.709> they<00:03:28.829> were<00:03:28.889> like<00:03:29.099> busting<00:03:29.579> out<00:03:29.669> on
