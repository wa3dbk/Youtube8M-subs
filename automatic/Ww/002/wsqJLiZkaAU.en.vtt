unpackaged

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.010 
unpackaged
so<00:00:45.430> it's<00:00:45.610> pretty<00:00:45.760> flimsy<00:00:46.090> comes<00:00:46.540> off<00:00:46.750> like

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
so it's pretty flimsy comes off like

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
so it's pretty flimsy comes off like
this<00:00:47.680> but<00:00:47.950> once<00:00:48.820> I<00:00:48.910> put<00:00:48.940> the<00:00:49.270> 3s<00:00:49.870> in<00:00:50.710> there

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
this but once I put the 3s in there

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.760 
this but once I put the 3s in there
should<00:00:51.280> be<00:00:51.400> okay<00:00:51.730> so<00:00:52.620> this<00:00:53.620> is<00:00:54.720> so<00:00:55.720> it<00:00:56.410> has<00:00:56.560> all

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:56.770 
should be okay so this is so it has all

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.650 
should be okay so this is so it has all
the<00:00:56.890> grooves<00:00:57.130> cut<00:00:57.400> out<00:00:57.520> for<00:00:57.760> it<00:00:57.880> so<00:00:58.150> you<00:00:58.510> just

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
the grooves cut out for it so you just

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.550 
the grooves cut out for it so you just
fit<00:00:58.960> that<00:00:58.990> in<00:00:59.290> there<00:01:00.540> and<00:01:01.540> that<00:01:01.570> the<00:01:02.350> bottom

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:02.560
