00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
the cuff so today I'm gonna discuss the

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.960 
the cuff so today I'm gonna discuss the
made<00:00:27.300> in<00:00:27.630> labels<00:00:28.170> because<00:00:28.680> in<00:00:29.220> my<00:00:29.460> opinion

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
made in labels because in my opinion

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.380 
made in labels because in my opinion
they<00:00:30.330> really<00:00:31.230> don't<00:00:31.590> mean<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.040> whole<00:00:32.219> lot<00:00:32.430> so

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
they really don't mean a whole lot so

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.690 
they really don't mean a whole lot so
often<00:00:33.930> when<00:00:34.110> we<00:00:34.140> see<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.440> made<00:00:34.920> in<00:00:35.130> label<00:00:35.520> it

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
often when we see a made in label it

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.549 
often when we see a made in label it
will<00:00:35.850> make<00:00:36.000> us<00:00:36.149> feel<00:00:36.329> better<00:00:36.390> about<00:00:37.260> buying

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
will make us feel better about buying

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.069 
will make us feel better about buying
that<00:00:37.739> product<00:00:38.040> or<00:00:38.430> maybe<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.480> little<00:00:39.719> unsure

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
that product or maybe a little unsure

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.410 
that product or maybe a little unsure
about<00:00:40.350> buying<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:40.950> product<00:00:41.219> based<00:00:42.000> on<00:00:42.270> the

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
about buying that product based on the

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.139 
about buying that product based on the
different<00:00:42.870> opinions<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.250> things<00:00:44.700> we've<00:00:45.000> been

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
different opinions and things we've been

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.660 
different opinions and things we've been
told<00:00:45.420> about<00:00:45.890> manufacturing<00:00:46.890> in<00:00:47.219> different

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
told about manufacturing in different

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.920 
told about manufacturing in different
countries<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.710> lot<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.600> importance<00:00:51.600> I

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
countries that is a lot of importance I

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.470 
countries that is a lot of importance I
guess<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.500> place<00:00:52.770> on<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.340> little<00:00:53.640> label<00:00:54.030> when

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
guess to place on that little label when

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.330 
guess to place on that little label when
there<00:00:54.930> are<00:00:55.050> actually<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.469> lot<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.649> things<00:00:55.920> that

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
there are actually a lot of things that

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.060 
there are actually a lot of things that
that<00:00:56.370> label<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:57.000> not<00:00:57.360> telling<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.770> first

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
that label is not telling you so first

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.430 
that label is not telling you so first
of<00:00:59.219> all<00:00:59.250> this<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.730> going<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.149> be<00:01:00.300> a

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
of all this is going to be a

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.720 
of all this is going to be a
generalization<00:01:01.440> because<00:01:01.680> some<00:01:02.550> countries

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
generalization because some countries

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.119 
generalization because some countries
are<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.270> lot<00:01:03.660> better<00:01:03.930> than<00:01:04.049> others<00:01:04.650> when<00:01:05.040> it

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
are a lot better than others when it

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.850 
are a lot better than others when it
comes<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:06.119> labeling<00:01:06.479> requirements<00:01:06.860> but

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
comes to the labeling requirements but

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.850 
comes to the labeling requirements but
in<00:01:08.280> general<00:01:09.210> they<00:01:09.420> are<00:01:09.630> pretty<00:01:10.049> vague<00:01:10.409> and

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
in general they are pretty vague and

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.620 
in general they are pretty vague and
there<00:01:11.250> isn't<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.729> whole<00:01:11.939> lot<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.240> information

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
there isn't a whole lot of information

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.560 
there isn't a whole lot of information
that<00:01:13.500> companies<00:01:13.979> need<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.729> disclose<00:01:15.150> and

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
that companies need to disclose and

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.390 
that companies need to disclose and
there<00:01:15.750> isn't<00:01:16.140> generally<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.650> lot<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:16.979> follow<00:01:17.220> up

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
there isn't generally a lot of follow up

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.910 
there isn't generally a lot of follow up
to<00:01:17.610> make<00:01:17.759> sure<00:01:17.790> that<00:01:18.540> they<00:01:18.689> are<00:01:18.869> labeling<00:01:19.740> them

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
to make sure that they are labeling them

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.450 
to make sure that they are labeling them
properly<00:01:20.250> so<00:01:20.729> first<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.090> all<00:01:21.180> often<00:01:21.740> what<00:01:22.740> the

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
properly so first of all often what the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.359 
properly so first of all often what the
laws<00:01:23.790> are<00:01:23.820> regarding<00:01:24.689> those<00:01:24.869> made<00:01:25.409> in<00:01:25.439> tags<00:01:26.009> is

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
laws are regarding those made in tags is

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.300 
laws are regarding those made in tags is
that<00:01:26.479> it's<00:01:27.479> either<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.320> country<00:01:28.770> where<00:01:29.009> the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
that it's either the country where the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.130 
that it's either the country where the
most<00:01:29.610> amount<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.090> production<00:01:30.450> has<00:01:30.750> happened

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
most amount of production has happened

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.890 
most amount of production has happened
or<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:32.070> country<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.180> final<00:01:33.600> stage

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
or the country that is the final stage

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.950 
or the country that is the final stage
of<00:01:34.200> production<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.150> can<00:01:36.150> be<00:01:36.570> really

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
of production and that can be really

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.350 
of production and that can be really
misleading<00:01:37.500> because<00:01:37.650> for<00:01:38.640> example<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.240> could

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
misleading because for example you could

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.780 
misleading because for example you could
have<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.900> t-shirt<00:01:40.170> where<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.100> cotton<00:01:41.520> was

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
have a t-shirt where the cotton was

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.149 
have a t-shirt where the cotton was
grown<00:01:42.000> in<00:01:42.240> India<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:43.020> fabric<00:01:43.439> was<00:01:43.590> woven<00:01:44.040> in

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
grown in India the fabric was woven in

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.149 
grown in India the fabric was woven in
Bangladesh<00:01:44.700> dyed<00:01:45.450> in<00:01:45.659> China<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.380> maybe<00:01:46.619> sewn

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
Bangladesh dyed in China and maybe sewn

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.789 
Bangladesh dyed in China and maybe sewn
together<00:01:47.399> in<00:01:48.000> Italy<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.170> then<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.590> label

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
together in Italy and then the label

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.330 
together in Italy and then the label
would<00:01:50.100> say<00:01:50.369> made<00:01:51.119> in<00:01:51.450> Italy<00:01:51.960> even<00:01:52.350> though<00:01:52.920> that

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
would say made in Italy even though that

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.219 
would say made in Italy even though that
garment<00:01:53.610> has<00:01:54.240> been<00:01:54.479> through<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:55.079> many

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
garment has been through so many

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.080 
garment has been through so many
different<00:01:55.619> countries<00:01:55.799> Italy<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:56.939> great

example because they're usually
associated<00:01:59.939> with<00:02:00.090> quality<00:02:00.750> so<00:02:00.990> people<00:02:01.259> see

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
associated with quality so people see

made in Italy and they think it's really
good<00:02:03.270> quality<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:04.759> companies<00:02:05.759> obviously

of<00:02:28.800> companies<00:02:29.190> do<00:02:29.550> this<00:02:29.730> but<00:02:30.660> it<00:02:30.900> does<00:02:31.080> kind<00:02:31.349> of

of companies do this but it does kind of

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.550 
of companies do this but it does kind of
show<00:02:31.620> you<00:02:31.680> how<00:02:32.000> that<00:02:33.000> made<00:02:33.569> and<00:02:33.780> label<00:02:34.080> can<00:02:34.379> be

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
show you how that made and label can be

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.100 
show you how that made and label can be
misleading<00:02:35.129> now<00:02:35.910> this<00:02:36.239> is<00:02:36.390> not<00:02:36.569> at<00:02:36.750> all<00:02:36.840> meant

I<00:02:43.200> think<00:02:43.470> it's<00:02:43.590> really<00:02:43.860> awesome<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:44.550> support

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
I think it's really awesome to support

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.030 
I think it's really awesome to support
locally<00:02:45.480> made<00:02:45.629> products<00:02:46.110> but<00:02:46.680> it<00:02:46.890> is

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
locally made products but it is

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.940 
locally made products but it is
important<00:02:47.610> to<00:02:47.940> look<00:02:48.390> beyond<00:02:48.930> just<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.590> labels

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
important to look beyond just the labels

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.040 
important to look beyond just the labels
and<00:02:50.220> do<00:02:50.580> a<00:02:50.610> little<00:02:50.940> bit<00:02:51.060> of<00:02:51.269> research<00:02:51.780> about

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
and do a little bit of research about

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.050 
and do a little bit of research about
those<00:02:52.440> companies<00:02:52.890> now<00:02:53.550> in<00:02:53.580> my<00:02:53.970> experience

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
those companies now in my experience

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.050 
those companies now in my experience
when<00:02:54.480> it<00:02:54.569> comes<00:02:54.810> to<00:02:55.140> researching<00:02:55.680> companies

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
when it comes to researching companies

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.250 
when it comes to researching companies

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
kind of rule is that if a company is

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.790 
kind of rule is that if a company is
very<00:03:12.239> open<00:03:12.659> and<00:03:12.870> honest<00:03:13.319> and<00:03:13.560> transparent

very open and honest and transparent
about<00:03:14.459> their<00:03:14.640> manufacturing<00:03:15.269> they're

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
about their manufacturing they're

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.380 
about their manufacturing they're
probably<00:03:16.080> doing<00:03:16.470> pretty<00:03:16.620> good<00:03:16.980> things<00:03:17.250> and<00:03:17.610> if

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
probably doing pretty good things and if

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.690 
probably doing pretty good things and if
they<00:03:18.599> seem<00:03:18.930> like<00:03:18.959> they're<00:03:19.620> just<00:03:20.280> being<00:03:20.489> kind

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
they seem like they're just being kind

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.149 
they seem like they're just being kind
of<00:03:20.849> vague<00:03:21.150> and<00:03:21.690> not<00:03:22.050> really<00:03:22.319> giving<00:03:22.680> you<00:03:22.890> the

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:23.159 
of vague and not really giving you the

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:26.059 
of vague and not really giving you the
information<00:03:23.459> you<00:03:23.849> want<00:03:23.989> they<00:03:24.989> probably<00:03:25.500> don't

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
information you want they probably don't

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:27.979 
information you want they probably don't
really<00:03:26.340> know<00:03:26.670> or<00:03:27.030> don't<00:03:27.299> want<00:03:27.420> to<00:03:27.540> tell<00:03:27.750> you

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
really know or don't want to tell you

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.920 
really know or don't want to tell you
and<00:03:28.290> that's<00:03:28.769> a<00:03:28.920> really<00:03:29.099> bad<00:03:29.220> sign<00:03:29.280> also<00:03:30.120> when

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
and that's a really bad sign also when

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.809 
and that's a really bad sign also when
it<00:03:31.019> comes<00:03:31.049> to<00:03:31.409> shopping<00:03:31.590> locally<00:03:32.370> I<00:03:32.400> think

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
it comes to shopping locally I think

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.420 
it comes to shopping locally I think
supporting<00:03:33.420> small<00:03:34.140> businesses<00:03:34.860> is<00:03:35.129> really

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
supporting small businesses is really

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.280 
supporting small businesses is really
important<00:03:35.909> because<00:03:36.090> not<00:03:36.690> only<00:03:36.720> does<00:03:37.230> the

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
important because not only does the

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.890 
important because not only does the
money<00:03:37.530> go<00:03:37.830> directly<00:03:38.430> into<00:03:38.819> your<00:03:39.390> community

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
money go directly into your community

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.770 
money go directly into your community
but<00:03:40.319> they<00:03:40.590> often<00:03:40.980> know<00:03:41.280> a<00:03:41.310> lot<00:03:41.879> about<00:03:42.120> their

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
but they often know a lot about their

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.630 
but they often know a lot about their
manufacturing<00:03:43.530> their<00:03:43.769> factories<00:03:44.250> there<00:03:44.580> are

manufacturing their factories there are
small<00:03:44.849> business<00:03:45.180> they<00:03:45.330> work<00:03:45.510> a<00:03:45.750> lot<00:03:45.930> closer

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
small business they work a lot closer

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.130 
small business they work a lot closer
with<00:03:46.379> their<00:03:46.860> suppliers<00:03:47.310> and<00:03:47.700> manufacturers

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
with their suppliers and manufacturers

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.600

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
small companies are a lot better for

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.309 
small companies are a lot better for
that<00:03:58.920> in<00:03:59.220> general<00:03:59.599> so<00:04:00.599> now<00:04:00.750> in<00:04:00.930> regards<00:04:01.260> to

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
that in general so now in regards to

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.140 
that in general so now in regards to
clothing<00:04:01.769> that<00:04:01.920> is<00:04:01.980> made<00:04:02.340> in<00:04:02.459> places<00:04:02.909> that<00:04:02.939> I

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
clothing that is made in places that I

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.179 
clothing that is made in places that I
guess<00:04:03.450> are<00:04:03.629> more<00:04:03.810> known<00:04:04.049> for<00:04:04.080> sweatshops<00:04:04.890> I

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:05.189 
guess are more known for sweatshops I

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:07.910 
guess are more known for sweatshops I
think<00:04:06.120> often<00:04:06.780> there<00:04:07.049> is<00:04:07.290> this<00:04:07.620> knee-jerk

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
think often there is this knee-jerk

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.260 
think often there is this knee-jerk
reaction<00:04:08.700> when<00:04:08.879> things

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
reaction when things

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.440 
reaction when things
the<00:04:09.450> Rena<00:04:09.630> Plaza<00:04:09.960> collapse<00:04:10.350> happens<00:04:10.830> to<00:04:11.550> say

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
the Rena Plaza collapse happens to say

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.270 
the Rena Plaza collapse happens to say

Bangladesh and in my opinion that is not

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.840 
Bangladesh and in my opinion that is not
at<00:04:17.700> all<00:04:17.910> a<00:04:17.970> good<00:04:18.650> solution<00:04:19.650> if<00:04:20.370> you<00:04:20.550> want<00:04:20.760> to

those companies because those companies

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.890 
those companies because those companies

that if people knew more about it

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.130 
that if people knew more about it
then<00:05:20.070> they<00:05:20.340> wouldn't<00:05:20.730> want<00:05:21.420> to<00:05:21.510> buy<00:05:21.660> it<00:05:21.720> and

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.750 
look for and what to search for so if
you<00:05:42.510> have<00:05:42.660> any<00:05:42.810> questions<00:05:43.760> specifically

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760 
you have any questions specifically

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.940 
you have any questions specifically
around<00:05:45.300> that<00:05:45.570> definitely<00:05:46.410> let<00:05:46.590> me<00:05:46.620> know<00:05:46.740> in

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:46.950 
around that definitely let me know in

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.310 
around that definitely let me know in
the<00:05:46.980> comments<00:05:47.550> so<00:05:48.240> basically<00:05:48.630> to<00:05:48.870> kind<00:05:48.960> of<00:05:49.080> sum

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
the comments so basically to kind of sum

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.290 
the comments so basically to kind of sum
it<00:05:49.410> up<00:05:49.500> I<00:05:49.740> think<00:05:49.800> that<00:05:50.190> that<00:05:50.370> made<00:05:50.730> in<00:05:50.880> label

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
it up I think that that made in label

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.870 
it up I think that that made in label
means<00:05:51.540> very<00:05:52.080> little<00:05:52.380> and<00:05:52.770> it's<00:05:53.550> really

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
means very little and it's really

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.909 
means very little and it's really
important<00:05:54.419> to<00:05:54.540> look<00:05:54.690> beyond<00:05:55.080> that<00:05:55.260> and<00:05:55.650> look

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 
important to look beyond that and look

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:58.280 
important to look beyond that and look
into<00:05:56.220> the<00:05:56.760> companies<00:05:57.240> so<00:05:57.690> that<00:05:57.840> you<00:05:57.930> can<00:05:58.110> get<00:05:58.260> a

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:58.290 
into the companies so that you can get a

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.170 
into the companies so that you can get a
good<00:05:58.470> sense<00:05:58.740> if<00:05:59.010> they<00:05:59.220> are<00:05:59.310> being<00:05:59.580> honest<00:06:00.000> and

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
good sense if they are being honest and

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.230 
good sense if they are being honest and
transparent<00:06:00.419> and<00:06:01.110> genuine<00:06:02.040> don't<00:06:02.820> be<00:06:02.940> afraid

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
transparent and genuine don't be afraid

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.210 
transparent and genuine don't be afraid
