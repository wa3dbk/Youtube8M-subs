00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
week I got twins Lindsey popped out

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.180 
week I got twins Lindsey popped out
twins<00:02:07.000> of<00:02:07.420> the<00:02:07.719> Cheyenne<00:02:07.990> define<00:02:08.380> I<00:02:08.590> guess<00:02:09.009> if

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
twins of the Cheyenne define I guess if

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.150 
twins of the Cheyenne define I guess if
you<00:02:09.280> order<00:02:09.580> the<00:02:09.700> largest<00:02:10.149> size<00:02:10.620> you<00:02:11.620> get<00:02:11.769> to

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
you order the largest size you get to

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.000 
you order the largest size you get to
you<00:02:12.880> get<00:02:13.060> 2<00:02:13.330> which<00:02:13.540> equals<00:02:13.720> the<00:02:14.380> ounces<00:02:14.800> that

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
you get 2 which equals the ounces that

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.650 
you get 2 which equals the ounces that
they<00:02:15.160> say<00:02:15.700> that<00:02:15.940> you<00:02:16.060> are<00:02:16.090> getting<00:02:16.300> for<00:02:16.599> the

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
they say that you are getting for the

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.070 
they say that you are getting for the
price<00:02:16.690> i<00:02:17.200> think<00:02:17.290> this<00:02:18.040> was<00:02:18.400> like<00:02:19.209> anywhere

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
price i think this was like anywhere

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.130 
price i think this was like anywhere
between<00:02:20.200> eleven<00:02:21.330> eleven<00:02:22.330> dollars<00:02:22.510> maybe<00:02:22.989> I

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
between eleven eleven dollars maybe I

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.770 
between eleven eleven dollars maybe I
think<00:02:23.470> for<00:02:23.680> this<00:02:23.769> ounces<00:02:24.370> one<00:02:25.000> thing<00:02:25.209> one<00:02:25.420> does

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
think for this ounces one thing one does

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.300 
think for this ounces one thing one does
not<00:02:25.930> have<00:02:26.170> on<00:02:26.349> their<00:02:26.470> packaging<00:02:26.950> that<00:02:26.980> wish

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
not have on their packaging that wish

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.460 
not have on their packaging that wish
they<00:02:27.459> did<00:02:27.700> was<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.180> ounces<00:02:28.690> class<00:02:28.930> because

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
they did was the ounces class because

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.040 
they did was the ounces class because
