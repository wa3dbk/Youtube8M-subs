00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:12.530
 well the truth has always been very 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.780
 talented for almost all sports 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.189
 Well, I always tell you that it was good 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.830
 for many things and I always lacked 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:24.640
 perseverance 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.740
 like I never put 100% to anything if 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.020
 before sport for example I'm going to 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.650
 tell something a little funny played the 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.770
 flute myself and it was very good and I do not think that 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.990
 my grandmother 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.640
 I bought myself the best flute in that 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:44.600
 days ago 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:46.580
 he was considered a very talented boy and 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.740
 suddenly one day I got bored and never again 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:52.030
 I never went to class obviously my 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:55.450
 Grandma does not speak like six months 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.579
 and then I started playing soccer 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.980
 It was very good 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:03.860
 then to play in a team first 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.220
 I think that having been at 89 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.560
 years 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.530
 well my apá obviously argentino 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.320
 fanatic my grandfather was doctor de vélez 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.760
 sarfield in his time the Argentines 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.950
 obviously already 10 years old 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.810
 my father receives a job that he has to 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.520
 go to chile for four years 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.070
 I remember that at that time the 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.960
 team coach 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.479
 At one point he asked my parents to 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.130
 I'll stay in Israel because I'm going to 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.860
 lose everything I 've built up 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.410
 that moment in the lower and 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.600
 obviously they would never have left in 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:45.930
 israel and I went to chile 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.670
 In Chile, I played in the team of the 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.060
 Jewish community at the bottom of the maccabi 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.610
 which played a league or a league is 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.730
 between stadiums for example I think that in 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.880
 the argentina the similar 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.970
 but I never went professional in Chile 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.700
 Although it was very good 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.430
 and after four years I returned to Israel 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.640
 it was just a little bit too late to go back 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.460
 to start something professional in between 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.780
 chile I put on war tennis and it was also 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:18.370
 very good or I remember that the 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.070
 Age between 2 and 14 years old was 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.170
 ranked 20 for example was very good and 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.250
 I was not bored at one point and he came back 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.860
 to football 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.440
 and nothing like that in the end never take advantage 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.300
 my talent never obviously went back to 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.610
 israel returned to play in a team where 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.990
 I lived that it was near Jerusalem but 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.480
 it was a smaller team of second 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:43.240
 and in that moment when you enter that 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.180
 team the pass is theirs and I in a 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.890
 I wanted to play my team again 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.860
 original and they did not let me not give me the 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.380
 pass the pass was theirs or anything like 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.610
 I commented on several occasions later I had 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.720
 to make the decision whether to do the 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.160
 army like that is doing well in the 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.620
 fund tries to get me out so I can 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.640
 keep playing and I made the decision to 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.110
 make the army three years full 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.770
 trying to go to the best unit that 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:14.050
 could and so at the end the experience 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.120
 in the army I had millions of 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.860
 I had experiences I had to be in the 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:23.490
 lebanon four months making ambushes 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:26.460
 in general it was very hard but I did not 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:29.070
 I regret nothing I think that makes you grow 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:33.020
 in many ways that nowhere 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.020
 of the world comes to pass 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.920
 the brotherhood that is generated in the 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.900
 army with your friend is you can not 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.549
 compare with nothing 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.030
 and I am very proud of what I achieved 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.030
 do there 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.270
 I was also a paramedic or in a 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.390
 moment they took me to a course I made a 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.970
 course that is very hard and is very intense and 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.569
 short so you have to get to 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.569
 to learn to do 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.269
 and nothing I'm very nervous what I did 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:05.439
 it was an incredible experience and if 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.310
 I had to do it again I would 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:10.370
 something 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.020
 I think it gives you a lot of strength in 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.060
 many things 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.090
 there are many little things that come to me 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:21.350
 bone worry as I feel much 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:24.710
 stronger than average mentally 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.360
 same in poker at the end one many 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.040
 Sometimes I feel that I am weak 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.160
 mentally equal 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.950
 I do not manage not to tilt all the 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.550
 times that I would like 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:41.050
 but I think it's much more influential in 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.700
 the in life not in poker 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.220
 I think that 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:49.900
 there are very few things that can get me out 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:52.550
 crazy in the difficulties of life 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.120
 With everything that I managed to achieve I managed 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.880
 pass the requirement 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.320
 after the accident that I had in the 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.960
 army that I lost I see them 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.500
 I had a time that was the same very 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.500
 depressed 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:11.730
 and at that time, at 22 , I was a 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.830
 at that time they opened for the first time 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:17.449
 time in israel a casino 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:20.240
 Well , I come from 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:22.370
 of genes from my apá liked to play my 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.360
 Grandpa is also like he had it 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.909
 forever 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.600
 in my house we play roulette always 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:30.510
 they play cards 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:35.440
 Y 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:37.260
 I fell into the strong game at 22 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.529
 Y 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.569
 I lost a lot of talk 

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:43.729
 I travel to the USA in the background as to 

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:45.919
 escape a little bit of that and in the background 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:49.399
 I had to work to return many 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:51.409
 debts it took me almost five years in 

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:54.769
 to do that 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:56.959
 and I feel that in the USA in a moment 

00:05:54.769 --> 00:05:59.360
 when I already paid my debts 

00:05:56.959 --> 00:06:02.360
 I'm going to live in Miami 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:05.300
 and I know poker and I feel poker 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:08.539
 He gave me all the adrenaline that the 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.219
 game but with the difference that no longer 

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:13.520
 game against the house that is something that is 

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:17.199
 impossible to beat and it is a game 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.199
 more with the strategy more with 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:23.170
 with many other aspects that you 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:25.780
 gives the poker that I feel they give me a 

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:27.460
 advantage over others obviously at 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.340
 principle was not so good I had to go 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:32.960
 perfecting it I think a little bit of 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:35.270
 talent I have for this 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.240
 and I feel that power like that saved me 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:40.509
 of gambling addiction 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:43.300
 today no longer play as much as previously 

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:46.750
 I need it , poker gives me all those 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:49.740
 emotions and I managed to transform it into my 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:52.210
 profession today and today I can say 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:55.090
 proudly I have almost four 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:57.599
 years living from this and I consider that I 

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.599
 it's going pretty good
