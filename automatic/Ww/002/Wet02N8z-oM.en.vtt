little scary assistant this is a machine

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:02.349 
little scary assistant this is a machine
from<00:02:00.770> tria<00:02:01.100> they<00:02:01.399> actually<00:02:01.880> developed<00:02:02.270> an

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:02.359 
from tria they actually developed an

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:04.539 
from tria they actually developed an
at-home<00:02:02.539> laser<00:02:03.020> hair<00:02:03.289> removal<00:02:03.409> that's<00:02:04.130> not<00:02:04.369> as

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
at-home laser hair removal that's not as

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:05.830 
at-home laser hair removal that's not as
powerful<00:02:04.999> as<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.149> ones<00:02:05.329> they<00:02:05.509> use<00:02:05.689> in<00:02:05.780> the

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
powerful as the ones they use in the

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.690 
powerful as the ones they use in the
dermatologists<00:02:06.560> office<00:02:06.649> and<00:02:07.070> so<00:02:07.249> it<00:02:07.399> takes<00:02:07.609> a

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
dermatologists office and so it takes a

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.370 
dermatologists office and so it takes a
little<00:02:07.819> longer<00:02:07.999> to<00:02:08.240> use<00:02:08.450> okay<00:02:08.810> it's<00:02:09.020> a<00:02:09.110> little

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
little longer to use okay it's a little

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.200 
little longer to use okay it's a little
slower<00:02:09.679> it<00:02:10.009> says<00:02:10.429> it's<00:02:10.610> not<00:02:10.700> quite<00:02:11.060> as

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
slower it says it's not quite as

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:12.940 
slower it says it's not quite as
powerfully<00:02:11.690> effective<00:02:12.140> but<00:02:12.350> it's<00:02:12.470> a<00:02:12.590> it's<00:02:12.740> a

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
powerfully effective but it's a it's a

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.500 
powerfully effective but it's a it's a
really<00:02:13.280> good<00:02:13.430> alternative<00:02:13.520> and<00:02:14.090> you<00:02:14.150> can<00:02:14.300> use

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
really good alternative and you can use

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.840 
really good alternative and you can use
it<00:02:14.720> once<00:02:15.140> a<00:02:15.380> once<00:02:15.650> over<00:02:15.860> two<00:02:16.130> weeks<00:02:16.340> for<00:02:16.640> a<00:02:16.670> few

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
it once a once over two weeks for a few

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.400 
it once a once over two weeks for a few
months<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:17.300> then<00:02:17.420> go<00:02:17.540> back<00:02:17.720> over<00:02:17.930> it<00:02:18.110> as<00:02:18.230> your

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
months and then go back over it as your

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.470 
months and then go back over it as your
hair<00:02:18.620> grows<00:02:18.920> and<00:02:19.160> you<00:02:19.250> can<00:02:19.430> eventually<00:02:20.060> reach

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
hair grows and you can eventually reach

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.810 
hair grows and you can eventually reach
a<00:02:20.600> point<00:02:20.630> where<00:02:21.050> it<00:02:21.290> kills<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:22.010> hair<00:02:22.310> follicle

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
a point where it kills the hair follicle

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.280 
a point where it kills the hair follicle
and<00:02:22.910> you<00:02:23.030> don't<00:02:23.270> have<00:02:23.420> any<00:02:23.570> more<00:02:23.720> hair<00:02:23.900> so<00:02:24.140> this

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
and you don't have any more hair so this

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.309 
and you don't have any more hair so this
is<00:02:24.410> great<00:02:24.620> and<00:02:24.800> I<00:02:25.130> think

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
is great and I think

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.509 
is great and I think
it's<00:02:25.379> gonna<00:02:25.499> get<00:02:25.650> better<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.129> better<00:02:26.189> as<00:02:26.400> we

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
it's gonna get better and better as we

it's gonna get better and better as we
go<00:02:26.609> along<00:02:26.760> it<00:02:26.969> is<00:02:26.999> I<00:02:27.180> hope<00:02:27.269> it<00:02:27.420> comes<00:02:27.480> with<00:02:27.689> good

so<00:02:37.049> we<00:02:37.109> Howard<00:02:37.650> by<00:02:37.799> light<00:02:38.069> they're<00:02:38.639> powered

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:38.999 
so we Howard by light they're powered

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:40.459 
so we Howard by light they're powered
they<00:02:39.120> have<00:02:39.209> a<00:02:39.269> solar<00:02:39.540> panel<00:02:39.780> on<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.049> bottom

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:40.469 
they have a solar panel on the bottom

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:41.959 
they have a solar panel on the bottom
and<00:02:40.650> that<00:02:40.889> when<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:41.519> put<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:41.760> underwater

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:41.969 
and that when you put it underwater

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:45.190 
and that when you put it underwater
these<00:02:42.569> ions<00:02:43.109> are<00:02:43.379> activated<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:44.250> it<00:02:44.579> actually

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
these ions are activated and it actually

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.849 
these ions are activated and it actually
kills<00:02:46.200> bacteria

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:46.859 
kills bacteria

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:48.709 
kills bacteria
it's<00:02:47.099> dissolves<00:02:47.670> plaque<00:02:47.939> and<00:02:48.239> it<00:02:48.329> works<00:02:48.510> as<00:02:48.689> a

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:48.719 
it's dissolves plaque and it works as a

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:50.030 
it's dissolves plaque and it works as a
regular<00:02:48.900> brush<00:02:49.319> but<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:49.560> don't<00:02:49.859> need

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
regular brush but you don't need

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.619 
regular brush but you don't need
toothpaste<00:02:50.400> so<00:02:50.579> it's<00:02:50.700> great<00:02:50.909> for<00:02:50.939> travel<00:02:51.480> and

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
toothpaste so it's great for travel and

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.809 
toothpaste so it's great for travel and
so<00:02:51.900> it's<00:02:52.349> a<00:02:52.469> light<00:02:52.650> that<00:02:52.680> removes<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.609> plaque

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
so it's a light that removes the plaque

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.819 
so it's a light that removes the plaque
but<00:02:54.090> you<00:02:54.209> still<00:02:54.450> get<00:02:54.569> that<00:02:54.749> people<00:02:55.349> want<00:02:55.650> that

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
but you still get that people want that

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.800 
but you still get that people want that
manual<00:02:56.219> billing<00:02:56.609> does<00:02:56.760> it<00:02:56.909> have<00:02:57.090> that<00:02:57.359> well<00:02:57.750> it

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
manual billing does it have that well it

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.179 
manual billing does it have that well it
doesn't<00:02:57.989> have<00:02:58.139> that<00:02:58.260> it's<00:02:58.620> not<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:58.919> same<00:02:59.159> I

00:02:59.179 --> 00:02:59.189 
doesn't have that it's not the same I

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:01.009 
doesn't have that it's not the same I
think<00:02:59.340> that<00:02:59.579> that<00:02:59.760> people<00:03:00.180> really<00:03:00.480> like<00:03:00.659> the
