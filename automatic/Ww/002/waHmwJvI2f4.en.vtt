00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.820
 speaks personal beauty playing here with 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.640
 One more video and this time I wanted to 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:18.250
 bring you a novelty and also 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.740
 I wanted to hear your opinion on this. 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.750
 that I brought this video in this way 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.640
 is a very different thing for the channel 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.520
 so I'm going to ask you to use 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.880
 well the comments to tell me if 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.370
 really the picture is good 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.890
 if you enjoyed it if you can hear 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.780
 some defect because I have been since yesterday 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.649
 as you well know who saw the video 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.289
 previous 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:43.899
 You know I bought the media game. 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:47.800
 caption hd that capture card 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:50.379
 which captures both xbox 360 and ps3 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.449
 as i are the three consoles i 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:56.050
 I'm good at what's going on gameplay 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:58.899
 in the background is a sonic generations so from there 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.719
 was captured from Xbox 360 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.730
 I do not know if it has its dynamics of ps3 is 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:06.580
 so I do not know I'm being too 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.590
 redundant but it is the following personal 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.490
 It was the best image I could get. 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.650
 capture is from xbox 360 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.810
 I tested other games too. 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.300
 this way and I decided to bring a 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.340
 Sonic a slightly quieter game the 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.350
 I play a little more adventure because it's a 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.120
 thing that almost never brought the channel 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.690
 anyway I think I never brought it 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.520
 so what I asked for you, who can 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:33.190
 puts the video in 720p 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.990
 take a look okay I managed to capture 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.120
 A cool way, I did not find it difficult. 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.280
 move the HTA board does not care about the 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.340
 gameplay I always move Carlos 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.620
 I respect you too and I brought you 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.410
 truth two game place the first is from 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:50.620
 sonic generations and then a 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:53.170
 little brother 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.420
 planet pan in which they play a little 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.550
 not a serious step just for 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.450
 show the same image quality to 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.300
 you 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.970
 Good how I told you I already passed 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.730
 ian and indeed afternoon and all night 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.190
 to set up this card to bring 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.860
 for you as soon as possible these 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.620
 console game place and I felt 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.880
 difficult to set up for 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.030
 the ps3 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.620
 okay I do not know if the problem is the cable 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.510
 which is not very good for 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.940
 Capture the I 'm already providing 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.660
 buy the original sony that are the 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.670
 ps3 and xbox 360 component cables 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.660
 you can see there it looks like the image 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.660
 It's very good, right? 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:38.380
 of course i treated her in sony vegas 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.420
 Okay, I used enough color collector corbis 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:44.320
 It's good, I teach doing that in the channel. 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.850
 you just look for beauty is for who 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.890
 are thinking of buying a 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.950
 personal capture I can assure you 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.380
 was the best and was the best investment 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.540
 that I already did for the channel is fine 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:59.560
 cool, I really enjoyed doing gameplay 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:02.880
 It's the console's how you know I have it. 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.739
 many games see there games you want 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.140
 tell me in games that you like 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.320
 see what I 'm going to bring to you 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.239
 so far the big planet is sure to have been 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.600
 unanimous among you even because he is 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.520
 exclusive ps3 then few people play 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.110
 it is because it is a game that is not 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.130
 available for PC and no other 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.200
 console 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.440
 Good, I'll bring you, too, Mario. 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.170
 bros I quit a lot of people asked in the Wii, right? 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.390
 With you, I really like to cherish. 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.720
 for the image that's why I brought it 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.660
 You first that you see and to 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.550
 that you tell me whether you liked it or not 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.070
 Who are you going to watch anyway? 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.110
 You guys, what's going on in the background? 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.989
 as you can well see and read the big 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:49.270
 Planet, I thought the screen was all over 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.709
 Rain ladder at the time of gravitation 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.690
 TV staff 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.310
 Only now is the time to see the 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.500
 edition and everything else 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.290
 I thought it was cool, I thought 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.870
 It was not drizzled but if you think 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.019
 What's wrong is that you saw there. 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.989
 that I noticed made me say there and then 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:10.450
 and if you would like to see me bringing 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:12.850
 quite in fact not only that but 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.640
 of course what I brought and more 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.220
 in this plan 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.440
 is what the console would be and if you 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.900
 likes to see the big planet book there 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.700
 personal beauty then this video went to 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.850

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:28.790
 Capturing the media here for me. 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.919
 if you are, you do not know what games I have 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.810
 to ask I think in my video in 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.500
 I'll show you my little room here. 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.010
 games 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.660
 you can ask it is with an echo 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:42.530
 Especially he came to me yesterday. 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:45.350
 also the god of war collection good 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.760
 so if you like the image 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.400

 Do you want to help me promote the channel? 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.190
 That thing is pretty difficult on youtube. 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:00.290
 add the favorites so this is it 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.600
