00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:02.860
 this video is special 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.530
 in order to demonstrate 

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.919
 game download speed 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.919
 vampire 2 via web moesk 

00:00:11.739 --> 00:00:15.019
 I have a snow medic 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:17.730
 3 8 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.699
 there are not two discs here 1 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:20.650
 sit down 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.919
 another exact same idea 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:26.929
 in my opinion from the well 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:28.509
 so it will come out 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:31.509
 lawyer 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.040
 Now in the game section a disk format will appear 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.840
 we hear 2 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.120
 here we can 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.120
 let go 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.090
 but control he dumped again when 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.290
 start up 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.410
 stolen format 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.850
 this moment 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.150
 ps 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.920
 further download 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.620
 fao 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.020
 in it at number two 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.020
 run 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.260
 so here you can choose 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.380
 fell or arctic sea 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.070
 but for the sight saw 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.070
 our game 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.590
 mini carried Volgograd 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.390
 its this list of games 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.390
 appear 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.299
 I only have to punch 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.110
 retirement 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.010
 that's nothing that late work from 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.190
 all that is here 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.039
 how can i honestly 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.069
 from this time we consider 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:11.099
 how much 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.099
 before loading 

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:20.509
 on the stock exchange how would prepare the boot 

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:23.509
 mass of little release 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.239
 City Hall Officer 

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:43.279
 but this time he could compare 

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:44.799
 unified 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.419
 console 

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:48.079
 how much is there 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:49.589
 Irina Durnitsyna 

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:50.819
 right there 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.479
 but here's what if still loaded 

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:56.479
 traces of honor 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.989
 in second place will show next 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.059
 Well, these are the main games 

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:19.549
 unnecessary here 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.589
 even for a while 

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:24.589
 we are still in Lithuania 

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:30.119
 at the moment 

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:36.809
 document 

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:40.209
 to 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.299
 and his words are the moment 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.779
 shot rang out

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.379
 uah 

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:30.099
 presently 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:33.099
 calls 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.879
 such tough requirements 

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:39.879
 from 

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:47.400
 famous

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:15.699
 that's all 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:19.620
 now i want to say 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.710
 largely 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.710
 say who saw 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:26.029
 2 but in general he 

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:29.029
 to brake 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:33.039
 for example episode 1 

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:36.829
 just how do you see how long loading 

00:05:36.829 --> 00:05:39.289
 it is too 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:40.889
 I would like to 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:42.409
 fear 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:50.659
 square apparently another square in the territory itself was 

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:52.830
 cordoned off 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:06:01.330
