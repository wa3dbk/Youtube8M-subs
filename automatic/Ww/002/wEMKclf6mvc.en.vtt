that but it doesn't hold it it does have

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.139 
that but it doesn't hold it it does have
a<00:01:46.680> light<00:01:46.890> bulb<00:01:47.100> but<00:01:47.369> not<00:01:47.520> enough<00:01:47.759> for<00:01:47.790> me<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.060> be

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
a light bulb but not enough for me to be

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.700 
a light bulb but not enough for me to be
like<00:01:48.299> oh<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.869> know<00:01:49.079> what<00:01:49.290> this<00:01:49.409> is<00:01:49.560> going<00:01:49.649> to

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
like oh you know what this is going to

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.730 
like oh you know what this is going to
be<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.920> twist<00:01:50.280> out

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
be a twist out

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.679 
be a twist out
or<00:01:50.920> something<00:01:51.189> like<00:01:51.280> that<00:01:51.340> nothing<00:01:51.729> no<00:01:52.360> hold

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:52.689 
or something like that nothing no hold

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.770 
or something like that nothing no hold
like<00:01:52.990> that<00:01:53.229> as<00:01:54.070> far<00:01:54.460> as<00:01:54.490> protecting<00:01:54.909> against

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
like that as far as protecting against

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.740 
like that as far as protecting against
extreme<00:01:56.140> temperatures<00:01:56.710> I<00:01:56.950> can<00:01:57.430> see<00:01:57.729> that<00:01:58.119> it

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
extreme temperatures I can see that it

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.380 
extreme temperatures I can see that it
does<00:01:58.990> have<00:01:59.020> silicones<00:01:59.860> in<00:02:00.100> it<00:02:00.280> so<00:02:00.729> of<00:02:01.030> course

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
does have silicones in it so of course

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.170 
does have silicones in it so of course
it<00:02:01.659> would<00:02:01.869> prevent<00:02:02.380> my<00:02:02.590> hair<00:02:02.830> from<00:02:02.979> being<00:02:03.280> you

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
it would prevent my hair from being you

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.420 
it would prevent my hair from being you
know<00:02:04.299> damaged<00:02:04.659> by<00:02:04.840> heat<00:02:05.110> because<00:02:05.770> silicon<00:02:06.220> is

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
know damaged by heat because silicon is

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.999 
know damaged by heat because silicon is
a<00:02:06.490> protectant<00:02:07.210> birth<00:02:07.450> heat<00:02:07.899> now<00:02:08.259> the<00:02:08.319> texture

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
a protectant birth heat now the texture

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.790 
a protectant birth heat now the texture
is<00:02:09.039> really<00:02:09.550> really<00:02:09.849> silky<00:02:10.479> and<00:02:10.720> smooth<00:02:11.080> and<00:02:11.500> my

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.430

fingers<00:02:12.250> like<00:02:12.489> once<00:02:12.910> you<00:02:13.090> apply<00:02:13.360> it<00:02:13.480> onto<00:02:14.200> your

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
hair you can feel that it's going to

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.440
