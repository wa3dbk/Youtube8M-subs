very long video it's kind of short video

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.380 
very long video it's kind of short video
but<00:04:36.680> it's<00:04:36.860> pretty<00:04:37.400> awesome<00:04:37.520> in<00:04:37.970> my<00:04:38.000> opinion

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
but it's pretty awesome in my opinion

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.920 
but it's pretty awesome in my opinion
and<00:04:39.610> i'll<00:04:40.610> show<00:04:40.669> you<00:04:40.880> the<00:04:41.120> code<00:04:41.300> one<00:04:41.600> more<00:04:41.750> time

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
and i'll show you the code one more time

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.270 
and i'll show you the code one more time
so<00:04:42.320> it's<00:04:42.500> slush<00:04:43.190> give<00:04:44.120> and<00:04:44.450> then<00:04:45.410> space<00:04:45.830> your

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
so it's slush give and then space your

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.590 
so it's slush give and then space your
name<00:04:46.520> like<00:04:47.090> that<00:04:47.120> then<00:04:48.520> 397<00:04:49.520> space<00:04:49.850> one<00:04:50.180> space

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
name like that then 397 space one space

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.980 
name like that then 397 space one space
3<00:04:51.080> space<00:04:51.860> nipple<00:04:52.729> thing<00:04:52.910> and<00:04:53.450> then<00:04:53.570> i<00:04:53.750> guess

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
3 space nipple thing and then i guess

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.270 
3 space nipple thing and then i guess
you<00:04:54.110> could<00:04:54.229> just<00:04:54.380> do<00:04:54.560> that<00:04:54.710> and<00:04:54.919> press<00:04:55.100> the

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
you could just do that and press the

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.580 
you could just do that and press the
left<00:04:55.520> arrow<00:04:55.790> key<00:04:56.300> and<00:04:56.720> it<00:04:56.780> goes<00:04:56.960> inside<00:04:57.320> them

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
left arrow key and it goes inside them

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.070 
left arrow key and it goes inside them
so<00:04:57.710> you<00:04:57.800> can<00:04:57.890> type<00:04:58.100> and<00:04:58.340> then<00:04:58.940> scroll<00:04:59.479> capital

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
so you can type and then scroll capital

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.340 
so you can type and then scroll capital
s<00:05:00.290> owner<00:05:00.620> capital<00:05:01.370> earth<00:05:01.580> and<00:05:02.150> then<00:05:02.660> call<00:05:03.140> on

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
s owner capital earth and then call on
