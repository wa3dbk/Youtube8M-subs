00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
plastic bags in the future what makes

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.660 
plastic bags in the future what makes
these<00:01:15.540> bags<00:01:15.869> biodegradable<00:01:16.619> well<00:01:17.130> during<00:01:17.549> the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
these bags biodegradable well during the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.399 
these bags biodegradable well during the
manufacturing<00:01:18.240> process<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.930> aqua

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
manufacturing process and aqua

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.020 
manufacturing process and aqua
biodegradable<00:01:20.009> additive<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.610> used<00:01:20.850> the

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
biodegradable additive is used the

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.760 
biodegradable additive is used the
additive<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.600> blended<00:01:22.229> into<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.500> plastic

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
additive is blended into a plastic

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.039 
additive is blended into a plastic
during<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.759> extrusion<00:01:24.299> process<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:24.900> it's

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
during the extrusion process so it's

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.230 
during the extrusion process so it's
less<00:01:25.259> harmful<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.009> environment<00:01:26.210> not<00:01:27.210> only

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
less harmful to the environment not only

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.600 
less harmful to the environment not only
are<00:01:27.630> these<00:01:27.780> new<00:01:28.259> bags<00:01:28.500> biodegradable<00:01:29.280> but
