to answer the question where do frogs

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.439 
to answer the question where do frogs
live<00:00:16.410> well<00:00:17.369> there's<00:00:17.730> lots<00:00:17.910> of<00:00:18.119> different

frogs living all over the world in fact
they're<00:00:21.029> found<00:00:21.240> just<00:00:21.570> about<00:00:21.750> every<00:00:22.050> place

regions up north it's just too cold for
them<00:00:27.599> up<00:00:27.810> there<00:00:28.050> your<00:00:28.769> frogs<00:00:29.039> are<00:00:29.429> most

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
them up there your frogs are most

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.590 
them up there your frogs are most
diverse<00:00:30.330> around<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.380> tropical<00:00:31.800> rainforests

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:32.600 
diverse around the tropical rainforests

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.459 
diverse around the tropical rainforests
scientists<00:00:33.600> estimate<00:00:33.989> that<00:00:34.050> there's<00:00:34.320> about

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
scientists estimate that there's about

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.770 
scientists estimate that there's about
5,000<00:00:35.309> frogs<00:00:35.489> existing<00:00:36.059> today<00:00:36.210> one<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.719> the

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
5,000 frogs existing today one of the

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.510 
5,000 frogs existing today one of the
most<00:00:36.989> diverse<00:00:37.440> group<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.920> vertebrates<00:00:38.340> that

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
most diverse group of vertebrates that

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.510 
most diverse group of vertebrates that
there<00:00:38.760> are<00:00:39.350> frogs<00:00:40.350> are<00:00:40.649> cold<00:00:40.890> blooded<00:00:41.100> and

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
there are frogs are cold blooded and

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.830 
there are frogs are cold blooded and
what<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:41.940> means<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.360> their<00:00:42.660> body

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
what that means is that their body

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.690 
what that means is that their body
temperature<00:00:43.469> tends<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.920> fluctuate<00:00:44.160> with

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
temperature tends to fluctuate with

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.880 
temperature tends to fluctuate with
environmental<00:00:45.360> temperatures<00:00:45.870> so<00:00:46.500> they<00:00:46.620> can't

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
environmental temperatures so they can't

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.650 
environmental temperatures so they can't
really<00:00:47.039> stand<00:00:47.370> places<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:48.030> are<00:00:48.180> really

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
really stand places that are really

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.840 
really stand places that are really
really<00:00:48.930> cold<00:00:49.140> they<00:00:49.950> just<00:00:50.160> can't<00:00:50.370> keep<00:00:50.550> enough

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
really cold they just can't keep enough

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.060 
really cold they just can't keep enough
heat<00:00:51.059> it's<00:00:51.420> not<00:00:51.570> possible<00:00:52.050> for<00:00:52.230> them<00:00:52.379> so

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
heat it's not possible for them so

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.439 
heat it's not possible for them so
instead<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.610> tend<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.850> find<00:00:54.090> them<00:00:54.300> in

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
instead you tend to find them in

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.840 
instead you tend to find them in
temperate<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:54.989> tropical<00:00:55.100> areas<00:00:56.100> now<00:00:56.699> in

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
temperate and tropical areas now in

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.760 
temperate and tropical areas now in
temperate<00:00:57.239> areas<00:00:57.390> like<00:00:57.899> Maine<00:00:58.469> or

temperate areas like Maine or
Pennsylvania<00:00:59.219> where<00:00:59.730> it<00:00:59.820> can<00:00:59.969> get<00:01:00.059> pretty

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
Pennsylvania where it can get pretty

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.540 
Pennsylvania where it can get pretty
cold<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.780> even<00:01:01.050> snow<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.649> even<00:01:02.100> have<00:01:02.250> ponds

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
cold and even snow and even have ponds

freeze over in the winter

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.050 
freeze over in the winter
frogs<00:01:04.290> deal<00:01:04.530> with<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:04.830> by<00:01:04.979> hibernating<00:01:05.670> they

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
frogs deal with that by hibernating they

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.760 
frogs deal with that by hibernating they
bury<00:01:06.330> themselves<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.080> mud<00:01:07.290> their<00:01:07.590> body

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
processes slow down that's how they get

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.480 
processes slow down that's how they get
through<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.530> winter<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.100> then<00:01:11.250> when<00:01:11.369> the

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
spring comes and the water thaws out

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.399 
spring comes and the water thaws out
they'll<00:01:14.220> get<00:01:14.909> back<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.299> hopping<00:01:15.840> around<00:01:15.960> and

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
they'll get back to hopping around and

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.380 
they'll get back to hopping around and
start<00:01:16.680> producing<00:01:17.070> some<00:01:17.400> tadpoles<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.240> turn

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
start producing some tadpoles to turn

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.350 
start producing some tadpoles to turn
into<00:01:18.659> more<00:01:18.900> frogs<00:01:19.850> the<00:01:20.850> frogs<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:21.240> we're

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
into more frogs the frogs that we're

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.300 
into more frogs the frogs that we're
most<00:01:21.540> familiar<00:01:21.840> with<00:01:22.259> are<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.590> sort<00:01:23.220> of

most familiar with are the sort of
swimming<00:01:23.610> type<00:01:23.909> frogs<00:01:24.270> they're<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.630> ones

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
swimming type frogs they're the ones

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.450 
swimming type frogs they're the ones
that<00:01:24.900> you're<00:01:25.080> going<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.229> see<00:01:25.470> look<00:01:25.710> sitting<00:01:26.340> on

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
that you're going to see look sitting on

that you're going to see look sitting on
a<00:01:26.490> lily<00:01:26.729> pad<00:01:26.850> or<00:01:27.330> swimming<00:01:27.720> around<00:01:27.930> in<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.259> lake

a lily pad or swimming around in a lake

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.069 
a lily pad or swimming around in a lake
you<00:01:29.460> can<00:01:29.490> recognize<00:01:30.150> those<00:01:30.390> frogs<00:01:30.720> because

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
you can recognize those frogs because

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.780 
you can recognize those frogs because
they<00:01:31.290> have<00:01:31.439> webbing<00:01:31.829> between<00:01:31.920> their<00:01:32.280> toes<00:01:32.490> and

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
they have webbing between their toes and

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.600 
they have webbing between their toes and
they<00:01:33.689> might<00:01:33.869> have<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:34.110> small<00:01:34.470> claw<00:01:34.799> on<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.430> back

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
they might have a small claw on the back

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.390 
they might have a small claw on the back
feet<00:01:35.880> or<00:01:36.060> even<00:01:36.509> on<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.720> front<00:01:36.930> feet<00:01:37.140> also<00:01:38.009> if

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
feet or even on the front feet also if

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.679 
feet or even on the front feet also if
you<00:01:38.549> see<00:01:38.729> them<00:01:38.880> stretched<00:01:39.150> out<00:01:39.390> they're<00:01:39.570> going
