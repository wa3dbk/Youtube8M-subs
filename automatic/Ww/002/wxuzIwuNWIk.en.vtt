00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 Hello dear friends today with us 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:10.440
 on the plan a few words about how 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.820
 disassemble the radeon r9 290 graphics card and 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.849
 290x 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:19.010
 on reference design for this to us 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:21.590
 need a set of watch screwdrivers and 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:25.769
 graphics card that we will disassemble 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:31.619
 first you need to unscrew the two 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:37.020
 screws that connect the panel with 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:40.200
 output connectors with metal part 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.590
 cooling system cover these here 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.480
 two screws on top of screws near the connectors 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:51.030
 touch not worth it we did not 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:56.489
 will prevent further need to unscrew 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:01:01.710
 4 screws that hold 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:04.680
 cooling system around the chip itself 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.330
 cpu video card here 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:13.530
 they pay attention 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:16.979
 unscrew it is not immediately until the end but by 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.960
 slightly weakening the campaign against the hour 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.520
 arrows or clockwise from not 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.380
 the essence is important slightly loosen 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.840
 go to the next 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.939
 him too slightly weaken go to 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.400
 next and so in a circle gradually 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.970
 until you unscrew and all that is skewed 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:37.140
 we should not allow further unscrew all 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:41.810
 the screws on the back of the board are already there 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.810
 order is not important here all these screws 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.210
 after they are already marked 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.630
 nothing will hurt 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.939
 remove the cooling system from the video card 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.960
 pore after all the screws 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.829
 unscrewed you can gently try 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.350
 to separate 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.860
 skin cooling system from printed 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.110
 fees 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.720
 the main thing is not to apply too much 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:19.250
 forces because you can hurt 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.250
 fee neatly at the edges uncouple 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:33.600
 the casing is safely behind the board and 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.870
 can now be disabled 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.870
 fan 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:59.599
 that is not so easy everything turned out before 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.510
 we see this masterpiece of masters 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:08.769
 because of andy 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:15.980
 as many as 16 memory chips 512 bit bus 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:19.940
 quite powerful power system here 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:23.540
 such an interesting board thanks for 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.530
 viewing the next series we will 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.750
 to put 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.970
 arctic cooling twin turbo 2 this 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.930
 beautiful don't forget to subscribe to 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.930
 good luck channel
