other long shot bags this one's a little

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.980 
other long shot bags this one's a little
bit<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.380> thicker<00:01:10.590> material<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.600> it<00:01:12.600> comes<00:01:12.810> in

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
bit of thicker material and it comes in

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.620 
bit of thicker material and it comes in
black<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.680> believe<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.159> camel<00:01:14.760> color<00:01:14.970> the

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
black and I believe a camel color the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.840 
black and I believe a camel color the
one<00:01:15.720> I'm<00:01:15.840> using<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.350> short<00:01:17.040> strap<00:01:17.340> so

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
one I'm using is the short strap so

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.609 
one I'm using is the short strap so
notice<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.509> this<00:01:18.810> strap<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.259> little<00:01:19.530> bit

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
notice that this strap is a little bit

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.520 
notice that this strap is a little bit
shorter<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.400> materials<00:01:20.939> thicker<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.810> it's

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
shorter the materials thicker and it's

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.990 
shorter the materials thicker and it's
still<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:23.009> think<00:01:23.220> it's<00:01:23.580> still<00:01:23.729> kind<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:23.939> like

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
still I think it's still kind of like

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.030 
still I think it's still kind of like
water-resistant<00:01:24.840> or<00:01:25.200> whatnot<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.680> doesn't

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
water-resistant or whatnot it doesn't

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.280 
water-resistant or whatnot it doesn't
have<00:01:26.130> any<00:01:26.280> compartments<00:01:26.939> similar<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.810> my<00:01:27.960> last

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
to kind of carry it here and you don't

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.010 
to kind of carry it here and you don't
really<00:02:26.100> need<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.370> carry<00:02:26.610> too<00:02:26.850> much<00:02:27.060> like<00:02:27.630> as<00:02:27.900> in

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
really need to carry too much like as in

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.020 
really need to carry too much like as in
this<00:02:28.170> this<00:02:28.440> type<00:02:28.830> of<00:02:28.860> a<00:02:29.070> short<00:02:29.580> strap<00:02:29.820> is

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
this this type of a short strap is

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.770 
this this type of a short strap is
probably<00:02:30.660> best<00:02:30.900> for<00:02:31.110> not<00:02:31.940> like<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:33.209> not<00:02:33.540> fill

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
probably best for not like to not fill

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.880 
probably best for not like to not fill
your<00:02:33.959> bag<00:02:34.110> to<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.350> brim<00:02:34.590> when<00:02:34.770> you're

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
your bag to the brim when you're

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.560

carrying<00:02:35.100> it<00:02:35.340> with<00:02:35.489> this<00:02:35.970> type<00:02:36.180> of<00:02:36.209> shorter

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
carrying it with this type of shorter

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.690 
carrying it with this type of shorter
strap<00:02:36.840> but<00:02:37.500> I<00:02:37.530> do<00:02:37.650> think<00:02:37.980> that<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.280> look<00:02:38.459> is<00:02:38.610> a

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
strap but I do think that the look is a

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.340 
strap but I do think that the look is a
little<00:02:38.850> bit<00:02:38.940> more<00:02:39.090> delicate<00:02:39.300> sometimes<00:02:40.050> then

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
little bit more delicate sometimes then

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.220 
little bit more delicate sometimes then
the<00:02:40.590> long<00:02:40.800> strap<00:02:41.130> I<00:02:41.430> use<00:02:42.420> this<00:02:42.540> as<00:02:42.690> my<00:02:42.810> work<00:02:42.989> bag

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
the long strap I use this as my work bag

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.380 
the long strap I use this as my work bag
and<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:43.650> maybe<00:02:44.130> I'll<00:02:44.280> do<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.459> it's<00:02:44.970> the

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
and and maybe I'll do a it's the

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.370 
think that they're great investment
pieces<00:06:11.180> because<00:06:11.600> not<00:06:11.780> only<00:06:11.810> are<00:06:12.140> they<00:06:12.230> great

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550 
to use for a day-to-day and it's also

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:21.190

like this when you fold them up if

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.420 
like this when you fold them up if

you're if you're heading somewhere or

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.399 
you're if you're heading somewhere or
traveling<00:06:28.939> and<00:06:29.089> you<00:06:29.150> can<00:06:29.300> keep<00:06:29.870> a<00:06:29.960> spare<00:06:30.259> one

00:06:30.399 --> 00:06:30.409 
traveling and you can keep a spare one

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:33.309 
traveling and you can keep a spare one
with<00:06:30.620> you<00:06:30.999> also<00:06:31.999> when<00:06:32.479> you<00:06:32.569> think<00:06:32.779> about<00:06:32.839> the

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:33.319 
with you also when you think about the

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:35.829 
with you also when you think about the
longevity<00:06:33.710> of<00:06:34.129> it<00:06:34.759> both<00:06:34.939> the<00:06:35.180> style<00:06:35.479> being

00:06:35.829 --> 00:06:35.839 
longevity of it both the style being

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:37.179 
longevity of it both the style being
that<00:06:36.020> it's<00:06:36.139> really<00:06:36.349> classic<00:06:36.620> and<00:06:36.919> you<00:06:37.039> can

00:06:37.179 --> 00:06:37.189 
that it's really classic and you can

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:39.159 
that it's really classic and you can
wear<00:06:37.309> it<00:06:37.370> for<00:06:37.520> multiple<00:06:37.909> seasons<00:06:38.089> it's<00:06:38.930> also

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:39.169 
wear it for multiple seasons it's also

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:42.869 
wear it for multiple seasons it's also
really<00:06:39.620> practical<00:06:40.370> to<00:06:40.759> use<00:06:40.789> you<00:06:41.569> know<00:06:41.689> like

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:42.879 
really practical to use you know like

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:45.730 
really practical to use you know like
just<00:06:43.879> for<00:06:44.120> for<00:06:44.479> day-to-day<00:06:44.659> and<00:06:45.319> then<00:06:45.469> I<00:06:45.589> think

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:45.740 
just for for day-to-day and then I think

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.379 
just for for day-to-day and then I think
the<00:06:45.860> price<00:06:46.069> is<00:06:46.279> very<00:06:46.309> very<00:06:46.849> reasonable

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:47.389 
the price is very very reasonable

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:48.939 
the price is very very reasonable
because<00:06:47.539> a<00:06:47.749> lot<00:06:47.960> of<00:06:47.990> banks<00:06:48.379> even<00:06:48.499> from<00:06:48.740> lower

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:48.949 
because a lot of banks even from lower

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:52.719 
because a lot of banks even from lower
end<00:06:49.219> stores<00:06:50.080> aren't<00:06:51.080> as<00:06:51.289> durable<00:06:51.800> and<00:06:52.099> they

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:52.729 
end stores aren't as durable and they

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:55.540 
end stores aren't as durable and they
also<00:06:53.059> like<00:06:53.499> go<00:06:54.499> out<00:06:54.620> of<00:06:54.740> style<00:06:54.919> really<00:06:55.249> quickly

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:55.550 
also like go out of style really quickly

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:56.769 
also like go out of style really quickly
so<00:06:55.729> I<00:06:55.759> think<00:06:55.879> that<00:06:56.150> it's<00:06:56.300> it's<00:06:56.509> a<00:06:56.629> nice

00:06:56.769 --> 00:06:56.779 
so I think that it's it's a nice

00:06:56.779 --> 00:06:58.839 
so I think that it's it's a nice
investment<00:06:57.319> to<00:06:57.379> have<00:06:57.499> in<00:06:57.680> your<00:06:57.770> closet<00:06:57.979> or<00:06:58.399> or

00:06:58.839 --> 00:06:58.849 
investment to have in your closet or or

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:00.219 
investment to have in your closet or or
to<00:06:59.089> use<00:06:59.300> switch<00:06:59.599> back<00:06:59.779> and<00:06:59.809> forth<00:07:00.020> between

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:00.229 
to use switch back and forth between

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:02.589 
to use switch back and forth between
bags<00:07:00.710> and<00:07:00.979> whatnot<00:07:01.249> and<00:07:01.520> I<00:07:01.939> find<00:07:02.210> that<00:07:02.270> since

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:02.599 
bags and whatnot and I find that since

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:04.299 
bags and whatnot and I find that since
I've<00:07:02.749> used<00:07:02.990> these<00:07:03.169> long<00:07:03.379> jump<00:07:03.620> bags<00:07:03.830> I<00:07:04.039> have<00:07:04.279> a

00:07:04.299 --> 00:07:04.309 
I've used these long jump bags I have a

00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:05.589 
I've used these long jump bags I have a
hard<00:07:04.520> time<00:07:04.729> going<00:07:04.909> back<00:07:05.149> to<00:07:05.210> a<00:07:05.389> regular

00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:05.599 
hard time going back to a regular

00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:07.420 
hard time going back to a regular
leather<00:07:05.990> purse<00:07:06.319> simply<00:07:06.889> because<00:07:07.159> there's<00:07:07.309> so
