00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.610
 welcome you summoners today we 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.980
 explain the new rank system we 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.650
 consider the basics of promotion and selection 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.400
 Games in the new ranking system new 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.350
 rank system 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.140
 based on 5 bronze groups 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.510
 silver gold platinum diamond 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.800
 but now we have a new group 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.350
 challenger 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.439
 each group consists of several faces 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.630
 league and tall order is 250 players or 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.520
 teams of one group that is in each 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.670
 group may be many leagues for 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.010
 250 players further the league is divided into 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.660
 divisions each league contains five 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.120
 divisions of 50 players 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.590
 each group consists of many faces 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.870
 so theoretically 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.870
 the player may be in the gold group 8 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.469
 second division league rank system 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.239
 simply 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.370
 if you played at time before the start 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.710
 seasons then you get into league group and 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.850
 division according to your present el and 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.039
 max LA 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.870
 in case you didn't play before the start 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.850
 season you have to play 10 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.369
 placement of matches if played solo or 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.049
 five matches per team depending on 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.030
 the results of these matches you will 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.189
 placed in a certain league group and 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.900
 division by the results of these matches 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.909
 the player can only be placed in 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.799
 bronze silver or gold band 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.780
 where he will not begin his rise to 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.610
 top promotion higher and group 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.840
 occurs due to matches played and 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.909
 league points earned 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.250
 every time you win stock 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.310
 league points are replenished and vice versa when 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.810
 league points are deducted for each loss 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.670
 League points range from 0 to 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.740
 100 and displays your position in 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.810
 the division in which you are to 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.820
 example if you have 90 league points then you 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.520
 you are higher on the stairs than the one 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.500
 whom 60 league points and so on when you 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.220
 played enough games and scored 100 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.710
 league points 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.750
 you will start to play a series of battalion series 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.640
 Division are the three best matches that 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.159
 determine your transition next division 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.930
 it happens automatically to you not 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.670
 you need to activate it and you can not 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.180
 play this time ranked games out 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.670
 series 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.500
 although these three best matches can be 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.909
 played over a long time span and 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.880
 you don't have to play them for one 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.039
 sitting down 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.349
 you have four weeks to play 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.759
 battalion series after the end of the term you 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.950
 lose the right to increase 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.170
 other players cannot see you 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.060
 whether you are in the division series or not yourself 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.190
 decide to share this information or 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.110
 keep it with you if you hit 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.300
 first division of your group and you 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.730
 point in the league then you can play a series 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.190
 promotion is 5 games that decide 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.110
 will you go higher or not by 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.849
 Essentially this, too, that I am a series of division 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.640
 only last longer has another 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.620
 ultimate goal when losing for example 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.599
 two of the three matches of the division series or 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.549
 three of the five matches of the promotion series you 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.920
 lose some league points depending 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:44.620
 from the results of the series with this indicator 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.690
 will not fall below 60 points after 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.670
 refilling the scale you can 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.340
 again try your luck in the promotion series 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.930
 and of course having lunch a series of divisions or 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.880
 series of promotion will lift you up 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.010
 a step higher in the division or group 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.769
 accordingly after you advance 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.329
 start collecting league points from scratch if 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.250
 you lose the first match after 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:04.989
 advancement you will not return previous 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.599
 division or group as there is 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.489
 grace period this period gives you 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.049
 time for example five matches which 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.319
 you can lose without consequences 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:16.180
 so-called safe zone if 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.250
 you will continue to play matches after 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.560
 the end of the grace period will return you 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.569
 previous division fortunately it's not 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.700
 distributed to groups you can 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.799
 move up and down divisions 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.019
 but you will never lose earned 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.519
 group for example if you just switched 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.530
 into the silver group and lost 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.569
 next match then you will not 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.120
 dropped a bronze band riot and 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.769
 called this system promotion care 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.260
 since no one wants to lose their 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.940
 achievements because of losing so how 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.340
 only you entered the group all that you 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.069
 it remains to move up but 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.689
 there is an exception 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.099
 if you have not played the framework give more 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:52.739
 twenty eight days then you start 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:54.420
 lose league points every week if you 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.400
 lose all league points while doing 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.319
 being at the bottom of a group or division then 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.389
 you can go down in the division so 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.099
 and in the group since the earned group 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:03.870
 remains forever you must constantly 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.760
 show your skills in battle 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.500
 against players from the highest group in order 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.689
 get rights to a series of promotion 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.430
 the number of points earned league will be 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:13.500
 decrease as the series approaches 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.209
 promotion so you have to 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.070
 win a little more urine to 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.349
 earn the rights to the promotion series 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.720
 There are other ways to lose league points 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:23.789
 if you leave the line you will lose 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.979
 league night and get a minute ban on 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:28.259
 matchmaking repeated violations take off 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:30.870
 more league points and are punished by a ban of 30 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:33.330
 minutes the teams lose 10 league points but not 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.520
 get banned leaving the line during 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.919
 Division Series or Promotion Series 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.690
 lose the right to continue the series in 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.639
 In this case, you need to win more 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.830
 one game in order to regain its right 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.470
 on the series and now let's talk about the group 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.289
 challenger this group functions a little 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.180
 differently and has no divisions in this 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:53.669
 a group can have only 50 teams per 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.470
 all rome if challenger team 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.849
 loses by becoming diamond and 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.380
 accordingly, her place is 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:01.229
 a team from the diamond group 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.000
 This means that the top team from diamond 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:05.250
 groups must prove that they are stronger 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.860
 the weakest teams from challenger beating 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.659
 her for raising staying in a group 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.150
 challenger team not playing week 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:14.789
 inactive commands will become inactive 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.710
 always priority for lowering thrust 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:17.460
 To all challenger group there is no cap 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.380
 league points 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.389
 teams that constantly win 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.090
 earn league points and improve their 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:26.940
 position in the camps arise logical 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:29.699
 the question is where did ela ela go nowhere 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:32.250
 gone but she hidden the function of el 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:34.169
 used to note the command is 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.060
 does it mean that if you hang around to 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:37.740
 example of the gold group second division 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.539
 games will take place with teams from 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.550
 golden group occasionally meeting with 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:44.099
 teams from the higher and lower groups 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.930
 but if you actively play and match for 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:47.370
 match and find yourself at the bottom of the golden 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.380
 game groups are starting to pass 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.690
 a silver band even though 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.400
 that you yourself are in gold winning teams 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.810
 from downstream groups you will 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.120
 earn a small amount 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.930
 league points since your rating is much 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.389
 lower than he gave 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.400
 be the same mechanics works case 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:04.770
 if you raise the rating and your place 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.740
 in the division in this case your team 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.910
 will earn more league points 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.620
 so if you decide to cheat and 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.360
 sink to the bottom of your group so that 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.180
 play weaker teams then you 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.860
 just lose time and rating 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.509
 in this case, earning points league 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.490
 will be so low that you yourself 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:23.580
 understand how much time wasted and 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:25.199
 efforts and finally the last rewards 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.820
 rewards will depend on your 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:29.220
 positions in the league system 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.960
 they are from your ilo it means that if in 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:32.669
 the beginning of the season you took gold but not 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.520
 managed to rise above you anyway 

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:37.380
 get rewards for gold group here 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.530
 so does the ranking system in 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:42.330
