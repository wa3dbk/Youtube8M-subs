it a little bit on the table here to

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.529 
it a little bit on the table here to
make<00:02:05.040> sure<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.910> we<00:02:06.030> get<00:02:06.119> it<00:02:06.270> packed<00:02:06.630> in<00:02:07.380> there

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
make sure that we get it packed in there

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.540 
make sure that we get it packed in there
you<00:02:09.539> know<00:02:09.660> down<00:02:09.899> in<00:02:10.050> into<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.070> roots<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.459> want

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
you know down in into the roots you want

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.290 
you know down in into the roots you want
to<00:02:11.670> make<00:02:11.790> sure<00:02:12.030> that<00:02:12.300> there's<00:02:13.820> media<00:02:14.820> in

to make sure that there's media in
between<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.200> roots<00:02:16.440> looks<00:02:17.310> like<00:02:17.459> we<00:02:17.550> need<00:02:17.700> a

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
between the roots looks like we need a

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.550 
between the roots looks like we need a
little<00:02:18.269> bit<00:02:18.420> more<00:02:18.780> in<00:02:19.170> there

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
little bit more in there

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.530 
little bit more in there

he's pushing down some of those larger
pieces<00:02:23.080> now<00:02:23.790> realize<00:02:24.790> we're<00:02:25.030> using<00:02:25.240> a<00:02:25.480> larger

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
pieces now realize we're using a larger

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
bark mix you can kind of get a look at

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.199 
bark mix you can kind of get a look at

we're<00:02:47.110> using<00:02:47.260> this<00:02:47.470> larger<00:02:47.950> bark

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
we're using this larger bark

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.610 
we're using this larger bark
we've<00:02:49.000> had<00:02:49.120> this<00:02:49.270> bark<00:02:49.510> soaking<00:02:50.050> for<00:02:50.350> a<00:02:50.380> few

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
we've had this bark soaking for a few

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.920 
we've had this bark soaking for a few
days<00:02:50.860> and<00:02:51.520> we<00:02:51.940> were<00:02:52.060> only<00:02:52.180> using<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.720> bark

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
days and we were only using the bark

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.729 
days and we were only using the bark
that's<00:02:53.140> floating<00:02:53.709> in<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.130> top<00:02:54.370> of<00:02:54.550> the<00:02:54.610> medium

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
that's floating in the top of the medium

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.810 
that's floating in the top of the medium
because<00:02:56.739> anything<00:02:57.010> that<00:02:57.190> sinks<00:02:57.640> to<00:02:57.760> the

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
because anything that sinks to the

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.140 
because anything that sinks to the
bottom<00:02:57.880> you<00:02:58.720> know<00:02:58.810> is<00:02:58.959> right<00:02:59.200> so<00:03:00.090> it<00:03:01.090> looks

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
bottom you know is right so it looks

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.860 
bottom you know is right so it looks
pretty<00:03:01.540> good<00:03:01.720> okay<00:03:02.730> at<00:03:03.730> this<00:03:03.910> point<00:03:04.209> it<00:03:04.660> looks

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
pretty good okay at this point it looks

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.800 
pretty good okay at this point it looks
like<00:03:05.170> we<00:03:06.100> need<00:03:06.130> to<00:03:06.310> make<00:03:06.489> a<00:03:06.519> few<00:03:06.850> little<00:03:07.120> fine

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
like we need to make a few little fine

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.690 
like we need to make a few little fine
adjustments<00:03:08.680> make<00:03:08.950> sure<00:03:09.160> it's<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:09.489> bigger

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
adjustments make sure it's the bigger

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.150 
adjustments make sure it's the bigger
pieces<00:03:10.030> are<00:03:10.330> stuck<00:03:10.660> down<00:03:10.690> in<00:03:10.900> there<00:03:11.319> and<00:03:11.800> then

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
pieces are stuck down in there and then

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.500 
pieces are stuck down in there and then
we're<00:03:12.250> gonna<00:03:12.370> run<00:03:12.580> water<00:03:12.850> through<00:03:12.970> the<00:03:13.300> pot

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
we're gonna run water through the pot

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.809 
we're gonna run water through the pot
rinse<00:03:13.870> off<00:03:14.080> the<00:03:14.260> leaves<00:03:14.470> and<00:03:15.340> this<00:03:15.489> will<00:03:15.640> help

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
rinse off the leaves and this will help

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.320 
rinse off the leaves and this will help
settle<00:03:16.209> the<00:03:16.239> bark<00:03:16.860> now<00:03:17.860> this<00:03:18.100> fail<00:03:18.760> had<00:03:19.300> a

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
settle the bark now this fail had a

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.030 
settle the bark now this fail had a
spike<00:03:19.690> on<00:03:19.870> it<00:03:20.019> before<00:03:20.260> we<00:03:20.350> started<00:03:20.620> reciting

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
spike on it before we started reciting

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.610 
spike on it before we started reciting
it<00:03:21.430> and<00:03:21.700> here's<00:03:22.209> its<00:03:22.390> stake<00:03:22.780> and<00:03:23.050> butterfly

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
it and here's its stake and butterfly

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.920 
it and here's its stake and butterfly
clip<00:03:23.950> that<00:03:24.370> holds<00:03:24.519> the<00:03:24.760> spike<00:03:25.390> so<00:03:25.690> when<00:03:25.840> it

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
clip that holds the spike so when it

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.229 
clip that holds the spike so when it
comes<00:03:26.110> with<00:03:26.709> a<00:03:26.739> new<00:03:26.950> spike<00:03:27.250> we'll<00:03:27.760> be<00:03:27.970> able<00:03:28.060> to

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
comes with a new spike we'll be able to

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.289 
comes with a new spike we'll be able to
be<00:03:28.360> able<00:03:28.630> to<00:03:28.750> put<00:03:29.110> that<00:03:29.260> on<00:03:29.380> there<00:03:30.030> one<00:03:31.030> very

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
important part of this is to make sure

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.819 
important part of this is to make sure
you<00:03:33.790> have<00:03:33.970> an<00:03:34.120> ID<00:03:34.420> for<00:03:35.230> your<00:03:35.350> orchid<00:03:35.680> this

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
you have an ID for your orchid this

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.460 
you have an ID for your orchid this
orchid<00:03:36.280> did<00:03:36.730> not<00:03:36.940> come<00:03:37.299> with<00:03:37.540> a<00:03:37.570> tag<00:03:37.900> so<00:03:38.260> it's

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
orchid did not come with a tag so it's

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.120 
orchid did not come with a tag so it's
going<00:03:38.680> to<00:03:38.829> be<00:03:38.950> called<00:03:39.190> an<00:03:39.459> OID<00:03:40.049> Phalaenopsis

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
going to be called an OID Phalaenopsis

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.199 
going to be called an OID Phalaenopsis
but<00:03:42.130> we're<00:03:42.250> gonna<00:03:42.340> put<00:03:42.579> that<00:03:42.700> on<00:03:42.820> the<00:03:43.000> tag
