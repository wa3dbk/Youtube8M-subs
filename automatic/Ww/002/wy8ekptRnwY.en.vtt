00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
when they're through the end pin it just

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.670 
when they're through the end pin it just
that<00:02:42.420> honest<00:02:42.690> just<00:02:42.900> keeps<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.290> two<00:02:43.440> of<00:02:43.560> those

this overall length is 41 inches body
thicknesses<00:03:21.180> I've<00:03:21.390> said<00:03:22.380> three<00:03:22.830> inches<00:03:23.190> thick

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
scale length is the 25 and a half inches

scale length is the 25 and a half inches
the<00:03:28.230> nut<00:03:28.440> width<00:03:28.739> is<00:03:29.070> an<00:03:29.459> inch<00:03:29.640> and<00:03:29.760> 3/4<00:03:31.250> the

the nut width is an inch and 3/4 the

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.510 
the nut width is an inch and 3/4 the
weight<00:03:32.580> they<00:03:33.209> say<00:03:33.450> it's<00:03:33.600> 10<00:03:33.870> pounds<00:03:34.110> I<00:03:34.560> doubt

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
weight they say it's 10 pounds I doubt

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.550 
weight they say it's 10 pounds I doubt
that<00:03:35.760> it<00:03:35.880> weighs<00:03:36.060> 10<00:03:36.870> pounds<00:03:36.900> I<00:03:37.290> think<00:03:37.320> it's

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
that it weighs 10 pounds I think it's

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.830 
that it weighs 10 pounds I think it's
lighter<00:03:37.770> than<00:03:37.920> that<00:03:38.280> it<00:03:38.940> does<00:03:39.150> have<00:03:39.420> a<00:03:39.480> truss

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
lighter than that it does have a truss

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.800 
lighter than that it does have a truss
rod<00:03:40.170> and<00:03:40.590> it<00:03:40.980> is<00:03:41.190> adjustable<00:03:41.880> through<00:03:42.660> the

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
rod and it is adjustable through the

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.460 
rod and it is adjustable through the
resonator<00:03:43.350> hole<00:03:43.650> if<00:03:43.920> you<00:03:44.310> need<00:03:44.489> to<00:03:44.700> do<00:03:44.850> that

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
resonator hole if you need to do that

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.440 
resonator hole if you need to do that
now<00:03:46.470> for<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.920> really<00:03:47.280> amazing<00:03:47.550> part<00:03:48.120> at<00:03:48.330> least

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
now for the really amazing part at least

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.140 
now for the really amazing part at least
I<00:03:48.690> think<00:03:48.750> so<00:03:49.020> the<00:03:49.770> list<00:03:50.010> price<00:03:50.310> on<00:03:50.700> this<00:03:50.940> was

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
I think so the list price on this was

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.250 
I think so the list price on this was
stated<00:03:51.390> right<00:03:51.690> at<00:03:51.870> $300<00:03:52.970> but<00:03:53.970> this<00:03:54.870> brand<00:03:55.110> new

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
stated right at $300 but this brand new

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.140 
stated right at $300 but this brand new
guitar<00:03:55.410> costs<00:03:55.920> me<00:03:56.100> 70<00:03:57.290> $9.97<00:03:58.290> plus<00:03:59.100> 14<00:03:59.670> dollars
