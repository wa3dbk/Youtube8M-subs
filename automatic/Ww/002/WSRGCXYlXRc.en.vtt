Chicago the Packers are a point and a

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.200 
Chicago the Packers are a point and a
half<00:01:49.110> favorite<00:01:49.770> on<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.100> road<00:01:50.310> Charles<00:01:51.060> what

do<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.329> think<00:01:51.619> well<00:01:52.619> Aaron<00:01:52.979> Rodgers<00:01:53.369> told<00:01:53.610> me

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
do you think well Aaron Rodgers told me

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:54.620 
do you think well Aaron Rodgers told me
to<00:01:54.030> relax

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
to relax

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.959 
to relax
Aaron<00:01:55.290> Rodgers<00:01:55.439> is<00:01:55.799> probably<00:01:56.219> my<00:01:56.460> favorite

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
Aaron Rodgers is probably my favorite

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.660 
Aaron Rodgers is probably my favorite
quarterback<00:01:57.509> in<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.780> NFL<00:01:57.810> so<00:01:58.560> i'ma<00:01:58.979> go<00:01:59.310> with

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
quarterback in the NFL so i'ma go with

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.999 
quarterback in the NFL so i'ma go with
the<00:02:00.360> Packers<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:01.229> think<00:02:01.469> that<00:02:01.710> they<00:02:01.829> know

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
the Packers and I think that they know

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.889 
the Packers and I think that they know
this<00:02:02.159> is<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.369> must-win<00:02:02.759> they<00:02:03.030> cannot<00:02:03.329> go<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.630> 1

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
this is a must-win they cannot go to 1

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.990 
this is a must-win they cannot go to 1
and<00:02:04.110> 3<00:02:04.290> so<00:02:04.320> I'm<00:02:04.530> going<00:02:04.770> with<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.009> packs<00:02:05.219> not<00:02:05.790> so

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
and 3 so I'm going with the packs not so

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.940 
and 3 so I'm going with the packs not so
Charles<00:02:06.390> I<00:02:06.570> think<00:02:06.930> that's<00:02:07.110> what<00:02:07.229> crazy<00:02:07.469> pick

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
Charles I think that's what crazy pick

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.090 
Charles I think that's what crazy pick
right<00:02:08.190> there<00:02:09.229> it<00:02:10.229> is<00:02:10.800> really<00:02:11.099> I<00:02:11.520> will

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
right there it is really I will

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.190 
right there it is really I will
go<00:02:12.190> with<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:12.460> Bears<00:02:12.880> we<00:02:13.000> got<00:02:13.210> Jay<00:02:13.780> Cutler's

is<00:02:21.610> flustered<00:02:22.030> right<00:02:22.300> now<00:02:22.510> but<00:02:22.900> it<00:02:23.050> it's<00:02:23.560> a

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
is flustered right now but it it's a

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.210 
is flustered right now but it it's a
good<00:02:24.010> it<00:02:24.340> I<00:02:25.440> think<00:02:26.440> it's<00:02:26.560> gonna<00:02:26.710> be<00:02:26.920> a<00:02:26.950> good
