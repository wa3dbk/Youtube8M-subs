00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.840
 as well as made exclusively for that video that

 attitudes a third call taylor lautner 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.230
 they are going through clients I wanted to know how can I do 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.040
 to educate her a little more 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.360
 henceforth hit a punishment 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.030
 only a punishment 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.500
 that although it can function is a punishment that can stimulate 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.750
 aggressiveness of the animal 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.230
 can leave him scared of quick movements, I love it here, for example 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.100
 I'm going to give you an example here. 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.060
 face 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.720
 air 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.930
 She knows it's a party. 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.940
 if I hit a dog 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.750
 depending on the movement he thinks I'm going to hurt if I give a child 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.910
 wanting to hug it can get scared in the app store 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.090
 I have two karts jÃ©ci pio buck what it is that I do is that this area 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.760
 more of my house than putting many limits and 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.190
 contrary to the dogs they do not handle very well with seized tickets 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.229
 but they need to explore the territory 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.240
 we create for the theme of environmental enrichment 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.179
 we create things as legal as are provided by law 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:50.639
 and entertain themselves because then they begin to destroy - our beloved things give 

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:55.120
 a transformed in the same house does not have a sofa that he loves to destroy 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.310
 It was necessary to build, but do not forget to put something 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.250
 the side of the couch even because he's twice there and when I have 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.610
 dexterity can catch a good intake of water and the morning 

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:14.469
 enough already 

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:18.559
 the dog thinks that some of her cassation objects 

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:21.559
 I would like to know how to end this possibility. 

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:26.419
 usually those behaviors that the person is not that are more radical in that 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:29.019
 they attack the dog owners themselves 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.439
 population takes care of a cushion no longer wear the person connect the 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:36.709
 computer, in fact the answer was not late at that time in that 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.349
 you should not face or argue with the 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.719
 What should you do on a daily basis? 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:45.569
 is passing on information from him of who commands 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.869
 when he that something you are of a command then even a fondness 

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:53.579
 so it's always a good idea to check out the time and spend the 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:57.099
 part of the day out we still do not have pets 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:01.319
 in this case which met with fidel can not simply dislike 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.019
 be alone 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.359
 so if you go for a long time alone 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.359
 is and therefore that she has more than one dog for him to have company 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:13.370
 two dogs are all right to be left alone a longer period since 

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:16.529
 have conditions in addition to 

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:20.419
 For example, you can spend more time alone 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:24.249
 presumption comes late the whole house is empty all day such 

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:27.110
 then suitable 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.919
 fish it if you do not have no problem 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:34.319
 leave you need to have catch 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.109
 bh temperature and lighting all correct 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.979
 sometimes you do not need even every day 

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:46.519
 according to the amount of time the person has been in the presence of the 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:47.869
 can not have a 

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:49.529
 or other animated
