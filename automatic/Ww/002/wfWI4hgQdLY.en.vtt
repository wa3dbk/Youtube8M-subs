00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:44.410 
Ricky and gold but we also had some
tremendous<00:03:42.830> character<00:03:43.340> guys<00:03:43.790> on<00:03:44.030> the<00:03:44.090> team<00:03:44.239> as

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
tremendous character guys on the team as

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.850 
tremendous character guys on the team as
well<00:03:44.599> that<00:03:44.810> we<00:03:44.900> had<00:03:44.989> gotten<00:03:45.140> late<00:03:45.470> in<00:03:45.590> the<00:03:45.680> year

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
well that we had gotten late in the year

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.820 
well that we had gotten late in the year
and<00:03:46.360> if<00:03:47.360> you<00:03:47.480> but<00:03:48.050> if<00:03:48.170> you<00:03:48.260> really<00:03:48.530> look<00:03:48.709> at

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
and if you but if you really look at

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.410 
and if you but if you really look at
it's<00:03:49.010> probably<00:03:49.310> not<00:03:49.459> the<00:03:49.489> most<00:03:49.670> talented<00:03:50.180> team

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
it's probably not the most talented team

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.050 
it's probably not the most talented team
that<00:03:50.629> everyone<00:03:51.050> is<00:03:51.200> down<00:03:51.319> the<00:03:51.500> cup<00:03:51.709> from<00:03:52.670> from

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
that everyone is down the cup from from

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.790 
that everyone is down the cup from from
from<00:03:53.569> the<00:03:53.720> top<00:03:54.080> of<00:03:54.110> the<00:03:54.260> line<00:03:54.410> up<00:03:54.590> to<00:03:54.709> the

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
from the top of the line up to the

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.740 
from the top of the line up to the
bottom<00:03:55.130> but<00:03:55.670> we<00:03:55.790> certainly<00:03:56.000> found<00:03:56.360> a<00:03:56.540> way<00:03:56.690> to

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
bottom but we certainly found a way to

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.110 
bottom but we certainly found a way to
play<00:03:57.410> and<00:03:57.650> play<00:03:57.800> well<00:03:58.069> together<00:03:58.280> and<00:03:58.700> we

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
play and play well together and we

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.910 
play and play well together and we
certainly<00:03:59.390> really<00:03:59.930> enjoyed<00:04:00.260> each<00:04:00.410> other<00:04:00.650> and

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
certainly really enjoyed each other and

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.449 
certainly really enjoyed each other and
I<00:04:01.099> think<00:04:01.340> all<00:04:01.610> those<00:04:01.760> things<00:04:02.060> are<00:04:03.250> the<00:04:04.250> only

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
I think all those things are the only

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.690 
I think all those things are the only
way<00:04:04.819> that<00:04:05.030> I<00:04:05.060> knew<00:04:05.360> success<00:04:06.200> could<00:04:06.379> be<00:04:06.700> good

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
way that I knew success could be good

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.789 
way that I knew success could be good
calmness<00:04:08.150> is<00:04:08.450> to<00:04:08.750> try<00:04:09.110> to<00:04:09.140> create<00:04:09.380> that<00:04:09.620> kind

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
calmness is to try to create that kind

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.009 
calmness is to try to create that kind
of<00:04:09.980> atmosphere<00:04:10.459> with<00:04:11.209> the<00:04:11.330> team<00:04:11.569> and<00:04:11.780> like<00:04:11.900> I

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
of atmosphere with the team and like I

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:14.830 
of atmosphere with the team and like I
said<00:04:12.519> it<00:04:13.519> made<00:04:13.700> it<00:04:13.819> much<00:04:14.000> easier<00:04:14.060> having<00:04:14.599> the

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
said it made it much easier having the

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.229 
said it made it much easier having the
support<00:04:15.230> from<00:04:15.470> the<00:04:15.620> from<00:04:16.459> the<00:04:16.549> management<00:04:16.880> and
