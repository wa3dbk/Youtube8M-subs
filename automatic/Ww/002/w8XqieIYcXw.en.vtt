00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.880
 Hello to all of you goes and this advice 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.160
 how to fix your mouse 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:16.440
 I personally have a steelseries company 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:20.550
 and this mouse became a service so my reasons 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:25.340
 palms was such that this cottage as he 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:32.579
 calls began to fit that is 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:36.480
 disassembled it into four parts what here 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:42.870
 shown in the figure we will see that here 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.680
 it's a piece of iron that's cool on this 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:50.850
 wheels 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:52.949
 the combat will and this one is a sensor 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:58.140
 the sensor breaks constantly 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:00.800
 many users and few people 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.739
 knows how to fix it 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.990
 the whole secret is that you need to make out 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.979
 us wheel 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:14.210
 disassemble this sensor to clean it 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:18.210
 using a cotton pad and wand me 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:23.390
 so put all the alcohol wipe also 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:27.780
 inside all put the pieces together 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.820
 lubricate with household oil or 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.360
 some other 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:35.180
 but aside from not sunflower it is accurate and 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:39.329
 insert or back wheel 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:43.500
 option 2 if you are not clogged 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:45.960
 nothing with you mass of old dried up in 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:50.630
 this sensor you can just clamp 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:53.579
 antennae which is located behind 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:57.420
 behind the wheel somewhere wheel 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:02:00.710
 see so there is still 48 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:06.540
 which is reflected help forging 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:09.819
 but to clamp the antennae here I have 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:15.310
 sensor that prevents the launch of cucumbers 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:19.739
 and you can not ballista yes how to fix 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.739
 mouse more precisely and disassemble 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:34.239
 the legs of the gliding we unstick them there will be 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:38.620
 4 bolts each burst glue many times 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:42.569
 five legs of time from your face and not 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:46.840
 will attach more when the blade 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:54.060
 unscrew look can disable 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:59.919
 payment clean and here's the case itself 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:01.689
 Mouse so can his, too, if clean 

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:04.840
 the problem is not solved 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:07.810
 if you cleaned it squeezed the antennae 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:12.669
 have done everything and have you continue to pursue 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:17.079
 bags then I will advise you to find your 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:20.709
 old mouse and take out not this sensor 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:23.129
 It begins to melt take it too dress 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.239
 The concept of this sensor is to attach a new one. 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:30.090
 put the wheel and everything will be 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:34.870
 work online I have not seen that someone 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:40.479
 filmed a video on the repair on the advice 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:44.489
 how to fix the mouse trunk pony series here 

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:47.859
 I think I explained to you normally lowered 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:50.949
 on my personal experience I checked that it 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:54.549
 in fact it's true that I fixed my 100 

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:57.879
 its a new mouse which costs 2000 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:04:02.680
 rubles is not a pity of course it was if she 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:06.159
 It worked but I did the right thing in 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:10.090
 I got a mouse now and normal 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:13.299
