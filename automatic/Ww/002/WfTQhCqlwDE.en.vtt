 environmental agent 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.690
 are very easy materials that people 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.250
 can buy in the central market in 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.650
 any pharmacy two products 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:12.960
 main power to the mix 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:15.479
 one of them is the cereal alcohol person 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.860

 more for the camera to show us 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.840
 that aside 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.320
 what else will they use and here's the person 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:41.119
