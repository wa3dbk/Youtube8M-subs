so many students always ask me well what
am<00:03:24.480> I<00:03:24.629> supposed<00:03:24.659> to<00:03:25.049> actually<00:03:25.290> do<00:03:25.650> when<00:03:25.889> I<00:03:25.920> sit

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
am I supposed to actually do when I sit

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.170 
am I supposed to actually do when I sit
down<00:03:26.519> before<00:03:27.329> I<00:03:27.569> put<00:03:27.930> my<00:03:28.109> pen<00:03:28.560> to<00:03:29.129> paper<00:03:29.310> okay

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
down before I put my pen to paper okay

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.119 
down before I put my pen to paper okay
there<00:03:30.900> are<00:03:31.049> a<00:03:31.230> number<00:03:31.260> of<00:03:31.650> things<00:03:31.829> that<00:03:31.980> you

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
there are a number of things that you

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.670 
there are a number of things that you
should<00:03:32.370> think<00:03:32.669> about<00:03:32.849> and<00:03:33.329> if<00:03:33.989> you<00:03:34.470> think

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
should think about and if you think

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.800 
should think about and if you think
about<00:03:34.739> these<00:03:35.040> in<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.370> right<00:03:35.609> way<00:03:35.819> then<00:03:36.660> it

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
about these in the right way then it

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.509 
about these in the right way then it
means<00:03:36.930> you're<00:03:37.199> not<00:03:37.410> going<00:03:37.709> to<00:03:37.829> waste<00:03:38.040> any<00:03:38.370> time

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
means you're not going to waste any time

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.119 
means you're not going to waste any time
you're<00:03:39.419> going<00:03:39.599> to<00:03:39.690> get<00:03:39.780> on<00:03:39.959> with<00:03:40.169> it<00:03:40.199> and<00:03:40.500> that

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:41.129 
you're going to get on with it and that

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:42.979 
you're going to get on with it and that
means<00:03:41.370> you<00:03:41.579> will<00:03:41.730> be<00:03:41.760> able<00:03:41.970> to<00:03:42.239> do<00:03:42.359> the<00:03:42.510> test<00:03:42.750> in

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
means you will be able to do the test in

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.520 
means you will be able to do the test in
the<00:03:43.349> 20<00:03:43.709> minutes<00:03:43.739> that's<00:03:44.220> been<00:03:44.430> given<00:03:44.760> to<00:03:44.790> you

the 20 minutes that's been given to you
so<00:03:47.329> this<00:03:48.329> is<00:03:48.599> my<00:03:48.720> advice<00:03:49.669> first<00:03:50.669> of<00:03:50.879> all<00:03:51.199> seems

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:52.199 
so this is my advice first of all seems

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:54.470 
so this is my advice first of all seems
very<00:03:52.319> obvious<00:03:52.709> to<00:03:53.129> say<00:03:53.280> this<00:03:53.489> but<00:03:53.819> you<00:03:54.209> must

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
very obvious to say this but you must

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.699 
very obvious to say this but you must
read<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:55.079> question<00:03:55.620> very<00:03:56.040> carefully<00:03:56.239> okay

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
read the question very carefully okay

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.039 
read the question very carefully okay
very<00:03:58.709> often<00:03:58.970> students<00:03:59.970> read<00:04:00.299> the<00:04:00.510> question

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
very often students read the question

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:04.759 
very often students read the question
very<00:04:01.709> quickly<00:04:02.180> they<00:04:03.180> pick<00:04:03.419> out<00:04:03.599> one<00:04:04.470> main

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
very quickly they pick out one main

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.819 
very quickly they pick out one main
point<00:04:05.449> but<00:04:06.449> they<00:04:06.569> don't<00:04:06.780> pick<00:04:06.989> out<00:04:07.169> any<00:04:07.470> other

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
point but they don't pick out any other

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:10.369 
point but they don't pick out any other
main<00:04:08.099> points<00:04:08.549> and<00:04:08.790> they<00:04:09.180> end<00:04:09.329> up<00:04:09.510> not

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 
main points and they end up not

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:12.349 
main points and they end up not
understanding<00:04:11.340> what<00:04:11.519> the<00:04:11.669> graph<00:04:11.879> is<00:04:12.090> about

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
understanding what the graph is about

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:14.809 
understanding what the graph is about
completely<00:04:13.049> and<00:04:13.260> so<00:04:13.980> they<00:04:14.250> answer<00:04:14.699> the

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
completely and so they answer the

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:16.580 
completely and so they answer the
question<00:04:15.269> in<00:04:15.449> a<00:04:15.599> different<00:04:15.629> way<00:04:16.139> to<00:04:16.169> what's

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
question in a different way to what's

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.460 
question in a different way to what's
expected<00:04:17.010> so<00:04:17.370> they<00:04:17.880> almost<00:04:18.239> end<00:04:18.659> up<00:04:18.900> answering

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
expected so they almost end up answering

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.009 
expected so they almost end up answering
a<00:04:20.220> different<00:04:20.940> question<00:04:21.329> a<00:04:21.389> question<00:04:21.510> that

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
a different question a question that

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.920
