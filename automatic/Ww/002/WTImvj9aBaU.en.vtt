00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.009
 it's the girls welcome to my 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.420
 garden today I show the little ones 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.000
 bags I made recently for 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.950
 summer because the season a bit bad 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.440
 started then there are full there are goals 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.440
 everywhere but there will be a dress that are 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.060
 really very nice a store and 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.070
 I have h and some I get out 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.199
 today so let's start with h &amp; m 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.350
 because philippe schaller first 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.750
 if as a collective it is not a comma 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.640
 shopping I acted this block which is blue 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.599
 who follows a maxi dress that I like 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.759
 very much 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.920
 she is super comfortable very 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.450
 long the right length then I 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.969
 really looking for a wheel with 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.280
 suspenders in this kind then more 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.690
 narrow and it's a perfect match I 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.980
 also bought a dress a little more chic 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.289
 because of ben ali 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.210
 if I handle for my boyfriend so is 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.800
 otherwise a beautiful white dress takes 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.660
 still charles cost like 15 dollars 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.370
 and she is really very much the line 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.520
 still good length for the summer 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.530
 then I like many have 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.210
 kohler if a little transparency with him 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.739
 like heart-shaped I really like 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.899
 nothing for that also 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.549
 comfortable also so this bucumi gie and 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.310
 my favorite at h &amp; m I would say that 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.720
 if this lucky and white camisole that 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.760
 with the bullies and what to look for 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.080
 and I'm not comfortable I find that 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.409
 I can win with many things 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.549
 and make it chic but also it's that 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.500
 I cried every day it's 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.200
 really really fun is to my taste 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.540
 the texture is great the fun they will have to 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.250
 a lot then really it's a shot of 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.850
 heart in celebration changes nothing in store the 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.439
 in the buses 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.850
 so I thought, do you 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.860
 fun it was white 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.909
 the game revolves around the little bit 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.799
 trompe l'oeil is a white 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.250
 so I had to try and then more 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.680
 it's like in the h &amp; m collection when 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.270
 shale so it's good it's good 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.890
 does power out of respect for 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.170
 the environment with the materials that 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.939
 are renewable 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.460
 I liked too I went to gap 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.990
 because in my job I speak to 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.000
 tourist in an attraction of my 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.500
 area and I needed some owls 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.570
 because what better than a 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.110
 guide for a guide that to address on 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.909
 page 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.290
 so we see in Gabon really 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.780
 find very very beautiful who are going 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.340
 very well and if you have the buttocks a 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.100
 little flat really it's players who 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.350
 are ready 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.240
 because sailors like that can she do that 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.819
 does really much more than me but at 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:16.000
 screw group that comes from gap warehouses 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:18.310
 usually and cost 44 and it seems to me 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.680
 that I had to pay 27 may they are 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.420
 super comfortable the right length 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.280
 the size makes the buttocks or if 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.569
 they were pockets of the real ones 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.020
 pochon it's really nice 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:31.300
 then that's it so that's the style it's 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.550
 the style should be friends and I finally 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.959
 found a jeans jacket that I liked 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.430
 it really was as I 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.050
 wanted one that I'm looking for and then I 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.340
 did not find it ever made me good 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.489
 the color I do not have but there is 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.170
 found a gap again we say 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.330
 otherwise small gap between shots then 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.940
 really at the end not comfortable steel 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.290
 adjusted but not too much there are posts 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.190
 I really like the buttons that are 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.140
 as bronze 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.050
 I really like books and my 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.310
 mother also buying a mom I was 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.530
 with my bags from gap was like 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.019
 cashed to buy that I ride amounts 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.540
 to hire gap and comes back with both 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:07.569
 same things it was and these shorts 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.130
 so a wrong step out at the same time 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.079
 clothes the same because it would be a 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.010
 little bit this logo finally message is 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.290
 really that because I can him 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.280
 bring with skirts with dresses 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.660
 maxi with shocks 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.060
 really we can bring all the time 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.010
 you love me he was bedridden pretends 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.299
 summer and autumn with my winter but 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.340
 I really like what I really 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:26.890
 happy we finally found m and 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.930
 also i actually went to mega ce 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.329
 is only my boyfriend because he wanted 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.440
 have bermuda up sweaters then 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.579
 we went home to uneven mentee 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.380
 because he's like that in the 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.670
 store I had a skirt that was 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.540
 really beautiful but was just bad 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.940
 is wide 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.560
 so I do on the citizen can in 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.329
 evening then I ordered there I can at 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.549
 medium so is the size that made me 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:47.140
 and her ranks of the game really wears her 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:50.140
 but really often because I like 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.780
 a lot it's an extensible black skirt 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.150
 with a shape on the side it's great 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.799
 comfortable it's his troop we walk 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.480
 really good with because the leg I 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.609
 request can walk freely 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.170
 that's who's really con fake 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:05.500
 since it's like there's 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.450
 a mini skirt underneath so we note there 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.390
 do not be afraid that we will show our 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.590
 10 or 6 people the wind is not 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.160
 serious i do not want everything she is 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.180
 really light she 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.470
 super comfortable then again 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.570
 responsible for several things because 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.550
 that she is black also says m 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.620
 I went to sports experts because 

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:24.140
 that he has long since I like to know 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.370
 a shirt of notation must I eat 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.630
 a lot but this summer I can I 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.420
 it's a little bit of a danger and 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.550
 fall to go to the pool of my 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.590
 university to swim if I feel like it 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.850
 and I hope experts was there a 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.380
 promotion in the background all the jerseys 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.390
 which cost upwards of 50 dollars 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.500
 I had a discount of 10 from their top 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.510
 so I took advantage 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.060
 and in fact you tarnish aquasports 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.860
 kid's adventures there was nothing 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.520
 aquasports on saint jean if you know 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.290
 What am I talking about 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.440
 it was really disappointing there was very 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:53.120
 few models then is disappointing so I 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.860
 went to the sports experts to 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.850
 products that is really close and j 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.490
 ph and gets to work 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:01.850
 then I think it hurts a lot and 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.800
 so it's a speedo swimsuit 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.060
 or red like these at the toll 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.670
 if I will not show it to you on me 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.380
 because it's a little info genius 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:12.080
 on samba sow it's at melgven the speedo 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.490
 very very normal but what I like 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.430
 really a lot is the back because 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.560
 it's a bare back almost like this so 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.300
 they believe it's like a triangle to 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.490
 the back then sent back really 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.440
 comfortable and I have one last small 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.390
 esteem to introduce you it's for 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.310
 Apostle those moments that I actually ht 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.710
 and he knows the sicap last of the rock 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.690
 posay and drive a throttle 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.760
 epidermal restoration so what is it 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.410
 that it does it's also a moisturizing gel 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:40.610
 for the skin that is applied morning 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:42.320
 story is really helped for the 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.880
 scars of pimples or for any 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.770
 scar on the face that I have 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.290
 already started to miss a little 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.860
 difference but scar here are less 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.660
 related 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.520
 can I yourself that the texture of my 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.930
 skin improve so I like 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.370
 really what makes me the cosco sheo 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.650
 because I really have no good bo 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:00.169
 cosco is it's rating is 13 99 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.060
 so yeah frankly I'd like to march 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:03.919
 in the cegep still has two gables first 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.150
 closes on the subject because it makes 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:06.529

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.239
 let opening 

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:10.819
 but so far I really love 

00:06:08.239 --> 00:06:12.769
 so it was all smiling what I 

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:14.599
 bought for reality with respect to 

00:06:12.769 --> 00:06:16.599
 clothes I hope you liked 

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:18.859
 and I'm really thinking about doing a log book 

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:21.169
 soon because I like wine 

00:06:18.859 --> 00:06:22.219
 yellow when I bought and then I tell myself 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:24.439
 how do I wear it 

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:25.699
 so if you're interested you do it 

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:28.729
