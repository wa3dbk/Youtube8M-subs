00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
we hooked up to an xbox which is how I

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.810 
we hooked up to an xbox which is how I
know<00:01:13.110> it's<00:01:13.380> not<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.590> cabling<00:01:14.130> especially

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
know it's not the cabling especially

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.779 
know it's not the cabling especially
since<00:01:14.969> I've<00:01:15.180> tried<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.420> bunch<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.780> different

00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:16.789 
since I've tried a bunch of different

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:25.060 
since I've tried a bunch of different
cables

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:32.450 

I<00:01:25.360> have

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:42.610 

to<00:01:33.460> power<00:01:33.729> bricks<00:01:33.970> as<00:01:34.150> you<00:01:34.240> can<00:01:34.390> see

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.410 

there's<00:01:43.250> one

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:56.270 

and<00:01:51.080> here's<00:01:52.080> two<00:01:52.790> and<00:01:54.500> i<00:01:55.500> have<00:01:55.830> two<00:01:56.010> dual-link

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
and here's two and i have two dual-link

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.109 
and here's two and i have two dual-link
DVI<00:01:56.729> cables<00:01:57.300> I<00:01:58.490> was<00:01:59.490> using<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.759> one<00:02:00.000> before

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
DVI cables I was using that one before

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.020 
DVI cables I was using that one before
and<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:01.229> included<00:02:01.650> one<00:02:01.830> is<00:02:01.950> black<00:02:02.220> and<00:02:05.030> the

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
and the included one is black and the

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.740 
and the included one is black and the
monitor<00:02:06.420> keeps<00:02:06.659> flickering<00:02:07.850> so<00:02:08.850> I<00:02:09.209> guess<00:02:09.450> has

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
monitor keeps flickering so I guess has

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.860 
monitor keeps flickering so I guess has
to<00:02:09.959> go<00:02:10.110> back<00:02:11.690> because<00:02:12.690> it<00:02:12.959> is<00:02:13.140> defective
