not know how to do this I'll have a link

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.609 
not know how to do this I'll have a link

on the screen to a full tutorial on how
to<00:00:22.769> get<00:00:22.980> outside<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.730> map<00:00:23.910> but<00:00:24.420> basically

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
to get outside of the map but basically

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.870 
to get outside of the map but basically
all<00:00:25.109> you<00:00:25.199> need<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.439> do<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:25.800> go<00:00:26.279> prone<00:00:26.609> in<00:00:26.640> this

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
all you need to do is go prone in this

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.970 
all you need to do is go prone in this
corner<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.539> want<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.260> hold<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.769> left

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
corner and you want to hold to the left

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.980 
corner and you want to hold to the left
then<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:29.640> need<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.970> running<00:00:30.240> zombie<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.810> run

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
then you need a running zombie to run

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.269 
then you need a running zombie to run
into<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.289> back<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:31.980> if<00:00:32.099> done

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
into the back of you and if done

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.010 
into the back of you and if done
correctly<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.969> zombie<00:00:33.540> will<00:00:33.690> push<00:00:33.870> you

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
correctly the zombie will push you

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.180 
correctly the zombie will push you
straight<00:00:34.320> through<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.620> wall<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:34.980> you're

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
straight through the wall and you're

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.100 
straight through the wall and you're
outside<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.910> map<00:00:36.090> but<00:00:36.630> this<00:00:36.809> glitch<00:00:37.079> is

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
outside of the map but this glitch is

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.110 
outside of the map but this glitch is
all<00:00:37.440> about<00:00:37.680> luck<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.430> may<00:00:38.610> take<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:38.940> quite

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
all about luck and it may take you quite

a<00:00:39.180> few<00:00:39.390> tries<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:40.010> was<00:00:41.010> luckily<00:00:41.250> able<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.820> get

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
a few tries I was luckily able to get

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.760 
a few tries I was luckily able to get
outside<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.450> map<00:00:42.570> on<00:00:42.780> my<00:00:42.840> fourth<00:00:43.290> attempt

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
outside of the map on my fourth attempt

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.440 
outside of the map on my fourth attempt
but<00:00:44.280> as<00:00:44.399> soon<00:00:44.550> as<00:00:44.610> you're<00:00:44.789> outside<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.270> map

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
but as soon as you're outside the map

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.420 
but as soon as you're outside the map
all<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:46.020> need<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.170> do<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.500> follow<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:47.070> where<00:00:47.399> I

go and as you can see where my friend
danny<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:50.610> shot<00:00:50.820> on<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.090> floor<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.989> need<00:00:52.199> to

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
danny is shot on the floor you need to

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.350 
danny is shot on the floor you need to
edge<00:00:52.649> around<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.250> invisible<00:00:53.789> barrier<00:00:54.149> and

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
edge around the invisible barrier and

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.119 
edge around the invisible barrier and
then<00:00:54.750> what<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.050> need<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.320> do<00:00:55.440> when<00:00:55.949> you're

friend a shot on the floor you simply
just<00:01:00.120> edged<00:01:00.480> backwards<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.350> you'll<00:01:01.800> slowly

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
just edged backwards and you'll slowly

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.609 
just edged backwards and you'll slowly
drop<00:01:02.460> down<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.180> layer<00:01:03.359> below<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.750> map<00:01:04.080> now

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
drop down to the layer below the map now

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.560 
drop down to the layer below the map now
this<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:05.070> not<00:01:05.250> fully<00:01:05.519> under<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.880> map<00:01:06.060> this<00:01:06.330> is

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
this is not fully under the map this is

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.780 
this is not fully under the map this is
a<00:01:06.600> partially<00:01:07.560> under<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.830> map<00:01:07.979> there's<00:01:08.430> three

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
a partially under the map there's three

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.100 
a partially under the map there's three
layers<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.180> this<00:01:09.299> map<00:01:09.570> there's<00:01:09.840> obviously

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
layers to this map there's obviously

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.230 
layers to this map there's obviously
ground<00:01:10.500> level<00:01:10.830> there's<00:01:11.340> this<00:01:11.549> layer<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.090> then

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
ground level there's this layer and then

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.090 
ground level there's this layer and then
there's<00:01:12.450> fully<00:01:12.689> under<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.140> map<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.799> I'm<00:01:13.890> sure

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
there's fully under the map and I'm sure

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.740 
there's fully under the map and I'm sure
many<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.549> many<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.210> actually<00:01:15.360> know

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
many of you many of you actually know

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.630 
many of you many of you actually know
how<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:15.930> get<00:01:16.170> fully<00:01:16.409> under<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.740> map<00:01:16.920> but<00:01:17.430> when

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
how to get fully under the map but when

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.030 
how to get fully under the map but when
you're<00:01:17.759> on<00:01:17.850> this<00:01:17.970> layer<00:01:18.180> you're<00:01:18.509> able<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:19.140> walk

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
you're on this layer you're able to walk

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.130 
you're on this layer you're able to walk
under<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.490> spawn<00:01:20.880> you're<00:01:21.360> quite<00:01:21.630> limited<00:01:22.020> to

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
under the spawn you're quite limited to

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.450 
under the spawn you're quite limited to
where<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.380> can<00:01:22.530> go<00:01:22.680> because<00:01:23.009> there's<00:01:23.130> quite<00:01:23.430> a

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
where you can go because there's quite a
