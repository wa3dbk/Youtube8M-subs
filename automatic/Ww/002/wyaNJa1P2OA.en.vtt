clean<00:02:12.640> break<00:02:12.670> if<00:02:13.390> you<00:02:13.510> let<00:02:13.660> it<00:02:13.780> sit<00:02:13.930> for<00:02:14.170> longer

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
clean break if you let it sit for longer

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.950 
clean break if you let it sit for longer
more<00:02:15.190> of<00:02:15.460> the<00:02:15.610> liquid<00:02:16.060> will<00:02:16.270> come<00:02:16.510> out<00:02:16.690> and

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
more of the liquid will come out and

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.780 
more of the liquid will come out and
that's<00:02:17.140> what<00:02:17.380> you<00:02:17.500> want<00:02:17.650> to<00:02:17.710> have<00:02:17.830> happen<00:02:18.010> so<00:02:18.580> I

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
that's what you want to have happen so I

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.630

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
let it sit for a full hour before I cut

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.880 
let it sit for a full hour before I cut
it<00:02:21.760> so<00:02:22.630> I'll<00:02:22.780> see<00:02:22.960> you<00:02:23.050> in<00:02:23.200> another<00:02:23.320> half<00:02:23.770> an
