00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.940
 good to all and welcome to a new 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.520
 road tour that I'm going to start on my channel 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.980
 and with the call of duty 4 and good 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.349
 basically the root is going to call auto 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.419
 victory and you will be right now 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:21.099
 saying road to victory of what the fuck 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:24.340
 you're going to win a game and now 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:27.399
 you're going to end the time it's not going well 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.619
 consist of many chapters what I'm going 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:32.169
 to do is play a game of counting to 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.960
 all and I have to win but with all 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.460
 the weapons that are in the game with all 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.980
 the weapons that there are for example the first 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.750
 weapon that there is the main weapon m16 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.179
 you can see that of assault rifles that 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.499
 there is the m16 and what is this because I have 

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:46.960
 that win a game against all 

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:49.839
 with the m16 in a chapter I have to 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.170
 win a game against everyone with ak-47 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:55.120
 another with the m4 with the three with the 76 and 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.879
 I assure you that there are weapons that are very 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.170
 bad and good is going to be a while 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.659
 entertaining that I've been looking for 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.059
 also for youtube and nobody has done it 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:06.140
 I'm innovating a lot on the subject of 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.750
 series of chapters on youtube 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.540
 and it's basically all that's win 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.960
 the weapons a departure assault rifles 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.880
 your light machine guns 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.909
 shotguns precision rifles with everything 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.100
 yes yes good I do not know if you just saw it 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:26.330
 look at what weapon is here and look 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:29.740
 here in the call of duty 4 the famous 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:32.000
 dragon not that so many screams lifts me 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.650
 Well yes there is here and it will also be 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.840
 on the road to but before I have to win 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.940
 with all the weapons that there are and good the 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.800
 first is the m16 we have to win a 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.930
 departure with the m16 and good to remember that 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.270
 this is not going to be taken out or in a 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.250
 chapter number I'll get it the same with 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.720
 the m16 took three or four chapters in 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.090
 be the first against all who 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.890
 know and then with the 47 more the same 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.720
 with the m4 more of the same with what goes 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.780
 to be entertained is a long road to 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.030
 it's rouco road to victory with all the 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.250
 weapons or road to victory with m16 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.410
 after auto victory with an ak-47 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.750
 I can call it that or be names 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.030
 infinite and good the class that is 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.970
 created is this input let's play 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.770
 against all with the m16 without accessory 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.180
 m9 without accessory is pictures 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.550
 bomb force boom in front impact 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.410
 deep and fragmented and stunned 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.050
 Now for one, I have squadron for the moment 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.610
 pump because good is the best I see 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.130
 until I unlock the bandolier 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.530
 looks like the best thing but 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.080
 moment I take the bomb squad so 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.070
 Let's go there 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.070
 all against all 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.860
 to see you are going to find match is not worth 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:44.269
 perfect all against all in quagmire 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.760
 the truth that this map I like 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.769
 quite 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.760
 people tend to sniper almost 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.600
 forever 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.750
 but good 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.670
 just started two bars perfect two 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.420
 bars before voucher voucher voucher ok I already 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.420
 I was scaring uncle 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.909
 did not give 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.909
 my mother that does not die I'm leaving 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.080
 this since I did not see him kid martyrdom 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.180
 shit 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.740
 I knew I was going to see someone out there 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:41.740
 or perfect 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.740
 double 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:54.319
 my mother lad 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.120
 hey it's not the first time I see 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.560
 someone combat inhibitor in this game 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.450
 I'm serious, it 's the first time 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.130
 that I see someone with that advantage but 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.680
 inhibitor is basically the killer of 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.060
 modern warfare 3 is the first time 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.740
 I see someone with that advantage in this 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:12.260
 I'm telling you seriously 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:12.260
 my mother kid the rpt 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.970
 I want to unlock, he looks at me 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.560
 red dot for this gun fuck dude the 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.880
 uncle of the rpt is bursting if it is that 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:30.260
 I'm going to two bars look at it I have two 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:32.220
 bars there is the matter all the crux 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.990
 of the matter 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.540
 I'm not saying it looks like they are going to be taken out 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.860
 helicopter 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:41.900
 I knew the jodi moss lajo we gave all 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.640
 because the helicopters of this game do not 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.200
 have nothing to do with helicopters 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.240
 of other call of duty are the 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.639
 helicopters of this game burst 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.860
 but his 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:54.830
 hey no uncle seriously this this guy has already 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:05:01.430

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:02.810
 see xx sx and what xx 2011 pointed that 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.029
 name the kid should be the first 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.280
 piggy I see in the call of duty 4 the 

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:09.230
 first piggy I see 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.030
 and good if we add that they have 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.510
 twice as much connection as I do not 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.510
 I can do nothing 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.520
 that there's that son of a bitch who does not know 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:18.600
 moved from the site looking at him watching him look at him 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.009
 it has no waste 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.710
 it does not have waste to look at this son 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:25.270
 of whore 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.270
 look what pineapple you're going to eat 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.569
 that now does not give him a shot 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.569
 mysteriously you know 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.110
 my mother lad 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.430
 but 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.460
 we can still fix the game 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:09.070
 I do not know where it is or what a pity if there is one 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:12.000
 that already has 19 casualties that goes this, not what 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:12.000
 we can save neither of cunt 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:20.789
 the martyrdom knew 

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:24.499
 the fucking martyrdom that is an advantage in 

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:24.499
 this game that always comes out 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.460
 the fucking cock 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:41.110
 because I will be given the signal of the 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:41.110
 capturing a second 

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:50.649
 my uncle uncle who does not die who does not die 

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:50.649
 kid 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:57.780
 It's good that the third guy has won 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:59.610
 from the rp of truth to see how 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:03.090
 play uncle I do not know if the camera will be seen 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:04.980
 death does not do not see death chamber that 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.900
 I do not know if they are legal or not so good 

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:12.120
 this has been the first chapter of the road 

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:13.830
 to victory with m 16 to 4 and see you in 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.110
