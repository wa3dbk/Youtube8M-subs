 description and I'll say the lay 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.840
 let's go 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:35.550
 here we have 75 grams of sugar 80 grams 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:38.100
 tapioca mail 13 grams of rice flour 226 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.590
 milliliters of coconut milk about two pinches 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.930
 salt and 113 grams of one 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.570
 have sweet potato from the sweet potato 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.520
 I already times no matter the 113 km 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.520
 cut off we are missing now 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.210
 then we cut them into small pieces 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.340
 how exactly it does not matter then 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.660
 which is to lecture now dresses 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.000
 Just to make it better 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:07.229
 fits in the mixer and even now when 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.229
 Steaming is faster 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.729
 we'll give up the pieces 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.520
 baking paper in a prepared 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.450
 steam and cook for about 20 minutes 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.450
 until they are done 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.910
 after cooking, they come in the mixer 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:35.340
 where we get a pinch of salt and sugar 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:43.260
 Add and we puree now 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:47.970
 first then we give 55 grams from 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:52.130
 tableau camel and half of 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:56.150
 coconut milk is about 30 milliliters 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.150
 and mix that together properly 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.060
 this mass we can now the small 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.040
 heat resistant molds fill 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.540
 with some space for upwards 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.850
 let our second layer 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.600
 I leave so about 1 centimeter space 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.250
 up 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.380
 but of course that depends on something 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.050
 the form from where it fills in like 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.480
 there is a lot of space left 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.950
 how much space ten left 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.230
 our sweet potato layer we attenuate 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.310
 now for 20 minutes and need 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.000
 meanwhile the second shift 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.250
 together 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.300
 for that we give to the remaining 25 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.540
 gram tapioca mail 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:34.410
 the 13 grams rice flour again a pinch 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.600
 mix salt roughly and then give the 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.150
 other half of coconut milk are sitting so 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.340
 again, we mix that with 113 milliliters 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.780
 with each other until well mixed and 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.530
 then wait until the sweet potato layer 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.720
 is done 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.250
 after the 20 minutes of steaming comes the 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.790
 sweet potato layer again briefly from the 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.489
 damper 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.690
 around now the prepared pure coco 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.690
 layer on it 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.780
 All we have to do now is ten more 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.780
 Steam for several minutes 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.680
 Then we leave the cake something 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.880
 cool down and get them out of shape 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.620
 I had her back in my silicone 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.570
 because they are so pretty light on it 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.490
 come out but as already at 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.350
 Last time you can change it to others 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.360
 fill small heat resistant molds 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.100
 These are our finished vegans 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.720
 Grace with sweet potatoes and coconut milk 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.070
 and if you want you can too 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.660
 make the sweet potato layer 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.910
 the tastes alone also very delicious 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.490
 I hope you liked the recipe 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.540
