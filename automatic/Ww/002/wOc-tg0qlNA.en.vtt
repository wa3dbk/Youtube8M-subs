00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.699 
wherever you want on your computer in
our<00:03:38.519> case<00:03:38.730> we've<00:03:39.150> already<00:03:39.390> saved<00:03:39.840> one<00:03:40.079> to<00:03:40.590> the

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
our case we've already saved one to the

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.319 
our case we've already saved one to the
desktop<00:03:41.010> because<00:03:41.370> it<00:03:41.610> could<00:03:41.760> take<00:03:41.880> a<00:03:41.940> while<00:03:42.150> to

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
desktop because it could take a while to

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.180 
desktop because it could take a while to
transfer<00:03:42.780> so<00:03:43.230> that's<00:03:43.500> why<00:03:43.680> we've<00:03:43.890> kind<00:03:44.130> of

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
transfer so that's why we've kind of

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.710 
transfer so that's why we've kind of
done<00:03:44.370> when<00:03:44.640> the<00:03:44.700> head<00:03:44.820> of<00:03:44.910> time<00:03:45.030> okay<00:03:45.329> so<00:03:45.390> go

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
done when the head of time okay so go

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.110 
done when the head of time okay so go
ahead<00:03:45.810> and<00:03:45.930> pull<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:46.620> one<00:03:46.860> that<00:03:47.400> we<00:03:47.910> did

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
ahead and pull the one that we did

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.670 
ahead and pull the one that we did
earlier<00:03:48.150> so<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:49.049> one<00:03:49.200> that<00:03:49.320> we've<00:03:49.410> done<00:03:49.530> on

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
earlier so the one that we've done on

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.069 
earlier so the one that we've done on

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
ipad so then you would use some other

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.130 
ipad so then you would use some other
kind<00:04:51.890> of<00:04:52.220> screen<00:04:53.030> capturing<00:04:53.450> software<00:04:53.660> on<00:04:54.020> the

kind of screen capturing software on the
mac<00:04:54.880> to<00:04:55.880> be<00:04:56.030> able<00:04:56.150> to<00:04:56.360> capture<00:04:56.570> it<00:04:56.720> or<00:04:56.930> windows

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
mac to be able to capture it or windows

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.840 
mac to be able to capture it or windows
assumedly<00:04:57.800> depending<00:04:58.280> on<00:04:58.370> whatever<00:04:58.550> it<00:04:58.730> was

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
assumedly depending on whatever it was

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.390 
assumedly depending on whatever it was
so<00:04:59.150> absolutely<00:04:59.660> that's<00:05:00.650> how<00:05:00.800> we<00:05:00.890> bring<00:05:01.160> it<00:05:01.280> all

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
so absolutely that's how we bring it all

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.180 
so absolutely that's how we bring it all
together<00:05:01.520> is<00:05:02.200> once<00:05:03.200> it's<00:05:03.350> all<00:05:03.500> over<00:05:03.530> laid<00:05:03.980> like

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
together is once it's all over laid like

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.430 
together is once it's all over laid like
this<00:05:04.460> then<00:05:05.240> we<00:05:05.390> capture<00:05:05.810> it<00:05:05.840> again<00:05:06.230> with

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
this then we capture it again with

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.520 
this then we capture it again with
another<00:05:06.560> screen<00:05:07.160> capturing<00:05:08.030> software<00:05:08.540> and<00:05:09.020> in

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
another screen capturing software and in

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.290 
another screen capturing software and in
