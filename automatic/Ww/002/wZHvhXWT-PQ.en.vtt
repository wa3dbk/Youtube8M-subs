what<00:00:29.570> we<00:00:29.660> got<00:00:29.900> here<00:00:30.200> is<00:00:30.260> a<00:00:32.200> got<00:00:33.200> a<00:00:33.230> treats<00:00:33.590> kit

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:35.740 
what we got here is a got a treats kit

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:41.020 
what we got here is a got a treats kit
and<00:00:36.740> the<00:00:37.220> streaks<00:00:37.640> kit<00:00:38.030> comes<00:00:38.420> with<00:00:38.600> a<00:00:40.030> coil

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
and the streaks kit comes with a coil

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.000 
and the streaks kit comes with a coil
kit<00:00:42.910> it's<00:00:43.910> like<00:00:44.030> it<00:00:44.180> has<00:00:44.329> a<00:00:44.360> CDI<00:00:44.870> coil<00:00:45.620> and<00:00:45.890> the

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
kit it's like it has a CDI coil and the

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.120 
kit it's like it has a CDI coil and the
wire<00:00:46.220> and<00:00:46.640> stuff<00:00:46.910> you<00:00:47.120> need<00:00:47.300> for<00:00:47.329> that<00:00:48.130> and

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.130 
wire and stuff you need for that and

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.299 
wire and stuff you need for that and
this<00:00:49.579> is<00:00:49.730> extra<00:00:50.239> it's<00:00:50.450> the<00:00:50.540> voltage<00:00:50.960> reg<00:00:51.309> you

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
this is extra it's the voltage reg you

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.810 
this is extra it's the voltage reg you
probably<00:00:52.640> want<00:00:52.850> to<00:00:52.970> get<00:00:53.180> one<00:00:53.450> of<00:00:53.480> these

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
probably want to get one of these

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.549

voltage Wregget Saul ready wired it's

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:03.310 
voltage Wregget Saul ready wired it's
about<00:00:57.770> 13<00:00:58.670> bucks<00:00:58.700> I<00:00:59.270> think<00:00:59.860> but<00:01:00.910> the<00:01:01.910> Polk<00:01:02.320> is

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
about 13 bucks I think but the Polk is

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.430 
about 13 bucks I think but the Polk is
going<00:01:03.710> for<00:01:03.950> them<00:01:04.040> 6<00:01:04.699> volts<00:01:05.059> and<00:01:05.290> once<00:01:06.290> we<00:01:06.409> put

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
going for them 6 volts and once we put

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.390 
going for them 6 volts and once we put

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
always need there for us so anyway

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.969 
always need there for us so anyway
that's<00:01:50.509> the<00:01:50.780> stator<00:01:51.170> plate<00:01:51.439> with<00:01:51.860> the

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
that's the stator plate with the

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.340 
that's the stator plate with the
ignition<00:01:52.220> coil<00:01:52.880> and<00:01:53.299> the<00:01:53.540> lighting<00:01:53.869> coil

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
ignition coil and the lighting coil

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.859 
ignition coil and the lighting coil
there's<00:01:54.680> the<00:01:54.799> matching<00:01:55.250> mag<00:01:55.460> for<00:01:55.850> it<00:01:56.000> and<00:01:56.150> they

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
there's the matching mag for it and they

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:58.719 
there's the matching mag for it and they
have<00:01:57.049> them<00:01:57.259> for<00:01:57.290> the<00:01:57.590> e<00:01:57.619> fifties<00:01:58.189> in<00:01:58.369> the<00:01:58.490> za

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
have them for the e fifties in the za

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.499 
have them for the e fifties in the za
50s<00:01:59.450> and<00:01:59.930> of<00:02:00.020> course<00:02:00.290> I<00:02:00.409> got<00:02:00.560> an<00:02:00.799> 850<00:02:01.460> so<00:02:02.390> the

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
50s and of course I got an 850 so the

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:04.120 
50s and of course I got an 850 so the
part<00:02:02.780> even<00:02:03.049> get<00:02:03.170> a<00:02:03.200> bunch<00:02:03.439> of<00:02:03.500> cool<00:02:03.710> stickers

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
part even get a bunch of cool stickers

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.169 
part even get a bunch of cool stickers
with<00:02:04.310> it<00:02:04.720> but<00:02:05.720> anyway<00:02:06.400> that's<00:02:07.400> part<00:02:07.759> one<00:02:07.939> we'll

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
with it but anyway that's part one we'll

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.639 
with it but anyway that's part one we'll
be<00:02:08.209> getting<00:02:08.539> on<00:02:08.630> a<00:02:08.660> little<00:02:08.989> bit<00:02:09.140> later<00:02:09.319> there

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
be getting on a little bit later there

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:10.930 
be getting on a little bit later there
you<00:02:09.800> know<00:02:09.920> I<00:02:09.950> already<00:02:10.039> got<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.429> cover<00:02:10.670> off<00:02:10.910> the

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
you know I already got the cover off the

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.399 
you know I already got the cover off the
mag

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:12.409 
mag

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:15.100 
mag
just<00:02:12.860> got<00:02:13.010> to<00:02:13.099> pull<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.370> nut<00:02:13.549> off<00:02:14.079> pull<00:02:15.079> the

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
just got to pull the nut off pull the

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.550 
just got to pull the nut off pull the
stator<00:02:15.469> out<00:02:15.739> in<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:15.950> wiring<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:17.170> then<00:02:18.170> we'll

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
stator out in the wiring and then we'll

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.289 
stator out in the wiring and then we'll
see<00:02:18.739> if<00:02:18.769> we<00:02:18.859> get<00:02:19.069> it<00:02:19.189> to<00:02:19.219> fire<00:02:19.519> up<00:02:19.790> because<00:02:20.150> we

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
see if we get it to fire up because we

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:21.729 
see if we get it to fire up because we
got<00:02:20.329> to<00:02:20.540> remount<00:02:20.840> and<00:02:20.989> get<00:02:21.230> a<00:02:21.260> mount<00:02:21.560> the

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
got to remount and get a mount the

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.000 
got to remount and get a mount the
voltage<00:02:22.099> regulator<00:02:22.700> in<00:02:23.239> a<00:02:23.959> coil<00:02:24.230> hopefully

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
voltage regulator in a coil hopefully

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.059 
voltage regulator in a coil hopefully
I'm<00:02:25.129> gonna<00:02:25.310> try<00:02:25.459> to<00:02:25.489> mount<00:02:25.819> it<00:02:26.409> that<00:02:27.409> in<00:02:27.829> this

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
I'm gonna try to mount it that in this

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.550 
I'm gonna try to mount it that in this
area<00:02:28.459> see<00:02:28.760> and<00:02:29.450> hopefully<00:02:30.200> be<00:02:30.319> able<00:02:30.379> to<00:02:30.470> get

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
area see and hopefully be able to get

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.479 
area see and hopefully be able to get
the<00:02:30.709> cover<00:02:30.950> over<00:02:31.129> that<00:02:31.430> too<00:02:31.700> but<00:02:32.030> we'll<00:02:32.420> see

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
the cover over that too but we'll see

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.530 
the cover over that too but we'll see
hopefully<00:02:34.489> by<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:34.849> end<00:02:34.970> of<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.239> day<00:02:35.329> we'll

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
hopefully by the end of the day we'll

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.390 
hopefully by the end of the day we'll
get<00:02:35.659> this<00:02:35.780> baby<00:02:35.959> running<00:02:36.379> and<00:02:36.890> take<00:02:37.129> it<00:02:37.250> for

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
get this baby running and take it for

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.099 
get this baby running and take it for
another<00:02:37.549> spin<00:02:38.090> I<00:02:38.420> guess<00:02:38.569> see<00:02:38.780> if<00:02:38.840> I<00:02:38.900> get<00:02:38.959> some

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:39.109 
another spin I guess see if I get some

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:40.809 
another spin I guess see if I get some
light<00:02:39.409> bulbs<00:02:39.590> because<00:02:39.950> I'll<00:02:40.340> pop<00:02:40.579> them

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
light bulbs because I'll pop them

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.369 
light bulbs because I'll pop them
suckers<00:02:41.120> so<00:02:41.420> I'll<00:02:41.510> probably<00:02:41.719> take<00:02:41.930> those<00:02:42.170> out

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:42.379 
suckers so I'll probably take those out

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:47.049 
suckers so I'll probably take those out
first<00:02:42.969> anyway<00:02:43.969> talk<00:02:44.720> to<00:02:44.840> you<00:02:44.900> later
