00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
because you know the deck is very good i

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.180 
because you know the deck is very good i
think<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.850> still<00:00:39.090> has<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.270> chance<00:00:39.600> being

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
think it still has a chance being

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.819 
think it still has a chance being
competitive<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:42.079> i'm<00:00:43.079> very<00:00:43.140> familiar<00:00:43.500> with

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
competitive and i'm very familiar with

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.979 
competitive and i'm very familiar with
the<00:00:44.040> day<00:00:44.190> so<00:00:44.489> obviously<00:00:45.090> less<00:00:45.360> likely<00:00:45.840> of

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
the day so obviously less likely of

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.520 
the day so obviously less likely of
their<00:00:46.170> their<00:00:47.100> chance<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.670> me<00:00:48.090> miss<00:00:48.270> plane<00:00:48.539> okay

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
their their chance of me miss plane okay

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.439
