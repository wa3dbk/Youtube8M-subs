00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:21.910
 and here we are 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:37.600
 how to make a 3d glasses for your brand 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:37.600
 with very simple things and materials 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.320
 in 10 pesos accelerate 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.860
 What is needed are the red and 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:53.360
 black blue to mark what they are going to 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.360
 cut a pair of scissors 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.680
 but be careful with the sharp elbows 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.710
 they went to that stage 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.080
 what we have to do is take away a 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.610
 lens 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:10.200
 to mark it here in the light the smoke 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.979
 black 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.979
 your brand 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:23.140
 on the acetate sheet another pitcher level 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.700
 they did not win their dad's glasses 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.700
 because he's going to break his kill and 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.380
 villains raised by pigs loses 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.929
 It helps him that my street was worth it 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.789
 peanut and that the frame lives there 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:35.789
 in ecuador since it is marked 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.290
 and be careful because then also all 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.450
 they saw what happened little things are a 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.450
 cost of 12 thousand 500 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.410
 that yes the lenses are not of the highest 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.360
 quality of the world do not believe that they are going to 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.050
 have super chivas but in half if 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.050
 come 3d 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.260
 to take the 3d now if you 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.780
 computer is very slow maybe not 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.270
 he runs them also be careful but 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.550
 Sorry to try it, it's already cut 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.940
 in worked it is about in the form of 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.940
 lens 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:31.090
 we have to paint one red and one blue 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.159
 Be careful not to do this because 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.920
 the lenses of the 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:38.110
 centers what we want is for the 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.879
 spaces also for all the acetate 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.879
 so that the spots do not remain 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.360
 or 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.970
 and so they are going to paint the blue side and then 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.980
 they are going to paint the red side 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.010
 and with this you will see the colors that 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:59.420
 are occupied to access in 3-d are the 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.420
 remind you of homemade lenses 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.930
 and try them to see if it works 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.000
 they gave me flying and flying is not 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:13.040
 edited we still have little time 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.040
 recorded and we almost finished good 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.070
 Y 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.560
 the red and the blue with little things now 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.650
 let's take the other lens off 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.530
 lenses 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.680
 we're going to put the blue going on the side 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.680
 straight 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.400
 I do not know what is happening to me 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.099
 and the red 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.580
 yes 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:05.550
 or more exactly for example 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.020
 we simply want 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:24.360
 and that 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:26.189
 how he came back to the antro appreciate good 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.699
 already with this can play minecraft 

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:31.190
 dentrÃ­fica file you see what's here 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:36.010
 where the number of light 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.010
 It is a 'crack' 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:42.230
 but I forgot to put band as 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:48.020
 Chinese was activated the 3d look at them I'm going to 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:49.580
 teaching to see this map is because they 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.250
 we teach to make the lenses but not what 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.510
 we started to activate three of this map's bitch 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.880
 is the one that has long since lost that 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.410
 I'm with what I'm doing but 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.510
 well look at the 3d is activated from the 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.580
 next way they put you skype 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.970
 after the skate they put options then 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:08.480
 of options here in video options 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:10.640
 then here where 3d anaglyph says 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:14.150
 to clive or I do not know when they put you here 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:16.190
 puts you in where done new or done 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.410
 box and they have it in Spanish and that's it 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.510
 made voice in 3d and obviously with the 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:23.030
 lenses give a minute of the lenses 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:25.760
 so they get used to how it looks 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:28.070
 it does not look better than the normal game 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.710
 because the colors look weird but if 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:32.030
 you see three of them and they will like it 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.590
 well we see it for a little while so it 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.720
 have fun is cool 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.249
 there is the same to disable skate 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:41.869
 options videos 

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:42.830
 and three of aquino off off and already where I've 

00:05:41.869 --> 00:05:47.470
