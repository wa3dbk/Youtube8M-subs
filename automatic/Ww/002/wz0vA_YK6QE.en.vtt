00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 licit and infraction to the drug law 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.590
 they look like flesh and blood but they are 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.790
 simulators of the human being were 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.230
 brought by the university of the 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.930
 americas so that the students of the 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.430
 careers linked to medicine 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:17.840
 practice before you start your stage 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.840
 clinic with real patients 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.810
 they breathe then and they even complain about their 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.870
 look like anyone's 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.730
 but they are not are simulators matÃ­as 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.070
 that replicate various behaviors 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.630
 of the human being they will allow the 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.250
 students of the different races of the 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.230
 Health of the University of the Americas 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.050
 recreate crisis situations like 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.250
 heart attacks or surgeries 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.290
 usually the student learns in the 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.210
 theory and then goes to the clinical field 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.750
 we want with this step 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:52.600
 intermediate that the student learns before 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.130
 to enter your clinical practice a 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.050
 Patient simulator has 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.790
 spontaneous breathing track control 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.740
 air and blood pressure that 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.660
 combine at the same time with practice 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.820
 of a sick person under real conditions 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.710
 therefore everyone has his clue 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.170
 clinic where your data is detailed 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.820
 personal the pathology that he has and 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.280
 what procedures are to be 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.410
 they apply what goes from surgeries to 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.310
 what might seem simpler a 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.020
 blood sample 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.020
 in this case the simulation of the 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.369
 granular and I see on the monitor that the 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.329
 bevel has to be up and 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.329
 When I'm sure 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.840
 introduction 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.790
 there are cameras connected to the pavilion 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.799
 surgical where what will be recorded 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.840
 there it happens to see if the student's reader 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.460
 has been adequate since they could even 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.950
 face the death of one of his 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:43.250
 patients in the teachers questions 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.460
 they are checking if one had some 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.740
 complications are correcting van 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.600
 reading everything but this is not all because 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.850
 thanks to the collaboration of teachers 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.009
 psychologists and students of the career of 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.440
 performance simulations will be developed 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.060
 quite real situations to 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.560
 which they will face in their life 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.940
 professional they do not only do 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.800
 dramatizations and accidents 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.320
 but also of behaviors and they 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.260
 they will also see patients in a duel 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.970
 how are they going to solve problems this 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.739
 center that involved an investment of more 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.810
 of a million dollars is the most 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.880
 modern of South America and pretend with 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.430
 this advanced technology that future 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.290
 graduates learn from their mistakes 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:28.180
 mistakes that you could not make when trying 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.180
 with meat and bone patients
