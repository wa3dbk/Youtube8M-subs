00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
to make this work is because I have x40

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.700 
to make this work is because I have x40
ones<00:02:09.100> you<00:02:09.610> need<00:02:09.940> to<00:02:10.140> turn<00:02:11.140> this<00:02:11.470> little

ones you need to turn this little
clothing<00:02:12.430> on<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.650> then<00:02:14.650> you<00:02:14.830> could<00:02:14.980> record

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
clothing on and then you could record

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.500 
clothing on and then you could record
sounds<00:02:16.600> with<00:02:17.560> that<00:02:17.770> before<00:02:18.460> you<00:02:18.700> use<00:02:18.970> it<00:02:19.000> to

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
sounds with that before you use it to

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.600 
sounds with that before you use it to
relay<00:02:19.960> sound<00:02:20.320> and<00:02:20.560> that's<00:02:21.160> all<00:02:21.340> you<00:02:21.430> have<00:02:21.520> to

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
relay sound and that's all you have to

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.250 
relay sound and that's all you have to
do<00:02:21.760> and<00:02:22.180> I'm<00:02:22.390> pretty<00:02:22.630> sure<00:02:22.870> this<00:02:23.050> will<00:02:23.200> work

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260

with all turtle beach's hopefully but I

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.680 
with all turtle beach's hopefully but I
know<00:02:28.510> for<00:02:28.870> sure<00:02:28.900> works<00:02:29.290> with<00:02:29.470> x40<00:02:30.130> ones<00:02:30.310> and
