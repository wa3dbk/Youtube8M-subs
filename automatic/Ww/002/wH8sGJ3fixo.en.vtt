the<00:00:23.220> side<00:00:23.430> controls<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.180> gimbal<00:00:24.539> which<00:00:24.720> is

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
the side controls the gimbal which is

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.259 
the side controls the gimbal which is
the<00:00:24.990> camera<00:00:25.350> up<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.680> down<00:00:25.910> but<00:00:26.910> people<00:00:27.210> have

because<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:34.110> wanted<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:35.390> wanted<00:00:36.390> to

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
because I wanted to wanted to

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.940 
because I wanted to wanted to
demonstrate<00:00:36.719> this<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.320> can<00:00:37.440> see<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.770> app

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
demonstrate this you can see the app

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.569 
demonstrate this you can see the app
really<00:00:38.879> real<00:00:39.210> clearly<00:00:39.719> within<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.079> video<00:00:40.579> but

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
really real clearly within the video but

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.310 
really real clearly within the video but
as<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:41.850> mentioned<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.390> one<00:00:42.540> on<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.809> left<00:00:43.079> side

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
as I mentioned the one on the left side

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.920 
as I mentioned the one on the left side
the<00:00:43.620> gimbal<00:00:43.890> will<00:00:44.040> on<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.280> left<00:00:44.750> it's<00:00:45.750> going

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
the gimbal will on the left it's going

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.360 
the gimbal will on the left it's going
to<00:00:45.989> control<00:00:46.260> your<00:00:46.379> camera<00:00:46.800> up<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.070> down<00:00:47.190> and

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
to control your camera up and down and

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.650 
to control your camera up and down and
you<00:00:47.430> can<00:00:47.579> see<00:00:47.760> how<00:00:47.910> smooth<00:00:48.530> down<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:50.010> then<00:00:50.129> up

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
you can see how smooth down and then up

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.869 
you can see how smooth down and then up
that<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:51.870> how<00:00:52.110> slow<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.649> smooth<00:00:52.890> that's

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
that is how slow and smooth that's

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.760 
that is how slow and smooth that's
because<00:00:54.210> I've<00:00:54.390> customized<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.260> gimbal<00:00:55.590> wheel

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
because I've customized the gimbal wheel

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.180 
because I've customized the gimbal wheel
speed<00:00:56.750> to<00:00:57.750> be<00:00:57.870> optimal<00:00:58.379> for<00:00:58.410> video<00:00:58.829> because

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
speed to be optimal for video because

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.389 
speed to be optimal for video because
for<00:00:59.399> video<00:01:00.050> you<00:01:01.050> want<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.260> have<00:01:01.379> very<00:01:01.649> slow<00:01:02.129> and

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
for video you want to have very slow and

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.000 
for video you want to have very slow and
controlled<00:01:03.439> movements<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.559> just<00:01:04.739> makes<00:01:04.920> a

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
controlled movements it just makes a

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.580 
controlled movements it just makes a
video<00:01:05.129> more<00:01:05.519> watchable<00:01:06.260> now<00:01:07.260> what<00:01:07.470> does<00:01:07.530> this

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
video more watchable now what does this

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.100 
video more watchable now what does this
one<00:01:07.830> on<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.040> right<00:01:08.220> dude<00:01:08.900> okay<00:01:09.900> well<00:01:10.049> I'm

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
one on the right dude okay well I'm

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.750 
one on the right dude okay well I'm
about<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.530> use<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.920> now<00:01:11.100> watch<00:01:11.310> see<00:01:11.580> where<00:01:11.700> it

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
about to use it now watch see where it

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.080 
about to use it now watch see where it
says<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:12.330> oh<00:01:12.650> these<00:01:13.650> are<00:01:13.830> camera<00:01:14.189> settings<00:01:14.610> out

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
says is oh these are camera settings out

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.880 
says is oh these are camera settings out
there<00:01:15.240> towards<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.600> top<00:01:15.810> where<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.049> says<00:01:16.140> safe

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
there towards the top where it says safe

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.030 
there towards the top where it says safe
to<00:01:17.040> fly<00:01:17.189> GPS<00:01:18.259> and<00:01:19.259> then<00:01:19.350> underneath<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.830> Scott

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
to fly GPS and then underneath the Scott

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.230 
to fly GPS and then underneath the Scott
Gaia<00:01:20.250> so<00:01:20.520> if<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:20.759> do<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:21.119> will<00:01:23.000> okay<00:01:24.000> it's<00:01:24.119> at

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
Gaia so if I do this will okay it's at

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.350 
Gaia so if I do this will okay it's at
the<00:01:24.360> max<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.869> oh<00:01:25.170> now<00:01:25.409> see<00:01:25.590> it's<00:01:25.710> going<00:01:25.979> down

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
the max is oh now see it's going down

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.969 
the max is oh now see it's going down
1600<00:01:27.360> ISO<00:01:27.780> 800<00:01:30.020> so<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.140> controls<00:01:31.500> your<00:01:31.619> camera

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
1600 ISO 800 so it controls your camera

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.999 
1600 ISO 800 so it controls your camera
settings<00:01:32.009> see<00:01:32.430> how<00:01:32.490> much<00:01:32.670> darker<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:33.270> got

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
settings see how much darker that got

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.859 
settings see how much darker that got
now<00:01:35.009> see<00:01:35.189> if<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.400> go<00:01:35.579> up<00:01:35.610> if<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.540> go<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.840> other

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
now see if I go up if I go the other

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.289 
now see if I go up if I go the other
direction<00:01:37.170> with<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.770> scroll<00:01:38.040> wheel<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:39.119> see

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
direction with that scroll wheel you see

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.100 
direction with that scroll wheel you see
the<00:01:39.420> iso's<00:01:40.049> increasing<00:01:41.479> the<00:01:42.479> brightness<00:01:42.930> is

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
the iso's increasing the brightness is

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.679 
the iso's increasing the brightness is
increasing<00:01:43.880> and<00:01:44.880> again<00:01:45.210> if<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.390> go<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.659> other

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
increasing and again if I go the other

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.109 
increasing and again if I go the other
way<00:01:46.070> it's<00:01:47.070> going<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.250> start<00:01:47.490> going<00:01:47.670> down<00:01:47.939> it's

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
way it's going to start going down it's

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.030 
way it's going to start going down it's
going<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.299> get<00:01:48.420> darker<00:01:51.110> so<00:01:52.110> just<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.500> quick<00:01:52.710> way

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
going to get darker so just a quick way

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.889 
going to get darker so just a quick way
to<00:01:54.079> to<00:01:55.079> manipulate<00:01:56.009> your<00:01:56.450> your<00:01:57.450> camera

settings depending upon the the
environment<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:01.439> you'll<00:02:01.680> be<00:02:01.829> filming<00:02:02.579> in<00:02:02.790> so

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
environment that you'll be filming in so

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.200 
environment that you'll be filming in so
