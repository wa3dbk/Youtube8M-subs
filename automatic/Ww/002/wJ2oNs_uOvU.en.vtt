00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 1 

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.029
 yyuu everyone knew how to retreat 

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:06.500
 we look for a brand new 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:07.729
 video and it's going to the third time 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.059
 I'm doing this fucking videos again 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:13.490
 because my dogs yell after twelve 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.860
 dogs here it is haiti I can not 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.119
 change a lot and so good 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.860
 find for the fourth episode of 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.810
 my new series finally the new 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.759
 series my series the section resale purchase 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.220
 so in this episode we will talk 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:27.919
 players posted modified so we're going 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.800
 start right away i 'll get you 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:32.210
 introduce a player who can walk 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.620
 all the gap with me that walked I 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.059
 I'm done a little bit of 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:40.249
 profits on it I'm enough 4005 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.289
 5000 beneff on a single player that's 

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:45.320
 a fabregas and you take a baby by 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:46.370
 example so that's the purpose of an intruder 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.719
 that appear modified for example 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.159
 sturridge and a baby you take it in 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.219
 emotions and there will not be many 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:54.379
 normand so there 15000 is not good 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.749
 it's not very very good and you take 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.260
 really if there are 1 3000 underneath 

00:00:56.749 --> 00:01:00.379
 of the average 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.780
 there are not really any good deals to 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.040
 do there is one and fifteen thousand but good 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.950
 he added 16 miles 5 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:12.080
 so that's really nothing we're going to go 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:13.460
 see sturridge my friend sturridge in 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.630
 foam and see what that actually gives 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.130
 the goal is to take players who 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.490
 say that you see quite often on 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.990
 the market so for example of diego 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.810
 costa and everything and you take them in a 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.560
 post is changed so there is no 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.560
 really good business 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:36.660
 but you will see that in my list 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:37.530
 of wines or what maybe the 5005 can 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.730
 maybe do something on it 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.110
 their 26000 2003 that's what you 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.240
 will not hear too much my dogs yelling 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.450
 because finally it's really very very 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.760
 boring light maybe take me that 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.570
 depends on the neighborhood name again there are 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.730
 many cards have one to four 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.350
 hours it 's not going to do it so it's in 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:03.870
 full of players like that for example 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:05.850
 you have costa divo costa to you from 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.890
 look to blunt benteke it can 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.140
 also walk there are plenty of players 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.010
 like that that works 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.790
 she does not really have any good deals 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:16.380
 still balotelli too once I 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.750
 managed to sell them at the same time not two 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.760
 minutes on Thursday just me I had them 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.400
 put 3000 more 3 I had bought 3 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.680
 and I put 3,000 more I 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.510
 had bought 15 friends 18000 they are 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.570
 left two minutes later and I had 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.370
 finally quite shocked anyway so here the 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.640
 sphere that you can do if the voc 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:39.989
 all we are at ten thousand do not have much 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.370
 underneath in anything really does not have and 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.450
 no to seven minutes and ben you buy 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:53.410
 what there is here you buy 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:57.210
 that one 6000 quest up before our 6000 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:00.310
 not be afraid of losing credits 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:04.090
 at worst you lose the person 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.430
 will buy it and so here there by bah 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:10.330
 example you bought two 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:12.070
 waiters yy and stop paying that that's 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.090
 typically the servers right now 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.000
 it's anything 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:19.060
 it was fifa ultimate team 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.070
 do not answer where is it going to put something like 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.230
 I'm used to it now ah bah no 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.300
 not even a job and for example I 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.400
 bought 6000 I saw that the most 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.900
 dear who had after that was 7005 and ben 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.030
 I'm going to put them at 7000 3 just in 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.600
 below and it's not too much to put the same 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:37.540
 price or not and that's to allow the 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:40.110
 same prices eg for not here 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.220
 that it makes too much of a monopoly 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.990
 otherwise, from that moment 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.300
 people they will see and they will suspect each other 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.440
 of something but good because there will be 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.660
 they will not have much choice they 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.150
 will have to take this is there so I'm going 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:56.140
 show you another player who walks 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.910
 really well it's oscar so oscars in 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.810
 bus that works great there I'm in 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.950
 doing a fucking business 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.390
 because there are not many at all 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.600
 wait i'll show you that all of 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.170
 after 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:10.330
 there I take them to 5000 mac I believe and 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:12.720
 I will show you that to the Oscars 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.720
 there is 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.750
 blunder 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.979
 go for nothing and do not like 

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:22.939
 if there were not there, that's it 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:25.580
 there really is not much about 

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:29.960
 market and the other cheaper than 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:32.509
 do it oh my god this is the 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.699
 do against against the world 3009 a 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:36.650
 Oscar 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:38.870
 shocked the while all the others they 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.580
 were five miles away and so like you 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.669
 can see the cheapest that remains is 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:48.220
 at 9500 immediate purchase price and so 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:51.100
 what I take at 5920 resell them 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.110
 8005 here and it's going to make a fucking 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:57.010
 besides, I'll put them 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:05:00.060
 directly with you all if I get to 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:03.430
 the sell I make myself a damn good 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.600
 we're going to do something that works 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.900
 because people believe that they are going 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.190
 to make a good deal so 8008 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.420
 doctor who say to themselves ah yeah he has 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.050
 left 500 maybe it's a 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.180
 mistake on his part 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.320
 and so they will bid either mixed 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.140
 in fact ben no you did not do 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.310
 of error at all so that's 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.720
 technically really with people who 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.920
 not too familiar with the market of 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.540
 people who want to make a team 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:26.020
 hybrid for example and who want a 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:27.550
 Brazilian scorer dpl in front for power 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.930
 to make a link with another Brazilian 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.070
 is all 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.190
 that's why this technique works 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.420
 otherwise it would not work I think but 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.030
 good I can tell you what margins 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:42.700
 hate and walk we'll do what in 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:44.190
 2003 here is the other I put it to 8005 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:47.980
 1007 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:49.330
 we'll see if his part and I'll go 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.110
 present another technique after which 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.300
 walking 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:55.150
 finally I'm going to turn the next 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:57.100
 episode right after that there because 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:01.150
 I tested this technique also that 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:06.280
 walked on the 12th on the 13th and that 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:10.870
 I had not try again on the on the 14 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:13.420
 so here I hope that this video you 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.790
 will have pleased there are two players who walk 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.350

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.060
 bossed jovetic emarge on the foam 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:21.400

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.050
 I made the purchase resale on me 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.900
 will buy 14 muzzle rendering 16000 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:27.510

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.500
 from beneff 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:31.240

 price that others and 1004 here and that 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.410
 are not going to worry so there 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:46.990
