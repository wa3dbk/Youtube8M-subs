 nervous because they will be true if that is 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.730
 something that gives me truth has me nervous 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.100
 because it's a live show but I have 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.100
 faith I'm next to a big one that is 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:32.219
 training and well let's say I've already 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.960
 faced large masses live but not 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.180
 on television but good at 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.890
 concerts at events and it's a challenge 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.270
 but it's always important just 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.010
 who is at your side and is 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.840

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.840
 get well program everything ok 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:52.020
 but be careful that I am not the teacher 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.930
 and the teacher and all the pressure I feel 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.280
 pressed is not enough of lovely we go

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.830
 is going to carry all the weight and that 's it and 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.450

 see them there to all people to everything 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.630
 because I tell you the first program 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.830
 it is not allusion the program is a program 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.780
 that should not be lost because it's going to 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.640
 have many surprises and especially that 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.960
 presentation program we are going to present 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.520
 to all our collaborators all 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.640
 our team everything that is going to move 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:32.210
 out there and we have so much material that 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.210
 to the next week 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.670
 all terrain that will see me now 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.230
 I'm a bit limited because you have 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.470
 these places where I will not be able to go 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:49.710
 but already and they are going to see we have 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:52.710
 and 30 and this surprise thinks and obviously 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:55.310
 as you comment, you are in a 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:58.410
 different stage but maybe now 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.690
 you miss the stages a bit 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.330
 do shows you plan to go back or you've already 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.910
 changed stage now mom a program in 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.730
 television and something more quiet look at the 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:12.060
 truth I'll be honest sometimes and 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.820
 strange strange but in the energy of the 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.730
 people that will be I will select the people 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:20.040
 shout and sing your songs and power 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.660
 share that joy with them but 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.480
 I think the opportunity to be in the 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.820
 tele is going to win me that little one has been 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.040
 that I have stayed because I miss the 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.570
 people strange to the public and good 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.610
 opportunity I think it's going to fill that 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.610
 space but I'm living a stage 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.529
 as beautiful as motherhood 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.509
 true 

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:40.249
 another thing for me is something 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:42.559
 wonderful perhaps the program also 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:45.919
 I could encourage you to give us tips for 

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:48.829
 ships like you definitely that's 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:51.199
 included and we are going to have tips and 

00:04:48.829 --> 00:04:53.449
 I will also tell you a little about giving 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:55.039
 some little secrets that we can eat what 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:57.559
 exercises we can do because I follow 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:59.659
 doing sport there are also moms 

00:04:57.559 --> 00:05:03.249
 prepare yourself because you give them all the tips 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:03.249

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:12.949
 man in the morning we will be without a doubt 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:15.099
 a new success here sees the clear life that 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:15.099
 yes
