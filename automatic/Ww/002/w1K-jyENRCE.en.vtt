00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
now it's not because that's from the

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.640 
now it's not because that's from the
other<00:01:17.610> game<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.600> sh<00:01:18.930> G<00:01:19.170> stands<00:01:19.500> for

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
other game the sh G stands for

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.249 
other game the sh G stands for
sledgehammer<00:01:20.430> gaming<00:01:20.970> but<00:01:21.900> here's<00:01:22.080> what

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
sledgehammer gaming but here's what

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.640 
sledgehammer gaming but here's what
something<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.590> looks<00:01:22.890> like<00:01:23.070> another<00:01:24.650> Easter

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
something that looks like another Easter

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.130 
something that looks like another Easter
Egg<00:01:25.850> another<00:01:26.850> zombie<00:01:27.180> reference<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.869> actually

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
Egg another zombie reference it actually

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.719 
Egg another zombie reference it actually
looks<00:01:28.320> like<00:01:28.380> but<00:01:28.710> again<00:01:28.770> it's<00:01:29.100> Infinity<00:01:29.549> Ward

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
looks like but again it's Infinity Ward

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.700 
looks like but again it's Infinity Ward
so<00:01:29.880> it's<00:01:30.000> not<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.180> zombie<00:01:30.360> reference<00:01:30.869> but<00:01:31.110> right

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
so it's not a zombie reference but right

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.770 
so it's not a zombie reference but right
here<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.979> says<00:01:32.159> beware<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.670> bad<00:01:33.090> dogs

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
here it says beware of bad dogs

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.090 
here it says beware of bad dogs
so<00:01:34.400> that's<00:01:35.400> just<00:01:35.520> kind<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.759> interesting<00:01:36.270> but

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
so that's just kind of interesting but

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.620 
so that's just kind of interesting but
like<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.250> said<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.700> looks<00:01:38.939> like<00:01:39.000> Samantha<00:01:39.509> but

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
like I said it looks like Samantha but

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.870 
like I said it looks like Samantha but
