 Lipid, lipid I like you Structure, energy, insulation for baby 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.000
 Because lipid, lipid I like you But in my belly I do not want to see you anymore 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.000
 Omega-3 polyunsaturated long chain is good fat, badly has nothing 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.000
 There are two types of cholesterols One does good and the other one bad for us 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.000
 If you do not take care you can end up in death Are lipoproteins that work in transport 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.000
 LDL goes from the liver to the tissues With HDL the crystals are removed 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.000
 Cholesterol is a precursor agent of testosterone which is a hormone inducer 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.000
 Of sphingolipids we do not forget not They take nitrogen into the constitution 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:11.000

 Because lipid, lipid I like you But in my belly I do not want to see you anymore 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.000
 Phospholipids are compound lipids. In the bilayer, they become willing 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.000
 In digestion has the bile salts are molecules that exist in the thousands 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.000
 There is also mechanical protection Each has its organic function 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.000
 Energy reserve it guarantees Are anti-oxidants 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.000
 Chylomicrons who does is the gut The circulation is leading to its destination 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.000
 Fatty acid and glycerol melt It is the process of esterification 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:11.000

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.000
 Biosynthesis happens yes In mammary glands, adipocytes and kidney 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.000
 It has inhibited pathways, keeps in memory Krebs cycle and respiratory chain 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.000
 The activator is the ACP group It's in the cytosol that this is going to happen 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.000
 The reducing agent is NADPH Synthesis begins with Acetyl-COA 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.000
 Beware of how much carbohydrate you eat At high rate it turns fat that is fact 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.000
 Protein also turns into lipid Stored as triglyceride 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:11.000

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.000
 Fatty acids are metabolized In mitochondria is where they are broken 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.000
 In adipocytes the hydrolysis happens sensitive lipase, highlight it deserves 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.000
 Glucagon, adrenaline, T3 and GH Lipolytic action, fat will burn 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.000
 Coenzyme A is activating molecule Whose vitamin B is the forming substance 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.000
 In the Linen cycle is where they will stop For Acetyl-COA to form 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.000
 This cycle has a hydration AND two oxidation reactions 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 ...

 We have lipid as oil and fat Oil in tomato, x-everything is fry 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:41.000
 They fulfill the structural function In the animal, bacterial and plant cell 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.000
 Fat is an energy reserve Its accumulation depends on genetics 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:53.000
 It also works as a thermal insulation. They stay well beneath dermal tissue 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:59.000
 Lipids are very important molecules Some of them are waterproofing 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.000
 Than water they are less dense Fatty acids are always quite extensive 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:17.000

 Degradation in excess has another fuel With ketone bodies transport is possible 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:41.000
 For they are compounds that mix with water. And so, in fasting, organisms last 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:47.000
 Unsaturates are not good suppliers because they generate less reducing equivalents 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:53.000
 In the circulation who transports is albumin. Within the membrane, who carries is carnitine 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:59.000
