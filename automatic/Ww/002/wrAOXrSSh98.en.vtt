interest<00:01:27.710> of<00:01:27.920> those<00:01:28.370> contributions<00:01:29.530> the<00:01:30.530> idea

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
interest of those contributions the idea

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.360 
interest of those contributions the idea
is<00:01:31.070> that<00:01:31.870> we<00:01:32.870> start<00:01:33.200> to<00:01:33.350> listen<00:01:33.740> to<00:01:34.130> the<00:01:34.250> music

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
is that we start to listen to the music

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.180 
is that we start to listen to the music
in<00:01:34.730> a<00:01:34.820> different<00:01:35.180> way<00:01:35.360> because<00:01:35.930> we<00:01:36.140> see<00:01:36.920> things

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
in a different way because we see things

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.270 
in a different way because we see things
that<00:01:37.400> are<00:01:37.760> associated<00:01:38.450> with<00:01:38.870> it<00:01:39.110> it's<00:01:40.040> like

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
that are associated with it it's like

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
that are associated with it it's like
creating<00:01:41.090> another<00:01:41.390> another<00:01:42.170> world<00:01:42.970> with<00:01:43.970> and

different interpretation I just hope

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.770 
different interpretation I just hope
that<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.740> people<00:02:40.920> will<00:02:41.580> listen<00:02:42.240> to<00:02:42.570> the<00:02:42.690> music

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
that the people will listen to the music

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.720 
that the people will listen to the music
in<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.320> different<00:02:43.680> way<00:02:43.860> because<00:02:44.040> they<00:02:44.340> see

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
in a different way because they see

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.750 
in a different way because they see
something<00:02:45.209> they<00:02:45.630> can't<00:02:45.660> dream<00:02:46.500> away<00:02:46.830> or<00:02:47.190> get

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
something they can't dream away or get

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.570 
something they can't dream away or get
associations<00:02:48.600> or<00:02:48.830> hear<00:02:49.830> the<00:02:50.010> music<00:02:50.370> in<00:02:50.489> a
