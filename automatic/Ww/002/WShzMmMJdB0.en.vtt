boredom with industry trends I tend to

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.529 
boredom with industry trends I tend to
gravitate<00:00:25.769> toward<00:00:26.369> video<00:00:26.699> games<00:00:27.029> with

gravitate toward video games with

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.500 
gravitate toward video games with
artistic<00:00:28.320> ambition<00:00:28.980> whether<00:00:29.580> that<00:00:29.789> ambition

artistic ambition whether that ambition

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.690 
artistic ambition whether that ambition
succeeds<00:00:31.050> or<00:00:31.230> not<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:32.070> course<00:00:32.309> an<00:00:32.550> issue

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
succeeds or not is of course an issue

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.540 
succeeds or not is of course an issue
but<00:00:33.329> if<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.540> game<00:00:33.780> is<00:00:33.809> at<00:00:34.320> least<00:00:34.559> trying<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.399> do

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
but if a game is at least trying to do

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.459 
but if a game is at least trying to do
something<00:00:35.820> different<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.809> create<00:00:37.140> some

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
something different to create some

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.340 
something different to create some
unique<00:00:37.770> aesthetic<00:00:38.640> experience<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.780> at<00:00:40.200> least

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
unique aesthetic experience it at least

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.729 
unique aesthetic experience it at least
gets<00:00:40.770> my<00:00:40.980> attention<00:00:41.129> if<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:42.180> want<00:00:42.390> realism<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:43.260> go

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
gets my attention if I want realism I go

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.590 
gets my attention if I want realism I go
outside<00:00:43.890> outside<00:00:44.550> does<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.300> lot<00:00:45.450> better

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
outside outside does it a lot better

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.290 
outside outside does it a lot better
than<00:00:45.899> video<00:00:46.110> games<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.920> besides<00:00:47.250> why<00:00:47.879> strive

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
than video games and besides why strive

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.619 
than video games and besides why strive
for<00:00:48.629> realistic<00:00:49.559> facial<00:00:50.100> animations<00:00:51.000> when

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
for realistic facial animations when

00:00:51.629 --> 00:01:01.430 
for realistic facial animations when
you're<00:00:51.780> free<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.199> create<00:00:52.469> things<00:00:53.340> like<00:00:53.789> this

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.829 

and<00:01:02.440> I<00:01:02.650> guess<00:01:02.830> this<00:01:03.340> is<00:01:03.670> actually<00:01:04.360> the<00:01:04.480> easiest

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
and I guess this is actually the easiest

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.790 
and I guess this is actually the easiest
way<00:01:05.110> to<00:01:05.170> reference<00:01:05.740> this<00:01:06.430> it's<00:01:07.180> a<00:01:07.330> nice

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
way to reference this it's a nice

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.260 
way to reference this it's a nice
ambiguous<00:01:08.800> pronoun<00:01:09.460> that<00:01:09.700> provides<00:01:10.060> no

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
ambiguous pronoun that provides no

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.590 
ambiguous pronoun that provides no
connotation<00:01:10.690> and<00:01:11.290> allows<00:01:12.190> this<00:01:12.640> to<00:01:13.060> explain

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
connotation and allows this to explain

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.410 
connotation and allows this to explain
itself<00:01:14.020> on<00:01:14.350> its<00:01:14.410> own<00:01:14.920> terms<00:01:15.220> but<00:01:15.970> for<00:01:16.360> the

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
itself on its own terms but for the

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.740 
itself on its own terms but for the
purposes<00:01:16.930> of<00:01:16.990> you<00:01:17.740> know<00:01:17.890> game<00:01:18.220> review<00:01:18.700> I<00:01:18.910> guess

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
purposes of you know game review I guess

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.370 
purposes of you know game review I guess
this<00:01:20.050> is<00:01:20.260> like<00:01:20.440> pac-man<00:01:20.970> only<00:01:21.970> in<00:01:22.420> Wallace

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
this is like pac-man only in Wallace

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.460 
this is like pac-man only in Wallace
mazes<00:01:23.979> that<00:01:24.280> spin<00:01:24.790> and<00:01:25.090> if<00:01:25.750> you<00:01:26.170> know<00:01:26.260> when

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
mazes that spin and if you know when

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.550 
mazes that spin and if you know when
finish<00:01:26.950> pac-man<00:01:27.760> ate<00:01:28.000> them<00:01:28.360> of<00:01:28.630> course<00:01:29.410> we

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
finish pac-man ate them of course we

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.560 
finish pac-man ate them of course we
can't<00:01:29.800> very<00:01:30.010> well<00:01:30.070> spend<00:01:30.580> an<00:01:30.760> entire<00:01:30.910> review

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570

can't very well spend an entire review
using<00:01:32.140> just<00:01:32.619> pronouns<00:01:33.220> so<00:01:33.670> this<00:01:33.790> is<00:01:33.820> actually
