00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
cerebral move he's not playing that wide

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.050

big<00:01:44.810> hook<00:01:45.110> as<00:01:45.350> his<00:01:45.890> opponent<00:01:46.340> Alan<00:01:46.580> Bishop<00:01:46.910> is

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
big hook as his opponent Alan Bishop is

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.520 
big hook as his opponent Alan Bishop is
doing<00:01:47.360> and<00:01:47.480> this<00:01:47.570> is<00:01:47.720> really<00:01:47.900> the<00:01:48.110> right<00:01:48.260> move

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
doing and this is really the right move

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.830 
doing and this is really the right move
a<00:01:48.830> very<00:01:49.340> experienced<00:01:49.970> move<00:01:50.150> and<00:01:50.360> I<00:01:50.450> believe

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
a very experienced move and I believe

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.240 
a very experienced move and I believe
his<00:01:51.050> brother<00:01:51.320> must<00:01:51.590> have<00:01:51.740> said<00:01:51.890> something<00:01:51.920> to
