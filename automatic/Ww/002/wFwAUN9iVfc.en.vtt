00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:22.110 

all<00:01:14.080> other<00:01:14.380> stuff<00:01:15.570> okay<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:18.520> found<00:01:19.000> one<00:01:21.120> right

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.120 
all other stuff okay I found one right

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.610 
all other stuff okay I found one right
I'm<00:01:22.750> guessing<00:01:24.810> they<00:01:25.810> have<00:01:25.960> to<00:01:26.050> design<00:01:26.350> on<00:01:26.530> this

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620 
I'm guessing they have to design on this

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.710 
I'm guessing they have to design on this
side<00:01:26.860> right<00:01:26.890> I<00:01:27.370> think<00:01:27.880> that's<00:01:28.270> the<00:01:28.360> right<00:01:28.540> way

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
side right I think that's the right way

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.710 
side right I think that's the right way
up<00:01:28.840> if<00:01:29.050> not<00:01:29.200> it's<00:01:29.410> this<00:01:29.590> way<00:01:29.850> but<00:01:30.850> there<00:01:31.570> you<00:01:31.660> go

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
up if not it's this way but there you go

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.280 
up if not it's this way but there you go
so<00:01:32.590> let's<00:01:32.910> open<00:01:33.910> it<00:01:33.970> up<00:01:34.090> and<00:01:34.270> see<00:01:34.540> what<00:01:35.020> it<00:01:35.050> is

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
so let's open it up and see what it is
