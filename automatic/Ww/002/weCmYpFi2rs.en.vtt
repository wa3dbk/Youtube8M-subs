for<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.930> interview<00:00:22.170> or<00:00:22.470> anything<00:00:22.500> I

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
for the the interview or anything I

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:25.880 
for the the interview or anything I
think<00:00:24.689> having<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.050> manager<00:00:25.410> is<00:00:25.590> really

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
think having a manager is really

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.820 
think having a manager is really
beneficial<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:27.000> us<00:00:27.150> because<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:28.289> allows<00:00:28.500> us<00:00:28.710> to

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
beneficial to us because it allows us to

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.880 
beneficial to us because it allows us to
focus<00:00:29.189> really<00:00:29.429> just<00:00:29.699> on<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.150> game<00:00:30.740> you<00:00:31.740> would

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
focus really just on the game you would

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.010 
focus really just on the game you would
think<00:00:32.250> that<00:00:32.340> it's<00:00:32.579> just<00:00:32.719> scheduling<00:00:33.719> and

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
think that it's just scheduling and

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.270 
think that it's just scheduling and
getting<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.320> team<00:00:34.469> up<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:34.980> ready<00:00:35.160> to

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
getting the team up and ready to

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.610 
getting the team up and ready to
practice<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:36.180> kind<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.809> organizing<00:00:37.469> things

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
practice and kind of organizing things

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.979 
practice and kind of organizing things
but<00:00:37.980> it's<00:00:38.250> so<00:00:38.430> much<00:00:38.460> more<00:00:38.850> if<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.570> team<00:00:39.809> had

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
but it's so much more if the team had

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.540 
but it's so much more if the team had
any<00:00:40.170> problems<00:00:40.559> they<00:00:40.800> would<00:00:40.890> come<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.250> me<00:00:41.340> a

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
any problems they would come to me a

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.850 
any problems they would come to me a
manager<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.540> pretty<00:00:43.020> much<00:00:43.200> all<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.620> stuff<00:00:43.680> you

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
manager is pretty much all the stuff you

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.049 
manager is pretty much all the stuff you
don't<00:00:44.010> want<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.309> deal<00:00:44.430> with<00:00:44.579> they<00:00:44.730> take<00:00:44.910> care

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
don't want to deal with they take care

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.510 
don't want to deal with they take care
of<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.750> can<00:00:45.989> always<00:00:46.350> perform<00:00:46.559> at<00:00:46.829> 100%

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520
