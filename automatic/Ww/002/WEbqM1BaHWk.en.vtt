00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.380
 we are now on the pre-show of the movie planes 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.380
 fire and water 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:21.330
 I'm prescriptions of waiting films of 25 degrees 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.340
 childhood I can handle 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.740
 and I won't get diplom for a long time 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.740
 counted each plane 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.150
 the movie was watched and I just learned the flow 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.070
 what turns out to be this continuation of the movie 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.070
 cartoon planes out in the past 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.170
 the year and the main character is the same 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.180
 fields more modest by plane which 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.949
 working with household spray and 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.360
 despite the fact that it works on 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.360
 simple provincial 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.640
 the airfield he dreams of taking 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:20.880
 participation in the races of the fastest aircraft 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:23.420
 only here is dasti and I am very afraid of heights 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.420
 bust 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.690
 in the airplane cartoon fire and water 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.360
 Dusty is already an air legend 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.610
 races and but then he finds out that his 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.320
 the engine is badly damaged and it is already 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.090
 will never be able to participate speed 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.320
 air races nonetheless 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.960
 fate gives him another chance and 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.760
 he will get acquainted with 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.260
 fire and rescue team which 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.590
 leads veterans 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.800
 Aviation by name and ranger screw funny 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.930
 moments 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.050
 jokes related to aviation is the most 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:07.890
 cool try wheels push out 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:11.450
 her pro and tips under me clean 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.450
 pretty close to the fire 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.160
 the earth I never understand how it is 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.560
 can be parachuted and 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.880
 perfectly normal airplane crap 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.880
 you now 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:39.150
 but in general it turned out very kind and sweet 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.720
 and most importantly light is cool so 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.770
 I advise you to look to plunge into childhood and 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:49.750
 maybe there go children and little brothers and 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.750
 and our smaller brothers
