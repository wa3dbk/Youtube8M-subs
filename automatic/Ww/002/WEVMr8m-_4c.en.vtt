so I'm going to tell you a few things
about<00:00:02.129> the<00:00:03.230> DWS<00:00:04.230> 780<00:00:05.029> this<00:00:06.029> is<00:00:06.270> the<00:00:07.200> newest<00:00:07.649> 12

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
about the DWS 780 this is the newest 12

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.950 
about the DWS 780 this is the newest 12
inch<00:00:08.700> slide<00:00:08.970> saw<00:00:09.269> from<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.719> wall<00:00:10.759> as<00:00:11.759> you<00:00:12.660> can

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
inch slide saw from the wall as you can

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.849 
inch slide saw from the wall as you can
see<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.440> base<00:00:14.219> is<00:00:14.610> a<00:00:15.299> little<00:00:15.450> bit<00:00:15.900> smaller

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
see the base is a little bit smaller

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.349 
see the base is a little bit smaller
than<00:00:17.070> you<00:00:17.400> might<00:00:17.580> see<00:00:17.820> on<00:00:17.850> some<00:00:18.150> of<00:00:18.240> their

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
than you might see on some of their

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.810 
than you might see on some of their
other<00:00:18.480> saws<00:00:18.980> you're<00:00:19.980> missing<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.550> little<00:00:20.699> bit

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
other saws you're missing a little bit

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.519 
other saws you're missing a little bit
of<00:00:20.939> stock<00:00:21.180> support<00:00:21.689> in<00:00:21.900> here<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:23.160> benefit<00:00:23.760> is

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
of stock support in here the benefit is

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.310 
of stock support in here the benefit is
it<00:00:25.529> makes<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:26.010> lighter<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.869> you<00:00:27.869> really<00:00:28.140> don't

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
it makes it lighter and you really don't

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.780 
it makes it lighter and you really don't
notice<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.920> too<00:00:29.189> much<00:00:31.040> having<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.219> that

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
notice that too much having that that

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.830 
notice that too much having that that
missing<00:00:33.210> surface<00:00:33.600> there<00:00:33.870> this<00:00:34.500> saw<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:35.250> about

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
missing surface there this saw is about

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.700 
missing surface there this saw is about
the<00:00:36.840> same<00:00:37.140> weight<00:00:37.469> as<00:00:37.739> my<00:00:38.430> Makita<00:00:38.910> 10<00:00:39.149> inch<00:00:39.329> and

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
the same weight as my Makita 10 inch and

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.970 
the same weight as my Makita 10 inch and
has<00:00:40.710> quite<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.730> bit<00:00:41.969> more<00:00:42.180> capacity<00:00:42.540> than<00:00:43.110> that

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
has quite a bit more capacity than that

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.520 
has quite a bit more capacity than that
one<00:00:44.629> another<00:00:45.629> thing<00:00:45.899> you'll<00:00:46.050> notice<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.500> that

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
one another thing you'll notice is that

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.680 
one another thing you'll notice is that
the<00:00:47.190> base<00:00:48.079> sits<00:00:49.079> really<00:00:49.350> tight<00:00:49.770> down<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.309> this

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
the base sits really tight down to this

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.930 
the base sits really tight down to this
table<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:51.719> it's<00:00:51.960> mounted<00:00:52.140> on<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.940> the

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
table that it's mounted on and the

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.510 
table that it's mounted on and the
benefit<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.480> is<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:54.930> have<00:00:55.110> less<00:00:55.920> sawdust

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
benefit to that is you have less sawdust

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.110 
benefit to that is you have less sawdust
and<00:00:56.699> chips

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
and chips

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.099 
and chips
getting<00:00:57.629> stuck<00:00:57.899> in<00:00:58.109> there<00:00:58.370> and<00:00:59.719> it's<00:01:00.719> easier

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
getting stuck in there and it's easier

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.160 
getting stuck in there and it's easier
to<00:01:01.170> keep<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:02.280> workspace<00:01:02.730> clean<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.420> it's

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
to keep the workspace clean and it's

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.950 
to keep the workspace clean and it's
just<00:01:04.320> nice<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.799> have<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.189> lower<00:01:05.720> profile<00:01:06.720> and

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
just nice to have that lower profile and

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:07.850 
just nice to have that lower profile and
not<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.080> bunch<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.470> junk

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
not a bunch of junk

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.070 
not a bunch of junk
underneath<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.670> saw<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.840> have<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.020> really

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
underneath the saw you have a really

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.210 
underneath the saw you have a really
clear<00:01:13.080> bevel<00:01:13.500> scale<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:15.920> several<00:01:16.920> bevel

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
clear bevel scale and several bevel

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:25.940 
clear bevel scale and several bevel
stops<00:01:17.549> in<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.270> back<00:01:21.140> easy<00:01:22.140> adjustment<00:01:22.860> for<00:01:24.950> 90

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
stops in the back easy adjustment for 90

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:33.170 
stops in the back easy adjustment for 90
degrees<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:28.340> the<00:01:29.840> lock<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:31.110> in<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.829> rear<00:01:32.180> but

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
degrees and the lock is in the rear but

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.840 
degrees and the lock is in the rear but
it's<00:01:33.329> pretty<00:01:33.900> big<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.170> easy<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.650> grab<00:01:34.860> this<00:01:35.610> is

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
it's pretty big and easy to grab this is

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.090 
it's pretty big and easy to grab this is
this<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.240> think<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.990> standard<00:01:37.470> knob<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.979> is

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
this I think the standard knob that is

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.880 
this I think the standard knob that is
on<00:01:38.280> all<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.570> Walt<00:01:39.750> saws<00:01:40.049> at<00:01:40.560> least<00:01:40.740> the

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
on all that the Walt saws at least the

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.580 
on all that the Walt saws at least the
ones<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.189> I've<00:01:41.310> used<00:01:41.780> the<00:01:42.780> minor<00:01:43.020> scale<00:01:43.229> is

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
ones that I've used the minor scale is

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.100 
ones that I've used the minor scale is
also<00:01:43.920> very<00:01:44.130> readable<00:01:44.659> and<00:01:46.250> you<00:01:47.250> can<00:01:47.430> adjust<00:01:47.850> it

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
also very readable and you can adjust it

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.830 
also very readable and you can adjust it
side<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.290> side<00:01:49.500> if<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:50.490> need<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.240> square<00:01:51.720> up

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
side to side if you need to to square up

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.889 
side to side if you need to to square up
the<00:01:51.869> saw<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.920> detents<00:01:53.520> adjust<00:01:54.030> with<00:01:54.720> the

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
the saw and the detents adjust with the

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.980 
the saw and the detents adjust with the
scale<00:01:55.229> there's<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.310> detent<00:01:56.820> override<00:01:57.360> right

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
scale there's a detent override right

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.870 
scale there's a detent override right
here<00:01:58.380> if<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:59.369> need<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.579> cut<00:01:59.939> just<00:02:00.810> off<00:02:01.079> a

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
here if you need to cut just off a

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.010 
here if you need to cut just off a
standard<00:02:02.880> detent<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.509> don't<00:02:03.719> want<00:02:03.899> it

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
standard detent and you don't want it

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.780 
standard detent and you don't want it
falling<00:02:04.320> in

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
falling in

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.180 
falling in
that<00:02:06.600> makes<00:02:06.840> this<00:02:07.050> you<00:02:07.200> just<00:02:07.560> swing<00:02:07.800> this<00:02:07.950> off

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
that makes this you just swing this off

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.580 
that makes this you just swing this off
smoothly<00:02:08.580> around<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.390> whatever<00:02:09.929> angle<00:02:10.410> you

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
the way it's not a big deal and they're

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.729 
the way it's not a big deal and they're
very<00:02:41.370> square<00:02:41.820> to<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.480> base<00:02:42.690> this<00:02:43.290> saw<00:02:43.500> does

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
very square to the base this saw does

the<00:03:10.099> light<00:03:10.370> on<00:03:10.640> this<00:03:10.849> saw<00:03:11.090> and<00:03:12.069> it<00:03:13.069> serves<00:03:13.340> two

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
the light on this saw and it serves two

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.290 
the light on this saw and it serves two
purposes<00:03:13.870> first<00:03:15.280> it<00:03:16.280> illuminates<00:03:16.760> the

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
purposes first it illuminates the

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.470 
purposes first it illuminates the
cutting<00:03:17.630> area<00:03:17.780> and<00:03:18.650> secondly<00:03:19.300> because<00:03:20.300> it

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
cutting area and secondly because it

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.920 
cutting area and secondly because it
projects<00:03:21.170> from<00:03:22.100> both<00:03:22.370> sides<00:03:22.670> of<00:03:22.850> the<00:03:22.910> blade<00:03:23.060> it

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
projects from both sides of the blade it

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.960 
projects from both sides of the blade it
creates<00:03:24.260> a<00:03:24.380> shadow<00:03:24.580> when<00:03:25.580> you<00:03:25.700> bring<00:03:25.850> the

blade teeth down close to the workpiece

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.330 
blade teeth down close to the workpiece
you<00:03:28.610> have<00:03:28.760> a<00:03:28.790> crisp<00:03:29.239> line<00:03:29.600> that<00:03:30.380> shows<00:03:31.130> you

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
you have a crisp line that shows you

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.580 
you have a crisp line that shows you
where<00:03:31.489> your<00:03:31.640> cuts<00:03:31.910> going<00:03:32.060> to<00:03:32.180> be<00:03:32.330> you<00:03:33.019> actually

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
where your cuts going to be you actually

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.580 
where your cuts going to be you actually
cut<00:03:33.860> just<00:03:34.580> slightly<00:03:35.000> wide<00:03:35.450> of<00:03:35.690> it<00:03:35.840> but<00:03:36.440> it's

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
cut just slightly wide of it but it's

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.830 
cut just slightly wide of it but it's
really<00:03:36.650> handy<00:03:37.340> for<00:03:37.519> reference<00:03:37.940> especially<00:03:38.569> if

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
really handy for reference especially if

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.020 
really handy for reference especially if
you<00:03:39.620> don't<00:03:39.800> have<00:03:39.980> a<00:03:40.010> lot<00:03:40.280> of<00:03:40.310> good<00:03:40.580> lighting

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
you don't have a lot of good lighting

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
where you're working the light may just

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.360 
where you're working the light may just
be<00:03:43.790> the<00:03:43.819> best<00:03:43.970> feature<00:03:44.450> about<00:03:44.600> this<00:03:45.080> saw<00:03:45.370> now

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
be the best feature about this saw now

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.360 
be the best feature about this saw now
for<00:03:46.640> the<00:03:46.700> bad<00:03:46.880> news<00:03:47.350> the<00:03:48.350> slide<00:03:48.680> on<00:03:48.950> this<00:03:49.100> saw

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
for the bad news the slide on this saw

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.910 
for the bad news the slide on this saw
is<00:03:49.700> awful<00:03:52.720> it's<00:03:53.720> just<00:03:54.019> not<00:03:54.170> very<00:03:54.200> smooth<00:03:54.769> at

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
is awful it's just not very smooth at

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.430 
is awful it's just not very smooth at
all<00:03:55.040> and<00:03:55.400> you<00:03:56.060> that<00:03:56.269> really<00:03:56.510> have<00:03:56.780> to<00:03:56.810> fight<00:03:57.200> it

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
all and you that really have to fight it

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.970 
all and you that really have to fight it
especially<00:03:58.010> on<00:03:58.130> Steve<00:03:58.489> bevel<00:03:58.880> cuts<00:03:59.739> I'm<00:04:00.739> not

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
especially on Steve bevel cuts I'm not

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.220 
especially on Steve bevel cuts I'm not
sure<00:04:02.500> why<00:04:03.500> that<00:04:03.980> is<00:04:04.430> it<00:04:05.209> seems<00:04:05.510> like<00:04:05.750> possibly

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
sure why that is it seems like possibly

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.160 
sure why that is it seems like possibly
just<00:04:06.530> an<00:04:06.680> engineering<00:04:07.220> oversight<00:04:08.170> possibly

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
just an engineering oversight possibly

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.400 
just an engineering oversight possibly
making<00:04:09.380> these<00:04:09.590> bars<00:04:09.890> too<00:04:10.190> small<00:04:10.519> or<00:04:11.410> skimping

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
making these bars too small or skimping

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.400 
making these bars too small or skimping
on<00:04:12.530> the<00:04:12.799> housing<00:04:13.609> and<00:04:13.760> the<00:04:13.820> guides<00:04:14.260> there's<00:04:15.260> an

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
on the housing and the guides there's an

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.580 
on the housing and the guides there's an
adjustment<00:04:15.829> screw<00:04:16.720> which<00:04:17.720> is<00:04:17.750> a<00:04:17.900> small<00:04:18.200> allen

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
adjustment screw which is a small allen

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.830 
adjustment screw which is a small allen
screw<00:04:18.829> right<00:04:19.010> here<00:04:19.070> behind<00:04:19.489> the<00:04:19.940> slide<00:04:20.450> lock

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
screw right here behind the slide lock

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.860 
screw right here behind the slide lock
knob<00:04:21.169> and<00:04:21.820> theoretically<00:04:22.820> that<00:04:22.970> allows<00:04:23.479> you

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
knob and theoretically that allows you

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.170 
knob and theoretically that allows you
to<00:04:24.310> change<00:04:25.310> how<00:04:26.060> tight<00:04:26.570> or<00:04:26.840> loose<00:04:27.820> the<00:04:28.820> slide

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
to change how tight or loose the slide

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.170 
to change how tight or loose the slide
is<00:04:29.479> but<00:04:30.410> the<00:04:30.770> adjustment<00:04:31.280> is<00:04:31.370> really<00:04:31.700> not<00:04:31.820> fine

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
is but the adjustment is really not fine

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.170 
is but the adjustment is really not fine
enough<00:04:32.539> to<00:04:33.550> really<00:04:34.550> make<00:04:34.729> a<00:04:34.760> meaningful

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
enough to really make a meaningful

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.170 
enough to really make a meaningful
difference<00:04:35.620> there's<00:04:36.620> just<00:04:37.010> a<00:04:37.160> very<00:04:37.729> small

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
difference there's just a very small

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.790 
difference there's just a very small
turn<00:04:38.479> between<00:04:39.169> sloppy<00:04:39.860> and<00:04:41.560> totally<00:04:42.560> locked

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
turn between sloppy and totally locked

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.390 
turn between sloppy and totally locked
down<00:04:43.130> so<00:04:43.570> it's<00:04:44.570> not<00:04:44.720> that<00:04:44.990> useful<00:04:45.400> you'll

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
down so it's not that useful you'll

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.040 
down so it's not that useful you'll
notice<00:04:46.700> they<00:04:46.850> have<00:04:47.030> a<00:04:47.060> rubber<00:04:47.390> boot<00:04:47.690> here

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
notice they have a rubber boot here

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.320 
notice they have a rubber boot here
behind<00:04:48.380> the<00:04:48.500> blade<00:04:48.740> that<00:04:49.550> acts<00:04:49.820> as<00:04:50.000> a<00:04:50.060> dust

collector obviously doesn't get all of
it<00:04:53.660> but<00:04:54.289> it's<00:04:55.130> worth<00:04:55.400> hooking<00:04:56.180> up<00:04:56.300> a<00:04:56.450> vacuum<00:04:56.720> to

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
it but it's worth hooking up a vacuum to

this saw if you can it definitely makes

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.909 
this saw if you can it definitely makes
a<00:04:59.419> noticeable<00:04:59.900> difference<00:05:00.080> and<00:05:00.620> how<00:05:00.710> much

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
a noticeable difference and how much

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:02.080 
a noticeable difference and how much
dust<00:05:01.220> you<00:05:01.370> leave<00:05:01.580> around

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
I really like the tall fences they're

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:07.930 
I really like the tall fences they're
very<00:05:05.660> square<00:05:05.960> to<00:05:06.050> the<00:05:06.169> base<00:05:06.610> your<00:05:07.610> minor<00:05:07.850> scale

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
very square to the base your minor scale

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.070 
very square to the base your minor scale
is<00:05:08.510> very<00:05:08.810> readable<00:05:09.080> as<00:05:09.470> is<00:05:09.889> your<00:05:10.010> bevel<00:05:10.220> scale

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
is very readable as is your bevel scale

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.249 
is very readable as is your bevel scale
the<00:05:12.500> weight<00:05:12.710> is<00:05:12.740> good<00:05:13.160> the<00:05:13.940> light<00:05:14.180> is<00:05:14.479> awesome

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:15.259

I<00:05:15.340> really<00:05:16.340> wish<00:05:16.520> the<00:05:16.729> slide<00:05:17.030> was<00:05:17.300> better<00:05:17.569> and

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
I really wish the slide was better and

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.430 
I really wish the slide was better and
there<00:05:19.370> wasn't<00:05:19.699> so<00:05:19.819> much<00:05:19.970> flex<00:05:20.419> in<00:05:20.690> the<00:05:20.750> head

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
there wasn't so much flex in the head

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.360 
there wasn't so much flex in the head
when<00:05:21.620> it's<00:05:21.800> extended<00:05:22.930> all<00:05:23.930> around<00:05:24.440> it's<00:05:25.069> still

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
when it's extended all around it's still

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.990 
when it's extended all around it's still
a<00:05:25.400> very<00:05:25.699> versatile<00:05:26.180> saw<00:05:26.449> for<00:05:27.460> general<00:05:28.460> trim

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
a very versatile saw for general trim

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.320 
a very versatile saw for general trim
work<00:05:29.240> if<00:05:30.229> I<00:05:30.409> had<00:05:30.650> to<00:05:30.770> pick<00:05:31.009> one<00:05:31.310> saw<00:05:31.639> to<00:05:32.000> keep<00:05:32.180> in

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
work if I had to pick one saw to keep in

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.629 
work if I had to pick one saw to keep in
my<00:05:32.479> van<00:05:32.750> most<00:05:33.650> of<00:05:33.800> the<00:05:33.889> time<00:05:34.099> this<00:05:34.400> would

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:34.639 
my van most of the time this would

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:39.029 
my van most of the time this would
probably<00:05:35.150> be<00:05:35.330> it<00:05:35.479> right<00:05:35.720> now<00:05:36.159> the<00:05:37.159> downside<00:05:37.430> is

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:39.039 
probably be it right now the downside is

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:41.950 
probably be it right now the downside is

board making long cuts that use the

whole<00:05:45.770> slide<00:05:46.009> capacity<00:05:46.610> that<00:05:46.789> you<00:05:46.849> need<00:05:46.940> be

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
whole slide capacity that you need be

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.480 
whole slide capacity that you need be
accurate<00:05:47.599> I'll<00:05:48.319> still<00:05:48.650> be<00:05:48.770> going<00:05:48.919> back<00:05:49.159> to<00:05:49.340> my
