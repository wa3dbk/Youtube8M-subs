bit<00:00:07.230> closer<00:00:07.820> closer<00:00:09.650> bit<00:00:10.650> closer

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.940 

okay<00:02:29.160> so<00:02:29.220> as<00:02:29.730> you<00:02:29.760> can<00:02:30.090> see<00:02:30.390> we<00:02:31.349> have<00:02:31.530> a<00:02:31.560> line

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
okay so as you can see we have a line

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.690 
okay so as you can see we have a line
just<00:02:32.910> here<00:02:33.349> just<00:02:34.349> running<00:02:35.160> directly<00:02:35.310> along

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
just here just running directly along

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.449 
just here just running directly along
there<00:02:36.349> which<00:02:37.349> I<00:02:37.470> usually<00:02:37.680> I<00:02:37.890> usually<00:02:38.310> do<00:02:38.430> like

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
there which I usually I usually do like

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.309 
there which I usually I usually do like
a<00:02:38.640> small<00:02:38.819> braid<00:02:39.180> going<00:02:39.540> around<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.930> leave<00:02:40.110> art

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
a small braid going around the leave art

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.039 
a small braid going around the leave art
anyway<00:02:40.709> just<00:02:40.920> for<00:02:41.569> security<00:02:42.569> I<00:02:42.599> guess<00:02:42.870> I<00:02:42.900> don't

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
anyway just for security I guess I don't

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.009 
anyway just for security I guess I don't
know<00:02:43.200> and<00:02:43.470> then<00:02:44.150> there's<00:02:45.150> just<00:02:45.239> one<00:02:45.629> going

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
know and then there's just one going

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.130 
know and then there's just one going
along<00:02:46.319> here<00:02:46.709> I<00:02:47.180> haven't<00:02:48.180> done<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.540> braids<00:02:48.780> so

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
along here I haven't done the braids so

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.319 
along here I haven't done the braids so
close<00:02:49.530> here<00:02:49.830> because<00:02:50.069> I<00:02:50.190> like<00:02:50.549> to<00:02:50.819> match<00:02:51.030> up

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
close here because I like to match up

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.710 
close here because I like to match up
the<00:02:51.840> top<00:02:52.560> of<00:02:52.590> this<00:02:52.829> braid<00:02:53.130> with<00:02:53.459> here<00:02:54.090> kind<00:02:54.569> of

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
the top of this braid with here kind of

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.720 
the top of this braid with here kind of
if<00:02:54.959> you<00:02:55.110> I<00:02:55.200> mean<00:02:55.260> so<00:02:55.890> it's<00:02:56.010> kind<00:02:56.190> of<00:02:56.250> closed<00:02:56.459> and

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
if you I mean so it's kind of closed and

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.750 
if you I mean so it's kind of closed and
I<00:02:56.970> know<00:02:57.060> I'm<00:02:57.209> doing<00:02:57.420> anyway<00:02:57.660> but<00:02:57.989> yeah<00:02:58.519> and<00:02:59.519> I

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
I know I'm doing anyway but yeah and I

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.000 
I know I'm doing anyway but yeah and I
just<00:02:59.849> did<00:03:00.180> just<00:03:00.209> normal<00:03:00.660> Camrose<00:03:01.079> going<00:03:01.829> down

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
just did just normal Camrose going down

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.830 
just did just normal Camrose going down
the<00:03:02.160> back<00:03:02.280> tilt<00:03:02.730> your<00:03:02.790> head<00:03:02.880> down<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:03.269> then

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
the back tilt your head down and then

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.949 
the back tilt your head down and then
just<00:03:04.170> a<00:03:04.319> couple<00:03:04.500> on<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.129> bottom<00:03:05.569> there<00:03:06.569> and

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
just a couple on the bottom there and

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.250 
just a couple on the bottom there and
then<00:03:07.670> basically<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:08.790> same<00:03:09.120> situation<00:03:10.049> on

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
then basically the same situation on

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.380 
then basically the same situation on
this<00:03:10.829> side<00:03:11.099> just<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.489> braids<00:03:11.790> going<00:03:12.090> back

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
this side just the braids going back

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.380 
this side just the braids going back
round<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:13.459> this<00:03:14.459> is<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:14.760> other<00:03:14.879> side<00:03:15.150> of<00:03:15.329> the

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
round and this is the other side of the

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.660 
round and this is the other side of the
small<00:03:15.660> braid<00:03:15.959> here<00:03:16.319> and<00:03:16.620> it's<00:03:17.370> just<00:03:17.519> coming

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
small braid here and it's just coming

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.130 
small braid here and it's just coming
around<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.209> front<00:03:18.450> because<00:03:18.870> we're<00:03:18.989> going<00:03:19.079> to

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
around the front because we're going to

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.039 
around the front because we're going to
have<00:03:19.379> some<00:03:19.739> of<00:03:19.860> the<00:03:20.040> trucks<00:03:21.000> laying<00:03:21.360> down<00:03:21.660> here

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
have some of the trucks laying down here

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.050 
have some of the trucks laying down here
but<00:03:22.709> then<00:03:22.859> it<00:03:22.889> will<00:03:23.069> all<00:03:23.190> be<00:03:23.370> covered<00:03:23.670> by<00:03:24.000> this

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
but then it will all be covered by this

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.120 
but then it will all be covered by this
braid<00:03:24.660> everything<00:03:25.410> that's<00:03:25.560> going<00:03:25.769> on<00:03:25.859> will<00:03:26.040> be

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
braid everything that's going on will be

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.650 
braid everything that's going on will be
covered<00:03:26.430> by<00:03:26.549> this<00:03:26.819> one<00:03:27.060> here<00:03:27.329> which<00:03:27.480> I<00:03:27.630> will

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
covered by this one here which I will

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.819 
covered by this one here which I will
double<00:03:28.109> up<00:03:28.489> along<00:03:29.489> here<00:03:30.319> and<00:03:31.319> then<00:03:31.500> this<00:03:31.590> one's

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
double up along here and then this one's

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.309 
double up along here and then this one's
just<00:03:31.920> going<00:03:32.310> round<00:03:32.579> and<00:03:33.150> then<00:03:33.780> just<00:03:34.079> joins

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
just going round and then just joins

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.890 
just going round and then just joins
onto<00:03:34.709> the<00:03:35.010> back<00:03:35.190> there<00:03:35.700> and<00:03:35.970> then<00:03:36.660> this<00:03:36.750> is

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
onto the back there and then this is

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.900 
onto the back there and then this is
like<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:37.319> end<00:03:37.440> of<00:03:37.620> all<00:03:37.799> the<00:03:37.920> camera<00:03:38.280> all<00:03:38.790> the

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
like the end of all the camera all the

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.020 
like the end of all the camera all the
cameras<00:03:39.329> here<00:03:40.230> just<00:03:40.590> all<00:03:40.709> joined<00:03:40.950> together<00:03:41.099> so

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
cameras here just all joined together so

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.020 
cameras here just all joined together so
I<00:03:42.060> will<00:03:42.420> just<00:03:42.599> stitch<00:03:42.959> these<00:03:43.430> down<00:03:44.430> wherever

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
I will just stitch these down wherever

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.210 
I will just stitch these down wherever
it<00:03:45.180> lays<00:03:45.359> flat<00:03:45.389> issed<00:03:46.109> and<00:03:46.440> this<00:03:46.950> one<00:03:47.099> I<00:03:47.130> just

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
it lays flat issed and this one I just

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.180 
it lays flat issed and this one I just
stitched<00:03:47.700> down<00:03:47.880> anyway<00:03:48.329> it's<00:03:48.510> a<00:03:48.630> small<00:03:48.900> one<00:03:49.079> so

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
stitched down anyway it's a small one so

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.729 
stitched down anyway it's a small one so
doesn't<00:03:50.190> really<00:03:50.310> matter<00:03:50.639> so<00:03:51.560> that'll<00:03:52.560> be<00:03:52.650> all

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
doesn't really matter so that'll be all

00:03:52.739 --> 00:07:07.530 
doesn't really matter so that'll be all
fine<00:03:52.950> oh<00:03:53.250> yeah<00:03:53.760> see<00:03:54.450> you<00:03:54.540> in<00:03:54.599> a<00:03:54.720> bit

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:07.540
