00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:13.259
 put an end to imports in the wind for development and 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.470
 production of freshwater fish the solution is taking shape 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.329
 like here in town do a hatchery of a production capacity of 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:25.490
 several million larvae tears of the card that one hires and silvered 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:29.630
 in this facility which depends on the direction of the fishing one applies 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.949
 in his gestures the time is to artificial breeding selection of 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:38.510
 spawners treatment for my donkey these convictions and ends collection of 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.530
 tears 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.250
 the plate effect allowed ford behind 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.270
 those of the canvas using 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.650
 fish born to mothers not their hours in their aquatic environment is 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.650
 persuaded the process of artificial fertilization 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.620
 the females the card receive injections we wait a few days for 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.880
 the anger of others who will eventually be put in a pool where they will be 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.060
 fed on the Feast of Evidence after we proceed to anger 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.260
 will she present the work 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.680
 barbara shulz evening 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.200
 once the fry are collected 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.770
 place now at seeding for this there are several bodies of water 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.610
 the objective is to develop the fishing sector to increase production 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.710
 fisheries and job creation 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.030
 and that's not going well 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.860
 the production of the albums ensured the repopulation of the plants for the 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.050
 landscapes if inland fishing activities 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.110
 such a process can only increase fish production those who see 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.030
 a superego generate employment especially in this area she the 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.729
 artificial fertilization of freshwater fish 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.950
 is part of the development strategy 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.729
 of aquaculture a strategy that is the happiness of fishermen and of course 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.439
 that of fish consumers
