00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:08.580
 hello everyone with you pete and this video tutorial 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:11.040
 on a smooth transition on anchors how are they 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.590
 how to make them here i have an example 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.109
 which is already done that is if i 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.900
 Now let cool on a service I 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.840
 moves smoothly to my section with 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.369
 service to the portfolio she klatsat 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.730
 portfolio for a feast I because more already 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.800
 not 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.740
 down can be given soon let the hill 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.230
 cool and comes to us on the hill 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.450
 wring out so smooth 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.600
 Go to the page you can do it 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.579
 simple healers and little javascript 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.079
 and so we see the code that's where I 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.390
 grandfather menus on which sticky 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.190
 in our links if anyone knows what 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.050
 such anchors are desirable to you by their 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.390
 read how to do them and 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.600
 and so on here i'm explaining home not 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.379
 I will, and so I have in the links 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.420
 name korea and also in blocks where are they 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.149
 I have to go to come clicks 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.070
 i.e. home here on m service so on 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.250
 in order to make a smooth transition 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.250
 we need to connect the library 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.250
 javascript 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:14.240
 we connect here is dedicated 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:19.530
 library and also we need a small 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:22.229
 javascript which is written so to us 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.130
 you need exactly this full scroll 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.560
 anchors explain the maiden script special 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.200
 I will probably not be here a little bit 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.780
 I will explain, that is, we take all of ours here . 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.259
 link where we start first 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.380
 symbol 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.530
 lattice that is when you click on this link 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.479
 like this one function 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.310
 Basically, you don't need to know what 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.040
 here that is, here we are already coming yes 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.580
 So 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.130
 we have water and this animation when we 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.320
 we click 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.230
 above we are with a crawl that is to such 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.270
 distance in one second that is 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:05.200
 it turns out we exhibit here 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:09.580
 time that will scroll to the desired 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:13.660
 section when you click on the link and here so 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:18.180
 the same goes the opposite will be somewhat 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:21.310
 Clicks back so well I think 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.130
 particularly, in principle, you are not their code 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:27.160
 you need to know the way you have everything 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.170
 she already teaches you all the elements 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.100
 Just insert it and you will have it 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.170
 work and so I basically put in 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.500
 now I can go to my page 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:42.190
 update and watch cool service 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:46.180
 so stop, I probably have not here 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:50.580
 connected library jake brew up so 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:54.400
 website copy then copy the glands 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:03:02.220
 javascript and insert all the ladies tadam 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:02.220
 daddy gs and put it in here 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.470
 everything is fine now should work for us 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.930
 cool service and see here we have a lot 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.760
 one second goes to this 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.850
 cool portfolio element 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.310
 goes to the portfolio that is such 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.930
 chip if you want to change the time or 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.790
 do it faster do mini this 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.780
 change here and let's put three 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.580
 seconds i have this 3000 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.530
 milliseconds and so updating 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.320
 a class on the service we will be three seconds 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.620
 go to our service see yes 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:40.020
 This is how you can make a smooth transition by 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.020
 anchors everyone thank you all bye
