00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
about you know you have to once you hit

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.469

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
don't understand if you go off you

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.649 
don't understand if you go off you
explode<00:01:17.220> multi<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:17.909> also<00:01:18.270> doesn't<00:01:18.450> know<00:01:18.509> how<00:01:18.570> to

drive<00:01:18.810> stick<00:01:19.110> shift<00:01:19.170> so<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.530> makes<00:01:19.830> sense

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
drive stick shift so that makes sense

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.420
