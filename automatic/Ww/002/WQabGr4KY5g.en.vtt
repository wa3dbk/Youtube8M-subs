repair is called the pesky heater hose
replacement<00:00:28.200> which<00:00:28.469> is<00:00:28.680> very<00:00:29.040> difficult<00:00:29.399> to

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:29.579 
replacement which is very difficult to

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:31.400 
replacement which is very difficult to
get<00:00:29.790> through<00:00:29.969> so<00:00:30.210> I<00:00:30.239> thought<00:00:30.480> what<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.660> do<00:00:30.779> is

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
get through so I thought what I do is

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.110 
get through so I thought what I do is
run<00:00:31.800> through<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.340> pick<00:00:32.489> some<00:00:32.669> specific

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
run through it and pick some specific

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.549 
run through it and pick some specific
camera<00:00:33.360> angles<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.899> show<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.140> how<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.350> access

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
camera angles to show you how to access

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.979 
camera angles to show you how to access
it<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.429> we'll<00:00:35.969> see<00:00:36.149> if<00:00:36.239> we<00:00:36.359> can't<00:00:36.600> make<00:00:36.660> this

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
it and we'll see if we can't make this

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.590 
it and we'll see if we can't make this
as<00:00:37.410> efficient<00:00:37.890> as<00:00:38.010> possible<00:00:38.550> now<00:00:39.179> the<00:00:39.239> general

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
as efficient as possible now the general

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.569 
as efficient as possible now the general
order<00:00:39.839> of<00:00:39.929> operations<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.589> get<00:00:40.710> started<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.339> to

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
order of operations to get started is to

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.029 
order of operations to get started is to
drain<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.239> radiator<00:00:42.329> fluid<00:00:42.870> take<00:00:43.620> off<00:00:43.800> that

00:00:44.029 --> 00:00:44.039 
drain the radiator fluid take off that

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:47.000 
drain the radiator fluid take off that
driver's<00:00:44.640> side<00:00:44.850> front<00:00:45.480> tire<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.320> then<00:00:46.649> begin

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
driver's side front tire and then begin

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.520 
driver's side front tire and then begin
removing<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:48.030> inner<00:00:48.269> fender<00:00:48.690> well<00:00:48.719> panels<00:00:49.350> so

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
removing the inner fender well panels so

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.439 
removing the inner fender well panels so
that<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.739> can<00:00:49.890> access<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.550> hood<00:00:50.760> all<00:00:51.300> right

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
that you can access the hood all right

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.069 
that you can access the hood all right
so<00:00:51.929> with<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.170> said<00:00:52.379> let's<00:00:52.890> get<00:00:53.010> started<00:00:54.079> okay

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
so with that said let's get started okay

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.079 
so with that said let's get started okay
so<00:00:55.399> to<00:00:56.399> get<00:00:56.489> access<00:00:56.909> to<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.149> radiator<00:00:57.510> drain<00:00:57.929> I

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.089 
so to get access to the radiator drain I

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:02.840 
so to get access to the radiator drain I

know the point of the failure okay just

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.560 
know the point of the failure okay just
a<00:03:45.290> set<00:03:45.800> expectations<00:03:46.100> it<00:03:46.700> took<00:03:46.850> me<00:03:47.000> about<00:03:47.240> an

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
a set expectations it took me about an

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.800 
a set expectations it took me about an
hour<00:03:47.830> of<00:03:48.880> fiddling<00:03:49.880> around<00:03:49.970> under<00:03:50.450> there<00:03:50.600> to

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
hour of fiddling around under there to

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.090 
hour of fiddling around under there to
get<00:03:51.050> the<00:03:51.530> hose<00:03:52.250> off<00:03:52.640> the<00:03:53.330> metal<00:03:53.870> nipple<00:03:54.800> that

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
get the hose off the metal nipple that

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.250 
get the hose off the metal nipple that
attaches<00:03:55.610> to<00:03:55.820> the<00:03:56.000> engine<00:03:56.270> block<00:03:56.360> took<00:03:57.080> quite

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
attaches to the engine block took quite

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.979 
attaches to the engine block took quite
a<00:03:57.320> bit<00:03:57.440> of<00:03:57.560> time<00:03:57.770> I<00:03:58.180> finally<00:03:59.180> ended<00:03:59.330> up<00:04:00.640> cutting

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
a bit of time I finally ended up cutting

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:07.320 
a bit of time I finally ended up cutting
the<00:04:02.989> hose<00:04:03.230> so<00:04:03.830> that<00:04:03.860> I<00:04:04.010> could<00:04:04.250> get<00:04:04.459> the<00:04:05.300> clamp

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
the hose so that I could get the clamp

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.550 
the hose so that I could get the clamp
off<00:04:08.330> the<00:04:08.390> hose<00:04:08.900> so<00:04:09.140> that<00:04:09.170> I<00:04:09.350> could<00:04:09.500> eventually

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
off the hose so that I could eventually

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.650 
off the hose so that I could eventually
remove<00:04:10.190> the<00:04:10.310> hose<00:04:10.489> but<00:04:10.730> that<00:04:10.880> took<00:04:11.000> me<00:04:11.239> that

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
remove the hose but that took me that

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.400 
remove the hose but that took me that
took<00:04:11.840> me<00:04:11.959> about<00:04:12.110> an<00:04:12.230> hour<00:04:12.320> once<00:04:12.620> you<00:04:12.800> have<00:04:14.410> the

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
took me about an hour once you have the

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.229 
took me about an hour once you have the
lower<00:04:15.739> hose<00:04:16.010> disconnected<00:04:16.760> it's<00:04:16.910> time<00:04:17.090> to

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
lower hose disconnected it's time to

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.159 
lower hose disconnected it's time to
disconnect<00:04:17.750> the<00:04:17.959> upper<00:04:18.140> heater<00:04:19.040> hose<00:04:20.019> so<00:04:21.019> that

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
disconnect the upper heater hose so that

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.620 
disconnect the upper heater hose so that
you<00:04:21.230> can<00:04:21.380> move<00:04:21.530> the<00:04:21.739> metal<00:04:21.890> to<00:04:22.510> moving<00:04:23.510> the

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
you can move the metal to moving the

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.090 
you can move the metal to moving the
metal<00:04:23.720> of<00:04:23.930> tube<00:04:24.140> allows<00:04:24.470> you<00:04:24.500> to<00:04:24.740> put<00:04:24.919> the

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
metal of tube allows you to put the

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:31.420 
metal of tube allows you to put the
lower<00:04:25.930> rubber<00:04:26.930> hose<00:04:27.880> the<00:04:28.880> new<00:04:29.120> hose<00:04:29.810> on<00:04:30.430> the

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
lower rubber hose the new hose on the

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.670 
lower rubber hose the new hose on the
engine<00:04:31.850> block<00:04:31.880> and<00:04:32.290> metal<00:04:33.290> tube<00:04:33.440> that<00:04:33.620> leads

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
engine block and metal tube that leads

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.430 
engine block and metal tube that leads
up<00:04:33.979> this<00:04:34.130> direction<00:04:34.840> but<00:04:35.840> you<00:04:35.930> can<00:04:36.080> see<00:04:36.260> there

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
up this direction but you can see there

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.950 
up this direction but you can see there
that's<00:04:36.650> where<00:04:36.830> I<00:04:36.860> disconnect<00:04:37.430> up<00:04:38.120> top<00:04:38.450> it<00:04:38.810> is

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
that's where I disconnect up top it is

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.440 
that's where I disconnect up top it is
much<00:04:39.169> easier<00:04:39.200> to<00:04:39.590> get<00:04:39.830> to<00:04:39.860> on<00:04:40.400> the<00:04:40.610> top<00:04:40.790> so<00:04:41.360> I'm

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
much easier to get to on the top so I'm

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:42.880 
much easier to get to on the top so I'm
gonna<00:04:41.540> give<00:04:41.750> a<00:04:41.780> quick<00:04:42.020> demonstration<00:04:42.229> it's

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
gonna give a quick demonstration it's

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.770 
gonna give a quick demonstration it's
too<00:04:43.070> tight<00:04:43.310> back<00:04:43.520> there<00:04:43.550> to<00:04:43.850> get<00:04:43.970> the<00:04:44.150> camera

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
too tight back there to get the camera

when<00:04:50.240> you<00:04:50.300> find<00:04:50.540> out<00:04:50.690> that<00:04:50.840> it<00:04:50.960> really<00:04:51.229> is<00:04:51.500> a

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
when you find out that it really is a

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.150 
when you find out that it really is a

pesky job it took me about 45 minutes
but<00:04:55.610> essentially<00:04:56.090> underneath<00:04:56.479> what<00:04:56.840> you<00:04:56.930> have

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
but essentially underneath what you have

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.080 
but essentially underneath what you have
is<00:04:57.710> you<00:04:57.830> have<00:04:57.950> a<00:04:57.979> metal<00:04:58.160> pipe<00:04:58.430> that<00:04:58.700> goes<00:04:58.850> up<00:04:59.060> to

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
is you have a metal pipe that goes up to

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.090 
is you have a metal pipe that goes up to
the<00:04:59.300> heater<00:04:59.570> valve<00:05:00.169> this<00:05:00.620> runs<00:05:00.890> up<00:05:01.070> your

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
the heater valve this runs up your

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.159 
the heater valve this runs up your
engine<00:05:01.490> block<00:05:01.669> and<00:05:01.910> then<00:05:02.630> you've<00:05:02.750> got<00:05:02.900> another

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
engine block and then you've got another

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.890

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
and then holding those two things

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.909
