00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.930
 and hello dickreiter here yes with one 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.770
 small on the boxing again and that 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:26.220
 a year 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:30.660
 horror movie classic in the steelbook as 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.969
 uk import from england in release date 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.750
 the fifth in november was already on 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.760
 a little bit 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.260
 they did not have that much longer time 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.440
 I had a bit of stress 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.670
 with savi there i ordered him 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.260
 long back and forth have that now 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.050
 somehow hidden from Austria by 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.410
 partner shop or from the warehouse there and me 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.430
 got 15 pounds voucher 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.070
 of which I have a dvd 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.110
 bought to the dvd someday more 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.940
 there will surely be an insider tip 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.829
 great movie but as I said about it 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.300
 later more 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.949
 today it's about the world 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.260
 or dance the devil go 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.270
 as you know him 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.869
 of course you can now uncut but without 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.260
 german soundtrack with sonar 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:15.290
 ultraviolet copies moderate I know 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.850
 not if that works the copy 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.140
 these itunes copies from abroad 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.900
 do not work the function always 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:26.700
 only with the respective itunes account 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:29.939
 out of the country so the ebook yes here 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.520
 I always want to stick things that way 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.509
 supersede 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.509
 the whole backcover 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.740
 so in the back also a nice beautiful 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.970
 I ordered artwork all year long 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.330
 because and because I have not yet 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.010
 had not cut on dvd synonymous 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.300
 and good the German soundtrack as I said 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.940
 not even this with those not so 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.710
 important to me from the first and second 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.150
 the steelbook really 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.950
 excellent 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.050
 as I see it now 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.510
 really beautiful is part of one of the 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.140
 most beautiful that I had so far it is 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.710
 not run 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.330
 but it does not have this this cheap one 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.209
 brushed what you know for example 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.580
 from sherlock holmes steelbook or from 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.830
 soldier james ryan c book he so much 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.709
 cheap act and that she is but 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.920
 Beautifully painted but just a bit dull 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.600
 held without special effects but how 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.020
 said beautiful artwork like me 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.920
 find 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:30.100
 Well then let's have a look 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.540
 selfish and ranked code and still 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.930
 Something else, no idea what that 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:41.400
 is and a nice indesign the disc 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:41.400
 as well as the frontcover one is here beautiful 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.980
 and not quite so this year 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.560
 clearly recognizable but still beautiful 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.690
 made in the back again completely on 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.570
 So worked really very nice 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.780
 goal book to an absolute classic 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:01.660
 So worthy presented as I think 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:05.049
 The film year is not the first 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.209
 quite so humorous and funny, but still 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:10.120
 he has so certain approaches has the horror 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.160
 genre revolutionizes in the sense and 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.840
 I think Reilly also has the shaky 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.470
 cam as we knew her back then 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.690
 invented 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.579
 he somehow has a camera on like that 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.780
 a wooden beam strapped and two 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.120
 People are taking profits through the forest 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.660
 run and the picture has one of them 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.000
 took 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.799
 this is because this is easy from below and 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.440
 then it looks like someone 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:31.110
 be pursued or so I believe that 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.459
 That's it, I'm not sure though 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.380
 yes, technically as I said a few 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.840
 he has to come up with a revolution 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.700
 the tricks for the low budget which 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.560
 they had 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.300
 great today of course you can see that 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.400
 but some are not quite as good as they are 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.120
 nevertheless nice hand made that find 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.120
 I always very horny 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:53.500
 today we know raimi spider man 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.580
 He filmed trilogy and it becomes 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.319
 currently also worked on a remake 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.440
 in the end, the second part was also 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:04.090
 as never before seen a remake like this 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.920
 only with a little more forward has he 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.560
 made the film so similar again 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.569
 but as I said a real reboot the 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.989
 series or film im now coming 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:17.380
 raimis as an executive producer or something 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:20.590
 involved we may be curious if 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:23.800
 that all without it so kempe 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.060
 works and the villa replaces one 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.680
 Woman I believe so I'm still something 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.560
 skeptical but as a trader was very much 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.600
 good and very hard out of there I am up 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.970
 in any case , the film is good 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.220
 every case a recommendation for all 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:40.169
 horrorfans do not want to know yet 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:47.639
 should do it quickly dancers 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:47.639
 level b1 well torture videos until then
