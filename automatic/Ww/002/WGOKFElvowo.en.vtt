good<00:00:09.120> evening<00:00:09.300> high<00:00:09.570> poverty<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.200> welcome<00:00:10.830> to

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
good evening high poverty and welcome to

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.470 
good evening high poverty and welcome to
another<00:00:11.010> video<00:00:11.370> in<00:00:11.730> tonight's<00:00:12.120> video<00:00:12.330> I

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
another video in tonight's video I

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.759 
another video in tonight's video I
thought<00:00:12.690> we'd<00:00:12.840> look<00:00:12.990> at<00:00:13.110> file<00:00:13.380> format

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
thought we'd look at file format

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.740 
thought we'd look at file format
exploits<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.610> we're<00:00:15.030> going<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.330> be<00:00:15.420> demoing

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
exploits and we're going to be demoing

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.800 
exploits and we're going to be demoing
VLC<00:00:16.320> real<00:00:16.619> text<00:00:17.070> which<00:00:18.000> is<00:00:18.029> an<00:00:18.210> old<00:00:18.359> exploit

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
VLC real text which is an old exploit

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.900 
VLC real text which is an old exploit
discovered<00:00:19.260> in<00:00:19.380> 2008<00:00:20.220> but<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:20.609> thought<00:00:20.789> it

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
discovered in 2008 but I thought it

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.220 
discovered in 2008 but I thought it
would<00:00:20.970> be<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.090> good<00:00:21.210> example<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.750> show<00:00:21.869> you<00:00:22.050> how

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
would be a good example to show you how

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.800 
would be a good example to show you how
file<00:00:22.560> format<00:00:22.980> exploits<00:00:23.460> work<00:00:23.699> so<00:00:24.660> the

the windows meterpreter payload as we've

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:46.069 
the windows meterpreter payload as we've
used<00:01:38.130> in<00:01:38.340> us<00:01:38.909> tutorials<00:01:43.579> and<00:01:44.869> we're<00:01:45.869> going<00:01:46.020> to

set the L host variable for this and

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.669 
set the L host variable for this and
double-check<00:01:54.509> we<00:01:54.659> have<00:01:54.810> all<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.020> our<00:01:55.229> settings

that we've got we just type exploits
this<00:02:02.670> will<00:02:02.939> generate<00:02:03.209> the<00:02:03.600> file<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.909> route

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
this will generate the file and route

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.069 
this will generate the file and route
MSF<00:02:07.200> for<00:02:07.500> local<00:02:08.130> and<00:02:08.509> whatever<00:02:09.509> you<00:02:09.599> call<00:02:09.869> the

MSF for local and whatever you call the
file<00:02:10.259> name<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:10.890> you'll<00:02:11.069> need<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.400> copy<00:02:11.579> this
