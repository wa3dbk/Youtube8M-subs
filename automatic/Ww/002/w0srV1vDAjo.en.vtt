health hazards of plastic water bottles

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.630 
health hazards of plastic water bottles
now<00:00:14.429> these<00:00:14.670> have<00:00:15.179> really<00:00:15.809> thrown<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.260> wrench<00:00:17.220> in

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
now these have really thrown a wrench in

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.359 
now these have really thrown a wrench in
things<00:00:17.699> so<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.359> speak<00:00:18.720> because<00:00:19.439> what<00:00:19.859> happens

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
things so to speak because what happens

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.500 
things so to speak because what happens
is<00:00:20.550> that<00:00:20.609> as<00:00:21.859> that<00:00:22.859> product<00:00:23.609> that<00:00:24.180> water

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
is that as that product that water

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.599 
is that as that product that water
bottle<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:25.140> shipped<00:00:25.470> wherever<00:00:26.099> it's<00:00:26.369> being

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
bottle is shipped wherever it's being

bottle is shipped wherever it's being
shipped<00:00:26.939> it<00:00:27.359> gets<00:00:27.630> hot<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.320> with<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.769> warmth

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
shipped it gets hot and with that warmth

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.990 
shipped it gets hot and with that warmth
plastic<00:00:30.689> molecules<00:00:31.320> leach<00:00:31.859> into<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.759> water

you go to drink your water and it tastes

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.290 
you go to drink your water and it tastes
like<00:00:42.780> plastic<00:00:43.460> that's<00:00:44.460> what's<00:00:44.789> going<00:00:45.030> on

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
like plastic that's what's going on

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.150 
like plastic that's what's going on
those<00:00:45.600> molecules<00:00:45.899> are<00:00:46.410> leaching<00:00:46.860> into<00:00:47.070> the

water with the heat facilitating that so
what<00:00:50.969> are<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.180> health<00:00:51.329> hazards<00:00:51.870> well<00:00:52.320> these

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
what are the health hazards well these

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.400 
what are the health hazards well these
particular<00:00:53.489> molecules<00:00:54.059> mimic<00:00:54.600> estrogens<00:00:55.260> in

particular molecules mimic estrogens in
the<00:00:55.559> body<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.270> what's<00:00:57.270> happening<00:00:57.780> in<00:00:57.870> our

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
the body and what's happening in our

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.490 
the body and what's happening in our
environment<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:59.000> a<00:01:00.109> proliferation<00:01:01.109> of

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
environment is a proliferation of

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.410 
environment is a proliferation of
something<00:01:01.829> called<00:01:02.010> xenoestrogens<00:01:02.460> meaning

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
something called xenoestrogens meaning

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.840 
something called xenoestrogens meaning
foreign<00:01:03.809> estrogens<00:01:04.549> estrogens<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.729> our

foreign estrogens estrogens that our

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.090 
foreign estrogens estrogens that our
bodies<00:01:06.150> aren't<00:01:06.330> making<00:01:06.600> but<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.650> are<00:01:07.770> in<00:01:07.920> the

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
bodies aren't making but that are in the

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.060 
bodies aren't making but that are in the
environment<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:09.060> it's<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.479> layering<00:01:10.070> it's

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
environment and it's a layering it's

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.399 
environment and it's a layering it's
just<00:01:11.340> giving<00:01:11.700> our<00:01:11.880> systems<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.510> certain<00:01:12.960> burden

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
just giving our systems a certain burden

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.890 
just giving our systems a certain burden
and<00:01:13.799> one<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.790> things<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.090> estrogen<00:01:15.659> does

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
and one of the things that estrogen does

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.170 
and one of the things that estrogen does
in<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.200> body<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.159> increases<00:01:17.700> cell

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
in the body is that it increases cell

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.570 
in the body is that it increases cell
proliferation<00:01:18.500> so<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.619> way<00:01:19.799> cells<00:01:20.159> are

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
proliferation so the way cells are

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.749 
proliferation so the way cells are
produced<00:01:20.880> by<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.360> body<00:01:21.479> increase<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.759> quite

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
produced by the body increase and quite

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.940 
produced by the body increase and quite
frankly<00:01:23.790> that's<00:01:24.780> not<00:01:25.080> something<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.740> we

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
frankly that's not something that we

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.219 
frankly that's not something that we
want<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:26.820> that's<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.540> main<00:01:27.869> health<00:01:28.770> hazard<00:01:29.369> of

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
want so that's the main health hazard of

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.350 
want so that's the main health hazard of
water<00:01:31.229> bottles<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.460> they<00:01:32.880> mimic<00:01:33.240> the

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
water bottles is that they mimic the

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.719 
water bottles is that they mimic the
estrogens<00:01:33.960> in<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.259> body<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.860> increase<00:01:35.520> our

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
estrogens in the body and increase our

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.179 
estrogens in the body and increase our
toxic<00:01:36.000> burden<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.810> mean<00:01:37.439> for<00:01:37.650> example<00:01:37.680> the

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
toxic burden I mean for example the

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.609 
toxic burden I mean for example the
liver<00:01:38.430> has<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:39.000> see<00:01:39.240> everything<00:01:39.600> going<00:01:40.140> into

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
liver has to see everything going into

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.710 
liver has to see everything going into
the<00:01:40.890> body<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:42.119> has<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.850> basically<00:01:44.850> d

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
the body and it has to basically d

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.350 
the body and it has to basically d
conjugate<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.619> strut<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.610> know<00:01:47.759> unstruck

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
conjugate and strut you know unstruck

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.210 
conjugate and strut you know unstruck
sure<00:01:48.509> all<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.960> these<00:01:49.110> hormones<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.710> come<00:01:50.040> in

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
sure all of these hormones that come in

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.700 
sure all of these hormones that come in
and<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:50.850> when<00:01:51.090> we<00:01:51.270> take<00:01:51.869> in<00:01:52.079> these<00:01:52.229> external

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
and so when we take in these external

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.039 
and so when we take in these external
hormones<00:01:53.340> in<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.610> form<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:54.060> plastic<00:01:54.750> it's

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
hormones in the form of plastic it's

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.620 
hormones in the form of plastic it's
really<00:01:55.860> clogging<00:01:56.579> up<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:57.500> body<00:01:58.500> so<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:58.920> speak

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
really clogging up the body so to speak

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.990 
really clogging up the body so to speak
and<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:01.380> would<00:02:01.560> be<00:02:01.710> my<00:02:01.920> my<00:02:02.250> biggest<00:02:02.610> concern

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
and that would be my my biggest concern

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.149 
and that would be my my biggest concern
about<00:02:03.030> these<00:02:03.450> bottles<00:02:04.040> physiologically<00:02:05.040> in

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
about these bottles physiologically in

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.609 
about these bottles physiologically in
addition<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.420> environmental<00:02:07.140> impact

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
addition to the environmental impact
