you're going to use a fine thread like
the<00:01:16.200> aurifil<00:01:16.619> thread<00:01:16.650> because<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.640> nice

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.469 
up your machine and when you pee small
you<00:01:22.380> want<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.650> find<00:01:22.920> thread<00:01:23.369> because<00:01:24.030> actually

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
you want to find thread because actually

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.420 
you want to find thread because actually
thread<00:01:24.840> takes<00:01:25.320> up<00:01:25.470> thickness<00:01:25.830> in<00:01:26.040> your<00:01:26.189> seam

thread takes up thickness in your seam

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.370 
thread takes up thickness in your seam

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
so the finer the thread the nicer it is

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.050 
so the finer the thread the nicer it is
and<00:01:28.650> then<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.009> also<00:01:29.189> want<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.520> talk<00:01:29.670> about<00:01:29.729> the

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.810 
length that should just almost per frame
just<00:03:57.090> a<00:03:57.180> quick<00:03:57.420> little<00:03:57.630> tear<00:03:58.670> removing<00:03:59.670> the

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
just a quick little tear removing the

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:06.530 
just a quick little tear removing the
paper

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.289 

now<00:04:07.439> the<00:04:07.500> next<00:04:07.890> step<00:04:08.040> is<00:04:08.069> to<00:04:08.459> piece<00:04:08.670> the<00:04:08.909> units

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
now the next step is to piece the units

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.050 
now the next step is to piece the units
together<00:04:09.629> and<00:04:09.900> I<00:04:10.200> have<00:04:10.470> done<00:04:10.709> so<00:04:10.980> already<00:04:11.060> to

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
together and I have done so already to

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.899 
together and I have done so already to
save<00:04:12.269> some<00:04:12.510> time<00:04:12.540> so<00:04:13.170> I<00:04:13.439> do<00:04:13.680> not<00:04:14.099> pin<00:04:14.640> these

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:14.909 
save some time so I do not pin these

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:16.879 
save some time so I do not pin these
little<00:04:15.299> units<00:04:15.659> together<00:04:15.870> when<00:04:16.350> I<00:04:16.380> run<00:04:16.709> them

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
little units together when I run them

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.740 
little units together when I run them
through<00:04:16.919> the<00:04:17.190> machine<00:04:17.549> as<00:04:17.699> they<00:04:18.209> are<00:04:18.359> really

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
through the machine as they are really

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.430 
through the machine as they are really
nice<00:04:18.959> and<00:04:19.019> stiff<00:04:19.590> and<00:04:19.949> so<00:04:20.699> tiny<00:04:21.030> that<00:04:21.350> but<00:04:22.350> if

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
nice and stiff and so tiny that but if

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.870 
nice and stiff and so tiny that but if
you<00:04:22.560> want<00:04:22.800> you<00:04:22.979> can<00:04:23.130> throw<00:04:23.280> a<00:04:23.400> little<00:04:23.610> paint<00:04:23.789> in

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
you want you can throw a little paint in

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.790 
you want you can throw a little paint in
there<00:04:24.060> but<00:04:24.240> to<00:04:24.510> me<00:04:24.600> that<00:04:24.630> just<00:04:24.960> takes<00:04:25.139> time

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
there but to me that just takes time

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.680 
there but to me that just takes time
that<00:04:25.860> I<00:04:26.070> don't<00:04:26.310> want<00:04:26.460> to<00:04:26.580> waste<00:04:26.760> so<00:04:27.360> I<00:04:27.389> ran

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
that I don't want to waste so I ran

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.600 
that I don't want to waste so I ran
those<00:04:27.930> all<00:04:28.289> through<00:04:28.560> the<00:04:28.650> machine<00:04:28.979> and<00:04:29.190> now<00:04:29.580> I

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
those all through the machine and now I

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.490 
those all through the machine and now I
want<00:04:29.880> to<00:04:30.000> press<00:04:30.240> all<00:04:30.510> the<00:04:30.750> quarter-inch<00:04:31.080> seams

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
want to press all the quarter-inch seams

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.900 
want to press all the quarter-inch seams
open<00:04:31.710> so<00:04:32.699> lay<00:04:32.910> that<00:04:33.150> down<00:04:33.479> I<00:04:34.550> use<00:04:35.550> my<00:04:35.729> little

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
open so lay that down I use my little

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.210 
open so lay that down I use my little
finger<00:04:36.030> tip<00:04:36.539> a<00:04:36.660> little<00:04:36.780> bit<00:04:36.930> and<00:04:37.289> I<00:04:37.800> just<00:04:38.010> put

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
finger tip a little bit and I just put

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:44.000 
finger tip a little bit and I just put
one<00:04:38.250> little<00:04:38.580> finger<00:04:39.060> in<00:04:39.270> there<00:04:39.600> and<00:04:42.800> give<00:04:43.800> it<00:04:43.830> a

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
one little finger in there and give it a

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.670 
one little finger in there and give it a
blast<00:04:44.220> of<00:04:44.610> steam<00:04:45.050> and<00:04:46.050> hopefully<00:04:46.440> it<00:04:46.560> comes

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
blast of steam and hopefully it comes

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:58.040 
blast of steam and hopefully it comes
out

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.830 

there<00:04:59.050> we<00:04:59.290> go<00:04:59.760> and<00:05:00.760> as<00:05:00.910> you<00:05:01.060> can<00:05:01.210> see<00:05:01.270> it's<00:05:01.630> not

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
there we go and as you can see it's not

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:08.430 
there we go and as you can see it's not
that<00:05:01.900> easy<00:05:06.750> get<00:05:07.750> them<00:05:07.870> all<00:05:07.960> going<00:05:08.170> in<00:05:08.350> the

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
that easy get them all going in the

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.390 
that easy get them all going in the
right<00:05:08.590> direction<00:05:10.530> after<00:05:11.530> our<00:05:11.920> seams<00:05:12.190> are

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
right direction after our seams are

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.120 
right direction after our seams are
pressed<00:05:12.430> open<00:05:12.940> it's<00:05:13.390> time<00:05:13.720> to<00:05:14.020> pin<00:05:14.560> this<00:05:14.740> unit

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
pressed open it's time to pin this unit

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.180 
pressed open it's time to pin this unit
to<00:05:15.280> another<00:05:15.630> fabric<00:05:16.630> right<00:05:17.020> sides<00:05:17.350> together<00:05:17.590> I

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
to another fabric right sides together I

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
to another fabric right sides together I
take<00:05:18.850> my<00:05:19.060> pins<00:05:19.390> and<00:05:19.750> place<00:05:20.290> them<00:05:20.770> on<00:05:21.550> each<00:05:21.610> end

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
take my pins and place them on each end

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.870 
take my pins and place them on each end
but<00:05:22.720> I<00:05:22.750> see<00:05:23.140> how<00:05:23.320> I<00:05:23.350> come<00:05:23.740> back<00:05:23.950> just<00:05:24.460> in<00:05:24.640> the

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
but I see how I come back just in the

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.910 
but I see how I come back just in the
quarter<00:05:25.240> inch<00:05:25.420> I'm<00:05:25.780> not<00:05:26.380> going<00:05:26.560> to<00:05:26.620> remove

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:26.920 
quarter inch I'm not going to remove

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.910 
quarter inch I'm not going to remove
these<00:05:27.130> pins<00:05:27.460> when<00:05:27.700> I<00:05:27.730> stitch<00:05:28.440> that<00:05:29.440> takes<00:05:29.710> too

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:29.920 
these pins when I stitch that takes too

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.490 
these pins when I stitch that takes too
much<00:05:30.040> time<00:05:30.510> so<00:05:31.510> as<00:05:31.690> I<00:05:31.840> run<00:05:32.050> this<00:05:32.080> through<00:05:32.470> my

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
much time so as I run this through my

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.180 
much time so as I run this through my
machine<00:05:32.770> I'm<00:05:33.250> going<00:05:33.880> to<00:05:33.940> miss<00:05:34.120> those<00:05:34.300> pins<00:05:34.660> and

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
machine I'm going to miss those pins and

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:49.640 
machine I'm going to miss those pins and
do<00:05:36.190> a<00:05:36.220> perfect<00:05:36.970> scene

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.710
