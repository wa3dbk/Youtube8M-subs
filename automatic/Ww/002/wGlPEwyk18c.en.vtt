tell me that I kid calling a little more
than<00:00:05.819> a<00:00:06.180> cover<00:00:06.509> girl

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.330 

see<00:00:24.400> as<00:00:24.520> you<00:00:24.700> can<00:00:24.850> see<00:00:25.029> I<00:00:25.060> hit<00:00:25.270> my<00:00:25.390> numbers<00:00:26.340> sort

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340 
see as you can see I hit my numbers sort

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.010 
see as you can see I hit my numbers sort
of<00:00:27.430> make<00:00:27.520> a<00:00:27.550> few<00:00:27.820> more<00:00:27.970> points<00:00:28.210> about<00:00:28.689> if<00:00:28.869> it

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.020 
of make a few more points about if it

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.119 
of make a few more points about if it
fits<00:00:29.230> your<00:00:29.410> macros<00:00:31.590> one<00:00:32.590> of<00:00:32.650> the<00:00:32.710> thing<00:00:32.860> is<00:00:32.890> we

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:33.129 
fits your macros one of the thing is we

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:34.860 
fits your macros one of the thing is we
don't<00:00:33.280> really<00:00:33.640> I<00:00:33.790> don't<00:00:33.850> really<00:00:34.059> follow<00:00:34.390> if<00:00:34.720> it

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
don't really I don't really follow if it

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.040 
don't really I don't really follow if it
fits<00:00:35.140> your<00:00:35.320> macros<00:00:35.670> what<00:00:36.670> I<00:00:36.879> think<00:00:37.420> that

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
fits your macros what I think that

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.080 
fits your macros what I think that
should<00:00:38.290> be<00:00:38.350> changed<00:00:38.980> to<00:00:39.160> and<00:00:39.580> it<00:00:39.790> wouldn't<00:00:39.940> be

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.090 
should be changed to and it wouldn't be

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.630 
should be changed to and it wouldn't be
as<00:00:40.180> catchy<00:00:40.449> is<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:41.920> I<00:00:42.580> FY<00:00:43.590> MMF<00:00:44.590> so<00:00:45.010> the<00:00:45.160> moment<00:00:45.430> is

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
as catchy is I I FY MMF so the moment is

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.020 
as catchy is I I FY MMF so the moment is
iifym<00:00:46.800> but<00:00:47.800> really<00:00:48.100> it's<00:00:48.220> if<00:00:48.400> it<00:00:48.580> fits<00:00:48.850> your

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
iifym but really it's if it fits your

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.819 
iifym but really it's if it fits your
macros<00:00:49.739> micros<00:00:50.739> and<00:00:50.980> fire<00:00:51.760> by<00:00:51.970> targets<00:00:52.829> you

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
macros micros and fire by targets you

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.319 
macros micros and fire by targets you
can<00:00:53.980> hit<00:00:54.100> all<00:00:54.160> of<00:00:54.309> those<00:00:54.579> goals<00:00:56.760> then<00:00:57.760> you<00:00:58.059> can

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
can hit all of those goals then you can

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.900 
can hit all of those goals then you can
pretty<00:00:58.629> much<00:00:58.750> you<00:00:59.710> can<00:00:59.890> be<00:01:00.039> robotic<00:01:00.550> about<00:01:00.789> the

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
pretty much you can be robotic about the

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.670 
pretty much you can be robotic about the
whole<00:01:01.059> thing<00:01:01.090> all<00:01:01.629> you<00:01:01.809> need<00:01:01.989> to<00:01:02.020> do<00:01:02.320> is<00:01:02.350> hit

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
whole thing all you need to do is hit

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.670 
whole thing all you need to do is hit
numbers<00:01:03.129> just<00:01:04.000> focus<00:01:04.600> on<00:01:04.780> the<00:01:04.960> numbers<00:01:05.410> yeah

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
numbers just focus on the numbers yeah

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.950 
numbers just focus on the numbers yeah
you've<00:01:05.860> got<00:01:05.890> a<00:01:06.100> target<00:01:06.399> once<00:01:07.270> you<00:01:07.720> know<00:01:07.840> the

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
you've got a target once you know the

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.480 
you've got a target once you know the
reason<00:01:08.170> I've<00:01:08.259> got<00:01:08.410> a<00:01:08.440> coach<00:01:08.680> is<00:01:09.039> so<00:01:09.250> that<00:01:09.399> we

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
reason I've got a coach is so that we

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.730 
reason I've got a coach is so that we
can<00:01:09.670> figure<00:01:09.880> out<00:01:10.000> my<00:01:10.360> exact<00:01:10.720> numbers<00:01:11.140> once<00:01:11.619> you

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
can figure out my exact numbers once you

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.050 
can figure out my exact numbers once you
hit<00:01:11.890> that<00:01:12.070> magic<00:01:12.310> sweet<00:01:12.850> spot

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
hit that magic sweet spot

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.600 
hit that magic sweet spot
once<00:01:14.570> you<00:01:14.750> hit<00:01:14.869> the<00:01:15.110> you<00:01:16.040> know<00:01:16.159> once<00:01:16.340> you<00:01:16.460> hit

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
once you hit the you know once you hit

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.819 
once you hit the you know once you hit
your<00:01:16.790> numbers<00:01:17.270> and<00:01:17.450> they're<00:01:18.320> right<00:01:18.500> for<00:01:18.530> your

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:18.829 
your numbers and they're right for your

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:22.539 
your numbers and they're right for your
body<00:01:19.210> then<00:01:20.210> you<00:01:21.140> can<00:01:21.380> you<00:01:22.009> can<00:01:22.220> put<00:01:22.399> whatever

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
body then you can you can put whatever

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.120 
body then you can you can put whatever
foods<00:01:23.090> you<00:01:23.360> want<00:01:23.390> to<00:01:23.780> make<00:01:24.020> up<00:01:24.289> those<00:01:24.500> numbers

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
foods you want to make up those numbers

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.160 
foods you want to make up those numbers
the<00:01:25.520> great<00:01:25.789> thing<00:01:25.820> about<00:01:26.299> science<00:01:26.750> is<00:01:27.110> that

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
the great thing about science is that

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.139 
the great thing about science is that
has<00:01:27.560> actually<00:01:27.740> made<00:01:28.549> things<00:01:28.729> a<00:01:28.880> lot<00:01:29.000> easier

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
has actually made things a lot easier

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:32.440 
has actually made things a lot easier
for<00:01:29.600> us<00:01:30.070> it's<00:01:31.070> it's<00:01:31.429> made<00:01:31.729> us<00:01:31.880> realize<00:01:32.240> that<00:01:32.270> we

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
for us it's it's made us realize that we

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.520 
for us it's it's made us realize that we
were<00:01:32.600> making<00:01:33.020> things<00:01:33.229> a<00:01:33.289> lot<00:01:33.409> more

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
were making things a lot more

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.160 
were making things a lot more
complicated<00:01:33.979> with<00:01:34.520> our<00:01:34.700> you<00:01:35.420> know<00:01:35.450> six<00:01:36.020> to

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
complicated with our you know six to

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.560 
complicated with our you know six to
eight<00:01:36.350> meals<00:01:36.619> a<00:01:36.799> day<00:01:37.880> with<00:01:38.090> you<00:01:38.420> know

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
eight meals a day with you know

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.380 
eight meals a day with you know
eat<00:01:39.110> every<00:01:39.470> two<00:01:39.740> to<00:01:39.770> three<00:01:39.950> hours

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
eat every two to three hours

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.660 
eat every two to three hours
again<00:01:41.920> you<00:01:42.920> know<00:01:43.009> don't<00:01:43.159> get<00:01:43.280> me<00:01:43.340> wrong<00:01:43.520> if<00:01:43.640> you

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
again you know don't get me wrong if you

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.719

choose<00:01:44.000> to<00:01:44.210> do<00:01:44.390> that<00:01:45.009> that's<00:01:46.009> fine<00:01:46.340> i<00:01:46.369> get

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
choose to do that that's fine i get

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.570 
choose to do that that's fine i get
about<00:01:46.819> four<00:01:47.179> to<00:01:47.330> five<00:01:47.360> meals<00:01:47.840> a<00:01:48.170> day<00:01:48.200> in<00:01:48.709> that's

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
me to stick to a dire as such and I

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.930 
me to stick to a dire as such and I
think<00:04:18.420> if<00:04:19.109> everybody<00:04:19.440> got<00:04:19.709> got<00:04:20.519> the<00:04:20.549> hang<00:04:20.910> of

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
think if everybody got got the hang of

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.060 
think if everybody got got the hang of
tracking<00:04:21.870> everything<00:04:22.230> that<00:04:22.470> goes<00:04:22.590> into<00:04:22.830> their

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
tracking everything that goes into their

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.520 
tracking everything that goes into their
mouth<00:04:23.340> I<00:04:23.610> think<00:04:24.060> everyone<00:04:24.390> else<00:04:24.540> in<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:25.260> world

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
mouth I think everyone else in the world

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.970 
mouth I think everyone else in the world
would<00:04:26.900> would<00:04:27.900> be<00:04:27.930> able<00:04:28.260> to<00:04:28.350> get<00:04:28.530> the<00:04:28.650> results

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
would would be able to get the results

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.680 
would would be able to get the results
they<00:04:29.040> want<00:04:29.400> I<00:04:29.520> think<00:04:29.790> most<00:04:30.000> people<00:04:30.330> don't<00:04:30.510> ever

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690

average Joe here I think most people
don't<00:04:34.260> get<00:04:34.440> started<00:04:35.040> because<00:04:35.600> they<00:04:36.600> think

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
don't get started because they think

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.000 
don't get started because they think

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
five minutes a day is all it would take

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.770 
five minutes a day is all it would take
