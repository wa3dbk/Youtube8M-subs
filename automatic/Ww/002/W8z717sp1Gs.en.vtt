00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:07.000
 hello this is my first tutorial and I 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.420
 I'm going to teach some programs that 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.720
 I found to Alós 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:16.939
 good one of these is this 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:20.580
 they dress as they see it as feeling 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:22.529
 very well this program allows you to 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.340
 impose the keys correctly 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.340
 impossible I know 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:33.230
 we are going to remove them 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:35.329
 here is a point 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.940
 you when you enter the game of 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:42.699
 aluce first they have to enter to 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:48.339
 pay I have to put here where they see 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:51.410
 right here in active actívate page and 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:54.110
 after putting that you put the 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:58.309
 button that is below escape and you 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.260
 will get a few blue lettering those 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.570
 blue letters and you are going to put 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.000
 any keys already beat them some 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.680
 of the keys that I have but for this 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.259
 I can not go into halo because 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.990
 I got stuck with the tutorial so spears 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:14.740
 things 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:18.520
 once activated this did not tell me and 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:21.250
 normally like this so that it is left 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.360
 been more that's not so important very 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.740
 all right 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.860
 first I'm going to show you the link of the 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:31.130
 page to download 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.580
 They can only be downloaded only in this 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.580
 page 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:40.110
 and point 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.830
 halo maps 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.830
 point 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:51.240
 on this page you can download 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:55.470
 maps all applications for ALO 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.470
 I'm going to show you with this list 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:04.570
 as you see here is on the page you 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.340
 can of all the options put in the 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:11.030
 second with the maps 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.900
 here very well it gives you a click 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.900
 and we wait 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.680
 very well after this they will come out 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.530
 several maps down here all the 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.620
 that you can what you can catch and 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.300
 download them but we are not going to 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.810
 download those that will be for later 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.530
 very good here is on the menu and just 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.630
 below the menu comes out this search 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.000
 here right down we will come out that 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.580
 search and this is where you are going to 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.160
 look for what they want so here you can 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.170
 search maps but we can carlos 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.890
 after that they told us in the next 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.510
 tutorial very well then in this les 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.190
 I'm going to show you how to download the 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:01.800
 programs for example this is the halo it 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:06.710
 must unveiled it 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.710
 of développement trainer 2 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.680
 from the blog 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.680
 and 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.960
 very well is either of these two 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.760
 applications that you have to 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.650
 click 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.829
 for example here are many maps that 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:48.120
 match the name of the program and 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:50.730
 once downloaded that that program is 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:54.090
 very good I recommend you leave me 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.620
 I did not have to look for him here 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.280
 because I have it installed 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.280
 or not 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.830
 where is 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:13.319
 when you download them you are going to 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:20.790
 appear a rar file like this 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:23.870
 compress and extend here the 3 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.870
 and it will appear 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.240
 the following appears a folder with the 

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:32.330
 name of the file will seem to 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:36.409
 just a file that is going to be this the 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:40.129
 halo you see him I do not have trainer 2 this is going 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:43.759
 to be a double click they give the first one in 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:46.550
 work they open this file and then 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:50.000
 in activate after giving it to activate 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:52.629
 you put what under the exhaust 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.629
 you put 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:05:00.460
 the escape work blue letters 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.960
 you can put can put any of 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:06.290
 these keys below 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.740
 Seattle is player one is for 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:12.670
 immortality 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:14.620
 If the vehicle is to disappear 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:17.190
 I hope that all the 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.190
 vehicles 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.560
 and 7 eggs is for all of them to appear 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:26.530
 the weapons and so on are 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:29.770
 all of these can also find them 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:33.300
 in google as keys for those in the 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.300
 console and nothing else 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:39.349
 good 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:42.199
 good as I will have it like this 

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:43.550
 program that is the camp study 6 is very 

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:47.180
 well I recommend you 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:49.020
 canning but good now let's go to what 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:52.020
 what 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:54.360
 what I already taught them but they have to 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.759
 find you have to fight up 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.129
 find this page because it's not a 

00:05:56.759 --> 00:06:01.740
 little like that but I'm going to give you looking 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:03.660
 maybe this also place carlos the 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:06.430
 trainer 3 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:09.870
 one is also 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.870
 for example here we click 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.450
 in this file this is the one that should 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:22.090
 download here the whole number of my great 

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:24.790
 absolutely everything is in doubles 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:29.500
 after two the 30 disappear 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:31.000
 seconds I do not see them very well 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.350
 after giving you all the plans 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.350
 seconds and it's going to start from 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:38.370
 compressed files save that is like 

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:41.000
 that it was like this one that taught them 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.000
 like this 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:46.020
 very well I think that has been all but 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:49.730
 decompress the active and put the 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.730
 good tricks that's all
