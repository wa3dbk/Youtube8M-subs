00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.540
 amber hens are honored here i'm the one of his 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.350
 the goldsmith and the core city use Herrmann Mittendrein twice 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:11.950
 everything you have here on my website 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.779
 my facebook page or how to find your own books is mine 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:17.849
 all are unique 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:20.119
 there is only one of Vienna in the world 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.039
 then of course they are not 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.990
 Percent not collected by me but from three to four 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.249
 People on the coast 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:27.609
 the premium Aussie woman 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:28.320
 and this is 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.859
 how can it be done that way 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:33.120
 If quite a lot of admonishing jewelry you will find on Tine black stone 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.070
 as well as my own followers 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.350
 this is a stone called Chet 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.150
 called Helgard in Germany 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.360
 Percent if you look a little bit at this cut-off area 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.230
 you recognize the annual rings as a testimony that he will someday be a tree 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.160
 must have been 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.990
 we have to get back from the time of the big dinosaurs before 80 million 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.100
 Years ago this stone stood as a tree on the surface of the earth 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.270
 The trees were later extinct due to the upset percent and then ended 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.229
 later in percent deep in the earth 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:07.450
 where they are under enormous pressure and temperature 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.539
 They are this witty stone here that transforms a coal at once 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:14.060
 is equal but also a rise 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.890
 Every stone was raised by 98 percent without stopping 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.140
 So almost a diamond 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.030
 the amount of carbon makes it unlikely 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.580
 and stepped this ease brings him here to Denmark after he left 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.590
 the English coast became the fpÃ¶ 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.670
 Percent he is simply being played at percent off OTE shoreline and we can 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.330
 him often because of his adverse weights 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.330
 go collect amber at the same time 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.610
 they come here painting workshop 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.150
 I'm looking at an amber now and very nice 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.060
 underneath 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.070
 but inside some connections found inclusions and therefore want 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.340
 I do not use them for jewelry as there is always Minit Museum 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.080
 happens here a few percent I have quite a lot of machines yearly 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.479
 Parma I fall I also have prophet LED technology 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.810
 Percent for example 19 c Frese 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.040
 Percent leads the club not for Klaus the direction of silver 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.029
 the stones were able to do 

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:14.029
 Do not worry much about my ambers 

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:16.459
 Silver around one 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.299
 Percent by percent 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.299
 a lot of different designs for all percent 

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:26.479
 classic design are also very quickly announced special highlights of his 

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:29.919
 other surfaces than you normally know 

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:30.799
 otherwise 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.939
 Mach is polished here polished 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:36.389
 which forged the popular one 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.309
 and so on and of course I have 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:41.029
 special people for every purpose
