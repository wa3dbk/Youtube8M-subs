hard<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.119> bend<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.390> but<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.079> gonna<00:01:34.710> protect<00:01:34.920> a

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
hard to bend that but is gonna protect a

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.530 
hard to bend that but is gonna protect a
phone<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.640> I'm<00:01:35.759> not<00:01:35.909> just<00:01:36.119> saying<00:01:36.240> that

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
phone and I'm not just saying that

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.179 
phone and I'm not just saying that
it<00:01:36.780> looks<00:01:36.960> really<00:01:37.290> thin<00:01:37.500> as<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:37.920> can<00:01:38.040> see

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
it looks really thin as you can see

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.749 
it looks really thin as you can see
really<00:01:38.610> thin<00:01:38.820> foam<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.470> is<00:01:40.470> just<00:01:40.729> well<00:01:41.729> I

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
really thin foam and that is just well I

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.399 
really thin foam and that is just well I
thought<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.150> levitates<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.020> phone<00:01:43.170> from

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
thought that levitates the phone from

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.280 
thought that levitates the phone from
the<00:01:43.590> from<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.640> back<00:01:44.790> plastic<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.049> case

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
the from the back plastic of the case

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.170 
the from the back plastic of the case
which<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.950> machine<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.579> done<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:47.850> stop

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
which is a machine that done that stop

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.399 
which is a machine that done that stop
scratching<00:01:48.390> not<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:48.990> plastic<00:01:49.259> will

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
scratching not that the plastic will

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.590 
scratching not that the plastic will
scratch<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.829> but<00:01:50.009> there<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:50.640> cutouts<00:01:51.090> here<00:01:51.329> for

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
scratch it but there is cutouts here for

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.480 
scratch it but there is cutouts here for
the<00:01:51.750> headphone<00:01:52.110> jack<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.070> Lightning

the headphone jack and the Lightning

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.859 
the headphone jack and the Lightning
port<00:01:53.670> not<00:01:54.000> necessarily<00:01:54.420> because<00:01:54.540> how<00:01:54.720> it's

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
port not necessarily because how it's

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.410

Mini in my pocket

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.150 
Mini in my pocket
depending<00:03:43.080> on<00:03:43.170> what<00:03:43.290> jeans<00:03:43.560> I'm<00:03:43.739> wearing<00:03:43.769> but

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
so I'm hoping that the iPhone 6 plus

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.080 
so I'm hoping that the iPhone 6 plus
shouldn't<00:03:48.780> be<00:03:48.840> too<00:03:49.019> much<00:03:49.110> of<00:03:49.170> a<00:03:49.350> big<00:03:49.500> deal

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
shouldn't be too much of a big deal

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.820 
shouldn't be too much of a big deal
it's<00:03:51.090> not<00:03:51.299> as<00:03:51.420> wide<00:03:51.630> but<00:03:51.989> it's<00:03:52.110> quite<00:03:52.650> this

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
it's not as wide but it's quite this

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.030 
it's not as wide but it's quite this
almost<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.370> same<00:03:53.760> sort<00:03:54.299> of<00:03:54.330> tallness<00:03:54.810> as<00:03:55.200> the

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
almost the same sort of tallness as the

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.940 
almost the same sort of tallness as the
ipad<00:03:56.549> so<00:03:57.120> yeah<00:03:57.600> it's<00:03:57.900> it's<00:03:58.110> huge<00:03:58.380> pretty<00:03:58.799> much

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
ipad so yeah it's it's huge pretty much

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.170 
ipad so yeah it's it's huge pretty much
as<00:03:59.130> what<00:03:59.220> I'm<00:03:59.310> trying<00:03:59.489> to<00:03:59.519> say<00:03:59.700> put<00:03:59.910> that<00:04:00.090> to

as what I'm trying to say put that to

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.199 
as what I'm trying to say put that to
one<00:04:00.299> side<00:04:00.360> for<00:04:00.570> a<00:04:00.750> second<00:04:01.080> this<00:04:01.650> is<00:04:01.950> the<00:04:02.640> iPhone

one side for a second this is the iPhone
5c<00:04:04.140> if<00:04:04.380> we<00:04:04.920> just<00:04:05.070> place<00:04:05.340> that<00:04:05.370> inside<00:04:06.030> the

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
5c if we just place that inside the

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.180 
5c if we just place that inside the
phone<00:04:06.360> here<00:04:06.600> in<00:04:06.660> the<00:04:06.720> bottom<00:04:06.870> corner<00:04:07.040> as<00:04:08.040> you

phone here in the bottom corner as you
can<00:04:08.310> see<00:04:08.489> it's<00:04:08.820> reasonably<00:04:09.810> bigger<00:04:10.049> than<00:04:10.440> the

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
can see it's reasonably bigger than the

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.650 
can see it's reasonably bigger than the
iPhone<00:04:11.130> 6<00:04:11.400> that<00:04:11.549> is<00:04:11.670> quite<00:04:11.940> baffling<00:04:12.360> to<00:04:12.510> see

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
iPhone 6 that is quite baffling to see

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.840 
iPhone 6 that is quite baffling to see
that<00:04:12.840> that<00:04:13.260> is<00:04:13.320> the<00:04:13.440> screen<00:04:13.799> size<00:04:13.830> of<00:04:14.489> the

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.810 
phone that I'm currently using and just
to<00:04:17.310> think<00:04:17.519> that<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:17.790> screen<00:04:18.030> size<00:04:18.269> of<00:04:18.389> my<00:04:18.480> neck

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
to think that the screen size of my neck

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.630 
to think that the screen size of my neck
he's<00:04:19.000> gonna<00:04:19.120> be<00:04:19.270> that<00:04:19.420> slow<00:04:19.630> sighs<00:04:20.520> I'm<00:04:21.520> a

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
he's gonna be that slow sighs I'm a

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.610 
he's gonna be that slow sighs I'm a
little<00:04:21.820> bit<00:04:21.940> skeptical<00:04:22.210> actually<00:04:22.630> starting

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
little bit skeptical actually starting

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.990 
little bit skeptical actually starting
to<00:04:23.650> get<00:04:23.770> a<00:04:23.830> little<00:04:23.950> bit<00:04:24.160> worried<00:04:24.430> it's<00:04:24.670> huge

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
to get a little bit worried it's huge

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.670 
to get a little bit worried it's huge
it's<00:04:25.300> really<00:04:25.660> big<00:04:25.840> and<00:04:26.080> it's<00:04:26.380> gonna<00:04:26.500> probably

be even more worrying comparing it to
