really makes me smile the most because
it<00:01:56.310> achieved<00:01:56.700> exactly<00:01:56.969> what<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.570> application

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
it achieved exactly what the application

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:00.050 
it achieved exactly what the application

never<00:02:33.120> thought<00:02:33.570> that<00:02:33.750> this<00:02:33.930> application

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
never thought that this application

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.710 
never thought that this application
would<00:02:34.770> get<00:02:35.670> barely<00:02:36.090> over<00:02:36.210> a<00:02:36.330> hundred

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
would get barely over a hundred

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.010 
would get barely over a hundred
downloads<00:02:37.260> or<00:02:37.500> 150<00:02:38.190> so<00:02:38.760> it's<00:02:39.120> a<00:02:39.240> big<00:02:39.450> funky<00:02:39.870> to

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.300 
bow of the VG j youtube channel resource
and<00:03:16.230> it<00:03:16.320> looks<00:03:16.470> as<00:03:16.530> if<00:03:16.650> people<00:03:16.920> using<00:03:17.250> it

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310

although<00:03:17.610> i'm<00:03:17.820> not<00:03:17.880> sure<00:03:18.360> how<00:03:18.510> somebody's

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
although i'm not sure how somebody's

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.650 
although i'm not sure how somebody's
downloaded<00:03:19.380> it<00:03:19.500> for<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:19.830> apple<00:03:20.660> software

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
downloaded it for the apple software

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.210 
downloaded it for the apple software
because<00:03:22.050> it's<00:03:22.200> not<00:03:22.350> even<00:03:22.560> available<00:03:22.650> on

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
because it's not even available on

because it's not even available on
iphones<00:03:23.730> or<00:03:23.850> ipods<00:03:24.180> so<00:03:24.270> that's<00:03:24.510> a<00:03:24.630> miracle<00:03:24.930> in

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.600 
set up many different feeds and that's
generally<00:03:55.410> how<00:03:55.440> the<00:03:55.590> application<00:03:55.739> works<00:03:56.310> very

generally how the application works very

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.190 
generally how the application works very
easy<00:03:56.880> to<00:03:57.090> use<00:03:57.120> doesn't<00:03:57.540> require<00:03:57.750> any<00:03:58.110> coding

absolutely none and as you can see this
is<00:04:03.180> what<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:03.570> application<00:04:03.690> looks<00:04:04.290> like<00:04:04.500> on<00:04:04.709> a

is what the application looks like on a

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.860 
is what the application looks like on a
smartphone<00:04:05.100> so<00:04:05.880> you<00:04:05.940> can<00:04:06.090> just<00:04:06.120> navigate<00:04:06.390> up

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
minute when I stop messing about on this

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.440 
minute when I stop messing about on this
page<00:04:17.310> I<00:04:17.549> will<00:04:17.790> show<00:04:17.970> you<00:04:18.060> what<00:04:18.150> it<00:04:18.269> looks<00:04:18.299> like

on a tablet this is an iPad

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.710 
on a tablet this is an iPad
demonstration<00:04:20.609> but<00:04:20.700> it<00:04:20.820> looks<00:04:20.970> identical<00:04:21.180> on

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
demonstration but it looks identical on

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.990 
demonstration but it looks identical on
a<00:04:21.750> tablet<00:04:22.200> so<00:04:22.860> then<00:04:23.400> you<00:04:23.520> can<00:04:23.669> actually<00:04:23.789> see
