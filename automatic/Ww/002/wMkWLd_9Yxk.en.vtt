00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
lot more fun and it basically involves

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:29.629 
lot more fun and it basically involves
you<00:02:28.290> flying<00:02:28.590> through<00:02:28.859> a<00:02:28.889> series<00:02:29.249> of<00:02:29.370> gates

you flying through a series of gates
within<00:02:30.239> a<00:02:30.420> time<00:02:30.629> limit<00:02:30.659> as<00:02:31.049> quickly<00:02:31.290> as

within a time limit as quickly as

within a time limit as quickly as
possible<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:32.010> it<00:02:32.129> works<00:02:32.310> really<00:02:32.519> well<00:02:32.639> the

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
possible and it works really well the

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.849 
possible and it works really well the
controls<00:02:33.359> respond<00:02:33.780> nicely<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.500> can<00:02:34.620> clearly

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:34.859 
controls respond nicely you can clearly

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:36.830 
controls respond nicely you can clearly
see<00:02:35.159> which<00:02:35.370> gates<00:02:35.639> coming<00:02:36.000> up<00:02:36.090> next<00:02:36.329> and<00:02:36.689> when

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
see which gates coming up next and when

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.240 
see which gates coming up next and when
they're<00:02:37.019> not<00:02:37.139> on<00:02:37.260> screen<00:02:37.590> a<00:02:37.620> little<00:02:37.769> arrow

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
they're not on screen a little arrow

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.039 
they're not on screen a little arrow
indicates<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.150> direction<00:02:39.299> you<00:02:39.629> need<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:39.900> move

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
indicates the direction you need to move

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.750 
indicates the direction you need to move
in<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:40.349> it's<00:02:40.680> definitely<00:02:40.919> more<00:02:41.129> fun<00:02:41.189> than<00:02:41.609> the

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
in and it's definitely more fun than the

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.250 
in and it's definitely more fun than the
straight<00:02:42.090> combat<00:02:42.510> when<00:02:42.749> you're<00:02:42.930> controlling

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
straight combat when you're controlling

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.050 
straight combat when you're controlling
the<00:02:43.439> ship<00:02:43.620> so<00:02:43.950> next<00:02:44.129> we<00:02:44.340> have<00:02:44.489> the<00:02:44.549> puzzle

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
the ship so next we have the puzzle

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.670 
the ship so next we have the puzzle
solving<00:02:45.419> element<00:02:45.780> of<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.019> game<00:02:46.200> and<00:02:46.409> this

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
solving element of the game and this

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.009 
solving element of the game and this
again<00:02:47.010> is<00:02:47.280> divided<00:02:47.849> into<00:02:48.120> two<00:02:48.599> distinct

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
again is divided into two distinct

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.780 
again is divided into two distinct
styles<00:02:49.349> of<00:02:49.439> gameplay<00:02:49.769> the<00:02:50.159> first<00:02:50.400> you'll<00:02:50.639> come

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
styles of gameplay the first you'll come

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.339 
styles of gameplay the first you'll come
across<00:02:50.879> almost<00:02:51.299> immediately<00:02:51.900> when<00:02:52.109> playing

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
across almost immediately when playing

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.349 
across almost immediately when playing
the<00:02:52.500> game<00:02:52.709> and<00:02:52.889> it's<00:02:53.159> basically<00:02:53.519> a<00:02:53.639> variation

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
the game and it's basically a variation

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.119 
the game and it's basically a variation
of<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.810> board<00:02:55.109> game<00:02:55.319> mastermind<00:02:55.859> you're

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
of the board game mastermind you're

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:57.709 
of the board game mastermind you're

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:57.719 
given a certain amount of time to match

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:00.080 
given a certain amount of time to match
a<00:02:57.959> variety<00:02:58.409> of<00:02:58.439> tiles<00:02:58.889> into<00:02:59.310> their<00:02:59.519> designated

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
the end of each attempt you are told

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.089 
the end of each attempt you are told
both<00:03:03.629> how<00:03:03.989> many<00:03:04.169> times<00:03:04.409> you've<00:03:04.590> got<00:03:04.739> correct

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
both how many times you've got correct

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.470 
both how many times you've got correct
and<00:03:05.310> how<00:03:05.639> many<00:03:05.849> of<00:03:05.939> them<00:03:06.060> are<00:03:06.150> in<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.269> correct

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
and how many of them are in the correct

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.390 
and how many of them are in the correct
position<00:03:06.719> it's<00:03:07.260> basically<00:03:07.680> a<00:03:07.829> mix<00:03:08.159> of

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
position it's basically a mix of

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.670 
position it's basically a mix of
guesswork<00:03:08.879> and<00:03:09.180> logical<00:03:09.840> thinking<00:03:10.199> and<00:03:10.260> both

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
guesswork and logical thinking and both

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.770 
guesswork and logical thinking and both
isn't<00:03:11.129> particularly<00:03:11.459> fun<00:03:11.849> and<00:03:12.060> brings<00:03:12.629> down

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
isn't particularly fun and brings down

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.750 
isn't particularly fun and brings down
the<00:03:12.840> tempo<00:03:13.290> of<00:03:13.379> the<00:03:13.469> game<00:03:13.500> substantially<00:03:14.310> also

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
the tempo of the game substantially also

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.699 
the tempo of the game substantially also
due<00:03:15.030> to<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.299> limitations<00:03:16.049> of<00:03:16.139> the<00:03:16.260> size<00:03:16.500> of

due to the limitations of the size of
the<00:03:16.829> screen<00:03:16.919> you<00:03:17.370> can<00:03:17.489> only<00:03:17.699> see<00:03:17.939> your<00:03:18.150> last

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
the screen you can only see your last

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:19.909 
the screen you can only see your last
three<00:03:18.569> attempts<00:03:19.079> and<00:03:19.229> later<00:03:19.530> on<00:03:19.680> in<00:03:19.799> the<00:03:19.889> game

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:19.919 
three attempts and later on in the game

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:22.069 
three attempts and later on in the game
where<00:03:20.280> you've<00:03:20.400> got<00:03:20.519> more<00:03:20.819> tiles<00:03:21.120> to<00:03:21.509> work<00:03:21.900> out

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
where you've got more tiles to work out

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:23.960 
where you've got more tiles to work out
the<00:03:22.259> order<00:03:22.530> of<00:03:22.650> it<00:03:22.829> really<00:03:23.129> does<00:03:23.400> become<00:03:23.609> a

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
the order of it really does become a

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.089 
the order of it really does become a
pain<00:03:24.299> to<00:03:24.540> remember<00:03:25.019> which<00:03:25.470> combinations

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
pain to remember which combinations

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:27.920 
pain to remember which combinations
you've<00:03:26.340> submitted<00:03:26.549> previously<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.599> second

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930

you've submitted previously the second
type<00:03:28.079> of<00:03:28.259> puzzle<00:03:28.500> game<00:03:28.829> is<00:03:29.159> a<00:03:29.280> variation<00:03:30.269> on

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
type of puzzle game is a variation on

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.119 
type of puzzle game is a variation on
the<00:03:30.569> popular<00:03:31.049> classic<00:03:31.439> pipe<00:03:31.739> dream<00:03:31.979> and

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
the popular classic pipe dream and

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.189 
the popular classic pipe dream and
basically<00:03:32.549> involves<00:03:33.239> you<00:03:33.359> matching<00:03:33.750> up<00:03:33.900> pipes

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:34.199 
basically involves you matching up pipes

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:36.259 
basically involves you matching up pipes
from<00:03:34.470> point<00:03:34.799> A<00:03:34.919> to<00:03:34.949> point<00:03:35.250> B<00:03:35.489> within<00:03:36.000> a<00:03:36.090> certain

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
from point A to point B within a certain

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.420 
from point A to point B within a certain
time<00:03:36.540> limit<00:03:36.569> and<00:03:36.989> after<00:03:37.259> a<00:03:37.290> while<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:37.799> energy

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
time limit and after a while the energy

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.740 
time limit and after a while the energy
will<00:03:38.519> start<00:03:38.819> flowing<00:03:39.120> through<00:03:39.359> these<00:03:39.509> pipes

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
will start flowing through these pipes

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.330 
will start flowing through these pipes
really<00:03:40.349> putting<00:03:40.620> the<00:03:40.650> pressure<00:03:40.769> on<00:03:41.069> you<00:03:41.310> to

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
really putting the pressure on you to

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.280 
really putting the pressure on you to
get<00:03:41.879> the<00:03:42.000> rest<00:03:42.120> of<00:03:42.299> them<00:03:42.389> laid<00:03:42.599> so<00:03:43.079> that<00:03:43.199> it

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
get the rest of them laid so that it

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.449 
get the rest of them laid so that it
doesn't<00:03:43.470> get<00:03:43.709> to<00:03:43.829> the<00:03:43.859> end<00:03:44.069> of<00:03:44.189> the<00:03:44.280> pipe

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
doesn't get to the end of the pipe

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.219 
doesn't get to the end of the pipe
before<00:03:44.699> you<00:03:44.939> get<00:03:45.090> to<00:03:45.180> point<00:03:45.389> B<00:03:45.540> however<00:03:46.019> it's

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:46.229 
before you get to point B however it's

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:48.050 
before you get to point B however it's
pretty<00:03:46.379> unforgiving<00:03:47.099> and<00:03:47.250> you<00:03:47.340> do<00:03:47.489> get<00:03:47.669> a<00:03:47.699> lot

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
pretty unforgiving and you do get a lot

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.789 
pretty unforgiving and you do get a lot
of<00:03:48.090> junk<00:03:48.449> pipes<00:03:48.750> that<00:03:49.079> you'll<00:03:49.169> just<00:03:49.379> need<00:03:49.620> to

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
of junk pipes that you'll just need to

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.710 
of junk pipes that you'll just need to
end<00:03:50.009> up<00:03:50.129> going<00:03:50.459> to<00:03:50.609> one<00:03:50.729> side<00:03:51.090> and<00:03:51.329> you<00:03:51.509> can't

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
end up going to one side and you can't

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.059 
end up going to one side and you can't
navigate<00:03:51.900> your<00:03:52.290> way<00:03:52.349> across<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:52.709> maps

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
navigate your way across the maps

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:54.979 
navigate your way across the maps
particularly<00:03:53.699> quickly<00:03:54.030> meaning<00:03:54.540> it's<00:03:54.689> a<00:03:54.840> lot

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
particularly quickly meaning it's a lot

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.479 
particularly quickly meaning it's a lot
safer<00:03:55.229> to<00:03:55.530> kind<00:03:55.769> of<00:03:55.829> stick<00:03:56.040> in<00:03:56.189> your<00:03:56.219> immediate

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
safer to kind of stick in your immediate

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.399 
safer to kind of stick in your immediate
area<00:03:57.000> and<00:03:57.120> just<00:03:57.299> dump<00:03:57.569> all<00:03:57.780> the<00:03:57.900> chaff<00:03:58.109> off<00:03:58.259> to

00:03:58.399 --> 00:03:58.409 
area and just dump all the chaff off to

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:00.170 
area and just dump all the chaff off to
one<00:03:58.560> side<00:03:58.590> until<00:03:59.069> you<00:03:59.280> get<00:03:59.430> a<00:03:59.459> bit<00:03:59.729> that<00:04:00.000> fits

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
one side until you get a bit that fits

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.640 
one side until you get a bit that fits
what<00:04:00.329> you<00:04:00.419> need<00:04:00.540> to<00:04:00.659> do<00:04:00.810> however<00:04:01.199> if<00:04:01.379> you<00:04:01.500> do

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
what you need to do however if you do

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.289 
what you need to do however if you do
run<00:04:01.829> out<00:04:01.919> of<00:04:01.949> space<00:04:02.099> you<00:04:02.430> can<00:04:02.639> place<00:04:03.090> two

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
run out of space you can place two

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:04.670 
run out of space you can place two
different<00:04:03.599> kinds<00:04:03.689> of<00:04:03.870> pipe<00:04:04.049> on<00:04:04.259> top<00:04:04.439> of<00:04:04.590> each

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
different kinds of pipe on top of each

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.229 
different kinds of pipe on top of each
other<00:04:04.829> however<00:04:05.370> this<00:04:05.459> will<00:04:05.669> destroy<00:04:06.000> the

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
other however this will destroy the

other however this will destroy the
eight<00:04:06.540> tiles<00:04:06.900> that<00:04:07.199> surround<00:04:07.560> this<00:04:07.709> tile<00:04:07.949> so

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
eight tiles that surround this tile so

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.219 
eight tiles that surround this tile so
is<00:04:08.430> only<00:04:08.549> to<00:04:08.759> be<00:04:08.790> used<00:04:08.909> in<00:04:09.359> circumstances

where you're not going to undo all of

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:13.789 
where you're not going to undo all of
your<00:04:11.819> hard<00:04:12.030> work<00:04:12.209> these<00:04:12.659> niggli<00:04:13.079> points<00:04:13.469> aside

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
your hard work these niggli points aside

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.800 
your hard work these niggli points aside
it<00:04:14.219> does<00:04:14.430> fit<00:04:14.639> the<00:04:14.759> style<00:04:14.939> of<00:04:15.120> the<00:04:15.329> overall

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
it does fit the style of the overall

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.749 
it does fit the style of the overall
gameplay<00:04:16.109> a<00:04:16.349> lot<00:04:16.590> better<00:04:16.829> and<00:04:17.130> adds<00:04:17.340> a<00:04:17.489> lot<00:04:17.609> of

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:17.759 
gameplay a lot better and adds a lot of

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:19.640 
gameplay a lot better and adds a lot of
tension<00:04:18.150> to<00:04:18.269> the<00:04:18.299> game<00:04:18.570> so<00:04:18.959> lastly<00:04:19.409> we<00:04:19.620> have

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
tension to the game so lastly we have

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.949 
tension to the game so lastly we have
the<00:04:19.829> top<00:04:20.400> down<00:04:20.430> action<00:04:21.000> segments<00:04:21.570> of<00:04:21.659> the<00:04:21.779> game
