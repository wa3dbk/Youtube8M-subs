this level for area 2 or whatever it's
gold<00:02:38.780> okay<00:02:39.890> basically<00:02:40.890> it's<00:02:41.040> going<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.250> have

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
gold okay basically it's going to have

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.420 
gold okay basically it's going to have
the<00:02:41.730> same<00:02:41.760> overall<00:02:42.480> layout<00:02:42.870> it<00:02:43.380> will<00:02:43.769> just<00:02:43.800> a

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
the same overall layout it will just a

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.820 
the same overall layout it will just a
different<00:02:45.120> color<00:02:45.269> really<00:02:45.590> so<00:02:46.590> instead<00:02:46.769> of

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
different color really so instead of

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.740 
different color really so instead of
green<00:02:47.099> it's<00:02:47.370> purple<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:48.030> it<00:02:48.540> will<00:02:48.660> be

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
green it's purple and it will be

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.380 
green it's purple and it will be
slightly<00:02:48.900> more<00:02:49.200> difficult<00:02:49.230> like<00:02:49.830> instead<00:02:49.980> of

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
slightly more difficult like instead of

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.520 
slightly more difficult like instead of
