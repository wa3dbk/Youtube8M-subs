00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:05.339
 welcome to cpp series cooling courses 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.260
 he drove we want to make clear a very important detail 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:12.689
 when we talk about refrigeration 

00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:15.940
 we are not just talking about refrigerators and freezers 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.440
 or the air conditioners that are installed in the Joseph's room of the four 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:21.669
 homes 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:22.780
 in nine games 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.699
 all systems that operate 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:27.910
 lowering the temperature of environments resulting in 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.060
 these benefits can be 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.030
 comfort and well-being for people 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.030
 increased productivity and better quality of services 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.600
 the industrial production and preserves are of perishable food 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.160
 so when taking the courses of our series you will have the opportunity not 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.000
 only to know in detail the various refrigeration systems 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.610
 but mainly to understand how it works 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.460
 how they should be installed and operated beyond the maintenance required to 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.950
 that they are kept in perfect working condition 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.570
 maintenance is a point that deserves very special attention 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.560
 because many who work with refrigeration may not perform their 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.460
 work properly because they lack the necessary technical information 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.520
 So 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.750
 professionals like you who already work or who want to work in this field are 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.539
 acting right to seek better technical and professional qualification 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.230
 this goal we cpt and hope you achieve to make the 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.050
 our refrigeration series courses 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.990
 become the professional technically qualified mind 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.690
 to carry out their work ethically and professionally
