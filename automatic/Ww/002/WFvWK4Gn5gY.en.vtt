00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.960
 program 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.059
 report in champéry where the champion of 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.840
 world title refines his style to 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.220
 sides of the master 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.380
 Roman rose ang elizaveta tuktamisheva 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.279
 two months ago 18-year-old Russian 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.020
 take down the grail 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.359
 she wins the gold medal at 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.220
 in Shanghai a few weeks 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.010
 later she attaches the services of 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.330
 stéphane lambiel 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:34.710
 it is at the paladium of champéry that the 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.420
 two skaters have an appointment they have 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.739
 a week to prepare for the next 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.739
 choreography of the young Russian 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.930
 when I was little I was watching 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:51.000
 stéphane on television I told myself 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.020
 wow what a beautiful skater today 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.780
 she is my choreographer 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.399
 he knows when I'm tired he knows this 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.440
 that I feel nothing but seeing my face 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.129
 it's really nice to work 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.840
 with him 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.920
 it was an honor for me 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.769
 work with her I like a lot 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.510
 this girl I really like her skating 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:09.930
 I think technically it's the 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.210
 skater the strongest we've seen these 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.469
 last ten years with a magnificent 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.759
 triple axel 

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:18.200
 artistically on the other hand the champion 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:18.799
 of the world has a large margin of 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.450
 progression 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:24.049
 that's what she's working on 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:30.950
 stéphane lambiel no no and this weekend 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:32.960
 there we work and I can not give my 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.970
 opinion but it is he who decides everything 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.649
 sometimes he makes figures a priori 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.210
 very easy but who are extremely 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:41.060
 hard to reproduce 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.619
 he is a true professional of others 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.130
 skaters also appealed to 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.319
 Valais 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.929
 among them denniston Olympic medals 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:48.500
 and carolina kostner world champion 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:51.649
 2012 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.640
 he asks the perfume lambiel so it's 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.009
 a little bit that I'm trying to do 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.979
 I try to give them that smell 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.959
 it's this fragrance and then who 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.090
 go back there with my mind 

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:03.530
 but a little bit a touch that must 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.439
 allow the Russian to land a 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.590
 second world title in 2016 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.590
 I see
