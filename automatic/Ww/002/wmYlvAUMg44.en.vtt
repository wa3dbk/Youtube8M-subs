00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:32.140

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:35.080
 young people good that when in the time of 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.299
 God is the one that you marry you marry 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.680
 in God's time that is the question 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.569
 million dollars 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.269
 people say why you're so young 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:45.220

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:48.549
 god when the time of god comes the 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:52.209
 things go in their order and like juanín 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:54.640
 golding 12 god is present and my 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.260
 advice would be wait your time young not 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.090
 you despair 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.950
 because I know the secret that we 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.120
 nowadays in a house that we wait for the 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.379
 God's time we knew wait there 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.939
 ask the Lord for discernment 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:09.670
 spiritual that opens our ears 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:12.579
 spiritual because God speaks to you I 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.849
 I told the Lord I want you to tell me 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:18.609
 who is my husband and the Lord revealed to me 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:20.620
 once I saw this young man he is your 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.630
 husband and also that he has confirmed in 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.760
 several occasions titles of real god 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.650
 speak simply and simply you have to 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.900
 wait all the time of God many 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.910
 Sometimes the individual wants to put 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.680
 haste in you feels that you already 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.810
 You are staying single but is lie 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.750
 Devil because what God says good 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.360
 do not despair to me only we 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.099
 it remains to say if you have no more questions 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.919
 See you later, if you do not bless me 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:46.419
 anyone who does not see this video just 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:51.050
