00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.070
 first broadcast caused a lot of controversy a novel 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.050
 too level monotonous plot 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.760
 primitive scares and natural however 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.269
 I can say that I liked the game 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:17.880
 so dry what is it more kills the doctor 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.810
 not 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.880
 strange I think I'm glad my account 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.079
 better quality 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:24.519
 I graduated from the calculation of quotas I liked the game 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:26.949
 first stichera yes indeed level 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:28.559
 looked monotonous when 

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:31.059
 scared to please all currencies right 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:33.010
 let's say we didn't want to play 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.810
 it was fun 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.310
 mainly thanks to the shootout right already 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.640
 hurt and smart ass there were enemies here 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.990
 they say just any communication authorities could 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.660
 even put will settle down here came out 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.780
 the second part is on your screens 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.910
 I think that we actually see 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.860
 as for the level, they were like and mail 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.150
 or office or some sort of laboratories so 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.640
 and left that is generally for two years 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.460
 nothing has changed by and large 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.640
 well this is when driven by the plot 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.970
 the fact is that in particular the situation 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.960
 such that we are in hospital now 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.280
 why did this happen according to the main plot 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.090
 the hero was trying to save up on Zaporozhets 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.690
 Ugra Moscow drove 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.290
 in the end absolutely gone crazy run without 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.490
 pants on the streets jinxed grandmothers with 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.329
 wild cries down with a lift 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:18.189
 and now he has to choose between home 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:18.770
 to 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.159
 reach the game Moscow drove to the end and we 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:23.780
 should help him in this good purpose and here 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.000
 killing three points 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.170
 orderlies it punches making its way forward from 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.640
 so fret weiss way actually coughing 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.700
 what weapon does he have in his hands he is fighting 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.740
 hospital ducks 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.880
 percentage in which own market 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.590
 need to do all sorts of things 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.570
 and now I have come to a dead end than before 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.549
 the doors open especially as an employee 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.730
 creeping be done see 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.950
 yes, by the way, I always have something in the kitchen 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.820
 such a position creeps the night I even 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.170
 bought some kind of cure for cockroaches 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.090
 but still not to eradicate 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.990
 of this 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.530
 well what are these guys are you still 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.829
 say that the first part is bad scary 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:01.659
 one that decks can scare on 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.290
 in fact in my opinion nobody myself 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.380
 at least once frightened in the course of this video 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.060
 also then i gotta moms who watches 50 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.660
 bucks so remember that is 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.399
 for God's sake 

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:13.729
 so you can rely on me i don't 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:15.419
 let you down and as you see as in the first 

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:17.169
 parts distance between enemies 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:19.370
 filled with evening and corridors 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.659
 in which we must pass ooh god 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:22.150
 my 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.540
 Iâ€™m 12 already to win how am I 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.690
 scared yes no indeed of course 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.969
 not scared 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:29.009
 he is still alive 

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:30.279
 die ben affleck 

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:32.049
 I really do not worry 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.479
 so the situation should not be there now 

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:36.079
 We look what in what turned into 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:36.850
 shootout 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.179
 if in the first part 0 

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:40.419
 marriage percentage versus four special forces 

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:42.609
 it was real beaten it was possible by six 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:44.429
 once reboot so i can just 

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:46.519
 for two at an average level will develop but 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:47.130
 does not matter 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.590
 I can just write it down and shoot a block dasha 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.500
 not that it hits me it doesn't matter 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.389
 because 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:54.110
 in the world here is also very difficult 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.620
 just ran 4 corners he flunked one 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.539
 naked 

00:02:57.539 --> 00:03:00.029
 2 and this despite the fact that the left hand and scratching 

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:02.279
 I have the right to go right after that they give me 

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:04.229
 full of life now must still 

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:06.579
 about cases this is a super fight to go through 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.339
 but the continuation of the banquet 

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:10.529
 and what we see 

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:12.919
 what are some strange dungeon barriers from 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:14.759
 which bashko will be dedicated 

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:16.649
 surplus kris verstig 

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:18.119
 in his first clip 

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:20.359
 Kashchenko makes sense to talk about what 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:22.959
 it played better than the first part but then 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.049
 the graphics got better 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.909
 anna give psl say you are paris hilton 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:30.249
 Silicone boobs better than ordinary Peris 

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:31.119
 hilton 

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:33.250
 in general, look here especially nothing 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.930
 although strangely surrounding 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.429
 the setting is sad 

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:38.439
 the same as in the first part but nonetheless 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:41.069
 do not feel that this is a continuation 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.179
 as all try to beat them became 

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:45.729
 much wiser even wiser 

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:47.859
 appearance despite all die 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:49.779
 began to look a little different in 

00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:53.389
 scare the story like a hedgehog and bare ass I 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:54.879
 frankly plastic to me 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:56.929
 operations on rye and mickey rurka much 

00:03:56.929 --> 00:03:59.989
 it seems worse to look at them in a box 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.799
 and the enemies behave as if they would single out 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.439
 3 liters of strong beer and they are full of vegetable 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:06.099
 darkness 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:07.799
 I do not know what else to add here for example 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.699
 see what a wonderful home 

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:10.429
 to win 

00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:12.629
 through the door that closes this group 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:15.649
 Saransk, the bridge in the first row saw in 

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:16.260
 principle 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.769
 Persia who went on the rack then it was 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.930
 I constantly something shaday reduced 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.240
 maybe it's because with a strong lise 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.930
 beer seems to me to bam and we do not but here 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.419
 check sat down for the fact that the militants 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:28.520
 stop 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.759
 that's all 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:32.740
 power express 5 and below what's the difference 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.119
 caused by the fot situation in the first part 

00:04:35.119 --> 00:04:37.419
 shot so little will not seem right away 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.220
 hello russia did not notice 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.460
 where are you from 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.380
 I did not see it, I think there is already something to decide for 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.699
 the box did not see and so I did not see it 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:46.940
 nanoseconds 10 agree real 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.319
 life market is seriously serious playing this 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:50.310
 unforgivable 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.029
 that is, if I entered 

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:54.460
 but I should have immediately in the form 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.979
 while still could run up and 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.389
 stretched out and pull on your heads but 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:00.490
 no he sat there for these boxes quickly 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.570
 me four times 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:02.919
 I do not know what is there 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:05.509
 lawsuits on honey and some kind of radio and I have there 

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:08.129
 during life and all where to give that nothing 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:10.050
 I see that it is closed 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.530
 as always st it is difficult to determine where to go 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.189
 go 

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:16.019
 such games varied mass 

00:05:16.019 --> 00:05:17.809
 monotonous in front of real estate investors frequent 

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:19.319
 arkhangelsk sphere especially when 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.599
 Record a video of music found Kokoity 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:24.269
 the switch is worth it but probably on it 

00:05:24.269 --> 00:05:26.529
 we finish the review with colombia after that 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:28.169
 i exhibited myself starting stays 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:30.499
 just add that reviews 

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:33.249
 others can be found on the Madison Point website 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:35.319
 hands dot ru in the same place you can look 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:37.129
 such as domestic 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:38.659
 developers are doing 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:40.949
 died almost twice today was 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:43.949
 such a topic is once again particularly dangerous 

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:46.589
 why should I confess my mother to me 

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:48.739
 supply left insult how to kill 

00:05:48.739 --> 00:05:50.879
 its so how is it 

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:53.819
 may not even know my mother well well 

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:57.289
 there were only 3 from me 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:05:58.289
 out of five 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:00.599
 I even despite huge bukher and on 

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:02.529
 the background is not an extra 2 

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:04.839
 points so three out of five sorry 

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:06.379
 that's all for today
