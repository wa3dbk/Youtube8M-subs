00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.470
 O 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.470
 Our team is simple, the scene is repeated 

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:12.579
 the consequence of 

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:15.619
 public to grow 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:16.900
 Do you know what i want 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.369
 instead of falling in the middle 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:20.800
 and so on xiaobo 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.269
 diego dinho 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:26.640
 the deficit went well too 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.560
 bp now 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.279
 right 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.760
 so lets reconcile 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.540
 the resonance 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.370
 I think you 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.900
 but here 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.420
 give that fact 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.750
 Do you twitter me? 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.330
 award 7 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.080
 murray 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.600
 after resigning 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.600
 sure the site statistics c 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.230
 on the website of the country that I have with 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.319
 what you write 

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:01.300
 to persist 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.650
 7 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.860
 6 I think that you leave right 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.450
 it does not bring every shock 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.630
 3 regan well that something 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.400
 So 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.620
 I bike 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.950
 my tce typical physically right 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.280
 can only 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.280
 this treatment 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.270
 I think it will be this way when you see the right empress secretary 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.400
 so here we are going to do 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.400

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.960

 always the little rock this month 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.030
 and change the right mix so we'll be putting what was in the mix 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.840
 cel phone entry tokyo 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.600

 this year were remarks that started as a headline 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.429
 a pickup truck 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.279

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:17.559
 so the pdt was already 

00:04:17.559 --> 00:04:20.559
 Let's make 

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:31.349
 even though 70 dead 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:32.690

 in 15 matches 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:04:58.730

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.509
 d 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:04.599
 but if your countries put it there 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:07.599
 it is a mistake to place here 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.800
 if you want crowley 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.139

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:17.139
 we make sense

 Dissidents of the Cuban regime put a name that has 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.559
 I do not have how it had to be the title of the saints 

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:47.370
 at the time saved 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.089

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:52.089

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.520
