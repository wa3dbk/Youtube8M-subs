00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:12.940
 today we are going to make sea bass to the hole for 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:15.570
 we have here a sea bass that they give us 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.570
 open 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.240
 two 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.000
 we have open 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:33.769
 we also need parsley garlic potatoes 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.540
 chili pepper cayenne oil salt and vinegar 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:37.610
 Apple 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.550
 We peeled and washed potatoes and 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:44.930
 we have sliced a very reluctant 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:48.350
 about half a centimeter a little more and 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:51.559
 the onion in large segments now let's go 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.079
 to add this they make us with oil and what 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.510
 We are going to fry but you do not have to 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:00.960
 is fried everything is everything since then 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:04.170
 will go to the oven but almost 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.799
 we have sprinkled with salt the potatoes and 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.229
 the onions and as they are golden 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.840
 on both sides good and half golden 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.570
 We will only remove them from the sources 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.850
 where we go then to bake 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.290
 as the potatoes are cooled and the 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.390
 onion 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.030
 we are withdrawing it to the source where 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.450
 let's bake fish then 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.940
 we have fried potatoes and onion 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:33.470
 Now let's put the sea bass on top 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:37.500
 open and we're going to sprinkle salt and 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:40.710
 we will put the skin down 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.040
 Once the sea bass is placed on top of the 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.670
 potatoes and sprinkled with salt we have 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.100
 added a thread of oil that 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.740
 we had used to fry the potatoes and 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.970
 the onions now we preheat the 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.940
 210 degree oven and when it is already 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.280
 hot we will introduce the source 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:06.360
 in the second height starting to count 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.989
 down heat up and down and what 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:13.110
 we will have about 10 or 15 minutes left 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.270
 one minute to finish the sea bass 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.530
 meanwhile we put a little oil in 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:22.890
 a frying pan and abundant rolled garlic 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:25.280
 as well as a street the one chilli 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.880
 little one of these 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:32.060
 when this one has been these garlic 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.890
 we will add apple cider vinegar with 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.320
 be careful because it will skip a lot 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.780
 put a tupper and then 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.170
 we will pour this content on the 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.300
 Bass 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.010
 we already have the garlic golden so 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.459
 now let's throw vinegar this is at 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.459
 taste 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.250
 and now 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.790
 we say it above but no more 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.920
 finally sprinkle a little 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.160
 chopped parsley above and eat 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.160
 immediately
