here but that's the same door handle as

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.100 
here but that's the same door handle as
you'd<00:01:12.190> find<00:01:12.430> on<00:01:12.520> the<00:01:12.640> front<00:01:12.880> doors<00:01:13.090> so<00:01:13.960> it

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
you'd find on the front doors so it

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.530 
you'd find on the front doors so it
should<00:01:14.260> be<00:01:14.290> pretty<00:01:14.380> easy<00:01:14.620> to<00:01:14.860> find<00:01:15.540> dual

been<00:01:22.960> dubbed<00:01:23.260> out<00:01:23.440> so<00:01:24.040> you<00:01:24.100> can<00:01:24.250> put<00:01:24.430> some

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
been dubbed out so you can put some

been dubbed out so you can put some
pretty<00:01:24.850> fat<00:01:25.060> tires<00:01:25.360> in<00:01:25.570> the<00:01:25.600> back<00:01:26.280> let's<00:01:27.280> take

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
pretty fat tires in the back let's take

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:37.530

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
headers back into dual exhaust this is

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.070 
headers back into dual exhaust this is
though<00:01:55.990> it's<00:01:56.170> a<00:01:56.229> 69<00:01:56.800> we<00:01:57.550> put<00:01:57.759> a<00:01:57.789> 1985<00:01:58.630> front

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
though it's a 69 we put a 1985 front

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.930 
though it's a 69 we put a 1985 front
clip<00:01:59.320> in<00:01:59.530> the<00:01:59.770> front<00:02:00.039> end<00:02:00.220> I<00:02:00.430> only<00:02:00.729> had<00:02:00.910> to

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
clip in the front end I only had to

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.330 
clip in the front end I only had to
drill<00:02:01.210> to<00:02:01.390> an<00:02:01.450> extra<00:02:01.869> holes<00:02:02.080> but<00:02:02.800> that<00:02:02.950> gave<00:02:03.160> us

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
drill to an extra holes but that gave us

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.969 
drill to an extra holes but that gave us
the<00:02:03.460> ability<00:02:03.550> to<00:02:03.910> put<00:02:04.119> power<00:02:04.780> disc<00:02:05.470> brakes<00:02:05.830> in

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
the ability to put power disc brakes in

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.449 
the ability to put power disc brakes in
the<00:02:06.009> front<00:02:06.240> typically<00:02:07.240> these<00:02:07.420> vehicles<00:02:07.780> had

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
the front typically these vehicles had

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.400 
the front typically these vehicles had
manual<00:02:09.459> drum<00:02:09.789> brakes<00:02:10.060> it<00:02:10.690> also<00:02:10.869> gave<00:02:11.140> us<00:02:11.290> the

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
manual drum brakes it also gave us the

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.580 
manual drum brakes it also gave us the
ability<00:02:11.500> to<00:02:11.830> put<00:02:11.980> power<00:02:12.190> steering<00:02:12.370> on<00:02:13.000> this

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
ability to put power steering on this

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.710 
ability to put power steering on this
vehicle<00:02:14.590> so<00:02:14.980> this<00:02:15.160> this<00:02:15.700> vehicle<00:02:16.120> has<00:02:16.240> power

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
vehicle so this this vehicle has power

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.370 
vehicle so this this vehicle has power
brakes<00:02:17.080> power<00:02:17.260> steering<00:02:17.560> discs<00:02:18.400> in<00:02:18.550> the<00:02:18.610> front

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
brakes power steering discs in the front

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.080 
brakes power steering discs in the front
as<00:02:20.380> you<00:02:21.280> can<00:02:21.340> see<00:02:21.520> it<00:02:21.610> does<00:02:21.730> not<00:02:21.910> have

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
as you can see it does not have
