some<00:00:15.509> of<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.660> things<00:00:15.780> to<00:00:15.900> think<00:00:15.990> about<00:00:16.230> when

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
some of the things to think about when

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.439 
some of the things to think about when
first<00:00:17.190> of<00:00:17.279> all<00:00:17.340> selecting<00:00:17.820> your<00:00:17.910> trees<00:00:18.180> at<00:00:18.359> the

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
first of all selecting your trees at the

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.109 
first of all selecting your trees at the
nursery<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:20.250> size<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.640> tree<00:00:20.760> you<00:00:20.880> want<00:00:20.970> to

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
nursery is the size of tree you want to

nursery is the size of tree you want to
put<00:00:21.240> in<00:00:21.420> I<00:00:21.600> think<00:00:22.020> we<00:00:22.080> talked<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.380> little<00:00:22.470> bit

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
put in I think we talked a little bit

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.080 
put in I think we talked a little bit
about<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:23.070> in<00:00:23.250> some<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.519> pruning<00:00:23.730> videos

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
about that in some of the pruning videos

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.580 
about that in some of the pruning videos
making<00:00:24.420> sure<00:00:24.570> you<00:00:24.689> pick<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.900> tree<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.320> fits

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
making sure you pick a tree that fits

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.009 
making sure you pick a tree that fits
the<00:00:25.769> space<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.250> want<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.519> go<00:00:26.640> into<00:00:27.019> the

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
the space that you want to go into the

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.330 
the space that you want to go into the
other<00:00:28.109> thing<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.529> think<00:00:28.710> about<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.189> size

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
other thing to think about is the size

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.589 
other thing to think about is the size
of<00:00:29.519> tree<00:00:29.730> that<00:00:29.760> you're<00:00:29.970> actually<00:00:30.359> going<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.539> be

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
of tree that you're actually going to be

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.410 
of tree that you're actually going to be
planting<00:00:31.080> if<00:00:31.500> you've<00:00:31.679> decided<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.309> plant<00:00:33.300> the

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
planting if you've decided to plant the

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.630 
planting if you've decided to plant the
tree<00:00:33.570> yourself<00:00:34.040> and<00:00:35.040> you're<00:00:35.219> looking<00:00:35.489> at<00:00:35.579> a

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
tree yourself and you're looking at a

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.850 
tree yourself and you're looking at a
bald<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.000> burlap<00:00:36.300> tree<00:00:36.600> then<00:00:37.530> some<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.800> the

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
bald and burlap tree then some of the

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.410 
bald and burlap tree then some of the
considerations<00:00:38.309> are<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.730> size<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.270> ball

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
considerations are the size of the ball

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.040 
considerations are the size of the ball
itself<00:00:40.160> they<00:00:41.160> can<00:00:41.309> be<00:00:41.430> very<00:00:41.610> heavy<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.780> you

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
itself they can be very heavy and you

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.389 
itself they can be very heavy and you
want<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.320> make<00:00:43.440> sure<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.739> you're<00:00:43.950> prepared

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
want to make sure that you're prepared

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.549 
want to make sure that you're prepared
for<00:00:44.700> for<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.629> sort<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:45.870> experience<00:00:46.170> and

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
for for that sort of experience and

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.319 
for for that sort of experience and
being<00:00:47.100> able<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.340> handle<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.850> ball<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.180> move

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
being able to handle the ball and move

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.910 
being able to handle the ball and move
it<00:00:48.480> into<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:48.960> area<00:00:49.379> in<00:00:49.440> your<00:00:49.530> landscape

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
it into the the area in your landscape

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.610 
it into the the area in your landscape
that<00:00:50.039> you're<00:00:50.160> gonna<00:00:50.280> plant<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:51.440> one<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.500> the

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
that you're gonna plant it one of the

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.139 
that you're gonna plant it one of the
things<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.949> think<00:00:53.129> about<00:00:53.160> when<00:00:53.460> when<00:00:53.789> digging

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
things to think about when when digging

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.549 
things to think about when when digging
the<00:00:54.210> hole<00:00:54.360> for<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.719> tree<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.289> make<00:00:55.410> the

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
the hole for the tree is to make the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.590 
the hole for the tree is to make the
hole<00:00:55.770> quite<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.610> bit<00:00:56.760> larger<00:00:57.000> than<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.360> actual

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
hole quite a bit larger than the actual

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.080 
hole quite a bit larger than the actual
tree<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:58.109> you're<00:00:58.230> planting<00:00:58.910> use<00:00:59.910> your

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
tree that you're planting use your

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.060 
tree that you're planting use your
judgment<00:01:00.510> whatever<00:01:00.719> works<00:01:01.020> for<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.350> but<00:01:02.010> I

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
judgment whatever works for you but I

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.100 
judgment whatever works for you but I
like<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.520> think<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:02.820> maybe<00:01:03.090> twice<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.719> size<00:01:03.870> of

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
like to think of maybe twice the size of

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.359 
like to think of maybe twice the size of
the<00:01:04.170> ball<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.559> what<00:01:04.710> we're<00:01:04.830> looking<00:01:05.070> at<00:01:05.159> in

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
the ball is what we're looking at in

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.120 
the ball is what we're looking at in
width<00:01:05.610> not<00:01:06.150> in<00:01:06.330> depth<00:01:06.650> we<00:01:07.650> want<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.860> make<00:01:07.979> sure

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
width not in depth we want to make sure

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.630 
width not in depth we want to make sure
that<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.430> crown<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.180> tree<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:10.490> right<00:01:11.490> at

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
that the crown of the tree is right at

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.100 
that the crown of the tree is right at
soil<00:01:11.880> level<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.479> don't<00:01:12.659> want<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.840> get<00:01:12.990> the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
soil level so you don't want to get the

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.960 
soil level so you don't want to get the
tree<00:01:13.350> too<00:01:13.560> deep<00:01:13.770> in<00:01:14.010> fact<00:01:14.220> higher<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.790> better

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
tree too deep in fact higher is better

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.840 
tree too deep in fact higher is better
than<00:01:15.270> lower<00:01:16.130> the<00:01:17.130> other<00:01:17.250> things<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.670> think

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
than lower the other things to think

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.240 
than lower the other things to think
about<00:01:17.909> when<00:01:18.180> planting<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.720> tree<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.250> the

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
about when planting the tree is the

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.640 
about when planting the tree is the
basket<00:01:20.700> most<00:01:21.540> bald<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:21.990> burlap<00:01:22.259> trees<00:01:22.470> are

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
basket most bald and burlap trees are

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.640 
basket most bald and burlap trees are
gonna<00:01:22.770> have<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.009> basket<00:01:23.640> on<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:24.229> we<00:01:25.229> want<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.530> see

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
gonna have a basket on it we want to see

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.230 
gonna have a basket on it we want to see
that<00:01:25.770> basket<00:01:26.220> come<00:01:26.400> off<00:01:26.549> you're<00:01:26.909> gonna<00:01:27.030> need

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
that basket come off you're gonna need

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.730 
that basket come off you're gonna need
the<00:01:27.390> basket<00:01:27.810> on<00:01:27.930> there<00:01:28.140> as<00:01:28.290> you're<00:01:28.439> bringing

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
the basket on there as you're bringing

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.649 
the basket on there as you're bringing
it<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.070> hole<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.729> as<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.210> get<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.570> the

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
it to the hole and as you get it to the

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.990 
it to the hole and as you get it to the
hole<00:01:30.950> well<00:01:31.950> some<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.310> suggestions<00:01:32.640> are<00:01:32.820> to

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
hole well some of the suggestions are to

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.760 
hole well some of the suggestions are to
maybe<00:01:33.390> take<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.750> bottom<00:01:34.049> of<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.259> basket<00:01:34.409> off

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
maybe take the bottom of the basket off

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.289 
maybe take the bottom of the basket off

you want it and then snip away the rest
of<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.159> basket<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.610> it'll<00:01:44.670> come<00:01:44.909> off<00:01:45.030> pretty

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
of the basket and it'll come off pretty

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.350 
of the basket and it'll come off pretty
easily<00:01:45.920> then<00:01:46.920> after<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.490> then<00:01:47.939> we<00:01:47.970> look<00:01:48.210> at

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
easily then after that then we look at

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.200 
easily then after that then we look at
trying<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.720> remove<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.110> burlap<00:01:49.939> take<00:01:50.939> as<00:01:51.060> much

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
trying to remove the burlap take as much

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.910 
trying to remove the burlap take as much
off<00:01:51.390> as<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:51.689> can<00:01:51.899> without<00:01:52.259> letting<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.740> ball

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
off as you can without letting the ball

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.889 
off as you can without letting the ball
fall<00:01:53.159> apart<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:54.240> that's<00:01:54.420> one<00:01:54.600> thing<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.869> think

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
fall apart and that's one thing to think

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.539 
fall apart and that's one thing to think
about<00:01:55.110> when<00:01:55.350> transporting<00:01:55.979> into<00:01:56.130> tree<00:01:56.280> moving

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
about when transporting into tree moving

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.459 
about when transporting into tree moving
into<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.969> hole<00:01:57.149> is<00:01:57.659> making<00:01:58.049> sure<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.229> you

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
into the hole is making sure that you

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.100 
into the hole is making sure that you
keep<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.920> ball<00:01:59.100> together<00:01:59.399> as<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.479> as<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.990> do

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
keep the ball together as you as you do

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.660 
keep the ball together as you as you do
this<00:02:01.229> so<00:02:01.439> don't<00:02:01.560> drop<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:02.130> don't<00:02:02.369> roll<00:02:02.640> it

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
this so don't drop it don't roll it

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.190 
this so don't drop it don't roll it
around<00:02:02.850> too<00:02:03.240> much<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.630> sort<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:03.899> thing<00:02:04.079> and

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
around too much that sort of thing and

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.420 
around too much that sort of thing and
that's<00:02:04.259> why<00:02:04.530> another<00:02:04.740> important

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
that's why another important

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.830 
that's why another important
consideration<00:02:06.000> in<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.240> size<00:02:06.479> of<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.689> ball

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
consideration in the size of the ball

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.559 
consideration in the size of the ball
and<00:02:06.990> what<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.200> can<00:02:07.350> handle<00:02:07.910> after<00:02:08.910> we<00:02:09.270> get<00:02:09.390> the

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
and what you can handle after we get the

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.260 
and what you can handle after we get the
ball<00:02:09.720> in<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.020> hole<00:02:10.170> in<00:02:10.649> the

ball in the hole in the
it's<00:02:11.630> situated<00:02:12.140> the<00:02:12.230> way<00:02:12.260> we<00:02:12.440> want<00:02:12.620> then<00:02:12.830> we

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
it's situated the way we want then we

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.800 
it's situated the way we want then we
want<00:02:13.070> to<00:02:13.130> start<00:02:13.340> packing<00:02:13.580> it<00:02:13.940> with<00:02:14.210> our<00:02:14.360> hands

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
want to start packing it with our hands

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.270 
want to start packing it with our hands
we<00:02:15.050> don't<00:02:15.230> want<00:02:15.350> to<00:02:15.410> stop<00:02:15.620> it<00:02:15.650> in<00:02:15.950> use<00:02:16.160> your

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
we don't want to stop it in use your

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.120 
we don't want to stop it in use your
shovel<00:02:16.640> to<00:02:16.670> fill<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.570> air<00:02:17.690> spaces<00:02:18.050> and<00:02:18.500> water

well<00:02:19.400> as<00:02:19.670> you<00:02:19.820> go<00:02:20.000> through<00:02:20.330> that<00:02:20.360> soak<00:02:21.050> it

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
well as you go through that soak it

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.440 
well as you go through that soak it
really<00:02:21.410> well<00:02:21.590> and<00:02:22.060> you<00:02:23.060> should<00:02:23.090> have<00:02:23.390> your

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
really well and you should have your

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.450 
really well and you should have your
tree<00:02:23.840> planted<00:02:24.320> follow<00:02:24.560> up<00:02:24.740> with<00:02:24.980> frequent

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
waterings making sure you never let it

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.670 
waterings making sure you never let it
dry<00:02:27.710> out<00:02:27.740> over<00:02:28.550> the<00:02:28.640> summer<00:02:28.820> months<00:02:29.000> here

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.160 

well<00:02:33.680> when<00:02:34.340> planting<00:02:34.880> a<00:02:35.090> containerized<00:02:35.690> shrub

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
well when planting a containerized shrub

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.650 
well when planting a containerized shrub
a<00:02:36.440> couple<00:02:37.190> of<00:02:37.250> things<00:02:37.400> to<00:02:37.640> think<00:02:37.760> about<00:02:37.910> and

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
a couple of things to think about and

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.180 
a couple of things to think about and
really<00:02:38.990> this<00:02:39.110> applies<00:02:39.470> to<00:02:39.500> any<00:02:39.740> container

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
really this applies to any container

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.550 
really this applies to any container

raised plant the the bold and burlap

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.850 
raised plant the the bold and burlap
tree<00:02:42.860> a<00:02:42.890> lot<00:02:43.100> of<00:02:43.220> times<00:02:43.460> is<00:02:43.840> is<00:02:44.840> maybe<00:02:45.440> more

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
tree a lot of times is is maybe more

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.950 
tree a lot of times is is maybe more
than<00:02:46.100> people<00:02:46.370> want<00:02:46.610> to<00:02:46.700> tackle<00:02:47.090> so<00:02:47.690> you<00:02:47.750> might

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
than people want to tackle so you might

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.780 
than people want to tackle so you might
want<00:02:48.140> something<00:02:48.470> that's<00:02:48.620> containerized<00:02:49.250> some

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
want something that's containerized some

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.700 
want something that's containerized some
of<00:02:49.850> the<00:02:49.910> real<00:02:50.090> advantages<00:02:50.290> are<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.470> fact<00:02:51.680> that

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:51.710 
of the real advantages are the fact that

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:52.870 
of the real advantages are the fact that
you<00:02:51.860> get<00:02:51.950> a<00:02:52.010> hundred<00:02:52.250> percent<00:02:52.310> of<00:02:52.580> the<00:02:52.670> root

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
you get a hundred percent of the root

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.340 
you get a hundred percent of the root
system<00:02:53.240> with<00:02:53.360> the<00:02:53.480> plant<00:02:53.720> so<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.020> plant<00:02:54.230> will

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
system with the plant so the plant will

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.950 
system with the plant so the plant will
probably<00:02:54.710> add<00:02:54.800> that<00:02:54.830> better<00:02:55.160> to<00:02:55.370> it's<00:02:55.960> the

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
probably add that better to it's the

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.210 
probably add that better to it's the
place<00:02:57.170> that<00:02:57.290> you're<00:02:57.440> sticking<00:02:57.830> it<00:02:57.920> because

place that you're sticking it because
it's<00:02:58.370> it's<00:02:58.580> not<00:02:58.670> going<00:02:58.910> to<00:02:58.970> go<00:02:59.090> through<00:02:59.240> the

it's it's not going to go through the

shrubs<00:03:05.360> and<00:03:05.570> trees<00:03:05.630> ruin<00:03:06.020> is<00:03:06.140> lighter<00:03:06.380> so<00:03:06.500> it's

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
shrubs and trees ruin is lighter so it's

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.710

you're<00:03:08.840> worried<00:03:09.020> about<00:03:09.050> is<00:03:09.260> the<00:03:09.410> weight

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
you're worried about is the weight

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.710 
you're worried about is the weight
involved<00:03:10.670> with<00:03:10.790> moving<00:03:11.090> something<00:03:11.420> big<00:03:11.570> like

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
involved with moving something big like

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.450 
involved with moving something big like
that<00:03:13.330> so<00:03:14.330> we<00:03:14.930> have<00:03:15.140> our<00:03:15.260> hole<00:03:15.410> dug<00:03:15.650> what<00:03:16.340> we

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.460 
that so we have our hole dug what we

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.040 
that so we have our hole dug what we
want<00:03:16.640> to<00:03:16.730> do<00:03:16.850> is<00:03:17.030> kind<00:03:17.270> of<00:03:17.360> tease<00:03:17.600> some<00:03:17.960> of

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
want to do is kind of tease some of

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.420 
want to do is kind of tease some of
these<00:03:18.140> roots<00:03:18.470> kind<00:03:18.740> of<00:03:18.830> pull<00:03:19.010> them<00:03:19.070> loose<00:03:19.280> a

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
these roots kind of pull them loose a

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.610 
these roots kind of pull them loose a
little<00:03:19.550> bit<00:03:19.780> loosen<00:03:20.780> up<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:21.020> ball<00:03:21.200> a<00:03:21.230> little

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
little bit loosen up the ball a little

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.750 
little bit loosen up the ball a little
we<00:03:21.830> don't<00:03:21.980> want<00:03:22.100> to<00:03:22.160> get<00:03:22.250> too<00:03:22.400> carried<00:03:22.610> away

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760

with it but we want to we kind of want
to<00:03:25.250> work<00:03:25.550> this<00:03:25.820> a<00:03:25.850> little<00:03:26.170> sometimes<00:03:27.170> you'll

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
to work this a little sometimes you'll

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.530 
to work this a little sometimes you'll
see<00:03:27.470> girdling<00:03:28.130> or<00:03:28.460> circling<00:03:29.000> roots<00:03:29.270> around

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
see girdling or circling roots around

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.540 
see girdling or circling roots around
there<00:03:29.750> you<00:03:30.230> may<00:03:30.380> want<00:03:30.590> to<00:03:30.650> cut<00:03:30.830> those<00:03:30.980> off<00:03:31.250> if

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
there you may want to cut those off if

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.820 
there you may want to cut those off if
they're<00:03:31.760> just<00:03:31.940> gonna<00:03:32.060> be<00:03:32.240> too<00:03:32.450> much<00:03:32.600> but<00:03:33.500> this

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
they're just gonna be too much but this

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.620 
they're just gonna be too much but this
one<00:03:34.040> is<00:03:34.250> that<00:03:34.370> this<00:03:34.520> is<00:03:34.670> well<00:03:34.880> rooted<00:03:35.120> and<00:03:35.510> this

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
one is that this is well rooted and this

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.960 
one is that this is well rooted and this
is<00:03:35.750> what<00:03:35.870> you<00:03:35.990> want<00:03:36.400> you'll<00:03:37.400> see<00:03:37.580> here<00:03:37.760> we<00:03:37.880> have

is what you want you'll see here we have

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.540 
is what you want you'll see here we have
a<00:03:38.000> good<00:03:38.270> good<00:03:39.110> roots<00:03:39.500> all<00:03:39.800> the<00:03:40.010> way<00:03:40.160> through

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
a good good roots all the way through

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.340 
a good good roots all the way through
here<00:03:41.030> you're<00:03:41.570> gonna<00:03:41.690> want<00:03:41.780> to<00:03:41.960> look<00:03:42.110> for

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
here you're gonna want to look for

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.500 
here you're gonna want to look for
sometimes<00:03:43.070> white<00:03:43.400> roots<00:03:43.640> shiny<00:03:44.090> white<00:03:44.330> roots

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
sometimes white roots shiny white roots

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.310 
sometimes white roots shiny white roots
which<00:03:44.750> means<00:03:44.960> we<00:03:45.110> have<00:03:45.230> some<00:03:45.410> new<00:03:45.530> root<00:03:45.710> growth

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
which means we have some new root growth

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.390 
which means we have some new root growth
after<00:03:48.320> that<00:03:48.440> we<00:03:48.590> want<00:03:48.740> to<00:03:48.770> make<00:03:48.920> sure<00:03:48.950> our<00:03:49.190> hole

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
after that we want to make sure our hole

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.280 
after that we want to make sure our hole
is<00:03:49.670> right<00:03:50.240> depth<00:03:50.510> again<00:03:50.780> we<00:03:50.960> don't<00:03:51.110> want<00:03:51.230> to

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
is right depth again we don't want to

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.240 
is right depth again we don't want to
plant<00:03:51.500> too<00:03:51.710> deep

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
plant too deep

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.190 
plant too deep
some<00:03:53.210> of<00:03:53.270> the<00:03:53.330> other<00:03:53.480> things<00:03:53.690> to<00:03:53.840> think<00:03:53.960> about

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
some of the other things to think about

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.600 
some of the other things to think about
after<00:03:54.350> you<00:03:54.530> have<00:03:54.650> the<00:03:54.770> hole<00:03:54.920> dug<00:03:55.130> if<00:03:55.310> you<00:03:55.430> have

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
after you have the hole dug if you have

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.190 
after you have the hole dug if you have
newer<00:03:55.850> soil<00:03:56.270> if<00:03:56.450> it's<00:03:56.570> a<00:03:56.690> new<00:03:56.810> construction

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
newer soil if it's a new construction

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.950 
newer soil if it's a new construction
site<00:03:57.530> you<00:03:57.650> may<00:03:57.770> want<00:03:57.980> to<00:03:58.010> add<00:03:58.220> some<00:03:58.960> composted

soil all the way around and through it
and<00:04:10.580> that<00:04:10.790> will<00:04:10.910> help<00:04:11.180> with<00:04:11.630> the<00:04:11.900> adaptation

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
and that will help with the adaptation

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.940 
and that will help with the adaptation

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
the hole and that'll help that plant do

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.970 
the hole and that'll help that plant do
well<00:04:22.640> in<00:04:22.850> this<00:04:23.000> in<00:04:23.270> our<00:04:23.480> soils<00:04:24.350> urn<00:04:24.500> sometimes
