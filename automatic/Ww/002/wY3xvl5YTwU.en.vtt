know from inner cities they I want to

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.570 
know from inner cities they I want to
see<00:00:26.400> them<00:00:26.610> contribute<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.810> know<00:00:27.930> this

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
see them contribute to you know this

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.920 
see them contribute to you know this
phenomenon<00:00:29.580> that<00:00:29.849> connects<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.810> whole

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:30.930 
phenomenon that connects the whole

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.100 

I<00:00:37.290> think<00:00:38.130> he's<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.280> brilliant<00:00:38.670> role<00:00:39.060> for<00:00:39.900> any

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
I think he's a brilliant role for any

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.930 
I think he's a brilliant role for any
young<00:00:40.350> people<00:00:40.830> and<00:00:40.950> particularly<00:00:41.310> our<00:00:41.730> young

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
young people and particularly our young

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.580 
young people and particularly our young
people<00:00:42.360> it's<00:00:42.660> important<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.230> have<00:00:43.350> someone

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
people it's important to have someone

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.650 
people it's important to have someone
like<00:00:43.770> will.i.am<00:00:44.040> evolve<00:00:44.460> because<00:00:44.820> young

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
like will.i.am evolve because young

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.750 
like will.i.am evolve because young
people<00:00:45.690> look<00:00:46.230> up<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.410> him<00:00:46.650> as<00:00:46.830> an<00:00:47.100> artist<00:00:47.550> and

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
people look up to him as an artist and

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.400 
people look up to him as an artist and
as<00:00:47.880> an<00:00:47.970> entrepreneur<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.540> look<00:00:48.750> at<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.990> local<00:00:49.290> to

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
as an entrepreneur I look at a local to

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.930 
as an entrepreneur I look at a local to
well<00:00:49.530> as<00:00:49.620> an<00:00:49.710> entrepreneur<00:00:50.220> he<00:00:50.490> has<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.730> great

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
people and I think between the two of us

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.680 
people and I think between the two of us
we<00:00:55.860> can<00:00:56.070> really<00:00:56.760> change<00:00:57.000> lives

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
we can really change lives

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.910 
we can really change lives
we'll<00:00:57.870> play<00:00:58.020> football<00:00:58.320> basketball<00:00:58.620> baseball

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
we'll play football basketball baseball

that's great that's what I do

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.370 
that's great that's what I do
but<00:01:02.760> what<00:01:03.150> about<00:01:03.680> science<00:01:05.479> engineering<00:01:06.479> but

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
but what about science engineering but

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.170 
but what about science engineering but
coding<00:01:07.860> because<00:01:08.070> I've<00:01:08.310> noticed<00:01:08.729> all<00:01:08.880> the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
coding because I've noticed all the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.359 
coding because I've noticed all the
people<00:01:09.509> that<00:01:09.630> were<00:01:09.810> more<00:01:09.990> successful<00:01:10.650> than<00:01:10.860> my

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
people that were more successful than my

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.450 
people that were more successful than my
little<00:01:11.580> group<00:01:11.820> in<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:13.050> industry<00:01:13.560> we're<00:01:14.220> all

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
little group in the industry we're all

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
and so I realize that there's an issue

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.430 
and so I realize that there's an issue
that's<00:01:30.040> that's<00:01:30.970> happening<00:01:31.480> constantly<00:01:31.750> and

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
that's that's happening constantly and

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.580 
that's that's happening constantly and
that<00:01:32.500> is<00:01:32.920> no<00:01:33.580> education<00:01:34.300> for<00:01:34.930> young<00:01:35.110> kids<00:01:35.350> and

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
that is no education for young kids and

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.080 
that is no education for young kids and
no<00:01:35.680> opportunity<00:01:35.800> with<00:01:36.550> science<00:01:37.000> technology

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
no opportunity with science technology

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.390 
no opportunity with science technology
engineering<00:01:37.810> mathematics<00:01:38.260> so<00:01:39.130> how<00:01:39.340> about

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
engineering mathematics so how about

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.760 
engineering mathematics so how about
send<00:01:39.760> kids<00:01:39.910> to<00:01:40.030> college<00:01:40.350> with<00:01:41.350> the<00:01:41.470> skill<00:01:41.740> set

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
send kids to college with the skill set

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.390 
send kids to college with the skill set
to<00:01:42.190> create<00:01:42.340> jobs<00:01:43.710> with<00:01:44.710> a<00:01:44.740> little<00:01:45.130> bit<00:01:45.280> of

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
to create jobs with a little bit of

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.550 
to create jobs with a little bit of
support<00:01:45.610> but<00:01:46.270> most<00:01:46.570> importantly<00:01:47.260> with<00:01:47.530> the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
right vision we know that young people

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.859 
right vision we know that young people
in<00:01:50.530> this<00:01:50.710> country<00:01:51.190> can<00:01:51.220> absolutely<00:01:51.970> fly<00:01:52.330> we

in this country can absolutely fly we

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:54.510 
in this country can absolutely fly we
