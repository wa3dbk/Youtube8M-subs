correctly is the question so I'm going

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.519 
correctly is the question so I'm going
to<00:00:20.369> explain<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.699> couple<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:21.090> tips<00:00:21.270> here<00:00:21.660> on<00:00:21.810> how

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
to explain a couple of tips here on how

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.019 
to explain a couple of tips here on how
to<00:00:22.590> really<00:00:22.859> do<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.160> foot<00:00:23.400> placements<00:00:23.910> and

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
to really do the foot placements and

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.640 
to really do the foot placements and
where<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.359> target<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.840> legs<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.380> weight<00:00:25.529> at

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
where to target the legs and weight at

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.490 
where to target the legs and weight at
target<00:00:26.010> obviously<00:00:26.490> more<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.150> quads<00:00:27.500> less

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
target obviously more of the quads less

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.169 
target obviously more of the quads less
of<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.740> hamstrings<00:00:29.340> I<00:00:29.490> think<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.910> lot<00:00:30.150> of

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
of the hamstrings I think a lot of

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.269 
of the hamstrings I think a lot of
people<00:00:30.480> have<00:00:30.660> that<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:31.470> misconception<00:00:32.189> they

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
people have that that misconception they

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.470 
people have that that misconception they
think<00:00:32.460> they<00:00:32.550> just<00:00:32.579> get<00:00:32.880> into<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.120> Machine<00:00:33.450> and

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
think they just get into the Machine and

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.420 
think they just get into the Machine and
it<00:00:33.690> does<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.989> work<00:00:34.020> but<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:35.010> really<00:00:35.250> have<00:00:35.370> to

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
it does the work but you really have to

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.799 
it does the work but you really have to
pay<00:00:35.640> attention<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:36.090> what<00:00:36.239> you're<00:00:36.360> doing<00:00:36.390> and

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
pay attention to what you're doing and

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.389 
pay attention to what you're doing and
really<00:00:36.930> try<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.170> put<00:00:37.380> focus<00:00:37.590> obviously<00:00:37.980> it's<00:00:38.340> a

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
really try to put focus obviously it's a

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.760

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
platform okay yes higher is going to

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.969 
platform okay yes higher is going to
make<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.689> lot<00:01:45.899> easier<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.290> press<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.560> lot<00:01:46.829> of

even some of the girls in the gym like
to<00:01:50.790> focus<00:01:51.119> on<00:01:51.270> pressing<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.720> lot<00:01:51.899> of<00:01:51.990> weights<00:01:52.170> to

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
to focus on pressing a lot of weights to

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.920 
to focus on pressing a lot of weights to
impress<00:01:52.649> people<00:01:53.299> we're<00:01:54.299> gonna<00:01:54.390> focus<00:01:54.659> on

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
impress people we're gonna focus on

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.569

really just trying to do the work get
the<00:01:56.700> most<00:01:56.880> contraction<00:01:57.450> out<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.689> legs

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
the most contraction out of the legs

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.880 
the most contraction out of the legs
okay<00:01:58.430> so<00:01:59.430> my<00:01:59.579> suggestion

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
okay so my suggestion

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.940 
okay so my suggestion
is<00:02:02.290> okay<00:02:03.430> the<00:02:04.430> feet<00:02:04.700> should<00:02:04.730> be<00:02:05.120> obviously

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
is okay the feet should be obviously

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.550 
is okay the feet should be obviously
platforms<00:02:06.950> vary<00:02:07.250> in<00:02:07.430> size<00:02:08.229> you<00:02:09.229> want<00:02:09.380> to<00:02:09.440> keep

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
platforms vary in size you want to keep

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.100 
platforms vary in size you want to keep
your<00:02:09.679> feet<00:02:09.979> on<00:02:10.970> a<00:02:11.060> lower<00:02:11.360> position<00:02:11.660> of<00:02:12.050> the

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
your feet on a lower position of the

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.900 
your feet on a lower position of the
platform<00:02:12.590> not<00:02:12.710> super<00:02:13.130> high<00:02:13.310> this<00:02:13.610> is<00:02:13.730> going<00:02:13.850> to

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
platform not super high this is going to

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.400 
platform not super high this is going to
work<00:02:14.060> more<00:02:14.270> the<00:02:14.420> hamstring<00:02:14.840> unless<00:02:15.170> that's

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
work more the hamstring unless that's

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
focus more on keeping the legs down in

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.320 
focus more on keeping the legs down in
the<00:02:19.730> lower<00:02:19.970> okay<00:02:20.510> and<00:02:21.020> not<00:02:22.010> much<00:02:22.910> more<00:02:23.150> than

shoulder-width apart I mean you see a

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.200 
shoulder-width apart I mean you see a
lot<00:02:24.740> of<00:02:24.860> people<00:02:25.010> spreading<00:02:25.460> their<00:02:25.790> legs<00:02:25.940> out

platform but you want to come down
enough<00:03:06.739> to<00:03:06.769> really<00:03:07.100> get<00:03:07.340> a<00:03:07.400> contraction<00:03:07.910> upper

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
enough to really get a contraction upper

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.620 
enough to really get a contraction upper
quads<00:03:08.780> and<00:03:09.049> up<00:03:09.440> okay<00:03:10.330> sometimes<00:03:11.330> people<00:03:11.510> like

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
quads and up okay sometimes people like

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.930 
quads and up okay sometimes people like
to<00:03:11.660> hold<00:03:11.900> on<00:03:12.049> to<00:03:12.230> the<00:03:12.320> sides<00:03:12.560> here<00:03:13.070> okay<00:03:13.760> the

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
to hold on to the sides here okay the

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.050 
to hold on to the sides here okay the
reps<00:03:14.150> should<00:03:14.299> be<00:03:14.450> steady<00:03:15.440> and<00:03:15.820> really<00:03:16.820> really

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
reps should be steady and really really

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.250 
reps should be steady and really really
just<00:03:17.180> trying<00:03:17.420> to<00:03:17.480> contract<00:03:17.900> the<00:03:18.019> quads

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
just trying to contract the quads

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.560 
just trying to contract the quads
control<00:03:18.739> the<00:03:18.920> downward<00:03:19.370> motion<00:03:19.570> obvious

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
control the downward motion obvious

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.600 
control the downward motion obvious
explode<00:03:21.080> up<00:03:21.430> okay

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
explode up okay

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.370 
explode up okay
not<00:03:23.060> to<00:03:23.269> the<00:03:23.360> point<00:03:23.540> where<00:03:23.660> you<00:03:23.810> actually<00:03:23.959> walk

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
not to the point where you actually walk

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.160 
not to the point where you actually walk
the<00:03:24.590> legs<00:03:24.799> out<00:03:25.040> but<00:03:25.910> really<00:03:26.120> keep<00:03:26.480> tension<00:03:26.870> on

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
the legs out but really keep tension on

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.990 
the legs out but really keep tension on
the<00:03:27.230> quads<00:03:27.560> that's<00:03:27.830> very<00:03:28.160> very<00:03:28.459> important

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
the quads that's very very important

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.539 
the quads that's very very important
it's<00:03:29.269> the<00:03:29.390> tension<00:03:29.660> a<00:03:29.989> lot<00:03:30.530> of<00:03:30.590> exercises<00:03:31.370> you

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
it's the tension a lot of exercises you

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.190 
it's the tension a lot of exercises you
don't<00:03:31.790> need<00:03:32.000> necessarily<00:03:32.450> need<00:03:32.570> to<00:03:32.690> lock<00:03:32.900> out

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
don't need necessarily need to lock out

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.259 
don't need necessarily need to lock out
but<00:03:33.769> keep<00:03:33.950> tension<00:03:34.220> on<00:03:34.430> the<00:03:34.519> quads<00:03:34.760> especially

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
but keep tension on the quads especially

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.949 
but keep tension on the quads especially
the<00:03:35.360> upper<00:03:35.510> quad<00:03:35.930> so<00:03:36.430> down<00:03:37.480> now<00:03:38.480> I<00:03:38.540> complete

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
the upper quad so down now I complete

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.870 
the upper quad so down now I complete
this<00:03:39.140> for<00:03:39.380> about<00:03:40.480> ten<00:03:41.480> or<00:03:41.600> twelve<00:03:41.630> repetitions

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
this for about ten or twelve repetitions

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.339 
this for about ten or twelve repetitions
always<00:03:43.880> my<00:03:44.030> suggestion

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
always my suggestion

always my suggestion
okay<00:03:46.920> smooth<00:03:47.249> and<00:03:47.430> steady<00:03:47.930> really<00:03:48.930> get<00:03:49.049> that

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
okay smooth and steady really get that

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.470 
okay smooth and steady really get that
contraction<00:03:49.829> as<00:03:50.040> you<00:03:50.730> see<00:03:50.879> I'm<00:03:50.969> not<00:03:50.999> going<00:03:51.239> to

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
contraction as you see I'm not going to

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.179 
contraction as you see I'm not going to
too<00:03:51.659> deep<00:03:51.870> but<00:03:52.079> just<00:03:52.260> enough<00:03:52.469> to<00:03:52.499> really

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:53.189 
too deep but just enough to really

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:57.140 
too deep but just enough to really
really<00:03:53.749> get<00:03:54.749> a<00:03:54.810> good<00:03:55.579> stretch<00:03:56.579> on<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:56.849> quad

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
really get a good stretch on the quad

and<00:03:57.420> up

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.220 

okay<00:04:08.950> so<00:04:09.950> foot<00:04:10.790> position<00:04:11.300> super<00:04:11.900> super

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
okay so foot position super super

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.640 
okay so foot position super super
important<00:04:12.880> really<00:04:13.880> keep<00:04:14.060> your<00:04:14.180> feet<00:04:14.450> low<00:04:15.440> on

important really keep your feet low on

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.140 
important really keep your feet low on
the<00:04:15.770> platform<00:04:16.220> it's<00:04:16.340> going<00:04:16.459> to<00:04:16.519> hit<00:04:16.640> more<00:04:16.910> of

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
the platform it's going to hit more of

the platform it's going to hit more of
the<00:04:18.140> upper<00:04:18.410> quad<00:04:18.650> and<00:04:18.859> of<00:04:18.950> course<00:04:19.190> end<00:04:19.970> up<00:04:20.780> with

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
the upper quad and of course end up with

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.709 
the upper quad and of course end up with
quads<00:04:21.169> like<00:04:21.500> that
