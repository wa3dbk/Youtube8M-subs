00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
Excel in my opinion not only is it one

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.409 
Excel in my opinion not only is it one
of<00:00:27.740> the<00:00:27.800> best<00:00:28.009> built<00:00:28.250> lorries<00:00:28.669> it's<00:00:29.000> also<00:00:29.210> one

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:29.419 
of the best built lorries it's also one

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:32.019 
of the best built lorries it's also one
of<00:00:29.449> the<00:00:29.599> greatest<00:00:29.810> looking<00:00:30.230> as<00:00:30.349> well<00:00:30.849> it<00:00:31.849> was<00:00:32.000> a

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
of the greatest looking as well it was a

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:33.880 
of the greatest looking as well it was a
shame<00:00:32.300> to<00:00:32.449> see<00:00:32.599> our<00:00:32.750> old<00:00:32.960> lorry<00:00:33.290> go<00:00:33.590> it<00:00:33.770> was

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
shame to see our old lorry go it was

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.619 
shame to see our old lorry go it was
such<00:00:34.040> an<00:00:34.160> essential<00:00:34.489> part<00:00:34.820> of<00:00:34.910> our<00:00:35.059> team<00:00:35.360> and

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:35.629 
such an essential part of our team and

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:38.049 
such an essential part of our team and
also<00:00:35.920> for<00:00:36.920> us<00:00:37.040> having<00:00:37.370> some<00:00:37.579> of<00:00:37.699> the<00:00:37.790> best

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
also for us having some of the best

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.030 
also for us having some of the best
prize<00:00:38.360> dressage<00:00:38.809> horses<00:00:39.110> in<00:00:39.260> England<00:00:39.589> it<00:00:39.949> was

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
prize dressage horses in England it was

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.950 
prize dressage horses in England it was
also<00:00:40.370> a<00:00:40.400> very<00:00:40.580> important<00:00:41.089> safety<00:00:41.300> factor<00:00:41.839> to

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
also a very important safety factor to

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.020 
also a very important safety factor to
be<00:00:42.080> driving<00:00:42.410> our<00:00:42.530> horses<00:00:42.739> around<00:00:43.070> in<00:00:43.280> that<00:00:43.460> so

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
be driving our horses around in that so

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.270 
be driving our horses around in that so
really<00:00:44.570> our<00:00:44.600> only<00:00:44.930> choice<00:00:45.230> was<00:00:45.589> the<00:00:45.860> upgrade

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
really our only choice was the upgrade

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.740 
really our only choice was the upgrade
which<00:00:46.579> we<00:00:46.970> are<00:00:47.030> obviously<00:00:47.239> very<00:00:47.329> delighted

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
which we are obviously very delighted

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.500 
which we are obviously very delighted
with<00:00:47.989> for<00:00:48.860> me<00:00:48.980> the<00:00:49.220> safety<00:00:49.610> aspect<00:00:50.030> of<00:00:50.239> the

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
with for me the safety aspect of the

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.600 
with for me the safety aspect of the
Sonic<00:00:50.989> is<00:00:51.140> so<00:00:51.440> important<00:00:52.040> and<00:00:52.220> that's<00:00:52.309> why<00:00:52.579> I

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
Sonic is so important and that's why I

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.390 
Sonic is so important and that's why I
decided<00:00:52.909> to<00:00:53.300> opt<00:00:53.720> for<00:00:53.839> the<00:00:54.019> side<00:00:54.290> ramp<00:00:54.920> option

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:55.400 
decided to opt for the side ramp option

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.340 
decided to opt for the side ramp option
because<00:00:55.699> this<00:00:55.850> is<00:00:56.000> so<00:00:56.239> much<00:00:56.269> easier<00:00:56.989> to<00:00:57.049> load

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
because this is so much easier to load

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.979 
because this is so much easier to load
the<00:00:57.530> horses<00:00:57.650> and<00:00:58.159> therefore<00:00:59.150> we<00:00:59.720> can<00:00:59.869> have

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
the horses and therefore we can have

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.289 
the horses and therefore we can have
them<00:01:00.140> facing<00:01:00.500> backwards<00:01:00.979> which<00:01:01.610> leads<00:01:01.970> on<00:01:02.180> to

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:02.299 
them facing backwards which leads on to

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:04.030 
them facing backwards which leads on to
really<00:01:02.869> my<00:01:02.989> point<00:01:03.199> that<00:01:03.350> if<00:01:03.530> you<00:01:03.650> suddenly

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
really my point that if you suddenly

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.490 
really my point that if you suddenly
have<00:01:04.309> a<00:01:04.580> braking<00:01:05.030> issue<00:01:05.210> then<00:01:05.960> obviously<00:01:06.140> the

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
have a braking issue then obviously the

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.310 
have a braking issue then obviously the
horses<00:01:06.860> are<00:01:07.070> prepared<00:01:07.520> a<00:01:07.640> lot<00:01:07.820> easier<00:01:08.270> to<00:01:08.869> be

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
horses are prepared a lot easier to be

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.960 
horses are prepared a lot easier to be
upright<00:01:09.680> in<00:01:09.860> a<00:01:09.950> braking<00:01:10.280> situation<00:01:10.760> because

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
upright in a braking situation because

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.280 
upright in a braking situation because
they<00:01:11.030> can<00:01:11.150> sit<00:01:11.330> back<00:01:11.479> on<00:01:11.630> their<00:01:11.840> hogs<00:01:12.049> and

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
they can sit back on their hogs and

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.020 
they can sit back on their hogs and
they've<00:01:12.799> got<00:01:12.979> the<00:01:13.100> weight<00:01:13.250> behind<00:01:13.460> them<00:01:13.759> of

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
they've got the weight behind them of

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.910 
they've got the weight behind them of
the<00:01:14.689> front<00:01:14.900> of<00:01:14.990> the<00:01:15.080> lorry<00:01:15.290> so<00:01:15.500> that<00:01:15.650> they<00:01:15.770> can

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
the front of the lorry so that they can

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.160 
the front of the lorry so that they can
really<00:01:16.369> like<00:01:16.580> balance<00:01:16.939> themselves<00:01:17.420> the<00:01:18.020> other

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
really like balance themselves the other

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.109 
really like balance themselves the other
thing<00:01:18.439> that<00:01:18.470> is<00:01:19.070> really<00:01:19.310> important<00:01:19.790> to<00:01:19.850> us<00:01:19.970> is

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
thing that is really important to us is

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.420 
thing that is really important to us is
having<00:01:20.450> now<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:20.630> full<00:01:21.080> height<00:01:21.439> for<00:01:22.159> the<00:01:22.220> ramp

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
having now the full height for the ramp

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.620 
having now the full height for the ramp
to<00:01:22.520> come<00:01:22.759> down<00:01:22.939> because<00:01:23.180> this<00:01:23.270> is<00:01:23.420> so<00:01:23.570> much

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
to come down because this is so much

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:24.940 
to come down because this is so much
easier<00:01:23.750> especially<00:01:24.320> when<00:01:24.439> you're<00:01:24.560> travelling

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
easier especially when you're travelling

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.499 
easier especially when you're travelling
larger<00:01:25.310> horses<00:01:25.640> like<00:01:25.820> some<00:01:26.030> of<00:01:26.150> the<00:01:26.210> ones<00:01:26.359> we

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
larger horses like some of the ones we

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:29.319 
larger horses like some of the ones we
have<00:01:26.719> here<00:01:26.829> 17<00:01:27.829> 3<00:01:28.159> hands<00:01:28.549> here<00:01:28.670> it's<00:01:29.090> a<00:01:29.179> big

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
have here 17 3 hands here it's a big

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:31.870 
have here 17 3 hands here it's a big
horse<00:01:29.600> so<00:01:29.929> again<00:01:30.710> with<00:01:30.890> a<00:01:30.920> very<00:01:31.009> low<00:01:31.429> sloping

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
horse so again with a very low sloping

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.760 
horse so again with a very low sloping
ramp<00:01:32.030> it<00:01:32.210> makes<00:01:32.420> loading<00:01:32.840> a<00:01:32.869> lot<00:01:33.259> easier<00:01:33.740> for

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
ramp it makes loading a lot easier for

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.830 
ramp it makes loading a lot easier for
those<00:01:34.009> types<00:01:34.249> of<00:01:34.369> horses<00:01:34.759> the<00:01:34.969> other<00:01:35.630> thing

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
those types of horses the other thing

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.359 
those types of horses the other thing
that<00:01:35.869> we<00:01:36.079> decided<00:01:36.439> was<00:01:36.679> to<00:01:36.829> opt<00:01:37.009> out<00:01:37.159> of<00:01:37.219> having

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
that we decided was to opt out of having

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.429 
that we decided was to opt out of having
a<00:01:37.670> window<00:01:37.909> in<00:01:38.179> the<00:01:38.270> bulkhead<00:01:38.600> because<00:01:39.049> I<00:01:39.079> felt

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
a window in the bulkhead because I felt

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:41.889 
a window in the bulkhead because I felt
that<00:01:39.499> this<00:01:39.740> wasn't<00:01:39.979> really<00:01:40.609> a<00:01:40.640> good<00:01:41.569> safety

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
that this wasn't really a good safety

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.410 
that this wasn't really a good safety
aspect<00:01:42.439> because<00:01:42.590> horses<00:01:43.130> can<00:01:43.399> back<00:01:44.119> in

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
aspect because horses can back in

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.179 
aspect because horses can back in
lorries<00:01:44.840> they<00:01:45.079> can<00:01:45.229> kick<00:01:45.439> out<00:01:45.590> in<00:01:45.799> lorries<00:01:46.159> and

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
lorries they can kick out in lorries and

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.700 
lorries they can kick out in lorries and
I<00:01:46.700> didn't<00:01:46.999> really<00:01:47.270> want<00:01:47.569> to<00:01:47.659> meet<00:01:48.350> one<00:01:48.530> of<00:01:48.560> the

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
I didn't really want to meet one of the

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.200 
I didn't really want to meet one of the
horses<00:01:49.039> hooves<00:01:49.219> coming<00:01:49.579> through<00:01:49.759> the<00:01:49.880> window

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
horses hooves coming through the window

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.270 
horses hooves coming through the window
so<00:01:50.390> we<00:01:50.840> opted<00:01:51.170> out<00:01:51.350> of<00:01:51.409> that<00:01:51.619> and<00:01:51.920> I<00:01:52.009> think<00:01:52.069> that

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
so we opted out of that and I think that

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.370 
so we opted out of that and I think that
was<00:01:52.460> a<00:01:52.490> very<00:01:52.759> good<00:01:53.359> idea<00:01:53.389> from<00:01:53.810> a<00:01:53.929> safety<00:01:54.229> point

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
was a very good idea from a safety point

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.809 
was a very good idea from a safety point
because<00:01:54.740> we<00:01:54.950> actually<00:01:55.130> have<00:01:55.460> asked

00:01:55.809 --> 00:01:55.819 
because we actually have asked

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:58.209 
because we actually have asked
specifically<00:01:56.600> to<00:01:56.719> have<00:01:56.960> a<00:01:56.990> camera<00:01:57.799> fitted<00:01:58.009> on

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
specifically to have a camera fitted on

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:00.010 
specifically to have a camera fitted on
the<00:01:58.310> dashboard<00:01:58.759> so<00:01:58.880> basically<00:01:59.270> as<00:01:59.450> well<00:01:59.630> it's

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
the dashboard so basically as well it's

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.539 
the dashboard so basically as well it's
very<00:02:00.259> safe<00:02:00.499> when<00:02:00.740> you're<00:02:00.859> driving<00:02:01.100> you<00:02:01.340> don't

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
very safe when you're driving you don't

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:02.919 
very safe when you're driving you don't
have<00:02:01.729> to<00:02:01.850> turn<00:02:02.030> around<00:02:02.210> if<00:02:02.450> you<00:02:02.539> feel<00:02:02.689> anything

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 
have to turn around if you feel anything

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:04.330 
have to turn around if you feel anything
going<00:02:03.109> wrong<00:02:03.170> you've<00:02:03.649> got<00:02:03.770> your<00:02:03.889> camera<00:02:04.009> right

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
going wrong you've got your camera right

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.520 
going wrong you've got your camera right
there<00:02:04.369> on<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:04.789> dashboard<00:02:05.240> and<00:02:05.420> it's<00:02:06.319> there

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
there on the dashboard and it's there

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.790 
there on the dashboard and it's there
for<00:02:06.679> you<00:02:06.740> to<00:02:06.889> see<00:02:07.959> some<00:02:08.959> people<00:02:09.170> think<00:02:09.530> that

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
for you to see some people think that

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.790 
for you to see some people think that

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
that you know not only when you're in in

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:55.830 
that you know not only when you're in in
Great<00:02:54.970> Britain<00:02:55.060> but<00:02:55.270> when<00:02:55.360> you're<00:02:55.480> out<00:02:55.600> of<00:02:55.720> the

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
thing is about the the sonic as well you

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.420 
thing is about the the sonic as well you
know<00:03:07.630> when<00:03:07.810> you're<00:03:07.960> not<00:03:08.650> only<00:03:08.800> travelling<00:03:09.280> to

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
know when you're not only travelling to

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.430 
know when you're not only travelling to
horses<00:03:09.730> we're<00:03:09.940> very<00:03:10.120> often<00:03:10.450> we<00:03:10.570> have<00:03:10.780> a<00:03:10.810> driver

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
horses we're very often we have a driver

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.400 
horses we're very often we have a driver
and<00:03:11.890> a<00:03:12.220> rider<00:03:12.490> sometimes<00:03:13.240> a<00:03:13.330> groom<00:03:13.600> having

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
and a rider sometimes a groom having

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:15.480 
and a rider sometimes a groom having
this<00:03:14.500> little<00:03:14.620> bit<00:03:14.830> of<00:03:14.890> space<00:03:15.100> at<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.340> back

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.490 
this little bit of space at the back

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.640 
this little bit of space at the back
here<00:03:15.760> makes<00:03:16.060> things<00:03:16.330> really<00:03:16.660> easy<00:03:17.230> for<00:03:17.590> us

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
here makes things really easy for us

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:18.840 
here makes things really easy for us
because<00:03:17.920> it<00:03:18.010> means<00:03:18.100> there's<00:03:18.340> somewhere<00:03:18.670> to

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
because it means there's somewhere to

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.220 
because it means there's somewhere to
change<00:03:19.180> if<00:03:19.390> it's<00:03:19.540> pouring<00:03:19.870> down<00:03:20.020> with<00:03:20.080> rain

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
change if it's pouring down with rain

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.140 
change if it's pouring down with rain
somewhere<00:03:21.100> really<00:03:21.400> safe<00:03:21.640> to<00:03:21.790> store<00:03:22.030> your

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
somewhere really safe to store your

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.610 
somewhere really safe to store your
attack<00:03:22.450> and<00:03:22.780> also<00:03:23.170> somewhere<00:03:23.440> for<00:03:23.530> your

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
attack and also somewhere for your
