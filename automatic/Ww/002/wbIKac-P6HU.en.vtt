00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
when it comes to power lifting I have

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.590 
when it comes to power lifting I have
found<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:19.100> really<00:00:20.100> interesting<00:00:20.699> connection

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
found a really interesting connection

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.859 
found a really interesting connection
between<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.800> things<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.490> dislike<00:00:24.029> doing<00:00:24.750> the

between the things you dislike doing the
most<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:26.189> things<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.670> are<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.210> most

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
most and the things that are the most

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.099 
most and the things that are the most
helpful<00:00:28.070> for<00:00:29.269> your<00:00:30.269> improvement<00:00:30.929> in

helpful for your improvement in
enforcing<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.099> progress<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.880> so<00:00:33.270> I<00:00:33.600> kept

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
enforcing the progress and so I kept

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.920 
enforcing the progress and so I kept
that<00:00:34.079> in<00:00:34.200> mind<00:00:34.230> as<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:35.010> went<00:00:35.190> out<00:00:35.340> today<00:00:35.899> still<00:00:36.899> a

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
that in mind as I went out today still a

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.990 
that in mind as I went out today still a
little<00:00:37.079> bit<00:00:37.350> beat<00:00:37.530> up<00:00:37.559> after<00:00:37.920> last<00:00:38.760> night's

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
little bit beat up after last night's

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.680 
little bit beat up after last night's
squats<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.780> benching<00:00:40.879> just<00:00:41.879> again<00:00:42.239> it's<00:00:42.420> it's

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
squats and benching just again it's it's

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.920 
squats and benching just again it's it's
a<00:00:42.750> pretty<00:00:42.899> short<00:00:43.170> turnover<00:00:43.739> time<00:00:43.920> going<00:00:44.250> from

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
a pretty short turnover time going from

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.049 
a pretty short turnover time going from
relatively<00:00:45.930> heavy<00:00:46.170> squats<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.920> quite<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.910> bit

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
relatively heavy squats and quite a bit

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.709 
relatively heavy squats and quite a bit
of<00:00:48.149> volume<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.809> same<00:00:49.260> with<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.590> benching<00:00:49.980> to

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
of volume and same with the benching to

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.689 
of volume and same with the benching to
some<00:00:51.719> heavy<00:00:51.899> pulls<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.410> garage<00:00:52.620> but<00:00:53.129> you

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
some heavy pulls in the garage but you

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.240 
some heavy pulls in the garage but you
know<00:00:53.820> that's<00:00:54.320> the<00:00:55.320> way<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.680> structure<00:00:56.129> my

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
know that's the way that I structure my

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.040 
know that's the way that I structure my
training<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.360> helped<00:00:57.600> really<00:00:57.840> helps

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
training and it helped really helps

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.260 
training and it helped really helps
build<00:00:58.260> mental<00:00:58.620> toughness<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.270> especially

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
build mental toughness and especially

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.290 
build mental toughness and especially
when<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.750> combine<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.879> short<00:01:02.879> turnover

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
when you combine that short turnover

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.590 
when you combine that short turnover
time<00:01:03.480> with<00:01:03.780> something<00:01:04.199> as<00:01:04.439> horrendous<00:01:04.769> and

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
time with something as horrendous and

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.560 
time with something as horrendous and
hate-filled<00:01:06.600> has<00:01:07.400> paws<00:01:08.400> deadlifts<00:01:09.090> this<00:01:09.420> is

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
hate-filled has paws deadlifts this is

hate-filled has paws deadlifts this is
my<00:01:09.750> least<00:01:09.930> favorite<00:01:10.290> exercise<00:01:10.710> in<00:01:11.010> the

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
my least favorite exercise in the

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.890 
my least favorite exercise in the
history<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.700> universe<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.360> think<00:01:12.689> they're

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
history of the universe I think they're

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.899 
history of the universe I think they're
the<00:01:12.930> most<00:01:13.110> evil<00:01:13.500> things<00:01:13.890> ever<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.490> hate<00:01:14.729> them

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
the most evil things ever I hate them

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.670 
the most evil things ever I hate them
more<00:01:15.030> than<00:01:15.210> bench<00:01:15.420> pressing<00:01:15.840> because<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.259> can't

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
more than bench pressing because I can't

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.440 
more than bench pressing because I can't
just<00:01:16.890> use<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.189> excuse<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.640> I'm<00:01:17.850> bad<00:01:18.060> at<00:01:18.240> them

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
just use the excuse that I'm bad at them

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.020 
just use the excuse that I'm bad at them
they're<00:01:18.659> just<00:01:18.900> ridiculously<00:01:19.770> hard<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.640> they

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
they're just ridiculously hard and they

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.140 
they're just ridiculously hard and they
hurt<00:01:21.240> your<00:01:21.390> soul<00:01:21.650> but<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:23.040> will<00:01:23.490> also<00:01:23.729> say<00:01:23.939> that

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
hurt your soul but I will also say that

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.969 
hurt your soul but I will also say that
they're<00:01:24.450> probably<00:01:24.780> one<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.470> best<00:01:25.650> things

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
they're probably one of the best things

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.590 
they're probably one of the best things
for<00:01:26.150> improving<00:01:27.350> your<00:01:28.350> actual<00:01:29.040> strength<00:01:29.540> as<00:01:30.540> a

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
for improving your actual strength as a

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.450 
for improving your actual strength as a
sumo<00:01:31.049> puller<00:01:31.259> especially<00:01:31.920> off<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.220> ground

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
sumo puller especially off the ground

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.179 
sumo puller especially off the ground
and<00:01:32.790> maintaining<00:01:33.509> those<00:01:34.049> starting<00:01:34.710> positions

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
and maintaining those starting positions

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.060 
and maintaining those starting positions
a<00:01:35.850> lot<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:36.689> times<00:01:36.869> people<00:01:37.110> will<00:01:37.290> miss<00:01:37.680> their

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
a lot of times people will miss their

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.670 
a lot of times people will miss their
sumo<00:01:38.729> poles<00:01:39.030> because<00:01:39.450> they<00:01:39.990> sacrifice<00:01:40.650> their

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
sumo poles because they sacrifice their

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.660 
sumo poles because they sacrifice their
starting<00:01:41.460> position<00:01:42.000> right<00:01:42.659> off<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.990> floor

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
starting position right off the floor

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.920 
starting position right off the floor
for<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.700> sake<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.060> getting<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.780> weight

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
for the sake of getting the weight

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.719 
for the sake of getting the weight
moving<00:01:46.320> they<00:01:46.470> sacrifice<00:01:47.040> their<00:01:47.070> positioning

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
moving they sacrifice their positioning

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.190 
moving they sacrifice their positioning
for<00:01:47.790> momentum<00:01:48.210> something<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:48.750> was<00:01:48.899> talking

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
for momentum something I was talking

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.179 
for momentum something I was talking
about<00:01:49.409> last<00:01:49.680> night<00:01:50.090> in<00:01:51.090> my<00:01:51.560> in<00:01:52.560> my<00:01:52.619> squatting

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
about last night in my in my squatting

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.580 
about last night in my in my squatting
video<00:01:53.399> where<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.780> was<00:01:54.990> talking<00:01:55.200> about<00:01:55.229> more

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
video where I was talking about more

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.880 
video where I was talking about more
consistency<00:01:56.130> throughout<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.729> rep<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.930> and

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
consistency throughout the rep and and

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.850 
consistency throughout the rep and and
you<00:01:59.250> know<00:01:59.280> not<00:02:00.090> wanting<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.420> sacrifice<00:02:00.960> your

you know not wanting to sacrifice your

you know not wanting to sacrifice your
position<00:02:02.759> for<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.180> momentum<00:02:03.659> because<00:02:03.840> it's

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
position for that momentum because it's

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.230 
position for that momentum because it's
a<00:02:04.409> short-term<00:02:04.979> gain<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.520> might<00:02:05.790> be<00:02:05.880> able<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.090> get

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
a short-term gain I might be able to get

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.389 
a short-term gain I might be able to get

firing at the same time but generally

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.929 
firing at the same time but generally
staying<00:02:18.629> in<00:02:18.870> that<00:02:18.900> better<00:02:19.260> position<00:02:19.829> once<00:02:20.760> you

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:20.939 
staying in that better position once you

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:22.699 
staying in that better position once you
get<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.209> bar<00:02:21.390> moving<00:02:21.599> you<00:02:21.780> can<00:02:21.930> accelerate<00:02:22.319> up

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
get the bar moving you can accelerate up

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.710 
get the bar moving you can accelerate up
like<00:02:23.099> you<00:02:23.250> see<00:02:23.489> it<00:02:23.640> really<00:02:24.000> gets<00:02:24.120> emphasized

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
like you see it really gets emphasized

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.809 
like you see it really gets emphasized
in<00:02:24.989> this<00:02:25.140> pause<00:02:25.349> deadlift<00:02:25.860> we're<00:02:26.370> at<00:02:26.459> speeds

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
in this pause deadlift we're at speeds

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.110 
in this pause deadlift we're at speeds
all<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.180> way<00:02:27.239> through<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.599> lockout<00:02:28.079> and

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
all the way through to the lockout and

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.460 
all the way through to the lockout and
more<00:02:30.120> time<00:02:30.329> under<00:02:30.569> tension<00:02:30.599> on<00:02:31.019> the<00:02:31.110> suckiest

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
more time under tension on the suckiest

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.199 
more time under tension on the suckiest
part<00:02:31.709> of<00:02:31.769> the<00:02:31.860> lift<00:02:32.010> it's<00:02:32.250> one<00:02:32.430> of<00:02:32.519> the<00:02:32.640> fastest

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
part of the lift it's one of the fastest

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.300 
part of the lift it's one of the fastest
ways<00:02:33.390> that<00:02:33.690> I<00:02:33.720> know<00:02:33.810> to<00:02:33.989> really<00:02:34.560> bring<00:02:34.890> up<00:02:35.099> a

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
ways that I know to really bring up a

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.819 
ways that I know to really bring up a
lagging<00:02:35.519> weakness<00:02:36.030> so<00:02:36.359> I<00:02:36.659> hate<00:02:37.200> those<00:02:37.379> lifts

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
lagging weakness so I hate those lifts

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:39.050 
lagging weakness so I hate those lifts
but<00:02:38.010> at<00:02:38.129> the<00:02:38.220> same<00:02:38.400> time<00:02:38.579> they're<00:02:38.760> really<00:02:38.909> good

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
but at the same time they're really good

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.559 
but at the same time they're really good
for<00:02:39.180> me<00:02:39.299> and<00:02:39.420> I<00:02:39.450> decided<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:39.930> use<00:02:41.030> 585<00:02:42.030> for<00:02:42.420> all

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
for me and I decided to use 585 for all

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:43.849 
for me and I decided to use 585 for all
those<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:42.989> I<00:02:43.019> went<00:02:43.170> beltless<00:02:43.500> because<00:02:43.829> I

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:43.859 
those and I went beltless because I

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:45.770 
those and I went beltless because I
don't<00:02:44.129> ever<00:02:44.340> wear<00:02:45.060> a<00:02:45.090> belt<00:02:45.329> from<00:02:45.420> my<00:02:45.569> paws

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
don't ever wear a belt from my paws

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.259 
don't ever wear a belt from my paws
deads<00:02:46.140> it's<00:02:46.409> just<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.769> way<00:02:46.890> that<00:02:46.980> I<00:02:47.069> do<00:02:47.129> it<00:02:47.370> um

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
deads it's just the way that I do it um

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.180 
deads it's just the way that I do it um
I'm<00:02:49.049> probably<00:02:49.260> gonna<00:02:49.409> keep<00:02:49.650> those<00:02:49.769> in<00:02:49.980> for<00:02:50.159> a

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
I'm probably gonna keep those in for a

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.399 
I'm probably gonna keep those in for a
while<00:02:50.370> too<00:02:50.579> I've<00:02:51.000> noticed<00:02:51.420> my<00:02:51.569> benching<00:02:52.019> one

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:52.409 
while too I've noticed my benching one

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:53.720 
while too I've noticed my benching one
of<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.620> reasons<00:02:52.889> I<00:02:53.010> think<00:02:53.040> it's<00:02:53.310> been<00:02:53.430> going

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
of the reasons I think it's been going

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.759 
of the reasons I think it's been going
up<00:02:53.849> so<00:02:54.090> well<00:02:54.299> in<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.810> last<00:02:55.159> few<00:02:56.159> weeks<00:02:56.370> is<00:02:56.670> I

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
up so well in the last few weeks is I

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.309 
up so well in the last few weeks is I
broke<00:02:58.769> myself<00:02:59.010> out<00:02:59.519> of<00:02:59.579> the<00:03:00.209> law<00:03:00.959> of

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
broke myself out of the law of

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.059 
broke myself out of the law of
diminishing<00:03:01.980> returns<00:03:02.220> where<00:03:02.879> I<00:03:03.840> would<00:03:04.650> do<00:03:04.950> the

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
diminishing returns where I would do the

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.009 
diminishing returns where I would do the
same<00:03:05.099> you<00:03:05.940> know<00:03:06.060> I've<00:03:06.299> talked<00:03:06.750> to<00:03:06.840> a<00:03:06.870> few

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
same you know I've talked to a few

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.839 
same you know I've talked to a few
people<00:03:07.079> about<00:03:07.409> this<00:03:07.650> before<00:03:08.010> I've<00:03:08.400> always

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
people about this before I've always

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:10.729 
people about this before I've always
been<00:03:09.060> very<00:03:09.239> big<00:03:09.540> on<00:03:09.750> structuring<00:03:10.620> your

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
been very big on structuring your

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.449 
been very big on structuring your
lifting<00:03:11.340> around<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.790> core<00:03:12.000> movements<00:03:12.650> and<00:03:13.650> I

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
lifting around the core movements and I

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.099 
lifting around the core movements and I
think<00:03:14.699> that<00:03:14.970> adding<00:03:15.540> a<00:03:15.629> little<00:03:15.870> bit<00:03:15.989> of

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
think that adding a little bit of

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:17.869 
think that adding a little bit of
variation<00:03:16.410> with<00:03:16.919> my<00:03:17.069> bench<00:03:17.250> with<00:03:17.549> the<00:03:17.699> two

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:17.879 
variation with my bench with the two

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:19.430 
variation with my bench with the two
different<00:03:18.150> grips<00:03:18.419> which<00:03:18.629> I<00:03:18.840> have<00:03:19.019> my<00:03:19.169> my

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
different grips which I have my my

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.349 
different grips which I have my my
competition<00:03:19.949> grip<00:03:20.099> and<00:03:20.340> then<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.239> two

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
competition grip and then the two

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.000 
competition grip and then the two
variations<00:03:21.690> i<00:03:22.169> have<00:03:22.349> this<00:03:22.440> close<00:03:22.680> grip<00:03:22.889> that

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
variations i have this close grip that

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.470 
variations i have this close grip that
i've<00:03:23.129> been<00:03:23.160> working<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.609> lot<00:03:23.760> with<00:03:23.819> and<00:03:24.269> then<00:03:24.449> a

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
i've been working a lot with and then a

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.289 
i've been working a lot with and then a
wider<00:03:25.019> grip<00:03:25.349> and<00:03:26.160> it's<00:03:26.310> kind<00:03:26.519> of<00:03:26.639> helped<00:03:26.940> me<00:03:27.120> to

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
wider grip and it's kind of helped me to

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.300 
wider grip and it's kind of helped me to
work<00:03:27.480> on<00:03:27.629> the<00:03:27.780> bench<00:03:27.989> with<00:03:28.739> different

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
work on the bench with different

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.800 
work on the bench with different
stimulus<00:03:29.730> without<00:03:30.120> getting<00:03:30.389> too<00:03:30.510> far<00:03:30.660> away

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
stimulus without getting too far away

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.599 
stimulus without getting too far away
from<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.079> movement<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:31.709> so<00:03:31.980> i'll<00:03:32.310> be<00:03:32.489> doing

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
from the movement and so i'll be doing

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.939 
from the movement and so i'll be doing
the<00:03:32.760> same<00:03:32.940> thing<00:03:33.180> with<00:03:33.329> those<00:03:33.510> paws<00:03:33.780> deads<00:03:34.109> if

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:34.949 
the same thing with those paws deads if

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:38.599 
the same thing with those paws deads if
I<00:03:35.099> can<00:03:35.449> stay<00:03:36.449> consistent<00:03:37.079> enough<00:03:37.230> to<00:03:37.709> and<00:03:38.220> and

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
I can stay consistent enough to and and

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.569 
I can stay consistent enough to and and
be<00:03:39.030> disciplined<00:03:39.569> enough<00:03:39.900> to<00:03:39.959> do<00:03:40.290> it<00:03:40.579> you

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
be disciplined enough to do it you

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.490 
be disciplined enough to do it you
notice<00:03:41.790> I'm<00:03:41.879> wearing<00:03:42.030> different<00:03:42.720> clothes<00:03:43.169> for

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
notice I'm wearing different clothes for

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.500 
notice I'm wearing different clothes for
this<00:03:43.680> benching<00:03:44.280> I<00:03:44.459> had<00:03:44.849> an<00:03:45.060> a<00:03:45.180> cappella

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
this benching I had an a cappella

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.659 
this benching I had an a cappella
rehearsal<00:03:45.690> in<00:03:46.199> between<00:03:46.889> these<00:03:47.040> two<00:03:47.280> mini

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
rehearsal in between these two mini

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.819 
rehearsal in between these two mini
workouts<00:03:48.090> so<00:03:48.269> I<00:03:48.299> did<00:03:48.569> the<00:03:48.810> deadlifts<00:03:49.680> in<00:03:49.739> the

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
workouts so I did the deadlifts in the

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.050 
workouts so I did the deadlifts in the
morning<00:03:50.129> and<00:03:50.220> then<00:03:50.310> I<00:03:50.370> waited<00:03:50.609> a<00:03:50.669> few<00:03:50.790> hours

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
morning and then I waited a few hours

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.819 
morning and then I waited a few hours
and<00:03:51.180> came<00:03:51.359> back<00:03:51.389> out<00:03:51.780> and<00:03:51.810> hit<00:03:52.349> my<00:03:52.500> closer

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
and came back out and hit my closer

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:55.879 
and came back out and hit my closer
attention<00:03:53.659> but<00:03:54.659> there<00:03:54.840> you<00:03:54.930> see<00:03:55.139> the<00:03:55.169> workout
