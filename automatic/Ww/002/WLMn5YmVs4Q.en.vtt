00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:11.150
 hello and welcome to the battle 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:13.999
 On the high seas we can see starts 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:17.119
 right on a ship and have to 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:19.310
 fight british chics and am 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.429
 then then enemy captain 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:26.000
 may here at the beginning right in the 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:28.550
 first stage you have to open the deck of 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.289
 all today we liberate see here 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.809
 can the red strikes that is 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.879
 just like again arena at digi 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.219
 keys engineers may not be in it 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:40.039
 stand that makes you harm about 300 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.960
 that means that you have the opponents 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:44.780
 kill and in addition to the 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.140
 hit as good as it gets evasive 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.820
 otherwise you will not succeed 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.550
 if he gets enough of these then 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.769
 killed sailors appears so one 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.750
 less between post and after you 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.550
 he uses the developments 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.789
 cannon you see in the left picture 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.359
 could and will go to the next one 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.359
 Ship shot 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.860
 the small typical rossis done now 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.260
 and now we use the cannon right away 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.280
 and let's shoot over it 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.280
 next ship 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.920
 are landed on the next victory 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.829
 you also have to continue the sailors so 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.469
 the better to kill and beat 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:52.409
 dodge and then appears 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:56.039
 up as a kind of figure of the ye 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.659
 then you can jump to the next one and 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:59.429
 there is nothing in the room yet 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.929
 myself or something I have then too 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:02.579
 ever after maybe he is something 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:04.679
 but that's only the next one 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.569
 So ship saves you the time 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:08.220
 just the sailors after I'm with the 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:10.349
 cannon shot over it and then 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.599
 She uses her with a gear 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.940
 marks the rope and you're swinging 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.260
 Just get on the next ship 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.360
 then expect you already 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.980
 less between the adversary must their 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.269
 just do it 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.879
 and can see here this position 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:28.829
 again and again bombs and barrels and there 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.170
 had to dodge so the solid the 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:33.090
 have a fuse then you see 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.950
 just how long have time before you 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.810
 then you have to explode something 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.940
 Do not move away from it so much 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.980
 it suffers harm and the bomb the 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.769
 He will also have a small stuff 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.540
 just above you there you also see as 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.530
 goes up and then , of course, too 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.530
 do not stand in the fire 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:03.010
 after me then the opponents above 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.570
 have done if they so small 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.610
 This is unfortunately from 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:11.960
 collect as last the first then goes 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:13.550
 Just go down and kill 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.770
 the next one is the one 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.990
 all three opponents on the ship and all 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.940
 Three may have defeated them dry 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:23.620
 such a small keg which her in the 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.620
 ignite connection is 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.790
 has cut we just fight against the 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.730
 last of which as previously discussed 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.370
 clean and it is a relatively annoying 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.379
 fight with each hit so with 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.140
 every shot you give yourself will 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:15.349
 also flung back 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:17.620
 otherwise just kill the mob 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:19.579
 the explosions and then the 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.889
 ignite explosive vest and now 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:24.050
 very important as soon as they are on 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:26.210
 has triggered by the launches in 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.220
 counter and that has 15 seconds around 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.320
 to leave the ship and that 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.000
 right 50 seconds so then there is 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.919
 not a small explosion but that 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.330
 you should blow up the entire ship 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:36.020
 the ship can not make it 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.220
 leave 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.220
 so die here too 

00:05:09.859 --> 00:05:14.429
 if you then gave the conversation 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:15.929
 He shoots him with the cannon still on 

00:05:14.429 --> 00:05:17.909
 the last ship where he is now against 

00:05:15.929 --> 00:05:19.949
 captain kempf that he first flowers since 

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:22.649
 I use the time all the little TrÃ¤sch 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:25.319
 pug and then he gives still directly 

00:05:22.649 --> 00:05:29.159
 came on the right side of the ship 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:31.409
 put a little knife and through in 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:34.019
 Woods could pull out then get 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:35.729
 an additional action button and 

00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:38.639
 so you can also boss 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:40.919
 assures he had had with the 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:42.719
 video is looking forward to the scenario it expects 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:44.009
 comes with 53 on the live cd but it 

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:45.689
 definitely pays off that too 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:48.179
 because it is a lot of fun and fun 

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:49.949
 the scenarios if you dammann the un dammann 

00:05:48.179 --> 00:05:51.089
 reports also give in a short time very much 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:53.279
 many points 

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:56.099
 also because of that because in each 

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:58.649
 Scenario yes an additional task installed 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:00.089
 is that just to see the interface 

00:05:58.649 --> 00:06:01.169
 we have a certain time around now 

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:02.969
 to kill the post 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:05.579
 and if he does that in addition 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:07.319
 he gets another 30 extra points thus 

00:06:05.579 --> 00:06:09.629
 Do you really make an alternative 

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:11.789
 the quiet German star because he just 

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:13.589
 can come very fast points 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:16.889
 can and gels in the treasure chest 

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:19.439
 which then drop in the men scenario 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:22.429
 can then up to a third with a 

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:22.429
 level 5 16
