thousand<00:01:27.640> times<00:01:27.820> better<00:01:28.119> it<00:01:29.080> certainly<00:01:30.810> makes

the car look so much tougher and they're
just<00:01:35.409> I<00:01:36.000> think<00:01:37.000> it<00:01:37.330> looks<00:01:37.509> fantastic<00:01:37.720> it

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470

lack of articulation in those areas his

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.190 
lack of articulation in those areas his

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
degrees they can be moved also outwards

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.150

sort<00:05:22.520> of<00:05:22.610> to<00:05:22.820> the<00:05:22.940> side<00:05:23.150> and<00:05:23.420> inwards<00:05:23.930> and<00:05:24.230> we

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 
sort of to the side and inwards and we

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.750 
sort of to the side and inwards and we
also<00:05:25.280> see<00:05:25.700> articulation<00:05:26.690> at<00:05:26.900> the<00:05:27.050> elbows<00:05:27.760> just

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:28.760 
also see articulation at the elbows just

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.200 
also see articulation at the elbows just
here<00:05:28.970> so<00:05:29.270> he's<00:05:29.980> considering<00:05:30.980> his<00:05:31.970> lack<00:05:32.180> of

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
here so he's considering his lack of

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.720 
here so he's considering his lack of
articulation<00:05:33.020> elsewhere<00:05:33.440> he<00:05:33.920> has<00:05:34.100> quite<00:05:34.370> he

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:34.730 
articulation elsewhere he has quite he

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.650 
articulation elsewhere he has quite he
definitely<00:05:35.540> makes<00:05:35.750> up<00:05:36.020> in<00:05:36.860> his<00:05:37.490> arms<00:05:37.880> which

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
definitely makes up in his arms which

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:48.510 
definitely makes up in his arms which
proves<00:05:39.380> quite<00:05:39.650> a<00:05:39.680> bit<00:05:39.890> of<00:05:40.690> pose<00:05:41.690> ability

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:24.350 
look at it compared to a hot rod so you

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.830 
look at it compared to a hot rod so you
can<00:07:24.560> see<00:07:24.770> he's<00:07:25.430> not<00:07:25.669> the<00:07:25.760> biggest<00:07:26.000> character

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.200 
but he's not the smallest either he's
about<00:07:29.330> average<00:07:29.750> size<00:07:30.460> okay<00:07:31.460> this<00:07:31.790> is<00:07:31.970> shredder

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:32.210
