00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650 
okay we're going to show the coma and

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.160 
okay we're going to show the coma and
the<00:00:01.860> only<00:00:02.070> oil<00:00:02.639> treatment<00:00:03.090> in<00:00:03.179> Austin<00:00:03.540> we've

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
the only oil treatment in Austin we've

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.539 
the only oil treatment in Austin we've
got<00:00:04.319> a<00:00:04.350> pressure<00:00:04.620> break<00:00:04.920> machine<00:00:05.220> the

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
got a pressure break machine the

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.110 
got a pressure break machine the
electric<00:00:06.420> motor<00:00:06.600> driving<00:00:06.870> a<00:00:07.259> wheel<00:00:07.500> and<00:00:08.120> we've

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
electric motor driving a wheel and we've

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.820 
electric motor driving a wheel and we've
got<00:00:09.300> testing<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:09.870> film<00:00:10.110> strength<00:00:10.380> to<00:00:10.559> see<00:00:10.740> how

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
got testing the film strength to see how

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.280 
got testing the film strength to see how
much<00:00:11.010> pressure<00:00:11.460> we<00:00:11.730> can<00:00:11.759> take<00:00:12.090> on<00:00:12.660> their<00:00:12.990> story

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
much pressure we can take on their story

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.959 
much pressure we can take on their story
is<00:00:13.469> you<00:00:13.620> first<00:00:13.830> just<00:00:14.219> put<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.400> regular<00:00:14.519> motor

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
is you first just put a regular motor

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.540 
is you first just put a regular motor
oil<00:00:15.210> in<00:00:15.420> 530

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.560 

see<00:00:20.670> that's<00:00:20.850> phoned<00:00:21.150> up<00:00:21.300> on<00:00:21.480> there<00:00:21.920> right<00:00:22.920> well

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
see that's phoned up on there right well

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.490 
see that's phoned up on there right well
I'm<00:00:24.570> just<00:00:24.690> going<00:00:24.870> to<00:00:24.930> bring<00:00:25.110> some<00:00:25.290> pressure

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
I'm just going to bring some pressure

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.790 
I'm just going to bring some pressure
down<00:00:25.650> here<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.130> see<00:00:26.310> where<00:00:26.460> it<00:00:26.670> goes

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.350 

and<00:00:33.800> you<00:00:33.860> can<00:00:33.980> see<00:00:34.190> we're<00:00:34.340> at<00:00:34.460> about<00:00:34.700> 30<00:00:35.120> pounds

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
and you can see we're at about 30 pounds

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.800 
and you can see we're at about 30 pounds
pressure<00:00:36.290> on<00:00:36.530> there<00:00:37.480> so<00:00:38.480> I'm<00:00:38.540> going<00:00:38.630> to<00:00:38.690> take

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:38.810 
pressure on there so I'm going to take

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:58.299 
pressure on there so I'm going to take
Heather's<00:00:39.410> product<00:00:40.220> in<00:00:40.370> here<00:00:40.520> first<00:00:57.100> and<00:00:58.100> you

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
Heather's product in here first and you

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.520 
Heather's product in here first and you
can<00:00:58.460> see<00:00:58.670> about<00:00:58.820> 40<00:00:59.270> pounds<00:00:59.510> of<00:00:59.840> pressure<00:01:00.230> on

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
can see about 40 pounds of pressure on

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.399 
can see about 40 pounds of pressure on
it<00:01:00.620> again<00:01:01.089> there<00:01:02.089> wasn't<00:01:02.269> much<00:01:02.510> difference<00:01:02.930> on

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
it again there wasn't much difference on

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:05.830 
it again there wasn't much difference on
there<00:01:03.650> and<00:01:04.159> as<00:01:04.699> far<00:01:04.850> as<00:01:04.970> your<00:01:05.089> cold<00:01:05.269> starts<00:01:05.690> go

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
there and as far as your cold starts go

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.300 
there and as far as your cold starts go
or<00:01:06.050> dry<00:01:06.230> starts<00:01:06.650> go<00:01:06.830> we're<00:01:07.010> just<00:01:07.040> going<00:01:07.280> to

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
or dry starts go we're just going to

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.410 
or dry starts go we're just going to
flip<00:01:07.430> the<00:01:07.610> switch<00:01:07.730> here<00:01:08.030> and<00:01:08.120> see<00:01:08.300> what

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
flip the switch here and see what

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.180 
flip the switch here and see what
happens<00:01:08.780> is<00:01:08.960> about<00:01:09.140> 40<00:01:09.470> pounds<00:01:09.620> pressure<00:01:10.010> on

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
happens is about 40 pounds pressure on

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:19.020 
happens is about 40 pounds pressure on

lubrication<00:02:26.260> on<00:02:26.819> there<00:02:27.819> and<00:02:28.000> that's<00:02:28.150> kind<00:02:28.750> of

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
lubrication on there and that's kind of

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.250 
lubrication on there and that's kind of
protection<00:02:29.260> you'll<00:02:29.379> see<00:02:29.560> in<00:02:29.650> your<00:02:29.709> engine

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
protection you'll see in your engine

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.869

yeah<00:02:32.260> unique<00:02:32.769> thing<00:02:32.980> about<00:02:33.010> ours<00:02:33.370> because<00:02:33.579> the

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
yeah unique thing about ours because the

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:35.879 
yeah unique thing about ours because the
metal<00:02:34.060> based<00:02:34.299> lubricant<00:02:34.840> is<00:02:35.200> you<00:02:35.439> run<00:02:35.680> it<00:02:35.799> with

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:35.889 
metal based lubricant is you run it with
