is<00:02:00.310> rolled<00:02:00.580> fondant<00:02:00.819> but<00:02:01.270> I<00:02:01.330> did<00:02:01.690> add

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
is rolled fondant but I did add

is rolled fondant but I did add
something<00:02:02.830> called<00:02:03.039> tylose<00:02:03.640> powder<00:02:03.670> to<00:02:04.420> it

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
something called tylose powder to it

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.350 
something called tylose powder to it
tylose<00:02:05.830> powder<00:02:05.860> is<00:02:06.369> an<00:02:06.489> ingredient<00:02:07.000> for<00:02:07.119> gum

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
tylose powder is an ingredient for gum

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.309 
tylose powder is an ingredient for gum
paste<00:02:07.599> gum<00:02:08.590> paste<00:02:08.860> is<00:02:09.599> similar<00:02:10.599> to<00:02:10.780> fondant

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
paste gum paste is similar to fondant

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.130 
paste gum paste is similar to fondant
only<00:02:11.950> it<00:02:12.069> dries<00:02:12.340> harder<00:02:12.849> and<00:02:13.150> faster<00:02:13.510> you

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
only it dries harder and faster you

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.080 
only it dries harder and faster you
wouldn't<00:02:14.500> want<00:02:14.650> to<00:02:14.739> cover<00:02:14.980> a<00:02:15.160> cake<00:02:15.489> in<00:02:15.760> gum

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
wouldn't want to cover a cake in gum

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.550 
wouldn't want to cover a cake in gum
paste

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
paste

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.620 
paste
because<00:02:16.770> it<00:02:16.890> would<00:02:17.010> be<00:02:17.160> too<00:02:17.459> hard<00:02:17.730> but<00:02:18.420> what's

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
because it would be too hard but what's

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.479 
because it would be too hard but what's
nice<00:02:18.840> about<00:02:18.870> it<00:02:19.260> is<00:02:19.500> I<00:02:19.709> can<00:02:19.890> just<00:02:19.920> sprinkle

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489

I<00:02:32.520> have<00:02:32.790> here<00:02:35.360> so<00:02:36.360> meet<00:02:36.569> it<00:02:36.720> up<00:02:36.870> first<00:02:37.170> a<00:02:37.319> little

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
I have here so meet it up first a little

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.670 
I have here so meet it up first a little
bit<00:02:37.709> to<00:02:37.950> get<00:02:38.069> the<00:02:38.220> elasticity<00:02:38.700> going<00:02:39.330> and<00:02:40.019> then

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
bit to get the elasticity going and then

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.259 
bit to get the elasticity going and then
just<00:02:40.920> open<00:02:41.280> up<00:02:41.400> your<00:02:41.459> powder<00:02:42.260> like<00:02:43.260> this<00:02:44.269> and

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
just open up your powder like this and

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.089 
just open up your powder like this and
just<00:02:45.780> take<00:02:45.959> some<00:02:46.019> sand<00:02:46.680> just<00:02:46.830> kind<00:02:47.040> of

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099

sprinkle it on there and leave some on
the<00:02:49.319> table<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:49.799> that<00:02:49.920> way<00:02:50.069> I<00:02:50.130> can<00:02:50.370> start

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
the table and that way I can start

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.400 
the table and that way I can start
kneading<00:02:51.090> it<00:02:51.269> and<00:02:51.480> then<00:02:51.630> just<00:02:51.900> kind<00:02:52.110> of<00:02:52.170> knead

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
it all in and that would be plenty for

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.650 
it all in and that would be plenty for
this<00:02:55.739> piece<00:02:55.980> right<00:02:56.190> here<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:56.819> what<00:02:57.330> it<00:02:57.450> does

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
this piece right here and what it does

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.780 
this piece right here and what it does
is<00:02:57.840> he'll<00:02:58.080> actually<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.950> fondant<00:02:59.549> will<00:02:59.640> get

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
is he'll actually the fondant will get

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.170 
is he'll actually the fondant will get
firmer<00:03:00.209> especially<00:03:01.049> if<00:03:01.319> you<00:03:01.530> use<00:03:01.769> this<00:03:02.040> in<00:03:02.430> a

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
firmer especially if you use this in a

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.150 
firmer especially if you use this in a
couple<00:03:03.480> of<00:03:03.569> hours<00:03:04.049> or<00:03:04.430> leave<00:03:05.430> it<00:03:05.930> overnight

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
couple of hours or leave it overnight

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.100 
couple of hours or leave it overnight
it'll<00:03:08.160> get<00:03:08.280> firmer<00:03:08.640> this<00:03:09.420> one<00:03:09.690> I<00:03:09.720> had<00:03:09.959> done

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
it'll get firmer this one I had done

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.640

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.720 
yesterday
and<00:03:10.980> that's<00:03:11.640> that's<00:03:12.120> pretty<00:03:12.330> firm<00:03:13.580> again<00:03:14.580> what

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
and that's that's pretty firm again what

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.780 
and that's that's pretty firm again what
it<00:03:14.849> does<00:03:15.030> is<00:03:15.330> it<00:03:15.510> helps<00:03:16.140> to<00:03:16.560> make<00:03:17.250> your<00:03:17.430> fondant
