just<00:00:16.350> consider<00:00:16.680> Lana<00:00:17.070> looks<00:00:17.190> really<00:00:17.460> good

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
just consider Lana looks really good

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.760 
just consider Lana looks really good
along<00:00:17.760> with<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:17.940> AHL<00:00:18.330> team<00:00:18.359> almost<00:00:19.020> all<00:00:19.289> 70s

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
along with the AHL team almost all 70s

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.620 
along with the AHL team almost all 70s
throughout<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.070> AHL<00:00:20.460> team<00:00:20.490> so<00:00:20.910> both<00:00:21.600> teams

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
throughout the AHL team so both teams

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.779 
throughout the AHL team so both teams
should<00:00:22.050> have<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.199> good<00:00:22.439> season<00:00:23.070> this<00:00:23.340> year<00:00:23.400> and

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
should have a good season this year and

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.820 
should have a good season this year and
obviously<00:00:24.060> AHL<00:00:24.539> team<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.779> think<00:00:24.960> has<00:00:25.410> one<00:00:25.650> like

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
obviously AHL team I think has one like

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.589 
obviously AHL team I think has one like
the<00:00:25.980> last<00:00:26.130> five<00:00:26.490> or<00:00:26.519> six<00:00:26.820> presidents<00:00:27.060> trophies

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
the last five or six presidents trophies

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.599 
the last five or six presidents trophies
in<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.779> AHL<00:00:27.900> so<00:00:28.380> not<00:00:28.890> too<00:00:29.070> worried<00:00:29.250> about<00:00:29.279> them

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
in the AHL so not too worried about them

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:30.830 
in the AHL so not too worried about them
and<00:00:29.730> obviously<00:00:29.820> be<00:00:30.090> still<00:00:30.269> looking<00:00:30.720> for

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
and obviously be still looking for

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.389 
and obviously be still looking for

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
going to the all-star game you can see

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.770 
going to the all-star game you can see
that<00:00:47.129> Patrick<00:00:47.579> Kane<00:00:47.760> made<00:00:48.270> under<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.600> first

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
that Patrick Kane made under the first

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.720 
that Patrick Kane made under the first
line<00:00:48.989> right<00:00:49.170> wing<00:00:49.200> for<00:00:49.530> us<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:50.309> think<00:00:50.340> we

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
line right wing for us and I think we

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.520 
line right wing for us and I think we
might<00:00:51.059> have<00:00:51.210> had<00:00:51.329> defense<00:00:51.719> for<00:00:51.870> making<00:00:52.140> on<00:00:52.230> for

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
but I think we might have a couple high

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.090 
but I think we might have a couple high
70s<00:05:30.270> in<00:05:30.330> top<00:05:30.480> 6<00:05:30.780> i'd<00:05:31.020> much<00:05:31.200> rather<00:05:31.260> have<00:05:31.680> a

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
70s in top 6 i'd much rather have a

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.710 
70s in top 6 i'd much rather have a
couple<00:05:32.580> low<00:05:32.730> 80s<00:05:33.090> as<00:05:33.270> you<00:05:33.390> know<00:05:33.450> i<00:05:33.480> think<00:05:33.510> it's

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
couple low 80s as you know i think it's

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.360 
couple low 80s as you know i think it's
a<00:05:33.780> pretty<00:05:34.140> big<00:05:34.440> jump<00:05:34.680> from<00:05:34.830> high<00:05:35.010> sending<00:05:35.250> two

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
a pretty big jump from high sending two

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:36.860 
a pretty big jump from high sending two
