00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.410
 well back guys it's always yours 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:10.980
 a few scenes that another code speaks to you 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.139
 code is another ibm tease then 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.289
 I want to show that this stamp 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:20.550
 this has not been supported and that is 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:26.180
 bm of sharjah a little what they do and if the 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:28.949
 my eye is not deceiving me 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:32.489
 this stamp was already 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.399
 registered because I see that there is a 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:40.410
 piece of the previous envelope not 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:43.290
 I would be wrong but it has already been removed 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.129
 I think from another envelope was still 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:50.850
 recycled compliments to sharm 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.469
 this too was not stamped then 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:59.239
 consequently it will also be recycled 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:01:01.829
 this now we proceed to the opening 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:07.100
 of ttb and paying attention not to 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.100
 break the stamp to be recycled 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:26.500
 we hope so in order to present 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:29.770
 the stamp ok lost stamp 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:35.830

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:39.190

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.740
