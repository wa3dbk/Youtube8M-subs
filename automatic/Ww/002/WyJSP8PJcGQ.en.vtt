00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
then a USB cable awesome which a USB

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.160 
then a USB cable awesome which a USB
cable<00:00:58.920> in<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.190> bottom<00:00:59.579> which<00:01:00.210> he<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:00.989> actually

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
cable in the bottom which he is actually

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.380 
cable in the bottom which he is actually
quite<00:01:01.590> cool<00:01:02.039> I've<00:01:02.309> seen<00:01:02.550> this<00:01:02.730> demonstrate<00:01:03.270> on

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
quite cool I've seen this demonstrate on

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.660 
quite cool I've seen this demonstrate on
their<00:01:03.539> website<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.290> on<00:01:05.129> one<00:01:05.280> end<00:01:05.309> we<00:01:05.519> have<00:01:05.640> a

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
their website so on one end we have a

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.120 
their website so on one end we have a
standard<00:01:06.000> USB<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:07.130> then<00:01:08.130> we<00:01:08.400> have<00:01:08.610> mini<00:01:10.130> micro

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
standard USB and then we have mini micro

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.480 
standard USB and then we have mini micro
and<00:01:11.520> then<00:01:11.790> 30-pin<00:01:12.450> for<00:01:13.170> iPhone<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.369> way

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
and then 30-pin for iPhone and the way

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.520 
and then 30-pin for iPhone and the way
this<00:01:14.700> works<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:16.049> push<00:01:16.229> them<00:01:16.350> all<00:01:16.409> together

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
this works is to push them all together

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.950 
this works is to push them all together
by<00:01:17.400> phone<00:01:17.700> pull<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.780> first<00:01:18.960> one<00:01:19.229> off<00:01:19.729> micro

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
by phone pull the first one off micro

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.070 
by phone pull the first one off micro
second<00:01:21.960> off<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.500> mini<00:01:22.740> all-in-one<00:01:23.729> cable<00:01:24.180> so

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
second off is mini all-in-one cable so

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.160 
second off is mini all-in-one cable so
it's<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.320> really<00:01:25.830> neat<00:01:26.220> solution<00:01:27.140> the<00:01:28.140> problem

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
it's a really neat solution the problem

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.940 
it's a really neat solution the problem
of<00:01:28.619> carrying<00:01:29.220> multiple<00:01:30.590> instead<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.680> carrying

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
of carrying multiple instead of carrying

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.399 
of carrying multiple instead of carrying
multiple<00:01:32.310> cables<00:01:32.640> carrying<00:01:33.000> one<00:01:33.180> cable<00:01:33.409> which

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
multiple cables carrying one cable which

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.210 
multiple cables carrying one cable which
has<00:01:34.439> all<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.860> connectors<00:01:35.220> in<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.939> also

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
has all the connectors in it and also

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.190 
has all the connectors in it and also
then<00:01:38.220> I'm<00:01:38.340> gonna<00:01:38.430> fall<00:01:38.640> off<00:01:38.840> cause<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:39.930> can't

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
then I'm gonna fall off cause you can't

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.380 
then I'm gonna fall off cause you can't
lose<00:01:40.320> them<00:01:40.530> that's<00:01:41.280> also<00:01:41.729> doubles<00:01:42.119> up<00:01:42.240> with

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
lose them that's also doubles up with

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.120 
lose them that's also doubles up with
laptop<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:45.990> better<00:01:46.530> come<00:01:46.710> up<00:01:46.740> with<00:01:46.829> this<00:01:46.979> in

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
laptop so I better come up with this in

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.109 
laptop so I better come up with this in
a<00:01:47.189> second<00:01:47.659> undies<00:01:48.659> plastic<00:01:49.619> here<00:01:49.970> so<00:01:50.970> it's<00:01:51.060> a

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
a second undies plastic here so it's a

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.100 
a second undies plastic here so it's a
really<00:01:51.390> small<00:01:51.899> lightweight<00:01:53.930> battery<00:01:54.930> cell

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
really small lightweight battery cell

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.310 
really small lightweight battery cell
battery<00:01:55.530> pack<00:01:55.710> there<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.750> we<00:01:57.750> can<00:01:57.899> charge<00:01:58.110> it

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
battery pack there and we can charge it

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.490 
battery pack there and we can charge it
from<00:01:58.560> our<00:01:58.740> PC<00:02:00.170> or<00:02:01.170> Mac<00:02:01.380> or<00:02:02.310> indeed<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:02.729> can<00:02:03.500> use

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
from our PC or Mac or indeed you can use

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.719 
from our PC or Mac or indeed you can use
your<00:02:04.680> iPhone<00:02:05.219> or<00:02:05.790> iPod<00:02:06.119> or<00:02:06.869> iPad<00:02:07.860> charger<00:02:08.250> to

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
your iPhone or iPod or iPad charger to

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.930 
your iPhone or iPod or iPad charger to
charge<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:09.179> with<00:02:09.569> this<00:02:09.690> table

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
charge it with this table

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.240 
charge it with this table
and<00:02:11.120> then<00:02:11.660> you<00:02:12.110> simply<00:02:12.440> remove<00:02:12.560> that<00:02:12.890> cable

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
and then you simply remove that cable

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.880 
and then you simply remove that cable
and<00:02:13.520> turn<00:02:13.820> around<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.090> other<00:02:14.210> way<00:02:14.890> to

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
and turn around the other way to

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.620 
and turn around the other way to
actually<00:02:16.160> supply<00:02:16.550> power<00:02:16.850> to<00:02:17.150> your<00:02:17.390> mobile

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
actually supply power to your mobile

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.400 
actually supply power to your mobile
device<00:02:18.520> pop<00:02:19.520> that<00:02:19.700> other<00:02:19.850> way<00:02:20.060> so<00:02:20.690> that's<00:02:21.140> our

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
device pop that other way so that's our

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.900 
device pop that other way so that's our
input<00:02:21.590> which<00:02:22.550> is<00:02:22.580> a<00:02:22.820> micro<00:02:23.210> USB<00:02:23.480> and<00:02:24.670> output<00:02:25.670> is

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
input which is a micro USB and output is

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.540 
input which is a micro USB and output is
a<00:02:26.270> standard<00:02:27.170> USB<00:02:27.200> so<00:02:27.830> you<00:02:27.860> can<00:02:28.130> use<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.430> cable

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
a standard USB so you can use the cable

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.970 
a standard USB so you can use the cable

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
to that problem of running out of power

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.250 
to that problem of running out of power
when<00:04:50.400> you're<00:04:50.520> on<00:04:50.640> the<00:04:50.760> go<00:04:50.910> as<00:04:51.780> I<00:04:51.900> said<00:04:52.080> this<00:04:52.200> is

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
when you're on the go as I said this is

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.790 
when you're on the go as I said this is
the<00:04:52.650> energy<00:04:52.950> pocket<00:04:53.550> cell<00:04:54.470> they<00:04:55.470> do<00:04:55.530> actually

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
the energy pocket cell they do actually

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.550 
the energy pocket cell they do actually
have<00:04:56.100> the<00:04:56.340> various<00:04:56.700> size<00:04:57.200> probably<00:04:58.200> cells<00:04:58.470> I

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
have the various size probably cells I

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.159 
have the various size probably cells I
do<00:04:58.620> a<00:04:58.710> pocket<00:04:58.890> soldier<00:04:59.370> as<00:04:59.550> well<00:04:59.930> but<00:05:00.930> there<00:05:01.110> we
