00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:07.529
 so hello here is only the first video 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:10.620
 now of the ps3 I thought so 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.150
 we open the ps3 just times and 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.089
 make the fan sitting underneath 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.730
 not from other parties 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:21.000
 We make it clean or no wonder 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:25.400
 after or dusty and now I show 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.710
 what he needs for this once 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.949
 Security key here what 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:37.460
 We got to know about these screws 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.460
 this would be in front 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.399
 I think ahead 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:54.090
 there in there are so secured 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:58.710
 The screws are for the art in 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:04.620
 question and that needs a value here 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:06.750
 your sled box or the main one 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.240
 shut the screwdriver and everyone 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.229
 small screwdriver but me 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.460
 demonstrative care will be so first 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.170
 we already have the security barrier 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:23.509
 explain that the end we take now 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:30.840
 others screw the hall there 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:34.500
 there there his under and there at 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.619
 there is a guarantee for you there 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.970
 Note the bottom screw is there 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.970
 down the screw for the hard drive 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.289
 screwed is the hard drive but that 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.420
 You do not have to rob you of nonsense 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.110
 make lots are next to videos 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.900
 idiocy 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:59.210
 that's why I do not do that now and 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.210
 supply atomic can provides 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:07.090
 and here is 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:57.620
 just two digits away everything 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:57.620
 he does not enjoy it 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.349
 we must 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.920
 none of us welcome 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.370
 and do not forget that with the 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:23.270
 I guarantee I was already there 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.270
 first does not have to open 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:49.790

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.790
 fan for me and the 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.900
 and so 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:29.090
 The dust gets a vacuum cleaner 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:32.200
 once declared does not have to go down 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.200
 to do with a frame 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.800
