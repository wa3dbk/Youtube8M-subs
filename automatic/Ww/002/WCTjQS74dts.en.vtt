00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 women are forgotten of course 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.790
 but before I start I want to give the 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.649
 welcome our audience and 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.649
 offer them a wave from here 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:17.820
 after 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:20.099
 and the one that has the big thing that good and the 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.200
 have a good boy a lot of eye because 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:23.610
 As a welcome creator, you are going to 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.950
 practice precisely how we can 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.330
 enlarge the eye with a big eye like 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.329
 make up rather how are we going to 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.980
 make up a big eye ok ok me 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:33.510
 I made a mistake that's good because the truth 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.920
 we have remained the big eye to have 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.329
 how big we think we can hang him 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.329
 until the molcajete then you have to 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.800
 see me I've hit on that so much 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.690
 careful all our viewers and 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.310
 all our beloved public a kiss 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.530
 big a very new thanks your 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.530
 Honey and his follow-up to the bull 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.170
 notice that yes it is true people 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.540
 who have the big eye 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.239
 they usually make up that eye and what 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.370
 line out we're going to make a 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.590
 delineated only inside so that 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.440
 see that what we are going to do is give 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.390
 an intention to that look without need 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.369
 to make it even bigger because the 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.420
 truth is not necessary if you 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.790
 you identify with our model 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.190
 Colombian percent and Karim to Ghana 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.810
 I love it because finally if we can 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.700
 do in it both a delineated by 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.020
 outside like a delineated inside the 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.180
 suggestion is the next let's 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:26.050
 use our pasta eyeliner 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.870
 I look up and let's go look 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.850
 well we can use this this 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.430
 eyeliner that you can be a pencil 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.410
 I also recommend these pasta 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:39.400
 definitely because they are going to be fixed 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.870
 much better to the eye ok now also like 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.940
 that will have more time with them I have 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.000
 that feeling and notice something very 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.640
 important that we can also delineate 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.050
 the top part but why is it 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.960
 on the inside think very well what I 'm going to 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.090
 do look under coat already lift or if 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.310
 follow lines inside is not done 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.630
 boy the eye not in the case of the 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.100
 people with big eyes 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.470
 I'm not delineating the half towards 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:07.180
 outside all I want is to give the 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:09.369
 intention of an eye above an eye 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.690
 big intense what I do not want is to do 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.820
 a bigger big eye 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.800
 once that is what is the intention of 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.220
 do this outlined and in the lower part 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.970
 we are also going to use another one 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:25.070
 brush and I will use a brown shadow 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:28.280
 medium dark above and only in this 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.410
 part of here we are going to handle the shadow 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.330
 then sexy would be advisable too 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.930
 start doing makeup from the origin 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.280
 of the eye, so yes, precisely 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.200
 because what we are doing is 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.820
 emphasize the eye but make a 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.980
 we delineated from the middle out what 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.720
 we make even bigger that we're going to 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.000
 do when we have an average eye a 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.700
 small eye in the case of our model 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.170
 viviana so we're going to put it to the 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.850
 tear but look carefully what I 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.360
 I'm delineating on the outside is only 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.640
 with shadow of the dough eyeliner or 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.370
 we will use it inside the eye 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.720
 and we are going to use it in the lower part and 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.040
 on top 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.350
 then remember that you are going to 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.540
 lift the eyelid from going down the double 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.180
 high and this is where we are going to enter 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.780
 look well in the middle out 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.730
 to give that intention to the eye ok the 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.549
 today's goal you can open it 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.590
 It is precisely that you observe that 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:24.049
 if you're going to give the invention to an eye 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.510
 big is going to look nice that if you go to 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.760
 Guess on the outside you're going to make an eye 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.400
 very large where somehow the 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.579
 intention that you have one of you have 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.889
 a natural depth can be lost 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:38.389
 ok we can not attend to them, done there 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:40.459
 two eyes one that is not delineated and the 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:42.590
 another yes to remain the intention that 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.750
 has the delineation inside 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.180
 good as channel the colors with which 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.909
 one is outlined is the most obscure 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.409
 what would be the best way 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:53.239
 we started to apply first what is 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:55.010
 the shadows with the brushes and until the 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.560
 last in pencil eyeliner inside 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.780
 here it does not matter in what way soon 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.609
 we started with shadows definitely at 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.019
 final let's outline remember that 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:04.639
 always delineated that we're going to 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:06.829
 use with pasta we are going to fix it with 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:09.739
 dust ok then good what's important 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:11.900
 here for you is that you can fix it 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.549
 but inside they can 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.840
 use as many a pencil or as the one 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:17.120
 I just showed you that it sticks 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.040
 because it is fixed much more 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.049
 will give us as a better intention 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.030
 for this delineated then no 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.160
 let's bring and you have your big eye no 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.870
 let's fall into the excess by telling it to give 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.030
 that little detail that little 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.090
 intention for your eye to look very 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.250
 cute look striking but not a 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.320
 degree as you said to charge him until the 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.660
 pelvic I'll ask about the 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.090
 color because then we also say I say 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.650
 as all times it is an error that I have 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.110
 purple I come from green I come from nose 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.930
 and put hard does not live this color 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:50.090
 in dark coffee is ideal for a 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.650
 delineated if you are going to go at night 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.110
 of course although the girls are leaving 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.880
 elongated you can use a black but 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.039
 on the black use a brown shadow 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.289
 that is very important to remember those 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:02.180
 delineated out of the eye are not 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:04.100
 still I am going to forgive I want 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.740
 ask anyone the aiea and this 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.750
 question that is neither pencil nor this 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.570
 question in cream that are like powder that 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.820
 clean the eye is valid to wear it eye 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.860
 big or small or medium jr because 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.139
 you know the same if yes if nothing but eye 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.940
 when we have a small eye then 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:20.689
 we will always use the outline 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.519
 outside 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:24.949
 because these powders always use 

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:26.809
 inside then we are going to handle that 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:28.669
 intention if your eye is small we go 

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:30.679
 let's delineate the outside the case 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:33.619
 of today that is a big eye 

00:05:30.679 --> 00:05:35.869
 let's delineate the inside if your eye 

00:05:33.619 --> 00:05:38.029
 it's very very big, we're definitely going 

00:05:35.869 --> 00:05:40.219
 to leave nothing else the delineated inside 

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:42.889
 without using the shadow on the outside and what 

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:45.829
 happens and what happens if we do not delineate it and 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:47.719
 it only gets its end nothing happens 

00:05:45.829 --> 00:05:49.159
 not passive here is really the goal 

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:50.929
 where are we going to do in the 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:52.909
 day I'm in offices and I go to parties and 

00:05:50.929 --> 00:05:54.949
 I go to a cafe where I will be if it goes to 

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:59.809
 have little light a lot of light from that 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:06:01.789
 depends how I'm going to still have another 

00:05:59.809 --> 00:06:03.529
 doubt because I'm watching a magazine 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:05.599
 fashion and it's getting back to using the 

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:08.389
 trend of the 60s is from the line 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:10.339
 very black black very defined in the part 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:12.489
 upper part of the eyelid suits us 

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:14.659
 of the large fennel 

00:06:12.489 --> 00:06:16.159
 definitely do not remember that 

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:17.029
 let's fall into the excess because 

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:20.239
 so if it's going to look like 

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:23.409
 characterized then if it is if it is 2 

00:06:20.239 --> 00:06:23.409
 November I think so 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:29.650
 the fruits have the tendency is and 

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:31.990
 comes with this delineated but eye let's go 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.180
 to go see that fashion what is not 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.190
 comfortably remember very well let's 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.540
 take care of that little detail and good if you 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.920
 today you have a big eye and you go to 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.690
 delineate is not going to be a good party 

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.370
 Follow this little advice and good me 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.900
 I think that you will do very well in that 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.060
 party in that club or in that meeting that 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:48.620
 have the we will finish us fix 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:52.730
 because we've forgotten energy 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:55.200
 with all these programs 

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:57.840
 reference again take homework 

00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:00.000
 they take out banking tasks to delineate 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.490
 do not play it every day more beautiful 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.220
 pretty little girls as they are shown 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:07.760
 the women and víctor let's continue with 

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.760
 the other flakes
