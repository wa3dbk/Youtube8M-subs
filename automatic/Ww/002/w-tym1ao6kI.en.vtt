00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299
 and 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.610
 At this moment, the 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.369
 sag and the advance of the wheels is made 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.770
 by a machine obviously with a 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:21.590
 laser and two operators who are in a 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.590
 pit they are making the last adjustments 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.320
 5 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.920
 yes 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.440
 do not 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:34.130
 when he dies 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.130
 nothing 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.469
 i 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.850
 the night 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:50.380
 in this sector they test everything about 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:54.340
 to the alignment of the car simulates in a 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.289
 normal driving situation on the street 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.920
 and all that the idea is that all 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:01.810
 deficient can notice in his first 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.060
 first shot do not notice first here in 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.679
 the factory thing that the customer when he 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.990
 sit in your car and take it out of the 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:10.679
 factory goes perfectly there is no need 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.679
 make any adjustments 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:23.570
 and nothing more 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.570
 Y 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.230
 Y 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.909
 Y 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.690
 perfect good obviously what we are 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:06.420
 seeing in this sector is the test 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.790
 tightness has a father in his hand 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.129
 where each of the models is shown 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.019
 to do a thorough follow-up on 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.879
 the center of the car that requires a 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.870
 flashlight and it's illuminating the two 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.879
 sectors to see that water does not enter 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.580
 to see some frustration has to 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:25.489
 mark which side where you go forward or 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.409
 back the seriousness of the problem to be 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.140
 solved in the case we tested 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:32.030
 we did not have any problem is 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.340
 perfect in a convertible car so 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.079
 well marked all 6 and it's happening the 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.769

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:38.769
