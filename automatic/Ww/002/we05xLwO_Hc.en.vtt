00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:02.899 
all right here we are looking at the

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:09.259 
all right here we are looking at the
third<00:00:03.899> floor<00:00:03.929> of<00:00:05.480> a<00:00:07.309> townhome<00:00:08.309> complex<00:00:08.639> this

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
third floor of a townhome complex this

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.299 
third floor of a townhome complex this
wall<00:00:09.540> here<00:00:09.929> is<00:00:10.139> a<00:00:10.170> common<00:00:10.590> wall<00:00:10.769> shared<00:00:11.190> with

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
wall here is a common wall shared with

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.310 
wall here is a common wall shared with
another<00:00:11.340> unit<00:00:11.940> as<00:00:12.120> well<00:00:12.389> as<00:00:12.540> this<00:00:12.719> one<00:00:12.929> so<00:00:13.170> this

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
another unit as well as this one so this

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.880 
another unit as well as this one so this
upper<00:00:13.860> floor<00:00:14.219> has<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.549> very<00:00:14.849> low<00:00:15.210> load<00:00:15.990> you<00:00:16.830> can

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
upper floor has a very low load you can

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.820 
upper floor has a very low load you can
see<00:00:17.220> here<00:00:17.550> that<00:00:17.779> right<00:00:18.779> self<00:00:19.109> tells<00:00:19.439> us<00:00:19.619> we

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
see here that right self tells us we

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.269 
see here that right self tells us we
only<00:00:19.980> need<00:00:20.250> 300<00:00:20.820> CFM<00:00:21.710> throughout<00:00:22.710> this<00:00:22.890> floor

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
only need 300 CFM throughout this floor

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.670 
only need 300 CFM throughout this floor
to<00:00:23.550> maintain<00:00:24.060> n<00:00:24.390> door<00:00:24.869> design<00:00:25.170> commissions

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
to maintain n door design commissions

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.529 
to maintain n door design commissions
this<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:27.349> return<00:00:28.349> here<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.730> has<00:00:29.880> 300<00:00:30.359> CFM

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
this is a return here that has 300 CFM

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.110 
this is a return here that has 300 CFM
so<00:00:31.050> we<00:00:31.140> see<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.410> supplies<00:00:31.800> in<00:00:32.099> each<00:00:32.219> room<00:00:32.460> that

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
so we see the supplies in each room that

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.580 
so we see the supplies in each room that
tells<00:00:33.360> us<00:00:33.510> how<00:00:33.660> much<00:00:33.840> air<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:34.320> needed<00:00:35.360> so

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
tells us how much air is needed so

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.330 
tells us how much air is needed so
obviously<00:00:37.590> you're<00:00:37.739> going<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.980> have<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.129> rough

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
obviously you're going to have a rough

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.869 
obviously you're going to have a rough
time<00:00:38.399> finding<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.149> 300<00:00:39.719> CFM<00:00:40.730> piece<00:00:41.730> of

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
time finding a 300 CFM piece of

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.180 
time finding a 300 CFM piece of
machinery<00:00:42.180> for<00:00:42.899> this<00:00:43.050> upper<00:00:43.410> level<00:00:43.710> so<00:00:44.010> we're

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
machinery for this upper level so we're

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.010 
machinery for this upper level so we're
going<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.399> assume<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:45.120> time<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.840> half

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
going to assume that a time the half

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.319 
going to assume that a time the half
split<00:00:46.410> unit<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:46.800> going<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.100> be<00:00:47.219> used<00:00:47.489> so<00:00:48.180> in

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
split unit is going to be used so in

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.920 
split unit is going to be used so in
order<00:00:48.450> for<00:00:48.570> us<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.890> modify<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.100> CFM

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
order for us to modify the CFM

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.569 
order for us to modify the CFM
requirements<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.680> spit<00:00:53.160> out<00:00:53.250> in<00:00:53.460> this

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
requirements that spit out in this

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.400

go in here and type in 600 so that we

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.270 
go in here and type in 600 so that we
will<00:01:31.710> now<00:01:32.549> be<00:01:32.790> using<00:01:33.210> 600<00:01:33.900> CFM<00:01:34.140> throughout<00:01:35.009> and

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
will now be using 600 CFM throughout and

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.640 
will now be using 600 CFM throughout and
notice<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:35.670> it's<00:01:35.820> all<00:01:35.970> updated<00:01:36.259> it's<00:01:37.259> taken

notice that it's all updated it's taken
that<00:01:37.770> extra<00:01:38.189> 300<00:01:38.729> CFM<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.570> split<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:39.930> out

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
that extra 300 CFM and split it out

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.700 
that extra 300 CFM and split it out
amongst<00:01:42.210> all<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.509> different<00:01:42.810> rooms<00:01:43.079> here<00:01:43.470> so
