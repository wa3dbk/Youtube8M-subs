 Actually in the sleep look and wanted 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.199
 now I almost go on room 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.720
 because Samsung has below to again 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.460
 a private audience so to speak for the 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.170
 German tech blogger journalists 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.960
 community loaded and at the 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.840
 Occasion are us samsung galaxy s 4 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.160

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.390

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.710
 So, in a row, show what now 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.850
 everything is lying around here this is new 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.780
 Samsung introduced this galaxy nx 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.890
 system camera you have the mirrorless 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.879
 already detailed man 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.370
 organize here again with a 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.210
 wear really thick lens 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.390
 maybe we can show again 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.910
 So you can lose weight here and so 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.090
 changes fine thing so then we have 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.940
 here is a samsung galaxy s four mini das 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:58.289
 I already showed 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:02.550
 small compact and then we have here 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.500
 the samsung galaxy s 4g is not 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.030
 but maybe I am also on 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.180
 wrong place no matter he knows already 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.040
 here is a samsung galaxy s 4 active that 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.960
 This author version is the waterproof one 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.700
 is and now maybe you can 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.430
 once in peace down then look because he 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.509
 just now there was such a 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.799
 security service point if I can 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.790
 but at the opportunity also grad 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.020
 make number off here 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.020
 then you see that fact again 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.240
 nice as here almost the battery and the 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.150
 maps are indeed changeable but just 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.340
 through such a bay in the here so 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.830
 a rubber lip purely comes in 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:41.480
 be protected from water fine thing 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:44.000
 for water sportsmen and divers and 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.920
 similar and now that's it 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.540
 classic samsung galaxy s 4 in i 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.850
 believe mabel light is called the 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.380
 shade and here are just two new ones 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.550
 we did not know that yet so we have 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.320
 ever seen flies but now too 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.520
 live that is I really know how 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.930
 It does not mean just think 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.500
 I just call this what I call this 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.570
 samsung galaxy s 4 in europe red or 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.369
 place in the red maybe again such a 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.880
 a little bit like that 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:12.840
 fall leaves so a wine red version 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:14.200
 Here you see that is here below 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.720
 therefore 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.060
 is that too and responsive here and there 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.260
 we still have such a blue version 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.439
 I'll just call that one now 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.030
 the summer sky blue we write that 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:27.049
 Of course, the article is still pure like that 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.470
 colors are really hot then i know 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:32.959
 really not now and that is one 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.459
 yes the blue is blue so different 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.110
 as for example that there are three in 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.650
 pebble blue not at all that that was 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.299
 at the s3 he indicated such a blue 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.239
 is already quite strong 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:46.010
 blue but frankly does not look 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.930
 so bad, but also just a dummy 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.599
 and you can see from the beginning 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.129
 So they are blue and also in front 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:54.709
 framed in red 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:56.299
 One had on the primary event but 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.829
 yet repeatedly shown few years the 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.709
 there are not here yet 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:02.540
 were also clear let's say 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.329
 luminosity the colors for example 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.220
 pink was also there so that it 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.290
 four will definitely come in the course of 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.690
 next month also in 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.530
 quite a lot of chic colors so you can tell 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.000
 I'm already starting here 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.170
 stutter and a bit to suffer that 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.209
 it is because it is already very much 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.530
 is very late and we are very long up 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.430
 this premiere next to about because wants 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.220
