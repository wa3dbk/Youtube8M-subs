00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.240 
of methods be careful and you move
towards<00:01:50.110> the<00:01:50.229> center<00:01:50.409> you'll<00:01:50.650> notice<00:01:51.010> where

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
towards the center you'll notice where

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.740 
towards the center you'll notice where
see<00:01:51.790> where<00:01:51.909> that<00:01:52.030> just<00:01:52.150> went<00:01:52.360> off<00:01:52.510> and<00:01:52.659> it

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
see where that just went off and it

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.539 
see where that just went off and it
killed<00:01:52.930> Dom<00:01:53.170> it<00:01:53.590> didn't<00:01:53.979> hurt<00:01:54.070> me<00:01:54.250> because<00:01:54.430> I

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
killed Dom it didn't hurt me because I

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.219 
killed Dom it didn't hurt me because I
had<00:01:54.790> the<00:01:54.939> the<00:01:55.180> concrete<00:01:55.540> pillar<00:01:55.750> in<00:01:55.900> front<00:01:56.110> of

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
had the the concrete pillar in front of

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:57.600 
had the the concrete pillar in front of
me<00:01:56.320> but<00:01:56.439> if<00:01:56.530> I<00:01:56.619> would<00:01:56.740> have<00:01:56.860> been<00:01:57.070> either<00:01:57.280> side

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
me but if I would have been either side

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.730 
me but if I would have been either side
of<00:01:57.640> it<00:01:57.939> it<00:01:58.210> probably<00:01:58.600> killed<00:01:58.990> me<00:01:59.140> as<00:01:59.290> well

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
of it it probably killed me as well

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.550 
of it it probably killed me as well
it<00:02:00.460> has<00:02:00.729> ridiculous<00:02:01.450> range<00:02:01.689> I<00:02:01.869> can't<00:02:02.080> even<00:02:02.229> get

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
it has ridiculous range I can't even get

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.990 
it has ridiculous range I can't even get
across<00:02:02.890> to<00:02:03.130> you<00:02:03.159> if<00:02:03.340> you've<00:02:03.460> not<00:02:03.640> played<00:02:03.790> this

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
across to you if you've not played this

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.020 
across to you if you've not played this
part<00:02:04.270> how<00:02:04.450> stupid<00:02:05.049> this<00:02:05.200> is<00:02:05.409> and<00:02:05.740> I<00:02:06.580> actually

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
part how stupid this is and I actually

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.669 
part how stupid this is and I actually
tried<00:02:07.450> the<00:02:07.630> middle<00:02:07.869> area<00:02:08.170> with<00:02:08.289> the<00:02:08.379> pillars

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
tried the middle area with the pillars

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.050 
tried the middle area with the pillars
just<00:02:08.860> going<00:02:09.039> pillar<00:02:09.280> to<00:02:09.459> pillar<00:02:09.700> as<00:02:09.819> it<00:02:09.939> was

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
just going pillar to pillar as it was

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.509 
just going pillar to pillar as it was
going<00:02:10.209> around<00:02:10.769> there's<00:02:11.769> a<00:02:11.920> strategy<00:02:12.129> and<00:02:12.459> it

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
going around there's a strategy and it

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:14.339 
going around there's a strategy and it
worked<00:02:12.700> really<00:02:12.939> well<00:02:13.030> but<00:02:13.720> then<00:02:13.840> just<00:02:14.170> before

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
worked really well but then just before

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.440 
worked really well but then just before
it<00:02:14.680> was<00:02:14.769> landing<00:02:15.189> or<00:02:15.340> peak<00:02:15.519> fired<00:02:15.760> one<00:02:16.030> barrage

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
it was landing or peak fired one barrage

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.360 
it was landing or peak fired one barrage
and<00:02:16.780> just<00:02:16.900> killed<00:02:17.110> me<00:02:17.230> instantly<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:17.830> I

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
and just killed me instantly and I

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.430 
and just killed me instantly and I
wasted<00:02:18.760> four<00:02:18.939> minutes<00:02:19.769> so<00:02:20.769> this<00:02:21.639> is

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
wasted four minutes so this is

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.880 
wasted four minutes so this is
ah<00:02:23.240> it's<00:02:24.240> like<00:02:24.300> right<00:02:24.570> now<00:02:24.750> I'm<00:02:24.990> I'm<00:02:25.530> scared

ah it's like right now I'm I'm scared

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.620 
ah it's like right now I'm I'm scared
for<00:02:26.040> myself<00:02:26.160> because<00:02:26.640> I<00:02:26.670> know<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:27.390> thing

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
for myself because I know that thing

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.650 
for myself because I know that thing
could<00:02:27.780> kill<00:02:27.960> me<00:02:28.110> now<00:02:28.260> because<00:02:28.890> I'm<00:02:29.330> you<00:02:30.330> can't

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
could kill me now because I'm you can't

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.850 
could kill me now because I'm you can't
get<00:02:30.840> in<00:02:30.960> a<00:02:31.050> good<00:02:31.200> piece<00:02:31.380> of<00:02:31.410> cover<00:02:31.680> that

doesn't seem to be a way to do this a
perfect<00:02:34.530> way<00:02:34.920> aside<00:02:35.310> from<00:02:35.520> hoping<00:02:36.210> it<00:02:36.330> doesn't

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
perfect way aside from hoping it doesn't

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.230 
perfect way aside from hoping it doesn't
fire<00:02:36.900> anywhere<00:02:37.290> near<00:02:37.500> you<00:02:37.740> it's<00:02:38.550> just<00:02:38.880> it's

trying to do it cuz it just got to the
point<00:04:56.400> where<00:04:56.640> it<00:04:56.700> was<00:04:56.820> fucking<00:04:57.150> ridiculous

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
point where it was fucking ridiculous

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.810

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
finish line you don't want to do it and

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.500 
finish line you don't want to do it and
that<00:05:10.500> guy<00:05:10.650> there<00:05:10.890> has<00:05:11.340> a<00:05:11.370> turret<00:05:11.850> the<00:05:12.180> best<00:05:12.390> way

that guy there has a turret the best way
to<00:05:12.540> hit<00:05:12.780> him<00:05:12.990> is<00:05:13.110> if<00:05:13.230> you<00:05:13.320> maneuver<00:05:13.860> Marcus<00:05:14.280> to

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
to hit him is if you maneuver Marcus to

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.070 
to hit him is if you maneuver Marcus to
the<00:05:14.700> left<00:05:14.910> I<00:05:15.240> mean<00:05:15.480> look<00:05:15.630> at<00:05:15.690> that<00:05:15.810> that<00:05:15.930> will

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
the left I mean look at that that will

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
I maneuvered him a little bit and he

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.950 
I maneuvered him a little bit and he
porks<00:05:20.760> he<00:05:20.880> sholde<00:05:21.150> around<00:05:21.450> and<00:05:21.630> he's<00:05:21.720> there

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960
