00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 and hello friends are all welcome to 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.290
 that we 're going with a mega tutorial in the 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:11.099
 which is going to see how to change the subject to 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:15.000
 our ai device good we have 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.830
 our devices as well as in their 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.230
 moment is running in the failure of 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.359
 7 and we see on YouTube that people change 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.150
 the topics all the time that I 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.060
 I mean to change the subject in which 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:31.050
 applications change in many ways 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.360
 Sometimes the application is circular and good 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.390
 many other conditions that requires 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.390
 according to the theme that we download and good 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.420
 to do this we will need two things 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.559
 obviously the jailbreak with cydia and 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.879
 second good winterboard let's go 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.879
 quickly so day 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.280
 and in cydia let's go find 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.760
 in search we will wait for our 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:04.010
 syria load and in search we will go in the 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.010
 top to write winter vogue 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:19.190
 ready we will appear like this winter bolt 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.500
 and we will give you here on the top 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.820
 right in installing to me I get it 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.460
 modify because I already have it 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:29.210
 installed and ready once we have it 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.930
 installed will appear to us from the following 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.730
 way is the icon of winter boat and blue 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.910
 well now what we need is 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.440
 download a theme this theme is one of 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.470
 the best I 've seen in these 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.770
 moments for it from 7 and it makes me 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.540
 perfect to boot in this example 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.720
 let's go in the search part no 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:55.420
 we will need to add no repo and 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:59.280
 we will write there they look 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:03.670
 with your pro as it appears on the screen 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.490
 let's give it to the tweet and we'll give it in the 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.170
 part here superior in installing me 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.110
 come out modify because I already have it 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:16.090
 installed ok once we have it 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:19.660
 installed we will go to winter board 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:23.500
 and we will be attentive that the summer bold 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.890
 moat is activated we will not go to 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.230
 select theme 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.500
 and in the bottom almost always 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.250
 It appears the last issue we downloaded 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:38.410
 to click what 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.410
 until these pimps appear 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:46.460
 We will clean everything you say to and with prof 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.370
 there they look with pro 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:52.490
 and this part of here we will not move it 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.490
 we will leave this way still this is to give 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.650
 priority to the topic we want once 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.100
 we have done this we will give you in re 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.100
 sprint 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.170
 wait a few seconds 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.720
 to make our device do the rest 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:17.150
 ok once once made the jump 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.849
 we will unlock our ai device 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.629
 and we'll see that applications have 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:27.019
 changed if you can see the top 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:31.159
 no signal from the cell phone is with another 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:34.430
 reason the wifi appears a nugget at 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:37.040
 just like when I load and many other 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:40.849
 things we will see in this spectacular tweet 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.859
 the rebel that seems spectacular to me and 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:46.459
 good if they want their face time to be 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:49.879
 so huÃ¡sabas reds and white or that change 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.409
 so your device or how to unlock my 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:54.829
 device in the description 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:57.230
 you will find videos like that and many more 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:04:00.049

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.329
 winter bowl but you liked it 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:04.639
