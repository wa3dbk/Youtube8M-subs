00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
hi welcome to another tutorial and this

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.220 
hi welcome to another tutorial and this
one's<00:00:02.790> just<00:00:02.850> a<00:00:03.000> quick<00:00:03.300> little<00:00:03.510> guide<00:00:03.780> on<00:00:03.810> how

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
one's just a quick little guide on how

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.740 
one's just a quick little guide on how
to<00:00:04.290> unlock<00:00:04.980> the<00:00:05.160> unofficial<00:00:05.609> overclocking<00:00:06.600> in

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
to unlock the unofficial overclocking in

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.290 
to unlock the unofficial overclocking in
msi<00:00:07.290> afterburner<00:00:07.580> our<00:00:08.580> reason<00:00:08.910> you'd<00:00:09.030> want<00:00:09.090> to

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
msi afterburner our reason you'd want to

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.509 
msi afterburner our reason you'd want to
do<00:00:09.480> this<00:00:09.660> is<00:00:09.929> because<00:00:10.380> it<00:00:10.679> increases<00:00:11.370> the

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
do this is because it increases the

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.049 
do this is because it increases the
overclocking<00:00:12.330> limit<00:00:12.630> for<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.290> GPU<00:00:13.679> core<00:00:14.160> you

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
overclocking limit for the GPU core you

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.109 
overclocking limit for the GPU core you
can<00:00:15.150> see<00:00:15.360> our<00:00:15.690> we're<00:00:16.379> using<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.800> 7850<00:00:17.670> that<00:00:18.000> has

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
can see our we're using a 7850 that has

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.099 
can see our we're using a 7850 that has
a<00:00:18.260> 860<00:00:19.260> megahertz<00:00:19.710> GPU<00:00:20.130> clock<00:00:20.340> speed<00:00:21.109> by

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
a 860 megahertz GPU clock speed by

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.750 
a 860 megahertz GPU clock speed by
default<00:00:22.560> we<00:00:22.740> can<00:00:22.769> only<00:00:23.070> increase<00:00:23.430> that<00:00:23.699> to

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
default we can only increase that to

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.040 
default we can only increase that to
1,000<00:00:24.689> megahertz<00:00:25.699> this<00:00:26.699> card<00:00:27.090> we<00:00:27.390> know<00:00:27.630> can<00:00:27.930> go

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
1,000 megahertz this card we know can go

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.540 
1,000 megahertz this card we know can go
higher<00:00:28.289> than<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:28.590> in<00:00:28.800> fact<00:00:28.830> they<00:00:29.250> can<00:00:29.279> hit

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
higher than that in fact they can hit

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.549 
higher than that in fact they can hit
about<00:00:30.109> 1100<00:00:31.109> megahertz<00:00:31.940> but<00:00:32.940> using<00:00:33.780> MSI<00:00:34.110> and

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
about 1100 megahertz but using MSI and

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.650 
about 1100 megahertz but using MSI and
all<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.950> other<00:00:35.149> overclocking<00:00:36.149> tools<00:00:36.390> out

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
all the other overclocking tools out

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.840 
all the other overclocking tools out
there<00:00:36.690> won't<00:00:37.469> let<00:00:37.739> us<00:00:37.890> go<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.340> high<00:00:38.579> without

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
there won't let us go that high without

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.450 
there won't let us go that high without
doing<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.480> little<00:00:39.690> tweaking<00:00:40.170> so<00:00:41.100> what<00:00:41.309> we're

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
doing a little tweaking so what we're

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.000 
doing a little tweaking so what we're
going<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.610> do<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.910> change<00:00:42.180> this<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.840> go<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.739> our

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
going to do to change this is go to our

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.000 
going to do to change this is go to our
program<00:00:44.700> files<00:00:45.030> in<00:00:45.570> msi<00:00:46.110> afterburner<00:00:46.320> we

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
program files in msi afterburner we

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.529 
program files in msi afterburner we
already<00:00:47.219> have<00:00:47.340> this<00:00:47.460> open<00:00:47.789> for<00:00:47.969> convenience

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
already have this open for convenience

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.439 
already have this open for convenience
but<00:00:49.500> once<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.399> have<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.730> open<00:00:50.789> here's<00:00:51.270> what

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
but once you have that open here's what

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.299 
but once you have that open here's what
you<00:00:51.570> do<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:51.930> want<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.140> right-click<00:00:52.440> on<00:00:53.010> the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
you do you want to right-click on the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.750 
you do you want to right-click on the
MSI<00:00:53.789> Afterburner<00:00:54.289> CFG<00:00:55.289> file<00:00:55.579> you're<00:00:56.579> going<00:00:56.610> to

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
MSI Afterburner CFG file you're going to

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.189 
MSI Afterburner CFG file you're going to
go<00:00:56.850> into<00:00:57.030> properties<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.899> from<00:00:58.050> their

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
go into properties and from their

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.099 
go into properties and from their
security<00:00:58.710> tab<00:00:59.809> essentially<00:01:00.809> what<00:01:00.960> we're

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
security tab essentially what we're

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.349 
security tab essentially what we're
doing<00:01:01.140> here<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.800> going<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.430> our<00:01:02.579> username<00:01:03.090> and

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
doing here is going to our username and

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.850 
doing here is going to our username and
making<00:01:03.690> sure<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:03.989> we<00:01:04.110> have<00:01:04.199> full<00:01:04.470> control

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
making sure that we have full control

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.460 
making sure that we have full control
that<00:01:05.159> file<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:05.760> we<00:01:05.880> can<00:01:05.909> modify<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.630> just<00:01:07.049> hit

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
that file so we can modify it just hit

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.149 
that file so we can modify it just hit
apply<00:01:07.560> ok<00:01:08.549> ok<00:01:09.119> again<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.960> then<00:01:10.830> you're<00:01:11.010> going

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
apply ok ok again and then you're going

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.350 
apply ok ok again and then you're going
to<00:01:11.250> want<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.670> go<00:01:11.820> into<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.360> file<00:01:12.540> itself<00:01:14.360> we

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
to want to go into the file itself we

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.719 
to want to go into the file itself we
find<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.900> notepad<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.890> easiest<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.610> do

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
find that notepad is the easiest to do

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.740 
find that notepad is the easiest to do
this<00:01:17.880> in<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.360> just<00:01:18.509> puts<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.869> in<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:18.990> nice<00:01:19.200> layout

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
this in it just puts it in a nice layout

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.370 
this in it just puts it in a nice layout
alright<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:21.930> you're<00:01:22.020> going<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.170> want<00:01:22.320> to

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
alright so you're going to want to

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.780 
alright so you're going to want to
scroll<00:01:22.650> all<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.860> way<00:01:22.979> down<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.430> bottom

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
scroll all the way down to the bottom

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.580 
scroll all the way down to the bottom
and<00:01:23.939> down<00:01:24.150> here<00:01:24.330> we<00:01:24.509> have<00:01:24.780> unofficial

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
overclocking mode is in 0 so you want to

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.069 
overclocking mode is in 0 so you want to
take<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.229> zero<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.799> turn<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.070> into<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.340> 1<00:01:38.640> and

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
take that zero and turn it into a 1 and

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:43.999 
take that zero and turn it into a 1 and

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
then in the EUL a section you have to do

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.950 
then in the EUL a section you have to do
this<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.549> essentially<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.149> just<00:01:45.390> says<00:01:45.720> two

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
this and essentially it just says two

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.679 
this and essentially it just says two
msi<00:01:46.470> we<00:01:47.250> understand<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.299> we're<00:01:48.479> going

fully understand the MSI will not
provide<00:01:58.170> me<00:01:58.380> support<00:01:58.860> on<00:01:59.009> it

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
provide me support on it

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.100 
provide me support on it
so<00:02:00.060> essentially<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.509> just<00:02:00.570> know<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:01.079> know

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
so essentially you just know you know

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.569 
so essentially you just know you know
you're<00:02:01.439> going<00:02:01.680> beyond<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.009> limits<00:02:02.340> and

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
you're going beyond the limits and

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:03.740 
you're going beyond the limits and
that's<00:02:03.090> fine

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
that's fine

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.260 
that's fine
so<00:02:04.200> now<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.380> want<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.680> save<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:06.409> close<00:02:07.409> and

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
so now you want to save it close and

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.490 
so now you want to save it close and
close<00:02:09.270> msi<00:02:09.810> afterburner

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.630 

from<00:02:13.500> there<00:02:13.740> you're<00:02:14.130> going<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.280> want<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.550> open

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
from there you're going to want to open

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.870 
from there you're going to want to open
MSI<00:02:15.270> Afterburner<00:02:15.390> again<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.400> now<00:02:17.400> you<00:02:17.460> can

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
MSI Afterburner again and now you can

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.400 
MSI Afterburner again and now you can
see<00:02:18.620> we<00:02:19.620> can<00:02:19.770> hit<00:02:19.920> 1000<00:02:20.750> 120<00:02:21.750> megahertz<00:02:22.050> on<00:02:22.320> the

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
see we can hit 1000 120 megahertz on the

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.250 
see we can hit 1000 120 megahertz on the
GPU<00:02:22.800> clock<00:02:23.070> so<00:02:23.610> that<00:02:23.730> puts<00:02:23.970> us<00:02:24.150> just<00:02:24.600> over<00:02:24.840> what

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
GPU clock so that puts us just over what

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.950 
GPU clock so that puts us just over what
this<00:02:25.410> GPU<00:02:25.860> can<00:02:26.010> actually<00:02:26.370> achieve<00:02:26.490> and<00:02:27.090> it

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
this GPU can actually achieve and it

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.080 
this GPU can actually achieve and it
gives<00:02:28.200> us<00:02:28.320> our<00:02:28.500> max<00:02:28.740> limit<00:02:29.220> this<00:02:29.400> is<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.670> really

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
gives us our max limit this is a really

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.420 
gives us our max limit this is a really
cool<00:02:30.330> little<00:02:30.450> tweak<00:02:30.840> for<00:02:31.430> extreme

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
cool little tweak for extreme

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.280 
cool little tweak for extreme
overclockers<00:02:33.000> who<00:02:33.300> really<00:02:33.720> want<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.050> best

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
overclockers who really want the best

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.840 
overclockers who really want the best
you<00:02:34.620> know<00:02:34.800> performance<00:02:35.520> when<00:02:35.730> they're

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
you know performance when they're

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.970 
you know performance when they're
overclocking<00:02:36.630> and<00:02:36.810> don't<00:02:37.350> want<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:37.650> have<00:02:37.830> to

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
overclocking and don't want to have to

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.900 
overclocking and don't want to have to
deal<00:02:38.160> with<00:02:38.370> those<00:02:40.100> what's<00:02:41.100> a<00:02:41.190> nice<00:02:41.340> way<00:02:41.550> to<00:02:41.580> put
