00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.270
 very good kids welcome one 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.340
 night more to the large field domains 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.470
 here we are with good and with james very 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.420
 good guys you want we go for this 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.859
 third episode of the nights pussies 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.029
 supervirus we followed where we were going 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:33.059
 we have to continue commenting on things from 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.530
 game is worth because because of the speed of 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.739
 the levels at those 100 seconds that 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.719
 we have instead of being able to comment all 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.640
 the characteristics of the game and 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.430
 limiting it you're going to be silly in 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.430
 later levels 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.410
 well here we remember memorize the 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.360
 letter from the red boxer that we had in 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.190
 medium and we're going to memorize it and the 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:58.190
 we keep looking to avoid it 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.190
 to be able to catch the rest of right 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:08.350
 in the first and second they were enough to 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.940
 give all the details of the game in this 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.320
 is spreading a little more the 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.970
 application but good always during 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.470
 all the chapters you always have to go 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.220
 commenting good things that are forgotten 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.420
 well it's important to comment on them say 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.920
 something that we could have already commented 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.250
 because it is one of the characteristics 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.160
 fundamentals of the game that within the 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.350
 playability there is a major change and 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.140
 is the control of the jumps and the 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.660
 precision of the cars both Luis and 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.970
 taxis discounted when they jump 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.470
 would kill and maintain a 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.340
 little in the air floats a little bit in 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.160
 air 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.460
 this is a characteristic that they have 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:48.009
 integrated into the game based on the 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:52.060
 jumps that made louis in the super 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:55.000
 mariobros 2 if you remember in the mario 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.369
 really use that is not a not 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.990
 properly a mario bros but that is the 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:03.290
 dock and dog hispanic 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.180
 with the aesthetics of mario they took advantage of 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.850
 aesthetic of mario to pull to 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.110
 fight the pull of tried to separate 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.209
 he tried to take advantage of the pull of his 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.150
 strange franchise and be able to sell more 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.610
 games in the usa and well, it's a game 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.560
 who became famous for being radically 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.260
 different from the rector mario mainly 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.830
 because this one is not a user then in this 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.410
 game 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.349
 Yet all the characters had a 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.810
 differentiating features all 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.190
 they were very fast louis and had that leap 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.440
 characteristic as we are saying 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.660
 putting the good legs battling a 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.850
 little of the leg and staying a 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:43.670
 little in the air and second coin of 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:46.660
 correct level and athens tremoleda 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.660
 the princess 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.380
 here we have the gold statue worth 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.900
 let's make the corresponding photo 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.900
 here we are the three points and we continue 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.180
 we continue because we have 18 seconds the 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.600
 time is short you have to get out of this 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.600
 pigtail 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:14.080
 but it escaped me good let's get 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.610
 a little bit in extremis but let's go in the 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.550
 moment we get distracted a little bit 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.450
 we run the risk of falling 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.450
 to do here 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.860
 we have rushed a little bit because when 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:30.340
 to say good 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.500
 when we passed the bad end gate 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.430
 they always reward them with 100 seconds 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:39.490
 extra 100 seconds to eliminate the 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:42.490
 evil enemy so good scheme 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:46.270
 classic 3 stomp of the head to this 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:49.090
 creature and we finish so good jumps 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.280
 more complicated than once good 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.560
 that we get used to because they facilitate 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.270
 little things in the sense that that 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.490
 small time that we face in the air 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.620
 and those great jumping possibilities 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.180
 distances last shortly then do not return 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.620
 leave super mario previous made first 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:09.220
 a little bit that ability of super jumps 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:11.530
 something good is to say by the way it is worth 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.270
 that characteristic that the van has put 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.510
 to keep in the new version that is going to 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:19.450
 leave for Paraguay from supermario in the 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:22.390
 super mario 3d word 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.980
 and we'll see that we have mariotto de la 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.420
 princess and they all keep those 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.790
 characteristics that we comment on 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.010
 husband gushed as we always got to the 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.260
 castle gives us the typical announcements of 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.940
 level and the ability to save 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.890
 fundamental departure whenever we 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.600
 we passed a castle we will not explain 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.190
 in this series many basic things of the 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.780
 game is worth as the themes of my time and 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.370
 some things are always 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.800
 commenting on differences with super god 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.440
 mariobros because everything else we have 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.180
 explained in the super Mario series and 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.340
 it would be good to reiterate about time 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.440
 so if anyone is interested in 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.210
 concrete things of the games not only of 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.680
 this expansion I recommend that if not 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.530
 you have done it since you see the series 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.120
 supermario especially Chapters 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.920
 within the world where we explain the 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.230
 main approach of the egg and the 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.660
 basic scheme of power so what 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.920
 said we leave it for today we see ourselves in the 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.720
 next chapter I hope that it has 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.620
 well passed a greeting in order a greeting 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.620
 long something
