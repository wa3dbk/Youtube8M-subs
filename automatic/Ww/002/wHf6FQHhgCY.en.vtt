able to get bow and not only that we

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.020 
able to get bow and not only that we

picked a bow without getting on cover
first<00:00:36.360> which<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:37.110> sometimes<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:38.010> doesn't<00:00:38.190> make

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
first which it sometimes it doesn't make

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.350 
first which it sometimes it doesn't make
a<00:00:38.340> difference<00:00:38.520> but<00:00:38.760> there<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.030> were<00:00:39.059> getting

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
them you know it's just that simple you

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.640 
them you know it's just that simple you
might<00:02:43.570> hit<00:02:43.690> them<00:02:43.810> every<00:02:43.990> now<00:02:44.110> and<00:02:44.260> then<00:02:44.380> but<00:02:44.560> if

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
might hit them every now and then but if

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:45.630

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
between two of my teammates each being

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.560 
between two of my teammates each being
rushed<00:02:54.490> by<00:02:54.640> two<00:02:54.700> guys<00:02:54.940> while<00:02:55.180> out<00:02:55.270> of<00:02:55.390> sniper

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
rushed by two guys while out of sniper

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.110 
rushed by two guys while out of sniper
so<00:02:56.020> i<00:02:56.230> put<00:02:56.920> myself<00:02:57.070> in<00:02:57.340> a<00:02:57.400> bad<00:02:57.520> situation<00:02:57.700> and

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
so i put myself in a bad situation and

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.420 
so i put myself in a bad situation and
put<00:02:58.300> them<00:02:58.450> all<00:02:58.720> in<00:02:58.870> bad<00:02:59.020> situations<00:02:59.430> meanwhile

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
put them all in bad situations meanwhile

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.949 
put them all in bad situations meanwhile
the<00:03:00.820> other<00:03:00.880> team<00:03:01.150> was<00:03:01.240> able<00:03:01.360> to<00:03:01.510> capitalize<00:03:01.930> on

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
the other team was able to capitalize on

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.260 
the other team was able to capitalize on
it<00:03:02.230> they've<00:03:02.410> made<00:03:02.709> to<00:03:02.980> really<00:03:03.340> smart<00:03:03.880> pushes

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
it they've made to really smart pushes

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.699 
it they've made to really smart pushes
might<00:03:04.930> have<00:03:05.050> been<00:03:05.140> a<00:03:05.170> little<00:03:05.320> bit<00:03:05.530> smarter

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
might have been a little bit smarter

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.310 
might have been a little bit smarter
just<00:03:05.890> take<00:03:06.220> out<00:03:06.340> one<00:03:06.640> guy<00:03:06.880> of<00:03:07.209> you<00:03:07.990> know<00:03:08.080> push

rather than two on each cuz it's not too
hard<00:03:12.760> that<00:03:13.030> you<00:03:13.270> know<00:03:13.330> it's<00:03:13.450> not<00:03:13.600> it's<00:03:13.930> not<00:03:14.050> out

mean<00:05:48.360> you<00:05:48.690> can't<00:05:48.930> really<00:05:49.140> let<00:05:49.230> that<00:05:49.410> happen<00:05:49.560> in

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
mean you can't really let that happen in

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.400 
mean you can't really let that happen in
a<00:05:49.890> 2v2<00:05:50.220> if<00:05:50.430> you<00:05:50.550> get<00:05:50.700> a<00:05:50.730> 2v1<00:05:51.090> situation<00:05:51.840> you've

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 
a 2v2 if you get a 2v1 situation you've

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:53.930 
a 2v2 if you get a 2v1 situation you've
got<00:05:52.650> to<00:05:52.770> make<00:05:52.860> the<00:05:52.950> most<00:05:53.070> of<00:05:53.250> it<00:05:53.370> because<00:05:53.610> the

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
got to make the most of it because the

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.910 
got to make the most of it because the
two<00:05:54.120> V<00:05:54.270> two<00:05:54.300> turns<00:05:54.660> into<00:05:54.810> a<00:05:54.900> 2v1<00:05:55.230> and<00:05:55.590> then<00:05:55.680> you

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:55.920 
two V two turns into a 2v1 and then you

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.380 
two V two turns into a 2v1 and then you
basically<00:05:56.100> won<00:05:56.520> the<00:05:56.670> round<00:05:56.790> if<00:05:57.030> you<00:05:57.120> can<00:05:57.240> play

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
basically won the round if you can play

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:01.190 
basically won the round if you can play
it<00:05:57.420> smart<00:05:57.660> enough<00:05:59.120> but<00:06:00.120> uh<00:06:00.150> you<00:06:00.720> know<00:06:00.750> that's

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:01.200 
it smart enough but uh you know that's

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.320 
it smart enough but uh you know that's
so<00:06:01.890> far<00:06:02.040> would<00:06:02.190> have<00:06:02.280> been<00:06:02.370> go<00:06:02.490> going<00:06:03.210> over

00:07:44.909 --> 00:07:44.919 
right here you poked out and then you

00:07:44.919 --> 00:07:46.950 
right here you poked out and then you

die now he's already poking out so if

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.269

00:07:48.269 --> 00:07:48.279 
you're going to take the shot you can't

00:07:48.279 --> 00:07:49.559 
you're going to take the shot you can't
put<00:07:48.460> yourself<00:07:48.879> out<00:07:49.089> there<00:07:49.120> because<00:07:49.360> you're

00:07:49.559 --> 00:07:49.569 
put yourself out there because you're

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:51.329 
put yourself out there because you're
already<00:07:49.779> weak<00:07:50.080> all<00:07:50.439> you<00:07:50.680> have<00:07:50.770> to<00:07:50.860> do<00:07:50.949> is<00:07:51.069> blind

00:07:51.329 --> 00:07:51.339 
already weak all you have to do is blind

00:07:51.339 --> 00:07:53.219 
already weak all you have to do is blind
fire<00:07:51.550> off<00:07:51.789> cover<00:07:52.029> if<00:07:52.240> you<00:07:52.509> blind<00:07:52.779> fire<00:07:52.960> on<00:07:53.139> the

00:07:53.219 --> 00:07:53.229 
fire off cover if you blind fire on the

00:07:53.229 --> 00:07:55.290 
fire off cover if you blind fire on the
cover<00:07:53.490> you<00:07:54.490> might<00:07:54.639> get<00:07:54.759> down<00:07:54.939> because<00:07:55.210> there's

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:55.300 
cover you might get down because there's

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.089 
cover you might get down because there's
still<00:07:55.539> weak<00:07:55.719> but<00:07:55.960> it's<00:07:56.439> better<00:07:56.710> than<00:07:56.830> just

00:07:57.089 --> 00:07:57.099 
still weak but it's better than just

00:07:57.099 --> 00:07:58.350 
still weak but it's better than just
sitting<00:07:57.159> there<00:07:57.370> and<00:07:57.520> taking<00:07:57.759> a<00:07:57.939> shot<00:07:58.149> because

00:07:58.350 --> 00:07:58.360 
sitting there and taking a shot because

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.749 
sitting there and taking a shot because
if<00:07:58.479> you<00:07:58.599> take<00:07:58.629> the<00:07:58.930> shot<00:07:59.169> out<00:07:59.500> of<00:08:00.219> cover<00:08:00.460> he's

00:08:00.749 --> 00:08:00.759 
if you take the shot out of cover he's

00:08:00.759 --> 00:08:02.519 
if you take the shot out of cover he's
got<00:08:00.909> an<00:08:01.000> easy<00:08:01.270> shot<00:08:01.569> on<00:08:01.629> you<00:08:01.930> you<00:08:02.289> could<00:08:02.439> have

00:08:02.519 --> 00:08:02.529 
got an easy shot on you you could have

00:08:02.529 --> 00:08:03.659 
got an easy shot on you you could have
just<00:08:02.620> waited<00:08:02.800> for<00:08:03.009> your<00:08:03.069> health<00:08:03.250> to<00:08:03.370> come<00:08:03.520> back

00:08:03.659 --> 00:08:03.669 
just waited for your health to come back

00:08:03.669 --> 00:08:04.469 
just waited for your health to come back
and<00:08:03.759> then<00:08:03.879> you<00:08:03.939> could<00:08:04.060> have<00:08:04.149> blind<00:08:04.330> fight

00:08:04.469 --> 00:08:04.479 
and then you could have blind fight

00:08:04.479 --> 00:08:05.850 
and then you could have blind fight
around<00:08:04.659> cover<00:08:04.899> and<00:08:05.080> probably<00:08:05.379> gotten<00:08:05.649> a<00:08:05.710> one

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:05.860 
around cover and probably gotten a one

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.409 
around cover and probably gotten a one
shot<00:08:06.069> now<00:08:06.520> I<00:08:06.580> don't<00:08:06.789> like<00:08:06.879> to<00:08:06.909> talk<00:08:07.089> too<00:08:07.300> much

00:08:07.409 --> 00:08:07.419 
shot now I don't like to talk too much

00:08:07.419 --> 00:08:08.939 
shot now I don't like to talk too much
about<00:08:07.479> one-on-one<00:08:08.110> situations<00:08:08.680> because<00:08:08.830> it

00:08:08.939 --> 00:08:08.949 
about one-on-one situations because it

00:08:08.949 --> 00:08:10.290 
about one-on-one situations because it
really<00:08:09.490> just<00:08:09.669> comes<00:08:09.729> down<00:08:09.909> to<00:08:10.029> preference

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:10.300 
really just comes down to preference

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:11.939 
really just comes down to preference
those<00:08:10.899> are<00:08:11.020> one<00:08:11.110> of<00:08:11.199> those<00:08:11.259> situations<00:08:11.499> where

00:08:11.939 --> 00:08:11.949 
those are one of those situations where

00:08:11.949 --> 00:08:14.100 
those are one of those situations where
if<00:08:12.129> the<00:08:12.219> guys<00:08:12.370> around<00:08:12.939> cover<00:08:13.270> all<00:08:13.539> you<00:08:13.870> have<00:08:13.990> to

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:14.110 
if the guys around cover all you have to

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:15.269 
if the guys around cover all you have to
do<00:08:14.199> is<00:08:14.289> blind<00:08:14.560> fire<00:08:14.740> you<00:08:14.860> don't<00:08:14.979> have<00:08:15.069> to<00:08:15.159> put

00:08:15.269 --> 00:08:15.279 
do is blind fire you don't have to put

do is blind fire you don't have to put
yourself<00:08:15.370> into<00:08:15.729> a<00:08:15.789> bad<00:08:15.969> situation<00:08:15.999> like<00:08:16.689> that
