the C's technically should be in there
stretched<00:01:29.700> position<00:01:30.000> which<00:01:30.450> means<00:01:30.689> they

00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:30.929 
stretched position which means they

behind<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.299> first<00:01:39.569> finger<00:01:40.110> so<00:01:40.590> just<00:01:40.829> have

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
behind the first finger so just have

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.010 
behind the first finger so just have
them<00:01:41.189> back<00:01:41.429> next<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:41.969> first<00:01:42.240> finger<00:01:42.539> and

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.100 
them back next to the first finger and
then<00:01:43.200> in<00:01:43.350> bar<00:01:43.560> five<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.340> says<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:44.970> C<00:01:45.329> sharp<00:01:45.750> again

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
then in bar five it says a C sharp again

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.449 
then in bar five it says a C sharp again
as<00:01:46.530> normal<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:47.009> you're<00:01:47.130> going<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.340> be

00:01:47.449 --> 00:01:47.459 
as normal so you're going to be

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:50.149 
as normal so you're going to be
stretching<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:48.750> C<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:49.679> if<00:01:49.739> I<00:01:49.799> take<00:01:50.009> you

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
stretching that C so if I take you

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.669 
stretching that C so if I take you
through<00:01:50.189> bar<00:01:50.670> four<00:01:51.209> it<00:01:51.630> will<00:01:51.780> be<00:01:51.989> there<00:01:52.500> so

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
through bar four it will be there so

00:01:52.679 --> 00:02:00.620 
through bar four it will be there so
they're<00:01:52.829> back<00:01:52.979> twos<00:01:55.880> now<00:01:56.880> stretch<00:01:58.970> and<00:01:59.970> then

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
they're back twos now stretch and then

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.300 
they're back twos now stretch and then
you<00:02:00.720> can<00:02:00.929> just<00:02:01.110> carry<00:02:01.409> on<00:02:01.500> as<00:02:01.829> normal

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
you can just carry on as normal

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.359 
you can just carry on as normal
watch<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.360> fourth<00:02:03.599> finger<00:02:03.899> for<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.289> B<00:02:04.530> in<00:02:04.770> bar

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
watch the fourth finger for the B in bar

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.130 
watch the fourth finger for the B in bar
seven<00:02:05.909> just<00:02:06.090> make<00:02:06.299> sure<00:02:06.509> that's<00:02:06.659> stretched

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
seven just make sure that's stretched

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.500 
seven just make sure that's stretched
enough<00:02:10.250> so<00:02:11.250> that<00:02:11.280> B<00:02:11.640> is<00:02:11.910> gonna<00:02:12.030> be<00:02:12.269> a<00:02:12.299> good

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
enough so that B is gonna be a good

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.240 
enough so that B is gonna be a good
finger<00:02:12.959> width<00:02:13.140> away<00:02:13.500> so<00:02:13.560> if<00:02:13.799> you<00:02:13.920> think<00:02:14.160> the

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
finger width away so if you think the

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.979 
finger width away so if you think the
third<00:02:14.489> finger<00:02:14.910> is<00:02:15.030> gonna<00:02:15.120> be<00:02:15.329> on<00:02:15.510> that<00:02:15.720> dot

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
third finger is gonna be on that dot

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.080 
third finger is gonna be on that dot
that<00:02:16.500> B<00:02:16.709> is<00:02:16.859> normally<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.280> good<00:02:17.519> finger<00:02:17.910> width

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
that B is normally a good finger width

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.050 
that B is normally a good finger width
apart<00:02:18.269> so<00:02:18.750> basically<00:02:19.500> if<00:02:19.680> I<00:02:19.829> can<00:02:20.069> put<00:02:20.280> my<00:02:20.519> put

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
apart so basically if I can put my put

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.789 
apart so basically if I can put my put
my<00:02:21.120> third<00:02:21.389> finger<00:02:21.630> down<00:02:21.900> put<00:02:21.930> my<00:02:22.230> other<00:02:22.410> finger

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
my third finger down put my other finger

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:24.680 
my third finger down put my other finger
next<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.130> it<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.609> then<00:02:23.910> put<00:02:24.120> my<00:02:24.150> fourth<00:02:24.510> finger

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
next to it and then put my fourth finger

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.690 
next to it and then put my fourth finger
take<00:02:25.049> it<00:02:25.200> away<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.680> that's<00:02:25.829> how<00:02:26.250> much<00:02:26.489> of<00:02:26.639> a

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
take it away and that's how much of a

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.449 
take it away and that's how much of a
gap<00:02:26.910> I<00:02:27.150> need<00:02:27.389> for<00:02:27.690> that<00:02:27.810> B<00:02:28.230> so<00:02:28.799> just<00:02:28.980> be<00:02:29.160> aware

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
gap I need for that B so just be aware

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.250 
gap I need for that B so just be aware
that<00:02:29.519> that<00:02:29.819> is<00:02:30.060> in<00:02:30.329> tune<00:02:30.630> otherwise<00:02:30.989> it'll

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
that that is in tune otherwise it'll

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.059 
that that is in tune otherwise it'll
sound<00:02:33.019> nobody<00:02:34.019> wants<00:02:34.319> that<00:02:34.350> so<00:02:34.709> just<00:02:34.739> make

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
sound nobody wants that so just make

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.289 
sound nobody wants that so just make
sure<00:02:35.100> it<00:02:35.370> is<00:02:35.519> wide<00:02:35.970> enough<00:02:38.060> it<00:02:39.060> would<00:02:39.180> be<00:02:39.269> a

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
sure it is wide enough it would be a

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.330 
sure it is wide enough it would be a
good<00:02:39.480> idea<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:39.959> just<00:02:40.200> you<00:02:40.470> look<00:02:40.680> at<00:02:40.889> the<00:02:40.980> violin

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
good idea to just you look at the violin

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.860 
good idea to just you look at the violin
at<00:02:41.430> that<00:02:41.549> point<00:02:41.880> just<00:02:42.090> so<00:02:42.150> you're<00:02:42.389> not<00:02:42.420> kind<00:02:42.780> of

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
at that point just so you're not kind of

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.479 
at that point just so you're not kind of
you're<00:02:43.380> not<00:02:43.500> looking<00:02:43.769> at<00:02:43.859> the<00:02:43.950> music<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.400> then

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
you're not looking at the music and then

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:45.710 
you're not looking at the music and then
put<00:02:44.670> a<00:02:44.700> guessing<00:02:45.090> where<00:02:45.239> you've<00:02:45.359> got<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:45.599> put

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
put a guessing where you've got to put

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.680 
put a guessing where you've got to put
your<00:02:45.840> finger<00:02:46.109> down<00:02:46.340> so<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:48.120> only<00:02:48.269> other<00:02:48.389> part

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
your finger down so the only other part

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.890 
your finger down so the only other part
is<00:02:48.930> probably<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.769> last<00:02:50.099> sort<00:02:50.579> of<00:02:50.639> few<00:02:51.090> few

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
is probably the the last sort of few few

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.120 
is probably the the last sort of few few
bars<00:02:52.109> at<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.319> end<00:02:52.470> where<00:02:52.650> you've<00:02:52.769> got<00:02:52.920> those

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
bars at the end where you've got those

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.890 
bars at the end where you've got those
Cueva<00:02:53.609> all<00:02:53.700> those<00:02:53.849> eighth<00:02:54.090> notes<00:02:54.150> just

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
Cueva all those eighth notes just

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:06.060 
Cueva all those eighth notes just
practice<00:02:55.410> those

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.620 

so<00:03:07.070> it's<00:03:07.220> just<00:03:07.370> nice<00:03:07.610> slow<00:03:07.940> practice<00:03:08.180> but

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
so it's just nice slow practice but

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.450 
so it's just nice slow practice but
basically<00:03:09.110> they're<00:03:09.260> either<00:03:09.410> all<00:03:09.710> arpeggios

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:10.460 
basically they're either all arpeggios

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.390 
basically they're either all arpeggios
or<00:03:10.730> mostly<00:03:11.720> scales<00:03:12.260> so<00:03:12.590> it's<00:03:12.740> it<00:03:13.070> should<00:03:13.280> be

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
or mostly scales so it's it should be

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.460 
or mostly scales so it's it should be
fairly<00:03:13.700> self-explanatory<00:03:14.150> you've<00:03:15.080> got<00:03:15.260> some

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
fairly self-explanatory you've got some

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.650 
fairly self-explanatory you've got some
more<00:03:15.740> up<00:03:16.040> the<00:03:16.190> top<00:03:16.400> there<00:03:16.430> in<00:03:16.730> bar<00:03:16.940> nine<00:03:17.390> and

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
more up the top there in bar nine and

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:18.070 
more up the top there in bar nine and
ten

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
ten

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.290 
ten
but<00:03:18.380> again<00:03:18.590> just<00:03:18.830> a<00:03:18.890> nice<00:03:19.070> flow<00:03:19.370> practice<00:03:19.880> this

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
but again just a nice flow practice this

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.880 
but again just a nice flow practice this
should<00:03:20.510> be<00:03:20.570> taking<00:03:20.870> a<00:03:20.930> quite<00:03:21.170> a<00:03:21.200> steady<00:03:21.620> speed

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
should be taking a quite a steady speed

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.620 
should be taking a quite a steady speed
but<00:03:22.400> I<00:03:22.430> mean<00:03:22.670> you<00:03:22.790> can<00:03:22.940> sort<00:03:23.150> of<00:03:23.180> play<00:03:23.300> a<00:03:23.390> little

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
but I mean you can sort of play a little

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:24.910 
but I mean you can sort of play a little
bit<00:03:23.810> slower<00:03:24.050> you<00:03:24.230> can<00:03:24.320> play<00:03:24.500> a<00:03:24.530> little<00:03:24.740> bit

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
bit slower you can play a little bit

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.280 
bit slower you can play a little bit
faster<00:03:25.400> however<00:03:25.580> you<00:03:25.820> sort<00:03:26.060> of<00:03:26.150> feel<00:03:26.840> the<00:03:27.080> mood

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
faster however you sort of feel the mood

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.230 
faster however you sort of feel the mood
so<00:03:27.650> it<00:03:27.710> suits<00:03:27.980> you<00:03:28.250> for<00:03:28.520> last<00:03:28.880> night

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.240 
so it suits you for last night

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.960 
so it suits you for last night
in<00:03:29.480> Paris<00:03:29.890> so<00:03:30.890> there<00:03:31.400> we<00:03:31.490> go<00:03:31.520> I<00:03:31.640> think<00:03:31.730> that's
