00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
too much of a flat area so I decided to

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.309 
too much of a flat area so I decided to
go<00:01:16.950> ahead<00:01:17.069> and<00:01:17.310> move<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.520> up<00:01:17.640> here<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:20.000> clean<00:01:21.000> the

go ahead and move it up here I clean the

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:27.699 
go ahead and move it up here I clean the
mounting<00:01:22.319> surface<00:01:22.530> with<00:01:22.860> rubbing<00:01:23.190> alcohol

00:01:27.699 --> 00:01:27.709 

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:32.150 

this<00:01:28.709> appears<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.220> be<00:01:29.310> masking<00:01:29.910> tape<00:01:31.160> and

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
this appears to be masking tape and

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.029 
this appears to be masking tape and
again<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.520> know<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:32.940> sticker<00:01:33.270> really<00:01:34.039> wasn't

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
put on this cover for this chain a

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.820 
put on this cover for this chain a
little<00:01:56.100> gold<00:01:57.060> wing<00:01:57.270> album<00:01:57.630> emblem<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.440> had<00:01:58.650> to

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
little gold wing album emblem I had to

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.030 
little gold wing album emblem I had to
take<00:01:59.730> off<00:01:59.940> because<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.360> wouldn't<00:02:00.570> fit<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:01.080> tried

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
take off because it wouldn't fit I tried

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.190 
take off because it wouldn't fit I tried
to<00:02:02.160> rub<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.520> little<00:02:02.730> bit<00:02:02.910> better<00:02:03.200> that

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
to rub it a little bit better that

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.140 
to rub it a little bit better that
little<00:02:04.530> gold<00:02:04.800> wing<00:02:05.010> stripe<00:02:05.340> there<00:02:05.550> come<00:02:05.760> off<00:02:05.940> I

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
little gold wing stripe there come off I

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.950 
little gold wing stripe there come off I
think<00:02:06.210> because<00:02:06.540> there's<00:02:06.690> a<00:02:06.750> little

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
think because there's a little

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:21.490 
think because there's a little
imperfection<00:02:07.650> there<00:02:08.420> so<00:02:09.420> see<00:02:09.930> how<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.229> did
