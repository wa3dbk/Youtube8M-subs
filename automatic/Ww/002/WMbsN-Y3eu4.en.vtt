00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:15.430
 welcome back friends and here's a guide 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.560
 even today a guide a moment longer 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.780
 particular than usual because 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.990
 because it happened in the past few days 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.370
 I don't know you corn happened to have 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.880
 in the row of the remote control of 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:32.039
 machine downloads and files of you happens to 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:36.070
 all so pity i have a car 

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:37.989
 called renault the ford a car 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.760
 call these keychains renault 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:43.600
 this of the bank so you don't 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.760
 case card is made ok 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.220
 the only thing being unloaded is not 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.450
 it even allows you to open it to close it 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.600
 then they told me it's very easy 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:56.230
 guard opens this way 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:59.590
 here you will find a button you can see it 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.840
 awards that this is the key of 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.750
 I don't know how to open the door 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.810
 if you are aware of it all and from here 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.389
 he takes off the battery to which I have looked 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.509
 as you can see this looks like a button 

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:16.030
 so I would like to make them out and 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:17.459
 premium and press two prizes 3 I don't have it 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.109
 done 

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:22.389
 the machine's instructions may be 

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:24.639
 clear maybe I didn't understand you well 

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:28.090
 anyway I will explain it to you as you do to 

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:30.310
 replace the battery you take 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.679
 first of all we must not push in 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.479
 forward because as you can see it does not happen 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:36.539
 absolutely nothing take a 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.759
 thin screwdriver I at this time 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:41.439
 I have these keys or these scissors then 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.119
 I will use these because they have the 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.149
 thin terminal this that me 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.149
 interest 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:51.840
 let's just go for leverage and 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:54.899
 I hope I will play without slaughtering 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.049
 he has waited for it and that regards yes it is seen 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.530
 without it we can't create anything we should 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.530
 do it 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:07.979
 here he is not pretending to never 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.229
 prying up this is done in 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:14.400
 this way that these little teeth have 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:18.840
 you see it's pressure is not to push and from 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:21.930
 here after it's simple just push it out 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.870
 get up in the morning i come away i do 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.739
 also see in the house of reno the pile that 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.450
 mark has made it so I bought it 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.540
 I also found it original in 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:37.500
 hardware just the same 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:41.340
 ok and go with the side as you see 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.739
 I think the most is behind can key with the 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.890
 the more you put it in this way 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:49.950
 simply within and after the 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:56.280
 cap the honors placed over it 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:58.530
 support ok then press done will be one 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.769
 bullshit I still didn't make it 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:05.609
 immediately so I wanted to share it with 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:08.430
 you so that you will never happen if 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:11.370
 never have a renault the only real in the 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.810
 my discomfort of having trouble doing is 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.880
 change the line 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.090
 thanks for your attention and the next 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.090
 Hello
