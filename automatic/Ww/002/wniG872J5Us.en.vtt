00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:06.860
 little trick to disconnect and respect for people who wish 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.940
 so to Europe it is not necessarily 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.459
 all the time but that's if you need to ride chains 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:18.230
 also there is snow or in some cases on my flat in this example class 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.999
 b 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:20.769
 so percent 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:23.769
 turn acs position one hour 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:27.849
 no we are sure we are waiting 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.919
 you have to put this on the opposition 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.280
 that's the weirdest sica partial or total 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.360
 and then three times on their recipes would have reached 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.110
 1 since 3 c 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.600
 emma the voltage that reigned battery voltage 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.260
 attention of course Roman 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.470
 - in this case the engine being 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.519
 before 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:57.270
 Annecy checks this time the tension of an Austrian humanplasma interested 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.680
 engine is a motor turning see if the industry and as for bonuses and the 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.590
 charger 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.100
 working more 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.239
 then we will go 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.020
 for 100 euros thereafter with him arrow to the group 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.970
 we have characteristics 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.320
 I am poor relative 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.200
 cars for once we have the engine 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.960
 as for the engine running in my the oil level of temperature of 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.540
 oil 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.810
 and here we come on the menu to test the spe 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:27.720
 good job 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.720
 so convinced that once on the most 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.870
 so here we are friends 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.270
 walkers 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.420
 so in this case 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.420
 more than just start 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.800
 the big tells us the inmate insurer was off 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.180
 the bscr 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.390
 and the sp does not work 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.690
 So here is 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.410
 he's seeing him stay lit 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.250
 the triangle 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.250
 he down from October for road tests 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.260
 since 2007 more respect of course be very careful 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.350
 only for use in the Caribbean yes 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.889
 Respect does not bother you are happy and I thank all 

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:19.189
 another problem to do this the opposite would have been an engine 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:29.200
 in this case when the sarladais who fixed the time came but otherwise must do 

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:31.039
 in the opposite case 

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:34.039
 so we just have to go on the month 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:36.349
 here 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.419
 it's the case 

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:40.049
 pressing 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.049
 c key we went out of the menu 

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:46.669
 the counter is still dead 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:50.459
 everything is in order 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:51.019
 it's perfect
