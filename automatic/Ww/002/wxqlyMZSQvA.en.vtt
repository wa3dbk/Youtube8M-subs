00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
you can use it for speed if you need it

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.270 
you can use it for speed if you need it
as<00:01:29.460> for<00:01:29.850> thora<00:01:30.000> GDB<00:01:30.570> does<00:01:30.750> have<00:01:30.960> 83<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:31.950> it's<00:01:32.189> a

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.719 
mind other than that like I said before
he<00:01:46.500> actually<00:01:46.710> throws<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.250> ball<00:01:47.430> really

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
he actually throws the ball really

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.179 
he actually throws the ball really
smooth<00:01:48.270> he's<00:01:48.509> very<00:01:48.780> accurate<00:01:49.350> on<00:01:49.500> mid-range<00:01:49.799> a

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
smooth he's very accurate on mid-range a

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.670 
smooth he's very accurate on mid-range a
short-range<00:01:51.060> throws<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.049> actually<00:01:52.259> really

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
short-range throws so I actually really

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.730 
short-range throws so I actually really
love<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:52.890> scar<00:01:53.579> does<00:01:53.759> have<00:01:54.020> 95<00:01:55.020> star<00:01:55.259> power<00:01:55.439> I

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
love that scar does have 95 star power I

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.709 
love that scar does have 95 star power I
