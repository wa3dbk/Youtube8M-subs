00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.980
 I liked it, it was really cool with much more 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.620

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.930
 I will talk a little youtube 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.660
 happens when the contract of the 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.230
 youtube with apple then you do not need 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.640
 more 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.010
 apple did not need to put in the 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.510
 youtube as native application then the 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.519
 youtube has now created an app 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.640
 as you can see that is the 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.890
 youtube application and it was a 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.360
 application good little ruined well

 and as you can see here in one of the most 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.080
 downloaded first of all from the 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.209
 youtube precisely because of how it ended 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.580
 the contract and youtube no longer 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.420
