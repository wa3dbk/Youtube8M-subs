00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.730
 and we are going to use Miguel del Monte 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.410
 trying a bit to be arid is 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.320
 easy at the beginning of the season but 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.599
 well we came early we will try 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.400
 until the last minute now we can get 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.900
 the reality is in an access fishing 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.940
 public and we are going to play different 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.220
 points in this case we are close to the 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.160
 of the mountain gate with the 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.830
 partridges then we will go looking towards 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.320
 the lagoon of the partridges we are going to treat 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.850
 to also test the totoral mouth 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.920
 of the stream control the mount so 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.750
 good walking a little bit at the beginning 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.470
 of season looking for tarariras with 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.470
 artificial 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.350
 and 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.980
 with evolution of tasks we are then 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:35.780
 playing different match points 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:37.670
 I counted has returned to see it is not itch but 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.330
 We are at the beginning of the season and 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.330
 I'm getting better 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.810
 it is not usually 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:25.680
 but it has a lot of fishing situation 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:29.480
 Pepa when dropped in the spoon 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:38.630
 on a rubber that is lost 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:40.460
 carla moves 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.730
 good this case osasuna the little 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.730
 size 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:56.810
 It is hard to need to look for these 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:03:03.180
 shelters in calm 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:06.000
 because it is very difficult to have to 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.720
 structure a water inlet that 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.940
 get from edges of fields 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.700
 Well, these are the places of water 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.610
 Atlantic home so the combination 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:22.760
 rubber and lord or white to recycle 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.760
 season that we are going to follow to the best 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.410
 i 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.470
 friends, we are finishing the days 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.420
 from the point where we started the 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.730
 traveled today in san miguel del monte 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.380
 we have touched several points we have gone to 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.920
 a little ball of the partridges we have touched 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:30.470
 a stream on route 41 we have returned 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.360
 to the mountain to fish in what is called the 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.820
 mouth of the totoral and in another sector that 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.860
 called the aguada and we ended up giving the 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:40.160
 back here at our starting point 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:42.800
 that was directly this island that is 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.110
 100 meters before the gate that connects 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:49.910
 mount with the partridges the results 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:52.040
 have been very variable it was not constant 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.720
 nor even the pique had to scratch 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.610
 some here and some over there but 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.800
 that's what search fishing for 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.990
 trial and error to see what is going on 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.000
 and in this beginning of season and with 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.250
 a storm of closures and this wind 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.530
 they do not forgive us all day we did 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.700
 a pretty dictated harvest we're 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.500
 talking about access fisheries 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.680
 public is that those who suffer a lot 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:15.410
 fishing pressure and good an alternative 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.000
 valid for good to come in family spend 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.850
 a weekend save a few weights 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.440
 because this does not cost money and make 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.860
 some fishing of such flour that goes to 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.930
 to have 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.580
 it yields better insofar as it goes 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.050
 raising the temperature to the month of 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.389
 November so I hope that you have 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:32.590
 liked everything is fishing with lures san 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:32.590
 Miguel del Monte in Tarariras
