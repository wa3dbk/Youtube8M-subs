00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.820

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.849

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.420

 mobile los review 1 part one of two 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.310
 share part now we start from scratch 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.050
 at the story 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.309
 There is not much in this game 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.860
 story to say there me 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.079
 singles campaign not games because 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.360
 is boring but should be good 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.730
 So I say five and ten points 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.040
 story people are not bad but not 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.270
 as good as battlefield engine arms it 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.430
 There are many weapons here 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.340
 select some are very good but the 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.250
 most weapon types are ak 47 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.360
 kalashnikov in small and large 16 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.129
 up to 120 grenades respectively 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.170
 grenades launcher rockets 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.570
 launcher mufflers and many 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.119
 garnets and garnets smoke 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.710
 as well as explosions sorry characters 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.369
 fit well but are not bad 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.200
 six slash 10 multiplayer one 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.360
 very big brother with very many 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.850
 possibilities more possible player that 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.460
 play the other worlds all the way to 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.380
 many play barns in the game or 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.630
 shooting is possible here for a long time 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.820
 therefore nothing good but nothing 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.369
 see new four slash because often 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.500
 times connection problems server cards 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:41.400
 favorite maps are itchy and the one 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:43.860
 snow card da 0 slash 10 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.140
 So I've been reviewing for a while 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.090
 longer game as you can tell but me 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.149
 have to say how this game has 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.369
 clearly more or less certain 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.530
 attention deserves to play well 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.140
 It is also suitable with friends too 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.509
 Play and have fun with you all the time 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.610
 So it's worth buying if it is 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.820
 you like the colon bracket 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:10.470
 qualitative evaluation in differences 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:17.370
 5 slash 10.6 dash 10 + 4 stroke 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:21.990
 10 + 0 slash 10 05 06 04 +0 is 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:27.500
 equal to 15 note 1 5 bracket spread 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.500
 bread sausage brace to calm down
