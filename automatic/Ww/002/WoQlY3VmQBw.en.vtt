00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
that change may be faster can change it

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.960 
that change may be faster can change it
quicker<00:01:30.240> than<00:01:30.540> we<00:01:30.750> didn't<00:01:31.170> matter<00:01:31.320> but<00:01:32.310> I

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
quicker than we didn't matter but I

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.200 
quicker than we didn't matter but I
think<00:01:33.659> it's<00:01:34.880> a<00:01:36.409> little<00:01:37.409> bit<00:01:37.619> along<00:01:37.979> way<00:01:38.210> what's

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
think it's a little bit along way what's

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.010 
think it's a little bit along way what's
your<00:01:39.270> vvv<00:01:39.900> um<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:41.180> believe<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.329> varies<00:01:42.840> from

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
your vvv um I believe it varies from

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.510 
your vvv um I believe it varies from
country<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.439> country<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.070> depends<00:01:44.340> on<00:01:44.460> the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
country to country and it depends on the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.010 
country to country and it depends on the
level<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.909> development<00:01:45.119> in<00:01:45.420> countries<00:01:45.810> we<00:01:45.990> say

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
level of development in countries we say

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.109 
level of development in countries we say
for<00:01:46.409> example<00:01:46.470> internet<00:01:47.220> use<00:01:47.430> in<00:01:47.610> Kenya<00:01:47.939> it's

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
for example internet use in Kenya it's

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.420 
for example internet use in Kenya it's
pretty<00:01:48.810> high<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.680> find<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.950> lot<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.189> people

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
pretty high and you find a lot of people

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.030 
pretty high and you find a lot of people
actually<00:01:50.549> booking<00:01:50.939> on<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.240> internet<00:01:51.710> so<00:01:52.710> that
