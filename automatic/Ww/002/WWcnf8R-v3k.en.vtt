this<00:01:38.579> team<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:38.939> star<00:01:39.780> me<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.500> little<00:01:41.040> bit

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
this team and star me is a little bit

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.910 
this team and star me is a little bit
wild<00:01:41.310> bison<00:01:41.579> relax<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:43.170> wanted<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.740> save

wallet later game so now I'm kicking him

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.380 
wallet later game so now I'm kicking him
to<00:01:52.200> go<00:01:52.320> back<00:01:52.500> into<00:01:52.680> his<00:01:52.860> heatran<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:54.000> I'm<00:01:54.270> gonna

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
to go back into his heatran so I'm gonna

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.840 
to go back into his heatran so I'm gonna
go<00:01:54.570> into<00:01:54.750> my<00:01:54.840> star<00:01:55.200> me<00:01:55.350> because<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.680> he<00:01:56.189> he<00:01:56.640> knows

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
go into my star me because I he he knows

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.700 
go into my star me because I he he knows
his<00:01:56.880> heatran<00:01:57.450> will<00:01:57.630> wall<00:01:57.810> myself<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.619> that's

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
his heatran will wall myself and that's

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.990 
his heatran will wall myself and that's
what<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.130> usually<00:01:59.250> do<00:01:59.549> when<00:01:59.759> there's<00:01:59.969> a

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
what you usually do when there's a

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.959 
what you usually do when there's a
double<00:02:00.299> kill<00:02:00.479> but<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.619> go<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.460> star<00:02:02.790> me

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
double kill but I go to star me

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.249 
double kill but I go to star me
predicting<00:02:03.540> that<00:02:03.630> he<00:02:03.780> trained<00:02:03.960> that<00:02:04.079> was<00:02:04.200> a

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
predicting that he trained that was a

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.840 
predicting that he trained that was a
really<00:02:04.500> good<00:02:04.740> play<00:02:04.920> on<00:02:04.950> my<00:02:05.219> part<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.640> now<00:02:05.790> I'm

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
really good play on my part and now I'm

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.089 
really good play on my part and now I'm
gonna<00:02:06.000> go<00:02:06.180> into<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.630> star<00:02:06.869> me<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.530> I'm<00:02:07.950> gonna

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
gonna go into the star me and I'm gonna

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.919 
gonna go into the star me and I'm gonna
go<00:02:08.190> for<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.369> hydro<00:02:08.729> pump<00:02:08.879> on<00:02:09.090> his<00:02:09.420> switch<00:02:09.720> out

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
go for a hydro pump on his switch out

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.170 
go for a hydro pump on his switch out
and<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.679> easy<00:02:10.860> go<00:02:11.099> into<00:02:11.310> jirachi<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.060> that's

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
and that easy go into jirachi and that's

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.880 
and that easy go into jirachi and that's
going<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.360> hit<00:02:12.510> it<00:02:12.540> really<00:02:12.810> really<00:02:13.050> hard<00:02:13.260> I

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
going to hit it really really hard I

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:14.990 
going to hit it really really hard I
get<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.220> crib<00:02:14.460> doesn't<00:02:14.730> really<00:02:14.850> matter

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
get the crib doesn't really matter

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.309 
get the crib doesn't really matter
because<00:02:15.180> that<00:02:15.450> is<00:02:15.630> scarf<00:02:15.900> actually<00:02:16.230> the

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
because that is scarf actually the

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.660 
because that is scarf actually the
second<00:02:16.620> Hydra<00:02:16.860> bout<00:02:16.980> definitely<00:02:17.460> what<00:02:17.580> had

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
second Hydra bout definitely what had

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.990 
second Hydra bout definitely what had
killed<00:02:17.850> it<00:02:18.620> so<00:02:19.620> nice<00:02:19.770> he<00:02:19.890> knows<00:02:20.069> Swampert<00:02:20.550> and

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
killed it so nice he knows Swampert and

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.809 
killed it so nice he knows Swampert and
I<00:02:21.390> know<00:02:21.450> Swampert<00:02:22.260> even<00:02:23.040> if<00:02:23.250> he<00:02:23.370> does<00:02:23.550> for<00:02:23.730> the

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
I know Swampert even if he does for the

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.110 
I know Swampert even if he does for the
ice<00:02:23.910> beam<00:02:24.180> I<00:02:24.480> know<00:02:25.190> Celebi<00:02:26.190> doesn't<00:02:26.610> take<00:02:26.790> too

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
ice beam I know Celebi doesn't take too

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.220 
ice beam I know Celebi doesn't take too
much<00:02:27.150> damage<00:02:27.330> from<00:02:27.750> it<00:02:27.900> so<00:02:27.959> I'm<00:02:28.020> not<00:02:28.170> too

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
much damage from it so I'm not too

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.230 
much damage from it so I'm not too
worried<00:02:28.680> now<00:02:29.430> I'm<00:02:29.550> your<00:02:29.640> predicted<00:02:30.060> switch

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
worried now I'm your predicted switch

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.370 
worried now I'm your predicted switch
here<00:02:30.420> i'm<00:02:30.510> gonna<00:02:30.660> go<00:02:30.750> with<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.959> leech<00:02:31.140> seed

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
here i'm gonna go with the leech seed

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.320 
here i'm gonna go with the leech seed
instead<00:02:31.709> of<00:02:32.220> going<00:02:32.430> for<00:02:32.550> the<00:02:32.580> energy<00:02:32.760> ball<00:02:33.090> and

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
instead of going for the energy ball and

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.300 
instead of going for the energy ball and
that<00:02:33.959> wasn't<00:02:34.260> really<00:02:34.530> too<00:02:34.770> bad<00:02:34.890> we'll<00:02:35.100> play

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
that wasn't really too bad we'll play

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.280 
that wasn't really too bad we'll play
but<00:02:35.820> he<00:02:35.910> goes<00:02:36.060> for<00:02:36.209> the<00:02:36.270> war<00:02:36.480> predicting<00:02:37.050> leave

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
but he goes for the war predicting leave

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.690 
but he goes for the war predicting leave
see<00:02:37.500> which<00:02:37.650> was<00:02:37.800> a<00:02:37.890> really<00:02:38.250> really<00:02:38.400> good<00:02:38.550> play

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
see which was a really really good play

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.790 
see which was a really really good play
on<00:02:38.730> his<00:02:38.910> part<00:02:38.940> so<00:02:39.750> now<00:02:40.020> he's<00:02:40.350> I<00:02:40.500> mean<00:02:40.530> it

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
on his part so now he's I mean it

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.800 
on his part so now he's I mean it
Starmie<00:02:41.310> being<00:02:41.730> basically<00:02:42.000> dragged<00:02:42.360> out<00:02:42.570> and

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
Starmie being basically dragged out and

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.020 
Starmie being basically dragged out and
I<00:02:43.010> had<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.040> couple<00:02:44.250> options<00:02:44.459> here<00:02:44.730> I<00:02:44.819> could

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
I had a couple options here I could

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.310 
I had a couple options here I could
switch<00:02:45.239> doubt<00:02:45.450> but<00:02:45.600> I've<00:02:45.690> heard<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:46.110> roar

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
switch doubt but I've heard the roar

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.860 
switch doubt but I've heard the roar
again<00:02:46.470> because<00:02:47.459> starving<00:02:47.880> Swampert<00:02:48.690> really

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
again because starving Swampert really

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.990 
again because starving Swampert really
can't<00:02:49.050> do<00:02:49.170> anything<00:02:49.200> so<00:02:49.830> I'm<00:02:50.340> gonna<00:02:50.640> go<00:02:50.820> for<00:02:50.970> a

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
can't do anything so I'm gonna go for a

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.830 
can't do anything so I'm gonna go for a
high<00:02:51.120> jump<00:02:52.550> unfortunately<00:02:53.550> i<00:02:53.580> miss<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.239> i'm

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
high jump unfortunately i miss and i'm

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.720 
high jump unfortunately i miss and i'm
gonna<00:02:54.930> end<00:02:55.140> up<00:02:55.230> going<00:02:55.350> into<00:02:55.560> my<00:02:56.070> cell<00:02:56.370> be<00:02:56.580> in

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
gonna end up going into my cell be in

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.880 
gonna end up going into my cell be in
the<00:02:56.820> roar<00:02:57.030> hand<00:02:57.390> I<00:02:57.750> am<00:02:58.140> NOT<00:02:58.320> trying<00:02:58.500> thinking

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
the roar hand I am NOT trying thinking

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:59.930 
the roar hand I am NOT trying thinking
what<00:02:59.070> he's<00:02:59.220> going<00:02:59.430> to<00:02:59.459> do<00:02:59.580> he<00:02:59.730> asked<00:02:59.910> that

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
what he's going to do he asked that

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.240 
what he's going to do he asked that
lychee<00:03:00.180> I'm<00:03:00.420> so<00:03:00.989> I<00:03:01.019> think<00:03:01.110> okay<00:03:01.500> he's<00:03:01.920> going<00:03:02.160> to

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
lychee I'm so I think okay he's going to

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.380 
lychee I'm so I think okay he's going to
predict<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:02.550> energy<00:03:02.820> ball<00:03:02.970> so<00:03:03.090> this<00:03:03.209> is<00:03:03.300> the

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
predict the energy ball so this is the

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.300 
predict the energy ball so this is the
perfect<00:03:03.570> time<00:03:03.780> for<00:03:03.959> him<00:03:04.050> to<00:03:04.080> switch<00:03:04.410> so<00:03:05.130> I'm

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
perfect time for him to switch so I'm

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.340 
perfect time for him to switch so I'm
gonna<00:03:05.610> go<00:03:05.790> for<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.090> teeway<00:03:06.510> predicting<00:03:07.170> his

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
gonna go for the teeway predicting his
