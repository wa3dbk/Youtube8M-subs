00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
so here are the two figures and uh I

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.420 
so here are the two figures and uh I
believe<00:05:12.730> you<00:05:13.090> could<00:05:13.210> find<00:05:13.450> him<00:05:13.570> at<00:05:13.720> uh<00:05:14.430> yeah

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
believe you could find him at uh yeah

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.730 
believe you could find him at uh yeah
one<00:05:15.640> more<00:05:15.760> didn't<00:05:16.060> target<00:05:16.210> and<00:05:16.660> I<00:05:17.320> believe

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
one more didn't target and I believe

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.800 
one more didn't target and I believe
they're<00:05:17.980> about<00:05:18.310> what<00:05:19.140> 1599<00:05:21.720> somewhere<00:05:22.720> around

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
they're about what 1599 somewhere around

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:31.380 
they're about what 1599 somewhere around
there<00:05:24.330> yeah<00:05:28.140> these<00:05:29.140> two<00:05:29.470> are<00:05:29.500> a<00:05:29.980> must<00:05:30.430> for<00:05:30.910> any
