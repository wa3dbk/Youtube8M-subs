00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
okay got another video here ownio three

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.720 
okay got another video here ownio three
yz250<00:00:03.840> f<00:00:04.110> today<00:00:05.040> we're<00:00:05.130> gonna<00:00:05.220> be<00:00:05.370> taking<00:00:05.640> off

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
yz250 f today we're gonna be taking off

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.839 
yz250 f today we're gonna be taking off
the<00:00:05.819> stator<00:00:06.089> say<00:00:06.890> t30<00:00:09.110> torx<00:00:10.309> and<00:00:11.309> i<00:00:11.519> used<00:00:11.730> to

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
the stator say t30 torx and i used to

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.950 
the stator say t30 torx and i used to
have<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:13.130> actual<00:00:14.130> bit<00:00:14.400> i<00:00:14.670> can't<00:00:15.269> find<00:00:15.570> it<00:00:15.750> so<00:00:15.870> i'm

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
have a actual bit i can't find it so i'm

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.710 
have a actual bit i can't find it so i'm
using<00:00:16.139> this<00:00:16.350> set<00:00:16.650> that<00:00:16.680> i've<00:00:16.890> had<00:00:17.070> for<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.400> while

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
using this set that i've had for a while

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.660 
using this set that i've had for a while
here<00:00:19.460> there's<00:00:20.460> three<00:00:20.580> screws<00:00:22.250> pretty<00:00:23.250> simple

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
here there's three screws pretty simple

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.210 
here there's three screws pretty simple
once<00:00:23.850> you<00:00:23.910> get<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.180> fly<00:00:24.359> wall<00:00:24.570> off<00:00:24.750> it's<00:00:25.220> kind

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
once you get the fly wall off it's kind

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.429 
once you get the fly wall off it's kind
of<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.599> self-explanatory<00:00:27.599> it's<00:00:28.050> not<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.199> huge

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
of a self-explanatory it's not a huge

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:42.229 
of a self-explanatory it's not a huge
deal<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:37.610> take<00:00:38.610> those<00:00:38.730> three<00:00:39.030> bolts<00:00:39.329> off<00:00:41.239> this

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
deal and take those three bolts off this

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.330 
deal and take those three bolts off this
would<00:00:42.420> be<00:00:42.540> much<00:00:42.809> faster<00:00:43.079> if<00:00:43.440> i<00:00:43.680> had<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.040> actual

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
would be much faster if i had the actual

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.639 
would be much faster if i had the actual
bit

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
bit

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.290 
bit
she's<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.680> socket<00:00:48.110> already<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.140> ratchet<00:00:49.649> rather

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
she's a socket already a ratchet rather

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.189 
she's a socket already a ratchet rather
but<00:00:51.300> i<00:00:51.600> don't<00:00:52.079> know<00:00:52.170> where<00:00:52.320> it's<00:00:52.440> at<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:54.199> found

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
but i don't know where it's at so found

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.979 
but i don't know where it's at so found
my<00:00:55.350> larger<00:00:55.770> ones<00:00:55.949> but<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.610> didn't<00:00:56.879> find<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.120> t30

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.139 

up<00:01:01.399> then<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.520> see<00:01:02.670> this<00:01:02.760> little<00:01:03.000> rubber

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
up then you see this little rubber

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.050 
up then you see this little rubber
grommet<00:01:03.539> just<00:01:03.750> slide<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.170> out

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.060 
grommet just slide that out

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.429 
grommet just slide that out
there's<00:01:06.060> my<00:01:06.270> timing<00:01:06.630> chain<00:01:06.840> all<00:01:06.990> punched<00:01:07.320> up

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
there's my timing chain all punched up

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.399 
there's my timing chain all punched up
in<00:01:07.590> there<00:01:08.090> which<00:01:09.090> when<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.630> took<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.960> head<00:01:10.229> off

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
in there which when I took the head off

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.500 
in there which when I took the head off
I<00:01:10.680> just<00:01:10.770> let<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.100> fall<00:01:11.400> because<00:01:12.299> I'm<00:01:12.390> gonna

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
I just let it fall because I'm gonna

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.969 
I just let it fall because I'm gonna
replace<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.900> anyways<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.560> I'm<00:01:13.650> taking<00:01:13.890> off

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
replace it anyways and I'm taking off

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.749 
replace it anyways and I'm taking off
the<00:01:14.100> whole<00:01:14.250> motor<00:01:14.520> again<00:01:15.390> if<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.750> were<00:01:15.869> not

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
the whole motor again if you were not

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.050 
the whole motor again if you were not
going<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:19.070> replace<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.400> or<00:01:20.580> if<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.790> are<00:01:20.880> not

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
going to replace it or if you are not

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.660 
going to replace it or if you are not
going<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.540> take<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.229> head<00:01:22.380> off<00:01:22.530> when<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.549> do

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
going to take the head off when you do

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.429 
going to take the head off when you do
to<00:01:23.820> when<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.180> do<00:01:24.299> take<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.600> head<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.810> her<00:01:24.930> when

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
to when you do take the head of her when

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.170 
to when you do take the head of her when
you<00:01:25.530> do<00:01:26.250> take<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.520> head<00:01:26.640> off<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.909> would<00:01:27.030> want

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
you do take the head off you would want

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.539 
you do take the head off you would want
to<00:01:27.500> latch<00:01:28.500> this<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.950> side<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.520> doesn't

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
to latch this to the side so it doesn't

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.569 
to latch this to the side so it doesn't
fall<00:01:30.590> you<00:01:31.590> see<00:01:31.799> that's<00:01:31.950> where<00:01:32.070> your<00:01:32.220> keepers

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
fall you see that's where your keepers

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.569 
fall you see that's where your keepers
are<00:01:32.729> for<00:01:32.970> your<00:01:33.090> for<00:01:34.020> your<00:01:34.049> timing<00:01:34.409> change<00:01:34.619> so

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
are for your for your timing change so

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.460 
are for your for your timing change so
there<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.659> go<00:01:36.780> let's<00:01:37.020> just<00:01:37.079> have<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.380> take

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
there you go let's just have to take

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.100 
there you go let's just have to take
your<00:01:37.590> stator<00:01:37.860> off<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.340> then<00:01:38.750> we'll<00:01:39.750> move<00:01:39.900> on

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
your stator off and then we'll move on

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.990 
your stator off and then we'll move on
to<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.350> next<00:01:40.470> step<00:01:40.770> which<00:01:41.040> will<00:01:41.579> probably<00:01:41.790> be

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
to the next step which will probably be

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.210 
to the next step which will probably be
the<00:01:42.210> radiator<00:01:42.600> shroud<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.140> I'm<00:01:43.200> thinking<00:01:43.680> or

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
the radiator shroud so I'm thinking or

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.460 
the radiator shroud so I'm thinking or
the<00:01:44.460> chain<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.909> don't<00:01:45.149> know<00:01:45.270> we're<00:01:46.229> kind<00:01:46.439> of

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
the chain I don't know we're kind of

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.870 
the chain I don't know we're kind of
going<00:01:46.619> back<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:46.950> forth<00:01:47.310> here<00:01:47.460> in<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.640> few<00:01:47.790> of

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
going back and forth here in a few of

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.679 
going back and forth here in a few of
these<00:01:47.970> videos<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:49.520> anyway<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:50.579> feel<00:01:51.450> free<00:01:51.479> to
