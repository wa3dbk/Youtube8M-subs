00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
hey there my name is Tommy I'm the one

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:10.759 
hey there my name is Tommy I'm the one
who<00:00:02.370> had<00:00:03.330> the<00:00:03.600> katana<00:00:04.319> 750<00:00:06.049> mm<00:00:09.349> so<00:00:10.349> we<00:00:10.530> have<00:00:10.650> it

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
who had the katana 750 mm so we have it

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:11.780 
who had the katana 750 mm so we have it
all<00:00:10.860> taken<00:00:11.099> apart

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
all taken apart

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.089 
all taken apart
I<00:00:11.820> mean<00:00:12.300> somewhat<00:00:13.110> we<00:00:13.380> got<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.620> carbs<00:00:13.889> off

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
I mean somewhat we got the carbs off

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.200 
I mean somewhat we got the carbs off
just<00:00:15.059> so<00:00:15.210> we<00:00:15.240> could<00:00:15.570> loosen<00:00:15.900> up<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:17.210> chords

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
just so we could loosen up the chords

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.090 
just so we could loosen up the chords
going<00:00:18.930> up<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.380> switch<00:00:19.650> so<00:00:19.800> we<00:00:19.890> could<00:00:20.039> get

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
going up to the switch so we could get

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.300 
going up to the switch so we could get
the<00:00:20.250> switch<00:00:20.490> all<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.760> way<00:00:20.820> off<00:00:21.029> but<00:00:21.990> I<00:00:22.410> have

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
the switch all the way off but I have

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.509 
the switch all the way off but I have
this<00:00:23.550> booster<00:00:24.240> pack<00:00:24.480> on<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.840> battery<00:00:25.519> it's

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
this booster pack on the battery it's

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.720 
this booster pack on the battery it's
it's<00:00:27.000> off<00:00:27.210> our<00:00:27.630> notes<00:00:27.840> on<00:00:27.990> right<00:00:28.230> now<00:00:28.580> so<00:00:29.580> it's

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
it's off our notes on right now so it's

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.060 
it's off our notes on right now so it's
I<00:00:29.939> have<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.390> off<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:31.489> I<00:00:32.780> so<00:00:33.780> here's<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.290> key<00:00:34.530> it

I have it off and I so here's the key it

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.580 
I have it off and I so here's the key it
battery<00:00:35.700> doesn't<00:00:36.059> really<00:00:36.180> have<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.390> charge<00:00:36.690> but

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
battery doesn't really have a charge but

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.740 
battery doesn't really have a charge but
when<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.829> battery<00:00:38.100> does<00:00:38.309> it'll<00:00:38.670> turn<00:00:38.850> the

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
when the battery does it'll turn the

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.430 
when the battery does it'll turn the
lights<00:00:39.960> on<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.350> whatnot<00:00:40.760> and<00:00:41.930> so<00:00:43.579> with<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.700> off

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
lights on and whatnot and so with it off

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.160 
lights on and whatnot and so with it off
with<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.590> battery<00:00:46.950> or<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.640> booster<00:00:48.600> pack<00:00:48.930> off

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
with the battery or the booster pack off

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.560 
with the battery or the booster pack off
you<00:00:50.039> know<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.160> don't<00:00:50.399> have<00:00:50.430> enough<00:00:50.520> power<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:51.000> do

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
you know I don't have enough power to do

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.450 
you know I don't have enough power to do
this<00:00:51.780> but<00:00:52.399> when<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.430> do<00:00:55.070> the<00:00:56.070> lights<00:00:56.280> and

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
this but when I do the lights and

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.770 
this but when I do the lights and
everything<00:00:56.640> come<00:00:56.940> on<00:00:58.070> headlight<00:00:59.070> and<00:01:02.780> I'm

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
everything come on headlight and I'm

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.039 
everything come on headlight and I'm
pushing<00:01:04.170> start<00:01:05.010> button<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.580> mean<00:01:06.119> all<00:01:06.840> I'm

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
pushing start button I mean all I'm

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.420 
pushing start button I mean all I'm
trying<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.290> do<00:01:07.439> right<00:01:07.560> now<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.130> get<00:01:08.280> at

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
trying to do right now is to get at

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.929 
trying to do right now is to get at
least<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:09.860> turnover<00:01:10.860> or<00:01:11.130> something<00:01:11.520> some<00:01:11.790> type

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
least a turnover or something some type

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.780 
least a turnover or something some type
of<00:01:12.090> noise<00:01:12.240> but<00:01:13.100> this<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.250> where<00:01:14.400> we're<00:01:14.549> kind<00:01:14.670> of

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
of noise but this is where we're kind of

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.770 
of noise but this is where we're kind of
stuck<00:01:15.170> so<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:17.060> mean<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.180> battery<00:01:18.450> has<00:01:18.570> enough

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
stuck so I mean the battery has enough

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.620 
stuck so I mean the battery has enough
power<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.670> at<00:01:20.670> least<00:01:20.820> get<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.090> noise<00:01:21.330> out<00:01:21.600> of

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
power to at least get a noise out of

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.460 
power to at least get a noise out of
this<00:01:21.900> thing<00:01:22.220> we<00:01:23.220> have<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.520> pulled<00:01:23.700> apart<00:01:24.740> and

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
this thing we have it pulled apart and

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.020 
this thing we have it pulled apart and
we<00:01:28.470> checked<00:01:28.740> all<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.040> connections<00:01:29.520> inside<00:01:29.850> of

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
we checked all the connections inside of

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.050 
we checked all the connections inside of
it<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.740> from<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:32.520> know<00:01:32.579> we're<00:01:32.790> not<00:01:32.880> too

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
it and from you know we're not too

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.870 
it and from you know we're not too
experienced<00:01:33.600> so<00:01:33.810> from<00:01:34.140> what<00:01:34.259> we<00:01:34.380> can<00:01:34.530> tell

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
experienced so from what we can tell

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.940 
experienced so from what we can tell
they<00:01:35.880> all<00:01:36.030> looked<00:01:36.270> pretty<00:01:36.390> intact<00:01:36.960> pretty

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
they all looked pretty intact pretty

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:46.600 
they all looked pretty intact pretty
well<00:01:39.020> um<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.340> guess<00:01:41.340> yeah<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:45.320> there's<00:01:46.320> the

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
well um I guess yeah and there's the

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.899 
well um I guess yeah and there's the
it's<00:01:47.610> kind<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:47.880> focus<00:01:49.520> okay<00:01:50.520> it's<00:01:50.700> not<00:01:50.790> going

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
it's kind of focus okay it's not going

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.889 
it's kind of focus okay it's not going
to<00:01:51.000> focus<00:01:51.270> out<00:01:51.420> well<00:01:51.570> okay<00:01:52.229> there<00:01:52.380> we<00:01:52.470> go

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
to focus out well okay there we go

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.520 
to focus out well okay there we go
there's<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.549> start<00:01:56.549> button<00:01:56.850> push<00:01:57.409> and<00:01:58.409> that's

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
there's the start button push and that's

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.889 
there's the start button push and that's
you<00:01:59.460> know<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.640> seems<00:01:59.840> well<00:02:00.840> fastened<00:02:01.380> so

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
you know it seems well fastened so

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:04.850 
you know it seems well fastened so
somewhat<00:02:03.899> makes<00:02:04.110> me<00:02:04.259> believe<00:02:04.409> it's<00:02:04.710> not<00:02:04.770> the

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
somewhat makes me believe it's not the

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.880 
somewhat makes me believe it's not the
switch<00:02:05.570> but<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.810> know<00:02:06.930> I'm<00:02:07.049> not<00:02:07.200> experienced

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
switch but you know I'm not experienced

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.639 
switch but you know I'm not experienced
I'm<00:02:07.979> not<00:02:08.099> sure<00:02:08.369> if<00:02:08.550> I<00:02:09.200> missing<00:02:10.200> something<00:02:10.410> more

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
I'm not sure if I missing something more

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.160 
I'm not sure if I missing something more
somewhere<00:02:10.950> along<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.250> line<00:02:11.459> I<00:02:11.730> know<00:02:12.690> that<00:02:12.989> I'm

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
somewhere along the line I know that I'm

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.760 
somewhere along the line I know that I'm
supposed<00:02:13.319> to

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
supposed to

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.400 
supposed to
look<00:02:14.340> through<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:15.630> harness<00:02:15.840> to<00:02:16.170> see<00:02:16.350> if

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
look through the harness to see if

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.350 
look through the harness to see if
there's<00:02:16.590> a<00:02:16.650> break<00:02:17.010> in<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.250> wire<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.760> mean

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
there's a break in the wire I mean

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.880 
there's a break in the wire I mean
apparently<00:02:18.600> it's<00:02:18.960> getting<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.350> ignition<00:02:19.800> to

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
apparently it's getting the ignition to

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.540 
apparently it's getting the ignition to
turn<00:02:20.070> on<00:02:21.500> not<00:02:22.500> really<00:02:22.680> sure<00:02:22.980> where<00:02:23.220> else<00:02:23.400> to

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
turn on not really sure where else to

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.090 
turn on not really sure where else to
check<00:02:23.790> I've<00:02:24.060> traced<00:02:24.660> back<00:02:24.960> as<00:02:25.260> much<00:02:25.500> wires<00:02:25.800> as

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
check I've traced back as much wires as

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.160 
check I've traced back as much wires as
possible<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:27.360> know<00:02:27.450> me<00:02:27.600> and<00:02:27.720> my<00:02:27.780> friend<00:02:28.050> went

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
possible you know me and my friend went

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.750 
possible you know me and my friend went
all<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.380> way<00:02:28.470> through<00:02:28.800> and<00:02:29.070> we<00:02:29.100> couldn't<00:02:29.550> seem

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
all the way through and we couldn't seem

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:36.230 
all the way through and we couldn't seem
to<00:02:29.850> find<00:02:29.910> any<00:02:30.270> breaks<00:02:30.600> in<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.780> wire<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:35.240> the

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
to find any breaks in the wire and the

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:42.650 
to find any breaks in the wire and the
fuses<00:02:36.630> all<00:02:36.750> seem<00:02:36.990> to<00:02:37.020> be<00:02:37.170> good<00:02:41.660> what

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
fuses all seem to be good what

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.360 
fuses all seem to be good what
originally<00:02:42.870> happened<00:02:43.110> was<00:02:43.710> we<00:02:43.980> bought<00:02:44.190> the

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
got to the gas station and he had to

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.740 
got to the gas station and he had to
turn<00:03:00.780> off<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.960> bike<00:03:01.110> to<00:03:01.260> put<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.500> gas<00:03:01.680> in<00:03:01.980> and

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.420 
we put the we put the high premium gas
in<00:03:11.940> which<00:03:12.660> after<00:03:13.170> watching<00:03:13.650> your<00:03:13.770> channel<00:03:13.920> is

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
in which after watching your channel is

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.790 
in which after watching your channel is
probably<00:03:14.760> not<00:03:14.880> a<00:03:14.910> good<00:03:15.120> you<00:03:15.900> know<00:03:15.990> you<00:03:16.590> don't

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
probably not a good you know you don't

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:25.970 
probably not a good you know you don't
have<00:03:16.950> to<00:03:17.240> and<00:03:19.340> we<00:03:21.890> went<00:03:22.890> to<00:03:24.050> no<00:03:25.050> we<00:03:25.650> went<00:03:25.800> to<00:03:25.890> go

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
have to and we went to no we went to go

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.070 
have to and we went to no we went to go
start<00:03:26.310> it<00:03:26.370> up<00:03:26.490> after<00:03:26.760> we<00:03:26.850> got<00:03:26.940> the<00:03:27.060> gas<00:03:27.240> in<00:03:27.510> it

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
start it up after we got the gas in it

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.650 
start it up after we got the gas in it
wouldn't<00:03:28.350> start<00:03:28.590> so<00:03:29.060> we<00:03:30.060> tried<00:03:30.210> to<00:03:30.240> push<00:03:30.450> start

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
wouldn't start so we tried to push start

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.300 
wouldn't start so we tried to push start
it<00:03:30.840> took<00:03:31.050> a<00:03:31.080> while<00:03:31.290> so<00:03:31.590> we<00:03:31.740> finally<00:03:32.040> found<00:03:32.160> a

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
it took a while so we finally found a

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.850 
it took a while so we finally found a
guy<00:03:32.430> got<00:03:32.790> a<00:03:32.820> jump<00:03:33.180> to<00:03:33.360> start<00:03:33.810> a<00:03:33.870> find<00:03:34.080> and<00:03:34.770> we

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
guy got a jump to start a find and we

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.700 
guy got a jump to start a find and we
started<00:03:35.190> getting<00:03:35.280> along<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:35.850> road<00:03:36.060> and<00:03:36.710> after

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:37.710 
started getting along the road and after

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.950 
started getting along the road and after
a<00:03:37.770> while<00:03:37.950> it<00:03:38.280> started<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:39.270> oil<00:03:39.450> like<00:03:39.630> kept

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:39.960 
a while it started the oil like kept

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:45.200 
a while it started the oil like kept
flashing<00:03:40.830> on<00:03:41.630> like<00:03:42.630> right<00:03:42.780> there<00:03:43.050> and<00:03:43.970> he<00:03:44.970> kept

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:45.210 
flashing on like right there and he kept

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.180 
flashing on like right there and he kept
flashing<00:03:45.630> while<00:03:46.050> we<00:03:46.140> were<00:03:46.230> driving<00:03:46.680> we<00:03:46.980> tried

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
flashing while we were driving we tried

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.950 
flashing while we were driving we tried
to<00:03:47.310> we<00:03:47.550> all<00:03:47.790> went<00:03:48.060> up<00:03:48.150> on<00:03:48.300> motorcycles

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:48.960 
to we all went up on motorcycles

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.020 
to we all went up on motorcycles
probably<00:03:49.860> not<00:03:49.980> the<00:03:50.070> best<00:03:50.100> idea<00:03:50.430> but<00:03:52.730> he<00:03:53.730> got<00:03:53.910> it

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
probably not the best idea but he got it

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.310 
probably not the best idea but he got it
most<00:03:54.210> of<00:03:54.330> the<00:03:54.390> way<00:03:54.510> home<00:03:54.720> and<00:03:54.930> then<00:03:55.020> stopped

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
most of the way home and then stopped

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.900 
most of the way home and then stopped
off<00:03:55.470> at<00:03:55.650> his<00:03:55.770> work<00:03:55.980> and<00:03:56.250> turned<00:03:56.460> it<00:03:56.580> off<00:03:56.700> and

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
off at his work and turned it off and

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.400 
off at his work and turned it off and
wasn't<00:03:57.210> able<00:03:57.300> to<00:03:57.450> get<00:03:57.570> it<00:03:57.690> going<00:03:57.960> again<00:03:58.050> we

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
wasn't able to get it going again we

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.020 
wasn't able to get it going again we
eventually<00:03:58.890> you<00:03:59.100> know<00:03:59.220> went<00:03:59.460> and<00:03:59.670> grabbed<00:03:59.910> it

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
eventually you know went and grabbed it

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:06.830 
eventually you know went and grabbed it
with<00:04:00.150> truck<00:04:01.140> and<00:04:01.730> got<00:04:02.730> it<00:04:02.880> back<00:04:03.030> here<00:04:03.800> and<00:04:05.840> ever

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
with truck and got it back here and ever

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.300 
with truck and got it back here and ever
since<00:04:07.110> then<00:04:07.350> we<00:04:07.530> haven't<00:04:07.680> been<00:04:07.860> able<00:04:07.980> to<00:04:08.100> do

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
since then we haven't been able to do

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.460 
since then we haven't been able to do
much<00:04:08.460> I<00:04:08.820> mean<00:04:09.510> apparently<00:04:09.990> there's<00:04:10.410> an

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
much I mean apparently there's an

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.560 
much I mean apparently there's an
electrical<00:04:10.860> issue<00:04:11.040> I<00:04:11.430> know<00:04:12.120> there's<00:04:12.390> probably

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
electrical issue I know there's probably

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.270 
electrical issue I know there's probably
more<00:04:12.900> but<00:04:13.140> I'm<00:04:13.230> at<00:04:13.350> least<00:04:13.500> trying<00:04:13.620> to<00:04:13.830> get<00:04:14.040> some

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
more but I'm at least trying to get some

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.110 
more but I'm at least trying to get some
type<00:04:14.490> of<00:04:15.830> start<00:04:16.830> so<00:04:17.070> I<00:04:17.100> can<00:04:17.340> at<00:04:17.460> least<00:04:17.549> diagnose

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
type of start so I can at least diagnose

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.470 
type of start so I can at least diagnose
the<00:04:18.299> other<00:04:18.450> problems<00:04:19.850> but<00:04:20.850> if<00:04:21.180> there's

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
the other problems but if there's

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.670 
the other problems but if there's
something<00:04:21.720> I<00:04:21.780> missed<00:04:21.840> and<00:04:22.470> you<00:04:22.530> can<00:04:22.910> you<00:04:23.910> know

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
something I missed and you can you know

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.429 
something I missed and you can you know
refresh<00:04:25.680> my<00:04:25.890> mind<00:04:26.460> on

00:04:27.429 --> 00:04:27.439 
refresh my mind on

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:30.469 
refresh my mind on
make<00:04:28.439> me<00:04:28.560> look<00:04:28.680> over<00:04:29.009> like<00:04:29.340> I<00:04:29.580> know<00:04:29.639> the

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 
make me look over like I know the

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:32.240 
make me look over like I know the
kickstand<00:04:30.960> has<00:04:31.229> been<00:04:31.439> known<00:04:31.620> to<00:04:31.800> give<00:04:32.039> some

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
kickstand has been known to give some

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.200 
kickstand has been known to give some
issues<00:04:32.729> every<00:04:33.719> now<00:04:33.870> and<00:04:34.050> then<00:04:34.169> but<00:04:34.939> it<00:04:35.939> seems

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
issues every now and then but it seems

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.540 
issues every now and then but it seems
to<00:04:36.360> be<00:04:36.419> a<00:04:36.509> little<00:04:36.689> pinched<00:04:37.259> I<00:04:37.530> can't<00:04:38.430> really

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
to be a little pinched I can't really

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.339 
to be a little pinched I can't really
get<00:04:38.789> a<00:04:38.819> good<00:04:39.030> view<00:04:39.360> with<00:04:39.509> the<00:04:39.629> light<00:04:39.810> but<00:04:40.139> I

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:40.349 
get a good view with the light but I

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:42.939 
get a good view with the light but I
mean<00:04:40.949> it's<00:04:41.159> not<00:04:41.310> really<00:04:41.699> that<00:04:41.729> bad<00:04:42.150> pinched

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:42.949 
mean it's not really that bad pinched

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:46.790 
mean it's not really that bad pinched
and<00:04:43.949> it's<00:04:44.189> going<00:04:44.460> up<00:04:45.110> here<00:04:46.110> all<00:04:46.439> the<00:04:46.620> wires

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
and it's going up here all the wires

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.129 
and it's going up here all the wires
seem<00:04:47.069> to<00:04:47.219> it<00:04:47.340> be<00:04:48.150> attached<00:04:48.750> really<00:04:49.199> well<00:04:49.909> and

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
seem to it be attached really well and

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:53.600 
seem to it be attached really well and
we<00:04:52.139> played<00:04:52.469> with<00:04:52.500> the<00:04:52.680> solenoid<00:04:53.129> we<00:04:53.340> actually

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
we played with the solenoid we actually

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.260 
we played with the solenoid we actually
got<00:04:53.729> it<00:04:53.909> to<00:04:54.030> like<00:04:54.650> when<00:04:55.650> we<00:04:55.770> bridged<00:04:56.069> it<00:04:56.370> we

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
got it to like when we bridged it we

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.969 
got it to like when we bridged it we
were<00:04:57.419> able<00:04:57.569> to<00:04:58.039> actually<00:05:00.229> get<00:05:01.229> it<00:05:01.409> kicking<00:05:01.860> a

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
were able to actually get it kicking a

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:08.029 
were able to actually get it kicking a
little<00:05:02.219> bit<00:05:02.400> but<00:05:04.069> um<00:05:05.069> I<00:05:05.159> have<00:05:05.669> a<00:05:05.699> volt<00:05:06.060> meter<00:05:07.039> so

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 
little bit but um I have a volt meter so

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:11.719 
little bit but um I have a volt meter so
I<00:05:08.840> just<00:05:09.840> I'm<00:05:10.199> not<00:05:10.409> sure<00:05:10.680> exactly<00:05:11.069> if<00:05:11.310> I<00:05:11.669> know

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:11.729 
I just I'm not sure exactly if I know

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:14.600 
I just I'm not sure exactly if I know
what<00:05:11.969> I'm<00:05:12.060> looking<00:05:12.389> for<00:05:12.629> we<00:05:13.039> we<00:05:14.039> get<00:05:14.250> power

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
what I'm looking for we we get power

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.269 
what I'm looking for we we get power
going<00:05:14.969> to<00:05:15.300> these<00:05:15.509> where<00:05:16.259> the<00:05:16.590> chords<00:05:16.919> come<00:05:17.069> in

00:05:17.269 --> 00:05:17.279 
going to these where the chords come in

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:20.570 
going to these where the chords come in
on<00:05:17.759> to<00:05:18.180> the<00:05:18.330> sorry<00:05:19.139> I<00:05:19.379> think<00:05:19.979> you<00:05:20.250> can't<00:05:20.490> even

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
on to the sorry I think you can't even

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.249 
on to the sorry I think you can't even
see<00:05:20.759> it<00:05:20.990> on<00:05:21.990> the<00:05:22.409> screws<00:05:22.740> for<00:05:23.310> each<00:05:23.430> one<00:05:23.669> and<00:05:24.259> we

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:25.259 
see it on the screws for each one and we

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:28.490 
see it on the screws for each one and we
pulled<00:05:25.469> this<00:05:25.620> off<00:05:25.919> the<00:05:26.279> pin
