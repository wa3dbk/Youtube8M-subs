00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.990
 yes hello people and welcome to this 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.500
 small video in today's video is 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.540
 around the nzxt phantom 14 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.770
 that is, of course, is the small one 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:20.760
 brother who is 630 yes it is midi tower 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:24.180
 and first of all to the dimensions yes only 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:28.830
 in the dimensions of the fendt in 410 amount 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:31.289
 in width 21 5 cm in height 52 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:36.540
 centimeters and in depth so after 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:38.879
 behind of course 53 2 centimeters yes around 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.219
 to make a picture how big because 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.950
 this housing is there was on the 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.469
 video by the dimensions that not so 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.899
 I can say exactly 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.949
 so is always quite useful that ma 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.260
 to show against the site housing and 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.879
 i also have a star right now 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.969
 that means I'll show it to you now 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.120
 compared to a commercially available standard 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.120
 casing 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:30.200
 yes now see their fenton 410 against 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:36.710
 standard housing again looks like this 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:40.369
 of course not on the video like that 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.800
 clearly as in real but it is 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.810
 really really a blatant 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:51.800
 It both distinguished a midi tower 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:53.539
 housing is the remote 419 yes now to 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.820
 interior of the housing so what we as 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:58.670
 first look at it is 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.610
 integrated fan at the rear end of the 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.440
 housing, and of course he is like 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.320
 this one up here and this one from here 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.050
 in the housing already integrated if 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.360
 you buy it and yes just to the dimensions 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:18.530
 So the fan is here 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:22.160
 a 120 millimeter nzxt lifter up here 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:26.019
 There is a 140 mm nzxt ventilate and 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.850
 here in front of 120 millimeter nzxt fan 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:32.200
 There we go again I'm coming 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.670
 faster on 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.390
 Of course we have the possibility here 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.160
 another 140 millimeter fan 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.030
 integrate 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.680
 just like you below but I suspect 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.459
 that is 920 mm 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.340
 Here we can 120 then reinbauen yet 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:56.030
 in addition and yes you already see here 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.880
 is not a graphics card in there I just 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:03.470
 make a video card test yes and 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:08.269
 although about the hd 7770 of powercolor and 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:10.579
 about the hd 7750 from hs yes now again 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.269
 to the actual piece and that to the 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:14.060
 casing 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.670
 yes why a recording with the coffee 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.790
 It can be very simple and a lot 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:23.959
 good gadget the housing is that one 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:27.230
 remove the hard drive cage 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.310
 so you have a longer graphics card next to it 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.280
 can build up 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.870
 and yes because that just not a hindrance 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.989
 obstacle is 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:40.040
 this cage of trends just for longer 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:42.590
 graphics cards why me to the next 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.110
 has decided for the housing is the 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.819
 integrated fan control so that you 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.280
 fans in three different stages 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:54.110
 can regulate just and quite normal 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:57.500
 low medium and fast yes then have 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:00.409
 We casing on itself again a 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.769
 headphones input microphone input two 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:07.370
 USB 2.0 2 USB 3.0 which I very 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:11.420
 then liked the button and the 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:14.239
 reset button above the 140 mm fan 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.729
 there is still no one in there from home 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.910
 Here you can, for example, the 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:21.799
 lay water cooling 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.440
 and yes then I show that again 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:29.150
 see housing from all sides so here 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:34.310
 from form here again briefly to 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:36.889
 shut up here is still a cover 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:40.400
 or is there a flap there 100 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:43.700
 could one integrate cd drives or 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:48.320
 for example, I now have a card reader 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:50.720
 and yes he has usb 2.0 and here again 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.760
 other things I do in another 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.830
 video already mentioned here you can see 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:05:00.740
 also the lettering nzxt phantom 14 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:06.039
 and now around the housing here we see from 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:06.039
 that would be from behind 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:17.620
 itself as from behind yes and from the 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.520
 I'll show you the other side right away 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:23.680
 Show you the same and then until then 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:27.670
 yes now to this page here we can 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.700
 remove two screws again and 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:33.040
 then see the cable management underneath 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:41.110
 which one can travel very well through this 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:43.540
 Laying through it looks like that 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:47.710
 must be seen from the other now of 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:50.520
 here through the passages perfect the 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.520
 laid cable 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:59.200
 that's what it was now 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:02.710
 to the small review on the nzxt 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:04.810
 phantom 410 I hope you have it 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.830
 and of course he will pass me over 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.120
 a thumbs up 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:11.070
 and subscribe to that, of course 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.070
 from jazz to friends next time
