00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
the first thing that you want to do is

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.139 
the first thing that you want to do is
kind<00:01:14.409> of<00:01:14.529> get<00:01:14.679> the<00:01:14.829> core<00:01:15.100> out<00:01:15.340> of<00:01:15.399> there<00:01:15.759> so<00:01:15.969> we

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149 
kind of get the core out of there so we

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:19.580 
kind of get the core out of there so we
are<00:01:16.420> just<00:01:16.689> going<00:01:16.899> to<00:01:17.219> cut<00:01:18.219> around<00:01:18.369> the<00:01:18.880> center

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
are just going to cut around the center

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.309 
are just going to cut around the center
and<00:01:20.819> discard<00:01:21.819> the<00:01:21.969> center<00:01:22.299> because<00:01:22.689> that's

00:01:23.309 --> 00:01:23.319 
and discard the center because that's

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:24.690 
and discard the center because that's
where<00:01:23.439> the<00:01:23.529> core<00:01:23.770> is<00:01:23.950> so<00:01:24.159> it's<00:01:24.310> a<00:01:24.369> little<00:01:24.520> bit

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
where the core is so it's a little bit

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.760 
where the core is so it's a little bit
tougher<00:01:25.090> so<00:01:25.869> we're<00:01:25.990> not<00:01:26.079> going<00:01:26.259> to<00:01:26.349> use<00:01:26.499> those

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
tougher so we're not going to use those

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.129 
tougher so we're not going to use those

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:35.639 
then I'm just doing three cuts
around<00:01:32.469> the<00:01:32.560> core<00:01:33.779> okay<00:01:34.779> so<00:01:34.990> once<00:01:35.409> we<00:01:35.529> get

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
around the core okay so once we get

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:37.559
