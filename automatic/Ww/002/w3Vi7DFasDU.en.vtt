 dimensions you can see that they are not 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.950
 excessive 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:24.590
 this is a blackberry z-30 with screen 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:28.070
 5 inches

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.690
 blackberry device with system 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.950
 operative blackberry 10 and it is also

 also has a charge in two hours 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.790
 the sbs piper portugal speaker can be 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.070
 use as a speakerphone although it's not 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.860
 a function that I have precisely 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:11.690
 left very happy is not one of the 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:15.229
 strong points of this accessory the sbs 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:18.410
 paper portable speaker has about 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:22.640
 good finishes where we will find 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:26.090
 a body where plastic is mixed and 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:29.210
 metal components which is something 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.700
 very positive in my opinion 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.000
 let's look at design or what 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.799
 we can find we have these 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.880
 little buttons here that will serve us 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:43.490
 to move between the tracks and also 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.190
 to increase or decrease the volume of 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.800
 In addition, the sound will also be useful 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.710
 central button to pause and resume 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.470
 the reproduction or to even answer 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.990
 calls 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.810
 we will find the microphone for brothers 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.930
 free 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.560
 we have a mini usb connection to be able 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:07.289
 charge the speaker and then we will have a 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.409
 mechanism to activate the 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:09.409
 bluetooth 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.800
 and therefore to be able to match the 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.380
 speaker with the electronic device or 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.730
 our tablet or player smartphone 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.280
 music with bluetooth 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.159
 so the piper for all the 'speaker' 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.920
 can be used autonomously with 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:31.590
 a memory card or next to 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.640
 our electronic device with 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.640
 bluetooth technology 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.730
 at the base what we have is a finish 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.980
 with a high level of friction so that 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.200
 we have it on a surface and not 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.319
 move even we could have it in 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.709
 a slightly sloping surface and 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:56.430
 the speaker would not move through that 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:03:00.000
 table or for that particular moment 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.970
 that's a plus point in terms of 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.450
 design 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:08.030
 a device that weighs 230 grams and 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.260
 that shows that it's not just plastic 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.850
 but we find metallic elements 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:18.050
 all this area here would be metallic 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:20.600
 also this area here would be with 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.820
 metallic finish that's something that to me 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.960
 I particularly like the product 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.960
 not plastic 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:31.310
 sound quality I said 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:36.139
 previously the truth is that with my z 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:39.230
 30 the sbs piper port of the speaker has 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:42.230
 left very but very satisfied has 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:45.049
 surprised the performance of those 3 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.599
 watts of maximum power was 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:50.540
 using two days and not just in one 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:52.599
 small room but in a living room 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.519
 15 square meters 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:57.829
 obviously does not have a base 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:01.060
 incredible to be able to appreciate those 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:04.790
 sounds more serious but the truth is that 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:08.689
 the balance between acute treble means 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:13.099
 and serious is very satisfying so 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:16.220
 I 'm sbs piper for all the speaker 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:20.030
 it would be one of the recommended accessories 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:25.539
 for both a blackberry phone and 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.539
 for an android smartphone or bye
