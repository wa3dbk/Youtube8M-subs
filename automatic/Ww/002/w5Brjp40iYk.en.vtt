I think it's fun it's day one so I think

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.229 
I think it's fun it's day one so I think
any<00:00:36.630> call<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:37.079> duty<00:00:37.350> at<00:00:37.770> this<00:00:38.070> point<00:00:38.340> would<00:00:39.059> be

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
any call of duty at this point would be

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.030 
any call of duty at this point would be
fun<00:00:39.450> Call<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.690> Duty<00:00:39.960> ghosts<00:00:40.170> was<00:00:40.469> fun<00:00:40.649> at<00:00:40.860> this

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
fun Call of Duty ghosts was fun at this

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.990 
fun Call of Duty ghosts was fun at this
point<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:42.210> can<00:00:42.469> safely<00:00:43.469> say<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:44.070> this

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
point and I can safely say that this

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.209 
point and I can safely say that this
game<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.539> better<00:00:45.870> than<00:00:46.020> Call<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.410> Duty<00:00:46.860> ghosts

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
game is better than Call of Duty ghosts

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.240 
game is better than Call of Duty ghosts
and<00:00:47.340> that's<00:00:47.489> not<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.910> hard<00:00:48.510> thing<00:00:48.750> to

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
and that's not a hard thing to

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.490 
and that's not a hard thing to
accomplish<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.750> some<00:00:51.750> things<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.170> like

the<00:04:06.150> ground<00:04:06.600> stomp<00:04:07.290> thing<00:04:07.910> when<00:04:08.910> you<00:04:09.030> go<00:04:09.270> the

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
the ground stomp thing when you go the

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.720 
the ground stomp thing when you go the
death<00:04:09.930> from<00:04:10.080> above<00:04:10.440> I<00:04:10.590> get<00:04:10.740> a<00:04:10.770> kill<00:04:10.980> later<00:04:11.550> in

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
death from above I get a kill later in

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.520 
death from above I get a kill later in
this<00:04:11.850> gameplay<00:04:12.090> it's<00:04:12.330> very<00:04:12.570> difficult<00:04:12.900> to<00:04:13.380> get

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
this gameplay it's very difficult to get

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
this gameplay it's very difficult to get
by<00:04:13.650> very<00:04:13.860> satisfying

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
by very satisfying

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.640 
by very satisfying
I<00:04:14.580> like<00:04:14.970> the<00:04:15.120> score<00:04:15.360> streaks<00:04:15.690> and<00:04:15.900> I<00:04:16.230> really

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
I like the score streaks and I really

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.520 
I like the score streaks and I really
like<00:04:16.859> that<00:04:17.520> you<00:04:17.910> can<00:04:18.120> customize<00:04:18.390> your<00:04:19.260> score

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
like that you can customize your score

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.130 
like that you can customize your score
streaks<00:04:19.890> at<00:04:20.280> the<00:04:20.730> expense<00:04:21.299> of<00:04:21.450> they're<00:04:22.109> a

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
streaks at the expense of they're a

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.500 
streaks at the expense of they're a
little<00:04:22.350> bit<00:04:22.530> more<00:04:22.770> expensive<00:04:23.130> now<00:04:23.640> I<00:04:23.940> don't

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
little bit more expensive now I don't

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.080 
little bit more expensive now I don't
know<00:04:24.650> necessarily<00:04:25.650> if<00:04:26.340> they<00:04:26.520> did<00:04:26.669> the<00:04:26.790> best

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
know necessarily if they did the best

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.450 
know necessarily if they did the best
job<00:04:27.300> balancing<00:04:27.780> the<00:04:28.500> scorestreaks<00:04:29.070> was<00:04:29.310> that

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
job balancing the scorestreaks was that

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.670 
job balancing the scorestreaks was that
just<00:04:29.669> a<00:04:29.760> meteor<00:04:30.030> to<00:04:30.360> the<00:04:30.720> flew<00:04:31.139> across<00:04:31.230> the<00:04:31.440> map

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
just a meteor to the flew across the map

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.310 
just a meteor to the flew across the map
I<00:04:31.889> don't<00:04:32.460> know<00:04:32.550> if<00:04:32.639> they<00:04:32.760> did<00:04:32.910> the<00:04:33.000> best<00:04:33.180> job

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
I don't know if they did the best job

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.540 
I don't know if they did the best job
balancing<00:04:34.320> the<00:04:34.440> scorestreaks<00:04:34.919> in<00:04:35.070> terms<00:04:35.310> of

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
balancing the scorestreaks in terms of

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.000 
balancing the scorestreaks in terms of
how<00:04:35.790> much<00:04:35.970> it<00:04:36.210> costs<00:04:36.570> to<00:04:36.630> get<00:04:36.930> i<00:04:37.139> believe<00:04:37.740> i<00:04:37.889> was

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
how much it costs to get i believe i was

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.409 
how much it costs to get i believe i was
watching<00:04:38.190> along<00:04:38.490> as<00:04:38.580> a<00:04:38.639> redemption<00:04:39.090> and<00:04:39.300> he

the<00:05:05.100> invisibility<00:05:05.610> could<00:05:06.300> come<00:05:06.600> in<00:05:06.750> handy<00:05:06.930> a

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
the invisibility could come in handy a

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.140

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
it adds another element to the game as

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.710 
it adds another element to the game as

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
like how you can customize your

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.920 
like how you can customize your
scorestreaks<00:05:30.150> so<00:05:30.270> if<00:05:30.330> you<00:05:30.419> guys<00:05:30.510> don't<00:05:30.750> know

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
scorestreaks so if you guys don't know

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.050 
scorestreaks so if you guys don't know
you<00:05:31.380> can<00:05:31.560> upgrade<00:05:31.770> your<00:05:32.010> scorestreaks<00:05:32.700> for

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
you can upgrade your scorestreaks for

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.170 
you can upgrade your scorestreaks for
example<00:05:33.510> you<00:05:33.810> can<00:05:33.930> upgrade<00:05:34.110> the<00:05:34.410> UAV<00:05:34.800> to<00:05:35.400> be<00:05:35.940> a

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
example you can upgrade the UAV to be a

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.659 
example you can upgrade the UAV to be a
counter<00:05:36.510> UAV<00:05:36.660> but<00:05:37.320> it's<00:05:37.470> got<00:05:37.620> a<00:05:37.650> I<00:05:37.979> think<00:05:38.520> go

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669 
counter UAV but it's got a I think go

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:41.900 
counter UAV but it's got a I think go
from<00:05:38.910> 400<00:05:39.270> scorestreak<00:05:40.229> to<00:05:40.860> like<00:05:41.550> 600

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
from 400 scorestreak to like 600

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.339 
from 400 scorestreak to like 600
scorestreak<00:05:42.539> for<00:05:42.690> that<00:05:42.780> something<00:05:43.139> along

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:43.349 
scorestreak for that something along

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:44.690 
scorestreak for that something along
those<00:05:43.530> lines<00:05:43.680> we<00:05:43.979> got<00:05:44.099> a<00:05:44.130> really<00:05:44.370> close<00:05:44.520> game

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700 
those lines we got a really close game

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.330 
those lines we got a really close game
by<00:05:44.880> the<00:05:44.940> way<00:05:45.000> 41<00:05:45.599> of<00:05:45.800> 45<00:05:46.800> we<00:05:46.979> just<00:05:47.130> kind<00:05:47.280> of

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
by the way 41 of 45 we just kind of

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.710 
by the way 41 of 45 we just kind of
pulled<00:05:47.550> away<00:05:47.639> a<00:05:47.789> little<00:05:48.090> bit<00:05:48.210> here<00:05:48.450> as<00:05:48.570> i

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
pulled away a little bit here as i

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.279 
pulled away a little bit here as i
mentioned<00:05:49.139> it<00:05:49.970> well<00:05:50.970> yeah<00:05:51.090> I<00:05:51.120> like<00:05:51.840> boosted

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:52.289 
mentioned it well yeah I like boosted

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:54.920 
mentioned it well yeah I like boosted
and<00:05:52.410> round<00:05:52.620> it's<00:05:52.979> it's<00:05:53.760> fun<00:05:54.030> and<00:05:54.240> it<00:05:54.389> adds<00:05:54.630> like

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
and round it's it's fun and it adds like

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.320 
and round it's it's fun and it adds like
another<00:05:55.440> element<00:05:55.950> to<00:05:56.070> Call<00:05:56.639> of<00:05:56.669> Duty<00:05:57.120> that

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
another element to Call of Duty that

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.960 
another element to Call of Duty that
wasn't<00:05:58.260> there<00:05:58.410> before<00:05:58.440> it's<00:05:59.220> multiple<00:05:59.669> levels

00:05:59.960 --> 00:05:59.970 
wasn't there before it's multiple levels

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.629 
wasn't there before it's multiple levels
now<00:06:00.180> with<00:06:00.630> you<00:06:01.080> know<00:06:01.110> the<00:06:01.530> the<00:06:01.919> boost<00:06:02.160> jumping

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 
now with you know the the boost jumping

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:04.790 
now with you know the the boost jumping
so<00:06:02.849> the<00:06:02.970> maps<00:06:03.210> aren't<00:06:03.900> bigger

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
so the maps aren't bigger

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.710 
so the maps aren't bigger
I<00:06:04.950> think<00:06:05.220> the<00:06:05.280> maps<00:06:05.490> are<00:06:05.610> good<00:06:05.820> the<00:06:06.479> maps

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 
I think the maps are good the maps

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.320 
I think the maps are good the maps
aren't<00:06:07.080> bigger<00:06:07.500> than<00:06:07.830> other<00:06:08.639> Call<00:06:08.970> of<00:06:09.000> Duty

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
aren't bigger than other Call of Duty

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.420 
aren't bigger than other Call of Duty
games<00:06:09.510> but<00:06:10.349> they<00:06:10.500> are<00:06:10.530> in<00:06:10.950> terms<00:06:11.160> of<00:06:11.370> like

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
games but they are in terms of like

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.510 
games but they are in terms of like
total<00:06:12.210> surface<00:06:12.450> area<00:06:12.810> because<00:06:13.370> instead<00:06:14.370> of

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 
total surface area because instead of

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.480 
total surface area because instead of
having<00:06:15.000> a<00:06:15.330> Call<00:06:15.570> of<00:06:15.599> Duty<00:06:15.960> map<00:06:16.110> beyond<00:06:16.889> only

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490 
having a Call of Duty map beyond only

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.839 
having a Call of Duty map beyond only
two<00:06:17.820> levels<00:06:18.060> now<00:06:18.830> they're<00:06:19.830> on<00:06:20.070> three<00:06:20.460> the<00:06:20.610> four

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:20.849 
two levels now they're on three the four

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:22.430 
two levels now they're on three the four
levels<00:06:21.180> and<00:06:21.330> there's<00:06:21.539> just<00:06:21.720> more<00:06:21.900> places

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 
levels and there's just more places

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.409 
levels and there's just more places
where<00:06:22.620> people<00:06:22.919> can<00:06:23.099> camp<00:06:23.639> and<00:06:23.880> people<00:06:24.150> can<00:06:24.270> be

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:24.419 
where people can camp and people can be
