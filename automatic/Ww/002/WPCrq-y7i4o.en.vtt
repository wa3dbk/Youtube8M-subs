it's got the same style knotch goes on

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.870 
it's got the same style knotch goes on
one<00:01:56.030> way<00:01:57.039> and<00:01:58.039> you<00:01:58.130> notice<00:01:58.399> when<00:01:58.549> you<00:01:58.579> pull<00:01:58.759> the

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
one way and you notice when you pull the

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.980 
one way and you notice when you pull the
lever<00:01:58.909> out<00:01:59.210> there's<00:01:59.420> this<00:01:59.539> little<00:01:59.780> spring

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
lever out there's this little spring

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.050 
lever out there's this little spring
this<00:02:00.740> little<00:02:00.979> spring<00:02:01.159> will<00:02:01.369> actually<00:02:01.700> rework

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
this little spring will actually rework

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.580 
this little spring will actually rework
on<00:02:02.329> the<00:02:02.479> new<00:02:02.600> one<00:02:02.749> this<00:02:02.899> basically<00:02:03.200> goes<00:02:03.409> on

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
on the new one this basically goes on

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.779 
on the new one this basically goes on
the<00:02:03.679> underside<00:02:04.070> of<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.249> lever<00:02:04.399> so<00:02:04.609> you<00:02:04.700> can

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
the underside of the lever so you can

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:06.279 
the underside of the lever so you can
pull<00:02:04.969> this<00:02:05.090> out<00:02:05.240> and<00:02:05.450> it<00:02:05.570> fits<00:02:05.810> in<00:02:05.929> a<00:02:06.049> notch

pull this out and it fits in a notch
down<00:02:06.619> there<00:02:06.890> really<00:02:07.640> only<00:02:07.789> kind<00:02:08.030> of<00:02:08.090> fits<00:02:08.300> in

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
down there really only kind of fits in

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.920 
down there really only kind of fits in
one<00:02:08.630> way

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.410 

nothing<00:02:13.930> pushes<00:02:14.260> back<00:02:14.440> in<00:02:15.120> that's<00:02:16.120> it

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
nothing pushes back in that's it

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.880 
nothing pushes back in that's it
reinstall<00:02:16.960> the<00:02:17.020> lever<00:02:17.290> screw<00:02:17.560> in<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.770> nut

you'll<00:02:30.010> notice<00:02:30.220> it's<00:02:30.370> like<00:02:30.460> a<00:02:30.490> thrust<00:02:30.790> washer

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
you'll notice it's like a thrust washer

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.750 
you'll notice it's like a thrust washer
on<00:02:31.240> the<00:02:31.330> top<00:02:31.570> and<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:32.380> bottom<00:02:32.530> like<00:02:33.460> we<00:02:33.580> said

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
on the top and the bottom like we said

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.190 
on the top and the bottom like we said
in<00:02:33.850> the<00:02:33.940> intro<00:02:34.210> you<00:02:34.390> have<00:02:34.540> to<00:02:34.660> sometimes<00:02:34.870> kind

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
in the intro you have to sometimes kind

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.020 
in the intro you have to sometimes kind
of<00:02:35.320> grind<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.190> remove<00:02:36.430> some<00:02:36.640> of<00:02:36.670> that<00:02:36.820> powder

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
of grind to remove some of that powder

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.970 
of grind to remove some of that powder
coating<00:02:37.480> some<00:02:37.960> of<00:02:38.050> the<00:02:38.110> excess<00:02:38.350> material<00:02:38.470> even

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
coating some of the excess material even

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.040 
coating some of the excess material even
still<00:02:39.220> with<00:02:39.370> doing<00:02:40.210> some<00:02:40.360> of<00:02:40.450> that<00:02:40.480> removal<00:02:40.960> we

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
still with doing some of that removal we

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.360 
still with doing some of that removal we
only<00:02:41.230> have<00:02:41.440> enough<00:02:41.680> room<00:02:41.830> for<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:42.160> thrust

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
only have enough room for the thrust

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.610 
only have enough room for the thrust
washer<00:02:42.610> on<00:02:42.910> the<00:02:43.030> top<00:02:43.210> side<00:02:43.450> definitely<00:02:44.140> best

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
washer on the top side definitely best

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.380 
washer on the top side definitely best
to<00:02:45.190> actually<00:02:45.280> get<00:02:45.550> them<00:02:45.670> on<00:02:45.760> both<00:02:45.940> sides<00:02:46.180> if<00:02:46.300> we

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
to actually get them on both sides if we

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.210 
to actually get them on both sides if we
had<00:02:46.510> a<00:02:46.540> little<00:02:46.690> bit<00:02:46.900> more<00:02:47.260> tools<00:02:47.980> at<00:02:48.190> our

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
had a little bit more tools at our

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.950 
had a little bit more tools at our
disposal<00:02:48.280> we<00:02:48.730> would<00:02:48.910> do<00:02:49.000> it<00:02:49.120> that<00:02:49.240> way<00:02:49.420> but

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
disposal we would do it that way but

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.750 
disposal we would do it that way but
yeah<00:02:50.140> then<00:02:50.350> you<00:02:50.680> know<00:02:50.770> obviously<00:02:51.280> apply<00:02:51.730> a

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
yeah then you know obviously apply a

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.980 
yeah then you know obviously apply a
little<00:02:52.030> bit<00:02:52.120> of<00:02:52.210> grease<00:02:52.360> to<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:52.600> top<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:52.930> the

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
little bit of grease to the top and the

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:58.770 
little bit of grease to the top and the
bottom<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.470> friction<00:02:54.190> point<00:02:57.510> visit<00:02:58.510> put<00:02:58.690> the

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
bottom the friction point visit put the

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.320 
bottom the friction point visit put the
lever<00:02:58.960> in<00:02:59.140> place<00:02:59.460> drop<00:03:00.460> the<00:03:00.610> screw<00:03:00.820> down<00:03:01.030> and

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
lever in place drop the screw down and

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.000 
lever in place drop the screw down and
then<00:03:01.540> put<00:03:01.960> the<00:03:02.050> nut<00:03:02.200> on<00:03:02.230> from<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:02.650> underside

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
then put the nut on from the underside

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.420 
then put the nut on from the underside
and<00:03:03.820> again<00:03:04.210> that's<00:03:04.390> pretty<00:03:04.570> much<00:03:04.780> it<00:03:04.990> for<00:03:05.020> the

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
and again that's pretty much it for the

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.860 
and again that's pretty much it for the
black<00:03:06.430> powder<00:03:06.670> coated<00:03:07.090> breakaway<00:03:07.570> lovers

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
black powder coated breakaway lovers

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.630 
black powder coated breakaway lovers
from<00:03:08.020> Bizet<00:03:08.410> II<00:03:08.440> again<00:03:09.130> these<00:03:09.250> will<00:03:09.400> work<00:03:09.490> on

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
from Bizet II again these will work on
