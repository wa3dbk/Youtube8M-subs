00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.130
 hi of the world it's against joining him 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.179
 for a long awaited video 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.519
 by the players 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.850
 we think so who is the briefcase 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.680
 bold or him there level the value 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.880
 good brief ges in argentina was showing 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.560
 very quickly this manna is everything 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.060
 simply because it's like the xbox 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.580
 it is very simple you go alone 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:36.469
 laughs what we were all angry at 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:38.670
 not go alone we will not go either 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:42.930
 so I would like kind and a few words 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.399
 to say apart it's been a month since 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.559
 I did not make any video besides 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.530
 it's not a video to show m 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.809
 so I had a little bit of 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.860
 controllers and others to connect 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.840
 on the channel i uta where I had 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.379
 questions on my youtube channel or 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.360
 Facebook 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.550
 but I did not have much time 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.800
 with us repeat my studies and others 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.500
 while now I'm going to try 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.970
 a little more will give me that you have 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.710
 had customers who actually have some 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.909
 people that vmware clients have 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.799
 started making videos that when the 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.049
 videos and had one on two people 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.970
 which was opening harmonization removes 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.320
 task nor the right words short this is the 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.710
 often said of the team and the 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.549
 lighting also welded the book 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.619
 then what am I going to tell you 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.350
 of water on this case is that so 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.299
 now I 'm doing on ps3 is enough 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.770
 important because it's a big 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.079
 nobody ps3 they were waiting for this 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.409
 joystick and I vociferate in drome colors 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.319
 so that's it but in chrome 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:39.319
 red legs full and his three 

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:41.840
 other colors are going to be for the 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:43.759
 gives for the xbox so it depends on 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.799
 orders the interested people who 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:50.509
 want some pictures or other I will put 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:51.859
 on on skype or finally we put the 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.149
 question I gave them the picture under 

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:55.929
 skype for on facebook i will give some 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:59.659
 eyes gas links I feel that the site 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:01.250
 green screen january spoke i 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.049
 new in too much if the iphone 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.819
 of apple is my controller it's not 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:08.030
 serious is football must certainly 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:09.530
 be corrected by or bmx medical hd who 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.140
 had done less at our water I 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.730
 thanks a lot for that it's a 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.349
 other where I kept during my paw me 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:21.290
 so making it a great challenge for 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:23.810
 me it's better and I'll try to 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.129
 resume videos faster and not 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.750
 necessarily that the videos is also the 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:29.120
 order for those interested 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:33.950
 because Japanese often means no 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:36.829
 I'm really sorry about that and I think 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.889
 that the video will reach the bafin had 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:41.959
 so now and for others 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:43.040
 questions more questions especially by 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.609
 price ratio must be told that a 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.709
 case ds3 costs 60 euros 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:50.780
 we must add the price of 30 euros 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:54.650
 I managed to get a price for too much 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:57.590
 expensive to have it's a mess to see 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.329
 the color gold and that's okay 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.639
 at most had finally this is 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.799
 almost will be expensive it's about 30 

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:05.520
 euros by the flight of your red color 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.500
 romeo 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.730
 but now what I propose is 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.840
 also to buy there briefcases 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.690
 opportunities so it's way too much to 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.580
 cheaper especially if it is agreed 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.190
 what is slope and not the interior so 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.260
 the most important is that so 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.370
 the outside is always with the 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.080
 museum will always be round and year 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.660
 after year for the sake of death 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:28.020
 at all nine all clean not so I 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.190
 redo a little let go long-awaited toros 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.140
 left of the controller is not the 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.450
 color against what 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.830
 beautiful so here are two certainly 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.180
 make a new controller to two 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.000
 montbeliard people not necessarily 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.620
 known but yes for those who do the 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.140
 people around the 10,000 subscribers for their 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.640
 to make a joystick we will get the 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.710
 new subscriber or renault music even though 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.260
 at least as less polluting for the 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:52.470
 moment but we will say for good reason that 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.030
 video patrols I lost a bit 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.050
 subscribers let's say that will fall so 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.220
 on this month I wish you a good 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.500
 late evening so we are 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.780
 currently from Tuesday 4 to voiceless 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.820
 it is to you after I 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.750
 wish a good evening 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.750
 hello guys to a next video
