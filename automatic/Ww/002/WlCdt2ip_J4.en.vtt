00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.350
 hello to all friends to open more finally we also have the last one 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.350
 device off with high heels 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:20.020
 here are two cakes let's say you have revolutionized the world of gods once again 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:21.089
 tablets 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:23.329
 one regarding anyway 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:27.050
 it is only the only models that are fait 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:30.659
 but then also because it still carries 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:33.659
 other features we are going to see together now 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.210
 the first physical characteristic 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.890
 that you notice yourself 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.140
 the subtlety 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.930
 of the device 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.510
 much lighter 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.440
 not so much though it feels that it was enough 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.160
 however it is lighter than the first generation part 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.539
 then we have 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.410
 the speaker here 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.640
 lower right much more powerful than 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.120
 the one mounted 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.490
 on the first generation ipad 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.570
 which then 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.409
 we have the camera 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.500
 front 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.500
 the camera 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.420
 paid churches 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.420
 one of the ends because dvd this 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.970
 device is definitely the camera 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.479
 camera who does not shoot 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.400
 some beautiful photos 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.610
 1 of piedmont certain votes vote because it is 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.820
 however the resolution is of just 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.220
 how to understand if it is 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.730
 marco is above all or why 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.460
 the ipad camera 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.210
 daniela was conceived as a camera but rather as a video camera 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.170
 therefore we will not have the possibility to register 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.490
 movies the 720p binaries then in high definition 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.960
 that the mind results 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.990
 much more 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.990
 daily state police to photos 

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:14.719
 made with either a front or rear camera 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:18.589
 another feature 

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:21.859
 of this device thanks also with 

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:25.819
 alessia 4 episode 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.419
 we have the presence of 

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:30.659
 life is time so we will have 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:32.019
 Possibility of 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.949
 make 

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:40.479
 nadar solo video calls and fon 4 aipa 2 also to fourth generation potacchio 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.839
 In this case I will use my e-mail address 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.649
 however it looks like model you just want to do 

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:50.499
 nancy for those who 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:52.769
 vest 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.719
 the three-lap model 

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:59.329
 or. will use the connected phone number has the micro sim 

00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:03.959
 then another application is present only 

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:08.679
 nepal 2 photos. 

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:12.039

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:15.829
 feedback 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.819
 precisely he brings films 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.799
 of the effects 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.379
 to the photos 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:24.549
 let's go to dr1 for example this one 

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:28.899
 I could 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.069
 and so on 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:36.139
 we'll have 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.139
 this nice application 

00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:43.179
 you can use with friends 

00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:46.419
 we see 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:51.370
 other important characteristics, of course, are known as the branch 

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:54.579
 from 256k model 512 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:58.199
 then we have 

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:01.079
 a graphic 9 times 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:03.839
 + fast 

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:07.279
 we also change the processor too 

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:10.590

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:25.069
 this one I bought green 

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:29.349
 in my opinion the sky blue was a little too much 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:31.360
 sure 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.779
 I thought it was a little clearer 

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:38.719
 in rock wine really liked the green then let's see how it works 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:45.840
 let's see immediately 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.840
 r 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.090

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:16.360
 let's review everything 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.050
 therefore 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.120
 eheh his crazy man city attachment 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.169

 d select via settings 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.559
 via settings 

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:39.210
 in fact not in general 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.250
 block 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:41.449
 unlock with 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:47.419
 of the churches land anon. possibility of trento choose whether to activate 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:48.919

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:50.400
 this function 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.610
 products to see I also activated the just us 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.319
 multitrack 

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:00.159
 let's look briefly at how they work 

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:04.869

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.839
 multitasking 

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:14.360
 now we open an application always with four or five fingers 

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:15.990
 we'll have 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.610
 ability of monks redoing on harper 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.689

 we can move 

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:26.339
 between applications and then 

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:29.339
 by doing this we could close 

00:06:30.809 --> 00:06:33.969
 the application 

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:35.839
