00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
right there is a pin that goes through

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.849 
right there is a pin that goes through
the<00:00:20.220> shaft<00:00:20.820> for<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.240> spider<00:00:21.539> gears<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:22.650> has

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
the shaft for the spider gears that has

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.060 
the shaft for the spider gears that has
to<00:00:23.039> be<00:00:23.189> unbolted

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
to be unbolted

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.170 
to be unbolted
well<00:00:26.070> before<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.550> do<00:00:26.640> that<00:00:26.820> why<00:00:26.970> don't<00:00:27.029> you

well before you do that why don't you
give<00:00:28.109> us<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.260> little<00:00:28.380> tour<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.769> anatomy

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
give us a little tour of the anatomy

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.769 
give us a little tour of the anatomy
here<00:00:29.429> what<00:00:29.550> are<00:00:29.640> we<00:00:29.699> looking<00:00:29.939> at<00:00:30.029> all<00:00:30.630> right

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
here what are we looking at all right

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.209 
here what are we looking at all right
here<00:00:31.109> we<00:00:31.320> have<00:00:31.529> our<00:00:32.450> ring<00:00:33.450> gear<00:00:33.719> we've<00:00:34.710> got<00:00:34.980> our

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
here we have our ring gear we've got our

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.520 
here we have our ring gear we've got our
open<00:00:35.940> differential<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:37.020> then<00:00:37.230> we've<00:00:37.350> got<00:00:37.500> our

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
open differential and then we've got our

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.830 
open differential and then we've got our
spider<00:00:37.890> gears<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.520> center<00:00:38.820> shaft<00:00:39.059> and

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
spider gears and the center shaft and

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.660 
spider gears and the center shaft and
then<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.410> don't<00:00:40.649> know<00:00:40.739> if<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:40.920> can<00:00:41.040> see<00:00:41.250> but<00:00:41.520> the

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
then I don't know if you can see but the

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.549 
then I don't know if you can see but the
axle<00:00:42.059> shaft<00:00:42.090> ends<00:00:42.809> are<00:00:42.960> right<00:00:43.140> here<00:00:43.410> up

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
axle shaft ends are right here up

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.080 
axle shaft ends are right here up
against<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:44.010> spider<00:00:44.280> gear<00:00:44.520> shaft<00:00:44.760> and

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
against that spider gear shaft and

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.139 
against that spider gear shaft and
inside<00:00:45.899> these<00:00:46.230> two<00:00:46.500> larger<00:00:46.950> gears<00:00:47.190> there<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.120> a

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
inside these two larger gears there is a

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.270 
inside these two larger gears there is a
c-clip<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.899> that's<00:00:49.530> what<00:00:49.680> holds<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.129> whole

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
c-clip and that's what holds the whole

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.889 
c-clip and that's what holds the whole
axle<00:00:50.640> in<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.760> hose<00:00:50.969> that's<00:00:51.210> what<00:00:51.449> holds<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.750> in

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
axle in the hose that's what holds it in

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.420 
axle in the hose that's what holds it in
the<00:00:51.989> housing<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.500> we<00:00:52.739> want<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.070> take<00:00:53.250> these

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
the housing and we want to take these

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.549 
the housing and we want to take these
off<00:00:53.640> because<00:00:54.059> we're<00:00:54.390> going<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.809> detail

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
housing and our new brake kit requires

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.119 
housing and our new brake kit requires
that<00:00:59.129> we<00:00:59.309> change<00:00:59.640> this<00:01:00.390> drum<00:01:00.780> disaster<00:01:01.410> in

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
that we change this drum disaster in

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.439 
that we change this drum disaster in
order<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.489> do<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:03.000> gotta<00:01:03.149> take<00:01:03.300> the

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
order to do that you gotta take the

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.359 
order to do that you gotta take the
axles<00:01:03.809> out<00:01:04.040> all<00:01:05.040> right

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
axles out all right

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.210 
axles out all right
where's<00:01:06.030> this<00:01:06.210> pin<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.600> speak<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:07.049> it's<00:01:08.010> on

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
where's this pin you speak of it's on

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:15.280 
where's this pin you speak of it's on
top<00:01:08.520> here<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.979> unscrews<00:01:10.979> by<00:01:11.490> hand<00:01:11.760> by<00:01:12.360> hand

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.270 

just<00:01:16.290> tell<00:01:16.470> them<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.860> previously

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
just tell them this is previously

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.350 
just tell them this is previously
loosened<00:01:17.430> it's<00:01:18.240> actually<00:01:18.600> magic<00:01:20.090> nice<00:01:21.090> and

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
loosened it's actually magic nice and

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.080 
loosened it's actually magic nice and
then<00:01:22.229> without<00:01:22.799> taking<00:01:23.280> these<00:01:23.430> bearing<00:01:23.820> caps

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
then without taking these bearing caps

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.950 
then without taking these bearing caps
off<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.960> have<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.350> roll<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:26.310> whole<00:01:27.150> unit<00:01:27.600> back

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
off you have to roll the whole unit back

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.440 
off you have to roll the whole unit back
farther<00:01:28.290> in<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.590> housing<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.880> actually<00:01:30.240> pull

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
farther in the housing to actually pull

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.380 
farther in the housing to actually pull
that<00:01:30.600> pin<00:01:30.840> out<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.040> because<00:01:32.430> because

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
that pin out and that is because because

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.870 
that pin out and that is because because
there<00:01:33.840> are<00:01:34.049> clearance<00:01:34.560> issues<00:01:34.920> with<00:01:35.340> the

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
there are clearance issues with the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.899 
there are clearance issues with the
minke<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.350> main<00:01:37.829> caps<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.490> then<00:01:38.729> there's

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
minke the main caps and then there's

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.990 
minke the main caps and then there's
also<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.600> steel<00:01:40.320> wall<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.460> main<00:01:41.610> cap<00:01:41.850> of

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
also a steel wall that the main cap of

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
bolt to inside the housing that make

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.679 
bolt to inside the housing that make
clearance<00:01:44.549> issues<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.030> pull<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:45.329> pin<00:01:45.540> out

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
clearance issues to pull this pin out

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.590 
clearance issues to pull this pin out
all<00:01:45.960> right<00:01:48.170> and<00:01:49.170> then<00:01:49.439> once<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:49.740> pin<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.310> out

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
all right and then once that pin is out

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.859 
all right and then once that pin is out
the<00:01:52.579> spider<00:01:53.579> gear<00:01:53.909> shaft<00:01:54.149> should<00:01:54.509> pull<00:01:54.689> right

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
the spider gear shaft should pull right

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:12.400 
the spider gear shaft should pull right
out

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.680 

and<00:02:13.410> then<00:02:13.650> out<00:02:13.860> come<00:02:14.160> your<00:02:14.640> spider<00:02:15.000> gears<00:02:15.330> and

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
and then out come your spider gears and

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.240 
and then out come your spider gears and
that's<00:02:15.990> it<00:02:16.110> right<00:02:16.260> there<00:02:16.290> huh<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.010> shins

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
that's it right there huh and the shins

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.890 
that's it right there huh and the shins
and<00:02:17.459> those<00:02:17.790> shims<00:02:18.060> got<00:02:18.300> to<00:02:18.390> go<00:02:18.450> back<00:02:18.630> on<00:02:18.810> the

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
and those shims got to go back on the

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.720 
and those shims got to go back on the
right<00:02:19.080> gears<00:02:19.350> okay<00:02:21.530> okay<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:22.740> then<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:23.459> get

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
right gears okay okay and then to get

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.520 
right gears okay okay and then to get
the<00:02:24.060> other<00:02:24.209> one<00:02:24.420> out<00:02:24.450> usually<00:02:24.750> one<00:02:25.170> will<00:02:25.320> fall

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
the other one out usually one will fall

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.870 
the other one out usually one will fall
out<00:02:25.560> but<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:26.070> get<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.280> other<00:02:26.400> one<00:02:26.580> out<00:02:26.610> you

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
out but to get the other one out you

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.170 
out but to get the other one out you
actually<00:02:27.000> have<00:02:27.330> to<00:02:27.570> roll<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.770> axles<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.610> get

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
actually have to roll the axles to get

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.550 
actually have to roll the axles to get
that<00:02:30.330> gear<00:02:30.540> up<00:02:32.840> because<00:02:33.840> it<00:02:33.959> has<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.230> work<00:02:34.380> its

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
that gear up because it has to work its

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.940 
that gear up because it has to work its
way<00:02:34.680> around<00:02:34.970> okay<00:02:36.200> so<00:02:37.200> it<00:02:37.350> was<00:02:37.470> kind<00:02:37.770> of<00:02:37.800> in<00:02:37.920> the

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
way around okay so it was kind of in the

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.680 
way around okay so it was kind of in the
top<00:02:38.160> side<00:02:38.520> of<00:02:38.670> that<00:02:38.730> differential<00:02:39.150> case<00:02:39.510> when

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
top side of that differential case when

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.060 
top side of that differential case when
you<00:02:39.780> took<00:02:39.870> it<00:02:39.930> out<00:02:40.110> correct<00:02:40.680> that's<00:02:40.860> what<00:02:40.980> you

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
you took it out correct that's what you

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.300 
you took it out correct that's what you
meant

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
meant

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.660 
meant
okay<00:02:41.550> and<00:02:42.300> then<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.830> way<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.040> get<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.310> c-clip

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
okay and then the way to get the c-clip

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.430 
okay and then the way to get the c-clip
out<00:02:44.880> that's<00:02:45.090> inside<00:02:45.420> these<00:02:45.600> larger<00:02:45.989> gears<00:02:46.200> you

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
out that's inside these larger gears you

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.650 
out that's inside these larger gears you
just<00:02:46.620> push<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:46.980> axle<00:02:47.310> in<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:48.120> that<00:02:48.239> c-clip

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
just push the axle in and that c-clip

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.870 
just push the axle in and that c-clip
flies<00:02:48.900> right<00:02:49.080> off<00:02:49.160> and<00:02:50.160> let's<00:02:50.340> see<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.520> c-clip

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
flies right off and let's see the c-clip

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.620 
flies right off and let's see the c-clip
it<00:02:51.390> is<00:02:51.570> indeed<00:02:51.900> a<00:02:52.140> c-clip<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.489> then<00:02:54.420> Scott

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
it is indeed a c-clip and then Scott

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:01.150 
it is indeed a c-clip and then Scott
takes<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.080> axle<00:02:55.410> out<00:02:55.500> and<00:02:55.800> hits<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.070> toolbox

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.190 

you<00:03:02.160> just<00:03:02.340> popped<00:03:02.580> another<00:03:02.730> c-clip<00:03:03.330> on<00:03:03.570> there

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
you just popped another c-clip on there

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:11.000 
you just popped another c-clip on there
you<00:03:04.290> go<00:03:04.470> and<00:03:05.130> then<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.370> axle<00:03:09.709> and<00:03:10.709> I<00:03:10.799> think

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
you go and then the axle and I think

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:17.180 
you go and then the axle and I think
that's<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.430> magic<00:03:14.330> all<00:03:15.330> right<00:03:15.390> and<00:03:15.870> we<00:03:16.799> tested

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
that's the magic all right and we tested

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.949 
that's the magic all right and we tested
this<00:03:17.310> actually<00:03:17.610> goes<00:03:17.730> back<00:03:17.910> together<00:03:18.090> yes

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
this actually goes back together yes

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.560 
this actually goes back together yes
yeah<00:03:19.470> that's<00:03:20.340> what<00:03:20.549> Donna<00:03:20.820> wants<00:03:20.910> finger

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
yeah that's what Donna wants finger

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:27.270 
yeah that's what Donna wants finger
tight<00:03:21.890> right

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.910 

are<00:03:28.280> you<00:03:28.460> really
