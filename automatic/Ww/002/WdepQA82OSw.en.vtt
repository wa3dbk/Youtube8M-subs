this<00:01:12.620> we're<00:01:13.310> going<00:01:13.430> to<00:01:13.490> look<00:01:13.640> at<00:01:13.880> it<00:01:14.030> and<00:01:14.120> see

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
this we're going to look at it and see

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.210 
this we're going to look at it and see
that<00:01:14.510> the<00:01:14.750> passenger<00:01:15.590> side<00:01:15.740> of<00:01:15.800> the<00:01:15.920> coach

we're just going to raise it up until we
look<00:01:22.760> like<00:01:22.910> we<00:01:23.030> get<00:01:23.210> close<00:01:23.420> to<00:01:23.570> the<00:01:23.630> level<00:01:25.540> and

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
look like we get close to the level and

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.180 
look like we get close to the level and
it<00:01:26.720> looks<00:01:26.930> pretty<00:01:27.170> good<00:01:27.440> just<00:01:27.710> from<00:01:27.830> here<00:01:28.010> just

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
really good system not a retract turn

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.480 
really good system not a retract turn
the<00:02:11.780> system<00:02:11.930> back<00:02:12.260> on<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:13.010> first<00:02:13.250> thing<00:02:13.400> you

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490
