stormrage wallpaper uh he asked me to

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.180 
stormrage wallpaper uh he asked me to
make<00:00:08.010> a<00:00:08.280> Android<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:09.230> wallpaper<00:00:10.230> like<00:00:10.740> it<00:00:10.980> and

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
make a Android a wallpaper like it and

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.950 
make a Android a wallpaper like it and
so<00:00:12.150> this<00:00:12.480> is<00:00:12.540> my<00:00:12.840> shot<00:00:13.200> at<00:00:13.410> making<00:00:13.620> one<00:00:14.009> and<00:00:14.960> the

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
so this is my shot at making one and the

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.050 
so this is my shot at making one and the
problem<00:00:16.350> is<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.680> lot<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:16.920> phones<00:00:17.190> especially

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
problem is a lot of phones especially

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
problem is a lot of phones especially
androids<00:00:18.869> have<00:00:19.880> really<00:00:20.880> different<00:00:21.300> screen

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
androids have really different screen

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.550 
androids have really different screen
resolutions<00:00:22.160> so<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.789> results<00:00:24.210> may<00:00:24.330> vary<00:00:24.560> very

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
resolutions so the results may vary very

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.310 
resolutions so the results may vary very
much<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:26.070> as<00:00:27.060> well<00:00:27.300> does<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.720> specs<00:00:27.990> of<00:00:28.170> the

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
much and as well does the specs of the

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.099 
much and as well does the specs of the
phones<00:00:28.590> so<00:00:29.369> not<00:00:29.970> every<00:00:30.330> phone<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.720> guaranteed

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
phones so not every phone is guaranteed

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.500 
phones so not every phone is guaranteed
to<00:00:31.140> be<00:00:31.500> able<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.830> run<00:00:32.009> this<00:00:32.189> without<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:33.030> topic

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
to be able to run this without the topic

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.130 
to be able to run this without the topic
lagging<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.800> this<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.989> kind<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:38.120> how<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.180> /

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
lagging so this is kind of a how to /
