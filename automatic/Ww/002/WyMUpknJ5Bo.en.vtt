 mean this mask i use pumpkin juice 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.400
 It turns out most likely not this mask 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.950
 tonic mask because it is very liquid 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.159
 by its consistency if you want 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.200
 just get a mask then you can 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.720
 use mashed potatoes 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.420
 1 you can do with a blender 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.159
 either that's how i have a smoothie maker but 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.820
 Today I use it, I rubbed juice 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:41.960
 pre- pumpkin on a fine grater 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:46.110
 means to get some kind of foundation 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.570
 small for my husband so that it will be easier for me 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.820

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.149
 Bin can use gauze two layers and 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.280
 I squeezed this mass and sales from this 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:00.440
 masses juice here I got about 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.090
 from 50 grams of pumpkin that's so much juice 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.190
 you can use any number 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.510
 components at your discretion in 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:12.500
 principle doesn't matter now i add in 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:15.200
 this juice to extract from it 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.240
 helpful vitamins a and e as we know 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.700
 vitamin a and and they are fat soluble 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.700
 vitamins are the main fighters with the first 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.590
 signs of aging with fine wrinkles 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:28.030
 we have to add some kind of fat 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:33.080
 oil it can be olive oil 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:36.410
 avocado oil flaxseed oil 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.900
 that is, absolutely any oil but I 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.580
 today in stock 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.140
 peach oil here I have it 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.920
 peach oil will therefore 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.740
 use this oil as fat for 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.830
 dissolving anthony on a or mean than 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:54.650
 we generally butter useful peach butter 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:59.240
 it means she tightens our skin 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.800
 her more elastic she stops 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.650
 aging process 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.989
 she well moisturizes and still peach 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.520
 oil it is our spirit allergen that is 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:11.870
 It is suitable for all skin types and 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.590
 peach oil does not cause any 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:18.140
 allergic reactions to any skin 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:22.160
 add any amount of this 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.959
 oils here so probably enough and more 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.600
 one component will serve on for 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.739
 our mask is cream cream can be 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.700
 plant and animal 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:33.650
 at your discretion but here I use not 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.340
 I know the kind of cream that I have in 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.000
 the presence of 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:41.300
 that is, one pack of cream if there is 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.250
 you cream in big packaging just 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.870
 from there pour some amount i 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:49.870
 I use everything here and this 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:53.840
 so now we will stir 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:56.360
 this mask is tonic because you see 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.970
 what liquid consistency is obtained 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.590
 I want to say that this mask is very good 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.709
 for dry and prone to dry skin it 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.670
 nutritional 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:11.880
 after it no need to wash that is 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:14.970
 face will be so velvety tender 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.980
 the film is absolutely not annoying you 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.060
 there is like you put light 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:23.060
 moisturizing or light nourishing cream 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.330
 while using the dishes as you see 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.520
 plastics 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.620
 ceramics in any case not the metal 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:33.419
 still in the metal i find oxidized 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:35.480
 products and it is not advisable to prepare masks 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:38.880
 in metal and 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:43.250
 so now we have to take some 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:46.669
 bread maska and soak up this mask 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:49.710
 our tonic here I have it 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:54.540
 soaked this mask swells 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:58.940
 getting more more absorbs into 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:00.210
 myself our tonic everything now i'm her 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.620

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.050
 one-handed not sure to do it 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.210
 difficult most likely on this and finish 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:10.950

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.490
 to you that I will put this mask on myself 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.450

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:27.390
 dries and everything on this procedure will be 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:29.789
 completed if you will use 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:33.110
 mashed potatoes that make with a blender
