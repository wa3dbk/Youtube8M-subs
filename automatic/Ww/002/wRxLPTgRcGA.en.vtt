00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.720
 yes, it had snowed and we 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.279
 Once wanted to get out of the fridge 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.140
 and then the right snow because of it 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.110
 we got up early last friday 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:37.010
 namely to winterberg and indeed completely 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.540
 exactly the post lisa yes as you have seen 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.769
 our arrival must be delayed 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.330
 then instead of the two and a half hours over 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:43.309
 Needed normal wants this time 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.160
 unfortunately 5 but we have this 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.360
 Then I saw the panorama and got it right away 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.840
 thought that has definitely 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.580
 worth 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.930
 on the postwiese now scarce 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.960
 seven and a half kilometers of runway 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:01:00.140
 they were almost all open up 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:01.370
 a lift yes as you see next to the 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.690
 There was also a bit of powder on the piste 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.960
 So a bit of deep snow and us 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.160
 have a few tips filmed for you 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.050
 how to drive deep snow better 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.869
 as he saw at the intro , it is 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:15.259
 unfortunately very very quiet and wanted 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.970
 Do not do you any of these 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.670
 quiet recordings by listening to it 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.509
 with tips from me is about voice over 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.890
 First of all , it is important for us 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.160
 to see us more and more on the back 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.599
 as on the front with it one lifts oneself 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.580
 not with the loose snow and man 

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:31.399
 can drive a bit more stable tip 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.780
 Number two is someone standing still 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:33.979
 unless you are especially small 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.200
 hillside that means you have one again 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.459
 little bit sweeping in front of him otherwise 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.270
 but does not get stuck very quickly 

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:41.209
 and I think that's the worst 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.099
 what can happen to you and rule 

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:44.599
 never never never never never never 

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:46.009
 Bindings from target in deep snow 

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:47.959
 even if the robot and a few millimeters 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.140
 sinking in deep snow it may be that 

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:52.009
 under a lot of snow 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.209
 is buried and when the word of 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.259
 undress and then take a step 

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:56.209
 the word makes it can be that one 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.860
 very lonely and speak of their experience 

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:00.050
 it is not nice 100 meters lower to 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.500
 sinking and digging also does 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.450
 no fun during the day was the park 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.380
 unfortunately not given because of this 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.709
 you guys a bit like that here 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.130
 mini park pleasure such as show pictures 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.400
 from that 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.780
 that was then made up after only time 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.760
 Unfortunately it was too dark at night 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.560
 in the park, however , film consumption comes 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.360
 unfortunately no video material 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.710
 that they can see this was otherwise 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.970
 has a lot of fun my 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:29.100
 get along refrigerator 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.100
 to have the left'm back on board 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.090
 it will soon be a video blog 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.890
 and that's what we're going to do this night 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.420
 Munich designed that you from there 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.950
 can also go with a few impressions 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.690
 that also pleases if you like that 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.080
 in between a little something different 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.000
 make exceptions only both educational videos 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.370
 then with the very simple thumbs up 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.800
 and we take that and try 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.530
 a little bit more of yours in the 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.310
 to show real world 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.650
 otherwise that we will tell you the 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.190
 last pictures in the dark and see us 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.190
 the next week
