00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.309
 first video and that will be a view moreover 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.170
 walther p99 signal 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:13.410
 the whole thing comes in this chic 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.839
 packaging and yes the end pretty 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.150
 his knife but who is not happy 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.250
 when a mass gets that unpacks and 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.660
 then such a pack is in front of you 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.990
 So yes it was a point which, however 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.140
 is very bad from time to time 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.230
 is done today is further these 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.870
 unscrew here used the needed 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.090
 other special screwdriver not 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.129
 is enclosed 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.200
 however , other youtubers had a gone 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.200
 you should find yourself 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.760
 to tinker and the link to the video on 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.760
 I'll give you in the description and 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.309
 that's a pity and a shame 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.609
 a little bit unsophisticated from there but that 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.530
 do 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:03.750
 the back that it was quite a 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.299
 Highlight of the knife of the term 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.530
 is interchangeable that is you have 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.130
 maybe already on the packaging 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.340
 seen 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.450
 Here you can see the picture again 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:18.150
 There are two others in the packaging 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.590
 pieces settled him and then so 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.759
 can swap 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.770
 the smallest was initially mounted anna 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.320
 when the knife comes I have it then 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.390
 swapped for the middle and got 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.700
 given to the smallest here or now 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.790
 was in front of the middle and here is the 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.140
 biggest and here is a little one below 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.430
 screwdriver for 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.650
 unscrew screws with those one 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.660
 can exchange and therefore only 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.810
 five to eight screws so sure what 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.220
 once a woman 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.630
 if you wanted to exchange that then 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:58.200
 Just screw this screw here 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:00.390
 out and those on the back and 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:08.460
 then the handle piece could easily be replaced 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:10.760
 the back is pulling a cover 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:14.070
 also included 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:16.500
 she closes with a button and the 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:20.840
 finally done so on purpose 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:23.730
 you can put it on the belt 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.380
 horizontally and vertically depending on how 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:30.690
 must fix right on the left and 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:36.540
 Hardly came to the knife of steel 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:40.980
 is a 440 it stole a lot the 440 s 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:43.290
 It is thus stainless and what a state 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.209
 really like is that he good the knife 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.600
 gives allround properties 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:51.780
 because the state is not the hardest 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.209
 Therefore but quickly focuses on 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.360
 grinds and keeps the sharpness 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.340
 also pretty good 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.000
 the warrior is black coated like 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.190
 you see here 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.680
 and this is about 14 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:11.250
 percent and I think I'm cool 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:13.470
 so much the handle is ergonomic 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.209
 adapted the hand and really lies 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.700
 if you have the right handle pieces of 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.019
 100 perfect in your hand so there is 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.980
 nothing to complain about 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:24.480
 here is still shipping for merkel 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.280
 is not like some knives 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.200
 you are not too strong at all 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:33.090
 hurts, even if it is longer this way 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:35.910
 firmly in the hand has nothing bothers 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.920
 you can cut the knife in two ways either 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.350
 here with the thumb the place itself 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.480
 right and left are so you can 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.670
 it with the right hand as well as with 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:52.349
 the left hand up 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:56.129
 that looks like it locks that up 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:58.290
 Entirely with a liner lures the leaves 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:01.650
 well he could go a bit further 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.970
 come in but that fits that now 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.530
 really everything 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:10.620
 nothing wobbles the second way is 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.390
 this pinball here back the that 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.879
 means he can with right and anyway 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.360
 opened on the left so pressed 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.930
 become 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:23.130
 You can see it down here 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.900
 and back at the same time away and 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:30.449
 practically shoots the blade so 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:33.090
 I say it should be like this 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:42.449
 Look and left as I said 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:46.260
 on the sharpness so it is still 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:49.139
 I've never used except 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.340
 but it works for very small switzerland 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:53.070
 actually not really for 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:57.300
 so his sharpness did not change 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:59.660
 really sometimes not nothing the times 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.660
 short 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:18.120
 too much is nothing 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:38.590
 so it's not what harms her, though 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:42.650
 it is quite useful sharpness 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:53.950
 the poem is not a clue much though 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:06:00.560
 plus there is indeed so that 178 grams 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:06:09.290
 the case weighs 49 grams and both 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:12.440
 together with 222 grams that is 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:18.080
 now for a knife in our bigger 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:20.210
 So the tinker course is 420 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.000
 millimeters long and the total length 2 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:25.340
 123 mm 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.440
 that's the weight for that size 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:30.830
 not very hard but not too 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:34.880
 easily it's pretty much centered 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:37.640
 but really very good hand with 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.230
 The grip of the plastic is also 

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:43.850
 very hard plastic that really 

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:45.770
 endures a lot and somehow feels 

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:48.920
 not like normal plastic 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:51.760
 but no idea is so completely 

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:57.650
 funny stuff again very good 

00:06:51.760 --> 00:07:02.210
 yes the sound comes from is perfect so 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:07.370
 really perfect it is 0 sound game 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:10.130
 as possible, nothing and so me 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:13.550
 think it is a very large knife to 

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:14.930
 Price of 25 euros the link at amazon 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:17.960
 I will give you the description 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:19.880
 and price of 25 euros for sure one of the 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.600
 the best knife I have to put it 

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:26.180
 can and i recommend it to anyone 

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.930
 and yes that suits me i hope it has 

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.790
 you like it 

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:31.310
 maybe we'll see again 

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:34.190
 will tell me about unlike video 

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:35.210
 and everywhere where I'm happy if something 

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.520
 to improve 

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:39.650
 what I am sure then 

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.450
 please write me in the comments is 

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:43.180
 my first video again not that the 

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:46.130
 then maybe the whole time is like that 

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:48.640
 and yes I hope you again six times 

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:48.640
 and till then
