00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210
 yes 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.410
 for the girls because they like to see 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:13.380
 great in the winter season them 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.420
 I bring a super easy and incredible time 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.060
 that you will surely like that 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.880
 we will wear a long-sleeved blouse 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.060
 of the color and texture that you prefer in 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.050
 my case I chose a fuchsia color one 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:31.210
 orange and a green color 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.190
 first take the blouse from the sleeves and it's 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:37.739
 a small fold to hide the 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.739
 label then it's a knot from behind 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:45.390
 take the sleeves and tie a knot 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.390
 under the blouse 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.570
 in this case you can use hooks 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.920
 of clothes takes both ends of the rose and 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:59.850
 pass them behind the knot 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.190
 so that they are subject in this 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.450
 case you could also use hooks 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.720
 of clothes 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:09.560
 and you should just combine it with your 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.560
 favorite sweater 

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:15.679
 again take the sleeves to your little one 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:19.189
 fold to hide the tag crosses 

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:21.420
 the sleeves from behind and then cross the 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:24.360
 string before 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.750
 and make a small knot below the 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.750
 blouse 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:34.680
 and ready only they accommodated 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:37.020
 and you will have a very elegant look 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.180
 with this style he will also perform the 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.210
 first procedure only that you will give him 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.440
 a few turns to roll the cross 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.440
 or the sleeves from behind 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.580
 and you make a small the knot below 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.510
 and ready so fast you'll have a look 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.640
 totally different 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.740
 what were some ideas to create 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.140
 your own scarf the only thing you need 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.210
 it's imagination to keep doing 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.340
 new designs to me seems like an idea 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.080
 great and you can even add a 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.420
 little glitter with some of your jewelry 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.100
 you just put it on and the look that 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.780
 it will be fantastic 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.700

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.680
