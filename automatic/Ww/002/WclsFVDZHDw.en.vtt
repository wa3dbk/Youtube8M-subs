boat dock not our IP anymore this
basically<00:00:14.690> works<00:00:15.019> by<00:00:15.520> allowing<00:00:16.520> the<00:00:16.760> boat<00:00:16.910> to

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:17.120 
basically works by allowing the boat to

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.470 
basically works by allowing the boat to

want to go back just run your boat into
the<00:00:43.670> trough<00:00:43.850> which<00:00:44.120> gives<00:00:45.050> you<00:00:45.230> enough

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
the trough which gives you enough

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.920 
the trough which gives you enough
momentum<00:00:45.650> to<00:00:45.890> go<00:00:46.250> into<00:00:46.460> the<00:00:46.550> waterfall<00:00:46.970> it's

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
momentum to go into the waterfall it's

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.840 
momentum to go into the waterfall it's
the<00:00:48.170> wall<00:00:48.350> in<00:00:48.470> the<00:00:48.530> back<00:00:48.710> which<00:00:49.370> prevents<00:00:49.760> you

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
the wall in the back which prevents you

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.220 
the wall in the back which prevents you
from<00:00:49.910> flying<00:00:50.360> out<00:00:50.540> the<00:00:50.690> other<00:00:50.780> end<00:00:51.020> of<00:00:51.170> the

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
from flying out the other end of the

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.720 
from flying out the other end of the
waterfall<00:00:51.650> load<00:00:52.460> up<00:00:52.610> and<00:00:53.380> float<00:00:54.380> 2<00:00:54.950> eb<00:00:55.370> jock

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
waterfall load up and float 2 eb jock

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.070 
waterfall load up and float 2 eb jock
and<00:00:56.200> then<00:00:57.200> exits<00:00:57.770> and<00:00:58.070> walk<00:00:58.310> back<00:00:58.520> down<00:00:58.550> so<00:00:59.120> yep

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:00.080 
and then exits and walk back down so yep

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.770 
and then exits and walk back down so yep
that's<00:01:00.110> pretty<00:01:00.800> much<00:01:01.010> how<00:01:01.160> it<00:01:01.220> works<00:01:01.780> i'm

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
that's pretty much how it works i'm

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.719 
that's pretty much how it works i'm
going<00:01:02.900> to<00:01:02.990> be<00:01:03.050> going<00:01:03.170> down<00:01:03.470> here<00:01:03.860> to<00:01:04.100> give<00:01:04.640> you

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
going to be going down here to give you

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.330 
going to be going down here to give you
a<00:01:04.820> little<00:01:04.970> closer<00:01:05.330> look<00:01:05.810> on<00:01:06.020> me<00:01:06.439> how<00:01:07.039> it<00:01:07.189> works

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
a little closer look on me how it works

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.289 
a little closer look on me how it works
oh<00:01:07.990> yeah<00:01:09.130> so<00:01:10.130> here's<00:01:10.549> on<00:01:10.729> the<00:01:10.850> other<00:01:11.000> side

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
oh yeah so here's on the other side

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.419 
oh yeah so here's on the other side
that's<00:01:11.899> the<00:01:12.079> tower<00:01:12.320> here's<00:01:12.770> the<00:01:12.829> wall<00:01:13.159> that's

00:01:13.419 --> 00:01:13.429 
that's the tower here's the wall that's

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:17.020 
that's the tower here's the wall that's
preventing<00:01:14.030> you<00:01:14.179> from<00:01:14.560> hitting<00:01:15.560> the<00:01:16.030> filling

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
preventing you from hitting the filling

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.279 
preventing you from hitting the filling
out<00:01:17.149> the<00:01:17.240> other<00:01:17.329> end<00:01:17.509> of<00:01:17.630> the<00:01:17.689> wonderful<00:01:17.929> now

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
out the other end of the wonderful now

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:20.499 
out the other end of the wonderful now
here's<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:18.710> trough<00:01:18.979> so<00:01:19.850> there's<00:01:20.030> dirt<00:01:20.240> on<00:01:20.390> the

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
here's the trough so there's dirt on the

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.469 
here's the trough so there's dirt on the
bottom<00:01:21.039> eight<00:01:22.039> blocks<00:01:22.340> or<00:01:22.850> seven<00:01:23.329> blocks

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
bottom eight blocks or seven blocks

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.749 
bottom eight blocks or seven blocks
alone<00:01:23.780> plus<00:01:24.679> the<00:01:24.859> 8th<00:01:24.979> block<00:01:25.159> which<00:01:25.460> is<00:01:25.490> a

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
alone plus the 8th block which is a

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:27.819 
alone plus the 8th block which is a
water<00:01:26.030> source<00:01:26.299> and<00:01:26.689> which<00:01:27.229> is<00:01:27.380> flowing<00:01:27.590> down

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
water source and which is flowing down

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:30.370 
water source and which is flowing down
um<00:01:28.149> gives<00:01:29.149> you<00:01:29.270> enough<00:01:29.479> momentum<00:01:29.689> to<00:01:29.929> shoot<00:01:30.259> up

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
um gives you enough momentum to shoot up

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.969 
um gives you enough momentum to shoot up
a<00:01:30.469> waterfall<00:01:30.859> and<00:01:31.420> dock<00:01:32.420> there<00:01:32.659> yeah<00:01:33.619> so

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
a waterfall and dock there yeah so

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.559 
a waterfall and dock there yeah so
that's<00:01:34.609> pretty<00:01:34.880> much<00:01:34.939> it<00:01:36.100> I'm<00:01:37.100> going<00:01:37.249> to<00:01:37.310> be

that's pretty much it I'm going to be

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:40.480 
that's pretty much it I'm going to be
explaining<00:01:38.569> how<00:01:38.929> to<00:01:38.990> make<00:01:39.380> it<00:01:39.409> in<00:01:39.740> the<00:01:40.039> next

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
explaining how to make it in the next

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:41.650 
explaining how to make it in the next
segment<00:01:40.759> so

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
segment so

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
stay tuned and that's the lane sea level

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.430 
stay tuned and that's the lane sea level
booked<00:01:45.390> on<00:01:45.540> which<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.290> now<00:01:46.410> retired<00:01:48.260> all<00:01:49.260> right

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.699 
and go outwards and you need it long
enough<00:04:15.269> so<00:04:15.630> that<00:04:15.660> the<00:04:16.109> water<00:04:16.320> will<00:04:16.470> flow

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
enough so that the water will flow

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.830 
enough so that the water will flow
toward<00:04:17.070> the<00:04:17.190> waterfall<00:04:17.579> who<00:04:18.269> won't<00:04:18.479> create<00:04:18.750> a

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
toward the waterfall who won't create a

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.140 
toward the waterfall who won't create a
current<00:04:19.139> with<00:04:19.260> it<00:04:19.440> I<00:04:19.620> actually<00:04:20.250> miscalculated

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
current with it I actually miscalculated

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.900 
current with it I actually miscalculated
here<00:04:21.329> I<00:04:21.359> needed<00:04:21.840> a<00:04:21.870> 1x<00:04:22.560> the<00:04:22.680> block<00:04:22.889> I'll<00:04:23.190> fix

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
here I needed a 1x the block I'll fix

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.450 
here I needed a 1x the block I'll fix
that<00:04:24.090> later<00:04:24.240> and<00:04:25.169> I'm<00:04:25.950> going<00:04:26.070> to<00:04:26.100> do<00:04:26.220> the<00:04:26.310> same

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
that later and I'm going to do the same

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.970 
that later and I'm going to do the same
thing<00:04:26.610> on<00:04:26.700> the<00:04:26.760> other<00:04:26.790> side

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.520 

all<00:04:32.520> right<00:04:32.670> now<00:04:32.880> you<00:04:32.940> want<00:04:33.210> to<00:04:33.360> delete<00:04:34.080> all<00:04:34.380> the

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
all right now you want to delete all the

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.100 
all right now you want to delete all the
water<00:04:34.710> in<00:04:35.070> this<00:04:35.910> area<00:04:36.300> so<00:04:36.360> i'm<00:04:36.810> going<00:04:36.900> to<00:04:36.960> use

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
water in this area so i'm going to use

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.190 
water in this area so i'm going to use
of<00:04:37.230> dirt<00:04:37.410> blocks<00:04:37.680> and<00:04:38.010> just<00:04:39.000> place<00:04:39.390> them<00:04:39.510> here

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.800 

this<00:04:43.200> will<00:04:43.410> actually<00:04:43.560> act<00:04:43.950> act<00:04:44.460> as<00:04:44.820> a<00:04:44.850> base<00:04:45.360> for

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
this will actually act act as a base for

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.370 
this will actually act act as a base for
the<00:04:46.020> current<00:04:46.940> so<00:04:47.940> the<00:04:48.420> water<00:04:48.600> can<00:04:48.690> flow<00:04:48.990> and

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
the current so the water can flow and

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.280 
the current so the water can flow and
doesn't<00:04:50.010> glitch<00:04:50.370> out<00:04:50.580> with<00:04:51.140> electric<00:04:52.140> motor

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
doesn't glitch out with electric motor

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.490 
doesn't glitch out with electric motor
physics<00:04:53.570> this<00:04:54.570> is<00:04:54.720> actually<00:04:55.050> deleting<00:04:55.410> the

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
physics this is actually deleting the

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.440 
physics this is actually deleting the
water<00:04:55.710> between<00:04:55.980> the<00:04:56.310> two<00:04:56.820> edges<00:04:57.000> of<00:04:57.330> the

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
water between the two edges of the

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.880 
water between the two edges of the
trough<00:04:59.390> to<00:05:00.390> leave<00:05:00.930> everything<00:05:01.110> up<00:05:01.440> to<00:05:01.470> the

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
trough to leave everything up to the

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.130 
trough to leave everything up to the
base<00:05:02.040> of<00:05:02.190> the<00:05:02.250> waterfall<00:05:02.640> like<00:05:02.820> that<00:05:03.110> now<00:05:04.110> you

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
base of the waterfall like that now you

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.640 
base of the waterfall like that now you
want<00:05:04.350> to<00:05:04.440> get<00:05:04.560> rid<00:05:04.680> of<00:05:04.740> all<00:05:04.860> the<00:05:04.980> dirt<00:05:05.160> and<00:05:06.650> what

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
want to get rid of all the dirt and what

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.550 
want to get rid of all the dirt and what
you<00:05:07.830> should<00:05:08.070> have<00:05:08.100> is<00:05:08.520> a<00:05:09.320> current<00:05:10.320> of<00:05:10.350> water

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
you should have is a current of water

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.310 
you should have is a current of water
floating<00:05:11.390> flowing<00:05:12.390> toward<00:05:13.350> the<00:05:13.530> waterfall

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 
floating flowing toward the waterfall

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.370 
floating flowing toward the waterfall
here<00:05:16.320> yeah<00:05:16.680> I<00:05:16.890> realized<00:05:17.400> I<00:05:17.490> miscalculated<00:05:18.380> I'm

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
here yeah I realized I miscalculated I'm

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.170 
here yeah I realized I miscalculated I'm
going<00:05:19.560> to<00:05:19.620> leave<00:05:19.740> the<00:05:19.860> source<00:05:20.100> block<00:05:20.370> and<00:05:20.730> make

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
going to leave the source block and make

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.860 
going to leave the source block and make
the<00:05:21.420> one<00:05:21.720> behind<00:05:21.870> it<00:05:22.200> a<00:05:22.380> source<00:05:22.740> long<00:05:23.030> then<00:05:24.030> fix

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
the one behind it a source long then fix

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.820 
the one behind it a source long then fix
up<00:05:25.020> the<00:05:25.110> base<00:05:25.260> so<00:05:25.590> that<00:05:25.620> the<00:05:25.860> water<00:05:25.980> flows<00:05:26.660> and

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
up the base so that the water flows and

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.230 
up the base so that the water flows and
that<00:05:28.830> is<00:05:29.100> the<00:05:29.310> configuration<00:05:29.490> you<00:05:30.090> should

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
that is the configuration you should

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.550 
that is the configuration you should
have<00:05:30.390> right<00:05:30.570> now<00:05:30.740> delete<00:05:31.740> all<00:05:31.920> the<00:05:32.040> dirts<00:05:32.250> and

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
have right now delete all the dirts and

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.720 
have right now delete all the dirts and
there<00:05:34.560> you<00:05:34.650> go<00:05:34.800> that<00:05:35.190> should<00:05:35.550> be<00:05:35.700> the

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:35.730 
there you go that should be the

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.570 
there you go that should be the
configuration<00:05:36.510> water<00:05:36.720> now<00:05:37.380> I<00:05:37.800> jumped<00:05:38.430> about

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
configuration water now I jumped about

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.270 
configuration water now I jumped about
to<00:05:38.760> where<00:05:39.360> I<00:05:39.390> get<00:05:39.570> a<00:05:39.600> boat<00:05:39.830> I'm<00:05:40.830> going<00:05:41.010> to<00:05:41.100> test

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
to where I get a boat I'm going to test

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.320 
to where I get a boat I'm going to test
it<00:05:41.460> and<00:05:41.610> yes<00:05:42.540> it<00:05:42.870> does<00:05:43.110> work<00:05:44.030> so<00:05:45.030> if<00:05:45.150> you<00:05:45.240> have

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
it and yes it does work so if you have

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.630 
it and yes it does work so if you have
