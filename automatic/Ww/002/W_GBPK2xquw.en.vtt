00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.590
 but then the heat of the day we could kill 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.480
 if we're still moroni maybe we can live on men leave 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.480
 only at night 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:14.739
 we have two options 

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:18.350
 we can construct increasingly elaborate artificial environments in our 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:22.619
 own planet we can not go to some other place after being a common prisoner 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.359
 that are destined to live in another part of our solar system if 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.420
 want to survive as a species we must find a new home 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.420
 especially when the water on the ground begins to disappear 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.310
 as the sun gets warmer 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.300
 the earth also gets warmer in an increasing amount of water if 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.430
 evaporates until all our oceans have disappeared 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.210
 and it is this disaster that will make life on earth impossible 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.149
 cotillard the impact the engine has dried up to three thousand years 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.190
 leaving only a flat editing surface 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.190
 a disturbing image of what is to come 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.080
 We received salary 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.660
 street vinicius 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.330
 it is as if we are on another planet and yet it is our planet 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.370
 and our whole planet will look like this 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.030
 made two passes will look alien too 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.130
 the blue and white planet covered by habilitation will have disappeared 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.560
 to be replaced by a planet that looks more like a martyr 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.079
 now we will have long been left to the neighborhood and leaving for another 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:47.509
 planet mere spectators than the show that will do next only the inter 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.850
 goes from yellow to red 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.320
 it is transforming itself from what astronomers call a fictitious 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.110
 red 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.850
 an old star entering the last stage of her life 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.440
 it fills your whole daytime 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.580
 the atmosphere has disappeared and it is as if it looked at flights into space 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.689
 It's almost six and a half 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.739
 billions of years into the future 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.230
 in mato grosso do sul 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.429
 we are approaching twilight 

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:16.949
 although the show is now an adult he is more active than ever 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.479
 now only use the rest of your hydrogen fuel from your 

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:25.709
 it is burning helium that leaves it more and more hot the energy that 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.969
 radiates from the superheated core 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:32.459
 pushes the upper layers of the sun outwards making it larger as it 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.299
 grow the surface gradually cools becoming more reddish 

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:42.099
 although the outer layers of the sun this game cooling the show is 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.519
 approaching us through the systems of the sea 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.859
 and just as when we approach a bonfire the earth will dry more and more 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:52.769
 the heat of the sun 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.000
 bush when he only turns into a red giant he is actually in 

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:59.959
 a dangerous phase for the planet as the earth is a very trying phase to jump 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.620
 because it becomes much brighter much bigger 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.939
 but his cadore on Thursday 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:08.869
 so now the surface of the earth has already melted for a long time 

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:13.089
 but the worst was to come as the sun became increasingly unstable 

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:18.809
 violent thermal pulsations of heat mean that the sun is in surpassing 

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:19.790
 activity 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.099
 its diameter is thousands of times larger 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.989
 we lose some of these accusations it expands to basically the size of the 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.129
 earth orbit 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:30.969
 and it will impose this internal prices 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:32.849
 everything in your way will be 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:37.479
 to start the first dive will burn like gigantic meteor 

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:39.239
 we want to zero the liability 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:40.959
 but that the earth 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.959
 will be that the place that sheltered them for billions of years will suffer the same 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.169
 fate of its neighbors 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:51.870
 the measure of heat waves through a show he drops 1 billion and more 

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:54.279
 millions of tons of material in space 

00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:57.399
 are ongoing gravitational pine teacher 

00:03:57.399 --> 00:04:01.799
 This can allow the earth to move away from the sun and not 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:05.189
 but scientists are not sure 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:08.110
 and even though the storm has a burning child 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.110
 she will now be an unrecognizable planet verdict 

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:15.549
 It's close to six in the afternoon. 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:17.859
 twilight on our sun watch 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.859
 and the life of the sun like a star in the chest and arrived 

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:26.779
 but it is not big enough to explode and become a supernova 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.320
 just about stars more than eight times the mass of our planet explodes 

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:36.649
 in the end he shrinks into a white dwarf living by hundreds 

00:04:36.649 --> 00:04:41.029
 of billions of years but producing only a weak glow then it is so 

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:46.689
 that the show turned out not to be an explosion but with a lament the portion 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:50.919
 wonderful that has provided you with warmth for billions of years 

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:56.139
 will end with a small star no bigger than the land the soldiers gave life 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.920
 with his death all life on earth will have disappeared if humans still 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:04.520
 there will be somewhere and three stars 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.320
 therefore 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.889
 next time they are on a beach enjoying the show remember him 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:13.889
 it will not last forever 

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:21.029
 the Brazilian federation without a total 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:26.189
 the moment 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:27.040
 not
