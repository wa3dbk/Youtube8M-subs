goals<00:02:21.870> are<00:02:21.990> much<00:02:22.170> beyond<00:02:22.500> that<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:23.540> really

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
goals are much beyond that and I really

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.000 
goals are much beyond that and I really
really<00:02:24.870> did<00:02:24.990> hope<00:02:25.170> that<00:02:25.410> I<00:02:25.440> would<00:02:25.530> make<00:02:25.740> around

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
really did hope that I would make around

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.760 
really did hope that I would make around
like<00:02:26.160> 300<00:02:26.880> 200<00:02:27.750> grand<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:27.959> year<00:02:27.990> from<00:02:28.260> Starcraft

like 300 200 grand a year from Starcraft
and<00:02:29.070> I<00:02:30.440> guess<00:02:31.440> unfortunately<00:02:31.590> I<00:02:31.950> just<00:02:32.100> wasn't

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
and I guess unfortunately I just wasn't

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.190 
and I guess unfortunately I just wasn't
recognized<00:02:32.790> as<00:02:33.120> much<00:02:33.480> as<00:02:33.630> i<00:02:33.720> would<00:02:33.780> have<00:02:33.900> liked

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
recognized as much as i would have liked

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.910 
recognized as much as i would have liked
or<00:02:34.500> I<00:02:34.530> would<00:02:34.740> have<00:02:34.770> hoped<00:02:34.980> um<00:02:36.440> the<00:02:37.440> final<00:02:37.800> and

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
or I would have hoped um the final and

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.520 
or I would have hoped um the final and
biggest<00:02:38.280> reason<00:02:38.640> um<00:02:38.940> I<00:02:39.570> decided<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.290> quit

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
biggest reason um I decided to quit

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.140 
biggest reason um I decided to quit
which<00:02:40.890> is<00:02:41.040> kind<00:02:41.250> of<00:02:41.340> relative<00:02:41.580> to<00:02:41.850> previous

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
which is kind of relative to previous

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.050 
which is kind of relative to previous
reason<00:02:42.620> was<00:02:43.620> because<00:02:43.830> I<00:02:44.070> really<00:02:44.340> I<00:02:44.610> always

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
reason was because I really I always

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.330 
reason was because I really I always
hoped<00:02:45.540> that<00:02:45.840> I<00:02:46.260> would<00:02:46.530> eventually<00:02:47.100> be

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
hoped that I would eventually be

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.220 
hoped that I would eventually be
recognized<00:02:47.910> as<00:02:48.209> a<00:02:48.239> person<00:02:48.660> who<00:02:48.810> changed<00:02:49.140> my
