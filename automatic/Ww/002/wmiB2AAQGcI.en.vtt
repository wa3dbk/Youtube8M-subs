00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
that time he would have mastered out

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.560 
that time he would have mastered out
wide<00:01:44.710> array<00:01:45.009> of<00:01:45.040> jutsu<00:01:45.640> that's<00:01:46.299> one<00:01:46.420> of<00:01:46.509> the

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
wide array of jutsu that's one of the

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.380 
wide array of jutsu that's one of the
requirements<00:01:46.810> are<00:01:47.140> becoming<00:01:47.469> Hokage<00:01:48.360> what<00:01:49.360> I

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
requirements are becoming Hokage what I

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.560 
requirements are becoming Hokage what I
also<00:01:49.659> think<00:01:50.259> is<00:01:50.530> that<00:01:50.969> naruto<00:01:51.969> is<00:01:52.180> going<00:01:52.479> to

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
also think is that naruto is going to

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.899 
also think is that naruto is going to
become<00:01:52.659> the<00:01:52.810> Hokage<00:01:53.280> there<00:01:54.280> are<00:01:54.369> many<00:01:54.490> signs

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
become the Hokage there are many signs

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.209 
become the Hokage there are many signs
that<00:01:55.149> he<00:01:55.299> must<00:01:55.899> become<00:01:56.229> the<00:01:56.259> Hokage<00:01:56.500> because

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:57.219 
that he must become the Hokage because

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:59.459 
that he must become the Hokage because
not<00:01:58.060> only<00:01:58.090> as<00:01:58.420> he<00:01:58.539> mastered<00:01:58.899> a<00:01:58.960> wide<00:01:59.170> array<00:01:59.320> of

00:01:59.459 --> 00:01:59.469 
not only as he mastered a wide array of

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:02.789 
not only as he mastered a wide array of
jutsu<00:02:00.039> but<00:02:00.479> Naruto<00:02:01.479> also<00:02:01.869> qualifies<00:02:02.380> being

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
jutsu but Naruto also qualifies being

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.219 
jutsu but Naruto also qualifies being
