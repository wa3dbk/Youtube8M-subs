hours<00:01:24.479> which<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.720> draw<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.799> string<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.220> is

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
hours which to draw the string this is

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.280 
hours which to draw the string this is
biodegradable<00:01:26.820> twine<00:01:27.450> which<00:01:27.750> will<00:01:28.049> probably

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
biodegradable twine which will probably

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.020

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
get rekt if it gets wet but hopefully it

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.740 
get rekt if it gets wet but hopefully it
won't<00:01:30.180> get<00:01:30.299> wet<00:01:30.479> um<00:01:31.380> this<00:01:32.130> is<00:01:32.340> actually<00:01:32.750> upside
