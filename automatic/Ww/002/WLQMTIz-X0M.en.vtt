components of a system if you want to
receive<00:00:26.060> satellite<00:00:27.060> signals<00:00:27.570> on<00:00:27.990> your<00:00:28.230> TV

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
receive satellite signals on your TV

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.209 
receive satellite signals on your TV
either<00:00:29.750> three<00:00:30.750> channels<00:00:31.590> or<00:00:32.210> paid<00:00:33.210> charts<00:00:34.219> the

either three channels or paid charts the
main<00:00:35.430> things<00:00:35.730> are<00:00:36.030> very<00:00:36.239> simple<00:00:36.630> I<00:00:36.930> will<00:00:37.230> see

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
main things are very simple I will see

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.930 
main things are very simple I will see
in<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:38.309> series<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.780> short<00:00:40.290> videos<00:00:40.940> so

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
in this series of of short videos so

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.200 
in this series of of short videos so
what<00:00:42.750> are<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.079> main<00:00:43.230> components<00:00:43.860> if<00:00:44.520> we<00:00:45.030> want

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
what are the main components if we want

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.260 
what are the main components if we want
to<00:00:45.329> summarize<00:00:45.680> we<00:00:46.680> have<00:00:46.829> first<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.879> signal

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
to summarize we have first the signal

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.290 
to summarize we have first the signal
will<00:00:49.260> be<00:00:49.410> sent<00:00:49.440> by<00:00:49.829> from<00:00:50.489> somewhere<00:00:50.969> in<00:00:51.180> the

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
will be sent by from somewhere in the

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.889 
will be sent by from somewhere in the
sky<00:00:51.680> will<00:00:52.680> be<00:00:52.829> sent<00:00:55.520> to<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.670> satellite<00:00:57.149> dish

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
sky will be sent to the satellite dish

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.819 
sky will be sent to the satellite dish
and<00:00:58.579> the<00:00:59.579> dish<00:00:59.789> will<00:01:00.539> concentrate<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.379> signal

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
and the dish will concentrate the signal

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.840 
and the dish will concentrate the signal
and<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:03.000> signal<00:01:03.030> will<00:01:03.570> be<00:01:03.719> collected<00:01:04.350> then<00:01:04.850> by

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
and the signal will be collected then by

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.510 
and the signal will be collected then by
the<00:01:06.780> lnb<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.850> lnb<00:01:09.270> will<00:01:09.479> send<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.140> the

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
the lnb and the lnb will send it to the

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.630 
the lnb and the lnb will send it to the
decoder<00:01:11.520> or<00:01:11.880> satellite<00:01:12.750> receiver<00:01:13.490> from<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
decoder or satellite receiver from the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.770 
decoder or satellite receiver from the
decoder<00:01:15.350> then<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.740> take<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.159> signal<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:18.570> is

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
decoder then you take the signal that is

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.160 
decoder then you take the signal that is
decoded<00:01:19.320> now<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:20.070> get<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.430> picture<00:01:21.170> movies

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
decoded now you get the picture movies

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.469 
decoded now you get the picture movies
music<00:01:23.420> to<00:01:24.420> your<00:01:24.570> TV<00:01:24.920> either<00:01:25.920> by<00:01:26.340> this

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
music to your TV either by this

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.230 
music to your TV either by this
audio/video<00:01:27.479> cable<00:01:27.930> or<00:01:28.110> by<00:01:28.439> H<00:01:28.680> HDMI<00:01:29.579> cable<00:01:30.030> or

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
audio/video cable or by H HDMI cable or

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.210 
audio/video cable or by H HDMI cable or
other<00:01:30.960> type<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.350> cables<00:01:32.659> now<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:34.290> we<00:01:35.009> have

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
other type of cables now that we have

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.940 
other type of cables now that we have
seen<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.820> main<00:01:36.000> components<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:36.990> would

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
seen the main components I would

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.050 
seen the main components I would
strongly<00:01:38.850> suggest<00:01:39.240> for<00:01:40.369> working<00:01:41.369> with

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
strongly suggest for working with

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.780 
strongly suggest for working with
different<00:01:42.659> elements<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.590> have<00:01:43.829> at<00:01:44.729> least

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
different elements to have at least

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.370 
different elements to have at least
these<00:01:45.240> four<00:01:45.659> keys<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.920> have<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.159> cutter<00:01:48.380> you

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
these four keys you have a cutter you

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.609 
these four keys you have a cutter you
have<00:01:49.649> this<00:01:49.920> tool<00:01:50.700> also<00:01:51.180> for<00:01:51.570> cutting<00:01:52.079> the

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
have this tool also for cutting the

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.060 
have this tool also for cutting the
wires<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.600> you<00:01:54.600> have<00:01:54.810> these<00:01:54.990> two<00:01:55.229> pieces<00:01:55.560> this

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
wires and you have these two pieces this

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.469 
wires and you have these two pieces this
is<00:01:56.310> key<00:01:56.700> number<00:01:57.420> 10<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.219> this<00:01:59.219> is<00:01:59.460> key<00:01:59.729> number

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
is key number 10 and this is key number
