00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
defend its position the average Chinese

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.110 
defend its position the average Chinese
person<00:02:22.319> is<00:02:22.410> responsible<00:02:23.100> for<00:02:23.130> just<00:02:23.640> three<00:02:24.000> and

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
a half tons of carbon a year so we

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.400 
a half tons of carbon a year so we
represent<00:02:26.640> that<00:02:26.670> here<00:02:27.000> with<00:02:27.630> one<00:02:27.959> bowl<00:02:28.200> of

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
carbon so we represent that with three

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.920 
carbon so we represent that with three
bowls<00:02:37.530> of<00:02:37.799> rice<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.340> China's<00:02:39.239> punchline<00:02:39.690> is

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:40.400 
bowls of rice and China's punchline is
this

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
this

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.070
