we decided to introduce listening

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.820 
we decided to introduce listening

therapy at green packed school because

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.700 
therapy at green packed school because
we<00:00:20.010> wanted<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.900> program<00:00:21.900> that<00:00:22.110> was<00:00:22.290> going<00:00:22.680> to

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
we wanted a program that was going to

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.280 
we wanted a program that was going to
address<00:00:23.130> some<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:23.849> the<00:00:24.090> gaps<00:00:24.390> that<00:00:25.020> weren't

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.410 
being addressed in children's learning
we<00:00:28.260> wanted<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.590> program<00:00:29.070> that<00:00:29.670> was<00:00:29.910> going<00:00:30.390> to

other programs learning together we
needed<00:00:38.129> something<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.489> was<00:00:38.670> going<00:00:38.879> to

needed something that was going to

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.210 
needed something that was going to
address<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.680> connection<00:00:40.680> between<00:00:40.890> what

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.470 
and some of the programs that we were

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.469 
and some of the programs that we were
putting<00:00:58.799> in<00:00:59.010> place<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.489> we<00:00:59.850> wanted<00:01:00.089> to<00:01:00.150> try

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:00.479 
putting in place and we wanted to try

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:01.939 
putting in place and we wanted to try
and<00:01:00.540> make<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.839> connection<00:01:01.229> and<00:01:01.440> make<00:01:01.589> a<00:01:01.620> link

and make a connection and make a link
and<00:01:02.100> we<00:01:02.640> felt<00:01:02.909> that<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.510> information<00:01:04.110> that

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
and we felt that the information that

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.230 
and we felt that the information that
would<00:01:04.409> read<00:01:04.559> about<00:01:04.769> sound<00:01:05.100> therapy<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:06.090> what

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
would read about sound therapy and what

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.289 
would read about sound therapy and what
we've<00:01:06.390> heard<00:01:06.570> about<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:07.130> was<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.549> was<00:01:09.270> a

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
we've heard about it was that it was a

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.680 
we've heard about it was that it was a
program<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:10.580> unlocked<00:01:12.260> some<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.409> those

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
program that unlocked some of those

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.300 
program that unlocked some of those
parts<00:01:15.690> of<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.900> brain<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.470> had<00:01:16.920> been<00:01:17.100> locked

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
parts of the brain that had been locked

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.630 
parts of the brain that had been locked
up<00:01:17.460> previously<00:01:18.030> which<00:01:18.859> had<00:01:19.859> a<00:01:19.890> direct

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
up previously which had a direct

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.109 
up previously which had a direct
correlation<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.240> children's<00:01:21.689> learning<00:01:21.869> and

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
correlation to children's learning and

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.399 
correlation to children's learning and
particularly<00:01:24.119> with<00:01:24.270> listening<00:01:24.630> with<00:01:25.229> being

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
particularly with listening with being

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.289 
particularly with listening with being
able<00:01:25.469> to<00:01:25.619> focus<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.340> began<00:01:26.700> were<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.909> use<00:01:27.149> the

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
able to focus and began were to use the

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.270 
able to focus and began were to use the
information<00:01:27.509> they<00:01:27.960> were<00:01:28.079> given<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.439> apply

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
information they were given to apply

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.370 
information they were given to apply
what<00:01:29.520> they<00:01:29.640> were<00:01:29.700> doing<00:01:29.939> into<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.840> classroom

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
what they were doing into the classroom

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.020 
what they were doing into the classroom
hints<00:01:33.049> progress<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.259> reading<00:01:34.859> and<00:01:35.030> whole

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.510 
literacy and numeracy as well done
certainly<00:01:38.939> we've<00:01:39.179> been<00:01:39.329> able<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.689> see

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
certainly we've been able to see

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.590 
certainly we've been able to see
reinforcement<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.579> that<00:01:41.789> but<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.090> does<00:01:42.299> bring

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
reinforcement of that but it does bring

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.959 
reinforcement of that but it does bring
many<00:01:43.469> programs<00:01:43.920> together<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.520> benefits

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:44.969 
many programs together and the benefits

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:48.340 
many programs together and the benefits
are<00:01:45.149> wider<00:01:45.450> than<00:01:45.689> just<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.649> behavioral<00:01:47.189> and

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
are wider than just the behavioral and

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.739 
are wider than just the behavioral and
concentration<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.700> listening<00:01:50.700> skills<00:01:50.939> that

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:51.749 
concentration and listening skills that

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:53.389 
concentration and listening skills that
children<00:01:52.170> get<00:01:52.560> from<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.829> program<00:01:53.189> the

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
children get from the program the

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.910 
children get from the program the
program<00:01:54.179> has<00:01:54.570> been<00:01:54.600> very<00:01:55.049> very<00:01:55.409> easy<00:01:55.679> to

of our children who are below average
I'd<00:07:22.000> recommend<00:07:22.360> that<00:07:22.599> other<00:07:22.780> schools

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:26.050 
certainly have listening skills therapy

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.839 
certainly have listening skills therapy
programs<00:07:26.580> because<00:07:27.630> you<00:07:28.630> want<00:07:28.840> to<00:07:28.900> target<00:07:29.289> and

00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:29.849 
programs because you want to target and

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:31.800 
programs because you want to target and
provide<00:07:30.849> the<00:07:31.000> children<00:07:31.389> of<00:07:31.449> every

some<00:07:36.820> of<00:07:37.090> the<00:07:37.360> things<00:07:37.630> that<00:07:37.780> they<00:07:38.169> may<00:07:38.469> have

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:38.620 
some of the things that they may have

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.010 
some of the things that they may have
missed<00:07:38.800> out<00:07:38.979> on<00:07:39.039> and<00:07:39.490> their<00:07:39.669> early<00:07:40.570> years<00:07:40.599> or
