so I've been trying to think of what I'm
going<00:00:11.400> to<00:00:11.519> call<00:00:11.759> my<00:00:12.059> my<00:00:12.929> video<00:00:13.200> series<00:00:13.670> I<00:00:14.670> don't

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
anything because it isn't really a let's

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.590 
anything because it isn't really a let's
play<00:00:18.840> series<00:00:21.050> so<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:23.039> think<00:00:23.430> what<00:00:23.789> I<00:00:23.820> am<00:00:24.000> going

wasn't really hard in the first place a

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.760 
wasn't really hard in the first place a
lot<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.090> his<00:01:27.180> defenses<00:01:27.840> weren't<00:01:28.200> upgraded

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.310 
lot of his defenses weren't upgraded
really<00:01:29.450> but<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.479> just<00:01:30.659> started<00:01:30.810> down<00:01:31.049> here<00:01:31.079> in

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
really but I just started down here in

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.660 
really but I just started down here in
the<00:01:31.409> bottom<00:01:31.530> with<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.829> Giants<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.369> get<00:01:32.520> rid<00:01:32.610> of

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
the bottom with the Giants to get rid of

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.179 
the bottom with the Giants to get rid of
the<00:01:32.759> air<00:01:32.880> defense<00:01:33.770> thankfully<00:01:34.770> he<00:01:34.829> only<00:01:35.040> had

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
the air defense thankfully he only had

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.149 
the air defense thankfully he only had
one<00:01:35.340> air<00:01:35.610> defense<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:36.380> that<00:01:37.380> wasn't<00:01:37.710> bad<00:01:37.829> I

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
one air defense so that wasn't bad I

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.520 
one air defense so that wasn't bad I
think<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:38.909> totally<00:01:39.270> forgot<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.930> check<00:01:40.350> the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
think I totally forgot to check the

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.789 
think I totally forgot to check the
corners<00:01:40.860> on<00:01:40.979> this<00:01:41.100> one<00:01:41.250> yeah<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.460> did

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
corners on this one yeah I did

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.249 
corners on this one yeah I did
but<00:01:43.799> not<00:01:44.220> any<00:01:44.399> rate<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:45.149> my<00:01:45.600> Giants<00:01:45.990> go<00:01:46.110> in

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
but not any rate so my Giants go in

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.510 
but not any rate so my Giants go in
there<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.439> dropped<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.860> healer<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.159> little<00:01:47.399> bit

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
there I dropped the healer a little bit

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.740 
there I dropped the healer a little bit
early<00:01:47.790> because<00:01:47.909> my<00:01:48.090> Giants<00:01:48.450> were<00:01:48.509> already

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
early because my Giants were already

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.399 
early because my Giants were already
losing<00:01:50.149> but<00:01:51.149> thankfully<00:01:51.810> they<00:01:51.930> took<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.290> out

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
losing but thankfully they took it out

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.160 
losing but thankfully they took it out
before<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.860> healer<00:01:53.130> died<00:01:53.720> so<00:01:54.720> he<00:01:54.840> brought<00:01:55.049> him

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
before the healer died so he brought him

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.280 
before the healer died so he brought him
back<00:01:55.350> up<00:01:56.390> now<00:01:58.219> on<00:01:59.219> this<00:01:59.729> base<00:01:59.969> pretty<00:02:00.689> much<00:02:00.930> all

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
back up now on this base pretty much all

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.780 
back up now on this base pretty much all
the<00:02:01.770> storages<00:02:02.460> are<00:02:03.619> full<00:02:04.619> not<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.369> storages

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
the storages are full not the storages

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.169 
the storages are full not the storages
the<00:02:06.060> collectors<00:02:06.860> so<00:02:07.860> I<00:02:07.890> wasn't<00:02:08.369> really<00:02:08.940> trying

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
the collectors so I wasn't really trying

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.440 
the collectors so I wasn't really trying

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
to raid this it was more of a test with

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.760 
to raid this it was more of a test with
just<00:02:12.660> a<00:02:12.750> dragon<00:02:13.140> but<00:02:13.319> I<00:02:13.379> mean<00:02:13.590> if

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
just a dragon but I mean if

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.260 
just a dragon but I mean if
just<00:02:14.010> had<00:02:14.130> a<00:02:14.160> bunch<00:02:14.370> of<00:02:14.460> goblins<00:02:14.880> I<00:02:14.970> could<00:02:15.150> have

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
just had a bunch of goblins I could have

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.930 
just had a bunch of goblins I could have
cleared<00:02:15.480> him<00:02:15.660> out<00:02:15.780> in<00:02:16.550> probably<00:02:17.550> out<00:02:17.760> of<00:02:17.790> the

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
cleared him out in probably out of the

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.060 
cleared him out in probably out of the
thirty<00:02:18.930> seconds<00:02:19.440> or<00:02:19.500> something<00:02:19.680> on<00:02:19.950> either

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
thirty seconds or something on either

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.610 
thirty seconds or something on either
side<00:02:20.690> but<00:02:21.690> again<00:02:21.810> this<00:02:22.080> was<00:02:22.260> just<00:02:22.470> my<00:02:22.560> first

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
side but again this was just my first

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.290 
side but again this was just my first
usage<00:02:23.280> with<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:24.080> dragon<00:02:25.940> he's<00:02:26.940> going<00:02:27.180> around

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
usage with the dragon he's going around

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.480 
usage with the dragon he's going around

cool<00:03:02.130> you<00:03:02.460> know<00:03:02.580> I've<00:03:02.760> been<00:03:03.090> attacked<00:03:03.570> by

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
cool you know I've been attacked by

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.930 
cool you know I've been attacked by
dragons<00:03:04.200> so<00:03:04.500> I'm<00:03:04.950> kind<00:03:05.280> of<00:03:05.340> seeing<00:03:05.580> how<00:03:05.730> people

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
dragons so I'm kind of seeing how people

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.640 
dragons so I'm kind of seeing how people
have<00:03:06.330> done<00:03:06.480> it<00:03:06.570> effectively<00:03:07.050> in<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.320> past<00:03:07.610> I

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
have done it effectively in the past I

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.050 
have done it effectively in the past I
just<00:03:10.650> know<00:03:10.950> it's<00:03:11.100> important<00:03:11.460> to<00:03:11.520> get<00:03:11.730> rid<00:03:11.880> of

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
just know it's important to get rid of

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.730 
just know it's important to get rid of
any<00:03:12.600> kind<00:03:13.050> of<00:03:13.550> air<00:03:14.550> defense<00:03:15.470> which<00:03:16.470> is<00:03:16.500> the

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
any kind of air defense which is the

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.940 
any kind of air defense which is the
same<00:03:16.920> with<00:03:17.130> healers<00:03:17.460> and<00:03:17.610> everything<00:03:17.970> so<00:03:18.950> yeah

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
same with healers and everything so yeah

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.330 
same with healers and everything so yeah
I<00:03:20.160> think<00:03:20.250> that<00:03:20.430> it<00:03:20.700> went<00:03:21.050> pretty<00:03:22.050> well<00:03:22.230> it<00:03:23.220> was

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
I think that it went pretty well it was

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.949 
I think that it went pretty well it was
an<00:03:23.430> earlier<00:03:23.730> raid<00:03:24.060> in<00:03:24.270> the<00:03:24.330> morning<00:03:24.720> so

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
an earlier raid in the morning so

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.360 
an earlier raid in the morning so
thankfully<00:03:25.950> this<00:03:26.190> guy<00:03:26.690> wasn't<00:03:27.690> online<00:03:27.980> so<00:03:28.980> I

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
thankfully this guy wasn't online so I

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.500 
thankfully this guy wasn't online so I
was<00:03:29.520> able<00:03:29.670> to<00:03:29.850> go<00:03:30.030> and<00:03:30.420> I<00:03:31.940> was<00:03:32.940> able<00:03:33.030> to<00:03:33.180> go<00:03:33.330> and

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
was able to go and I was able to go and

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.840 
was able to go and I was able to go and
take<00:03:33.750> all<00:03:34.650> this<00:03:34.950> stuff<00:03:35.010> from<00:03:35.340> him<00:03:35.520> but<00:03:35.640> that

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.360 
take all this stuff from him but that
one<00:03:36.090> had<00:03:36.330> two<00:03:36.660> dragons<00:03:37.170> because<00:03:37.590> I<00:03:37.800> queued<00:03:38.280> up

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
one had two dragons because I queued up

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.510 
one had two dragons because I queued up
to<00:03:38.430> last<00:03:38.820> night<00:03:39.090> before<00:03:39.240> I<00:03:39.390> went<00:03:39.510> to<00:03:39.600> bed

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
to last night before I went to bed

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.940 
to last night before I went to bed
this<00:03:42.150> one<00:03:42.360> right<00:03:42.540> here<00:03:42.600> only<00:03:43.020> has<00:03:43.260> one<00:03:43.470> dragon

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
this one right here only has one dragon

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.030 
this one right here only has one dragon
it<00:03:44.220> has<00:03:44.970> more<00:03:45.180> Giants<00:03:45.420> I<00:03:45.660> believe<00:03:45.959> this<00:03:46.860> base

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
it has more Giants I believe this base

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.830 
it has more Giants I believe this base
is<00:03:47.220> a<00:03:47.250> little<00:03:47.580> better<00:03:47.790> however<00:03:48.120> some<00:03:48.660> of<00:03:48.690> his

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
is a little better however some of his

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.080 
is a little better however some of his
defenses<00:03:49.380> still<00:03:50.040> aren't<00:03:50.220> upgraded<00:03:50.700> that<00:03:50.820> much

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
defenses still aren't upgraded that much

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.540 
defenses still aren't upgraded that much
like<00:03:51.570> starter<00:03:52.560> tower<00:03:52.770> this<00:03:53.100> Archer<00:03:53.459> tower<00:03:55.550> and

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
like starter tower this Archer tower and

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.460 
like starter tower this Archer tower and
this<00:03:57.000> mortars<00:03:57.390> pretty<00:03:57.630> low<00:04:00.020> but<00:04:01.020> yeah<00:04:01.170> so<00:04:01.440> I

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
this mortars pretty low but yeah so I

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.630 
this mortars pretty low but yeah so I
started<00:04:01.560> off<00:04:01.860> doing<00:04:01.920> the<00:04:02.160> same<00:04:02.310> thing<00:04:02.520> with

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
started off doing the same thing with

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.670 
started off doing the same thing with
this<00:04:02.790> my<00:04:03.030> Giants<00:04:03.420> decided<00:04:03.780> to<00:04:03.840> split<00:04:04.200> up<00:04:04.380> which

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
this my Giants decided to split up which

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:11.270 
this my Giants decided to split up which
is<00:04:05.340> annoying<00:04:08.720> but<00:04:09.720> yeah<00:04:09.840> so<00:04:10.260> they're<00:04:11.070> just

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
is annoying but yeah so they're just

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.710 
is annoying but yeah so they're just
going<00:04:11.400> in<00:04:11.640> there<00:04:11.880> doing<00:04:12.030> their<00:04:12.180> thing

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
going in there doing their thing

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.600 
going in there doing their thing
I<00:04:12.750> dropped<00:04:13.320> the<00:04:13.440> dragon<00:04:13.860> now<00:04:14.010> that<00:04:14.220> all<00:04:14.370> the

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
I dropped the dragon now that all the

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.789 
I dropped the dragon now that all the
air<00:04:15.600> defense<00:04:16.020> and<00:04:16.169> everything<00:04:16.530> is<00:04:16.620> pretty

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
air defense and everything is pretty

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.500 
air defense and everything is pretty
much<00:04:16.980> down<00:04:17.250> he's<00:04:18.030> doing<00:04:18.330> his<00:04:18.450> work<00:04:18.480> I<00:04:20.510> drop

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
much down he's doing his work I drop

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.030 
much down he's doing his work I drop
these<00:04:21.660> archers<00:04:21.989> down<00:04:22.200> up<00:04:22.380> here<00:04:22.560> to<00:04:22.710> try<00:04:22.890> and

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
these archers down up here to try and

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.969 
these archers down up here to try and
distract<00:04:23.310> this<00:04:23.490> Archer<00:04:23.850> tower<00:04:24.860> from<00:04:25.860> the

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
distract this Archer tower from the

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.110 
distract this Archer tower from the
dragon

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
dragon

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.240 
dragon
but<00:04:27.270> I<00:04:27.600> think<00:04:27.990> the<00:04:28.199> dragon<00:04:28.530> focuses<00:04:28.979> on<00:04:29.100> it

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
but I think the dragon focuses on it

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.370 
but I think the dragon focuses on it

blast<00:04:50.120> but<00:04:51.120> we<00:04:51.479> are<00:04:51.979> running<00:04:52.979> the<00:04:53.250> clock<00:04:53.490> down

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
blast but we are running the clock down

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.200 
blast but we are running the clock down
and<00:04:54.660> just<00:04:55.530> moving<00:04:56.280> our<00:04:56.460> way<00:04:56.490> around<00:04:56.910> there's<00:04:57.150> a

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
and just moving our way around there's a

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.360 
and just moving our way around there's a
little<00:04:57.510> bit<00:04:57.630> of<00:04:57.720> gold<00:04:57.900> left<00:04:58.199> in<00:04:58.680> this<00:04:59.010> storage

right<00:04:59.699> here<00:05:00.060> I<00:05:00.090> think<00:05:00.180> there<00:05:00.660> was<00:05:00.780> like<00:05:00.930> I

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
right here I think there was like I

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.400 
right here I think there was like I
don't<00:05:01.560> know<00:05:01.770> 20,000<00:05:02.460> left<00:05:02.639> or<00:05:02.789> something<00:05:03.410> the
