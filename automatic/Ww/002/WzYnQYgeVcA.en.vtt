different<00:02:52.310> haircuts<00:02:52.910> because<00:02:53.299> kind<00:02:53.959> of<00:02:54.019> look

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
different haircuts because kind of look

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.660

like<00:02:54.170> she<00:02:54.799> even<00:02:54.950> said<00:02:55.100> it<00:02:55.220> looks<00:02:55.340> like<00:02:55.459> two

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
like she even said it looks like two

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.690 
like she even said it looks like two
different<00:02:55.790> haircuts<00:02:56.299> before<00:02:57.280> I'm<00:02:58.280> hoping

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
different haircuts before I'm hoping

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.160 
different haircuts before I'm hoping
maybe<00:02:58.850> I<00:02:59.000> can<00:02:59.209> make<00:02:59.329> it<00:02:59.450> look<00:02:59.630> a<00:02:59.660> little<00:02:59.959> bit

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
maybe I can make it look a little bit

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.440 
maybe I can make it look a little bit
more<00:03:00.380> together<00:03:00.829> which<00:03:01.549> would<00:03:01.730> make<00:03:01.970> it<00:03:02.090> easier

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
more together which would make it easier

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.849 
more together which would make it easier
for<00:03:02.480> like<00:03:02.810> going<00:03:02.959> to<00:03:03.079> the<00:03:03.200> gym<00:03:03.230> and<00:03:03.590> stuff<00:03:03.709> like

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:03.859 
for like going to the gym and stuff like

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:06.690 
for like going to the gym and stuff like
that<00:03:04.070> but<00:03:04.640> if<00:03:04.760> not<00:03:04.970> that's<00:03:05.390> fine<00:03:05.510> too

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
that but if not that's fine too

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.330 
that but if not that's fine too
so<00:03:07.700> that<00:03:08.630> better<00:03:08.840> lighting<00:03:09.230> before<00:03:09.380> and<00:03:09.950> I<00:03:10.130> was

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
so that better lighting before and I was

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.340 
so that better lighting before and I was
going<00:03:10.549> to<00:03:10.609> show<00:03:10.820> you<00:03:10.880> it's<00:03:11.810> not<00:03:11.989> this<00:03:12.140> is<00:03:12.230> not

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
going to show you it's not this is not

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.400 
going to show you it's not this is not
great<00:03:12.470> lighting<00:03:13.480> what<00:03:14.480> this<00:03:14.810> is

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
great lighting what this is

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.150 
great lighting what this is
anja<00:03:16.280> the<00:03:16.670> color<00:03:17.350> how<00:03:18.350> it<00:03:18.380> lightened<00:03:18.890> up<00:03:18.950> over

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
anja the color how it lightened up over

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.860 
anja the color how it lightened up over
the<00:03:19.280> last<00:03:19.430> year<00:03:19.760> a<00:03:19.940> lot<00:03:20.329> of<00:03:20.359> people<00:03:20.420> asked

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
the last year a lot of people asked

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.699 
the last year a lot of people asked
about<00:03:21.140> how<00:03:21.410> light<00:03:21.890> the<00:03:22.130> way<00:03:22.250> it<00:03:22.310> scattered

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
about how light the way it scattered

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.500 
about how light the way it scattered
it's<00:03:24.709> not<00:03:24.920> showing<00:03:25.220> it's<00:03:25.459> it's<00:03:25.790> close<00:03:26.090> this<00:03:26.329> is

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
it's not showing it's it's close this is

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:27.990 
it's not showing it's it's close this is
I<00:03:26.540> think<00:03:26.750> this<00:03:27.019> is<00:03:27.140> a<00:03:27.170> pretty<00:03:27.380> close

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
I think this is a pretty close

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.069 
I think this is a pretty close
representation<00:03:29.000> of<00:03:29.060> how<00:03:29.180> she<00:03:29.239> looks<00:03:29.600> but<00:03:29.810> a

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
representation of how she looks but a

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.020 
representation of how she looks but a
little<00:03:30.260> bit<00:03:30.440> lighter<00:03:30.590> look<00:03:31.310> it's<00:03:31.730> looking<00:03:32.000> a

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
little bit lighter look it's looking a

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.050 
little bit lighter look it's looking a
little<00:03:32.120> darker<00:03:32.510> here<00:03:33.220> and<00:03:34.220> depending<00:03:34.370> on<00:03:34.760> on

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
little darker here and depending on on

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.460 
little darker here and depending on on
the<00:03:35.299> lighting<00:03:35.630> it<00:03:35.720> can<00:03:35.870> look<00:03:35.989> like<00:03:36.109> that<00:03:36.170> in

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
the lighting it can look like that in

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.890 
the lighting it can look like that in
photos<00:03:36.829> a<00:03:36.859> video<00:03:37.190> but<00:03:38.060> she<00:03:38.329> lightened<00:03:38.690> up<00:03:38.780> to

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
photos a video but she lightened up to

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.150 
photos a video but she lightened up to
your<00:03:38.989> really<00:03:39.260> pretty<00:03:39.470> color<00:03:39.709> so<00:03:39.920> it<00:03:39.980> wasn't

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
your really pretty color so it wasn't

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.180

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
like she lined up to some weird color so

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.890
