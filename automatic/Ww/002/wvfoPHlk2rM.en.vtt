now you may see some steam coming off
that's<00:01:42.530> just<00:01:42.859> product<00:01:43.159> residues<00:01:43.549> that's

that's just product residues that's

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.800 
that's just product residues that's
perfectly<00:01:44.149> gone<00:01:46.090> when<00:01:47.090> curling<00:01:47.329> the<00:01:47.570> hair<00:01:47.600> is

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
perfectly gone when curling the hair is

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.349 
perfectly gone when curling the hair is
close<00:01:48.049> to<00:01:48.200> the<00:01:48.289> roots<00:01:48.469> as<00:01:48.619> possible<00:01:49.359> this

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:50.359 
close to the roots as possible this

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:52.359 
close to the roots as possible this
creates<00:01:50.750> a<00:01:50.899> natural<00:01:51.079> soft<00:01:51.679> volume<00:01:51.979> and

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
creates a natural soft volume and

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.849 
creates a natural soft volume and
texture<00:01:53.179> right<00:01:53.840> from<00:01:54.049> the<00:01:54.170> roots<00:01:54.380> and<00:01:54.619> through

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:54.859 
texture right from the roots and through

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:56.800 
texture right from the roots and through
the<00:01:54.979> fringe<00:01:55.189> area<00:01:55.520> remember<00:01:56.420> to<00:01:56.509> keep<00:01:56.630> each

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
the fringe area remember to keep each

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.139 
the fringe area remember to keep each
section<00:01:57.319> the<00:01:57.950> same<00:01:58.189> size<00:01:58.490> so<00:01:58.759> you<00:01:58.850> keep<00:01:58.969> the

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
section the same size so you keep the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:00.499 
section the same size so you keep the
field<00:01:59.360> consistent

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
field consistent

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.359 
field consistent
if<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.049> have<00:02:01.170> longer<00:02:01.619> or<00:02:01.799> thicker<00:02:02.070> hair<00:02:02.340> you

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
if you have longer or thicker hair you

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.130 
if you have longer or thicker hair you
may<00:02:02.670> need<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:02.909> take<00:02:03.090> smaller<00:02:03.479> sections<00:02:03.719> like

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
may need to take smaller sections like

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.050 
may need to take smaller sections like
we're<00:02:04.350> doing<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.710> with<00:02:04.829> jazz<00:02:05.039> if<00:02:05.789> you<00:02:05.909> have

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
we're doing it with jazz if you have

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.419 
we're doing it with jazz if you have
finer<00:02:06.360> hair<00:02:06.509> or<00:02:06.869> shorter<00:02:07.229> hair<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:08.280> can

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
finer hair or shorter hair you can

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.790 
finer hair or shorter hair you can
actually<00:02:08.670> take<00:02:08.849> larger<00:02:09.179> sections<00:02:09.569> now<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.590> like

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
actually take larger sections now I like

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.830 
actually take larger sections now I like
using<00:02:11.099> curl<00:02:11.280> secret<00:02:11.700> for<00:02:11.879> this<00:02:12.000> look<00:02:12.209> because

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
using curl secret for this look because

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.600 
using curl secret for this look because
it<00:02:13.140> gives<00:02:13.290> an<00:02:13.410> even<00:02:13.830> heat<00:02:14.040> around<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.459> hair

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
it gives an even heat around the hair

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.490 
it gives an even heat around the hair
shaft<00:02:14.879> and<00:02:15.150> you<00:02:15.959> don't<00:02:16.110> get<00:02:16.170> any<00:02:16.319> of<00:02:16.440> those

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500

curling<00:02:18.599> appliances<00:02:19.080> now<00:02:19.620> this<00:02:19.769> remember<00:02:20.099> not

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250
