there's got to be something in it for
MLG<00:03:43.350> TV<00:03:44.350> too<00:03:45.190> and<00:03:45.700> maybe<00:03:45.970> it's<00:03:46.180> because<00:03:46.330> MLG<00:03:46.930> TV

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
MLG TV too and maybe it's because MLG TV

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.160 
MLG TV too and maybe it's because MLG TV
doesn't<00:03:48.430> allow<00:03:48.730> you<00:03:48.790> to<00:03:49.030> use<00:03:49.060> any<00:03:49.450> ad<00:03:49.690> blockers

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
doesn't allow you to use any ad blockers

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.710 
doesn't allow you to use any ad blockers
and<00:03:50.350> I<00:03:50.950> think<00:03:51.190> I<00:03:51.280> saw<00:03:51.430> a<00:03:51.459> statistic<00:03:51.910> on<00:03:52.360> Twitter

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
and I think I saw a statistic on Twitter

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.040 
and I think I saw a statistic on Twitter
that<00:03:52.810> said<00:03:53.170> eighty<00:03:53.830> percent<00:03:54.430> of<00:03:54.940> the<00:03:55.330> ads<00:03:55.540> were

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
that said eighty percent of the ads were

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.830 
that said eighty percent of the ads were
being<00:03:56.709> blocked<00:03:57.070> before<00:03:57.430> they<00:03:57.910> remove<00:03:58.810> the

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
being blocked before they remove the

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.530 
being blocked before they remove the
ability<00:03:59.410> to<00:03:59.530> use<00:03:59.740> at<00:04:00.010> blockers<00:04:00.490> on<00:04:01.150> their

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
ability to use at blockers on their

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.130 
ability to use at blockers on their
streams<00:04:02.380> and<00:04:02.650> so<00:04:02.950> this<00:04:03.670> is<00:04:03.820> a<00:04:03.850> new<00:04:04.450> this<00:04:04.870> is<00:04:05.020> an

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
streams and so this is a new this is an

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.080 
streams and so this is a new this is an
amazing<00:04:05.440> revenue<00:04:06.190> source<00:04:06.490> for<00:04:06.550> them<00:04:06.820> and<00:04:06.970> my

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
amazing revenue source for them and my

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.740 
amazing revenue source for them and my

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
question is is it considered could that

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.199 
question is is it considered could that
