00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.659
 good 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.059
 How is it going 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.890
 all the numbers 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.330
 pride 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.870
 and everything 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:49.469
 the streams of dark green like 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.469
 you can wait 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.510
 I dont know 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.270
 and everything 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:03.430
 we see that it still retains although its 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.490
 detention is equal on a lot of 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:09.270
 movements and impressions for example a 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.270
 lost moment 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.830
 where you can do a little stress 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.830
 how can 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:50.760
 how it moves but can be moved 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.760
 although the sound is good but good 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.970
 we are talked about as outside 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.119
 how can 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.420
 we have everyone 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.109
 this case 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.750
 It is very very good this 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.640
 in Youtube 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:04.680
 he complicated us 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.680
 in a week 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.880
 same terms 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.600
 and let's write down 65 are writes 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:31.840
 they are shuffled very much 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:34.840
 same dark 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.840
 etc 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.430
 and many things 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:50.420
 but with the same 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.340
 It is a graph 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.880
 efe 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.880
 but not 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.560
 you have blood 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.370
 yes 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.370
 front 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.240
 again and again
