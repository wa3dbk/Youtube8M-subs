okay<00:00:03.960> so<00:00:04.020> let's<00:00:04.230> talk<00:00:04.440> fixed-pitch<00:00:05.420> micro

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
okay so let's talk fixed-pitch micro

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.160 
okay so let's talk fixed-pitch micro
helicopters<00:00:07.200> now<00:00:08.040> we<00:00:08.100> have<00:00:08.400> the<00:00:08.580> 99<00:00:09.090> 58<00:00:09.629> at<00:00:10.020> the

helicopters<00:00:19.230> you<00:00:19.590> can<00:00:19.740> see<00:00:19.920> that<00:00:20.039> they've

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:20.190 
helicopters you can see that they've

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.160 
helicopters you can see that they've
both<00:00:20.400> got<00:00:20.670> their<00:00:20.820> swashplate<00:00:21.150> saw<00:00:21.630> ranted<00:00:22.050> the

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
both got their swashplate saw ranted the

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.130 
both got their swashplate saw ranted the
same<00:00:22.410> way<00:00:23.150> and<00:00:24.150> they<00:00:24.240> both<00:00:24.420> have<00:00:24.630> stabilizer

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
same way and they both have stabilizer

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.130 
same way and they both have stabilizer
bars<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:26.070> 99<00:00:26.580> 58<00:00:27.060> has<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.269> stabilizer<00:00:27.840> bar

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
bars the 99 58 has a stabilizer bar

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.160 
bars the 99 58 has a stabilizer bar
underneath<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.740> rotor<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.310> V<00:00:30.090> 911<00:00:30.720> has<00:00:30.930> the

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
underneath the rotor the V 911 has the

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.380 
underneath the rotor the V 911 has the

stabilizer bar located on top of the

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.389 
stabilizer bar located on top of the
rotor<00:00:33.980> compare<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.760> MSR<00:00:36.239> X<00:00:36.450> who<00:00:36.899> has

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
rotor compare that to the MSR X who has

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.990 
rotor compare that to the MSR X who has
the<00:00:38.399> rotor<00:00:38.640> only<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:40.140> employs<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.800> gyroscope<00:00:41.700> on

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
the rotor only it employs a gyroscope on

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.049 
the rotor only it employs a gyroscope on
there<00:00:42.300> on<00:00:42.480> board<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:43.710> help<00:00:44.160> stabilize<00:00:44.790> the

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
there on board to help stabilize the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.810 
there on board to help stabilize the
thing<00:00:45.540> and<00:00:45.809> then<00:00:46.320> it's<00:00:46.469> also<00:00:46.649> got<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.430> swash

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
thing and then it's also got the swash

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.090 
thing and then it's also got the swash
plate<00:00:48.059> kind<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.480> shifted<00:00:48.870> 45-degree<00:00:49.739> angles

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
plate kind of shifted 45-degree angles

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.069 
plate kind of shifted 45-degree angles
so<00:00:50.280> that<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.550> attachment<00:00:51.120> points<00:00:51.510> are<00:00:51.660> at<00:00:51.780> 6

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
so that the attachment points are at 6

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.650 
so that the attachment points are at 6
and<00:00:52.440> 3<00:00:52.860> o'clock<00:00:56.090> so<00:00:57.090> what<00:00:57.180> we<00:00:57.270> like<00:00:57.420> about<00:00:57.449> each

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
and 3 o'clock so what we like about each

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.250 
and 3 o'clock so what we like about each
one<00:00:57.890> the<00:00:58.890> 99<00:00:59.399> 58<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.120> V<00:01:00.239> 911<00:01:00.809> obviously

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
one the 99 58 and the V 911 obviously

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.110 
one the 99 58 and the V 911 obviously
are<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.559> two<00:01:01.770> cheaper<00:01:02.370> models

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
are the two cheaper models

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.370 
are the two cheaper models
I<00:01:03.320> think<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.860> 99<00:01:05.339> 58<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.149> a<00:01:06.630> little<00:01:06.960> bit<00:01:07.049> easier

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
I think the 99 58 is a little bit easier

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.590 
I think the 99 58 is a little bit easier
to<00:01:07.409> fly<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:08.490> comes<00:01:08.700> with<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.939> radio<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.330> has

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
to fly it comes with a radio that has

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.060 
to fly it comes with a radio that has
both<00:01:09.810> high<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.080> low<00:01:10.229> settings<00:01:10.710> out<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:11.010> the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
both high and low settings out of the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.520 
both high and low settings out of the
box<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.700> on<00:01:12.360> low<00:01:12.600> settings<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.229> thing<00:01:13.409> is

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
box and on low settings this thing is

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.320 
box and on low settings this thing is
really<00:01:13.740> stable<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.430> can<00:01:14.580> fly<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:14.970> indoors

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
really stable you can fly it indoors

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.050 
really stable you can fly it indoors
right<00:01:15.510> off<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.020> bat<00:01:16.200> it's<00:01:16.439> not<00:01:16.820> exactly<00:01:17.820> like

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
right off the bat it's not exactly like

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.810 
right off the bat it's not exactly like
a<00:01:18.090> coax<00:01:18.600> but<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.500> know<00:01:19.590> it's<00:01:19.890> very<00:01:19.950> stable<00:01:20.400> I

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
a coax but you know it's very stable I

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.520 
a coax but you know it's very stable I
think<00:01:21.360> having<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.600> rotor<00:01:21.840> closer<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.439> the

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
think having the rotor closer to the

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.499 
think having the rotor closer to the
body<00:01:22.710> on<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:22.950> V<00:01:23.220> 911<00:01:23.820> gives<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.180> little<00:01:24.390> bit

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
body on the V 911 gives it a little bit

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.780 
body on the V 911 gives it a little bit
higher<00:01:24.720> performance<00:01:25.580> you<00:01:26.580> know<00:01:26.670> the

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
higher performance you know the

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.730 
higher performance you know the
trade-off<00:01:27.150> being<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.689> it's<00:01:27.840> not<00:01:28.049> quite<00:01:28.380> as

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
trade-off being that it's not quite as

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.090 
trade-off being that it's not quite as
user-friendly<00:01:29.330> right<00:01:30.330> out<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.659> box

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
user-friendly right out of the box

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.630 
user-friendly right out of the box
incidentally<00:01:32.100> one<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.430> cool<00:01:32.610> things

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
incidentally one of the cool things

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.399 
incidentally one of the cool things
about<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.240> 911<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.049> can<00:01:34.200> buy<00:01:34.350> it

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
about the 911 is that you can buy it

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.050 
about the 911 is that you can buy it
without<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.100> radio<00:01:35.430> also<00:01:37.220> so<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.310> know<00:01:38.520> when

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
without the radio also so you know when

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.670 
without the radio also so you know when
you<00:01:39.119> as<00:01:39.240> you're<00:01:39.390> buying<00:01:39.570> extra<00:01:39.810> stuff<00:01:40.259> or<00:01:40.560> you

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
you as you're buying extra stuff or you

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.399 
you as you're buying extra stuff or you
can<00:01:40.829> even<00:01:41.009> use<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.430> 911<00:01:42.030> with<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:43.170> know<00:01:43.290> the

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
can even use the 911 with you know the

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.039 
can even use the 911 with you know the
99<00:01:43.680> 58<00:01:44.340> Radio<00:01:44.750> ideally<00:01:45.750> though<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:45.930> think

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
99 58 Radio ideally though I think

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.410 
99 58 Radio ideally though I think
you're<00:01:46.320> gonna<00:01:46.439> always<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:47.549> know<00:01:47.670> move<00:01:47.909> up<00:01:48.119> and

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
you're gonna always you know move up and

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.030 
you're gonna always you know move up and
bind<00:01:48.750> them<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.200> get<00:01:49.439> something<00:01:49.740> like<00:01:49.770> this

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
bind them to get something like this

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.340 
bind them to get something like this
turnigy<00:01:50.520> radio<00:01:50.790> so<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:51.810> can<00:01:51.930> bind<00:01:52.140> them

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
turnigy radio so that you can bind them

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.719 
turnigy radio so that you can bind them
both<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:54.409> the<00:01:55.409> MSR<00:01:55.920> X<00:01:56.100> on<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.340> other<00:01:56.369> hand

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
both to that the MSR X on the other hand

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.410 
both to that the MSR X on the other hand
has<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.780> ton<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.490> aftermarket<00:01:59.490> parts<00:02:00.060> which<00:02:00.240> are

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
has a ton of aftermarket parts which are

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.899 
has a ton of aftermarket parts which are
cool<00:02:00.770> you<00:02:01.770> can<00:02:01.920> see<00:02:02.100> I've<00:02:02.189> bought<00:02:02.430> some<00:02:02.640> stuff

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
cool you can see I've bought some stuff

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.289 
cool you can see I've bought some stuff
here<00:02:03.149> new<00:02:03.360> blade<00:02:03.630> grips<00:02:04.880> you<00:02:05.880> know<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.000> new

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
here new blade grips you know a new

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.810 
here new blade grips you know a new
swash<00:02:07.079> plate<00:02:07.290> there<00:02:07.680> instantly<00:02:08.399> all<00:02:08.640> this

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
swash plate there instantly all this

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.360 
swash plate there instantly all this
stuff<00:02:09.119> just<00:02:09.509> only<00:02:09.690> adds<00:02:09.989> weight<00:02:10.349> over<00:02:11.340> the

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
stuff just only adds weight over the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.750 
stuff just only adds weight over the
stock<00:02:11.730> thing<00:02:11.970> so<00:02:12.150> I'm<00:02:12.270> probably

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
stock thing so I'm probably

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.630 
stock thing so I'm probably
pulling<00:02:13.000> some<00:02:13.030> foot<00:02:13.360> down<00:02:13.569> and<00:02:14.200> it<00:02:15.010> binds<00:02:15.310> as

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
pulling some foot down and it binds as

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.930 
pulling some foot down and it binds as
well<00:02:15.879> to<00:02:16.360> you<00:02:17.049> know<00:02:17.140> a<00:02:17.170> spectrum<00:02:17.680> radio<00:02:17.980> so<00:02:18.909> you

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
well to you know a spectrum radio so you

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.300 
well to you know a spectrum radio so you
can<00:02:19.239> use<00:02:19.599> that<00:02:19.840> to<00:02:20.290> you<00:02:20.709> know<00:02:20.830> tweak<00:02:21.099> settings

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
can use that to you know tweak settings

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.059 
can use that to you know tweak settings
get<00:02:21.700> a<00:02:21.730> little<00:02:21.909> bit<00:02:22.000> higher<00:02:22.090> performance<00:02:23.069> this

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
get a little bit higher performance this

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.800 
get a little bit higher performance this
without<00:02:24.489> the<00:02:24.730> stabilizer<00:02:25.209> bar<00:02:25.510> is<00:02:25.629> gonna

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
without the stabilizer bar is gonna

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.149 
without the stabilizer bar is gonna
perform<00:02:26.019> quite<00:02:26.409> a<00:02:26.470> bit<00:02:26.680> better<00:02:26.799> than<00:02:27.040> these

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:27.159 
perform quite a bit better than these

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:29.309 
perform quite a bit better than these
but<00:02:27.489> it<00:02:27.580> is<00:02:27.700> much<00:02:28.000> more<00:02:28.180> difficult<00:02:28.420> to<00:02:28.720> fly<00:02:28.870> for

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
but it is much more difficult to fly for

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.369 
but it is much more difficult to fly for
someone<00:02:29.739> who<00:02:30.430> is<00:02:30.700> not<00:02:31.060> accustomed<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:31.900> flying

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379 
someone who is not accustomed to flying

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:35.789 
someone who is not accustomed to flying
fixed-pitch<00:02:33.660> helicopters<00:02:34.660> so<00:02:34.989> definitely<00:02:35.709> a

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
fixed-pitch helicopters so definitely a

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:37.650 
fixed-pitch helicopters so definitely a
kind<00:02:36.099> of<00:02:36.220> a<00:02:36.280> bigger<00:02:36.430> jump<00:02:36.760> from<00:02:36.940> a<00:02:37.030> coax<00:02:37.420> to

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
kind of a bigger jump from a coax to

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.199 
kind of a bigger jump from a coax to
this<00:02:37.750> one<00:02:38.459> what<00:02:39.459> that<00:02:39.610> being<00:02:39.819> said<00:02:40.030> it's

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
this one what that being said it's

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:41.640 
this one what that being said it's
pretty<00:02:40.390> pretty<00:02:40.840> stable<00:02:41.260> though<00:02:41.379> with<00:02:41.620> that

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
pretty pretty stable though with that

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.009 
pretty pretty stable though with that
gyroscope<00:02:42.579> that<00:02:42.610> it<00:02:42.940> has<00:02:45.660> as<00:02:46.660> far<00:02:46.900> as

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
gyroscope that it has as far as

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.729 
gyroscope that it has as far as
aftermarket<00:02:47.650> support<00:02:48.040> goes<00:02:49.140> on<00:02:50.140> all<00:02:50.440> of<00:02:50.620> them

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
aftermarket support goes on all of them

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.289 
aftermarket support goes on all of them
