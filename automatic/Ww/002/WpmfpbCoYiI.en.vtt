thickness<00:00:53.940> on<00:00:54.240> my<00:00:54.390> model<00:00:57.020> so<00:00:58.020> now<00:00:58.230> I'm<00:00:58.530> going

00:00:58.730 --> 00:00:58.740 
thickness on my model so now I'm going

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.100 
thickness on my model so now I'm going
to<00:00:58.860> place<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.329> horizontally<00:01:00.329> but<00:01:00.660> at<00:01:00.870> the

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
to place it horizontally but at the

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.890 
to place it horizontally but at the
crown<00:01:01.410> area<00:01:01.680> this<00:01:02.130> will<00:01:02.340> give<00:01:02.520> volume<00:01:02.900> so

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
crown area this will give volume so

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:10.319 
crown area this will give volume so
again<00:01:04.140> snap<00:01:04.500> in<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:04.949> then<00:01:05.730> style

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:10.329 

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:12.789 

what's<00:01:11.329> so<00:01:11.479> incredible<00:01:11.990> is<00:01:12.170> you<00:01:12.290> can<00:01:12.439> see<00:01:12.619> how

what's so incredible is you can see how

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.219 
what's so incredible is you can see how
easy<00:01:13.100> it<00:01:13.280> is<00:01:13.399> to<00:01:13.640> achieve<00:01:13.729> and<00:01:14.299> again<00:01:14.630> how<00:01:15.049> much

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
easy it is to achieve and again how much

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:22.060 
easy it is to achieve and again how much
