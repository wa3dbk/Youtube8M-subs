00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:08.099
 Personal op of the direct take, okay, I'm fine. 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.540
 here's how it goes I'm going to the 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.599
 settings next to it 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.240
 in the settings menu and it's logical let's 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.600
 in the very controversial part of windows phone 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.060
 point of sale 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.130
 phone spends a lot of battery I 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.340
 I honestly think it spends more than 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.039
 I spent what I spent on windows 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.810
 was normal then beauty and time 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.160
 recharge aquidauana you unfair do 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.570
 less than an hour after I finished 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.570
 but it's because I loaded only one 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.059
 bit by dropping 10% or 20 % 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.280
 maybe never the pain but anyway you have 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.230
 this screen here in battery saving 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.719
 What information do you have here? 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.160
 Important activated battery saving 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.450
 and disabled and as a guide for 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.610
 let's go there settings 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.550
 the first thing I recommend the battery 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.739
 the economist activated and but only recommend 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.840
 that you leave marked this option is 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.640
 prolong the battery life when the 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.010
 battery is low 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.019
 if you always put whatsapp it will not 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.260
 never work only when you open 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.240
 example until the next load goes 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.850
 make it in a state of 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.520
 emergency battery stays here and deactivates 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.020
 everything in the background practically and in the 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.540
 next time you put it in the 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.939
 turn off the power save function. 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.009
 This marked battery when the battery 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.740
 is weak and then if it unloads 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.509
 in your pocket, he's all right there 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.650
 It lasts some more time, you can do it. 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.479
 a call 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.170
 worth leaving when she is 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.640
 weak, but here beside you you have the 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.369
 this has been implemented in the 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.320
 windows phone 8.1 is sensational 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:45.329
 so you have all the apps 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:47.820
 installed saying everything you have 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.920
 spending different energy and android 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.390
 windows phone you have access to all 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.579
 even those who are not spending 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.810
 and touching him you know how much he 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.939
 worn out battery 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.409
 the open application and how much of battery 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.719
 spent the app in the background 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.640
 so for example you will also spent 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.940
 because because I was in 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.430
 first plan 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.400
 this was the way I was seeing 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.680
 videos on it was watching youtube 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.650
 on youtube it's in the foreground 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.330
 now this team or here this square 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.670
 which is showing the videos I 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.070
 I have it on my timeline to 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.570
 watch the channels that the killer who 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.980
 here running in the background 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.150
 every half hour to update the 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.030
 information 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.020
 then beauty taking on itaipu seeds 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.820
 is stirring here 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.640
 keeping this in mind by looking at this chart 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.840
 here it seems much smarter and 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.210
 taking 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.670
 He did not come back, everything was fine then. 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.290
 Watching the video spent energy and 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.120
 energy he liked the phone 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.490
 to cut the stadiums was this 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.440
 schema there allows the application to 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.710
 to run in the background 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.330
 activated if you disable it from here it goes 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.760
 stop and refresh the desktop 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.420
 where you will stop putting the information 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.300
 on here 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.430
 on the home screen if an application 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.470
 I need the information 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.620
 I will never disable this option 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.300
 ever now the app that does not deserve 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.580
 this option an application that is 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.040
 running around for free for free 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.140
 disable you have no option to allow 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.700
 the application even with economy 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.130
 battery pack 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:23.709
 It is interesting for example you can 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:25.150
 let the ax in jail know what I 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.840
 I passed by him 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:31.780
 the then cardinal attack attack attack the 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:34.269
 whatsapp i leave the zap allowed is 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.160
 allowed to run in the background 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.959
 even with the low battery because I 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.760
 I want to receive messages whenever I do not 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.700
 I want to almost stop working at 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.739
 it's interesting that this is an application 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.110
 that you think you do not deserve to run in 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.250
 for example hunger I do not 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.560
 I think he deserves to run in second place. 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.420
 plan and deactivate his or her 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.980
 run in the background here all 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.360
 applications that have this control 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.360
 if the staff here show all the 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.800
 applications on the applications in use 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.000
 bones that can be carried 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.209
 second plan 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.880
 there the tip the internet explorer it does not 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:09.880
 deserve to run in the background for me 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:12.010
 I soon killed him and that's not allowed. 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.390
 The tip is the little gallery you know. 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.790
 who is running in the background does not 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.100

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.440
 Advanced shows all uses of all 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.720
 the apps is cool anyway and you can 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.490
 see in each one and mark whether it deserves or not 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.680
 when it's background but not 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.600
 simply find out who is 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.550

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.020
