have<00:07:04.050> this<00:07:04.140> little<00:07:04.380> opening<00:07:04.710> right<00:07:04.860> here<00:07:04.920> and

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:05.310 
have this little opening right here and

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:06.500 
have this little opening right here and
I<00:07:05.430> thought<00:07:05.640> something<00:07:06.030> else<00:07:06.090> was<00:07:06.270> supposed<00:07:06.330> to

I thought something else was supposed to

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:07.700 
I thought something else was supposed to
go<00:07:06.660> in<00:07:06.810> there<00:07:06.990> but<00:07:07.200> it's<00:07:07.320> just<00:07:07.350> part<00:07:07.590> of<00:07:07.620> the

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:07.710 
go in there but it's just part of the

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:08.870 
go in there but it's just part of the
packaging<00:07:08.130> which<00:07:08.310> I<00:07:08.400> thought<00:07:08.520> was<00:07:08.610> kind<00:07:08.820> of

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:08.880 
packaging which I thought was kind of

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.050 
packaging which I thought was kind of
weird<00:07:09.380> but<00:07:10.380> fins<00:07:10.920> golden<00:07:11.310> the<00:07:11.370> sort<00:07:11.580> of<00:07:11.700> battle

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:12.060 
weird but fins golden the sort of battle
