00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.480
 what wave friends of youtube here are 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.640
 ideas in this new video of a gameplay 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.619
 from minecraft that edit in a way 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.880
 script that is called villagers this 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.190
 I had previously uploaded to my channel 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.800
 a world that is called villagers but I 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.540
 they had asked that if I could 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.850
 customize this we have putting it in 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.820
 Spanish and telling him if he could put 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:35.690
 the skin of villagers and then I found the 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.730
 way to put them and then we started what 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.140
 that a description is to leave a page 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.570
 They are unloaded from the middle 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.890
 and we are going to enter our manager 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.960
 of files that do not have it 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.879
 draw in the description we're going to go 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.190
 where the file was downloaded 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.329
 that in the case of a blog 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.940
 it will appear 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.670
 it's called models a day we're going to 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.530

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.989
 we're going to give it tight and we're going to 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.680
 be to put extract in what we are going to 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.450

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.280
 I already have them but I 'm going to say yes 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.230

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.030

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.159
