00:00:01.339 --> 00:00:05.670
 At the Rikuo Festival objects as introduced earlier in another example 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.670
 Has the characteristics of the vision to be started from the beginning 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:13.529
 Therefore, without particular awareness of the food verizon 

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:16.740
 I can do the operation, for example, polygon option 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.089
 Make a copy 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:22.660
 I'm going to eco now Kore box theory is copied 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.650
 It is such a state It is this when we scream in this state 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.650
 It looks like 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.900
 Copy some of these details 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.120
 Then 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.380
 From this polygon in a curve 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.380
 I have a movie on the curve 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.900
 In the remaining selected state earlier 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.070
 I will duplicate this along the curve 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.300
 Then it looks like this 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.020
 Improper has been made, for example, end point change 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.940
 Do 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.830
 Work such as Este Brivilla changing level 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.680
 But as it is 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.730
 Sub revision 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.730
 I think you can see that it has been updated 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.400
 Consciousness to calculate especially vision vision in Ebisu 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.090
 Do regular modeling tasks without 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.300
 can do 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.670
 From tax apart 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.470
 You can use these things in various ways, for example 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.800
 After all we take out cube 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.120
 next 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.120
 Meanwhile Thailand will copy 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.880
 Let's add to the display in the House of Representatives 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.330
 Well then these two 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.330
 It is a cube, but in the selected state 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.480
 If there are remaining plums 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.920
 Out 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.920
 Run 224 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.110
 If you look at yourself in Explorer, it looks like this 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.110
 You can see that one mesh is made 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.050
 Then, I'm putting a vision for people who are stuck with this business card 

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:16.159
 jcb it has not been visible but it is actually 

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:22.769
 Turn the two outer balls into a wire frame cover 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.909
 Let's go 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:28.909
 You can see that this kind of long 

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:36.459
 In other words, there are two vision services to be brilliant 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.399
 It is in a state of being 

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:41.599
 edy is moving the outer ball to choice 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.739
 Then it looks like this 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.629
 You can see it moving as if it were fused 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.629
 I think 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:06.109
 Celebrate the turning point with the above
