00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:07.040
 hello how good are you all at this 

00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:11.150
 in this new video I want you I love you 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.079
 explain how to stop the experience in a 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.110
 world of warcraft 

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:18.070
 if this is used mostly for 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.500
 make yourself a touring character 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.920
 and well there are many people who do not know how 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.290
 do it or where is he 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.510
 the guy who does it so nothing in this 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.810
 video in a moment and I'm going to 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.840
 show where I am to see in storm 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.110
 concretely in the castle and just 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.250
 in front I have the king after having 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.840
 gone through the hallway like having the 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.260
 experience because I for example I'm 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.390
 with this character at level 19 and the wall 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.730
 because I wanted to make myself a twin that a 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.890
 twin that is basically a character that 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.239
 stays at a particular level and if the 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.150
 equipment as much as possible to 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.559
 make it far superior to others 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:05.180
 we entered this room that is just 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.170
 behind the kings and here is a lord 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.130
 apply an invisible medium that is called 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.200
 you see this level 19 also 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.719
 and if we click on it it says the following 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.610
 they speak it you have to gain experience nothing 

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:19.220
 not a little bit like that and it gives you two options 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.570
 the first although I have them in English 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.140
 Well, neither do you need actions 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.460
 lumbreras tells you I do not want to go back to 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.549
 gain experience 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.100
 so if you give this one you'll have to 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:34.039
 I do not know if it's ten gold I think and 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.450
 will stop the experience if you look at 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:37.429
 my experience bar I already have it 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.679
 stop and if you want to win again 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:43.009
 you simply give the second option 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:46.520
 and you will gain experience again so 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:49.789
 nothing to explain in a video a guide 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.490
 basic how to make a tweet I 'm 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.259
 I have it half done is not complete 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.599
 but I hope I have served you 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:59.750
 that from now on you already know how 

00:01:56.599 --> 00:02:02.120
 for the experience in world of warcraft 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:06.550
 and nothing and I wait for you in my next video 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.550
 and greetings to all of you until next time
