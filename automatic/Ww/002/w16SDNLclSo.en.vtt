00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
hello welcome back what I have here is a

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.420 
hello welcome back what I have here is a
t9<00:00:14.610> flyer<00:00:14.940> with<00:00:15.509> t9<00:00:16.199> Arrow<00:00:16.560> falls<00:00:16.710> from<00:00:17.340> the

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
t9 flyer with t9 Arrow falls from the

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.300 
t9 flyer with t9 Arrow falls from the
back<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.119> front<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.920> as<00:00:19.920> you<00:00:20.100> can<00:00:20.279> see

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
back to the front and as you can see

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.820 
back to the front and as you can see
it's<00:00:20.820> covered<00:00:21.240> with<00:00:21.270> electroplate<00:00:22.199> so<00:00:22.619> it

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
it's covered with electroplate so it

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.029 
it's covered with electroplate so it
should<00:00:23.189> be<00:00:23.220> hard<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.359> go<00:00:24.390> down<00:00:24.660> i<00:00:25.039> currently

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
should be hard to go down i currently

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.089 
should be hard to go down i currently
have<00:00:26.490> 14<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.420> plasma<00:00:27.840> cannons<00:00:28.260> mounted<00:00:28.619> under

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
have 14 and plasma cannons mounted under

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.130 
have 14 and plasma cannons mounted under
it<00:00:29.250> but<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.789> can<00:00:29.939> place<00:00:30.150> more<00:00:30.510> if<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:30.779> fool

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
it but you can place more if you fool

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.650 
it but you can place more if you fool
around<00:00:31.199> with<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:32.009> always<00:00:32.910> run<00:00:33.210> out<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.420> space

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
around with it I always run out of space

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.729 
around with it I always run out of space
so<00:00:33.870> that's<00:00:34.590> why<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:34.829> only<00:00:35.100> has<00:00:35.340> four<00:00:35.730> cannons

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
so that's why it only has four cannons

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:39.799 
so that's why it only has four cannons
also<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:37.860> fire<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.370> called<00:00:38.700> immortal<00:00:39.570> and

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
also this fire is called immortal and

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.979 
also this fire is called immortal and
I'm<00:00:40.649> going<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:40.890> be<00:00:41.010> doing<00:00:41.719> improvements<00:00:42.719> on<00:00:42.840> it

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
I'm going to be doing improvements on it

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.250 
I'm going to be doing improvements on it
over<00:00:43.230> time<00:00:43.640> it<00:00:44.640> has<00:00:44.969> four<00:00:45.390> thrusters<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:46.200> it

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
over time it has four thrusters so it

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.020 
over time it has four thrusters so it
should<00:00:46.530> make<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:46.920> high<00:00:47.160> enough<00:00:47.219> for<00:00:47.730> flanking

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
should make it high enough for flanking

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.340 
should make it high enough for flanking
and<00:00:49.129> also<00:00:50.129> i<00:00:50.160> uploaded<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.879> gameplay<00:00:51.390> video<00:00:51.570> so
