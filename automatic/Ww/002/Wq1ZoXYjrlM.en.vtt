books 7.0 read-a-thon I believe the link

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.630 
books 7.0 read-a-thon I believe the link
down<00:00:49.110> below<00:00:49.140> I'll<00:00:49.800> also<00:00:50.010> leave<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.280> link<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.550> my

as any to read it plus a second book has
already<00:02:41.780> come<00:02:42.050> out<00:02:42.080> so<00:02:42.470> I<00:02:42.500> can<00:02:42.770> get<00:02:42.890> straight

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
already come out so I can get straight

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.820 
already come out so I can get straight
on<00:02:43.280> to<00:02:43.400> that<00:02:43.520> one<00:02:43.670> and<00:02:44.380> the<00:02:45.380> last<00:02:45.530> book<00:02:45.800> that

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
on to that one and the last book that

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.980 
on to that one and the last book that
I'm<00:02:46.130> planning<00:02:46.280> on<00:02:46.520> reading<00:02:46.880> is<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.390> invention

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
I'm planning on reading is the invention

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.260 
I'm planning on reading is the invention
of<00:02:48.290> Hugo<00:02:48.680> Cabret<00:02:48.710> by<00:02:49.220> Brian<00:02:49.520> Selznick<00:02:50.030> and<00:02:50.210> I

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick and I

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.730 
of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick and I
decided<00:02:50.570> to<00:02:50.840> choose<00:02:51.020> this<00:02:51.260> one<00:02:51.440> because<00:02:51.500> I

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
decided to choose this one because I

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.020 
decided to choose this one because I
thought<00:02:51.980> it<00:02:52.190> would<00:02:52.370> give<00:02:52.520> me<00:02:52.670> a<00:02:52.700> bit<00:02:52.880> of<00:02:52.910> a

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
thought it would give me a bit of a

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.480 
thought it would give me a bit of a
break<00:02:53.240> from<00:02:53.420> all<00:02:53.630> these<00:02:53.780> other<00:02:54.040> big<00:02:55.040> books

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
break from all these other big books

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.450 
break from all these other big books
although<00:02:56.060> it<00:02:56.450> is<00:02:56.570> quite<00:02:57.020> a<00:02:57.230> hefty<00:02:57.650> book<00:02:57.920> itself

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
although it is quite a hefty book itself

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.190 
although it is quite a hefty book itself
it<00:02:58.850> shouldn't<00:02:59.240> take<00:02:59.300> me<00:02:59.570> too<00:02:59.750> long<00:02:59.780> to<00:03:00.110> get

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
it shouldn't take me too long to get

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.170 
it shouldn't take me too long to get
through<00:03:00.500> it<00:03:00.560> because<00:03:00.950> a<00:03:01.400> lot<00:03:01.790> of<00:03:01.820> the<00:03:01.970> pages

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
through it because a lot of the pages

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.630 
through it because a lot of the pages
have<00:03:02.870> illustrations<00:03:03.380> and<00:03:03.890> stuff<00:03:04.340> like<00:03:04.460> that

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
have illustrations and stuff like that

have illustrations and stuff like that
beautiful<00:03:05.300> illustrations<00:03:06.110> so<00:03:06.800> it<00:03:07.100> shouldn't

beautiful illustrations so it shouldn't

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.620

take<00:03:07.370> me<00:03:07.580> too<00:03:07.610> long<00:03:07.790> to<00:03:07.880> get<00:03:08.060> through<00:03:08.270> this<00:03:08.390> and

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
take me too long to get through this and

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.930 
take me too long to get through this and
