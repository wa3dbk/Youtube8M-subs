c5 I did study a bit of the dragon back
in<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.619> day<00:00:22.800> so<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:23.189> know<00:00:23.310> kind<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.060> know<00:00:24.210> what

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
in the day so I know kind of know what

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.730 
in the day so I know kind of know what
I'm<00:00:24.390> doing<00:00:24.510> here<00:00:24.869> it<00:00:25.050> shows<00:00:25.289> an<00:00:25.439> interesting

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
I'm doing here it shows an interesting

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.400 
I'm doing here it shows an interesting
sideline<00:00:26.400> with<00:00:26.670> Knight<00:00:27.269> c3<00:00:27.570> followed<00:00:28.289> by

now<00:00:30.660> night<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.380> d4<00:00:31.920> why<00:00:32.550> could<00:00:32.700> have<00:00:32.820> gone

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
now night to d4 why could have gone

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.270 
now night to d4 why could have gone
Knight<00:00:33.149> f3<00:00:33.719> there<00:00:34.500> I<00:00:34.530> believe<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.070> main

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
Knight f3 there I believe is the main

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.760 
Knight f3 there I believe is the main
move<00:00:35.520> plays<00:00:36.239> Bishop<00:00:36.480> c4<00:00:37.110> which<00:00:37.320> also<00:00:37.500> looks

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
move plays Bishop c4 which also looks

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.850 
move plays Bishop c4 which also looks
reasonable<00:00:38.309> I'll<00:00:39.120> develop<00:00:39.450> my<00:00:39.750> pieces<00:00:40.050> east<00:00:40.530> 6

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
reasonable I'll develop my pieces east 6

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.130 
reasonable I'll develop my pieces east 6
not<00:00:41.070> f6<00:00:41.489> there<00:00:41.910> was<00:00:42.059> some<00:00:42.270> tricks<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:42.930> one<00:00:43.050> of

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
not f6 there was some tricks and one of

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.410 
not f6 there was some tricks and one of
these<00:00:43.320> lines<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:44.129> was<00:00:44.340> here<00:00:44.610> we<00:00:44.789> can't<00:00:45.149> really

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
these lines it was here we can't really

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.440 
these lines it was here we can't really
go<00:00:45.600> d5<00:00:46.399> because<00:00:47.399> he<00:00:47.520> takes<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.090> couple<00:00:48.300> of

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
go d5 because he takes it a couple of

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.080 
go d5 because he takes it a couple of
times<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:48.899> then<00:00:49.110> goes<00:00:49.320> Queen<00:00:49.649> h5<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.910> that

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
times and then goes Queen h5 is that

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.299 
times and then goes Queen h5 is that
true<00:00:51.449> it's<00:00:52.289> not<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.530> most<00:00:52.649> practical<00:00:52.920> thing

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
true it's not the most practical thing

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.060 
true it's not the most practical thing
to<00:00:53.520> calculate<00:00:53.910> here<00:00:54.600> but<00:00:54.930> I'm<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.050> bit<00:00:55.289> curious

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
to calculate here but I'm a bit curious

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.060 
to calculate here but I'm a bit curious
so<00:00:56.520> go<00:00:56.760> d5<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.300> hopefully<00:00:57.960> find<00:00:58.230> out<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.620> think

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
so go d5 and hopefully find out I think

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.439 
so go d5 and hopefully find out I think
this<00:00:59.250> could<00:00:59.460> have<00:00:59.609> been<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.850> thing<00:01:00.180> you're

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
this could have been the thing you're

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.319 
this could have been the thing you're
not<00:01:00.629> supposed<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.140> do<00:01:01.350> let's<00:01:02.280> see<00:01:02.579> he<00:01:02.760> takes<00:01:03.059> de

couldn't<00:01:10.680> really<00:01:10.799> see<00:01:11.159> anything<00:01:11.189> for<00:01:11.760> him<00:01:11.939> but

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
couldn't really see anything for him but

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.460 
couldn't really see anything for him but
I<00:01:12.420> do<00:01:12.540> recall<00:01:12.869> there<00:01:13.290> was<00:01:13.439> this<00:01:13.650> trick<00:01:15.470> maybe

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
I do recall there was this trick maybe

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.649 
I do recall there was this trick maybe
it<00:01:16.680> was<00:01:17.070> another<00:01:17.310> another<00:01:17.729> position<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.360> still

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
it was another another position I still

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.210 
it was another another position I still
can't<00:01:18.900> really<00:01:19.080> see<00:01:19.259> anything<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.770> works<00:01:20.009> for

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
can't really see anything that works for

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.990 
can't really see anything that works for
him<00:01:20.479> let's<00:01:21.479> calculate<00:01:21.840> again<00:01:22.380> 95<00:01:23.130> 95<00:01:23.869> 94<00:01:24.869> CD<00:01:25.470> 4
