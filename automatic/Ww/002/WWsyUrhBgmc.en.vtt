00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.410 
once you do this to somebody else as you

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.560 
once you do this to somebody else as you
can<00:01:24.500> see<00:01:24.650> I'm<00:01:24.770> back<00:01:24.920> in<00:01:25.100> my<00:01:25.369> world<00:01:25.790> I<00:01:26.030> believe

they<00:01:26.750> can<00:01:26.930> actually<00:01:27.110> infiltrate<00:01:27.800> you<00:01:27.920> back<00:01:28.250> so

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
they can actually infiltrate you back so

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.990 
they can actually infiltrate you back so
I<00:01:29.570> don't<00:01:29.810> think<00:01:30.290> he<00:01:30.650> he<00:01:31.130> did<00:01:31.280> personal<00:01:31.700> info<00:01:31.880> to

to<00:01:34.100> somebody<00:01:34.460> else<00:01:34.610> I<00:01:34.729> think<00:01:34.909> they<00:01:35.030> will<00:01:35.150> be

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
to somebody else I think they will be

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.450 
to somebody else I think they will be
prompted<00:01:35.600> to<00:01:35.659> do<00:01:35.840> it<00:01:35.930> to<00:01:36.050> back<00:01:36.290> so<00:01:36.950> if<00:01:37.250> you<00:01:37.340> do

extra<00:01:39.740> paranoid<00:01:40.039> any<00:01:40.369> NPC<00:01:41.000> you<00:01:41.240> see<00:01:41.509> and<00:01:41.780> your

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
extra paranoid any NPC you see and your

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.990 
extra paranoid any NPC you see and your
