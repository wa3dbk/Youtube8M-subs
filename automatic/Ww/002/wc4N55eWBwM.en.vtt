 hi everyone wanted to share my 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.650
 impressed by this flashlight 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:14.309
 ultrafire 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:17.039
 to and again very light flashlight very 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.670
 compact in length somewhere he is 9 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.730
 centimeters 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.390
 a thickness of 2 and a half weighs very easily 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.390
 should batteries 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:34.759
 unscrewed from the back there is a ring 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.759
 battery-like seal 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:48.699
 so where we are 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:50.530
 lens there is a prince seal here and there 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:53.839
 still threaded 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:57.110
 that is, two gaskets standing together where 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:01:03.610
 lens flashlight very high quality 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:06.110
 I found no marriages at all 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.720
 very much for 300 rubles 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.210
 with this flashlight you yourself understand 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.399
 that in the summer, a store for these can be 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:19.190
 only 1000 for one and a half or two thousand miracle 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:22.700
 the best case of course 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:26.979
 worth the wait unfortunately the clip is very 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.960
 tight very strong and well climb the edges 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:33.590
 on a pocket and belts 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.520
 when you pull up to vomit or just fights 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.399
 and fabric and leather 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.380
 my flashlight is not a big hand 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:47.990
 fits perfectly you can fold to 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:53.869
 so you can use such 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:57.530

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:13.650
