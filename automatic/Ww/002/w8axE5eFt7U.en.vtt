00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.370
 beautiful boys as always paws talk 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.139
 today I came back with a comment from su 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.310
 call of duty black ops 2 today vi 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.189
 I carry a gameplay recorded with mp 7 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.449
 equipped with adjustable stock and 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.460
 the grip the one that makes you take out 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.170
 faster the weapon forgive me but to the 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.750
 moment I don't get my name 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.980
 neurons are short-circuited is 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.420
 a 31 2 precisely the rewards that he was 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.980
 using you can see them below a 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.030
 right are the stealth helicopter the 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.649
 blackburn and lobster what I will go to 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.230
 say today in this comment was 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.170
 first of all I wanted to give you a little one 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.520
 honestly advice 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.129
 revolutionized the gaming experience in 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.930
 call of duty black ops 2 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.610
 what exactly are the accessories that I am 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.530
 using on this weapon then the 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.329
 adjustable kick and the damn one 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.140
 handle of which I do not remember the 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.300
 first name 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.110
 I recently put them in all classes 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.970
 because then it is a stupid thing to 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.560
 very stupid reality so stupid 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.420
 that I never thought of before then 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.310
 I practically always complained with 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.320
 the old connection fits fly but 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.540
 first I was shooting and the other one wasn't dying 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.860
 ok that was undoubtedly due to 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.810
 my connection poorer because now 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.509
 that I switched to fastweb even if I get up 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.360
 the weapon after i shoot him i kill him and ok 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.840
 but already before changing connection 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.770
 putting these two simple accessories 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.079
 the gaming experience had changed me 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.329
 totally because it is very simple as 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.509
 what these two accessories allow you 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.490
 to extract and point the weapon at 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.700
 enemy much faster than normal 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.860
 and so it's the game guys 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.720
 because if you can put the 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.939
 enemy on your sight before he 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.740
 do the same is you won like 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.450
 the song said shoot him piero 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.610
 Shoot him hours after a shot 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.200
 still no one did it but it was not 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.030
 just the verse I wanted to mention was 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.049
 like okay something when he had it 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.119
 in the viewfinder but in short, you have understood 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.939
 what I mean by these two 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.950
 simple accessories is then you have a 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.960
 huge advantage over other players 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.479
 that they don't have it obvious if you meet them 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.250
 an opponent who has the same two 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.500
 and okay you understand that they cancel a 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.250
 each other a bit like the most with and more 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.409
 less with less yes yes yes I was losing myself 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.349
 a little in these little arguments but 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:24.470
 yes i said right and more plus it becomes 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.819
 more and less with less becomes more 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.610
 I 'm a genius in math 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.530
 that is, just enough I can go and do it 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.610
 i know quantum physics at university of 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.530
 christie's tk ast then here are these 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.659
 christie and i'm going crazy yes yes yes yes 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.230
 summer is having a bad effect on 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.420
 of me 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.940
 oh well I wanted to tell you just this 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.980
 commentaries on these little things because 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.980
 are tricks that look like bullshit 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.620
 but there is before it passes both pomp and splendor 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.859
 as I have already told you before conquest two 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.879
 simple crap I managed to 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:57.959
 raise the improved absurdly 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:00.120
 which then is not that I ever cheated 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.799
 nothing about the rate is just a small one 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.170
 bullshit invented by developers 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:07.470
 of god to show among friends 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.239
 look at two of them I 'm stronger than you 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.769
 when then maybe the one with two ratios 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.620
 and what you camper for the whole game 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.389
 in a steady corner with bouncing betti 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.060
 stock drones that fly around the 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:19.620
 ass does not know where then from here 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.690
 we say that very often the satin does not 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.940
 reflects the true skill of the player 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.799
 there is a common 10 satin contract 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.239
 which was much stronger than people with 5 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.359
 that just passed the whole game 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.560
 hidden in the chemical rush of where 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:33.569
 among other things you can't even enter 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.940
 just camper to wait for the 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.109
 enemy passed okay said this was 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.060
 just a little tip maybe 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:41.370
 try it and let me know in the comments 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.069
 if this thing works or many of 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.690
 you will tell me very simply good 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.269
 then discovered the hot water of this 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.980
 what I used for two years I didn't and how 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:53.099
 me maybe there is some other idiot who 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.810
 he never understood it so here if if you 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.700
 I was helpful maybe leave me a 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.950
 nice i like that i'm always a lot 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.510
 welcome but apart from that I also wanted to 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.799
 give you another little news and how much 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.970
 this gameplay lasts very little then 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.109
 I have to speed up my speech in 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.169
 how else I wouldn't be able to stay 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:09.389
 in the time established then in August 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:10.709
 I will be much less active than normal 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:12.730
 because then you are young 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.830
 during this summer 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.229
 because I also have a social life 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.729
 and being a schoolboy that schoolboy god 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.400
 sounds so old as a hobby 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:23.680
 being a student who goes in winter 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.180
 at school and in summer he obviously wants 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.290
 also repositioned but going out with 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.180
 friends go to the beach in the mountains in 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.949
 vacation wherever the fuck is and then 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.330
 here already in these past few months you have 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:33.130
 since I was not active as 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.930
 during the winter period and here there 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.830
 is but here in August something comes 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.500
 more important 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.729
 what nothing changes nothing sandro 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.810
 always at sea ​​all the rest between 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:42.160
 the other many of you are there for me 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.020
 also meeting on the bus for 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.789
 just go senigallia where I go 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.470
 however, here is a small thing changing 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:49.360
 what in the last two weeks of 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.830
 August I will not be there but just not there 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.039
 I will therefore very probably be 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:57.249
 much less active because then since 20 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:59.679
 August to 30 I will be 

00:04:57.249 --> 00:05:02.949
 there were yes I will not be home I will not be 

00:04:59.679 --> 00:05:05.199
 in the brands because then from 20 to 25 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:06.999
 more or less if I'm not mistaken I'll be at 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:10.299
 colony gamescon 

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:12.939
 I will go to the colony gamescom for 

00:05:10.299 --> 00:05:14.559
 try all the new games and stories 

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:15.999
 a set and they'll show us are 

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:17.469
 very happy with this thing I do not see 

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:19.449
 the hour I hate I can't wait for it to arrive 

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:21.009
 not even so much because when will the 20th 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:22.659
 August will already be over then summer 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:23.979
 here are two feelings a little 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:25.629
 however, I have to hurry 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:27.369
 because time is not enough if android 

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:29.259
 cologne gamescom and then instead when 

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:30.249
 I'll come back from there. People write to me about it 

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:32.499
 cellphone i'm going crazy 

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:34.239
 when I come back from lisa or for some 

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:35.799
 day in milan also in the company of 

00:05:34.239 --> 00:05:37.239
 all the other youtubers that will be 

00:05:35.799 --> 00:05:38.709
 also columns with me to make one 

00:05:37.239 --> 00:05:39.069
 little thing we will talk about in 

00:05:38.709 --> 00:05:40.899
 future 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:42.729
 Having said that, I just wanted to tell you 

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:44.169
 that maybe other series like you have to macry 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:46.089
 between a move they will suffer small 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:47.469
 delays and instead you can have more 

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:48.759
 co thesis gameplay because in the end there 

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:50.139
 it takes a little less time to register who 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:52.299
 comes that I will do in the following days 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:53.619
 so even this video I trust as 

00:05:52.299 --> 00:05:54.759
 always enjoyed it in the case of below 

00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:55.959
 the numerical document would be 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:57.189
 not at all subscribe to the notary there 

00:05:55.959 --> 00:05:59.139
 let's see with a forthcoming video prague yes 

00:05:57.189 --> 00:06:01.799
 play paws pasta are more breathless 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:01.799
 Christ
