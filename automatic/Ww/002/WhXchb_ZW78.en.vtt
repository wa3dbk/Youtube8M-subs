00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 9 Today's video should be an evaluation 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.390
 swap the crib challenge and that 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.919
 the first for those who do not yet 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.269
 know the crib allens existed completely 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.150
 just that she is a champion 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.670
 takes the non nasus not show and 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.410
 do not continue and try one 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.730
 the largest possible critical hits 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.680
 generate the can you make it alone 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.460
 but also in the team that is absolutely no 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.160
 problem 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.980
 just today's video is almost the 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.779
 Places 2 and 3 show we will be 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.830
 see how they went 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.830
 So let's go in 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:05.670
 that was not that way 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.170
 bad you can see how was the 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.930
 second place is a very good strategy 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.850
 had me caitlin names because this 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.880
 has an excellent passive for this 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.850
 challenge because it makes 250 percent 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.670
 more harm to a mini and that is 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.229
 really really much has to be right 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.720
 Of course, they say that on the 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.850
 first place is pretty close and 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.420
 that alone, the first place 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.860
 in this challenge currently is with two 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.880
 Champions proceed that is only 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.130
 let support 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.479
 the exact course I did not say to 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.100
 You can also join in this challenge 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.720
 easily participate you send me 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.490
 quite simply a replay her 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.220
 has done and the below 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.810
 address and the change itself is like 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.940
 said fluently that is the acting 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.420
 champion is always going to be seen 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.340
 in this video but in the original video 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.619
 and the point is that I too 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.600
 Try a null wikipedia 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.179
 to achieve entry with the 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.039
 the highest critt that is possible 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:05.189
 of course without asus and celebrate 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:07.140
 or without women, that would be a lot 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.720
 too pointless if you just just the 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.459
 would drive all day 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.570
 Well, you can do that too 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.430
 Maybe we can do it 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.829
 and the highest critical time seen 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.570
 I wanted to say that was from 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:22.109
 one caitlin and another 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:26.459
 youtube video with a kick of 4800 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:28.140
 and that means that alone 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.420
 you can still say four friends 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.109
 search and try it as much as possible 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:37.940
 Critically that was all clear to me 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:37.940
 would be relaxed until nothing
