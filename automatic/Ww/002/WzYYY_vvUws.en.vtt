00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.310
 hello in this video I'll show you one 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.830
 can make up a nice eyes from the makeup 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.300
 and for this you need the best one 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.460
 requiem 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.410
 I recommend you a waterproof one too 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.519
 usually take the waterproof 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.690
 make-up always very bad 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.070
 abzubekommen 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.350
 but especially with liquid eyeliner you can 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.970
 also waterproof make-up of it very good 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.789
 and it just keeps a lot 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.449
 better and longer and in addition 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.090
 you still need a kajalstift 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:36.239
 make sure that dates are very soft 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.670
 I recommend you to go here before a go 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.050
 my pencil , for example, is from food 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.340
 they are very easy to apply 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.670
 but also keep long have I been 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:51.719
 times prepared by simply the 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.829
 have applied uniformly eyeliner 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.320
 a line 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.730
 and now is looking for a nice look 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.460
 important that you have the eyeliner right where 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:07.650
 The eyelashes start to the point 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:10.080
 here order means that you just pull 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:18.659
 the line of the remaining euro eyelashes 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:22.650
 and that gives me a nice one 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.960
 contour and now you can behind the 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.290
 line still expand by one here 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.840
 small a small point high behind 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.570
 time to similar to cat ice but not so 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.430
 oarlock 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:41.310
 just help here 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:48.810
 and now I'm rich from above 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:50.670
 curved line as far as and about 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:56.390
 From here, it draws a straight line 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.390
 down times throughout the then Carefully 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.540
 So pay attention to that Zilina already 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:13.690
 evenly, depending on you can do that 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:15.490
 a round here or pointed times so on 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.230
 I would not pull out synonymous 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.240
 then we'll go upstairs 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.620
 finished and now a beautiful one 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.510
 to get away from it 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.970
 it is important that one down here too 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.160
 controller paints and you need it 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:31.020
 now also in kajalstift here contracted 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.760
 now a thin line in yours 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.730
 Angle of the eye on here you pull 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.620
 your song just a bit down 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.540
 pay attention that your kaya injected 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.790
 but it does not make any difference that you are 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.380
 not hurt like i said here now 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.670
 Now just down with your finger 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:50.500
 and now just go with the donor 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.810
 it's best you do that so small 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:03:00.160
 do not move with it either 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:03:02.110
 hurt and slipping can be so long 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:07.570
 go over it like a regular 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:10.630
 have nice black line and now 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.709
 you should as above up here 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.420
 go in the corner 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.220
 you do not need your song for that 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.340
 you can just pull that off 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.980
 but make that beautiful forest open and 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.050
 then carefully draw the line if 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.530
 it has gotten a bit far so deep 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.930
 we can just with his finger the 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.790
 push up a bit then you have 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.470
 a beautiful account around your eyes 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.470
 and a nice shape
