but I think the most important detail in

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.050 
but I think the most important detail in
this<00:03:51.720> project<00:03:51.989> is<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.890> fuel<00:03:53.190> tank<00:03:55.730> it<00:03:56.730> looks

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
almost like original but it isn't if we

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.190 
almost like original but it isn't if we
look<00:04:02.220> carefully<00:04:02.659> Mohammad<00:04:03.659> did<00:04:03.690> a<00:04:03.870> great<00:04:04.170> job
