 entirely of handcrafted wood is a 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:59.230
 parodi helmet and boat interiors 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.120
 it was finished in the yard other 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.140
 oiliness is the carpentry of the interior 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.140

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.789
 let's start talking about the amenities 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:18.310
 It is having outside eg 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:21.130
 good as all motorboats the building 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.960
 fishery this kilo of boats and have 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.270
 very wide corridors where you 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.420
 you can move easily from bow to stern 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.710
 in that it is very safe the ship does not 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.440
 Rola is very stable 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.670
 and good has also has very good 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.229
 adherence to walking because he was 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.600
 wooden cover so washout 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.790
 let's talk about people who are already like 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.950
 family inheritance is not like that 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.100
 because it's a ship that was made in the 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.070
 shipyards of my grandfather roberto ortelli 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.670
 and when it closed the parodi shipyard 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.690
 they in my grandfather reopened it with 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.090
 lorenzo parodi and they started doing 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.619
 ships and this was one of them and the 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.930
 story was that I was with looking 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.640
 a ship and it came to a nautical one and it came 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.350
 a man who was cleaning it and 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.690
 well I knew the boat and I asked 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.190
 chatting chatting I bought it this 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.580
 it was like that so he recovered to the 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.580
 family 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.099
 and 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.959
 and passing the interiors that after 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.379
 tell if good the interiors you have a 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:29.590
 cabin in bow then we go to stern 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:31.930
 the dine facing the line is the 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.599
 very complete kitchen and we went up for a 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.180
 ladder to the rudder was at the helm 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:38.560
 was we have a whole sofa from the side 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.450
 faced to the rudder and the slope 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.280
 there's a little stove there and then we have a 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.049
 open copy back where also 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.030
 has another conservative ice slope and 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.040
 many places of guard and talking about 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.750
 the engines that the ship has 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.269

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.280

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.709
 closed circuit that is a boat 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.980
