00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.319 
top and that's our bait now what I'm
going<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.070> do<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:47.280> put<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.460> few<00:01:47.670> bits<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.030> pieces

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
going to do is put a few bits and pieces

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.210 
going to do is put a few bits and pieces
in<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.750> pocket<00:01:48.960> as<00:01:49.500> I'm<00:01:49.680> going<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.920> be<00:01:49.979> wading

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
in a pocket as I'm going to be wading

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.899 
in a pocket as I'm going to be wading
out<00:01:50.570> and<00:01:51.570> if<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.780> lose<00:01:51.930> her<00:01:52.229> bait<00:01:52.759> and<00:01:53.759> won't

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
out and if I lose her bait and won't

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.300 
out and if I lose her bait and won't
have<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.180> come<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:55.079> that's<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.530> we<00:01:56.130> shall

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
have to come in and that's it we shall

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.179 
have to come in and that's it we shall
make<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.520> start

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.090 

right<00:02:00.189> we<00:02:01.090> have<00:02:01.240> to<00:02:01.360> be<00:02:01.479> stealthy<00:02:02.140> get<00:02:02.799> us<00:02:02.920> near

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
right we have to be stealthy get us near

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.279 
right we have to be stealthy get us near
to<00:02:03.250> the<00:02:03.340> barbel<00:02:03.729> as<00:02:03.820> possible<00:02:04.509> and<00:02:05.110> really

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:05.289 
to the barbel as possible and really

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:06.450 
to the barbel as possible and really
what<00:02:05.469> we're<00:02:05.619> doing<00:02:05.799> is<00:02:05.920> prospecting

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
what we're doing is prospecting

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.630 
what we're doing is prospecting
searching<00:02:07.329> out<00:02:07.450> the<00:02:07.600> water<00:02:07.840> and<00:02:08.319> try<00:02:09.310> to<00:02:09.369> find

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
searching out the water and try to find

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.540 
searching out the water and try to find
out<00:02:09.759> exactly<00:02:10.149> where<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.509> barbel<00:02:10.929> are<00:02:11.550> so

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
out exactly where the barbel are so

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.300 
out exactly where the barbel are so
we'll<00:02:12.910> make<00:02:13.390> a<00:02:13.450> cast<00:02:13.810> flick<00:02:14.379> it<00:02:14.410> nice<00:02:15.099> and

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
we'll make a cast flick it nice and

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.530 
we'll make a cast flick it nice and
gently<00:02:15.519> over<00:02:15.910> there<00:02:16.830> balaam<00:02:17.830> over<00:02:18.390> now<00:02:19.390> this

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
gently over there balaam over now this

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.380 
gently over there balaam over now this
method<00:02:20.050> is<00:02:20.349> very<00:02:20.410> very<00:02:21.069> similar<00:02:21.370> to<00:02:22.209> how<00:02:22.360> i

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390
