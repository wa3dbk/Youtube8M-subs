this is not going to be to cut the my
people<00:01:58.619> very<00:01:59.340> unlikely<00:01:59.490> but<00:02:00.530> obviously<00:02:01.530> we're

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
people very unlikely but obviously we're

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.609 
people very unlikely but obviously we're

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
different countries because that'll just

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.380 
different countries because that'll just
be<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.090> bit<00:02:06.299> too<00:02:06.600> much

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
be a bit too much

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.200 
be a bit too much
but<00:02:07.990> it<00:02:08.080> would<00:02:08.140> be<00:02:08.229> pretty<00:02:08.380> cool<00:02:08.500> steel<00:02:09.210> either

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
but it would be pretty cool steel either

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.130 
but it would be pretty cool steel either
way<00:02:10.360> but<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:11.200> bats<00:02:12.069> there<00:02:12.370> um<00:02:12.670> I<00:02:13.270> think<00:02:13.510> that

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
way but the bats there um I think that

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.510 
way but the bats there um I think that
is<00:02:14.260> going<00:02:14.380> to<00:02:14.470> look<00:02:14.620> pretty<00:02:14.650> damn<00:02:15.040> cool<00:02:15.280> guys

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
is going to look pretty damn cool guys

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.260 
is going to look pretty damn cool guys
pretty<00:02:16.510> damn<00:02:16.720> cool<00:02:16.959> and<00:02:17.580> if<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:18.880> maps<00:02:19.090> are

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
pretty damn cool and if the maps are

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.900 
pretty damn cool and if the maps are
that<00:02:19.720> big<00:02:19.959> if<00:02:20.230> they<00:02:20.650> are<00:02:20.830> combined<00:02:21.400> like<00:02:21.640> that

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
that big if they are combined like that

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.510 
that big if they are combined like that
just<00:02:22.240> it<00:02:23.050> won't<00:02:23.260> exactly<00:02:23.620> look<00:02:23.950> like<00:02:23.980> that<00:02:24.310> put

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
just it won't exactly look like that put

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.360 
just it won't exactly look like that put
together<00:02:24.810> but<00:02:25.810> they<00:02:26.200> cut<00:02:26.530> I<00:02:26.920> reckon<00:02:27.250> they'd

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
together but they cut I reckon they'd

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.860 
together but they cut I reckon they'd
cut<00:02:27.610> pieces<00:02:27.820> of<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.150> map<00:02:28.270> apart<00:02:28.600> and<00:02:28.810> like

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
cut pieces of the map apart and like

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.040 
cut pieces of the map apart and like
piece<00:02:29.260> it<00:02:29.410> together<00:02:29.530> but<00:02:30.150> as<00:02:31.150> you<00:02:31.840> guys<00:02:32.020> know

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050
