pencil some tape and scissors and lastly
but<00:01:02.850> not<00:01:02.910> least<00:01:03.799> markers<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:05.159> be<00:01:05.280> creative

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
but not least markers to be creative

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.429 
but not least markers to be creative
okay<00:01:07.159> so<00:01:08.159> I've<00:01:08.610> got<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:09.240> square<00:01:09.600> one<00:01:10.020> if<00:01:10.320> you

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
okay so I've got a square one if you

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.500 
okay so I've got a square one if you
have<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.590> rectangle<00:01:11.310> cord<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.850> folded<00:01:12.360> in<00:01:12.479> the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
have a rectangle cord it folded in the

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.330 
have a rectangle cord it folded in the
Triangle<00:01:13.490> domains<00:01:15.619> so<00:01:16.619> we've<00:01:16.979> already<00:01:17.189> done

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
Triangle domains so we've already done

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.300 
Triangle domains so we've already done
that<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.180> we've<00:01:19.020> also<00:01:19.229> already<00:01:19.500> folded<00:01:19.979> it

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
that and we've also already folded it

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.530 
that and we've also already folded it
into<00:01:20.670> fourths<00:01:22.340> so<00:01:23.340> as<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.759> can<00:01:23.820> see<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.240> has

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
into fourths so as you can see it has

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.350 
into fourths so as you can see it has
these<00:01:24.780> away<00:01:25.080> lines<00:01:25.590> over<00:01:26.009> there<00:01:26.189> it's<00:01:26.880> because

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
these away lines over there it's because

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.539 
these away lines over there it's because
it's<00:01:27.600> an<00:01:27.780> X<00:01:28.080> because<00:01:28.380> we<00:01:28.710> folded<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.250> go<00:01:29.430> ahead

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
it's an X because we folded it go ahead

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.870 
it's an X because we folded it go ahead
and<00:01:29.909> fold<00:01:30.180> yours<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:31.049> half<00:01:31.890> first<00:01:32.310> like<00:01:32.579> this

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
and fold yours and half first like this

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.069 
and fold yours and half first like this
I'm<00:01:33.479> sorry

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
I'm sorry

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.770

first like this so it goes like this and
kind<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.920> thinking<00:01:38.369> some<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.880> slide<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.360> over

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
kind of thinking some and slide it over

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.020 
kind of thinking some and slide it over
here<00:01:39.659> now<00:01:40.470> as<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.920> see<00:01:41.070> where<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.549> middle<00:01:41.909> is

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
here now as you see where the middle is

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.810 
here now as you see where the middle is
now<00:01:42.540> take<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.110> fold<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.649> again<00:01:43.740> so<00:01:44.700> it's

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
now take that and fold it again so it's

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.630 
now take that and fold it again so it's
a<00:01:44.909> little<00:01:45.270> triangular<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:46.049> little<00:01:46.619> bit<00:01:46.740> now

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
a little triangular a little bit now

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.109 
a little triangular a little bit now
unfold<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:48.780> can<00:01:49.140> work<00:01:49.259> inside<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:50.130> take<00:01:50.909> up

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
unfold it I can work inside and take up

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.670 
unfold it I can work inside and take up
some<00:01:51.810> middle<00:01:52.320> wizzy

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680
