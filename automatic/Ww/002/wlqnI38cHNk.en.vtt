00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.710
 Hello Kaneko 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.740
 today 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:16.950
 Speech method using diaphragm 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.939
 Well that is said Te's a set, such a voice that is in contact with a little diaphragm it is or Tet using the stomach 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.289
 I think that there is a 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:24.310
 We will introduce a preliminary practice for it 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:29.380
 I want to do it 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:32.450
 Speaking of simplicity, it is another movie from the expectation of the diaphragm 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:39.940
 For like a Tairashu how 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:39.940
 At that time also I'd have been pleased to introduce Guggu' place against the arson-ku, the original Mio 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.690
 It it was a soldier instead push in to this 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.650
 Today's snack 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:53.950
 With a voice 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:55.900
 In fact, it is totally meaningless to use the same thing as the diaphragm and to use it when singing 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:00.370
 It is even if only muscle training 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.950
 After all, it doesn't work well, so it's a round trip with this 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.040
 Movement and 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.980
 this 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.980
 It will spare spiritual vision for going in conjunction 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:14.320
 It's flying spear This was destined finger 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.610
 Japanese music scene and 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.610
 Management of sk Oowa 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.600
 Ha ha ha 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.600
 Well, I'll do it like this 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.520
 Ha ha ha 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:38.330
 It's like this, and it's a u-turn 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:42.170
 It is a Met course which is a treatment together with the diaphragm . 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.810
 There are quite a few people who get lost 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:49.810
 What 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:55.000
 Toka may not work well without the bottom of tuff someone 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.720
 What do quite the timing at which the timing and voice has come out better, such as put away something tax rate to throw away 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.370
 You have 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:07.870
 Such people do not work well with the application mark き 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:12.880
 I do, but actually there is no star hail or my voice is hard 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:14.140
 You don't have a place like this. It's very common that such a phenomenon is appearing. 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.550
 There are many 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:21.090
 So I 'm sober, though 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:24.900
 Please try it because it is very important 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:28.470
 There is no need to have much volume 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.750
 There that are linked 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.500
 Not you say 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.490
 That you are Endo this sounds good, even about the 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.490
 Let's do it right 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:45.170
 That fluctuates 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.140
 Please remember this by all means so important 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.710
 Yes 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.740
 Thank you very much for spreading today
