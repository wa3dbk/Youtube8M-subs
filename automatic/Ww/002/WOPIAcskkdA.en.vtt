today<00:00:40.710> i<00:00:40.739> got<00:00:41.250> my<00:00:42.050> second<00:00:43.050> game<00:00:43.890> i<00:00:44.160> ever<00:00:44.190> played

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
today i got my second game i ever played

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.270 
today i got my second game i ever played
on<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:44.879> account<00:00:45.410> it<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.980> Kill<00:00:47.250> Confirmed

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
on this account it is a Kill Confirmed

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.630 
on this account it is a Kill Confirmed
and<00:00:48.059> I'm<00:00:48.840> using<00:00:49.110> one<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.860> default<00:00:50.160> classes

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
and I'm using one of the default classes

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.180 
and I'm using one of the default classes
I<00:00:50.879> forgot<00:00:51.870> which<00:00:52.050> one<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.379> but<00:00:52.829> it's<00:00:53.039> the

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
I forgot which one it is but it's the

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.110 
I forgot which one it is but it's the
one<00:00:53.340> with<00:00:53.579> attack<00:00:53.940> knife<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:55.020> sounds<00:00:56.120> so

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
one with attack knife and that sounds so

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.170 
one with attack knife and that sounds so
overall<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.320> think<00:00:58.379> modern<00:00:58.829> warfare<00:00:59.039> 3<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.910> a

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
overall I think modern warfare 3 is a

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.009 
overall I think modern warfare 3 is a
pretty<00:01:00.600> good<00:01:00.809> game<00:01:02.059> the<00:01:03.059> snipers<00:01:03.570> are<00:01:03.960> a

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
pretty good game the snipers are a

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.740 
pretty good game the snipers are a
little<00:01:04.530> bit<00:01:04.769> overpowered<00:01:05.430> though<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:06.060> don't

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
little bit overpowered though I don't

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.210 
little bit overpowered though I don't
think<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.140> don't<00:01:07.380> know<00:01:07.470> if<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.770> scares<00:01:07.979> me

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
think it I don't know if that scares me

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.090 
think it I don't know if that scares me
but<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:08.880> think<00:01:09.810> they're<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.170> little<00:01:10.770> bit<00:01:10.950> too

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
but I think they're a little bit too

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.140 
but I think they're a little bit too
good<00:01:11.400> because<00:01:11.640> i<00:01:13.130> like<00:01:14.130> when<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.760> snipe

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
good because i like when you snipe

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.830 
good because i like when you snipe
mainly<00:01:16.020> people<00:01:16.409> use<00:01:16.740> quick<00:01:17.070> draw<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.840> quick

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
mainly people use quick draw and quick

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.330 
mainly people use quick draw and quick
draw<00:01:19.020> which<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.290> ridiculous<00:01:19.439> when<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.100> snipe

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
draw which is ridiculous when you snipe

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.789 
draw which is ridiculous when you snipe
it's<00:01:20.790> faster<00:01:21.630> than<00:01:21.869> side<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.200> hand<00:01:22.350> pro<00:01:22.439> from

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
it's faster than side of hand pro from

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.850 
it's faster than side of hand pro from
one<00:01:22.979> or<00:01:23.100> more<00:01:23.130> for<00:01:23.400> two<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:24.049> it's<00:01:25.049> kind<00:01:25.409> of

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
one or more for two and it's kind of

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.140 
one or more for two and it's kind of
annoying<00:01:26.070> ish<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.270> yeah<00:01:28.080> now<00:01:28.829> knife<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:29.880> this

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
annoying ish and yeah now knife in this

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.460 
annoying ish and yeah now knife in this
game<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:31.369> I'd<00:01:32.369> say<00:01:32.640> it's<00:01:32.790> pretty<00:01:32.939> good<00:01:33.470> it

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
game is I'd say it's pretty good it

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.499 
game is I'd say it's pretty good it
wasn't<00:01:34.890> as<00:01:35.009> good<00:01:35.340> as<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.880> was<00:01:36.060> in<00:01:36.240> modern

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
wasn't as good as it was in modern

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.899 
wasn't as good as it was in modern
warfare<00:01:36.540> 2<00:01:37.049> but<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.250> still<00:01:38.549> like<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:40.909> though

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
warfare 2 but I still like it though

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.160 
warfare 2 but I still like it though
knife<00:01:42.180> in<00:01:42.630> this<00:01:42.869> game<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.729> I'd<00:01:44.729> say<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.990> best

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
knife in this game is I'd say the best

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.380 
knife in this game is I'd say the best
thing<00:01:46.409> ever<00:01:46.590> because<00:01:47.220> it's<00:01:47.939> pretty<00:01:48.210> much

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
thing ever because it's pretty much

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.160 
thing ever because it's pretty much
exactly<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:49.049> same<00:01:49.670> as<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:51.240> was<00:01:51.450> in<00:01:51.750> modern

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
exactly the same as it was in modern

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.020 
exactly the same as it was in modern
warfare<00:01:52.229> 2<00:01:52.649> they<00:01:52.950> pretty<00:01:53.130> much<00:01:53.250> like<00:01:53.579> copy<00:01:53.820> and

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
warfare 2 they pretty much like copy and

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.929 
warfare 2 they pretty much like copy and
pasted<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:55.200> I'm<00:01:55.710> pretty<00:01:55.950> glad<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.549> it's

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
pasted it and I'm pretty glad that it's

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.910 
pasted it and I'm pretty glad that it's
not<00:01:57.240> like<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.570> Tom<00:01:57.780> walk<00:01:57.990> from<00:01:58.409> black<00:01:58.649> ops

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
not like the Tom walk from black ops

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.030 
not like the Tom walk from black ops
because<00:01:59.670> the<00:02:00.360> tomahawk<00:02:00.780> was<00:02:01.079> just<00:02:01.380> really

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
because the tomahawk was just really

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.569 
because the tomahawk was just really
easy<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.640> use<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:03.439> it<00:02:04.439> was<00:02:04.619> pretty<00:02:05.070> much<00:02:05.310> heat

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
easy to use and it was pretty much heat

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:06.830 
easy to use and it was pretty much heat
seeking

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
seeking

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.320 
seeking
and<00:02:06.960> one<00:02:07.829> thing<00:02:07.859> that<00:02:08.459> I<00:02:08.489> don't<00:02:08.910> really<00:02:09.030> like

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
and one thing that I don't really like

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.530 
and one thing that I don't really like
about<00:02:09.509> modern<00:02:10.319> warfare<00:02:10.500> 3<00:02:10.679> is<00:02:11.250> that<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:12.360> have

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
about modern warfare 3 is that you have

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.690 
about modern warfare 3 is that you have
to<00:02:12.569> level<00:02:12.930> up<00:02:13.230> pretty<00:02:13.530> high<00:02:13.620> or<00:02:14.099> not<00:02:14.370> that<00:02:14.550> high

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
to level up pretty high or not that high

nothing only and kill confirmed is which
is<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:49.680> game<00:03:49.859> type<00:03:50.069> i'm<00:03:50.250> playing<00:03:50.459> now<00:03:50.609> is

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
is the game type i'm playing now is

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.409 
is the game type i'm playing now is
honestly<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.950> best<00:03:53.220> game<00:03:53.489> type<00:03:53.730> I've<00:03:54.060> played

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:54.419 
honestly the best game type I've played

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:57.080 
honestly the best game type I've played
so<00:03:54.599> far<00:03:54.630> I<00:03:55.169> haven't<00:03:56.160> played<00:03:56.430> too<00:03:56.609> much<00:03:56.790> Search

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
so far I haven't played too much Search

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.650 
so far I haven't played too much Search
and<00:03:57.209> Destroy<00:03:57.500> but<00:03:58.500> I<00:03:59.010> think<00:03:59.519> this<00:03:59.669> is<00:03:59.730> the<00:04:00.209> best

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
and Destroy but I think this is the best

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.860 
and Destroy but I think this is the best
game<00:04:00.870> tight<00:04:01.139> because<00:04:01.910> it's<00:04:02.910> honestly<00:04:03.510> fun<00:04:03.750> to

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
game tight because it's honestly fun to

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.229 
game tight because it's honestly fun to
do<00:04:04.049> because<00:04:04.410> all<00:04:04.950> you<00:04:05.069> do<00:04:05.190> just<00:04:05.430> collect<00:04:05.760> dog

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
do because all you do just collect dog

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.839 
do because all you do just collect dog
tags<00:04:06.540> as<00:04:06.840> in<00:04:07.169> you<00:04:07.319> confirmed<00:04:07.709> kills<00:04:07.950> and<00:04:08.280> it's

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
tags as in you confirmed kills and it's

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.599 
tags as in you confirmed kills and it's
pretty<00:04:09.120> easy<00:04:09.299> to<00:04:09.480> get<00:04:09.959> dog<00:04:10.950> tags<00:04:11.280> when<00:04:11.489> your

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
pretty easy to get dog tags when your

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:13.610 
pretty easy to get dog tags when your
knife<00:04:11.730> only<00:04:11.910> because<00:04:12.450> when<00:04:13.019> you<00:04:13.139> step<00:04:13.349> back<00:04:13.470> at

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
knife only because when you step back at

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.259 
knife only because when you step back at
you<00:04:13.799> pretty<00:04:13.950> much<00:04:14.130> already<00:04:14.519> collect<00:04:15.000> a<00:04:15.060> dog

you pretty much already collect a dog

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.729 
you pretty much already collect a dog
tag<00:04:15.510> but<00:04:17.510> plain<00:04:18.510> kill<00:04:18.840> confirmed
