00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 good and francis vachon I am 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.490
 press photographer and I would like you 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.899
 demonstrate how easy it is 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.069
 use google to find 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.019
 pictures that we have published on 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.940
 internet and that others use without 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.290
 our permission on the left I fear 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.170
 it's good it's internet 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.430
 right this google images this is a 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.770
 picture of regis labeaume that I have 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.380
 carried out in 2007 while he was a 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.060
 new candidate perfectly unknown if 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.840
 I click to see it in high 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.539
 resolution 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.480
 I just have to drag move or 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.969
 a commonly called drag and drop of 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.130
 the image to the search area of 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.690
 google images that gets you 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.200
 see it was 10 who now from europe 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.520
 imagine I release the google mouse 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.579
 images will perform the search 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.739
 reversed in the first results 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.420
 obviously these are these monsters unless 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.579
 so there is no problem here 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.829
 but from the second goal we see 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.640
 that pediatric cyclo hunt ya dot com 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.699
 use the photo without permission 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.410
 by clicking I see that the photo of 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.989
 governed actually governed labeaume himself has 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.500
 been diverted to be integrated 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.790
 in a montage it demonstrates the power 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.040
 google images when they perform 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.689
 searches are not just about 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.990
 the name of the file where are the data 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.850
 iptc of the camera or the serial number 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.610
 the camera and the tourist rather annals 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.700
 very powerful rhythm that allows for 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.950
 check if the photo has been cropped 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.439
 colors were changed if she was 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.130
 embedded in a new image etc etc 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.049
 so a second page 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.409
 there are several others who 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.350
 use the photo on the third page in 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.810
 have another example of the photo that has 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.360
 been integrated into a fitting right here 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.299
 if I click the photo been cropped 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.759
 slightly and she was riding with a 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.220
 photo of angry data so again a 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.710
 times it's extremely powerful like 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.159
 tool you do not have to 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.820
 to perform the operation via your site 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.590
 internet you have pictures on your 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.600
 computers in any folder 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.119
 you can do the same operation 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.740
 so you're dragging it from 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.360
 the image that is on your drive 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:15.470
 hard going gogol images that will put the 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.870
 online photo temporarily 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.810
 only to do the checking and 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:24.640
 he will give you the same results 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.640
 Here it is that simple
