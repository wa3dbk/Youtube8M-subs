9 by 13 inch glass pan now you can use

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:13.490 
9 by 13 inch glass pan now you can use
the<00:04:10.530> aluminum<00:04:11.010> pan<00:04:11.280> it's<00:04:11.609> fine<00:04:11.970> but<00:04:12.959> I<00:04:12.989> decided

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
the aluminum pan it's fine but I decided

the aluminum pan it's fine but I decided
to<00:04:13.680> do<00:04:13.889> the<00:04:14.010> glass<00:04:14.280> if<00:04:14.849> you're<00:04:15.060> gonna<00:04:15.180> do<00:04:15.450> the

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
to do the glass if you're gonna do the

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.379 
to do the glass if you're gonna do the
aluminum<00:04:16.079> pan<00:04:16.380> you<00:04:16.620> have<00:04:16.829> to<00:04:17.039> put<00:04:17.280> up<00:04:17.549> at<00:04:17.789> oven

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
aluminum pan you have to put up at oven

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.890 
aluminum pan you have to put up at oven
preheat<00:04:18.900> the<00:04:19.019> oven<00:04:19.049> at<00:04:19.560> 350<00:04:20.400> degrees<00:04:20.639> if<00:04:21.599> it's

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
preheat the oven at 350 degrees if it's

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.260 
preheat the oven at 350 degrees if it's
aluminum<00:04:22.440> if<00:04:23.070> it's<00:04:23.370> glass<00:04:23.550> you<00:04:23.940> have<00:04:23.970> to

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
aluminum if it's glass you have to

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.960 
aluminum if it's glass you have to
decrease<00:04:24.630> 25<00:04:25.169> so<00:04:25.440> the<00:04:25.949> oven<00:04:26.340> we're<00:04:26.550> gonna<00:04:26.639> turn

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
decrease 25 so the oven we're gonna turn

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.029 
decrease 25 so the oven we're gonna turn
it<00:04:27.090> to<00:04:27.210> 325<00:04:27.930> which<00:04:28.139> actually<00:04:28.830> should<00:04:28.949> have

I<00:05:14.390> like<00:05:15.390> to<00:05:15.540> scrape<00:05:15.780> it<00:05:15.840> in<00:05:16.050> the<00:05:16.140> bottom

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
I like to scrape it in the bottom

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.840 
I like to scrape it in the bottom
because<00:05:16.560> like<00:05:16.770> I<00:05:16.890> said<00:05:16.950> sometimes<00:05:17.400> there's<00:05:17.760> a

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
because like I said sometimes there's a

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.790 
because like I said sometimes there's a
little<00:05:17.940> bit<00:05:18.150> of<00:05:18.240> flour<00:05:18.420> in<00:05:18.720> the<00:05:18.810> bottom<00:05:19.140> so<00:05:19.710> you

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
little bit of flour in the bottom so you

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.220 
little bit of flour in the bottom so you
want<00:05:19.950> to<00:05:20.010> make<00:05:20.130> sure<00:05:20.160> you<00:05:20.430> mix<00:05:20.610> all<00:05:20.820> of<00:05:20.880> that
