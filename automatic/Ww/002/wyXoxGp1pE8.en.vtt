the<00:00:53.280> bottom<00:00:53.670> not<00:00:53.820> sides<00:00:54.649> then<00:00:55.649> what<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.309> do

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
the bottom not sides then what you to do

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.779 
the bottom not sides then what you to do
is<00:00:56.969> place<00:00:57.859> cobblestone<00:00:58.859> there<00:00:59.100> or<00:00:59.370> wherever

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
is place cobblestone there or wherever

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.139 
is place cobblestone there or wherever
you're<00:00:59.940> blocking<00:01:00.629> water<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.850> so<00:01:02.850> it's<00:01:03.000> like

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
you're blocking water and so it's like

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.969 
you're blocking water and so it's like
that<00:01:03.199> and<00:01:04.199> then<00:01:04.290> add<00:01:04.439> another<00:01:04.470> one<00:01:04.860> there<00:01:05.869> then

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
that and then add another one there then

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.030 
that and then add another one there then
put<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.010> redstone<00:01:08.220> repeater<00:01:09.500> redstone<00:01:10.500> dust

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
put a redstone repeater redstone dust

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.870 
put a redstone repeater redstone dust
redstone<00:01:11.790> dust<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:13.189> connect<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.520> here

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
redstone dust and connect it to here

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.469 
redstone dust and connect it to here
then<00:01:15.509> put<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.840> block<00:01:16.110> down<00:01:16.729> so<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.970> should<00:01:18.180> be<00:01:18.299> on

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
then put a block down so it should be on

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.260 
then put a block down so it should be on
but<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.110> piston<00:01:19.439> will<00:01:19.650> not<00:01:19.860> go<00:01:20.610> forward<00:01:20.909> until

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
but the piston will not go forward until

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.890 
but the piston will not go forward until
you<00:01:22.200> go<00:01:22.619> something<00:01:22.950> like<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.630> or<00:01:24.630> like<00:01:24.659> that

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
you go something like that or like that

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.560 
you go something like that or like that
and<00:01:25.290> then<00:01:26.189> now<00:01:26.549> we<00:01:26.610> got<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.970> main<00:01:27.119> idea<00:01:27.240> down

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
and then now we got the main idea down

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.240 
and then now we got the main idea down
so<00:01:27.810> every<00:01:28.049> time<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.560> put<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.799> music<00:01:29.130> disc

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
so every time that you put a music disc

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.160 
so every time that you put a music disc
in<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.670> piston<00:01:30.509> moves<00:01:31.040> and<00:01:32.040> goes<00:01:32.250> back<00:01:32.930> so<00:01:33.930> now

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
in the piston moves and goes back so now

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.760 
in the piston moves and goes back so now
we<00:01:34.560> have<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.770> connect<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.250> our<00:01:35.369> door<00:01:36.770> let's

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
we have to connect to our door let's

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.710 
we have to connect to our door let's
make<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:37.979> go<00:01:38.570> like<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:40.460> then<00:01:41.460> put<00:01:42.360> your<00:01:42.390> cops

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
make it go like that then put your cops

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.910 
make it go like that then put your cops
on<00:01:42.930> up<00:01:43.049> above<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.530> not<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:44.220> one<00:01:45.710> and<00:01:46.710> make

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
on up above that not that one and make

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.170 
on up above that not that one and make
kind<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.280> door<00:01:47.490> shape<00:01:48.079> and<00:01:49.759> now<00:01:50.759> we<00:01:50.820> got<00:01:51.060> the

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
kind of door shape and now we got the

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.410 
kind of door shape and now we got the
main<00:01:51.329> idea<00:01:51.450> down<00:01:51.810> where<00:01:53.149> it<00:01:54.149> opens<00:01:55.189> closes<00:01:56.420> now

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
main idea down where it opens closes now

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.090 
main idea down where it opens closes now
do<00:01:57.990> whatever<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.259> want<00:01:58.350> like<00:01:58.649> I'm<00:01:58.829> just<00:01:58.890> going

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.880 
to cover it up because no one really
likes<00:02:01.110> seeing<00:02:01.350> all<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.649> redstone<00:02:02.460> stuff

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
likes seeing all that redstone stuff

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.779 
likes seeing all that redstone stuff
maybe<00:02:05.659> cover<00:02:06.659> up<00:02:06.840> this<00:02:07.140> or<00:02:07.799> actually<00:02:08.640> home

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
nice that it like CA say it's like that

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.550 
nice that it like CA say it's like that
in<00:02:21.370> your<00:02:21.460> jukebox<00:02:21.670> is<00:02:22.060> there<00:02:22.260> quickly<00:02:23.260> place

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
in your jukebox is there quickly place

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.500 
in your jukebox is there quickly place
and<00:02:23.830> break<00:02:24.040> but<00:02:24.670> if<00:02:26.700> if<00:02:27.700> you're<00:02:27.910> in<00:02:28.000> survival

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
and break but if if you're in survival

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.720 
and break but if if you're in survival
you'll<00:02:29.290> need<00:02:29.470> to<00:02:29.530> place<00:02:29.920> well<00:02:30.370> I<00:02:30.400> guess

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
you'll need to place well I guess

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.720 
you'll need to place well I guess
something<00:02:31.030> you<00:02:31.060> can<00:02:31.240> break<00:02:31.390> really<00:02:31.600> fast<00:02:32.730> but

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
something you can break really fast but

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.540

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
build this and you can also do this with

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.300 
build this and you can also do this with
diamond<00:02:48.820> which<00:02:49.270> would<00:02:49.570> I<00:02:49.600> mean<00:02:50.100> this<00:02:51.100> is<00:02:51.280> a

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
diamond which would I mean this is a

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.960 
diamond which would I mean this is a
block<00:02:51.580> update<00:02:52.090> sector<00:02:52.660> or<00:02:52.870> a<00:02:52.930> bud<00:02:53.470> switch<00:02:53.970> and

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
block update sector or a bud switch and

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.280 
block update sector or a bud switch and
if<00:02:55.480> I<00:02:55.660> have<00:02:55.870> diamond<00:02:56.440> here<00:02:56.680> let's<00:02:57.490> say<00:02:57.790> I<00:02:58.290> have

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
if I have diamond here let's say I have

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.560 
if I have diamond here let's say I have
a<00:02:59.500> diamond<00:02:59.800> pickaxe<00:03:00.160> and<00:03:00.430> you<00:03:01.120> could<00:03:01.270> also<00:03:01.390> do

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
a diamond pickaxe and you could also do

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.449 
a diamond pickaxe and you could also do
this<00:03:01.690> with<00:03:01.750> traps<00:03:02.170> say<00:03:02.410> maybe<00:03:02.709> this<00:03:03.280> will<00:03:03.430> be

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
this with traps say maybe this will be

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.350
