00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
running what 19 Sprint Cup races but we

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.270 
running what 19 Sprint Cup races but we
had<00:02:24.700> planned<00:02:25.060> to<00:02:25.150> run<00:02:25.330> 17<00:02:25.900> originally<00:02:26.440> but<00:02:27.250> now

had planned to run 17 originally but now

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.030 
had planned to run 17 originally but now
I<00:02:27.430> think<00:02:27.880> we<00:02:27.940> picked<00:02:28.180> up<00:02:28.390> two<00:02:28.600> more<00:02:28.750> inches

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
I think we picked up two more inches

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.500 
I think we picked up two more inches
because<00:02:30.040> of<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.370> 500<00:02:30.580> you<00:02:31.270> know<00:02:31.390> obviously

there<00:04:55.250> but<00:04:55.520> seeing<00:04:56.270> your<00:04:56.420> performance<00:04:57.020> at

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
there but seeing your performance at

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.920 
there but seeing your performance at
Daytona<00:04:57.980> I<00:04:58.370> guess<00:04:58.910> that's<00:04:59.180> that<00:04:59.270> there's<00:04:59.840> a

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
Daytona I guess that's that there's a

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.510 
Daytona I guess that's that there's a
lot<00:05:00.050> of<00:05:00.110> similarities<00:05:00.830> between<00:05:00.920> Talladega

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
lot of similarities between Talladega

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.280 
lot of similarities between Talladega
and<00:05:01.640> Daytona<00:05:02.060> do<00:05:02.240> you<00:05:02.330> think<00:05:02.510> that's<00:05:02.690> giving

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 
and Daytona do you think that's giving

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:04.780 
and Daytona do you think that's giving
you<00:05:03.320> an<00:05:03.410> advantage<00:05:03.710> going<00:05:04.040> into<00:05:04.220> the<00:05:04.400> Aaron's

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
you an advantage going into the Aaron's

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.120 
you an advantage going into the Aaron's
dream<00:05:04.970> weekend<00:05:05.530> yeah<00:05:06.530> for<00:05:06.770> sure<00:05:06.830> I<00:05:07.010> mean

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
dream weekend yeah for sure I mean

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.650 
dream weekend yeah for sure I mean
that's<00:05:07.670> the<00:05:07.880> reason<00:05:08.120> we're<00:05:08.210> actually<00:05:08.390> running

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660

this<00:05:37.790> year<00:05:37.850> since<00:05:38.180> I<00:05:38.330> repaid<00:05:38.690> it<00:05:38.930> was<00:05:39.380> a<00:05:39.410> lot

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
this year since I repaid it was a lot

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.010 
this year since I repaid it was a lot
like<00:05:40.250> patología<00:05:40.850> race<00:05:41.000> and<00:05:41.240> I've<00:05:41.360> ever<00:05:41.690> occur

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
like patología race and I've ever occur

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.480 
like patología race and I've ever occur
one<00:05:42.200> time<00:05:42.380> in<00:05:42.500> the<00:05:42.530> Nationwide<00:05:43.010> Series<00:05:43.040> I

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
one time in the Nationwide Series I

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.970 
one time in the Nationwide Series I
think<00:05:43.520> we<00:05:43.730> finished<00:05:44.030> 11th<00:05:44.530> and<00:05:45.530> then<00:05:45.770> I've

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:45.980 
think we finished 11th and then I've

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.490 
think we finished 11th and then I've
never<00:05:46.520> tested<00:05:47.030> well<00:05:47.270> tested<00:05:47.630> at<00:05:47.720> one<00:05:47.900> time<00:05:48.080> so

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500 
never tested well tested at one time so

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.010 
never tested well tested at one time so
not<00:05:49.220> a<00:05:49.250> whole<00:05:49.520> lot<00:05:49.670> to<00:05:49.820> track<00:05:50.030> down<00:05:50.240> there<00:05:50.480> but

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
not a whole lot to track down there but

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.810 
not a whole lot to track down there but
Tuareg<00:05:51.740> is<00:05:51.830> one<00:05:51.980> of<00:05:52.070> the<00:05:52.130> tracks<00:05:52.370> where<00:05:52.640> if<00:05:52.700> you

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:52.820 
Tuareg is one of the tracks where if you

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.340 
Tuareg is one of the tracks where if you
know<00:05:52.940> how<00:05:53.060> to<00:05:53.090> trap<00:05:53.420> you<00:05:53.630> can<00:05:53.780> do<00:05:53.930> it<00:05:54.110> you<00:05:54.230> know

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:54.350 
know how to trap you can do it you know

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.350 
know how to trap you can do it you know
you<00:05:54.440> can<00:05:54.740> get<00:05:54.860> around<00:05:55.040> there<00:05:55.310> not<00:05:55.940> so<00:05:56.060> much<00:05:56.210> the

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 
you can get around there not so much the

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.820 
you can get around there not so much the
track<00:05:56.600> is<00:05:56.810> hard<00:05:56.960> to<00:05:57.050> drive<00:05:57.200> it's<00:05:57.410> really

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
track is hard to drive it's really

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.470 
track is hard to drive it's really
smooth<00:05:58.130> they<00:05:58.280> did<00:05:58.430> a<00:05:58.460> great<00:05:58.640> job<00:05:58.760> pays<00:05:59.210> in<00:05:59.390> it

00:05:59.470 --> 00:05:59.480 
smooth they did a great job pays in it

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.210 
smooth they did a great job pays in it
so<00:05:59.960> it's<00:06:00.050> more<00:06:00.230> so<00:06:00.410> just<00:06:00.440> knowing<00:06:00.740> how<00:06:00.920> to<00:06:00.980> work

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.220 
so it's more so just knowing how to work

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.640 
so it's more so just knowing how to work
the<00:06:01.370> draft<00:06:01.670> and<00:06:01.940> and<00:06:02.210> keep<00:06:03.170> yourself<00:06:03.500> out<00:06:03.590> of

the draft and and keep yourself out of
trouble<00:06:03.770> and<00:06:04.160> and<00:06:04.550> that's<00:06:04.730> going<00:06:04.880> to<00:06:04.970> watch

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
trouble and and that's going to watch

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.430 
trouble and and that's going to watch
those<00:06:05.360> be<00:06:05.570> the<00:06:05.600> pusher<00:06:06.020> the<00:06:06.140> whole<00:06:06.260> race<00:06:06.410> of

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
those be the pusher the whole race of

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.770 
those be the pusher the whole race of
500<00:06:07.250> was<00:06:07.370> just<00:06:07.610> you<00:06:07.970> know<00:06:08.000> I<00:06:08.120> knew<00:06:08.270> I<00:06:08.300> could<00:06:08.570> set

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:08.780 
500 was just you know I knew I could set

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.240 
500 was just you know I knew I could set
a<00:06:08.810> trouble<00:06:09.200> if<00:06:09.260> I<00:06:09.380> was<00:06:09.530> weak<00:06:09.680> on<00:06:09.800> the<00:06:09.920> back<00:06:10.070> and

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.250 
a trouble if I was weak on the back and

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:11.860 
a trouble if I was weak on the back and
I<00:06:10.310> can<00:06:10.460> back<00:06:10.640> off<00:06:10.850> I<00:06:11.150> needed<00:06:11.390> to<00:06:11.510> or<00:06:11.600> whatever

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:11.870 
I can back off I needed to or whatever

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.170 
I can back off I needed to or whatever
so<00:06:12.200> we're<00:06:12.980> kind<00:06:13.160> of<00:06:13.190> going<00:06:13.370> to<00:06:13.640> Talladega

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 
so we're kind of going to Talladega

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.270 
so we're kind of going to Talladega
without<00:06:14.420> same<00:06:14.660> kind<00:06:14.870> of<00:06:14.930> mindset<00:06:15.200> well<00:06:15.740> Trevor
