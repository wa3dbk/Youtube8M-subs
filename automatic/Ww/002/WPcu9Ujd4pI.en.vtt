00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.480
 a school without wanting 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.320
 and let's forget the first page of 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.320

 and as we see there we have extension for 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:44.219
 several browsers like firefox or the 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.399

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.650

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:55.630
 the extension in our browser 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.270
 and we go to the link 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.980
 and there we see that it is downloaded and now 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:06.540
 we have to go 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:08.880
 to the menu to tools and extensions 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.650
 and we will close this page what does not 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.010
 we would give no use 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.780
 and now we just have to be and 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.960
 drag it to the extensions window 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.780
 and drop it 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.030

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.710
 we wait and see that it has loaded what 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.710
 first thing we will do is go to youtube 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.240
 we wait until later 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.910
 and well then nothing else to enter is not desired 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:48.050
 I should not follow a cross here 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.050

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:10.440
 I take it from you, you can try it and 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.220
 then we can remove the play icon 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.220
 of the title 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.600
 and in that several things you will only have to 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.760
 you 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.700

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.170
 color of the player and then we can 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.860
 remove the banners from the videos 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.010

 configure the external producers of 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.180
