00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.639
 I'm clear and I'm going to talk about the 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.400
 inches and what children are bedbugs 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.830
 they are the little squares and of little ones they measure 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.480
 an inch that's why they are called inches that 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.039
 is a word in English and translation 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.260
 in Spanish it is inch and these mini 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.000
 squares 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.730
 are usually collected are usually 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.219
 exchange oneself also the 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.860
 can do and the challenge is that 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.820
 you can only work within that 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.100
 miniature square there you can paint 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:44.520
 there you can paste some kind of material 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.239
 make compositions and the truth is that 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.219
 they are super cool we can make paintings 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.710
 that follow the same theme or the same 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.440
 color and what I'm going to show you now 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.850
 it's a composition that I made to see from a 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.879
 very simple very simple thing is 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.120
 just to give you a little bit of 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.309
 vidilla to the video 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.180
 and so it's a bit and just in case 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:10.420
 serves as inspiration here in these I have not 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.119
 painted I like to paint also like this 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.390
 in miniature I love but thinking a 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:18.930
 little to explain what a punny is 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:23.409
 and for you to see it can be done this 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.210
 Case the bag I do not know how I want it 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.509
 simply call so you can give him a 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.720
 look and I'll also show you some 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.610
 that they gave me for halloween well no 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.460
 it's not that they paid me is that they made a 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.770
 exchange of inches and well it was 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.789
 in a group of those so much that I'm 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:45.070
 put this that everyone did two 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:46.659
 to exchange and then to me 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.550
 played exchange with two girls 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.550
 that I made two for each plus two for 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.679
 I usually do in series worth and 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.170
 a little bit in a row and always being a 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:58.810
 everything is not the same theme as 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.250
 if you were for yourself, be like 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.850
 if you were a decoration composition 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.920
 for yourself but to exchange 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.520
 well anything you also have more 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.860
 information about the inches in my blog 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.500
 www uve creative cloud dotcom dale a 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.890
 look and well now I show you and I 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.170
 I put it here I have everything for 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.360
 work the inches these are the ones that I 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.400
 I told you I was going to teach this I 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.010
 they gave in an exchange this I made them 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.690
 me when I 'm always going to exchange 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.270
 I put the same thing that I do with the 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.730
 artistic and dinkar it's worth the 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.709
 title the author the series and the year this 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.700
 it's when they're going to be good 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.920
 interchangeable 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.660
 and these are those who have sent me 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.700
 they can 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:49.490
 to be even greater than an inch this as 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.730
 I told them in the intro and now you go 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.730
 Let's see 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.780
 what I'm going to do is super simple and 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:03.659
 I cut these from there and now it 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:07.560
 I'm going to do the editing I'm going to use some 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:10.890
 little leaves of these I have a die that 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.079
 you already measure me an inch that also 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.409
 you can cut out I do not have the hand now 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:17.659
 but I have one that I made that cuts 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:21.060
 with a guillotine 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:24.480
 well I also have here pads 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:28.140
 that I'm going to use, you 'll see glue 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.269
 just in case double-sided and good to me 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.629
 I'm going to work on camera 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.629
 fast 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.710
