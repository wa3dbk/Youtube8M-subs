00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
engine is a new in for us

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.819 
engine is a new in for us
it<00:01:53.399> lines<00:01:53.880> up<00:01:54.180> becoming<00:01:54.720> an<00:01:55.049> engine<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.409> has

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829

to<00:01:56.040> have<00:01:56.189> performance<00:01:56.850> features<00:01:57.270> very<00:01:57.630> much

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
to have performance features very much

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.289 
to have performance features very much
like<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.080> gasoline<00:01:58.710> engine<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.250> five<00:01:59.759> liter<00:02:00.000> v8

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
like a gasoline engine the five liter v8

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.929 
like a gasoline engine the five liter v8
is<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.600> right<00:02:00.810> balance<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.500> fuel<00:02:02.310> economy<00:02:02.549> and

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
is the right balance of fuel economy and

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.350 
is the right balance of fuel economy and
that<00:02:03.630> diesel<00:02:04.140> pickup<00:02:04.860> performance<00:02:05.789> that<00:02:06.210> the

that diesel pickup performance that the

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.020 
that diesel pickup performance that the
customers<00:02:06.810> want

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.540

in<00:02:15.709> a<00:02:16.160> new<00:02:16.370> Nissan<00:02:17.120> Titan<00:02:17.510> pick<00:02:17.930> up<00:02:18.370> we<00:02:19.370> go

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
in a new Nissan Titan pick up we go

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.670 
in a new Nissan Titan pick up we go
through<00:02:19.670> a<00:02:19.730> very<00:02:19.910> extensive<00:02:20.209> testing<00:02:20.930> and<00:02:21.140> the

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
field testing is a big piece of that so

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.600 
field testing is a big piece of that so
by<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:23.780> time<00:02:24.020> we<00:02:24.080> launch<00:02:24.530> with<00:02:24.950> Nissan<00:02:25.400> we

by the time we launch with Nissan we

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.250 
by the time we launch with Nissan we
will<00:02:25.730> have<00:02:25.850> accumulated<00:02:26.360> about<00:02:26.600> four<00:02:27.050> million

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
will have accumulated about four million

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.070 
will have accumulated about four million
