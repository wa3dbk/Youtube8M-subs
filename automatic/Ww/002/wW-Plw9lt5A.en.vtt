on our stress defense shield which is

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.670 
on our stress defense shield which is
serotonin<00:05:36.820> I<00:05:37.390> noticed<00:05:38.140> that<00:05:38.320> something<00:05:38.650> was

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
serotonin I noticed that something was

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.380 
serotonin I noticed that something was
going<00:05:38.920> on<00:05:39.070> with<00:05:39.250> that<00:05:39.400> like<00:05:39.880> it<00:05:40.000> just<00:05:40.030> builds

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390 
going on with that like it just builds

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.900 
going on with that like it just builds
up<00:05:40.570> a<00:05:40.720> barrier<00:05:40.990> to<00:05:41.200> the<00:05:41.380> stress<00:05:41.740> now<00:05:42.670> that's

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
up a barrier to the stress now that's

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.100 
up a barrier to the stress now that's
that's<00:05:43.270> really<00:05:43.360> important<00:05:43.810> to<00:05:43.870> learn<00:05:43.990> how

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
that's really important to learn how

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.450 
that's really important to learn how
many<00:05:44.260> people<00:05:44.470> know<00:05:44.590> about<00:05:44.620> serotonin<00:05:45.100> or

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
many people know about serotonin or

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.760 
many people know about serotonin or
heard<00:05:45.670> about<00:05:45.730> it<00:05:46.030> before<00:05:46.180> the<00:05:47.170> more<00:05:47.440> search

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
heard about it before the more search

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.530 
heard about it before the more search
effort<00:05:48.280> by<00:05:48.340> the<00:05:48.370> way<00:05:48.550> every<00:05:49.060> single

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540

living thing on the earth even bacteria

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.920 
living thing on the earth even bacteria
produces<00:05:51.520> serotonin<00:05:52.000> how<00:05:52.450> many<00:05:52.570> people<00:05:52.810> do

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
produces serotonin how many people do

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.370 
produces serotonin how many people do
that<00:05:54.450> every<00:05:55.450> living<00:05:55.690> thing<00:05:55.810> on<00:05:56.140> the<00:05:56.260> earth

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380 
that every living thing on the earth

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.420 
that every living thing on the earth
produces<00:05:57.250> serotonin<00:05:57.490> even<00:05:58.150> bacteria<00:05:59.100> so<00:06:00.100> as

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
produces serotonin even bacteria so as

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.520 
produces serotonin even bacteria so as
you<00:06:01.060> know<00:06:01.090> we<00:06:01.450> think<00:06:01.720> there's<00:06:01.960> one<00:06:02.020> is<00:06:02.230> justin

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.530 
you know we think there's one is justin

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:03.990 
you know we think there's one is justin
us<00:06:02.650> it<00:06:02.770> is<00:06:02.890> not<00:06:03.070> just<00:06:03.310> in<00:06:03.490> US<00:06:03.610> for<00:06:03.970> example

waist diner understood the world is not

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.270 
waist diner understood the world is not
like<00:06:32.020> everything<00:06:32.500> is<00:06:32.620> like<00:06:32.650> these<00:06:32.860> different

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 
like everything is like these different

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.830 
like everything is like these different
categories<00:06:33.790> or<00:06:33.910> different<00:06:34.180> things<00:06:34.210> he

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:34.840 
categories or different things he

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.820 
categories or different things he
understood<00:06:35.230> everything<00:06:35.650> is<00:06:35.860> a<00:06:35.890> frequency<00:06:36.580> and

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:37.830 
understood everything is a frequency and

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.020 
understood everything is a frequency and
so<00:06:38.830> certain<00:06:39.160> things<00:06:39.340> are<00:06:39.430> in<00:06:39.550> that<00:06:39.670> frequency

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.030 
so certain things are in that frequency

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.280 
so certain things are in that frequency
in<00:06:40.150> certain<00:06:40.390> things<00:06:40.510> earn<00:06:40.630> another<00:06:40.900> frequency

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:41.290 
in certain things earn another frequency

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:43.110 
in certain things earn another frequency
like<00:06:41.470> sick<00:06:42.010> little<00:06:42.310> silver<00:06:42.760> bucket

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 
like sick little silver bucket

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.740 
like sick little silver bucket
frequencies<00:06:43.600> the<00:06:43.780> moon<00:06:45.330> that<00:06:46.330> you've<00:06:46.600> got

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:46.750 
frequencies the moon that you've got

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.660 
frequencies the moon that you've got
that<00:06:46.960> okay<00:06:47.680> so<00:06:47.740> this<00:06:47.980> is<00:06:48.160> not<00:06:48.250> some<00:06:48.400> super

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:48.670 
that okay so this is not some super

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:50.670 
that okay so this is not some super
fascinating<00:06:48.880> so<00:06:49.600> we<00:06:49.720> just<00:06:49.810> and<00:06:50.200> also<00:06:50.530> that's

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:50.680 
fascinating so we just and also that's

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.320 
fascinating so we just and also that's
on<00:06:50.770> the<00:06:50.860> same<00:06:51.040> frequency<00:06:51.550> has<00:06:51.640> spring<00:06:52.060> water

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:52.330 
on the same frequency has spring water

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.110 
on the same frequency has spring water

as comes out ice cold those are all the
same<00:06:57.730> frequency<00:06:58.390> and<00:06:58.600> I<00:06:59.140> can<00:06:59.290> do<00:06:59.380> a<00:06:59.410> whole<00:06:59.470> a

00:06:59.880 --> 00:06:59.890 
same frequency and I can do a whole a

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:02.010 
same frequency and I can do a whole a
whole<00:07:00.070> seminar<00:07:00.640> on<00:07:01.000> that<00:07:01.390> I<00:07:01.570> do<00:07:01.630> occasionally

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:02.020 
whole seminar on that I do occasionally

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.020 
whole seminar on that I do occasionally
just<00:07:02.320> on<00:07:02.590> the<00:07:02.890> different<00:07:03.280> octaves<00:07:03.460> of<00:07:03.820> things

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:04.030 
just on the different octaves of things

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:05.850 
just on the different octaves of things
because<00:07:04.300> some<00:07:04.810> people<00:07:05.110> don't<00:07:05.140> understand

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:05.860 
because some people don't understand

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.200 
because some people don't understand
things<00:07:06.100> in<00:07:06.220> the<00:07:06.310> linear<00:07:06.550> way<00:07:06.850> that<00:07:07.000> we've<00:07:07.120> been

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:07.210 
things in the linear way that we've been

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:08.460 
things in the linear way that we've been

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:10.330 
that way the more of the octaves like
