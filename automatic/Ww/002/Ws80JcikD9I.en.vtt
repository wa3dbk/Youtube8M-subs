00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.099
 server name will not talk about it 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:15.929
 then many want to always name 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:19.250
 server and not as usual this 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.650
 you their server one on the hosting another 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:26.869

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:31.260
 This address is in place stringent and camps 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:35.070
 here's how to do that 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.239
 not a paragraph and not a symbol like as 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:51.449

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:53.579

 if you don't know 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.950
 color range so I usually choose with 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:38.540
 zero to seven because they sort of 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:49.259
