because<00:01:42.329> again<00:01:42.689> that's<00:01:42.810> going<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.140> reduce<00:01:43.259> the

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
because again that's going to reduce the

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.550 
because again that's going to reduce the
stickiness<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.869> we're<00:01:46.200> going<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.380> stick

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
stickiness of it so we're going to stick

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.240 
stickiness of it so we're going to stick

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
it kind of just starts to bend on its

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.470 
it kind of just starts to bend on its
own<00:02:10.379> now<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.250> whole<00:02:11.520> point<00:02:11.790> of<00:02:12.000> this<00:02:12.150> is<00:02:12.420> that

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
own now the whole point of this is that

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.600 
own now the whole point of this is that
it<00:02:13.200> kind<00:02:13.440> of

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
it kind of

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.310

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
keeps them lasting for such a long time

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.630 
keeps them lasting for such a long time
right<00:02:18.230> I<00:02:18.470> know<00:02:18.830> that<00:02:18.860> that's<00:02:19.130> ready<00:02:19.430> because

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
right I know that that's ready because

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.970 
right I know that that's ready because

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
you that I have tried this on my fingers

you that I have tried this on my fingers
and<00:03:08.480> my<00:03:08.690> toes<00:03:08.930> and<00:03:09.370> I<00:03:10.370> would<00:03:10.820> say<00:03:10.970> the<00:03:11.120> only

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
and my toes and I would say the only

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.900 
and my toes and I would say the only
thing<00:03:11.360> is<00:03:11.570> it<00:03:11.810> perhaps<00:03:11.989> lasts<00:03:12.590> about<00:03:12.709> up<00:03:13.640> to<00:03:13.880> a

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
thing is it perhaps lasts about up to a

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.390 
thing is it perhaps lasts about up to a
week<00:03:14.209> and<00:03:14.959> on<00:03:15.110> the<00:03:15.230> toes<00:03:15.500> I<00:03:15.709> have<00:03:15.860> mine<00:03:16.070> on<00:03:16.100> for

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
week and on the toes I have mine on for

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.100 
week and on the toes I have mine on for
three<00:03:16.670> weeks<00:03:16.940> and<00:03:17.150> they<00:03:17.690> didn't<00:03:17.930> actually

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
three weeks and they didn't actually

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.190 
three weeks and they didn't actually
come<00:03:18.470> off<00:03:18.680> what<00:03:19.580> happened<00:03:20.000> was<00:03:20.180> the<00:03:20.690> distance

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
come off what happened was the distance

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.580 
come off what happened was the distance
between<00:03:21.640> kind<00:03:22.640> of<00:03:22.730> my<00:03:22.820> cuticle<00:03:23.420> here<00:03:23.720> and<00:03:23.989> the

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
between kind of my cuticle here and the

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.740 
between kind of my cuticle here and the
bottom<00:03:24.980> of<00:03:25.070> the<00:03:25.160> sticker<00:03:25.459> became<00:03:26.030> too<00:03:26.420> much

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
bottom of the sticker became too much

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.890 
bottom of the sticker became too much
and<00:03:27.220> so<00:03:28.220> they<00:03:28.310> kind<00:03:28.519> of<00:03:28.580> grew<00:03:28.940> out<00:03:29.090> Sweeney

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
and so they kind of grew out Sweeney

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.660 
and so they kind of grew out Sweeney
energies<00:03:30.200> peel<00:03:30.440> them<00:03:30.590> off<00:03:30.709> now<00:03:31.130> to<00:03:31.190> take<00:03:31.489> them
