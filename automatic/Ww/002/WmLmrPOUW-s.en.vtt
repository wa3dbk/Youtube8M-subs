ingredients<00:00:54.710> so<00:00:55.710> I've<00:00:55.949> kind<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.309> decided<00:00:56.610> that

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
ingredients so I've kind of decided that

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.299 
ingredients so I've kind of decided that
it<00:00:57.360> might<00:00:57.510> not<00:00:57.690> be<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:57.870> bad<00:00:58.289> because<00:00:59.390> they're

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
it might not be that bad because they're

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.709 
it might not be that bad because they're
so<00:01:02.309> people<00:01:02.640> say<00:01:02.760> cones<00:01:03.059> are<00:01:03.300> bad<00:01:03.420> for<00:01:03.600> your

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719

so people say cones are bad for your
hair<00:01:03.930> but<00:01:04.199> there<00:01:04.350> are<00:01:04.589> people<00:01:04.769> who<00:01:04.949> say<00:01:05.159> you

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369

ninety seven percent of Americans say
that<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.470> goes<00:01:55.619> through<00:01:55.680> their<00:01:56.250> skin<00:01:58.159> I<00:01:59.270> don't

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
that it goes through their skin I don't

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.330 
that it goes through their skin I don't
think<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.750> side<00:02:01.020> effects<00:02:01.350> of<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.860> bad<00:02:02.130> but

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
think the side effects of that bad but

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.679 
think the side effects of that bad but
if<00:02:02.430> something<00:02:02.759> is<00:02:02.820> going<00:02:03.060> through<00:02:03.240> your<00:02:03.299> skin

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
if something is going through your skin

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.749 
if something is going through your skin
that's<00:02:03.899> probably<00:02:04.229> not<00:02:04.439> good<00:02:05.430> but<00:02:05.670> again

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
that's probably not good but again

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.169 
that's probably not good but again
that's<00:02:06.270> right<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.810> bottom<00:02:07.140> so<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:08.369> don't<00:02:09.000> know

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
that's right the bottom so I don't know

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.029 
that's right the bottom so I don't know
if<00:02:09.239> I'm<00:02:09.450> too<00:02:09.660> worried<00:02:10.020> about<00:02:10.259> that<00:02:10.470> because<00:02:10.679> of

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
if I'm too worried about that because of

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.090 
if I'm too worried about that because of
weight<00:02:11.310> actually<00:02:11.730> does

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
weight actually does

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
weight actually does
my<00:02:12.310> hair<00:02:12.550> and<00:02:16.890> was<00:02:17.890> there<00:02:18.160> another<00:02:18.490> one<00:02:18.730> or<00:02:18.970> the

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
my hair and was there another one or the

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.230 
my hair and was there another one or the
other<00:02:19.240> one<00:02:19.420> I<00:02:19.450> didn't<00:02:19.930> I<00:02:20.020> was<00:02:20.260> I<00:02:21.190> think<00:02:22.120> it<00:02:22.210> was

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
other one I didn't I was I think it was

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:28.340 
other one I didn't I was I think it was
potassium<00:02:23.700> sorbate<00:02:24.930> but<00:02:26.160> that's<00:02:27.160> just<00:02:27.580> I

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
potassium sorbate but that's just I

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.620 
potassium sorbate but that's just I
think<00:02:29.350> it's<00:02:29.590> a<00:02:29.710> preservative<00:02:30.400> or<00:02:31.240> is<00:02:31.390> he<00:02:31.510> an

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
think it's a preservative or is he an

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.850 
think it's a preservative or is he an
acid<00:02:32.050> because<00:02:32.980> there<00:02:33.280> was<00:02:33.460> sodium<00:02:34.000> Ben's

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
acid because there was sodium Ben's

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.710 
acid because there was sodium Ben's
benzoate<00:02:35.860> as<00:02:36.250> well<00:02:36.460> one<00:02:37.270> of<00:02:37.300> them's<00:02:37.570> a

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
benzoate as well one of them's a
