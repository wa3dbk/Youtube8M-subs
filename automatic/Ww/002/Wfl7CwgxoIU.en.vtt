Murphy and the other characters in the

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.920 
Murphy and the other characters in the
game<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:50.370> can<00:00:50.580> move<00:00:51.089> them<00:00:51.300> around<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.720> cover

game you can move them around to cover

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.869 
game you can move them around to cover
positions<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.979> that<00:00:53.010> when<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.489> move<00:00:53.640> another

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
positions so that when you move another

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.350 
positions so that when you move another
character<00:00:54.360> right<00:00:55.940> you<00:00:56.940> can<00:00:57.059> be<00:00:57.150> sure<00:00:57.330> that

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
character right you can be sure that

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.469 
character right you can be sure that
you've<00:00:57.629> got<00:00:57.780> cover<00:00:58.940> here<00:00:59.940> we<00:01:00.030> zoomed<00:01:00.269> out<00:01:00.420> a

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:00.479 
you've got cover here we zoomed out a

little bit you can see that the doorway
is<00:01:02.010> open<00:01:02.100> there<00:01:02.580> so<00:01:02.729> I'm<00:01:02.790> gonna<00:01:02.879> position<00:01:03.089> Joe

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
is open there so I'm gonna position Joe

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.600 
is open there so I'm gonna position Joe
there<00:01:03.839> just<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.110> cover<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.470> doorway<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.370> now

Joe is free to move up through the rest
of<00:01:21.770> the<00:01:21.890> level<00:01:24.490> by<00:01:25.490> using<00:01:25.520> this<00:01:25.910> method<00:01:26.360> he

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
of the level by using this method he

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.050 
of the level by using this method he
rewards<00:01:27.110> smart<00:01:27.440> play<00:01:27.740> you<00:01:28.340> can<00:01:28.610> attack<00:01:28.880> yet

done<00:01:29.300> blazing<00:01:29.840> will<00:01:30.380> that<00:01:30.560> do<00:01:30.860> here

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.510 

but<00:01:35.350> the<00:01:35.470> odds<00:01:35.590> are<00:01:35.770> you'll<00:01:35.979> die<00:01:36.130> so<00:01:36.430> it's

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
but the odds are you'll die so it's

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.130 
but the odds are you'll die so it's
better<00:01:36.670> to<00:01:36.820> work<00:01:37.030> get<00:01:37.510> your<00:01:37.630> squad<00:01:37.869> to<00:01:37.990> work

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
better to work get your squad to work

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.440 
better to work get your squad to work
together<00:01:38.290> and<00:01:38.560> attack<00:01:38.830> the<00:01:38.979> levels<00:01:39.280> so<00:01:40.270> that's

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
together and attack the levels so that's

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.940 
together and attack the levels so that's
the<00:01:40.600> benchmark<00:01:40.840> level<00:01:41.320> that's<00:01:41.530> certainly<00:01:41.890> our

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
the benchmark level that's certainly our

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.649 
the benchmark level that's certainly our

style for the game and here we can see

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.510 
style for the game and here we can see
we've<00:01:43.810> added<00:01:43.960> ambient<00:01:44.920> occlusion<00:01:45.070> to<00:01:45.460> the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
NASA benchmark there which will continue

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.359 
NASA benchmark there which will continue
building<00:01:55.180> more<00:01:55.450> levels<00:01:55.659> into<00:01:55.750> the<00:01:55.899> game<00:01:56.050> with

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
building more levels into the game with

the control system has been over all
this<00:01:59.229> month<00:01:59.530> so<00:01:59.770> that<00:01:59.799> the<00:02:00.009> flag<00:02:00.220> can<00:02:00.399> move<00:02:00.549> in

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
this month so that the flag can move in

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.490 
this month so that the flag can move in
any<00:02:00.850> direction<00:02:00.940> and<00:02:01.840> look<00:02:02.110> in<00:02:02.200> any<00:02:02.290> direction
