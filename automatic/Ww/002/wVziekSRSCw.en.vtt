 hello to all friends welcome to 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.389
 a new video that makes a few 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.590
 time that I slowed down she pace everything 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.310
 just because I had my 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.109
 move 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.960
 I had the breakdown that had smiled because 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.430
 here are lots of little things to my by 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.750
 example my apartment where I spent 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.130
 some time already I had no internet 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.390
 until tonight, by the way, it's for 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.520
 I'm posting this video now 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.399
 finally we'll meet again for the 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.500
 lucky challenge proposed by dark of the chain 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.120
 not a boat production so yes you 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.120
 know him surely seen who does 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.280
 part of the kraft magna what is that 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.140
 I can say more the challenge so it's 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.569
 the lucky challenge that consists of everything 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.780
 simply install the mode that 

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:51.300
 so blocks a very simple mode that 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.499
 is to throw a blog that spawn from 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.969
 from time to time randomly poor 

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:58.559
 popov here and is this block actually there 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.719
 in 400 that will make appear 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.979
 anything but when I say 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.389
 anything is really anything 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:07.049
 what and I leave you the surprise 

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:09.170
 I will not reveal to you what will 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:14.270
 to make it appear that may depend on them 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:17.009
 this is the chance so we will create the map 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.710
 and we will try to survive the most 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.899
 long time possible so we activate the 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:31.680
 cicc because I need it 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:34.439
 here we go and here we go 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.679
 so if I have not said yet you have 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:42.929
 the right to participate to participate 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:46.710
 you just have to write to write 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:48.810
 minecraft the lucky block with your 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.579
 nickname and you send it like that dark 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.060
 to find more easily on 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.159
 Internet 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.530
 so if you want to participate you have to 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:59.490
 simply put an effect so on 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.439
 itself is accelerating it unlimited for 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.479
 can run more easily and so 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.679
 I will put the night no first I 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.799
 will watch if peg in hard 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:11.009
 I'm in hard I go at night and that's 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.270
 let's go we'll try to survive 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.650
 the longest time possible 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:21.409
 let's go ok I'm going 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:23.090
 over there and it's gone jb there is nothing 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:25.970
 who poses as a monster it's weird 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.400
 oh if it's gone it starts ok and 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.909
 dragons so that you see that this is it 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.250
 thing I did not have to do it by 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:35.390
 against it's pretty but hey it's a valve 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.450
 I had to do it phone 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.180
 the fall of cases here I am in the 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.150
 content so we did not know this first 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.640
 I'm going to die quickly 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.739
 it's dead it's over dell and we are 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.200
 left for a second try I entered 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:54.920
 some so if I really do not get 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.989
 and then and then if that's where it is 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:04.010
 beautiful to know against bug I love 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:05.480
 at the crates go we go we kill him ok 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.829
 that's pretty good because I 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.459
 recovers food while seeing that 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:10.400
 I am in hard 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.739
 I need a lot up ok the monsters 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.019
 have started to sport it's going to have to 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.569
 I watch out for the zombies so that's 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.290
 what chicken a zombie look into 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.519
 throws 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:25.879
 which 11.7 throws it off 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:30.799
 it throws it throws it throws ok 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:32.150
 we're going to continue great island that ok 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.949
 we go back for a third time 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.540
 I hope to be really lucky 

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:40.909
 because the city was everything 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:42.739
 simply not possible that's anything what these 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:46.770
 offers months weather all that because 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:48.630
 that it only serves 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.170
 embarrassed in my inventory ok we go there in 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.340
 continuous it's gone a paris blog 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.520
 sinapin closer was not worth it 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.470
 there, it's gone, so I put the 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.970
 shaders for those who wonder because 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.010
 that if not in the night we really see 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.170
 nothing at all and it's just 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.050
 awful we count the little spider we 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.570
 are we going to break what's good 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.130
 otherwise it's totally useless 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.880
 we will touch or tailor to make 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.910
 teacher 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:20.160
 this is beautiful that there is none of 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:23.190
 all of the blogs that sign to mg why 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.760
 not block siliana there are some 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.680
 there we go there hockey arena on there 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.930
 go we go to both without getting 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.430
 touch anything there are some 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.430
 fucking bills had flowered done 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:38.390
 very careful about contours as 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:41.460
 we go we manage we will break both 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:46.350
 aisles paul lalalalalala what the fuck 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:50.250
 look at this shadow it's little that is 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:52.230
 it is at once the great is 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.790
 always better than nothing cost so we 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.870
 keep on going 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.730
 I hope to be really more 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.500
 lucky what to leave the other two 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.180
 first shot but you've seen everything 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.990
 just it's really random a 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.580
 dragon plus the explosion of two I know 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.970
 not even what it was 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:14.070
 the explosion was huge ok it will 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:16.260
 nothing their nap we continue what is it 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.240
 that it's that this house is that 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.450
 it's cool we go I do not know if it's 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.710
 hidden 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:24.900

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.660
 ax so we'll try loose and 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.650

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.940
 except that I do not need all that 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:45.210
 because it would be like nothing so we 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.380
 continue we go to that one good I have 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:46.680

 a great stick and suddenly for 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.230
 the moment the rhythm of the videos is going 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.230
 slow down 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:13.750

 besides the gesture of too much luck 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.900
 because I did when I did some tests 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:36.760
 there are defects that I held six seven 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.560
 minutes but I preferred to show you 

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:42.130
 passages where we danced were 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:43.470
 random so I hope it's this 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.400
