00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.689
 that under copyright so I won't do it 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:36.180
 see how it was made 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:39.300
 take the line, however, on the pan that 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.239
 he can barely see let's put a 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.420
 a little oil see at least a little bit of oil 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.100
 pizza does not stick the pan and 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.649
 spread not too much because the 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.570
 provision too user after smells of oil 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:58.280
 and after it sucks and after the bitterness 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.280
 anger of my guilt in the canons 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.449
 we take pasta , pizza is fields 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.350
 that to 73 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.320
 and while I'm kneading the dough with 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:15.990
 a lot of elegance let's see what 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.789
 will be the ingredients for this pizza 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.909
 a tinned box that avoids the 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:24.970
 beats passed for the beard that I will go 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.759
 to blend the good good mascarpone 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.100
 good that will be spread on the pizza 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.960
 mozzarella from pizza hut ronchi then 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.130
 let's see how it will be processed e 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.590
 finally the magical and powerful spec 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.689
 regarding the quantities e 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.610
 arrange yourself I make eye catchers 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:51.869
 so much needs to be done 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.869
 let's remember genes first of all is 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:02:00.569
 once the pasta is good spending 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.569
 as you can see now here and here 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:05.470
 take the tomato and pass it off 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:09.280
 so not too much I see what too 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:12.549
 work later for those who wrap their stomachs 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.260
 they turned out as they should have been 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:15.850
 a thin club that is 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.139
 enough liquid if it's not enough 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:22.139
