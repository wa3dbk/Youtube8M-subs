00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hi girls of my radio today 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.359
 the mascara will have the butterfly effect of 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.410
 the oreal what you have seen it in 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.389
 very much also because it was one 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.759
 of the most most requested of all is 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.759
 the one with this bottle brush shaped 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.830
 the pipe cleaner a little higher towards 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.340
 the outside and smaller towards 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.930
 the inside to therefore take firm and 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.670
 give the effect just do it when 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.380
 I saw advertising in Italy 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.779
 the thing that smacks of themes you don't have 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.270
 also designed for you eyelash effect mascara 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.940
 that is, with more than you did not ask yourself 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.920
 goodies that are the fiber infected eyelashes 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.829
 with which the market I know I live with 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.500
 whose video made a search with with 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:48.149
 translated into Italian is the bang the bang 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.489
 of the butterfly and that is I don't know if 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.780
 you mean there are fibers on 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.360
 butterfly boss you know he did 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.879
 of silk therefore practically what 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.100
 they take to then make clothes of 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.660
 I don't think of silk with something silk 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.860
 that they are always silk in here is 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.260
 more to say with equal bang from 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.310
 butterfly I do not know I think if these 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.970
 I'm not a hundred percent sure 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.970
 then 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.720
 tend to be with this type of 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.630
 applicator towards the end I tend to 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.950
 bring your eyelashes out a little 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.990
 go straight I go a little slanted 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.810
 slightly then what do you find uncomfortable 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.100
 is that I am usually right with today 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.140
 names tomas strongly a mascara like that 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.760
 then we put scale so obviously not 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.890
 it can be done with this type of mascara 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.330
 because otherwise we don't have this 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.660
 effect so you have to keep it 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:47.150
 on the other hand, therefore, simply me 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.680
 I find it a little more uncomfortable to work 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.380
 all the time with mascara like that 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.330
 or use it with the left where I am 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.640
 really over a little and therefore would not come 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.950
 out of town or anything here 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.450
 in the effect you see that it does not do so many 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.060
 groups because anna formula anyway 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.280
 rather on the liquid kind it lengthens 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.810
 however, it does not give much volume because 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.550
 being so liquid it just doesn't make a 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.590
 little bit but there other thickness 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.270
 so the volume effect is minimal 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.230
 I would say that more than fake eyelashes is 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:17.120
 a slightly more exaggerated natural effect 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.670
 we say that it is not really the effect c 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.459
 10 10 yatches however is very nice as 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.709
 effect obviously for those who are fond of 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.390
 generally not too exaggerated then 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.160
 maybe it's one of those mascara that me 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.630
 I would use it during the day but I wouldn't use it in the evening 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.220
 because in the evening I want maybe 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.890
 something a little more dramatic 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.600
 inside there are 7 ml of product 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.070
 so not much compared to 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.430
 many others but digs with which I have it 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:43.459
 bought as they were 9 10 ml and the price 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.069
 and on the 9 euros and 99 my vote therefore for 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.709
 this product is 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:50.950
 drums seven and a half by seven 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:53.499
 and a half because it is a nice mascara but not 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.790
 it is my mascara of life and we say 

00:02:53.499 --> 00:02:57.219
 which I will surely use more than 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.730
 day just that evening 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:02:59.730
 Hi girls
