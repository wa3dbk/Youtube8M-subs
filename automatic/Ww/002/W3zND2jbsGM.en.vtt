00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 Welcome to the duel 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.210
 in a sense, classic sennheiser 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.300
 radio distance against the combination 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.730
 smartphone and the new red smart life 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.769
 The question is, I really always have to 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.870
 even if I record the sound optimally 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.550
 for example, wants to go with a video 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.410
 Its expensive radio link work 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.240
 has its price so well 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.460
 between 500 and 700 euros 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.140
 you have to lay there already on the table 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.970
 yes, how is it all? 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.949
 did not exist earlier 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.720
 small recording devices which one then 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.489
 Like a smartphone today in your pocket 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.620
 could be stuck so that was why 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.320
 for years then the procedure always so 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.579
 you just hear the sound to the camera where he 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.460
 then recorded 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.469
 besides, it was difficult then one 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.700
 separate soundtrack with the picture track 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.020
 to get in sync 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.969
 Of course that's a problem as well 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.570
 modern editing software like final cut 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.460
 per 10 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.590
 for example, that dominates it 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.940
 no problem is the sound separately 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.000
 record herewith 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.370
 with this smart life for 50 euros yes 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.050
 But just how is the quality 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.629
 So I speak, I now here 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.430
 all the time over the sennheiser microphone 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.090
 and now I would just take one 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.640
 start recording 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:15.960
 and right now you'll be talking about that 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.060
 cheap 50 euro smartlab from roth is 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.590
 the question is really so much different 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.360
 I'm curious myself, I would 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.640
 right now not like that at the 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.220
 post- processing sounds so decide 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.759
 even this is really good for her 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.140
 purposes 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.240
 if you like that a little 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.790
 quality to look so the cable here 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.100
 that is in comparison to the sennheiser 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.590
 Variation significantly thinner so that looks 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.700
 not really like that 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.189
 really really durable so that is 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.450
 Of course, one of the smears you 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.950
 if you have to do it if you are natural 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.170
 on the other hand, only one person pays so little 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.119
 about 50 euro is really synonymous 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.790
 very cheap so that was now 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.170
 sound recorded here with the red 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.549
 own app I can here again 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.350
 Show that there is a free 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.829
 version or in one 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.509
 premium version to pay and 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:06.750
 decides itself the sound is okay for 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.640
 you or not and if you 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.229
 interested are the buy the 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.200
 Smart runs then finds in the video 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.390
 Video description still 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.510
 one link otherwise to the next 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.510
 times
