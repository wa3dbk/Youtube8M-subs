00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
there we kind of talked about he's

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.440 
there we kind of talked about he's
starting<00:01:52.369> to<00:01:52.399> master<00:01:52.849> that<00:01:53.000> and<00:01:53.149> get<00:01:53.269> a<00:01:53.300> little

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
starting to master that and get a little

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.669 
starting to master that and get a little
bit<00:01:53.660> you<00:01:53.750> know<00:01:53.810> how<00:01:53.959> that<00:01:54.140> become<00:01:54.410> a<00:01:54.440> little

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
bit you know how that become a little

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:56.440 
bit you know how that become a little
easy<00:01:54.830> but<00:01:55.580> the<00:01:55.670> nice<00:01:55.819> thing<00:01:55.849> I<00:01:56.149> could<00:01:56.420> think

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
easy but the nice thing I could think

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.600 
easy but the nice thing I could think
about<00:01:56.629> athlean-x<00:01:57.319> is<00:01:57.500> that<00:01:57.679> the<00:01:57.830> exercises

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
about athlean-x is that the exercises

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.279 
about athlean-x is that the exercises
that<00:01:58.640> are<00:01:58.819> in<00:01:58.879> this<00:01:58.940> program<00:01:59.179> now<00:01:59.869> like<00:02:00.110> other

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
that are in this program now like other

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.919 
that are in this program now like other
unique<00:02:00.890> and<00:02:01.129> most<00:02:01.310> of<00:02:01.429> all<00:02:01.550> very<00:02:02.509> different

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 
unique and most of all very different

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:03.910 
unique and most of all very different
from<00:02:02.989> probably<00:02:03.379> some<00:02:03.500> of<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.649> things<00:02:03.800> you've

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
from probably some of the things you've

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.040 
from probably some of the things you've
done<00:02:03.950> in<00:02:04.819> the<00:02:04.970> past<00:02:05.119> or<00:02:05.450> you're<00:02:05.569> used<00:02:05.750> to<00:02:05.840> doing

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
done in the past or you're used to doing

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.960 
done in the past or you're used to doing
but<00:02:06.709> I<00:02:06.769> like<00:02:06.890> Athena<00:02:07.190> they're<00:02:07.580> open-ended

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
but I like Athena they're open-ended

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.839 
but I like Athena they're open-ended
what<00:02:08.869> I<00:02:08.929> mean<00:02:09.080> by<00:02:09.200> that<00:02:09.349> is<00:02:09.560> is<00:02:10.220> your<00:02:10.369> exercises

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
what I mean by that is is your exercises

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.479 
what I mean by that is is your exercises
that<00:02:10.970> can<00:02:11.000> always<00:02:11.300> be<00:02:11.769> made<00:02:12.769> to<00:02:12.920> be<00:02:13.010> harder<00:02:13.459> to

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
that can always be made to be harder to

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.470 
that can always be made to be harder to
adapt<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.030> your<00:02:14.420> level<00:02:14.629> of<00:02:15.200> strength<00:02:15.709> so<00:02:16.480> we

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
adapt to your level of strength so we

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.949 
adapt to your level of strength so we
