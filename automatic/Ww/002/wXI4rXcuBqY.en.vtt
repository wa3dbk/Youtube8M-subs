00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:04.030
 the solution is this 

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.160
 I am a biologist and works in the area of ​​teaching the disciplines of biology and chemistry 

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:13.859
 to be the president of the course of cellular biology that would be ministering 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.869
 on cbm tv website 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:19.119
 so come on 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.489
 the central objectives of our course 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:22.929
 first goal 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:26.519
 is to know and understand the processes of origin and positive evolution in 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.479
 currently known 

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:33.410
 know the cellular organelles and their specialized functions 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.730
 understand the characteristics of usa 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.730
 this is important and essential of cellular processes 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.080
 analyze the process of cell division in detail 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.770
 the content that will be seen during the course 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.770
 we will start from the origin evolution of the cell 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.080
 to study them cell types namely 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.750
 prokaryotic cells eukaryotic cells 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.300
 we will also conquer polygonal markun quotes from the secular constitution 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.190
 the chemical components of the cell 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.490
 the cell death blog division 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.690
 and finally cell death 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.050
 our audience to 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.810
 the course of cell biology is intended for high school students 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.350
 and to life science professionals who were interested 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.610
 in patu years usa 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.610
 or related areas that are interested in the subject that we are going to study 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.740
 the resources 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.740
 we will have a succession of the course of cellular biology 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.230
 we are going to have weekly live imperatives 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.329
 clouds 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.030
 the sites related to the topic studied 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.800
 he has fun 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.760
 the question of the main vestibular of the federal ones in the middle of contests 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.970
 public 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.970
 full course session course material 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.050
 various subsectors studied 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.120
 related videos 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.970
 schemes to facilitate their study 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.530
 in chat to ask questions 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.569
 the duration of the course 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.730
 the biology course has a workload of 40 hours classes with schedules 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.439
 fully flexible forms of participation that can be organized by the 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:17.479
 student 

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:20.429
 and after the beginning or entry of the student 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:24.359
 in the course session you will have the duration of three months rag to 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:26.359
 conclusion 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:30.169
 so it's just some information but under bush cell biology 

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:34.439
 so you can have more detailed information about the course and 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:38.729
 how can you become a subscriber you may be accessing cbm's website 

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:40.219
 had a vote with 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:41.960
 and get more information 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.040
 so welcome
