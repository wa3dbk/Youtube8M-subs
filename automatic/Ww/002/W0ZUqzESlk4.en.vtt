if<00:00:49.750> I<00:00:49.990> can<00:00:50.260> just<00:00:50.530> invert<00:00:50.950> the<00:00:51.130> positron<00:00:51.610> count

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
if I can just invert the positron count

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.430 
if I can just invert the positron count
to<00:00:52.090> coincide<00:00:52.420> with<00:00:52.660> the<00:00:52.960> muffin<00:00:53.260> cell

to coincide with the muffin cell

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.380 
to coincide with the muffin cell
sequencer<00:00:54.010> then<00:00:54.520> maybe<00:00:55.020> just<00:00:56.020> maybe<00:00:57.210> what<00:00:58.210> are

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
sequencer then maybe just maybe what are
