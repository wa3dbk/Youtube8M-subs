it's like glass I can put the like under
them

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.730 

and<00:02:38.380> then<00:02:38.590> this<00:02:38.770> can<00:02:39.340> go<00:02:39.490> at<00:02:39.580> an<00:02:39.670> angle<00:02:40.740> now

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
and then this can go at an angle now

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.050 
and then this can go at an angle now
this<00:02:41.860> looks<00:02:42.130> better<00:02:42.280> this<00:02:42.640> because<00:02:42.940> this

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
this looks better this because this

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.520 
this looks better this because this
one's<00:02:43.210> got<00:02:43.360> all<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.720> things<00:02:43.870> for<00:02:44.170> everything

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
one's got all the things for everything

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:51.030 
one's got all the things for everything
so<00:02:45.400> this<00:02:45.580> will<00:02:45.730> probably<00:02:45.910> be<00:02:46.090> it<00:02:49.860> he's<00:02:50.860> gotta

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
so this will probably be it he's gotta

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.410 
so this will probably be it he's gotta
think<00:02:51.220> for<00:02:51.340> your<00:02:51.460> penance<00:02:51.760> it<00:02:51.940> doesn't<00:02:52.210> fall
