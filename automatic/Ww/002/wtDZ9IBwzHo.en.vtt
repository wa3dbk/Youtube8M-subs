00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.020
 of course I'm about 7 7 7 welcome to this new video of this series in 

00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:09.070
 which every time you come to present two economic players who can be 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.810
 compare players with higher prices 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.139
 stronger kill etc. 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.140
 this time you advised me to make financial help and it was 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.000
 truly a challenge for you it is more difficult than expected to find a burden 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.989
 cheap 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:27.289
 well as always before youtube I declare to recommend below 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.550
 comments another player 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.020
 I say I had to find his economic counterpart 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.570
 it is a last thing and as always it asks me to like this video 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.380
 to have other or pisodi of this series to 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.690
 economic ilaria is 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:42.940
 free 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.660
 But before you tell me everything Cagliari already tell you how he said at the beginning you can 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.510
 finding the economic value was very difficult because you chose 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.880
 own - 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.250
 the first of today is nationality and the championship 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.790
 because if I for one player I could also put another nationality 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.450
 it is enough that it is the same role more or less 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.410
 what is it because the role cannot be changed 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.750
 is not that I do not know if I for example to me TV and buffon goalkeeper case would be 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.770
 wrong all the team that would not have been the right player 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.850
 economic though 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.980
 inexpensive speed buffoons 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.200
 or maybe economic rap doesn't even do what it costs 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.650
 beautiful main reason why he chose not as a nova substitute 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:24.250
 years 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.070
 rt to all 5 hairdressing statistics over 80 the different one 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.060
 above 85 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.600
 kia unique german goalkeeper model 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.760
 balanced statistics just like boredom 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.250
 and in any case this video there will not be the itext the videos of the parades because I am 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.430
 as I said in the last video the bot auction that I can't 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.430
 try to get me to the goal and block because I don't know how the opponents 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.300
 I don't know if you go to par raw no 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.010
 therefore only for this reason there will be no videos 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.510
 let's immediately see that we air with your heart 87 while we do not 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.040
 it is not too bad since it is the n1 82 vergacion 90 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.039
 the boring eur 85 of troubles with trumpets excellent 82 of wood 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.049
 referral n82 vino ayer against the 81 tell him 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:17.200
 but with tv and let it die of boredom and compare it to an alien is a bit difficult 

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:22.209
 I open the wall of prodigate to find a player who looks like ayer like 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:27.520
 goalkeeper fifa 2007 updates when buffon was 93 seems to me 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.230
 and since yesterday evening he has been playing because he is a monster job as a goalkeeper 

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:36.650
 reflexes are 86 victory over 3d range - so again 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.039
 sabaudia - limassol always more or less such a postponement 

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:44.109
 the speed who cares 58 noale. 46 of rhine 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:48.809
 while the placement files are saved against 83 of leno and I believe that 

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:51.489
 nokia placements is the + thing 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.390
 you are very hot now that you are seeing the glitter 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.800
 then counterweights of the two sides of the are of wood for each of the three cards 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.960
 me and my final grade I gave to the player 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.170
 as I had already said the videos alone of this will find themselves a little bit - 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.790
 then on 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.460
 2 3 minutes to get the two out in a week and more in this one 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.100
 video I do not know much what to say, however, since there have been so many comments 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.590
 they asked to do nokia I did because it seemed right to do it 

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:23.559
 nice to trust that it was really a mess to find the right player 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:25.800
 but he did it by now 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.390
 I still remember you suggesting me past 2 comments given a player by 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.859
 but make the next video 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:35.619
 and this time I will try to do a little longer though I look like I am sending 

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:40.249
 on the 3 4 minutes but anyway secretly liked you put me like subscribers to my 

00:03:40.249 --> 00:03:44.209
 channel and comment from home run stretched off bye all
