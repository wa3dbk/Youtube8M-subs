00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.580
 whatsup youtube my name is mÃ¼ller and 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.469
 Today there is a comment about 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.230
 advanced server I want to talk about it 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.809
 Talk about these cool tricks such as 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.789
 the atomic bomb the news or the moab 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.010
 or from black ops 2 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.590
 the nuclear medal what am I on there 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.750
 best find something in call of duty about 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.070
 144 should re- enter what is there 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.720
 I want to see that I'm interested 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.609
 quite a few of you have a few 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.380
 get comments in the direction and 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.180
 I thought that was a cool topic 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.430
 if I have the pros and cons 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.690
 of all the things to discuss and then 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.489
 we can of course in the comments 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.140
 discuss further talk about it 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.000
 but now comes my opinion so 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.230
 I think I have the moab great 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.960
 I found the guys super 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.399
 found and also the nuclear part at 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.899
 I find the news after the news 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.090
 live oneself it does that have 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.379
 i always found it quite uncool and 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.760
 I have the time very late 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.449
 Actually ignited only when I'm on it 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.570
 have gone 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.370
 in the fashion to that one if one the 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.899
 managed had to be able to use it 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.180
 you kill the whole enemy team 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.280
 then got more points so for 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.689
 every cellar after the morale as well 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.430
 then came back all the opponents of the 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.369
 spontaneously could push again 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.780
 So I found the moab really great 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.490
 It was just a bit stupid that one 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.439
 could not make direct or an 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.689
 that means when I actually do 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.610
 I have always played myself directly 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.799
 after the moab killed me myself 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.930
 a double triple or quad moab 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.170
 create can try in any case 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.700
 So if a place comes back 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.909
 really cool if you are right 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.380
 one after another as on a 25 first 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.759
 if you still have a 25 the trick 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.140
 if you are still on vacation 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.630
 directly receive I would really cool 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.500
 find the nuclear weapon was yes then 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.890
 even harder 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.229
 Since you have 30 kills without 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.579
 to die only with the weapon and was there 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.470
 the thing stops then you have nothing 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.780
 get out of a medal 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.250
 the cool was lasting you have the then 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.439
 you can count that means you have 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.240
 can always see how many users will be 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:01.100
 So how many medals did he have? 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.240
 with the pug was never any 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.250
 recorded that means many thought there 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.990
 yes, I certainly already had over 100 pugs 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.179
 in the end they had 3 or 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.039
 something was just flown and after all 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.720
 I have to admit it myself in Japan 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.010
 somehow forgot to count 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.080
 and since it has more to me no fun 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.270
 made because I certainly too 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.430
 50 60 did not want to exaggerate now 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.930
 but I think so and at the 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.870
 guys was like that either i did not like that 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.820
 played a lot but the guys could 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.100
 yes yes with the killstreaks so de nuke 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.170
 yes, a killstreak was the moab and the 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.480
 nuclear medal were not a kids style 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.100
 were always there the medal you can 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.500
 Of course, always get him and him on the 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.000
 you could always get whatever 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.860
 because you had it with you now 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.270
 The attack package had support package 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.620
 no matter 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.360
 at the new class so that was one 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.490
 Kirschweg you had to equip 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.690
 but then very strong because that 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.400
 game has ended 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.170
 I do not think so either 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.600
 well there are some fighting the whole thing 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.370
 play and you play super objective and 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.720
 Do you go to the flags and recover? 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.940
 then always gets away then somehow 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.970
 that makes the harrier bubble with the 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.860
 his concerts and with that he gets 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.450
 then the hatch and and win the game 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.550
 because he has been fighting all the time 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.350
 Although not often happened mostly 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.570
 the people it's got the jux got 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.610
 but here and there it's always been 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.320
 happened and I really did not like that 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.030
 So I think if something like that again 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.550
 it should be installed in any case 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.480
 be skill based and without without 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.190
 statements are 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.110
 that does not mean like the news and then 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.320
 first as well as the moab I would as well 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.150
 find cool if sven s if you already 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.340
 For example, a bomb will get like a bomb 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.190
 the mrb the moab and not just one 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.930
 medal but it should also be recorded 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.980
 if not I will do that so 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.690
 I stroked really more in the 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.760
 make a list of lines and then really 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.230
 Every month you get a line 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.290
 because I really want to know how 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.790
 many then had in the end and yes up 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.989
 In any case, this is super cool because 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.790
 it also for youtube 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:54.360
 there you can do cool series either 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.250
 soro thomas leif comments or 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.290
 just a series where you are with everyone 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.360
 Make a weapon or an ewf 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.830
 I think mega cool the idea and 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.150
 i definitely want that somehow 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.519
 something is installed 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.799
 I took that in cottbus 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.610
 I was definitely missing 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.049
 curious; excited 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.549
 maybe it's something again 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:13.230
 the affirmative hides the ghost 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.890
 So many people thought that too 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.590
 that's hidden because the month in 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.000
 MW 3 here was then very close to it 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.010
 announced and had we take 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.170
 but noticed for example in black ops 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.790
 2 knew the nuclear medal of the 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.920
 nobody what and how come then 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.400
 there are quite a lot of people there 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.570
 pleased 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.790
 then a little hype arose 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.650
 In any case I found super super cool 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.090
 but now I want your opinion in 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.070
 the comments higher water goes to 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.320
 A moab wanted to see the topic 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.990
 a lynx in a nuclear or metals 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.610
 something similar or did not want from 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.350
 to see or somehow has its own 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.240
 idea would interest me a lot 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.680
 he says to the subject, write it down 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.450
 any case us in the comments 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.770

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.300
