better I think that it gives him a

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.929 
better I think that it gives him a
reason<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.689> get<00:01:21.930> over<00:01:22.259> feeling<00:01:22.560> lousy<00:01:23.009> when

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
reason to get over feeling lousy when

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.359

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
literally in that way and and it gives

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.319

hockey<00:05:00.820> that<00:05:01.660> North<00:05:01.930> America<00:05:02.320> has<00:05:02.500> to<00:05:02.650> offer

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:02.949 
hockey that North America has to offer

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:05.939 
hockey that North America has to offer
my<00:05:03.789> one<00:05:04.000> big<00:05:04.360> main<00:05:04.600> goal<00:05:04.870> is<00:05:05.110> obviously<00:05:05.650> when

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:05.949 
my one big main goal is obviously when

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:08.460 
my one big main goal is obviously when
the<00:05:06.940> North<00:05:07.120> America<00:05:07.600> championship<00:05:08.229> with

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
the North America championship with

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.189 
the North America championship with
Mustangs<00:05:08.979> I<00:05:09.460> think<00:05:10.300> that's<00:05:10.479> my<00:05:10.630> biggest<00:05:10.660> goal

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:11.199 
Mustangs I think that's my biggest goal

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:14.430 
Mustangs I think that's my biggest goal
if<00:05:11.440> I<00:05:11.560> had<00:05:11.740> to<00:05:11.949> give<00:05:12.400> one<00:05:12.610> goal<00:05:12.880> I<00:05:13.180> think<00:05:14.050> that

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
if I had to give one goal I think that

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.260 
if I had to give one goal I think that
would<00:05:14.620> really<00:05:14.830> solidify<00:05:15.520> our<00:05:15.550> league<00:05:16.000> and

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
would really solidify our league and

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.589 
would really solidify our league and
make<00:05:17.229> us<00:05:17.440> elite<00:05:18.039> if<00:05:18.760> we<00:05:18.880> can<00:05:19.060> come<00:05:19.240> back<00:05:19.389> and

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:19.599 
make us elite if we can come back and

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:21.180 
make us elite if we can come back and
say<00:05:19.750> that<00:05:19.930> we're<00:05:20.050> the<00:05:20.139> best<00:05:20.289> in<00:05:20.500> North<00:05:20.710> America

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
say that we're the best in North America

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.029 
say that we're the best in North America
I<00:05:21.510> think<00:05:22.510> that<00:05:22.660> would<00:05:22.780> do<00:05:22.870> a<00:05:22.900> lot<00:05:23.169> for<00:05:23.380> us<00:05:23.620> back

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 
I think that would do a lot for us back

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:25.650 
I think that would do a lot for us back
home<00:05:24.280> and<00:05:24.460> Detroit<00:05:24.789> to<00:05:24.970> be<00:05:25.090> able<00:05:25.150> to<00:05:25.300> say<00:05:25.449> that

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
home and Detroit to be able to say that

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.730 
home and Detroit to be able to say that
with<00:05:25.750> us<00:05:26.020> I<00:05:26.410> would<00:05:27.370> say<00:05:27.760> the<00:05:28.090> WCHL<00:05:28.990> has<00:05:29.229> changed

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
with us I would say the WCHL has changed

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.560 
with us I would say the WCHL has changed
my<00:05:29.919> life<00:05:30.220> by<00:05:32.760> it's<00:05:33.760> just<00:05:34.030> enriched<00:05:34.330> it

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570
