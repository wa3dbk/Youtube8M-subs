00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.360

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.310
 I'm going to show you how to unlock 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.000
 and find all the collectibles of the 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.830
 base map of the mountain and I can tell you 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.110
 that are very simple also without cuts 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.090
 let's get them all as you see 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.220
 we started here in the camp one is 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.440
 that we arrived at the camp 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.710
 The first thing we are going to do is going to be 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.480
 go down 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.480
 to get the first collectibles 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.260
 is here today 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:00.969
 September 6, 1982 I have stayed 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.969
 only the others have died 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:10.380
 this is the first document to follow 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.380
 we turn back again 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.700
 here as a baby shining on the floor 

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:21.700
 until the first treasure 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.369
 all right 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.290
 now we keep going back 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.100
 in this table you find the second 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.479
 document 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.479
 dispatch report 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:49.020
 here on the ground find the second 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.020
 treasure 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.020
 and now as you see there on the right we 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.240
 this document is missing at the end 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.240
 from the map or we return the whole map back 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.170
 here we go down the stairs 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.270
 as you see here is the third and last 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.140
 document for good or for bad now yes 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.140
 the same with themes 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.580
 that as I said was here at the end 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.650
 of the map if we continue from here from 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.450
 access to the base we enter then the order 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.700
 it would be more or less inverse the first 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.080
 document the first collectable would be 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.819
 the document and as you see here at the end 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.680
 are the others fix a bit here in 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.330
 this map and so you can get them 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.060
 easy good I hope you liked it 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.349
