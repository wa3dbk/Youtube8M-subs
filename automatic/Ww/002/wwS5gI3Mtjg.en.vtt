now you want to be careful of the kind
of<00:01:37.380> cinnamon<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.860> choose<00:01:38.189> because<00:01:38.460> the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
of cinnamon that you choose because the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.999 
of cinnamon that you choose because the

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
to some people so what I would do is I

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.109 
to some people so what I would do is I

would go for Ceylon cinnamon or cinnamon

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.940 
would go for Ceylon cinnamon or cinnamon
verum<00:01:48.509> which<00:01:48.689> is<00:01:48.840> like<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.140> true<00:01:49.470> cinnamon

called gastric emptying which is the

your small intestine you can easily do
this<00:02:27.610> if<00:02:27.910> you're<00:02:28.120> eating<00:02:28.330> lots<00:02:28.630> of<00:02:28.750> pasta<00:02:29.140> you

this if you're eating lots of pasta you

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.050 
this if you're eating lots of pasta you
want<00:02:29.470> to<00:02:29.560> put<00:02:29.710> olive<00:02:29.980> oil<00:02:30.070> on<00:02:30.310> and<00:02:30.880> this<00:02:31.000> is

want to put olive oil on and this is
also<00:02:31.450> a<00:02:31.480> reason<00:02:31.690> why

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
also a reason why

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.650 
also a reason why
skim<00:02:33.280> milk<00:02:33.310> might<00:02:33.820> not<00:02:34.000> be<00:02:34.150> as<00:02:34.240> good<00:02:34.390> for<00:02:34.630> you

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
skim milk might not be as good for you

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.600 
skim milk might not be as good for you
as<00:02:34.750> whole<00:02:35.050> milk<00:02:35.290> because<00:02:35.800> even<00:02:36.370> though<00:02:36.460> whole

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
as whole milk because even though whole

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.460 
as whole milk because even though whole
milk<00:02:36.820> has<00:02:36.970> more<00:02:37.000> fat<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.930> resulting<00:02:38.320> blood

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
milk has more fat the resulting blood

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.260 
milk has more fat the resulting blood
sugar<00:02:38.680> from<00:02:38.800> drinking<00:02:39.100> skim<00:02:39.370> milk<00:02:39.550> is<00:02:39.730> far

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
sugar from drinking skim milk is far

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.510 
sugar from drinking skim milk is far
greater<00:02:40.510> than<00:02:41.160> consuming<00:02:42.160> whole<00:02:42.340> milk

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
greater than consuming whole milk

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.220 
greater than consuming whole milk
because<00:02:42.790> whole<00:02:43.000> milk<00:02:43.210> has<00:02:43.390> fat<00:02:43.870> and<00:02:44.110> it's

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
because whole milk has fat and it's

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.890 
because whole milk has fat and it's
blond<00:02:44.680> that<00:02:44.920> sort<00:02:45.190> of<00:02:45.250> glycemic<00:02:45.880> effect<00:02:46.240> so

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
blond that sort of glycemic effect so

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.570 
blond that sort of glycemic effect so
adding<00:02:47.200> fat<00:02:47.350> to<00:02:47.410> anything<00:02:47.890> slows<00:02:48.190> down<00:02:48.430> the

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
adding fat to anything slows down the

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.370 
adding fat to anything slows down the
absorption<00:02:48.640> and<00:02:49.180> there<00:02:49.720> are<00:02:49.810> a<00:02:49.840> whole<00:02:49.990> host<00:02:50.020> of

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
absorption and there are a whole host of

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.350 
absorption and there are a whole host of
really<00:02:50.500> healthy<00:02:50.740> fats<00:02:51.100> that<00:02:51.400> are<00:02:52.090> actually

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
really healthy fats that are actually

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.150 
really healthy fats that are actually
good<00:02:52.510> for<00:02:52.750> you<00:02:52.870> so<00:02:53.080> I<00:02:53.110> see<00:02:53.380> this<00:02:53.500> as<00:02:53.710> being<00:02:53.890> sort

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160
