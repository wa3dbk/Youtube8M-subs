00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.160
 markus the third guest is there to an end 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.420
 Congratulations to the championship 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.369
 Congratulations on the climb 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.079
 usually such games are not suitable 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.970
 for having one after that again 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:31.410
 talk about it but today was one 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.379
 impressive demonstration 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.780
 yes that was something special the team 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.760
 has given gas from the beginning and the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.660
 Defense Giants and already styled as 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.129
 teenager freikam 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.470
 I have already said it is 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.809
 Today outstanding and therefore also 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.040
 good game that's why we have our fans 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.739
 again given gas 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.049
 the gates played well the time said 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.729
 support was outstanding on values 

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:56.489
 plays that was just consistently one 

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:58.229
 party if you look back for 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.879
 you get the sticking points in the department 

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:01.769
 often talked about the hsv game 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.479
 no idea that I do not give a shit right now 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.339
 I'm not interested anymore 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:06.960
 Who we are, that's what you get 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.060
 seen today we want to celebrate and the 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.950
 Rest will tell us three more 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.960
 the players who replaced today 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.500
 yes that has nothing to do with it 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.380
 had 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.520
 or may just the visa special 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.950
 Player is pretty much everyone here 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.150
 important we just wanted one 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.320
 dignified farewell here are from 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.580
 to say goodbye to the fans 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.030
 otherwise everyone has the same 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.800
 proportion are ever different with that 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.160
 just behind us happens behind you 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.810
 more precisely , there are words for it 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.690
 now no words that was from the beginning 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.360
 and indescribable 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.390
 how they cheered us on 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.320
 that really felt on the field and 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.900
 I played that way today 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.510
 they cried yes believe but from the word go 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.520
 joined in geese from bright to before 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.230
 come a year that can 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.120
 Surprised journalists explained it is 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.620
 a step forward but more times 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.480
 back in the third league in retrospect 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.190
 Did you do everything right ? 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.660
 yes I have I got me in front of season 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.030
 Sometimes you have to take a step 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.200
 turn back to move forward 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.600
 and I have the better ones here 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.399
 perspectives and I have myself 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.220
 Well developed with the trainers 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.840
 with the team and how 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.310
 you have finally seen that 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.860
 Now worth what the team does 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.300
 from the beginning 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.410
 has held together even if she 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.880
 even if it's the first seven eight 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.920
 We did not run so well for weeks 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.020
 always knew sometime with ancestors 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.270
 go and then we will also be in progress 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.310
 and that's how it always happens 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.290
 kept together from the beginning to none 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.030
 finished the other one or something 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.150
 In the end, you can see what if they are 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.739
 more have matured well 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.120
 together 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:46.109
 and that's why they have become champions too
