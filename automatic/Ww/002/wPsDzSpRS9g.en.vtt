Newcastle<00:01:06.750> after<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.020> match<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.470> think

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
Newcastle after the match I think

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.859 
Newcastle after the match I think
Newcastle<00:01:08.400> have<00:01:08.970> left<00:01:09.210> themselves<00:01:09.360> with<00:01:09.689> them

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
a bridge too far in this match I think

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.580 
a bridge too far in this match I think
they<00:01:12.689> are<00:01:12.810> i've<00:01:12.869> got<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.080> possibility<00:01:13.560> of

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
they are i've got the possibility of

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.160 
they are i've got the possibility of
beating<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.189> Benfica<00:01:14.729> at<00:01:14.880> home<00:01:15.119> especially<00:01:15.780> at

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
beating a Benfica at home especially at

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.990 
beating a Benfica at home especially at
home<00:01:16.350> but<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:16.950> don't<00:01:17.369> think<00:01:17.610> they're<00:01:17.820> going<00:01:17.939> to

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
home but I don't think they're going to

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.210 
home but I don't think they're going to
overturn<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.509> 31<00:01:18.960> aggregate<00:01:19.409> score<00:01:19.740> you

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
one situation and I don't think they're

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.749 
one situation and I don't think they're
going<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.930> get<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.140> three<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.590> need<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.549> end

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
going to get the three that need to end

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.490 
going to get the three that need to end
even<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.360> two<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.659> they<00:01:33.780> need<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.170> make<00:01:34.439> a

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
even the two that they need to make a

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.170 
even the two that they need to make a
passband<00:01:34.920> figure<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.460> think<00:01:35.820> this<00:01:35.939> game<00:01:36.119> is

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
passband figure I think this game is

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.020 
passband figure I think this game is
going<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.720> probably<00:01:37.140> end<00:01:37.530> up<00:01:37.680> drawn<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.220> so

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
going to probably end up drawn and so

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.609 
going to probably end up drawn and so
