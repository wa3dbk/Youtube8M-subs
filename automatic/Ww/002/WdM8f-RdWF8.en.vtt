00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.050
 they left 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.120
 and 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.439
 how about friends my name is arise and 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.590
 welcome to a new video to a 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:23.509
 new ministry of gta 5 surely if 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.119
 you have been playing for a while or if you have 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:29.060
 seen videos of gta there will already be 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.640
 least heard of this secret and good 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.000
 it's about the ghost in the mountains the 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.100
 ghost of jong lindgren bill evans 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.930
 next you will be watching right now 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.210
 its screens a note that is what 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.760
 we found on the youtube page 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.820
 leonora johnson dotcom and good in this 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.989
 page there is a footnote also that 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.970
 it has nothing to do with leonora 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.239
 johnson but that tells us about this 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:56.050
 secret in which I say that he what 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:59.239
 pushed even though the wife wanted 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.699
 end the career he had then 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.940
 many things are said is between the 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:07.280
 he pushed he did not push him he fell down total that 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.130
 so far the theories say that 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.080
 effectively I pushed his wife there 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.300
 all in road and evans and what we will see today 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.130
 it's impressive because it's not about 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.890
 to see the ghost that we already know in 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.360
 where is it where is it but from 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.360
 listen to that ghost 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.050
 quickly right now then I want 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.090
 show them my location see how I 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.880
 I find just below the 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.890
 mountain where murder occurs and 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.950
 also notice how rightly opposite 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.500
 you will find the lighthouse and the house of Úrsula 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.360
 where, by the way, something very 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.460
 scary not exactly there but there's 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.370
 another mountain very close to here in the 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.590
 which is believed that Ursula killed his mother 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.750
 or the gardener who worked at home 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.730
 well that's another topic does not have to do 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.410
 with the secret but nothing more for 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.720
 that they notice the environment where we 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.120
 we found and now yes to be able 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.590
 listen to those phantasmagorical voices what 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.810
 what we have to do is the following 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.570
 we have to be right here in the 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.890
 camp and the voices we will listen to them 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.540
 only between 11 and 12 at night 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.580
 something that is very important is that it 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.680
 put your hearing aids not only for 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.600
 this video but also when you 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.430
 are playing try to be with 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.410
 hearing aids and not only with the volume 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.450
 of your television this is so that 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.430
 listen 100% since it's something 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.590
 complicated with the sound of the sea ​​with the 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.990
 sound also of the animals of the 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.690
 night etc 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.400
 when 11 11 with 5 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.950
 approximately will be when we listen 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.050
 the first ghost I would like the 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.060
 comments tell me what it is that 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.890
 you perceive that he says because I 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.110
 more that the volume goes up no more I could not 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.090
 understand and followed by this we will listen 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.880
 the second ghost that is a woman 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.590
 this is clearly heard simply 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.450
 is falling and it is heard as here and its 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.970
 screaming is very scary you get the 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.980
 skin chinita so friends now if not 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.070
 I'm going to shut up and listen with a lot 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.070
 Attention 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.690
 wow well a secret that we gave for 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.760
 finished apparently has much more 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.560
 history because after this that 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.290
 we just found it seems to me that 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.090
 there's more to figure out and before I leave 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.459
 I would like to share a theory that I have 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.290
 which is the next one you see that they are two 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.420
 ghosts two voices nothing 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.340
 the first is from a man the second 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.220
 it's about the voice of jolie and pnv the view 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.680
 when it is falling but for me that the 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.470
 first voice that we hear is the last 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.080
 phrase or the last word that I that you 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.419
 says to his wife before throwing the 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.090
 the mountain tell me what they think of this 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:30.070
 I think it makes a lot of sense 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.710
 finally I would like to show you something 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.800
 which I find very curious and the detail 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.540
 the last detail that led me to say 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.070
 I'm definitely witnessing something 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.620
 that has to do with murder in 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.060
 the mountains when you come here 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.850
 friends to listen to the two 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.770
 ghosts turn up and go to 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:51.460
 see that something curious is going to appear 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:53.440
 there from 11 to 12 at night also that 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.300
 what I am marking is nothing more and nothing 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.819
 less than me lin wang 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:01.360
 his ghost the secret that all 

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:03.460
 We knew exactly when twelve o'clock 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.490
 on the dot the ghost is going to disappear 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.680
 that little white dot seems to me that it is not 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.870
 a coincidence and now yes friends do not 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.940
 it remains more than saying goodbye, I hope that 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.430
 I liked the video and you can support me 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.319
 with a little hand up also this 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.270
 share what with your friends tell me what 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:21.069
 they think their theories I do not know what I 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.840
 want to say and also in the 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:25.030
 description is to leave the channel of a 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.580

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.770
 discovered the first one who heard the 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:38.349
