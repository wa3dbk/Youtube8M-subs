00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
better these like I say are workhorses

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.320 
better these like I say are workhorses
so<00:01:49.860> no<00:01:50.280> that's<00:01:50.430> not<00:01:50.610> even<00:01:50.640> doing<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.120> I've

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
so no that's not even doing that I've

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.700 
so no that's not even doing that I've
been<00:01:51.450> slowly<00:01:51.600> phasing<00:01:51.960> out<00:01:52.140> guns<00:01:52.380> it's<00:01:52.590> gone

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
been slowly phasing out guns it's gone

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.930 
been slowly phasing out guns it's gone
were<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.980> only<00:01:53.130> guns<00:01:53.430> I<00:01:53.610> stood<00:01:53.790> on<00:01:53.850> my

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
were the only guns I stood on my

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.300 
were the only guns I stood on my
rotation<00:01:54.420> it's<00:01:54.570> all<00:01:54.690> steel<00:01:54.960> this<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.740> my<00:01:55.890> happy

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
rotation it's all steel this is my happy

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.460 
rotation it's all steel this is my happy
238<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.060> use<00:01:57.240> as<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.420> deed<00:01:57.750> concealment<00:01:58.350> gun

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
238 that I use as a deed concealment gun

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.320 
238 that I use as a deed concealment gun
when<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.620> can't<00:01:58.890> carry<00:01:59.130> anything<00:01:59.340> else<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.909> I'm

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
when I can't carry anything else and I'm

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.910 
when I can't carry anything else and I'm
working<00:02:00.570> on<00:02:00.810> getting<00:02:00.870> a<00:02:01.140> shield<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.680> hoping

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
working on getting a shield and hoping

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.700 
working on getting a shield and hoping
that<00:02:02.250> will<00:02:02.430> replace<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:03.150> gun<00:02:03.420> for<00:02:03.630> that

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
that will replace that gun for that

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.020 
that will replace that gun for that
purpose<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:04.890> if<00:02:05.220> not<00:02:05.400> maybe<00:02:05.640> I'll<00:02:05.790> even<00:02:05.880> get

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
purpose and if not maybe I'll even get

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.680 
purpose and if not maybe I'll even get
something<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.420> little<00:02:06.600> smaller<00:02:06.750> but<00:02:08.479> right<00:02:09.479> now

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
something a little smaller but right now

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.489 
something a little smaller but right now
that's<00:02:10.379> joint<00:02:10.769> gun<00:02:10.890> left<00:02:11.159> I<00:02:11.400> carried<00:02:12.389> my<00:02:12.540> Glock

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:13.499 
that's joint gun left I carried my Glock

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:14.670 
that's joint gun left I carried my Glock
26<00:02:14.069> when<00:02:14.310> I'm<00:02:14.430> where

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
26 when I'm where

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.589 
26 when I'm where
undershirt<00:02:15.129> right<00:02:15.400> here<00:02:15.670> when<00:02:16.420> I'm<00:02:16.480> not

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
undershirt right here when I'm not

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:17.699 
undershirt right here when I'm not
wearing<00:02:16.840> an<00:02:16.930> undershirt<00:02:17.140> or<00:02:17.409> whereby<00:02:17.680> I

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
wearing an undershirt or whereby I

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.209 
wearing an undershirt or whereby I
planted<00:02:18.280> by<00:02:18.430> MMP<00:02:19.379> with<00:02:20.379> by<00:02:20.650> mates<00:02:21.040> for<00:02:21.159> a

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:21.219 
planted by MMP with by mates for a

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:23.250 
planted by MMP with by mates for a
tactical<00:02:21.430> holster<00:02:22.060> these<00:02:22.750> both<00:02:22.930> have<00:02:23.109> the

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
tactical holster these both have the

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.679 
tactical holster these both have the
same<00:02:23.370> manual<00:02:24.370> alarm<00:02:24.670> so<00:02:24.969> they're<00:02:25.090> both<00:02:25.450> nice

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:25.689 
same manual alarm so they're both nice

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:27.360 
same manual alarm so they're both nice
to<00:02:25.750> twist<00:02:26.200> back<00:02:26.319> and<00:02:26.530> forth<00:02:26.739> from<00:02:26.920> and<00:02:27.280> it's

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
to twist back and forth from and it's

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.559 
to twist back and forth from and it's
not<00:02:27.400> a<00:02:27.519> real<00:02:27.579> big<00:02:27.879> difference<00:02:28.030> I<00:02:28.209> shoot<00:02:28.390> them

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
not a real big difference I shoot them

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.690 
not a real big difference I shoot them
both<00:02:28.719> the<00:02:28.959> same<00:02:29.200> so<00:02:29.859> they're<00:02:30.040> both<00:02:30.189> easy<00:02:30.459> to

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
both the same so they're both easy to

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.459 
both the same so they're both easy to
the<00:02:30.790> interchange<00:02:30.969> so<00:02:31.810> these<00:02:31.989> are<00:02:32.139> about<00:02:32.290> two

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:32.469 
the interchange so these are about two

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:34.229 
the interchange so these are about two
main<00:02:32.680> carry<00:02:32.950> guns<00:02:33.189> right<00:02:33.400> now<00:02:33.430> and<00:02:34.000> when<00:02:34.180> you

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
main carry guns right now and when you

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:35.699 
main carry guns right now and when you
look<00:02:34.389> at<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.569> other<00:02:34.810> guns<00:02:35.109> in<00:02:35.319> my<00:02:35.349> rotation

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
look at the other guns in my rotation

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.110 
look at the other guns in my rotation
that<00:02:36.010> are<00:02:36.129> actually<00:02:36.430> serving<00:02:36.819> a<00:02:36.879> purpose

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
that are actually serving a purpose

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.690 
that are actually serving a purpose
they're<00:02:37.569> polymer<00:02:38.079> guns<00:02:38.290> to<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:39.340> gun<00:02:39.519> in<00:02:39.670> my

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
they're polymer guns to the gun in my

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.920 
they're polymer guns to the gun in my
safe<00:02:40.569> by<00:02:40.780> my<00:02:40.959> nightstand<00:02:41.500> is<00:02:41.769> my<00:02:41.889> px4<00:02:42.310> storm

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
safe by my nightstand is my px4 storm

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.210 
safe by my nightstand is my px4 storm
the<00:02:43.930> gun<00:02:44.139> in<00:02:44.409> my<00:02:45.420> bug-out<00:02:46.420> bag<00:02:46.659> it<00:02:46.959> is<00:02:46.989> a

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
the gun in my bug-out bag it is a

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.740 
the gun in my bug-out bag it is a
polymer<00:02:48.220> gun<00:02:48.430> it's<00:02:48.730> so<00:02:48.909> now<00:02:49.120> I'm<00:02:49.359> putting<00:02:49.629> the

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
polymer gun it's so now I'm putting the

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.349 
polymer gun it's so now I'm putting the
Glock<00:02:49.989> 23<00:02:50.319> in<00:02:50.680> there<00:02:50.829> now<00:02:50.980> I<00:02:51.310> figured<00:02:51.879> what

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:52.359 
Glock 23 in there now I figured what

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:53.640 
Glock 23 in there now I figured what
better<00:02:52.389> place<00:02:52.689> where<00:02:52.989> it<00:02:53.049> locked<00:02:53.260> it<00:02:53.439> in<00:02:53.560> a

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
better place where it locked it in a

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.509 
better place where it locked it in a
bug-out<00:02:53.950> bag<00:02:55.079> in<00:02:56.079> my<00:02:56.470> backup<00:02:56.980> safe<00:02:57.189> in<00:02:57.400> the

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
bug-out bag in my backup safe in the

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.819 
bug-out bag in my backup safe in the
house<00:02:57.760> used<00:02:58.540> to<00:02:58.629> be<00:02:58.689> a<00:02:58.840> stainless<00:02:59.169> car<00:02:59.590> in

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.500 
house used to be a stainless car in
there<00:03:00.010> now<00:03:00.730> it<00:03:01.269> is<00:03:01.629> a<00:03:01.930> CP<00:03:02.680> 250<00:03:03.310> so<00:03:03.879> it's<00:03:04.329> just

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
there now it is a CP 250 so it's just

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.300 
there now it is a CP 250 so it's just
