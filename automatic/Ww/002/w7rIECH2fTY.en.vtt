00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
if it was to come down to a purse bid he

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.590 
if it was to come down to a purse bid he
would<00:00:55.770> spend<00:00:56.129> an<00:00:56.399> outrageous<00:00:57.149> amount<00:00:57.329> of

would spend an outrageous amount of
money<00:00:57.739> to<00:00:58.739> win<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.250> purse<00:00:59.460> bid<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.180> then

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
money to win the purse bid and then

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.569 
money to win the purse bid and then

Sergei Korolev II Kathy Duva main event

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.910 
Sergei Korolev II Kathy Duva main event
would<00:01:02.969> have<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.300> have<00:01:03.539> Sergey<00:01:04.080> Kovalev<00:01:04.260> versus

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
would have to have Sergey Kovalev versus

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.969 
would have to have Sergey Kovalev versus
Adonis<00:01:05.309> Stevenson<00:01:05.820> likely<00:01:06.510> on<00:01:06.689> pbc<00:01:07.380> so

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
Adonis Stevenson likely on pbc so

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.450 
Adonis Stevenson likely on pbc so
because<00:01:08.430> Sergey<00:01:09.210> Kovalev<00:01:09.420> has<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.650> contract

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
because Sergey Kovalev has a contract

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.800
