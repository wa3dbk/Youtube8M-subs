I believe that's the first time that I

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.320 
I believe that's the first time that I
saw<00:01:05.400> naruto<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.780> was<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.140> year<00:01:07.610> 2000<00:01:08.610> @<00:01:08.760> 6

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.399 
saw naruto and it was the year 2000 @ 6
or<00:01:11.000> 2007<00:01:12.000> not<00:01:12.150> really<00:01:12.450> sure<00:01:12.780> on<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.080> correct

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
or 2007 not really sure on the correct

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.340 
or 2007 not really sure on the correct
year<00:01:13.860> but<00:01:14.430> it's<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.090> long<00:01:15.270> time<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.720> follow<00:01:16.080> hours

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
from the very first chapter I believe he

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.100 
from the very first chapter I believe he
said<00:03:24.770> that<00:03:24.800> he<00:03:25.100> wants<00:03:25.370> to<00:03:25.400> be<00:03:25.700> a<00:03:25.730> Hokage<00:03:26.240> I<00:03:26.660> not

said that he wants to be a Hokage I not

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.890 
said that he wants to be a Hokage I not
really<00:03:27.320> sure<00:03:27.530> in<00:03:27.760> which<00:03:28.760> chapter<00:03:29.210> he<00:03:29.390> said<00:03:29.750> it

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
really sure in which chapter he said it

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.200 
really sure in which chapter he said it
the<00:03:30.140> first<00:03:30.170> time<00:03:30.560> but<00:03:31.040> it's<00:03:31.610> pretty<00:03:31.850> much<00:03:32.030> from

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210 
the first time but it's pretty much from

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.680 
the first time but it's pretty much from
the<00:03:32.270> very<00:03:32.510> beginning<00:03:33.700> so<00:03:34.700> the<00:03:34.970> first<00:03:35.210> version

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
the very beginning so the first version

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.140 
the very beginning so the first version
would<00:03:36.050> look<00:03:36.770> something<00:03:37.130> on<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:37.490> lines<00:03:37.700> of

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
would look something on the lines of

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.220 
would look something on the lines of
like<00:03:38.709> Naruto<00:03:39.709> looking<00:03:40.430> at<00:03:40.580> Kanaka<00:03:41.330> robles

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
like Naruto looking at Kanaka robles

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:48.690 
like Naruto looking at Kanaka robles
like<00:03:42.709> a<00:03:42.740> sunset<00:03:43.160> and<00:03:43.910> he<00:03:44.510> has<00:03:44.780> his<00:03:47.020> Hokage<00:03:48.020> hat

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
like a sunset and he has his Hokage hat

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.670 
like a sunset and he has his Hokage hat
and<00:03:49.700> the<00:03:50.000> kakaik<00:03:50.480> clothes<00:03:50.780> or<00:03:51.080> something<00:03:51.350> like

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
and the kakaik clothes or something like

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.520 
and the kakaik clothes or something like
that<00:03:51.740> he's<00:03:52.459> looking<00:03:52.820> at<00:03:53.000> the<00:03:53.120> village<00:03:53.570> he<00:03:54.380> is

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
that he's looking at the village he is

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.530 
that he's looking at the village he is
looking<00:03:54.890> at<00:03:55.070> the<00:03:55.190> people<00:03:55.400> that<00:03:55.850> he<00:03:56.090> needs<00:03:56.390> to

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
looking at the people that he needs to

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.600 
looking at the people that he needs to
protect<00:03:56.840> and<00:03:57.350> stuff<00:03:57.560> that<00:03:57.590> stuff<00:03:58.070> like<00:03:58.250> that<00:03:58.280> I

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
protect and stuff that stuff like that I

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.870 
protect and stuff that stuff like that I
believe<00:03:59.090> the<00:03:59.480> first<00:03:59.750> version<00:04:00.200> is<00:04:00.760> going<00:04:01.760> to

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
believe the first version is going to

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.600 
believe the first version is going to
look<00:04:02.030> something<00:04:02.060> like<00:04:02.810> that<00:04:03.380> now<00:04:04.010> the<00:04:04.070> second

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
look something like that now the second

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.710 
look something like that now the second
one<00:04:04.730> is<00:04:04.760> Naruto's<00:04:05.750> family<00:04:06.590> portrait<00:04:07.480> now<00:04:08.480> this

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
one you can obviously guess that it's

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.720 
one you can obviously guess that it's
going<00:04:12.230> to<00:04:12.320> be<00:04:12.440> like<00:04:12.709> a<00:04:12.770> time<00:04:13.100> skip<00:04:13.400> it's<00:04:13.610> going

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
going to be like a time skip it's going

going to be like a time skip it's going
to<00:04:13.820> be<00:04:13.910> a<00:04:13.940> time<00:04:14.240> skip<00:04:14.510> of<00:04:14.660> 12<00:04:15.260> or<00:04:15.530> more<00:04:15.650> years

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
to be a time skip of 12 or more years
