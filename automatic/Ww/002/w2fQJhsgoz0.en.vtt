00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.900
 current consumes too much there is a solution to a whole sme of the region 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.830
 of fontainebleau the develop a magic box that can reduce 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.740
 considerably fuel consumption this kit is spent at table at 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.500
 all petrol or diesel engines currently testing them on different 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.580
 vehicles 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.580
 the explanations of william ponty and daniel small niche 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:24.949
 a simple small box inside demineralized water 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.580
 installed on an engine and that can according to its designers decrease significantly 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.120
 fuel consumption 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.450
 in fact it's a generators 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.570
 one that is filled with water 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.280
 at the wheel we saw an electric current 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.280
 in order to separate oxygen and hydrogen molecules 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.890
 we will then be able to 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.800
 ferrasse only by the engine by natural depression 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.000
 that will allow us to reduce fuel consumption and 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.890
 co2 emissions 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.110
 the user only has to put back water every 1500 km 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.190
 this motorist is easily allowed to convince 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.160
 I can not tell you scruples about having a big 4 4 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.240
 eqtype ...% the so-called donations are also in the astana team 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:13.240
 neptune for the repeat - and 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.250
 no, that's it 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.250
 the chairman of the om but save money but on 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.390
 she is also worthy of a medal at the last contest 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.600
 lugs the system will save 15 to 35% on fuel 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.750
 against an installation cost of 950 euros per month 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.539
 at this road carrier 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:34.850
 we decided to test the product 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:35.929
 because 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:38.070
 nice 15% fuel knowing that the courses 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.250
 in fact go back to october in paris the boss of the factory is a 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.230
 saving 15% his brother up to face 37 60 euros off 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.520
 taxes and a fuel economy per month 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.030
 multiply by his truck that lightens up the fuel bill 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.329
 since the start of marketing this type hydrogen two months ago 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.240
 forty karachi is in France have been trained
