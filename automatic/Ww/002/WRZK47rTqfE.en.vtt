00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
higher level if you're in the hundreds

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.740 
higher level if you're in the hundreds
but<00:02:32.430> I<00:02:32.459> would<00:02:32.640> recommend<00:02:32.879> doing<00:02:33.060> anyway<00:02:33.569> just

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
but I would recommend doing anyway just

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.660 
but I would recommend doing anyway just
because<00:02:33.840> it<00:02:34.080> gets<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.260> kill<00:02:34.439> faster<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:35.069> you

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
because it gets to kill faster and you

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.940 
because it gets to kill faster and you
really<00:02:36.150> don't<00:02:36.360> need<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.540> super<00:02:36.930> defense<00:02:37.380> but<00:02:37.740> if

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
really don't need a super defense but if

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.220 
really don't need a super defense but if
you're<00:02:38.190> below<00:02:38.370> 90<00:02:38.880> I<00:02:38.910> would

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
you're below 90 I would

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.470 
you're below 90 I would
highly<00:02:39.379> recommend<00:02:39.860> it<00:02:39.980> I'm<00:02:40.519> bringing<00:02:40.909> it<00:02:41.209> just

highly recommend it I'm bringing it just

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.530 
highly recommend it I'm bringing it just
because<00:02:41.780> I'm<00:02:42.019> level<00:02:42.290> 92<00:02:42.560> and<00:02:43.069> it<00:02:43.970> helps<00:02:44.299> and

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
because I'm level 92 and it helps and

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.910 
because I'm level 92 and it helps and
it's<00:02:45.200> only<00:02:45.349> about<00:02:45.560> 200<00:02:46.340> GP<00:02:47.500> you're<00:02:48.500> also<00:02:48.650> going

failing<00:05:15.210> against<00:05:16.210> this<00:05:16.900> level<00:05:17.889> 92<00:05:18.639> I<00:05:18.789> think<00:05:19.090> it

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
failing against this level 92 I think it

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.390 
failing against this level 92 I think it
is<00:05:19.410> but<00:05:20.410> here<00:05:20.860> we<00:05:20.949> go<00:05:22.500> watch<00:05:23.500> this<00:05:23.680> I<00:05:23.889> almost

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
is but here we go watch this I almost

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.270 
is but here we go watch this I almost
died<00:05:24.940> too<00:05:25.000> which<00:05:25.720> I<00:05:25.930> was<00:05:26.139> like<00:05:26.349> crazy<00:05:26.949> because

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
died too which I was like crazy because

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.550 
died too which I was like crazy because
it's<00:05:27.490> never<00:05:27.760> happened<00:05:28.180> before<00:05:28.260> so<00:05:29.260> I<00:05:29.289> don't

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
it's never happened before so I don't

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
it's never happened before so I don't
know<00:05:29.740> how<00:05:30.190> he<00:05:31.150> was<00:05:31.720> able<00:05:31.750> to<00:05:32.020> do<00:05:32.260> this<00:05:32.440> but<00:05:33.400> he

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
know how he was able to do this but he

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.050 
know how he was able to do this but he
was<00:05:33.729> kicking<00:05:34.060> my<00:05:34.300> ass<00:05:35.340> but<00:05:36.340> I<00:05:36.370> get<00:05:36.729> a<00:05:36.760> decent

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
was kicking my ass but I get a decent

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.390 
was kicking my ass but I get a decent
loop<00:05:37.510> from<00:05:37.780> it<00:05:37.960> so<00:05:38.169> I<00:05:38.199> don't<00:05:38.380> even<00:05:38.770> it<00:05:39.160> doesn't

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
loop from it so I don't even it doesn't

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.650 
loop from it so I don't even it doesn't
even<00:05:39.490> matter<00:05:39.669> I<00:05:39.940> don't<00:05:40.150> even<00:05:40.240> think<00:05:40.419> of<00:05:40.539> my

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
even matter I don't even think of my

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.719 
even matter I don't even think of my
prayer<00:05:40.900> wasn't<00:05:41.229> on<00:05:41.320> I<00:05:41.639> wouldn't<00:05:42.639> have
