such<00:04:15.860> but<00:04:16.430> still<00:04:17.320> it's<00:04:18.320> pretty<00:04:19.239> quick<00:04:20.269> I

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
such but still it's pretty quick I

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.100 
such but still it's pretty quick I
couldn't<00:04:22.310> have<00:04:22.400> afforded<00:04:22.640> by<00:04:23.180> a<00:04:23.419> large<00:04:23.840> one

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
couldn't have afforded by a large one

fill<00:04:29.180> it<00:04:29.300> up<00:04:29.419> it<00:04:30.140> would<00:04:30.380> take<00:04:30.590> pretty<00:04:31.580> much

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
fill it up it would take pretty much

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.440
