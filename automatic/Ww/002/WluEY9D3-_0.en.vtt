00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.200
 can be video of gameplay versioning the 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.820
 challenger to no other because yesterday he 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.519
 the servers were left before they were 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.519
 failing being well raw 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:22.980
 and as a track in the street of San Juan 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.320
 well this is this one video is the top 5 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.640
 of broken mills to rise from no not me 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.260
 I 'll take a lot longer than three 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.439
 minutes here are below the 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.899
 I will leave the number 5 plus go down to 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.500
 draw is a champion that nobody nobody 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.270
 nobody knows how to play you anymore you have to 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.700
 play it a little good with him 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.950
 and you will be able to upload 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.379
 fast the line remembers that it goes up is very 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.899
 strong your last one is such stupidity 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.820
 with his last wreck of anyone and 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.160
 not everyone is playing against it like this 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.469
 that that's my number 5 champion for 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.360
 climb faster from it or in this from 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:02.890
 bronze silver and gold 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:04.960
 the champion number 4 that I have is velcros 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.210
 Velcro is a champion that neither in the and 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.260
 knows how to use them and how to play 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.940
 against him 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.820
 honestly I do not know either what I do not play 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.890
 but he is a very strong champion this 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.170
 I was asking was I was playing 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:21.010
 reading and velcros is a very very champion 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.870
 but very strong to climb the serious 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.460
 in the breasts I promise that they play 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.160
 velcros are going to go up a little bit more 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.660
 fast than normal but obviously 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.400
 you have to know how to play it you have to 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.560
 read it you have to know what your 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.479
 skills you have to know how to 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.070
 he does the combo and all that I leave to you 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.890
 you are the ones who are going to 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:43.750
 have to read a little bit more about 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:47.500
 the number three the number three is six six 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:50.890
 the crazy fireman good to go crazy good 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.229
 is that it is pumping firefighters makes 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.890
 firefighters chapter chapter psychoanalysis 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:59.020
 is 13 for his little mouth and his 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.640
 skills are too strong and use 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.470
 be encouraging a fucking little bomb like that 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.270
 from afar and well phu tho 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.610
 and every time they want to stay you put on 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.619
 pixie trampitas jump and then you have 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.410
 same goals of the pine pumps for all 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.220
 sides pumps everywhere and that's why 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.770
 I recommend six at position number 3 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:21.010
 to go up a little bit faster 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:23.350
 number number 2 vidal vidal is broken and 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.020
 gap web roti gap where you want it 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.570
 see low a lot this I think they're going to 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.850
 announce next Sunday he pulled out another 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.250
 video of how this will be rearranged 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.670
 weight of the positions and I will give another 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.280
 obviously another new one another top 5 again 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.200
 to meet as you go up probably 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.110
 between the rail zone week or the 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.870
 joke but we are with the alicante follows 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.750
 talking great and nibali is a champion 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.670
 that has a lot of mobility as 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.930
 you could see in the video me 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.050
 I'm going everywhere although you're going to play 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.930
 meanwhile you go to the yard all 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.300
 and its very strong because its cv is too 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.760
 strong too much damage you just have to have 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.620
 a little skill or know how to do 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.870
 know how to predict the movements of 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.870
 enemy to hit him and hit him and do 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.360
 an exaggerated but good I think I do not know 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:18.290
 when they take advantage of it while 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.530
 right now and the number one music of 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.530
 drums 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:29.989
 which is a super super super champion 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:32.000
 super strong with his cv and up goes up this 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.099
 stupid the uil that is that is broken 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.940
 and if more attack speed goes down too 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:40.790
 magical damage too much surte is a mom 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.770
 yes schultis is a fool god challenge 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.250
 loves him 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:49.160
 it makes you immortal no one hits you nobody 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.930
 Immuner touch speak and you can 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.300
 while you are invulnerable you can be 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.150
 attacking you can wear it as much as 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:59.510
 an ally or like you and that's why it's so 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:02.450
 Broken rises too low and if you put it 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.630
 spiritual attack works more your class 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.900
 slow you heal the double speed of 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:11.420
 or greater this movement already has everything 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:14.780
 what is necessary to carry a game all 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.040
 and that was the number one top it 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.620
 I recommend that the can upload a 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.320
 little faster than good guys is my 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.180
 top 5 of meet to climb faster than 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.950
 I hope you liked it, leave me 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.170
 here in the comments what is your top 5 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:31.080
 to climb faster or the toxic that you 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:34.560
 like for the top 5 that you do not like or the 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:38.040
 top 5 things to cook and have a 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.409
 basic cost of what you want not of 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:45.110
 the boys 7 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:45.110
 ha ha ha ha ha
