get the pin lock shield and what's even
more<00:00:40.710> awesome<00:00:41.010> than<00:00:41.339> that<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:41.999> that<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.629> came

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
of bugs me so what I do like about the

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.510 
of bugs me so what I do like about the
SVD<00:01:26.640> obviously<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.590> the<00:01:28.590> SV<00:01:28.920> which<00:01:29.160> is<00:01:29.310> the

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
SVD obviously is the SV which is the

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.180 
SVD obviously is the SV which is the
drop-down<00:01:29.910> survivor<00:01:30.530> which<00:01:31.530> this<00:01:31.980> particular

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
drop-down survivor which this particular

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.560 
drop-down survivor which this particular
one<00:01:32.610> came<00:01:33.210> with<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.600> dark<00:01:33.840> tip<00:01:35.090> so<00:01:36.090> works

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
one came with the dark tip so works

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.240 
one came with the dark tip so works
super<00:01:36.930> well<00:01:36.960> for<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.520> purpose<00:01:38.930> and<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:40.620> didn't

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
super well for that purpose and I didn't

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.130 
super well for that purpose and I didn't
find<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.550> unlock<00:01:42.030> system<00:01:42.210> on<00:01:42.510> the<00:01:42.600> u.s.<00:01:42.900> spec

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
find that unlock system on the u.s. spec

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.520 
find that unlock system on the u.s. spec
one<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:43.770> that's<00:01:43.950> really<00:01:44.610> cool<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:45.210> find<00:01:45.480> that

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.700 

another<00:01:49.130> thing<00:01:49.460> that<00:01:49.990> I'm<00:01:50.990> not<00:01:51.200> a<00:01:51.230> big<00:01:51.440> fan<00:01:51.650> of

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
another thing that I'm not a big fan of

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.630 
another thing that I'm not a big fan of
so<00:01:52.100> this<00:01:52.250> is<00:01:52.310> not<00:01:52.460> something<00:01:53.420> that<00:01:53.690> I<00:01:53.930> like<00:01:54.650> him

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
so this is not something that I like him

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.330 
so this is not something that I like him
all<00:01:56.150> that<00:01:56.510> much<00:01:56.720> but<00:01:57.050> it<00:01:57.350> does<00:01:57.560> a<00:01:57.590> good<00:01:57.770> job<00:01:57.830> and

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
all that much but it does a good job and

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.420 
all that much but it does a good job and
it<00:01:58.640> doesn't<00:01:58.940> bother<00:01:59.000> me<00:01:59.210> that<00:01:59.360> much<00:01:59.920> is<00:02:00.920> the

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
it doesn't bother me that much is the

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.320 
it doesn't bother me that much is the
helmet<00:02:02.270> strap<00:02:02.540> on<00:02:02.810> this<00:02:03.410> euro-spec<00:02:04.100> one<00:02:04.460> is<00:02:04.730> a

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
helmet strap on this euro-spec one is a

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.900 
helmet strap on this euro-spec one is a
ratcheting<00:02:06.170> system<00:02:06.320> so<00:02:06.710> it's<00:02:06.860> got<00:02:07.040> a<00:02:07.310> quick

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
ratcheting system so it's got a quick

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.410 
ratcheting system so it's got a quick
release<00:02:07.940> latch<00:02:08.660> and<00:02:09.020> this<00:02:10.000> plastic<00:02:11.000> piece<00:02:11.150> set

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
release latch and this plastic piece set

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.750 
release latch and this plastic piece set
when<00:02:11.690> you<00:02:11.780> put<00:02:12.260> them<00:02:12.350> together<00:02:12.500> like<00:02:12.980> clip

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
when you put them together like clip

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.400 
when you put them together like clip
click<00:02:14.180> together<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:14.840> then<00:02:14.960> when<00:02:15.110> you<00:02:15.200> want<00:02:15.320> to

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
click together and then when you want to

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.110 
click together and then when you want to
release<00:02:15.590> you<00:02:15.800> pull<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.160> tab<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:16.670> then<00:02:16.790> this

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
release you pull the tab and then this

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.260 
release you pull the tab and then this
just<00:02:17.890> slides<00:02:18.890> out<00:02:19.959> so<00:02:20.959> I<00:02:20.990> prefer<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:22.270> the

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
just slides out so I prefer the the

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.850 
just slides out so I prefer the the
traditional<00:02:23.680> d-rings

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
traditional d-rings

inch<00:03:12.680> to<00:03:13.340> an<00:03:13.489> inch<00:03:13.670> something<00:03:14.000> like<00:03:14.239> that<00:03:14.739> so<00:03:15.739> I

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
inch to an inch something like that so I

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.920 
inch to an inch something like that so I
thought<00:03:16.730> that<00:03:16.880> looked<00:03:17.090> really<00:03:17.239> cool<00:03:17.510> it<00:03:17.810> makes

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
thought that looked really cool it makes

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.570 
thought that looked really cool it makes
it<00:03:18.110> look<00:03:18.230> a<00:03:18.320> lot<00:03:18.440> like<00:03:18.650> the<00:03:18.860> more<00:03:19.040> premium<00:03:19.250> in

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
it look a lot like the more premium in

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.120 
it look a lot like the more premium in
GP<00:03:19.910> helmets<00:03:20.420> like<00:03:20.480> the<00:03:20.690> k5<00:03:21.049> and<00:03:21.440> the<00:03:21.560> Corsa

GP helmets like the k5 and the Corsa

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.130 
GP helmets like the k5 and the Corsa
which<00:03:22.400> I<00:03:22.730> realized<00:03:23.360> has<00:03:23.540> a<00:03:23.570> completely

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
which I realized has a completely

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.860 
which I realized has a completely
different<00:03:24.290> diffuser<00:03:24.950> but<00:03:25.280> in<00:03:26.269> general<00:03:26.690> it

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
different diffuser but in general it

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.080 
different diffuser but in general it
adds<00:03:27.410> to<00:03:28.989> in<00:03:29.989> my<00:03:30.110> opinion<00:03:30.500> the<00:03:30.880> quality<00:03:31.880> the

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
adds to in my opinion the quality the

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.539 
adds to in my opinion the quality the
look<00:03:32.299> and<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:32.540> quality<00:03:32.989> of<00:03:33.019> the<00:03:33.200> helmet<00:03:33.530> so<00:03:33.709> I

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
look and the quality of the helmet so I

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.180

as this is very region specific so I'm

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.310

by chance and well I'll be happy but not

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.180 
by chance and well I'll be happy but not

is<00:04:38.280> really<00:04:38.850> life<00:04:39.120> but<00:04:39.720> a<00:04:39.750> big<00:04:40.050> part<00:04:40.200> of<00:04:40.320> it<00:04:40.470> is

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
is really life but a big part of it is

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.129 
is really life but a big part of it is
that<00:04:40.800> it<00:04:40.979> has<00:04:41.100> a<00:04:41.130> plastic<00:04:41.700> resin<00:04:41.850> based<00:04:42.330> shell

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
that it has a plastic resin based shell

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.710 
that it has a plastic resin based shell
so<00:04:43.950> something<00:04:44.490> I<00:04:44.580> noticed<00:04:44.820> which<00:04:45.180> is<00:04:45.330> not<00:04:45.510> very

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
so something I noticed which is not very

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.050 
so something I noticed which is not very
scientific<00:04:45.900> but<00:04:46.620> when<00:04:47.370> when<00:04:47.520> you<00:04:47.610> pick<00:04:47.790> it<00:04:47.820> up

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
scientific but when when you pick it up

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.400 
scientific but when when you pick it up
it<00:04:48.900> doesn't<00:04:49.110> seem<00:04:49.590> to<00:04:49.710> have<00:04:49.830> a<00:04:49.860> large<00:04:50.280> into<00:04:50.790> it

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
it doesn't seem to have a large into it

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.950 
it doesn't seem to have a large into it
there's<00:04:52.410> a<00:04:52.500> lot<00:04:52.680> of<00:04:52.770> flex<00:04:53.720> whereas<00:04:54.720> when<00:04:54.900> you

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
there's a lot of flex whereas when you

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.800 
there's a lot of flex whereas when you
pick<00:04:55.110> this<00:04:55.260> up<00:04:55.500> it<00:04:55.830> is<00:04:56.310> a<00:04:56.340> bit<00:04:56.580> heavier<00:04:56.970> but<00:04:57.720> it

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
pick this up it is a bit heavier but it

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.740 
pick this up it is a bit heavier but it
certainly<00:04:58.020> I<00:04:58.470> wouldn't<00:04:59.100> consider<00:04:59.220> heavy<00:05:00.150> it's

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
certainly I wouldn't consider heavy it's

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.219 
certainly I wouldn't consider heavy it's
actually<00:05:01.110> quite<00:05:01.350> light<00:05:01.590> weight<00:05:02.190> still<00:05:03.229> your

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
actually quite light weight still your

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:06.680 
actually quite light weight still your
instant<00:05:04.590> what<00:05:04.710> you<00:05:04.770> can<00:05:04.950> tell<00:05:05.210> he's<00:05:06.210> got<00:05:06.419> some

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
instant what you can tell he's got some

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.950 
instant what you can tell he's got some
serious<00:05:07.820> rigidity<00:05:08.820> to<00:05:09.000> it<00:05:09.030> and<00:05:09.300> strength<00:05:09.630> so

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
serious rigidity to it and strength so

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.080 
serious rigidity to it and strength so
yeah<00:05:12.960> so<00:05:13.289> I<00:05:13.320> think<00:05:13.460> it's<00:05:14.460> a<00:05:14.550> preference<00:05:14.910> thing

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
yeah so I think it's a preference thing

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.370 
yeah so I think it's a preference thing
I<00:05:15.330> would<00:05:15.479> feel<00:05:15.630> more<00:05:15.750> comfortable<00:05:15.810> wearing

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
I would feel more comfortable wearing

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.409 
I would feel more comfortable wearing
this<00:05:16.530> on<00:05:16.710> track<00:05:16.979> but<00:05:17.520> I<00:05:17.550> knew<00:05:17.789> I<00:05:17.820> wasn't<00:05:18.150> going

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
this on track but I knew I wasn't going

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:20.000
