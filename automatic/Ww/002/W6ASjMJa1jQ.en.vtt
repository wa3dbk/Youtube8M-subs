00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
to be so then pointer the middle then

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.460 
to be so then pointer the middle then
switch<00:04:55.910> to<00:04:56.120> your<00:04:56.270> pointer<00:04:56.720> because<00:04:57.290> you<00:04:57.380> me

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
switch to your pointer because you me

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.730 
switch to your pointer because you me
doing<00:04:57.650> this<00:04:57.740> twice<00:04:58.070> then<00:04:58.960> middle<00:04:59.960> and<00:05:00.170> then

switch<00:05:00.920> the<00:05:00.950> pointer<00:05:01.400> and<00:05:01.520> then<00:05:02.000> it<00:05:02.390> doesn't

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
switch the pointer and then it doesn't

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.570 
switch the pointer and then it doesn't
really<00:05:02.690> matter<00:05:02.900> which<00:05:03.290> one<00:05:03.350> you<00:05:03.620> hit<00:05:03.800> this

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
really matter which one you hit this

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.150 
really matter which one you hit this
note<00:05:04.910> with<00:05:05.290> just<00:05:06.290> as<00:05:06.410> long<00:05:06.590> as<00:05:06.770> it's<00:05:06.950> either

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
note with just as long as it's either

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.600 
note with just as long as it's either
your<00:05:07.610> index<00:05:08.510> or<00:05:08.780> your<00:05:08.960> middle<00:05:09.980> I<00:05:10.130> prefer

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
your index or your middle I prefer

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.680 
your index or your middle I prefer
middle<00:05:10.910> and<00:05:11.530> then<00:05:12.530> pointer<00:05:13.430> and<00:05:13.670> then<00:05:14.090> thumb

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
middle and then pointer and then thumb

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.350 
middle and then pointer and then thumb
and<00:05:14.990> then<00:05:15.350> middle<00:05:16.070> and<00:05:16.310> then<00:05:16.490> thumb<00:05:16.940> and<00:05:17.240> then

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
and then middle and then thumb and then

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.140 
and then middle and then thumb and then
pointer<00:05:17.990> and<00:05:18.230> then<00:05:18.580> pointer<00:05:19.580> again<00:05:19.850> then

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
pointer and then pointer again then

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:26.680 
pointer and then pointer again then
middle<00:05:20.750> then<00:05:21.230> switch<00:05:21.740> and<00:05:22.070> then

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:33.290 

middle<00:05:29.030> middle<00:05:30.080> thumb<00:05:31.080> or<00:05:31.669> really<00:05:32.669> anything

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
middle middle thumb or really anything

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.480 
middle middle thumb or really anything
I<00:05:33.889> mean<00:05:34.889> the<00:05:34.979> thumb<00:05:35.160> is<00:05:35.280> much<00:05:35.430> easier<00:05:36.530> and<00:05:37.530> then

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
I mean the thumb is much easier and then

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:39.800 
I mean the thumb is much easier and then
you<00:05:38.610> basically<00:05:38.880> do<00:05:39.030> that<00:05:39.150> again<00:05:39.389> except<00:05:39.690> you

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
you basically do that again except you

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:51.710 
you basically do that again except you
skip<00:05:40.139> the--<00:05:43.160> you<00:05:44.160> just<00:05:44.520> go<00:05:49.490> and<00:05:50.490> then<00:05:51.479> this<00:05:51.600> is

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
skip the-- you just go and then this is

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.689 
skip the-- you just go and then this is
when<00:05:51.840> the<00:05:51.900> base<00:05:52.139> your<00:05:52.830> left<00:05:53.070> hand<00:05:53.280> comes<00:05:53.550> in

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:53.699 
when the base your left hand comes in

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:55.670 
when the base your left hand comes in
I'll<00:05:53.910> do<00:05:54.479> that<00:05:54.600> all<00:05:54.660> the<00:05:54.960> right<00:05:55.139> hands<00:05:55.470> then

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
I'll do that all the right hands then

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:01.040 
I'll do that all the right hands then
I'll<00:05:55.800> do<00:05:55.919> all<00:05:55.979> the<00:05:56.130> left<00:05:56.460> hands<00:05:59.630> the<00:06:00.630> next<00:06:00.870> part

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
I'll do all the left hands the next part

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.360 
I'll do all the left hands the next part
is<00:06:01.080> basically<00:06:01.380> the<00:06:01.680> same<00:06:01.800> as<00:06:01.949> the<00:06:02.039> last<00:06:02.190> time

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
is basically the same as the last time

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:28.550 
is basically the same as the last time
except<00:06:02.940> it<00:06:03.060> goes<00:06:13.370> and<00:06:14.370> then<00:06:25.550> and<00:06:26.550> then<00:06:27.410> you<00:06:28.410> do

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 
except it goes and then and then you do

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.250 
except it goes and then and then you do
that<00:06:28.590> part<00:06:29.159> again
