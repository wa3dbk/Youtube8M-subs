opposed<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.410> kids<00:02:19.680> who<00:02:20.010> weren't<00:02:20.340> given

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
opposed to the kids who weren't given

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.839 
opposed to the kids who weren't given
the<00:02:21.000> water<00:02:21.920> basically<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.129> kids<00:02:23.370> that<00:02:23.640> were

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
the water basically the kids that were

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.320 
the water basically the kids that were
given<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.330> water<00:02:24.590> there<00:02:25.590> they<00:02:25.980> burn<00:02:26.250> far<00:02:27.060> more

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
given the water there they burn far more

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.809 
given the water there they burn far more
calories<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:28.140> so<00:02:28.470> it<00:02:28.590> says<00:02:28.860> just<00:02:29.430> by<00:02:29.580> drinking

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
calories and so it says just by drinking

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.180 
calories and so it says just by drinking
water<00:02:30.030> your<00:02:30.540> body<00:02:30.569> increases<00:02:31.530> its<00:02:31.709> burning<00:02:32.099> of

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
water your body increases its burning of

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.880 
water your body increases its burning of
calories<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:33.360> scientists<00:02:33.930> estimated<00:02:34.380> that

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
calories the scientists estimated that

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.509 
calories the scientists estimated that
if<00:02:35.069> you<00:02:35.340> do<00:02:35.580> if<00:02:36.180> you<00:02:36.390> do<00:02:36.599> this<00:02:37.010> you'll<00:02:38.010> burn<00:02:38.310> off

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
if you do if you do this you'll burn off

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.660 
if you do if you do this you'll burn off
an<00:02:38.760> extra<00:02:39.060> three<00:02:39.420> pounds<00:02:40.110> over<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.590> year<00:02:40.830> now

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
an extra three pounds over the year now

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.449 
an extra three pounds over the year now
that<00:02:42.209> might<00:02:42.360> not<00:02:42.390> sound<00:02:42.750> like<00:02:42.959> a<00:02:43.290> lot<00:02:43.590> but<00:02:43.920> if

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
that might not sound like a lot but if

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.910 
that might not sound like a lot but if
you're<00:02:44.610> trying<00:02:44.910> to<00:02:44.940> lose<00:02:45.120> weight<00:02:45.920> every

you're trying to lose weight every

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.339 
you're trying to lose weight every
single<00:02:47.280> pound<00:02:47.459> counts<00:02:47.849> even<00:02:48.660> if<00:02:48.959> it's<00:02:49.110> three

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
single pound counts even if it's three

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.949 
single pound counts even if it's three
pounds<00:02:49.799> over<00:02:50.579> you<00:02:51.180> know<00:02:51.299> the<00:02:51.480> course<00:02:51.690> of<00:02:51.870> the

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
pounds over you know the course of the

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.550 
pounds over you know the course of the
year<00:02:52.290> also<00:02:53.329> another<00:02:54.329> thing<00:02:54.630> that<00:02:54.690> was<00:02:55.290> talked

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
year also another thing that was talked

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.330 
year also another thing that was talked
about<00:02:55.680> was<00:02:55.860> how<00:02:56.549> a<00:02:57.110> lot<00:02:58.110> of<00:02:58.140> people<00:02:58.340> because

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
about was how a lot of people because

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.229 
about was how a lot of people because
they're<00:02:59.579> drinking<00:02:59.849> all<00:03:00.299> these<00:03:01.220> different

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
they're drinking all these different

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.699 
they're drinking all these different
high-calorie<00:03:03.239> drinks<00:03:03.690> and<00:03:04.110> not<00:03:04.230> enough<00:03:04.530> water

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
high-calorie drinks and not enough water

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.800 
high-calorie drinks and not enough water
are<00:03:05.010> dehydrated<00:03:05.790> and<00:03:05.940> that's<00:03:06.239> actually

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
are dehydrated and that's actually

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.420 
are dehydrated and that's actually
counterproductive<00:03:07.049> to<00:03:08.040> your<00:03:08.190> weight<00:03:08.400> loss

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
counterproductive to your weight loss

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.600 
counterproductive to your weight loss
goals<00:03:08.940> because<00:03:09.900> if<00:03:10.170> you're<00:03:10.440> dehydrated<00:03:10.650> then

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
goals because if you're dehydrated then

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.970 
goals because if you're dehydrated then
you<00:03:12.030> know<00:03:12.150> it<00:03:12.299> says<00:03:12.599> that<00:03:12.840> your<00:03:12.989> kidneys<00:03:13.590> are

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
you know it says that your kidneys are

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.710 
you know it says that your kidneys are
swamped<00:03:14.760> with<00:03:15.030> salts<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:17.299> are<00:03:18.299> swamped<00:03:18.630> with

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
swamped with salts and are swamped with

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.539 
swamped with salts and are swamped with
salt<00:03:19.049> and<00:03:19.260> without<00:03:19.560> adequate<00:03:19.920> liquids<00:03:20.459> you

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
salt and without adequate liquids you

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.879 
salt and without adequate liquids you
don't<00:03:20.910> get<00:03:21.120> enough<00:03:21.359> potassium<00:03:21.859> which<00:03:22.859> is

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889 
don't get enough potassium which is

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:26.539 
don't get enough potassium which is
essential<00:03:23.549> to<00:03:23.579> weight<00:03:23.880> loss<00:03:24.139> um<00:03:25.370> you<00:03:26.370> also

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
essential to weight loss um you also

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.390 
essential to weight loss um you also
don't<00:03:26.880> get<00:03:27.120> enough<00:03:27.359> of<00:03:27.540> minerals<00:03:28.500> that<00:03:29.280> are

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
don't get enough of minerals that are

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.990 
don't get enough of minerals that are
also<00:03:29.579> you<00:03:30.239> know<00:03:30.269> key<00:03:30.690> to<00:03:30.959> weight<00:03:31.079> loss<00:03:31.139> so

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
also you know key to weight loss so

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.120 
also you know key to weight loss so
basically<00:03:33.000> by<00:03:33.480> not<00:03:33.840> drinking<00:03:34.230> water<00:03:34.440> you're

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
basically by not drinking water you're

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.479 
basically by not drinking water you're
starving<00:03:35.819> your<00:03:36.000> body<00:03:36.239> because<00:03:37.049> your<00:03:37.920> kidneys

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
starving your body because your kidneys

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.580 
starving your body because your kidneys
become<00:03:38.790> strong<00:03:39.030> they<00:03:39.299> can't<00:03:39.540> filter<00:03:40.319> and

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
become strong they can't filter and

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.930 
become strong they can't filter and
absorb<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:41.549> things<00:03:41.819> that<00:03:42.120> they<00:03:42.810> need<00:03:43.049> to<00:03:43.319> and

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
absorb the things that they need to and

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.400 
absorb the things that they need to and
you<00:03:44.940> know<00:03:45.060> so<00:03:45.450> you're<00:03:45.720> trying<00:03:46.049> to<00:03:46.139> figure<00:03:46.260> out

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
you know so you're trying to figure out

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.990 
you know so you're trying to figure out
why<00:03:46.620> can't<00:03:46.889> I<00:03:46.980> lose<00:03:47.130> weight<00:03:47.310> why<00:03:47.519> can't<00:03:47.790> I<00:03:47.850> lose

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
why can't I lose weight why can't I lose

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.699 
why can't I lose weight why can't I lose
weight<00:03:48.239> well<00:03:48.630> because<00:03:49.109> you're<00:03:49.230> not<00:03:49.350> drinking

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
weight well because you're not drinking

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.410 
weight well because you're not drinking
enough<00:03:49.769> water<00:03:49.920> because<00:03:50.459> you're<00:03:51.150> probably

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
enough water because you're probably

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.910 
enough water because you're probably
dehydrated<00:03:51.889> so<00:03:53.540> my<00:03:54.540> challenge<00:03:54.959> to<00:03:55.319> you<00:03:55.590> guys
