00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
face if you want you would put the

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.740 
face if you want you would put the
bronzer<00:00:44.340> here<00:00:44.789> just<00:00:45.120> like<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.360> heart-shaped

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
bronzer here just like the heart-shaped

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.959 
bronzer here just like the heart-shaped
face<00:00:45.840> on<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.350> outer<00:00:46.530> portions<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.280> then<00:00:47.789> you

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
face on the outer portions and then you

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.510 
face on the outer portions and then you
would<00:00:48.090> apply<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.840> bronzer<00:00:49.050> here<00:00:49.680> as<00:00:49.890> well<00:00:50.129> on

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
would apply the bronzer here as well on

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.700 
would apply the bronzer here as well on
the<00:00:50.760> jawline<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.480> what<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.690> does<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.350> just

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
the jawline so what that does is it just

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.310 
the jawline so what that does is it just
brings<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.100> face<00:00:53.309> in<00:00:53.579> on<00:00:54.090> all<00:00:54.719> four<00:00:55.289> corners

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
brings the face in on all four corners

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.380 
brings the face in on all four corners
and<00:00:55.860> gives<00:00:56.070> more<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.370> rounder<00:00:56.730> effect<00:00:57.059> right

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
and gives more of a rounder effect right

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.779 
and gives more of a rounder effect right
so<00:00:57.899> if<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.170> drew<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:58.949> square<00:00:59.250> on<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.550> piece<00:00:59.760> of

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
so if you drew a square on a piece of

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.150 
so if you drew a square on a piece of
paper<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:01.020> shaded<00:01:01.350> in<00:01:01.590> those<00:01:01.829> four

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
paper and you shaded in those four

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.969 
paper and you shaded in those four
corners<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.940> would<00:01:03.210> just<00:01:03.239> appear<00:01:03.719> more<00:01:03.979> that

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
corners it would just appear more that

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.270 
corners it would just appear more that
makes<00:01:05.250> sense<00:01:05.780> now<00:01:06.780> like<00:01:07.290> I've<00:01:07.470> seen<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.100> where

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
makes sense now like I've seen it where

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.039 
makes sense now like I've seen it where
people<00:01:08.610> like<00:01:08.790> overdo<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.330> with<00:01:09.450> blush<00:01:09.840> and

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
people like overdo it with blush and
