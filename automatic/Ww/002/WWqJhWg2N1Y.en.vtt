starting in the second half of these

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.600 
starting in the second half of these
recent<00:03:08.840> games<00:03:08.989> and<00:03:09.290> we<00:03:09.950> just<00:03:10.130> wanted<00:03:10.340> to<00:03:10.459> come

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
start and I think we accomplished just

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.949 
start and I think we accomplished just
that<00:03:14.000> it's<00:03:14.510> something<00:03:14.810> we've<00:03:14.930> been

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
that it's something we've been

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.310 
that it's something we've been
practicing<00:03:15.590> where<00:03:15.830> we<00:03:15.950> go<00:03:16.310> hard<00:03:16.519> every<00:03:16.820> play<00:03:16.850> I

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
practicing where we go hard every play I

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.900 
practicing where we go hard every play I
personally<00:03:18.320> have<00:03:18.620> some<00:03:18.860> fun<00:03:19.040> with<00:03:19.190> that<00:03:19.220> but

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
personally have some fun with that but

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.990 
personally have some fun with that but
we<00:03:20.450> managed<00:03:21.049> to<00:03:21.260> play<00:03:22.130> hard<00:03:22.340> every<00:03:22.489> play<00:03:22.610> and

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
we managed to play hard every play and

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.150 
we managed to play hard every play and
then<00:03:23.120> we've<00:03:23.570> got<00:03:24.019> the<00:03:24.170> win<00:03:24.290> all<00:03:24.920> of<00:03:25.040> our

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
being two touchdowns up I thought today

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.140 
being two touchdowns up I thought today
was<00:04:00.680> gonna<00:04:00.800> be<00:04:01.010> important<00:04:01.400> for<00:04:01.519> us<00:04:01.580> to<00:04:01.849> be<00:04:02.000> able

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
was gonna be important for us to be able

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.460 
was gonna be important for us to be able
to<00:04:02.300> do<00:04:02.510> some<00:04:02.720> things<00:04:02.900> we<00:04:03.080> want<00:04:03.260> to<00:04:03.349> do

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
to do some things we want to do

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.440 
to do some things we want to do
defensively<00:04:03.830> and<00:04:04.400> that's<00:04:04.700> that<00:04:05.030> splits<00:04:05.360> a

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
defensively and that's that splits a

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.880 
defensively and that's that splits a
little<00:04:05.659> bit<00:04:05.810> and<00:04:06.019> get<00:04:06.200> after<00:04:06.349> them<00:04:06.620> and<00:04:06.769> that's

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
little bit and get after them and that's

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.680 
little bit and get after them and that's
what<00:04:07.040> we<00:04:07.129> were<00:04:07.250> able<00:04:07.370> to<00:04:07.489> do<00:04:07.700> you<00:04:08.330> know<00:04:08.420> if<00:04:08.510> they

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
what we were able to do you know if they

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.720

conservative<00:04:12.049> on<00:04:12.349> defense<00:04:12.769> but<00:04:12.950> we<00:04:13.099> were<00:04:13.220> able

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
conservative on defense but we were able

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.759 
conservative on defense but we were able
