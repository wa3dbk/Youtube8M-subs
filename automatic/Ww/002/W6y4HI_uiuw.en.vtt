00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
here it's a little small has a little

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.059 
here it's a little small has a little
curve<00:03:31.560> in<00:03:31.980> it<00:03:32.209> so<00:03:33.209> like<00:03:33.510> if<00:03:33.870> I<00:03:34.049> go<00:03:34.260> like<00:03:34.409> this

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
curve in it so like if I go like this

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.479 
curve in it so like if I go like this
let<00:03:35.549> me<00:03:35.669> get<00:03:35.819> my<00:03:35.849> finger<00:03:37.069> caught<00:03:38.069> in<00:03:38.280> there

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
because you can see that then has a

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.909 
because you can see that then has a
curve<00:03:41.910> in<00:03:42.150> it<00:03:42.269> and<00:03:42.480> then<00:03:43.260> that<00:03:43.500> will<00:03:43.680> catch<00:03:43.889> it

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:43.919 
curve in it and then that will catch it

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:52.369 
curve in it and then that will catch it
farther<00:03:44.669> in<00:03:44.910> like<00:03:46.340> like<00:03:47.340> that<00:03:47.810> so<00:03:51.379> anyway
