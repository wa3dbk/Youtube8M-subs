00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 what's up with friends stephanie a lot 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.640
 deeper and warmly welcome to one 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.250
 something different video 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.170
 today there are no copies no special 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.969
 I do not know whatever 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.620
 and yes we show you today 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.109
 or I show you today 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.940
 my teams are so many around the net 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.710
 To be precise are three teams too 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.210
 why the outstanding teams there 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.859
 soon simply the team that also 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.140
 this is inferior and the players all 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.460
 will be worth a lot less and 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.810
 That's why I do not feel like it now 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.980
 to make a loss but to 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.890
 Another reason for that is that me 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.180
 just not that much sugar and if 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.309
 I then mostly play thanks for that 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.930
 pag road to glory and here i have too 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.030
 still a really big amount of coins 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.469
 about 500,000 coins 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.879
 yes, I do not want to spend so much 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.530
 la bam many of you have asked me 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.090
 yes show me your teams I have 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.800
 also said yes so special are the 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.270
 not at all but yes many wanted it 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.340
 Just start watching here we catch 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.690
 with the portuguese league team that 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.309
 I think I was pretty much the first thing 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.960
 At that time, I got 4 10 ultimate 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.059
 team created you keep in goal 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.920
 Mangala and Maicon want to go next 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.820
 Defend especially long-lasting 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.719
 770 tembo 82 defensive and 87 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.700
 if you are not yet 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.159
 have tried then you have to to 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.380
 every time you play you have qaeda 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.970
 we here as left-back and danilo 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.100
 right-back now two now 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.869
 not so strong players but who do 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.180
 Actually your job then hammock 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.990
 central defensive also a very big one 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.950
 player 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.630
 you can see that we have done here 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.549
 left four stars scilla as well 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.619
 salvio right front then we have in 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.320
 central offensive midfield labiadh 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.470
 four-star schiller and you're gone 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.450
 from defends in order of 83 83 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.100
 Do you like the outstanding team like 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.750
 already said but can be 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.189
 actually quite good play eder and 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.509
 martin it two very sturdy and 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.790
 actually quite fast players 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.280
 front in there with both course, the 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.170
 four star skills that was here now 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.850
 time the portuguese league team now 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.189
 we come to a series a team that way 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.780
 we have a little swat above all 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.000
 here with ibahn was a really fast 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.770
 but we also have good strong ones 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.869
 players such as hamsik and 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.399
 Candreva who must bomb long shot 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.380
 I just say 3s 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.619
 home defense with cashier who 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.740
 and bonna she pretty fast the 23 in 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.210
 distributor here the 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.680
 Of course, and then Johann in the gate 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.300
 defensive with de jong and cambiasso now 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.400
 not the very good players there 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.680
 There are of course again and awning 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.500
 I do not know who but the tui her 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.850
 job this for me enough 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.220
 and I do not know maybe 200 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.780
 MÃ¼nster so tasted yes and left 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.460
 then asamoah also a towering 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.870
 unfortunately only three star skills 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.580
 but otherwise not even 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.030
 so bad should we come to 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.380
 a last team is a team and that 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.300
 is such a small mix as I have too 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.710
 no great hybrid like it off now 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.140
 and once presented the scott pictures 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.970
 here is my little skate team 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.290
 I think that's four five stars 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.030
 I'll have skinner with me then 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.550
 Bernese on the exchange bank as we 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.680
 in theory then have mangala and kabul 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.790
 in the interior defense cloud and 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.680
 clichÃ© very very fast 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.380
 fullback dani the first five 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.200
 stars skela with assaidi lamborghini and 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.870
 the right to have and ben arfa in the central 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.370
 midfield or central defensive otherwise 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.660
 not now logan good man but the 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.210
 is just because of the chemistry in the team 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.430
 so that everyone here on a 9 resp 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.100
 Tens chemistry comes then we have here 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.650
 front central offensive action and 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.360
 of course the legend ronaldinho with 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.340
 five star skills to get in front of it 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.720
 pato was unfortunately only four star skills 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.370
 back then I think five stars it 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.590
 applies and then I have but now and then 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.880
 was still done almost like this 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.070
 that one might even do that 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.470
 can not even play so bad makes 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.120
 in any case much fun so far as what 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.890
 that actually from the teams myself 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.790
 Hope you liked it some will 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.500
 maybe not like it yet 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.210
 say these are boring teams yes 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.530
 Of course these are not the best 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.420
 teams but as I said I had 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.910
 Of course now a lot of sale because of 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.380
 brand crash starts pretty soon and 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.480
 yes I just did not want that much - 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.250
 So far, I also had a lot to do 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.170
 better team of the bundesliga team at what 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.580
 whatever the saga is too much though 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.190
 not hated wants me there again 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.320

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.670
