00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.139 

we're<00:00:00.960> going<00:00:01.079> to<00:00:01.140> be<00:00:01.230> exploring<00:00:01.560> the<00:00:02.149> cranial

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
we're going to be exploring the cranial

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.900 
we're going to be exploring the cranial
vault<00:00:03.210> view<00:00:03.870> as<00:00:04.259> the<00:00:04.859> calvaria<00:00:05.430> of<00:00:05.549> the<00:00:05.670> skull

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
vault view as the calvaria of the skull

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.000 
vault view as the calvaria of the skull
has<00:00:06.060> been<00:00:06.089> removed<00:00:06.629> and<00:00:06.810> underneath<00:00:07.440> is<00:00:07.770> a

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
has been removed and underneath is a

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.270 
has been removed and underneath is a
large<00:00:08.790> amount<00:00:09.210> of<00:00:09.469> markings<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:10.679> spaces<00:00:11.250> and

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
large amount of markings and spaces and

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.459 
large amount of markings and spaces and
so<00:00:11.610> let's<00:00:11.820> begin<00:00:12.120> with<00:00:12.570> just<00:00:12.840> understanding

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
so let's begin with just understanding

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.980 
so let's begin with just understanding
our<00:00:13.679> orientation<00:00:14.490> so<00:00:14.759> our<00:00:15.000> orientation<00:00:15.420> so

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
our orientation so our orientation so

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.450 
our orientation so our orientation so
here's<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.379> anterior<00:00:16.830> side<00:00:17.070> here's<00:00:17.369> the

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
here's the anterior side here's the

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.040 
here's the anterior side here's the
posterior<00:00:17.730> side<00:00:18.000> of<00:00:18.060> course<00:00:18.750> now<00:00:18.900> we're

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
posterior side of course now we're

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.830 
posterior side of course now we're
looking<00:00:19.380> down<00:00:19.410> or<00:00:20.070> inferior<00:00:20.730> lis<00:00:20.939> on<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.689> this

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
looking down or inferior lis on to this

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.929 
looking down or inferior lis on to this
area<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.740> let's<00:00:22.949> begin<00:00:23.100> first<00:00:23.490> with<00:00:23.609> the

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
area and let's begin first with the

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.000 
area and let's begin first with the
imagine<00:00:24.779> yourself<00:00:25.109> as<00:00:25.260> shrinking<00:00:25.710> yourself

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
imagine yourself as shrinking yourself

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.820 
imagine yourself as shrinking yourself
down<00:00:26.189> into<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.580> small<00:00:27.510> person<00:00:27.990> so<00:00:28.470> let's<00:00:28.650> start

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
down into a small person so let's start

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.349 
down into a small person so let's start
in<00:00:28.949> what<00:00:29.189> we<00:00:29.250> call<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.580> anterior<00:00:30.119> cranial

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
in what we call the anterior cranial

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.240 
in what we call the anterior cranial
fossa<00:00:30.750> so<00:00:31.260> if<00:00:31.380> you're<00:00:31.529> walking<00:00:31.710> around<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
fossa so if you're walking around the

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.350 
fossa so if you're walking around the
first<00:00:32.520> thing<00:00:32.669> you'll<00:00:32.820> notice<00:00:33.090> is<00:00:33.210> you're

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
first thing you'll notice is you're

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.470 
first thing you'll notice is you're
walking<00:00:33.570> along<00:00:34.530> this<00:00:34.710> horizontal<00:00:35.010> plate<00:00:35.850> this

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
walking along this horizontal plate this

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.270 
walking along this horizontal plate this
is<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.660> horizontal<00:00:37.110> plate<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.800> frontal

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
is the horizontal plate of the frontal

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.670 
is the horizontal plate of the frontal
bone<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.640> then<00:00:39.329> you'll<00:00:39.600> find<00:00:39.899> that<00:00:40.020> locked<00:00:40.440> in

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
bone and then you'll find that locked in

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.619 
bone and then you'll find that locked in
here<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.280> like<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> big<00:00:41.790> chasm<00:00:42.059> if<00:00:42.329> this<00:00:42.480> was

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
here is like a big chasm if this was

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.060 
here is like a big chasm if this was
removed<00:00:42.989> this<00:00:43.170> would<00:00:43.320> be<00:00:43.379> an<00:00:43.469> individual<00:00:43.860> bone

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
removed this would be an individual bone

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.639 
removed this would be an individual bone
of<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.280> eath<00:00:44.430> mode<00:00:44.670> bone<00:00:44.879> or<00:00:45.030> at<00:00:45.149> my<00:00:45.360> bone<00:00:45.649> that

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
of the eath mode bone or at my bone that

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.410 
of the eath mode bone or at my bone that
you<00:00:46.739> would<00:00:46.920> have<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.219> jump<00:00:47.430> chasm<00:00:47.820> but<00:00:47.910> we

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
you would have to jump chasm but we

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.000 
you would have to jump chasm but we
don't<00:00:48.600> have<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.930> do<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.170> because<00:00:49.469> here<00:00:49.860> is

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
don't have to do that because here is

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.200 
don't have to do that because here is
something<00:00:50.370> what<00:00:50.579> we<00:00:50.670> call<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.940> cribriform

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
something what we call the cribriform

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.240 
something what we call the cribriform
plate<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:52.050> cribriform<00:00:52.320> plate<00:00:52.379> if<00:00:53.010> you

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
plate and this cribriform plate if you

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.880 
plate and this cribriform plate if you
can<00:00:53.370> see<00:00:53.610> closely<00:00:53.820> enough<00:00:54.600> has<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.170> bunch<00:00:55.739> of

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
can see closely enough has a bunch of

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.709 
can see closely enough has a bunch of
little<00:00:56.070> holes<00:00:56.190> in<00:00:56.699> them<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.239> all<00:00:57.600> these

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
little holes in them and all these

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.630 
little holes in them and all these
little<00:00:57.930> holes<00:00:58.170> are<00:00:58.530> called<00:00:59.309> cribriform<00:00:59.609> plate

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
little holes are called cribriform plate

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.580 
little holes are called cribriform plate
foramina<00:01:00.510> for<00:01:00.750> some<00:01:00.899> reason<00:01:01.199> i<00:01:01.260> always<00:01:01.289> think

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
foramina for some reason i always think

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.260 
foramina for some reason i always think
of<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.770> little<00:01:01.859> baby<00:01:02.100> just<00:01:02.399> kind<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.670> hanging

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
of a little baby just kind of hanging

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.530 
of a little baby just kind of hanging
out<00:01:03.329> here<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.930> cribriform<00:01:04.140> plate<00:01:04.280> the

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
out here in the cribriform plate the

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.969 
out here in the cribriform plate the
being<00:01:06.540> cooled<00:01:07.080> down<00:01:07.290> by<00:01:07.560> these<00:01:07.710> cribriform

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
being cooled down by these cribriform

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.250 
being cooled down by these cribriform
plate<00:01:08.010> foramina<00:01:08.790> this<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.060> for<00:01:09.330> your<00:01:09.930> sense<00:01:10.170> of

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
plate foramina this is for your sense of

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.520 
plate foramina this is for your sense of
smell<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.860> allows<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.580> smell<00:01:11.970> actually

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
smell and allows you to smell actually

smell and allows you to smell actually
and<00:01:13.530> right<00:01:13.740> in<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.920> middle<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.340> little

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
and right in the middle is this little

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.800 
and right in the middle is this little
kind<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:16.020> blade<00:01:16.790> structure<00:01:17.790> here<00:01:18.180> this<00:01:18.600> is

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
kind of blade structure here this is

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.539 
kind of blade structure here this is
called<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.170> crista<00:01:19.619> galli<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.250> crista

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
called the crista galli and the crista

do to be able to remember that but this

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.560 
do to be able to remember that but this
little<00:01:31.439> point<00:01:31.680> here<00:01:31.950> or<00:01:32.040> this<00:01:32.159> little<00:01:32.570> process

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
little point here or this little process

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.300 
little point here or this little process
is<00:01:33.780> called<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.049> crista<00:01:34.350> galli<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:35.009> far<00:01:35.159> we

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
is called the crista galli so so far we

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.530 
is called the crista galli so so far we
got<00:01:35.340> horizontal<00:01:35.909> plate<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.210> frontal<00:01:36.479> bone

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
got horizontal plate of the frontal bone

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.530 
scans and other things like that and
you'll<00:03:03.840> find<00:03:04.020> the<00:03:04.140> two<00:03:04.350> ends<00:03:04.830> here<00:03:05.330> that<00:03:06.330> kind

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
you'll find the two ends here that kind

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.720 
you'll find the two ends here that kind
of<00:03:06.630> peak<00:03:07.140> up<00:03:07.410> these<00:03:07.890> are<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.340> posterior

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
of peak up these are the posterior

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.220 
of peak up these are the posterior
klonoa<00:03:09.180> processes<00:03:09.660> so<00:03:09.780> if<00:03:09.870> these<00:03:09.990> are<00:03:10.050> the

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
klonoa processes so if these are the

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.450 
klonoa processes so if these are the
anterior<00:03:10.680> then<00:03:10.800> these<00:03:10.920> are<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.160> posterior

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
where you would actually sit this is

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.230 
where you would actually sit this is
what<00:03:14.910> we<00:03:15.000> call<00:03:15.210> the<00:03:15.890> hypophyseal<00:03:16.890> fossa<00:03:17.520> this

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
what we call the hypophyseal fossa this

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.430 
what we call the hypophyseal fossa this
is<00:03:18.330> where<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.510> pituitary<00:03:18.960> gland<00:03:19.170> is<00:03:19.230> going<00:03:19.290> to

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
is where the pituitary gland is going to

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.630 
is where the pituitary gland is going to
rest<00:03:19.680> all<00:03:20.280> right

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
rest all right

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.340 
rest all right
so<00:03:20.790> we<00:03:20.910> jump<00:03:21.120> down<00:03:21.270> here<00:03:21.540> and<00:03:21.690> also<00:03:21.900> now<00:03:22.200> we're

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
so we jump down here and also now we're

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.540 
so we jump down here and also now we're
in<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.500> middle<00:03:22.650> cranial<00:03:22.860> fossa<00:03:23.160> we're<00:03:23.430> going

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
in the middle cranial fossa we're going

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.070 
in the middle cranial fossa we're going
to<00:03:23.610> kind<00:03:23.820> of<00:03:23.850> roll<00:03:24.090> around<00:03:24.240> like<00:03:24.660> as<00:03:24.840> if<00:03:24.990> you

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
to kind of roll around like as if you

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.390 
to kind of roll around like as if you
jumped<00:03:25.380> in<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:25.590> you<00:03:25.650> tripped<00:03:25.920> and<00:03:26.040> you<00:03:26.130> flew

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
jumped in and you tripped and you flew

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.030 
jumped in and you tripped and you flew
around<00:03:26.520> like<00:03:26.880> whoa<00:03:27.290> well<00:03:28.290> that<00:03:28.410> gives<00:03:28.620> me<00:03:28.860> the

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
around like whoa well that gives me the

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.490 
around like whoa well that gives me the
acronym<00:03:29.460> rolls<00:03:29.850> are<00:03:30.180> o<00:03:30.210> LS<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:30.990> that<00:03:31.080> helps<00:03:31.380> me

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
acronym rolls are o LS and that helps me

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.170 
acronym rolls are o LS and that helps me
to<00:03:31.620> know<00:03:31.650> all<00:03:32.010> these<00:03:32.160> foramen<00:03:32.610> you<00:03:32.910> can<00:03:33.030> see

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
to know all these foramen you can see

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.530 
to know all these foramen you can see
these<00:03:33.360> frame<00:03:33.750> in<00:03:33.900> here<00:03:34.170> see<00:03:34.650> this<00:03:34.800> little<00:03:35.010> guy

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
these frame in here see this little guy

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.670 
these frame in here see this little guy
this<00:03:36.540> little<00:03:36.870> guy<00:03:36.990> here<00:03:37.230> this<00:03:37.350> is<00:03:37.470> what<00:03:37.620> we

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
this little guy here this is what we

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.310 
this little guy here this is what we
call<00:03:37.830> the<00:03:37.920> frame<00:03:38.160> and<00:03:38.370> rotunda<00:03:38.970> round<00:03:39.630> rotunda

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
call the frame and rotunda round rotunda

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.050 
call the frame and rotunda round rotunda
and<00:03:40.500> then<00:03:40.620> we<00:03:40.710> go<00:03:40.830> to<00:03:40.860> the<00:03:41.040> frame<00:03:41.250> in<00:03:41.370> oval<00:03:41.760> and

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
and then we go to the frame in oval and

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.150 
and then we go to the frame in oval and
then<00:03:42.810> through<00:03:43.110> here<00:03:43.470> this<00:03:43.590> is<00:03:43.740> the<00:03:43.860> foramen

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
then through here this is the foramen

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.820 
then through here this is the foramen
lacerum<00:03:44.540> lacerum<00:03:45.540> as<00:03:45.660> in<00:03:45.840> laceration<00:03:46.590> looks

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
lacerum lacerum as in laceration looks

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.380 
lacerum lacerum as in laceration looks
like<00:03:46.950> a<00:03:46.980> big<00:03:47.190> tear<00:03:47.550> as<00:03:47.730> you<00:03:47.820> can<00:03:47.970> see<00:03:48.090> kind<00:03:48.360> of

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
like a big tear as you can see kind of

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.210 
like a big tear as you can see kind of
like<00:03:48.540> a<00:03:48.570> tear<00:03:48.990> and<00:03:49.230> that's<00:03:49.710> why<00:03:49.800> they<00:03:49.950> call<00:03:50.100> it

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
like a tear and that's why they call it

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.110 
like a tear and that's why they call it
the<00:03:50.310> foramen<00:03:50.580> lacerum

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
the foramen lacerum

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.120 
the foramen lacerum
jumping<00:03:52.020> in<00:03:52.170> there<00:03:52.290> would<00:03:52.440> be<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:52.680> carotid

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
jumping in there would be the carotid

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.920 
jumping in there would be the carotid
canal<00:03:53.160> and<00:03:53.640> joins<00:03:53.910> with<00:03:54.180> that<00:03:54.360> and<00:03:54.600> then<00:03:54.900> the

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
canal and joins with that and then the

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.750 
canal and joins with that and then the
smallest<00:03:55.380> one<00:03:55.680> here<00:03:55.920> this<00:03:56.160> little<00:03:56.460> tiny<00:03:56.580> guy

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
smallest one here this little tiny guy

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.390 
smallest one here this little tiny guy
is<00:03:56.820> the<00:03:57.200> spinoza<00:03:58.200> foramen<00:03:58.590> spinosum<00:03:58.740> so<00:03:59.310> we

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
is the spinoza foramen spinosum so we

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.720 
is the spinoza foramen spinosum so we
got<00:03:59.550> they<00:03:59.730> are<00:04:00.740> OLS<00:04:01.740> so<00:04:02.100> it<00:04:02.160> kind<00:04:02.310> of<00:04:02.370> makes<00:04:02.520> our

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
got they are OLS so it kind of makes our

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.660 
got they are OLS so it kind of makes our
Oh<00:04:03.090> LSS<00:04:04.020> is<00:04:04.350> the<00:04:04.470> smallest<00:04:04.770> one<00:04:04.920> and<00:04:05.280> so<00:04:05.580> we

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
Oh LSS is the smallest one and so we

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.880 
Oh LSS is the smallest one and so we
kind<00:04:05.820> of<00:04:05.850> rules<00:04:06.150> around<00:04:06.570> our<00:04:07.020> OLS<00:04:07.530> gives<00:04:07.770> me

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
kind of rules around our OLS gives me

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.860 
kind of rules around our OLS gives me
the<00:04:07.980> acronym<00:04:08.340> for<00:04:08.460> all<00:04:08.610> these<00:04:08.820> things<00:04:09.060> so

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
the acronym for all these things so

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.480 
the acronym for all these things so
that's<00:04:10.020> what<00:04:10.200> we<00:04:10.290> have<00:04:10.440> in<00:04:10.470> this<00:04:10.770> area<00:04:10.950> the

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
that's what we have in this area the

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.940 
that's what we have in this area the
middle<00:04:11.810> middle<00:04:12.810> cranial<00:04:13.170> fossa<00:04:13.440> if<00:04:13.740> you<00:04:13.860> were

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
middle middle cranial fossa if you were

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.729 
middle middle cranial fossa if you were
to<00:04:14.070> just<00:04:14.490> kind<00:04:14.760> of<00:04:14.820> climb<00:04:15.210> up<00:04:15.570> you'll<00:04:16.500> find

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
to just kind of climb up you'll find

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.470 
to just kind of climb up you'll find
this<00:04:16.859> area<00:04:17.040> being<00:04:17.340> like<00:04:17.489> a<00:04:17.520> big<00:04:17.730> jagged<00:04:18.239> rock

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
this area being like a big jagged rock

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.510 
this area being like a big jagged rock
this<00:04:18.750> is<00:04:18.870> what<00:04:19.020> we<00:04:19.080> call<00:04:19.230> the<00:04:19.320> petrous<00:04:20.010> portion

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.520 
this is what we call the petrous portion

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.969 
this is what we call the petrous portion
or<00:04:20.760> you<00:04:21.630> know<00:04:21.720> petrified<00:04:22.290> I<00:04:22.320> always<00:04:22.770> think

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
or you know petrified I always think

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.400 
or you know petrified I always think
patron<00:04:23.580> is<00:04:23.760> rock-like<00:04:24.150> or<00:04:24.600> Peter<00:04:24.930> you<00:04:25.140> are<00:04:25.169> my

patron is rock-like or Peter you are my
rock

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
rock

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.350 
rock
that<00:04:26.500> is<00:04:26.860> the<00:04:27.220> petrous<00:04:27.610> portion<00:04:28.060> of<00:04:28.210> the

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
that is the petrous portion of the

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.059 
that is the petrous portion of the
temporal<00:04:28.810> bone<00:04:28.900> houses<00:04:29.409> our<00:04:29.530> inner<00:04:29.710> ear

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:30.069 
temporal bone houses our inner ear

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:31.890 
temporal bone houses our inner ear
places<00:04:30.789> where<00:04:30.939> you<00:04:31.030> hear<00:04:31.389> and<00:04:31.569> you<00:04:31.629> have<00:04:31.780> your

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
places where you hear and you have your

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.890 
places where you hear and you have your
balance<00:04:32.259> so<00:04:32.710> you<00:04:32.770> have<00:04:33.099> to<00:04:33.220> jump<00:04:33.550> down<00:04:33.900> into

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
balance so you have to jump down into

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.290 
balance so you have to jump down into
them<00:04:35.169> the<00:04:35.319> posterior<00:04:35.860> cranial<00:04:36.069> fossa<00:04:36.430> and<00:04:36.939> you

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
them the posterior cranial fossa and you

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.689 
them the posterior cranial fossa and you
would<00:04:37.419> find<00:04:37.569> yourself<00:04:38.009> jumping<00:04:39.009> over<00:04:39.310> a<00:04:39.340> hole

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
would find yourself jumping over a hole

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:42.869 
would find yourself jumping over a hole
as<00:04:40.030> you<00:04:40.419> can<00:04:40.539> see<00:04:40.689> here<00:04:41.370> this<00:04:42.370> hole<00:04:42.580> this<00:04:42.759> is

00:04:42.869 --> 00:04:42.879 
as you can see here this hole this is

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:44.790 
as you can see here this hole this is
called<00:04:43.060> the<00:04:43.150> internal<00:04:43.569> acoustic<00:04:43.960> meatus<00:04:44.229> or

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
called the internal acoustic meatus or

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.920 
called the internal acoustic meatus or
internal<00:04:45.280> auditory<00:04:45.610> canal<00:04:45.789> but<00:04:46.689> this<00:04:46.810> is

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
internal auditory canal but this is

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.959 
internal auditory canal but this is
where<00:04:47.110> cranial<00:04:47.830> nerve<00:04:47.979> number<00:04:48.189> seven<00:04:48.849> and

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
our body but still a foramen and then

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.939 
our body but still a foramen and then
you<00:05:10.180> can<00:05:10.300> see<00:05:10.419> this<00:05:10.539> larger<00:05:11.229> framing<00:05:11.620> as<00:05:11.710> well

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:11.949 
you can see this larger framing as well

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:14.309 
you can see this larger framing as well
this<00:05:12.250> larger<00:05:12.729> one<00:05:12.909> is<00:05:13.060> called<00:05:13.240> the<00:05:13.389> jugular

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:14.319 
this larger one is called the jugular

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:16.709 
this larger one is called the jugular
foramen<00:05:14.650> all<00:05:15.370> right<00:05:15.550> and<00:05:15.819> then<00:05:16.330> of<00:05:16.419> course<00:05:16.449> we

00:05:16.709 --> 00:05:16.719 
foramen all right and then of course we

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:20.959 
foramen all right and then of course we
have<00:05:16.810> the<00:05:16.930> internal<00:05:18.330> occipital<00:05:19.590> protuberance

00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:20.969 
have the internal occipital protuberance

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:26.040 
have the internal occipital protuberance
with<00:05:21.969> the<00:05:23.279> internal<00:05:24.509> nuchal<00:05:25.509> line<00:05:25.659> you<00:05:25.900> can

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
with the internal nuchal line you can

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.629 
with the internal nuchal line you can
see<00:05:26.199> those<00:05:26.379> there<00:05:26.680> and<00:05:26.830> then<00:05:27.250> the<00:05:27.370> occipital

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:27.639 
see those there and then the occipital

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.059 
see those there and then the occipital
crest<00:05:28.180> here<00:05:28.509> that's<00:05:29.169> what<00:05:29.469> we<00:05:29.590> have<00:05:29.800> and<00:05:29.979> then

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:30.069 
crest here that's what we have and then

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:32.100 
crest here that's what we have and then
of<00:05:30.219> course<00:05:30.430> these<00:05:30.669> are<00:05:30.940> now<00:05:31.539> the<00:05:31.599> posterior
