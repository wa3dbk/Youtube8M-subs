00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270 
Pantech Burst so if you guys enjoy that

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.990 
Pantech Burst so if you guys enjoy that
Oh<00:04:08.600> before<00:04:08.959> that<00:04:09.050> let<00:04:09.200> me<00:04:09.260> do<00:04:09.380> some<00:04:09.530> low<00:04:09.680> lights

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
Oh before that let me do some low lights

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.440 
Oh before that let me do some low lights
recording<00:04:11.000> -<00:04:11.239> I<00:04:11.570> almost<00:04:12.020> forgot<00:04:12.290> about<00:04:12.590> that

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
recording - I almost forgot about that

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.030 
recording - I almost forgot about that
give<00:04:14.450> you<00:04:14.540> a<00:04:14.600> nice<00:04:14.780> area<00:04:15.200> where<00:04:15.410> you<00:04:15.650> know<00:04:15.800> like

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
give you a nice area where you know like

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:28.210 
give you a nice area where you know like
this<00:04:16.780> of<00:04:17.780> course<00:04:24.970> you<00:04:26.080> can<00:04:27.080> see<00:04:27.260> the<00:04:27.620> stairwell

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
this of course you can see the stairwell

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.780 
this of course you can see the stairwell
very<00:04:29.060> well<00:04:29.270> here<00:04:29.540> does<00:04:30.380> a<00:04:30.410> good<00:04:30.560> job<00:04:30.620> so<00:04:30.980> anyway

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 
very well here does a good job so anyway

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.640 
very well here does a good job so anyway
we'll<00:04:31.970> ended<00:04:32.180> up<00:04:32.300> and<00:04:32.540> continue<00:04:33.050> the<00:04:33.200> air<00:04:33.410> for

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
we'll ended up and continue the air for

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:40.120 
we'll ended up and continue the air for
me<00:04:35.290> now<00:04:36.290> overall<00:04:36.710> the<00:04:37.930> the<00:04:38.930> operating<00:04:39.860> system

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
me now overall the the operating system

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.120 
me now overall the the operating system
runs<00:04:40.310> very<00:04:40.490> smooth<00:04:40.970> it<00:04:41.479> has<00:04:41.750> a<00:04:41.930> 1.2<00:04:42.530> dual-core

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
runs very smooth it has a 1.2 dual-core

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.030 
runs very smooth it has a 1.2 dual-core
processor<00:04:43.930> which<00:04:44.930> goes<00:04:45.470> a<00:04:45.500> long<00:04:45.710> way<00:04:45.979> in

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
processor which goes a long way in

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.540 
processor which goes a long way in
actually<00:04:46.520> adding<00:04:46.880> a<00:04:47.419> lot<00:04:48.410> of<00:04:48.440> smoothness<00:04:49.190> and

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
actually adding a lot of smoothness and

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
actually adding a lot of smoothness and
speed<00:04:49.760> towards<00:04:50.330> the<00:04:50.479> operating<00:04:50.960> system

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
speed towards the operating system

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.940 
speed towards the operating system
overall<00:04:53.570> not<00:04:53.810> a<00:04:53.840> simple<00:04:54.140> look<00:04:54.290> at<00:04:54.410> the<00:04:54.560> speed

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
overall not a simple look at the speed

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.909 
overall not a simple look at the speed
test<00:04:55.190> here<00:04:55.810> from<00:04:56.810> prior<00:04:57.440> experience<00:04:57.860> with

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
test here from prior experience with

00:04:57.919 --> 00:04:59.920 
test here from prior experience with
speed<00:04:58.160> test<00:04:58.400> which<00:04:58.550> I've<00:04:58.760> arrived<00:04:59.270> with<00:04:59.600> AT&amp;T

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
speed test which I've arrived with AT&amp;T

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.110 
speed test which I've arrived with AT&amp;T
we've<00:05:00.290> got<00:05:00.470> some<00:05:00.770> very<00:05:01.100> good<00:05:01.130> speeds<00:05:01.520> upwards

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
we've got some very good speeds upwards

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.780 
we've got some very good speeds upwards
of<00:05:02.270> 30<00:05:02.740> megabits<00:05:03.740> per<00:05:03.860> second<00:05:04.310> well<00:05:04.520> let's<00:05:04.669> see

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
of 30 megabits per second well let's see

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:09.340 
of 30 megabits per second well let's see
what<00:05:04.910> we<00:05:05.000> get<00:05:05.210> today

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.940 

so<00:05:09.920> we<00:05:10.070> had<00:05:10.600> 44<00:05:11.600> megabits<00:05:12.140> per<00:05:12.230> second<00:05:12.710> so<00:05:12.830> this

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
so we had 44 megabits per second so this

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.120 
so we had 44 megabits per second so this
is<00:05:13.130> twice<00:05:13.550> my<00:05:14.000> home<00:05:14.210> network<00:05:14.860> try<00:05:15.860> that<00:05:16.010> one

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
is twice my home network try that one

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.550 
is twice my home network try that one
more<00:05:16.220> time

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.480 

and<00:05:22.540> upload<00:05:23.540> speeds<00:05:23.720> of<00:05:24.110> about<00:05:24.200> 12<00:05:24.860> so<00:05:25.190> this<00:05:25.310> is

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
and upload speeds of about 12 so this is

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.850 
and upload speeds of about 12 so this is
CD<00:05:25.700> I<00:05:25.850> got<00:05:26.000> some<00:05:26.120> results<00:05:26.300> here<00:05:26.630> so<00:05:26.860> the

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
CD I got some results here so the

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.770 
CD I got some results here so the
highest<00:05:28.160> upload<00:05:28.490> speeds<00:05:28.760> we<00:05:28.940> go<00:05:29.060> were<00:05:29.240> 22

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
highest upload speeds we go were 22

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.450 
highest upload speeds we go were 22
megabits<00:05:30.230> per<00:05:30.320> second<00:05:30.650> which<00:05:30.770> is<00:05:30.800> very<00:05:30.950> high

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
megabits per second which is very high

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.690 
megabits per second which is very high
for<00:05:31.490> the<00:05:32.000> speed<00:05:32.270> so<00:05:32.510> you<00:05:32.540> can<00:05:32.810> see<00:05:33.700> especially

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
for the speed so you can see especially

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.510 
for the speed so you can see especially
the<00:05:35.000> device<00:05:35.240> of<00:05:35.450> this<00:05:35.600> price<00:05:35.870> range<00:05:36.370> going<00:05:37.370> at

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
the device of this price range going at

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.820 
the device of this price range going at
$49.99<00:05:38.090> and<00:05:38.930> you're<00:05:39.380> getting<00:05:40.030> 18<00:05:41.030> sees<00:05:41.210> 4G<00:05:41.630> LTE

getting a very good package so let's

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.430 
getting a very good package so let's
round<00:05:55.460> up<00:05:55.670> this<00:05:55.820> video<00:05:56.090> and<00:05:56.270> tell<00:05:57.230> you<00:05:57.320> my

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 
round up this video and tell you my

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.610 
round up this video and tell you my

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
thoughts on the Pantech Burst so we've

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.380 
thoughts on the Pantech Burst so we've
taken<00:06:00.710> a<00:06:00.890> good<00:06:01.010> look<00:06:01.190> at<00:06:01.430> the<00:06:01.640> Pantech<00:06:02.360> Burst

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:02.390 
taken a good look at the Pantech Burst

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.050 
taken a good look at the Pantech Burst
and<00:06:02.960> patrick<00:06:03.650> has<00:06:03.740> done<00:06:03.950> a<00:06:03.980> very<00:06:04.340> good<00:06:04.460> job<00:06:04.580> in
