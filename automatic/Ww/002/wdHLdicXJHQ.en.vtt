it's<00:02:06.780> going<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.049> be<00:02:07.170> super<00:02:07.770> super<00:02:08.069> easy<00:02:08.310> test

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
it's going to be super super easy test

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.859 
it's going to be super super easy test
where<00:02:08.970> I'm<00:02:09.060> going<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.330> make<00:02:09.450> sure<00:02:09.599> that<00:02:09.750> you

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
where I'm going to make sure that you

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.900 
where I'm going to make sure that you
can<00:02:10.020> fire<00:02:10.259> your<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:10.800> think<00:02:11.190> Manuel<00:02:11.370> weapon

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
can fire your I think Manuel weapon

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.250 
can fire your I think Manuel weapon
pretty<00:02:12.150> fast<00:02:12.390> it's<00:02:12.660> not<00:02:12.810> even<00:02:13.020> going<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.170> be

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
pretty fast it's not even going to be

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.580 
pretty fast it's not even going to be
that

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
that

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.589 
that
long<00:02:13.680> you're<00:02:13.920> just<00:02:14.129> gonna<00:02:14.569> you're<00:02:15.569> just

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
long you're just gonna you're just

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.240 
long you're just gonna you're just
basically<00:02:15.989> shoot<00:02:16.470> it<00:02:16.590> off<00:02:16.709> I'm<00:02:16.950> going<00:02:17.069> to<00:02:17.160> see

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
basically shoot it off I'm going to see

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.119 
basically shoot it off I'm going to see
how<00:02:17.340> fast<00:02:18.080> unlike<00:02:19.080> i<00:02:19.200> said<00:02:19.379> before<00:02:19.500> though<00:02:19.920> i

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
how fast unlike i said before though i

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.280 
how fast unlike i said before though i
want<00:02:20.489> it's<00:02:21.060> not<00:02:21.269> necessarily<00:02:21.720> how<00:02:21.840> fast<00:02:22.110> you

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
want it's not necessarily how fast you

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.290 
want it's not necessarily how fast you
can<00:02:22.349> fire<00:02:22.620> with<00:02:22.830> your<00:02:22.950> accuracy<00:02:23.430> if<00:02:24.030> you're

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
can fire with your accuracy if you're

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.910 
can fire with your accuracy if you're
accurate<00:02:24.599> with<00:02:25.080> these<00:02:25.230> weapons<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:25.769> don't

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
accurate with these weapons you don't

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.979 
accurate with these weapons you don't
need<00:02:26.190> to<00:02:26.340> have<00:02:26.489> an<00:02:26.670> ultra-fast<00:02:27.180> firing<00:02:27.810> rate

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
need to have an ultra-fast firing rate

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.430 
need to have an ultra-fast firing rate
my<00:02:28.739> accuracy<00:02:29.220> is<00:02:29.489> atrocious<00:02:30.410> therefore<00:02:31.410> I

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
my accuracy is atrocious therefore I

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.280 
my accuracy is atrocious therefore I
need<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.010> fast<00:02:32.310> firing<00:02:32.790> rate<00:02:33.060> because<00:02:33.959> I<00:02:33.989> have

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
need a fast firing rate because I have

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.650 
need a fast firing rate because I have
to<00:02:34.319> actually<00:02:34.680> spray<00:02:35.430> with<00:02:35.790> my<00:02:36.000> handgun<00:02:36.390> which

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
to actually spray with my handgun which

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.570 
to actually spray with my handgun which
is<00:02:36.810> why<00:02:36.930> I<00:02:36.959> usually<00:02:37.410> use<00:02:37.560> extended<00:02:38.160> mags<00:02:38.370> with

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
is why I usually use extended mags with

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.900 
is why I usually use extended mags with
the<00:02:38.700> m9<00:02:39.260> or<00:02:40.260> even<00:02:40.860> with<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.160> akimbo<00:02:41.610> you'll

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
the m9 or even with the akimbo you'll

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.100 
the m9 or even with the akimbo you'll
notice<00:02:42.239> that<00:02:42.269> if<00:02:42.480> you<00:02:42.569> watch<00:02:42.780> any<00:02:42.930> of<00:02:42.989> my

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
notice that if you watch any of my

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.920 
notice that if you watch any of my
videos<00:02:43.140> of<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.709> agency<00:02:44.099> videos<00:02:44.340> I<00:02:44.690> spray<00:02:45.690> like

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
videos of the agency videos I spray like

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.140 
videos of the agency videos I spray like

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
crazy because that's really that's my

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.020 
crazy because that's really that's my
thing<00:02:48.420> I'm<00:02:48.630> fast<00:02:49.110> with<00:02:49.349> the<00:02:49.440> triggers<00:02:50.000> but<00:02:51.000> I

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
thing I'm fast with the triggers but I

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.430 
thing I'm fast with the triggers but I
need<00:02:51.209> to<00:02:51.329> spray<00:02:51.510> because<00:02:51.630> my<00:02:51.840> aunt<00:02:51.959> Chrissy<00:02:52.319> is

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
garbage but the other members of NDT

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.330 
garbage but the other members of NDT
elite<00:02:54.959> are<00:02:55.170> not<00:02:55.440> their<00:02:55.709> accuracy<00:02:56.040> is<00:02:56.190> way

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
elite are not their accuracy is way

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.550 
elite are not their accuracy is way
better<00:02:56.519> i<00:02:56.670> think<00:02:56.880> the<00:02:56.970> dena<00:02:57.180> for<00:02:57.390> life<00:02:57.560> might

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
better i think the dena for life might

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.309 
better i think the dena for life might
have<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.920> highest<00:02:59.099> accuracy<00:02:59.670> of<00:03:00.329> Alban<00:03:01.140> wide

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319
