 by the organizer of the event but 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.340
 we advise you to come despite 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.260
 everything with your own land it's 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.040
 more careful 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.440
 then what I advise you to 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.459
 to do is to place first even before 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.319
 to read your car to classify them by 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.480
 color and within each color of 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.160
 classify them by increasing cost of the 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.390
 less expensive to the most expensive and once 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.730
 that you did this sorting job 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.750
 you will be able to start reading your 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.090
 cards that will allow you to have a 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.890
 better legibility of your game of your 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.370
 options is to build a game in 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.870
 result 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.540
 me for example I had the opportunity 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.889
 to leave with our cola packs win 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.579
 I had the opportunity to leave on a 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:23.810
 extremely aggressive game simply I 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.549
 did not have a lot of pickaxe hours this 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.139
 which made me afraid of having the 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.310
 second wind needed to complete 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:28.790
 my opponent I was afraid to be a 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.590
 just not fair 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.930
 so I preferred to go for a day 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.700
 more versatile that could adapt 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.200
 depending on the opponent's game 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.639
 it's a game that will be slower 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.440
 that a game agropur but who will be able 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:40.730
 go into aggressive mode or it's a game 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.989
 who will be able to try to temporize 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.650
 until I have time to ask 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.700
 one of these four wonderful dragon 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.100
 so when I made a choice in my 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.299
 creatures I rather than take the 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.069
 creatures that was purely agro 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:53.450
 purely control I preferred to take 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.340
 creatures maybe a little bit more 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.260
 intermediate but also more 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.150
 versatile that I will be able to use 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.010
 indifference in an undifferentiated way 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.019
 as well as blocker if I have in 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.250
 face me an aggressive opponent or 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:08.030
 as an attacker if I have in front of me 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.290
 an opponent rather control so here 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.819
 you see my main creatures 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.040
 especially this with the deadly contact that 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.540
 represents this idea well we sometimes 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.099
 scruples to block creatures 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.269
 with the deadly touch so that's 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:19.910
 often creatures that will be able 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.010
 cross the opposing defenses and has 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.800
 contrario it's creatures the one with 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.419
 the dead contact 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.009
 that we will be able to use in 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.870
 defensive to block the threats 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:29.069
 adverse 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.539
 I also here a number 

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:32.699
 of antibes is that I could use 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:34.319
 in two different ways either 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:36.750
 aggressive mode to create gaps 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:38.729
 in the defenses of my opponent either 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.120
 in control mode to delay 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:43.770
 save time to have the time to 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.659
 final to ask one of these four 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.520
 dragons that should allow me to 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:48.960

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.300
