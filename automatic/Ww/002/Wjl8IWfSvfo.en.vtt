earth<00:04:00.090> if<00:04:00.450> it<00:04:00.570> wasn't<00:04:00.870> awesome<00:04:00.990> I<00:04:01.440> think<00:04:02.040> it

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
earth if it wasn't awesome I think it

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.440 
earth if it wasn't awesome I think it
was<00:04:02.220> though<00:04:02.460> and<00:04:02.670> I<00:04:02.730> think<00:04:02.790> he<00:04:03.060> doesn't<00:04:03.270> mean

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
was though and I think he doesn't mean

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.330 
was though and I think he doesn't mean
like<00:04:03.950> take<00:04:04.950> a<00:04:04.980> guess<00:04:05.220> and<00:04:06.120> that's<00:04:06.270> her<00:04:06.450> blinch

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
like take a guess and that's her blinch

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.630 
like take a guess and that's her blinch
to<00:04:08.340> the<00:04:08.460> fish<00:04:08.730> fan<00:04:08.970> as<00:04:09.150> well<00:04:09.180> um<00:04:10.160> so<00:04:11.160> maybe<00:04:11.460> it's

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
to the fish fan as well um so maybe it's

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.039 
to the fish fan as well um so maybe it's
my<00:04:11.700> clinches<00:04:12.240> influence<00:04:12.690> that<00:04:13.140> has<00:04:13.620> me
