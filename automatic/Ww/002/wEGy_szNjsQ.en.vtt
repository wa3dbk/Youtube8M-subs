also<00:00:24.960> can<00:00:25.199> boost<00:00:25.410> insulin<00:00:25.920> sensitivity<00:00:26.369> if

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
also can boost insulin sensitivity if

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:27.859 
also can boost insulin sensitivity if
you've<00:00:26.820> been<00:00:26.939> following<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:27.449> know<00:00:27.599> that<00:00:27.750> this

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
you've been following you know that this

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.570 
you've been following you know that this
is<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.050> huge<00:00:28.380> thing<00:00:28.619> insulin<00:00:29.010> sensitivity<00:00:29.340> is

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
is a huge thing insulin sensitivity is

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.009 
is a huge thing insulin sensitivity is
very<00:00:29.640> important<00:00:30.210> because<00:00:30.359> your<00:00:30.599> brain<00:00:30.810> cells

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
very important because your brain cells

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.810 
very important because your brain cells
rely<00:00:31.380> on<00:00:31.410> glucose<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.130> insulin<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.610> way

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
rely on glucose and insulin is the way

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.549 
rely on glucose and insulin is the way
in<00:00:32.910> which<00:00:33.059> glucose<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:33.690> shuttled<00:00:34.110> into<00:00:34.350> your

studies<00:00:37.200> show<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:37.380> cocoa<00:00:38.010> flavanols<00:00:38.280> can

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
studies show that cocoa flavanols can

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.240 
studies show that cocoa flavanols can
reverse<00:00:38.969> age-related<00:00:39.750> cognitive<00:00:40.230> decline<00:00:40.710> so

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
reverse age-related cognitive decline so

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.709 
reverse age-related cognitive decline so
this<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.520> great<00:00:41.760> thing<00:00:41.969> cocoa<00:00:42.480> flavanols

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
this is a great thing cocoa flavanols

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.630 
this is a great thing cocoa flavanols
are<00:00:43.050> also<00:00:43.260> really<00:00:43.860> good<00:00:44.100> for<00:00:44.160> your<00:00:44.430> heart

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
are also really good for your heart

are also really good for your heart
health<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.360> also<00:00:45.510> important<00:00:46.050> to

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
health and this is also important to

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.139 
health and this is also important to
breathe<00:00:46.320> now<00:00:46.440> they<00:00:46.739> seem<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.039> relax<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.760> thin

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
breathe now they seem to relax the thin

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.750 
breathe now they seem to relax the thin
layer<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.420> cells<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.079> line<00:00:49.530> your<00:00:49.920> veins<00:00:50.550> and

that the chocolate that you're consuming
has<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.550> flavanols<00:01:00.000> in<00:01:00.180> them<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.420> are<00:01:00.539> said

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
has the flavanols in them that are said

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.900 
has the flavanols in them that are said
to<00:01:01.379> have<00:01:01.710> these<00:01:01.949> benefits<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.579> so<00:01:02.670> how<00:01:02.789> do<00:01:02.850> you

know which chocolaty so here are two
very<00:01:05.129> common<00:01:05.580> chocolate<00:01:06.030> bars<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:06.780> picked

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
very common chocolate bars that I picked

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.950 
very common chocolate bars that I picked
up<00:01:07.590> just<00:01:07.860> from<00:01:08.100> my<00:01:08.250> local<00:01:08.640> CVS<00:01:09.210> now<00:01:09.600> in<00:01:09.750> general

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
up just from my local CVS now in general

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.140 
up just from my local CVS now in general
you<00:01:10.380> want<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.830> higher<00:01:11.130> percentage<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.820> cacao

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
you want the higher percentage of cacao

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.969 
you want the higher percentage of cacao
because<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.750> basically<00:01:13.170> elbows<00:01:13.619> out<00:01:13.770> room

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
because that basically elbows out room

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.770 
because that basically elbows out room
for<00:01:14.220> sugar<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:15.119> you're<00:01:15.270> getting<00:01:15.540> more

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
for sugar and so you're getting more

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.359 
for sugar and so you're getting more
cocoa<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.590> want<00:01:16.740> this<00:01:16.830> cocoa<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.189> be<00:01:17.310> in

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
cocoa and you want this cocoa to be in

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.160 
cocoa and you want this cocoa to be in
the<00:01:17.430> form<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.670> cocoa<00:01:17.970> solids<00:01:18.390> not<00:01:18.810> cocoa

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
the form of cocoa solids not cocoa

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.390 
the form of cocoa solids not cocoa
butter<00:01:19.409> definitely<00:01:19.920> don't<00:01:20.040> want<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.250> first

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
butter definitely don't want the first
