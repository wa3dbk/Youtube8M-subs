00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.750

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.030
 invitations and in today's video I will 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.469
 Talk about remix that got better 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.360
 than the original games 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.190
 who does not have an old game they like 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.010
 God damn that feeling of 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.690
 nostalgia every time he plays and gets 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.270
 apprehensive when the company announced 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.800
 a remake of it or the video of today I will 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.380
 talk about some of these games that 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.000
 really are examples of how games 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.730
 should be redone 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.790
 come on, our first game today is 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.640
 easy 94 that went out for android s 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.170
 nintendo ds originally and pc more 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.050
 recently the game tells the story of the 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.629
 cesium a black knight who ends up 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.969
 abandoning this return of his crimes 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.289
 because he was a good citizen of a paladin 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.930
 It's beautiful, and something. 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.820
 and in fact I will look for fucking 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.469
 me so the best final fantasy that has 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.989
 even better than the seventh game has a 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.879
 of the best stories I've ever seen him 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.309
 has several of the end innovations 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.809
 he 's a classic ghost 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.550
 and in fact it is a game that 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.010
 introduced all the news 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.619
 practically from the old system that was 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.110
 until the end fantasy 10 more or less 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.090
 the game won new graphics new system 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.970
 He's hard as hell still is. 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.009
 really well to win one for action 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.600
 sensational and it was really fucking me 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.729
 I highly recommend it to anyone who never 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.560
 played the final fantasy and that is to enter 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.320
 head on face in history 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.340
 bought four and plays because it is 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.409
 sensational 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.299
 according to journalist metroids hiromi 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.180
 xandro game divan boy if it's a remake 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.250
 the subway and the original pronese and he and 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.320
 against the beginning of the adventure we dance 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.619
 when it faces space pirates 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.360
 for the first time hitler and fashion b e 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.430
 Such a game is sensational. 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.920
 totally redone he won the indy 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.960
 metroid fusion actually not 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.759
 some improvements in relation to this game 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.100
 also he also won the module 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.860
 end of the game loses all armor 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.799
 Then you have to make a make hotel. 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.930
 fetal ship inside a grate ship 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.000
 space to get work back and 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.009
 face a mega ridley at the end of the 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.990
 game that is one of the fucking fights that 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.599
 It has a game that really is very good if 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.489
 you've never played amateur plays or 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.750
 so the theft I think he is 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.540
 available what 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.640
 Gold holding a shopping 3ds 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.960
 even and enjoy because he is sensible 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.970
 to the same 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.190
 speaking of boy couch if he was also 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.100
 to the house of pokémon say net and a little book 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.020
 remake of pokémon red green is what are the 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.540
 original pokémons such as the 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.570
 original program despite saying 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.750
 despite setting fire to the map as 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.920
 one of the best of all times 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.709
 aged very poorly and nintendo 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.050
 he upgraded himself to a system that 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.190
 he put it in ruby ​​pokémon india 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.170
 sapphire right 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.930
 the game to this day can be played in a good 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.480
 embolador in your ninth game you always 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.730
 see it and it would even be cool if Nintendo 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.100
 Please retry the game in case 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.760
 placing heleno in the indy in the current 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.930
 Pokémon 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.459
 but the one made in 2004 does not lose 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.250
 nothing really does not lose much 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.900
 for today 's next game in our 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.660
 list is the rescue and remake that 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.930
 recently left for research 43 of the 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.400
 box 360 pc and xbox the year the game in 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.799
 Truthfully, he usually left the game. 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.540
 movie, and he's a fucking fuck and 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.190
 so it 's actually for me he's a 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.769
 model of communion that was to be 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.600
 because it takes all the gameplay 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.549
 of the executive and give a 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.720
 updated and puts better graphics 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.850
 question but he can keep 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.760
 totally the soul of the original game 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.350
 the game takes place within the kind of 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.880
 bug and such 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.650
 he has to survive he discovered that 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.690
 Carol is happening and everything. 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.370
 and in addition it gained an expansion of 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.000
 content in fact the game has many 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.140
 novelties in relation to the original 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.390
 despite all stay with that 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.070
 feeling Taio've done it once in 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.760
 Life, I know more or less what goes 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.739
 happen but it's still a novelty. 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.320
 Recomendadissimo is our mission we 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.850
 we have tomb raider anniversary the first 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.620
 tomb raider is impossible to play now 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.350
 day it is really very bad 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.000
 has aged very poorly and unfortunately 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.150
 crystal dynamics before it was even 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.980
 bought by the enix school launched October 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.019
 and drivers and to give an update on 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.450
 gameplay clothes and a pair and 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:18.390
 losing at launch but the game stays 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.370
 more like a boring life he 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.380
 in fact it focuses more on the plans and such 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.780
 as tomb raider was originally 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.000
 well, he gets the whole story 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.560
 original game and updates and places a 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.300
 better gameplay better graphics 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.250
 but what really recommended it 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.290
 so for those who want to play with lara 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.370

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.200
 new 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.790
 Good people, we stay here, enjoy yourself.
