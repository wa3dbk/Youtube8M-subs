00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.720
 hi to all and welcome 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.870
 after i'm anti 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.370
 so 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.990
 apparently 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.180
 as I do not know but we know after 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.310
 the hand the world is acceptable 750 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.470
 convoy android 4.0 totally room and 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.960
 so this is his last under android 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.950
 so she's pretty good 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.240
 so we can see all the 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.650
 features a 7-inch screen 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.090
 good is the smallest we can have 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.410
 but you this tablet is really 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.110
 low-end one should not expect to 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.130
 something phenomenal so already I 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.530
 do not think we can run 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.239
 3d games cars games or games 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.030
 role but thinks that for the internet and 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.250
 the mails will be perfect kajiya zugaj 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.350
 a 3D compatible microsd displays four 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.059
 years of the jcat video hd wifi and a 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.629
 camera do not think the camera on the 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.760
 vdn 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.850
 an opulence we will return to see what has 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.370
 so wanted to finish that it's normal for a 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.660
 Tablet things she found 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.489
 it could be handy for Skype 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.469
 but I'm not even fired knew enough 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.179
 fast for them for the quality of 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.559
 stage communications so now 

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:06.570
 we will talk because it is here that we can 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.000
 say in French so here is lcd screen 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.690
 resolution of 800 by 480 a processor 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.479
 arm cortex a8 1 gigahertz is rather not 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.600
 wrong 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.860
 So here is for me the model of gpu in 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.690
 ramallah 512 megabytes 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.420
 it's hands for a tablet of 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.530
 chocolate in france the chance to have 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.120
 between 50 and 60 euros 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.730
 this moment the first price but it can 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.320
 not seem bad to start for 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.490
 that's what it's pretty handy 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.990
 now are we going 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.450
 we go to the opening but the 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.080
 dealers who accurately show one 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.110
 mini usb 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.670
 so that's cool and that's what there is 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.400
 it's that apparently on the way that 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.690
 writes that she has a 3d acceleration my 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.830
 side I get along it's the skin the 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.150
 hair but I'm really not sure 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.150
 so we 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:02:00.050
 I'm thinking of coming here so she is 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.790
 rather beautiful natural was less 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.920
 packed again he alone was brand new 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.810
 I do it back to the sides all that 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.170
 could see it's like the story 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.040
 will tackle the table if last 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.310
 so what did we do with 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.080
 we buy an old balloon there I am a 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.860
 little disappointed I was expecting a charger 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.390
 usb 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.090
 when as we used to see on 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.550
 this kind of product good it does not matter 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.320
 so what is called a the 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.200
 cable the proof is causing so 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.270
 this is a kind 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.190
 that's it's mini usb for usb so that 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.890
 it's not bad so it'll be added to 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.160
 that and I think so have not even 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.640
 I do not know just a mini usb 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.890
 then it can be cool 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.470
 the record of the course and the three 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.900
 French languages ​​German and English I 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.270
 think and so here we did not 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.190
 shown more intimate things is so 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.190
 now will start the tablet 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.959
 here we are going to start 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.130
 so before the album workouts and 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.110
 gamma his films it's pretty cool no 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:04.670
 cassis engine back so warned on 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:07.480
 plastic bags are not in a hurry 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.480
 to do otherwise 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.959
 I hope she is charged 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.910
 it's his tomato so this video puts 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.170
 logically normally so they are 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.510
 had then what is it like 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.190
 hookup there is the headphones 5 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.680
 volts it's for usb charging 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.660
 so that's of course a mini usb their 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.750
 share their more or less the ball to 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.330
 the usap to light it and the washer 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.180
 so not under title start this 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.410
 supporter 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.670
 so here we go the robot android who 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.140
 appears 200 people go well what 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.560
 are your wrinkles but hey that's all 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.780
 is normal 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.240
 the logically interactive brand 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.640
 and android so that's it tomorrow 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.650
 I think the startup have to 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.120
 take about ten seconds and 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.400
 so will find you immediately 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.530
 go ahead so we start right away 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.450
 first start so the scientist says 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.460
 still just really managed price has 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.780
 did others I just played a few 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.630
 seconds to configure the wifi like 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.340
 belhouari site and so that's 80% of 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.810
 matrix rather not bad as the purchase so 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.280
 the touch is still super g 20 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.320
 for a tablet to his grand tower and 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.210
 not waiting at all for his talent him 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.250
 answer a lot there good polar this ut 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:16.370
 internet but will serve as the second and 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.540
 the store a lot of application we're going 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.670
 give up their rights to the Russians 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.930
 I really have nothing on the home screen 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.700
 because it's really prime 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.680
 startup one goes the applications that 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.810
 are given with so already we have some 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.820
 utilities so all that is rather 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.960
 classic so we on the agenda that is 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.550
 found if the camera the 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.580
 calculates the emails you have 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.870
 configured through your account 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.320
 the photo gallery the manager of 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.470
 Documents 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.880
 the clock the blind the tape recorder the 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.720
 music that is very difficult for this 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.270
 kind of device 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.550
 the same browser and settings 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.290
 and so you want to show as his 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.330
 speed on google so we got this 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.870
 browser like it's android google in 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.370
 home page 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.220
 and here we are and she is fast enough 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.560
 it's pretty good 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:01.340
 and so if for example we can search 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.260
 news I have done more 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.540
 asked twenty one a very busy back 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:09.290
 since that I say that I read so 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:12.200
 hop more I know I do not know his 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:14.300
 time to search for a google page but 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.350
 I think it'll be fast so we 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.390
 go see what it gives 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.390
 bombay it's very fast it's really 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:21.470
 really not bad so for that I 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.400
 did not expect that at all I did not 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.870
 not even sure that I'm running and 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.090
 internet reasonably 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.850
 so you see we see the pictures that 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.350
 goes down really well it's fluid and we 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:31.280
 can see the videos I think because 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.130
 that she already has a lot of format and 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:38.000
 so here they do what android 4 be 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:40.460
 not bad but it is sure that and not sell 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.720
 to the highest point so I think that 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.470
 I also showed the widget 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:47.660
 as for Alexandria 4 - 0 base so he 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.580
 just go to see coach right from the 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.129
 pop in send we are the favorites 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.149
 network the football gallery 

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:57.069
 the emails and the power supply controller 

00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:58.959
 moncla I will not play games but I 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:00.279
 think it will not happen anyway 

00:05:58.959 --> 00:06:01.959
 even though I know that I underestimate them 

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:03.699
 not bad so I'm very smiling and 

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:07.989
 internet speed and we'll stop there 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:11.550
 So thank you subscribe and to love and 

00:06:07.989 --> 00:06:11.550
 please comment hi
