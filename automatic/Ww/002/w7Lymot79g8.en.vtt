 installation goes in your face but that's how it is 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.499
 and that you immediately choose 

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:22.879
 And then the theme of course depends a bit on what you do with you 

00:00:22.879 --> 00:00:24.329
 want to do a competition 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:26.099

 how important that is 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.569
 on google 

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:34.910
