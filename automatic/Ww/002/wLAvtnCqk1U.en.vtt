both hemispheres of your brain in a
nutshell<00:00:15.289> most<00:00:16.289> people<00:00:16.680> either<00:00:16.830> use<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.250> left

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
nutshell most people either use the left

technique does is it allows you to
slowly<00:00:24.060> develop<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.750> ability<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:25.199> access

average person and the reason I believe
that<00:00:50.879> they<00:00:50.969> were<00:00:51.030> able<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.360> do<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.809> was<00:00:52.500> that

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
that they were able to do that was that

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.680 
that they were able to do that was that
they<00:00:52.920> probably<00:00:53.489> stumbled<00:00:54.000> across<00:00:54.270> something

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
they probably stumbled across something

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.479 
they probably stumbled across something
very<00:00:55.020> similar<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.770> what<00:00:55.890> I'm<00:00:55.980> going<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.280> teach

room<00:01:49.320> or<00:01:49.439> something<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.009> get<00:01:50.700> distracted

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
room or something and you get distracted

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.969 
room or something and you get distracted
mentally<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.990> sound<00:01:52.229> will<00:01:52.409> actually<00:01:52.680> fade

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
mentally the sound will actually fade

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.639 
mentally the sound will actually fade
down<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.490> lower<00:01:53.759> decibel<00:01:54.060> as<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:55.229> begin<00:01:55.500> to

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
down to a lower decibel as you begin to

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.139 
down to a lower decibel as you begin to
listen<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.280> again<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.579> actually<00:01:56.729> will<00:01:57.060> get

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
listen to it again it actually will get

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.810 
listen to it again it actually will get
louder<00:01:57.570> again<00:01:58.140> now<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.950> interesting<00:01:59.399> thing

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
louder again now the interesting thing

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.149 
louder again now the interesting thing
is<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.869> actually<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.350> stronger<00:02:02.040> if

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
is is that it actually is stronger if

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.010 
is is that it actually is stronger if
you<00:02:02.250> put<00:02:02.460> earplugs<00:02:02.729> in<00:02:03.240> some<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.659> those<00:02:03.719> foam

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
you put earplugs in some of those foam

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.859 
you put earplugs in some of those foam
ones<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.469> roll<00:02:04.649> into<00:02:04.799> your<00:02:05.040> ears<00:02:05.280> or<00:02:05.869> if

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
ones that you roll into your ears or if

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.260 
ones that you roll into your ears or if
you<00:02:07.140> go<00:02:07.590> anywhere<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.250> can<00:02:08.399> hear<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:09.000> sound

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
you go anywhere you can hear the sound

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.300 
you go anywhere you can hear the sound
there<00:02:09.539> is<00:02:09.690> no<00:02:09.929> source<00:02:10.319> for<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:10.739> it<00:02:10.890> comes<00:02:11.129> from

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
there is no source for it it comes from

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.619 
there is no source for it it comes from
your<00:02:11.459> own<00:02:11.520> consciousness

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629

the<00:02:14.629> trick<00:02:14.900> to<00:02:15.110> getting<00:02:15.530> both<00:02:15.799> hemispheres<00:02:16.099> to

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
the trick to getting both hemispheres to

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.199 
the trick to getting both hemispheres to
turn<00:02:17.030> on<00:02:17.299> is<00:02:17.890> when<00:02:18.890> you<00:02:19.040> start<00:02:19.340> to<00:02:19.489> find<00:02:19.700> the

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
turn on is when you start to find the

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.420 
turn on is when you start to find the
one<00:02:20.510> hemisphere<00:02:21.379> or<00:02:21.560> the<00:02:21.650> once<00:02:21.829> sound<00:02:22.220> that

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
one hemisphere or the once sound that

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.339 
one hemisphere or the once sound that
you're<00:02:22.549> hearing<00:02:22.579> you<00:02:23.329> want<00:02:23.540> to<00:02:23.629> focus<00:02:23.840> on<00:02:24.140> it

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
you're hearing you want to focus on it

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.619 
you're hearing you want to focus on it
and<00:02:24.799> very<00:02:24.950> gently<00:02:25.459> you<00:02:25.760> want<00:02:26.180> to<00:02:26.360> move<00:02:26.569> your

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:26.629 
and very gently you want to move your

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:28.869 
and very gently you want to move your
concentration<00:02:27.439> to<00:02:27.709> your<00:02:27.860> other<00:02:28.040> ear<00:02:28.519> or<00:02:28.730> the

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
concentration to your other ear or the

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:30.880 
concentration to your other ear or the
zone<00:02:29.180> of<00:02:29.480> your<00:02:29.690> ear<00:02:30.019> and<00:02:30.560> you're<00:02:30.680> going<00:02:30.860> to

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
zone of your ear and you're going to

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.229 
zone of your ear and you're going to
hear<00:02:31.099> a<00:02:31.129> much<00:02:31.519> fainter<00:02:32.530> tone<00:02:33.530> and<00:02:33.860> as<00:02:34.760> you

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
hear a much fainter tone and as you

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.030 
hear a much fainter tone and as you
concentrate<00:02:35.959> you<00:02:36.140> try<00:02:36.319> to<00:02:36.379> pay<00:02:36.590> attention<00:02:36.829> to

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
concentrate you try to pay attention to

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.920 
concentrate you try to pay attention to
it<00:02:37.220> it's<00:02:37.370> going<00:02:37.579> to<00:02:37.700> grow<00:02:37.909> louder<00:02:38.239> and<00:02:38.659> louder

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
it it's going to grow louder and louder

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.619 
it it's going to grow louder and louder
and<00:02:39.319> louder<00:02:39.530> until<00:02:39.859> eventually<00:02:40.670> it<00:02:40.970> matches

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:41.629 
and louder until eventually it matches

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:43.569 
and louder until eventually it matches
the<00:02:41.780> same<00:02:41.810> sound<00:02:42.470> pitch<00:02:42.799> or<00:02:43.040> at<00:02:43.189> least<00:02:43.370> the

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
the same sound pitch or at least the

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.360 
the same sound pitch or at least the
loudness<00:02:44.450> of<00:02:44.629> it<00:02:44.810> on<00:02:44.959> both<00:02:45.739> sides<00:02:46.040> of<00:02:46.280> your

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
loudness of it on both sides of your

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.729 
loudness of it on both sides of your
head<00:02:46.609> when<00:02:47.000> you<00:02:47.120> when<00:02:47.690> you<00:02:47.780> do<00:02:47.959> this<00:02:48.200> you're

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
head when you when you do this you're

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.890 
head when you when you do this you're
essentially<00:02:49.280> creating<00:02:49.310> a<00:02:49.849> dual<00:02:50.150> hemisphere

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
essentially creating a dual hemisphere

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.569 
essentially creating a dual hemisphere
consciousness<00:02:51.530> it's<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:51.769> first<00:02:52.040> time<00:02:52.340> you've

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
consciousness it's the first time you've

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:54.970 
consciousness it's the first time you've
turned<00:02:52.909> on<00:02:53.120> your<00:02:53.840> other<00:02:54.049> hemisphere<00:02:54.319> from<00:02:54.859> the

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
turned on your other hemisphere from the

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.270 
turned on your other hemisphere from the
one<00:02:55.129> you're<00:02:55.310> using<00:02:55.720> this<00:02:56.720> in<00:02:56.930> turn<00:02:57.280> will

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
one you're using this in turn will

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.520 
one you're using this in turn will
combine<00:02:58.730> them<00:02:59.030> slowly<00:02:59.420> and<00:02:59.780> it<00:02:59.989> sounds<00:03:00.409> like

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
combine them slowly and it sounds like

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.410 
combine them slowly and it sounds like
that<00:03:00.769> at<00:03:01.159> some<00:03:01.489> point<00:03:01.790> that<00:03:01.909> is<00:03:02.060> right<00:03:02.239> in<00:03:02.359> the

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
that at some point that is right in the

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.199 
that at some point that is right in the
middle<00:03:02.450> of<00:03:02.840> your<00:03:03.349> mind<00:03:03.680> inside<00:03:04.400> your<00:03:04.879> skull

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
middle of your mind inside your skull

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.509 
middle of your mind inside your skull
it's<00:03:05.540> a<00:03:05.629> very<00:03:05.840> beautiful<00:03:06.590> high-pitched

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
it's a very beautiful high-pitched

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.140 
it's a very beautiful high-pitched
frequency<00:03:07.730> that<00:03:08.239> stays<00:03:08.480> very<00:03:08.750> steady<00:03:09.139> now

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
frequency that stays very steady now

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.910 
frequency that stays very steady now
what<00:03:11.150> you<00:03:11.359> want<00:03:11.690> to<00:03:11.900> do<00:03:12.049> is<00:03:12.319> to<00:03:12.440> just<00:03:12.650> simply

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
what you want to do is to just simply

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.490 
what you want to do is to just simply
listen<00:03:13.579> to<00:03:13.730> it<00:03:13.849> concentrate<00:03:14.510> on<00:03:14.690> it<00:03:14.840> if<00:03:15.019> your

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
listen to it concentrate on it if your

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.650 
listen to it concentrate on it if your
mind<00:03:15.769> wanders<00:03:16.069> you'll<00:03:16.819> find<00:03:17.090> that<00:03:17.180> they<00:03:17.299> split

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
mind wanders you'll find that they split

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.569 
mind wanders you'll find that they split
apart<00:03:17.720> again<00:03:18.290> and<00:03:18.500> that<00:03:18.859> the<00:03:18.949> weaker<00:03:19.250> one<00:03:19.400> will

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
apart again and that the weaker one will

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.250 
apart again and that the weaker one will
fade<00:03:19.790> away<00:03:19.819> and<00:03:20.060> you<00:03:20.269> only<00:03:20.449> hear<00:03:20.750> the<00:03:20.840> one<00:03:21.049> and

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
fade away and you only hear the one and

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.619 
fade away and you only hear the one and
even<00:03:21.410> that<00:03:21.739> can<00:03:21.919> eventually<00:03:22.129> fade<00:03:22.579> away<00:03:22.849> so<00:03:23.090> if

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:23.629 
even that can eventually fade away so if

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:25.599 
even that can eventually fade away so if
your<00:03:23.750> mind<00:03:23.930> gets<00:03:23.989> distracted<00:03:24.500> it's<00:03:25.040> a<00:03:25.160> problem

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609 
your mind gets distracted it's a problem

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:27.879 
your mind gets distracted it's a problem
if<00:03:25.790> you<00:03:26.480> concentrate<00:03:27.230> on<00:03:27.410> it<00:03:27.560> and<00:03:27.709> you<00:03:27.769> can

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:27.889 
if you concentrate on it and you can

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:30.699 
if you concentrate on it and you can
bring<00:03:28.099> the<00:03:28.220> tones<00:03:28.519> together<00:03:29.150> the<00:03:30.079> longer<00:03:30.560> you

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
bring the tones together the longer you

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.189 
bring the tones together the longer you
hold<00:03:30.949> that<00:03:31.220> tone<00:03:31.459> together<00:03:31.819> the<00:03:32.209> deeper<00:03:32.720> your

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:33.199 
hold that tone together the deeper your

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:35.500 
hold that tone together the deeper your
concentration<00:03:33.859> will<00:03:34.190> become<00:03:34.549> the<00:03:35.090> deeper

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
concentration will become the deeper

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.170 
concentration will become the deeper
your<00:03:35.660> meditation<00:03:36.349> state<00:03:37.040> becomes<00:03:37.489> this
