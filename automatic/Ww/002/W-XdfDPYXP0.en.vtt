00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
role I like that I think what they're

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.789 
role I like that I think what they're
learning<00:02:42.760> that<00:02:43.390> you<00:02:44.049> didn't<00:02:44.349> have<00:02:44.500> in<00:02:44.650> high

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
learning that you didn't have in high

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.369 
learning that you didn't have in high
school<00:02:45.099> in<00:02:45.280> high<00:02:45.310> school<00:02:46.260> physically<00:02:47.260> they

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:47.379 
school in high school physically they

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.399 
school in high school physically they
could<00:02:47.530> either<00:02:47.650> overpower<00:02:48.190> someone<00:02:48.790> or<00:02:49.409> they

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:50.409 
could either overpower someone or they

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:51.809 
could either overpower someone or they
could<00:02:50.470> just<00:02:50.620> catch<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.099> ball<00:02:51.310> against<00:02:51.760> the

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
could just catch the ball against the

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.430 
could just catch the ball against the
sixth<00:02:52.120> floor<00:02:52.209> guy<00:02:52.450> and<00:02:52.629> turn<00:02:52.810> jump<00:02:53.139> up<00:02:53.260> and

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
sixth floor guy and turn jump up and

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.410 
sixth floor guy and turn jump up and
dump<00:02:53.620> it<00:02:53.769> and<00:02:54.010> I<00:02:54.849> think<00:02:55.239> it's<00:02:55.329> a<00:02:55.389> great

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
dump it and I think it's a great

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.970 
dump it and I think it's a great
learning<00:02:55.780> experience<00:02:55.989> for<00:02:56.379> them<00:02:56.590> to<00:02:56.620> have<00:02:56.829> to

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
learning experience for them to have to

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.490 
learning experience for them to have to
now<00:02:57.159> go<00:02:57.430> through<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:58.510> guy<00:02:58.659> behind<00:02:58.870> you<00:02:59.290> is<00:02:59.470> a

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
now go through the guy behind you is a

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.780 
now go through the guy behind you is a
lot<00:02:59.769> like<00:03:00.099> you<00:03:00.310> and<00:03:00.639> so<00:03:01.859> it'll<00:03:02.859> littell<00:03:03.190> it

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
lot like you and so it'll littell it

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.699 
lot like you and so it'll littell it
will<00:03:03.909> encourage<00:03:04.180> them<00:03:04.540> to<00:03:04.569> be<00:03:04.810> more<00:03:04.840> crafty<00:03:05.470> in

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
will encourage them to be more crafty in

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.530 
will encourage them to be more crafty in
what<00:03:05.950> they're<00:03:06.069> doing<00:03:06.310> which<00:03:06.519> is<00:03:06.549> I<00:03:06.909> think<00:03:07.150> that

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
what they're doing which is I think that

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.590 
what they're doing which is I think that
would<00:03:07.659> be<00:03:07.780> nothing<00:03:07.959> but<00:03:08.170> a<00:03:08.230> good<00:03:08.409> thing
