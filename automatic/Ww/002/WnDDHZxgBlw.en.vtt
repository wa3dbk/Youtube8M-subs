00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:09.269
 Hello girls 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.040
 I brought a makeup today that I think 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.290
 What are you going to love? 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.410
 it's the very simple eye to do it is 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:20.460
 super- faded law only brown and one 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.350
 little black to is dark to yield 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.779
 lower oxygen 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.539
 so it's very simple even just this 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.390
 plus one plus one machine is beautiful and 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:34.649
 highlight of the make is the lips I used one 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.510
 orange tone is with red background and 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.750
 a sparkling to golden 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.890
 I did not find any button that was 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:47.760
 It was like this tone and what I used was 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:51.329
 a pencil pencil from here I have 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.840
 lion is a long time. 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.600
 collection of them so they have got 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.370
 this lapse there and even here that 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.410
 I did not find any button that was 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.559
 I like this tone so I chose 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.240
 use pencils and look super cute 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.820
 I loved the result was one side 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.110
 and how to feel them boyfriend I 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.880
 I thought it was beautiful. 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.100
 I hope not step by step you 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.650
 can see the actual color of this button 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.990
 said button beat pencil because 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.119
 It really is beautiful and highlights are the 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.460
 products that I know I leave everything there in 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.490
 blog and I'll show you that I 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:31.380
 I used it on the skin and I used this 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:34.829
 Lauder staff is 3 6 3 and 2 and I 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.540
 I mixed with them and 42 from Amac 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.119
 I always make a mix that gives 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.729
 right to me that any of you 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.250
 decided to recreate this makeup put 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.770
 a photo is blank to the daily hashtag 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.909
 I thought I'd love to receive these photos. 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.680
 my good girl 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.890
 so this is it girls I hope you guys 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.899
 like make and let's start then 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.930
 girls to start I'm going to use a 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.329
 trailer all over my eyelid both in the 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.689
 upper and lower and I'll start 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.729
 using a dark brown shade as well 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.590
 to the upper eyelashes 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.420
 I'm going to do it like it's a delineation. 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.580
 It's kind of gross because I want this 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.300
 get well marked 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.550
 and darker than the rest of the eyelid 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.920
 little by little I'm starting to climb 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.710
 for the concave and I'll mark it next 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.810
 the outside of the concave to leave this 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.540
 darker also now with brown 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.850
 little more open and sparkling and I will 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.010
 apply over dark brown and for 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.910
 my whole moving eyelid 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.080
 the concave more or less to start 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.330
 form a gradient 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.520
 I'm going to get a smoking brush and a 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.130
 transition brown shadow and I go 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.070
 mix everything up then I trade 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.560
 mixing and I'm pulling up and down 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.770
 it was even time to form that 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.890
 beautiful gradient with the kitten shape that 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:58.740
 I love it then until it disappears 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.910
 all marking of brown with beige pencil 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:04.620
 I'm going to lighten people 's eyebrows 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.890
 then applied well below the eyebrow 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:11.520
 and then in the inner corner of the eye 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:18.300
 spread with the brush brush 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:22.769
 mark the pencil and then apply a 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:25.019
 opaque beige shadow over the pencil to 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:28.410
 soften that blurry that I just 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:31.670
 To do that I come back with a smoking brush . 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:35.790
 sujinho and I 'll be back more if it fits 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:38.100
 pulling out shade and to give a 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.070
 bit of color in the concave I'll use a 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.620
 tan opaque powder and I'll apply a 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:46.440
 little quantities smoke again 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.980
 Now I'm going to get a black kajal pencil and 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:53.670
 it will darken again close to the eyelashes 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:56.580
 and I will act as if I were a 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:00.480
 outlined again as ace pencil he is 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:02.160
 very creamy or applied little by little and 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.730
 I'm doing the same thing I did with 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.890
 the shade or applying close to the eyelashes 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.230
 forming as if it were a delineated with 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.660
 the bevelled brush I'll send 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.989
 has been outlined to give a legal form 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.640
 in this dark 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:20.090
 now with the pencil brush I come back with 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:23.389
 a dark brown shadow 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:27.199
 and apply over the pencil smoking and 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:29.870
 leaving this part well black and for 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:32.600
 soften that black I'll be back with 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.660
 transition brown shadow and apply for 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.850
 every eyelid fading 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.270
 that way the eye will go dark 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:43.850
 smudged at the same time 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:48.160
 Now I'm going to get a black kajal pencil and 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.160
 applied in the water line and also 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:54.139
 and with the same shadow of transition and wiis 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:58.190
 I smoke that lapse that I just applied 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:05:00.950
 to give a more beautiful finish 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.720
 now I apply false eyelashes if you 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:06.320
 You want to skip this part, no problem. 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:15.979
 You can use a rather mask mask that 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:19.039
 It will look great just like the 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:22.250
 bevelled brush I'll get a shade 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:26.450
 dark brown and I'll apply 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:30.080
 lower eyelashes and with the same 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:31.280
 brush pencil pencil I listen to everything and pull 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.680
 out 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.500
 are you doing that that kitty shape? 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.389
 that I like 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:41.570
 to light the inner corner I go 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:44.479
 to use a shadow is very bright gold 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:46.870
 so I apply and then I went outside 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:46.870
 also 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.539
 review the line of false eyelashes 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.870
 the same dark shadow and a brush 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:59.479
 beveled and apply enough mask 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.930
 both the upper lashes as 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:01.930
 lower eyelashes 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:18.340
 How blush I'm going to use a tanning powder 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.740
 from the apple half out 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:24.639
 I like being done I think it leaves 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:27.550
 well marked and very beautiful and to illuminate 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:30.639
 this part of the face I'll use a 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:32.919
 bronze also with a lot of sparkle 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:36.460
 I'll apply with the very cute brush 

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:39.240
 to let the whole area is lit 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:41.860
 on my lips I'll apply a primer 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.870
 apply a drop of the first and then 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:47.139
 the spread with your fingers 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:49.690
 this works with concealer as well and 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:51.790
 Today I'm going to use this pencil from here. 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:53.020
 Beautiful orange with a sparkling a 

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:55.690
 Golden 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:59.490
 then the first frame the shape of the 

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.490
 lips and then I fill in everything 

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:10.690
 I thought it was beautiful, I 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:13.570
