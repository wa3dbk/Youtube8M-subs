00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
went full speed which is full speed with

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.899 
went full speed which is full speed with
this<00:01:06.720> thing<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.110> prob<00:01:07.260> around<00:01:07.409> 40<00:01:07.909> straight

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
this thing is prob around 40 straight

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.260 
this thing is prob around 40 straight
into<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.299> curb<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.670> probably<00:01:11.670> int<00:01:11.880> with<00:01:12.060> one

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
into a curb and probably int with one

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.850 
into a curb and probably int with one
tire<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.750> you'd<00:01:13.200> probably<00:01:13.320> think<00:01:13.530> like<00:01:13.740> an

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
tire and you'd probably think like an

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.039 
tire and you'd probably think like an
animal<00:01:14.189> break<00:01:14.400> but<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.119> actually<00:01:15.299> broke<00:01:15.750> an

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
animal break but I actually broke an

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.179 
animal break but I actually broke an
aluminum<00:01:17.040> hub<00:01:17.610> carrier<00:01:18.140> which<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.320> insane

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
aluminum hub carrier which is insane

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.770 
aluminum hub carrier which is insane
because<00:01:20.430> i<00:01:20.610> thought<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.000> plastic<00:01:21.630> would

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
because i thought the plastic would

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.550 
because i thought the plastic would
break<00:01:22.020> but<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.350> aluminum<00:01:22.830> broke<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:24.560> this

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
break but the aluminum broke so this

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.070 
break but the aluminum broke so this
thing<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.770> super<00:01:26.130> durable<00:01:26.430> I've<00:01:26.850> got<00:01:27.750> upgraded

got a traxxas link controller for a

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.900 
got a traxxas link controller for a
receiver<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:10.110> I<00:03:10.950> use<00:03:11.130> the<00:03:11.310> traxxas<00:03:11.730> link

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
receiver and I use the traxxas link

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.600 
receiver and I use the traxxas link
controller<00:03:12.860> just<00:03:13.860> because<00:03:14.100> I<00:03:14.220> don't<00:03:14.370> want<00:03:14.400> to

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610

servo<00:03:21.450> I'm<00:03:22.350> probably<00:03:22.470> gonna<00:03:22.709> switch<00:03:22.920> it<00:03:22.950> out

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
servo I'm probably gonna switch it out

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.710 
servo I'm probably gonna switch it out
because<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.459> servo<00:03:23.820> super<00:03:24.180> weak<00:03:24.329> for<00:03:24.600> these

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
because the servo super weak for these

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.449

via the hpi turpin trip Turing pin and
these<00:03:41.640> are<00:03:41.850> insane<00:03:42.420> when<00:03:42.810> I<00:03:42.840> put<00:03:43.049> these<00:03:43.170> tires

on it I do backflips on command I do
wheelies<00:03:46.850> standing<00:03:47.850> back<00:03:48.030> flips<00:03:48.380> but<00:03:49.380> those

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
wheelies standing back flips but those

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
take these tires off of these rims I'm

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.039 
take these tires off of these rims I'm
gonna<00:04:06.810> mount<00:04:07.380> them<00:04:07.590> on<00:04:07.709> some<00:04:07.950> rims<00:04:08.130> like<00:04:08.310> these

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
gonna mount them on some rims like these

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:13.039 
gonna mount them on some rims like these
so<00:04:10.049> I<00:04:10.079> have<00:04:10.290> a<00:04:10.320> bigger<00:04:10.530> hex<00:04:10.799> and<00:04:11.100> then<00:04:12.060> I'll<00:04:12.510> be

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
so I have a bigger hex and then I'll be

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:14.780 
so I have a bigger hex and then I'll be
able<00:04:13.079> to<00:04:13.200> use<00:04:13.320> these<00:04:13.470> for<00:04:13.650> bashing<00:04:13.799> again<00:04:14.130> but

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
able to use these for bashing again but

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.849 
able to use these for bashing again but
these<00:04:14.940> tires<00:04:15.180> come<00:04:15.600> stock<00:04:16.019> on<00:04:16.200> the<00:04:16.229> savage

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
these tires come stock on the savage

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:22.279 
these tires come stock on the savage
flux<00:04:17.039> savage<00:04:17.959> XL<00:04:18.959> the<00:04:19.320> nitro<00:04:20.190> one<00:04:20.840> so<00:04:21.840> and

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
driving it with all these upgrades I a

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:02.410 
driving it with all these upgrades I a
drill<00:04:57.090> I<00:04:57.270> broke<00:04:57.510> the<00:04:58.400> rear<00:05:00.440> diff<00:05:01.440> holder<00:05:02.010> I

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
broke this but that's after excessive

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.590 
broke this but that's after excessive
use<00:05:07.340> so<00:05:08.340> I<00:05:08.670> don't<00:05:08.910> think<00:05:09.030> it's<00:05:09.150> going<00:05:09.360> to<00:05:09.420> break

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
use so I don't think it's going to break

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
any more I landed like when I broke it I

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.420 
any more I landed like when I broke it I
landed<00:05:12.870> on<00:05:12.900> the<00:05:13.020> rear<00:05:13.170> tires<00:05:13.380> like<00:05:14.070> with<00:05:14.250> full

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
landed on the rear tires like with full

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.950 
landed on the rear tires like with full
power<00:05:14.670> pretty<00:05:15.180> much<00:05:15.300> to<00:05:15.420> the<00:05:15.510> wheels<00:05:15.690> and

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
power pretty much to the wheels and

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.180 
power pretty much to the wheels and
that's<00:05:16.620> what<00:05:17.100> made<00:05:17.220> it<00:05:17.250> break<00:05:17.780> so<00:05:18.950> and<00:05:19.950> I've

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
that's what made it break so and I've

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.950 
that's what made it break so and I've
landed<00:05:20.400> like<00:05:20.610> that<00:05:20.669> couple<00:05:21.630> other<00:05:21.750> times

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
landed like that couple other times

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.020 
landed like that couple other times
after<00:05:22.230> I<00:05:22.260> replaced<00:05:22.680> it<00:05:22.830> and<00:05:23.010> hasn't<00:05:23.640> broken<00:05:23.820> so

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
after I replaced it and hasn't broken so

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.670 
after I replaced it and hasn't broken so
I<00:05:24.060> think<00:05:24.180> I<00:05:24.450> don't<00:05:24.960> have<00:05:25.050> to<00:05:25.169> deal<00:05:25.470> with<00:05:25.530> that

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680
