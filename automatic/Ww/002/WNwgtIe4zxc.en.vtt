00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.019 
the shock sensor and the twin sensor to
the<00:00:24.420> factory<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:24.990> want<00:00:25.220> so<00:00:26.220> basically<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:26.760> lock

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
the factory I want so basically you lock

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.460 
the factory I want so basically you lock
it<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.330> same<00:00:27.510> way<00:00:27.660> you've<00:00:27.930> been<00:00:28.080> doing<00:00:28.380> it

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
it the same way you've been doing it

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.679 
it the same way you've been doing it
what<00:00:29.400> happens<00:00:29.730> when<00:00:29.880> Mercedes<00:00:30.390> they<00:00:30.510> don't

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
what happens when Mercedes they don't

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.110 
what happens when Mercedes they don't
really<00:00:30.840> put<00:00:31.170> any<00:00:31.320> type<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.850> impact<00:00:32.850> sensors

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
really put any type of impact sensors

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.569 
really put any type of impact sensors
for<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.870> tires<00:00:34.110> or<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.649> glass<00:00:34.920> because<00:00:35.430> they

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
for the tires or the glass because they

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:36.680 
for the tires or the glass because they
don't<00:00:35.730> want<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.000> deal<00:00:36.180> with<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.480> false

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
don't want to deal with the false

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.190 
don't want to deal with the false
triggering<00:00:36.960> if<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.430> mean<00:00:39.030> they<00:00:39.480> just<00:00:39.510> go

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
triggering if so I mean they just go

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.930 
triggering if so I mean they just go
ahead<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.500> stick<00:00:40.710> their<00:00:40.890> factory<00:00:41.399> alarm<00:00:41.700> the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
ahead and stick their factory alarm the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.790 
ahead and stick their factory alarm the
way<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.450> works<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:42.960> open<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.379> door<00:00:43.559> it

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
way it works is that you open a door it

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.740 
way it works is that you open a door it
fires<00:00:44.010> off<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.430> alarm<00:00:44.700> but<00:00:45.300> other<00:00:45.450> than<00:00:45.660> that

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
fires off the alarm but other than that

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.410 
fires off the alarm but other than that
you<00:00:46.590> can<00:00:46.620> break<00:00:47.010> all<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.280> windows<00:00:47.420> vandalize

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
you can break all the windows vandalize

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.690 
you can break all the windows vandalize
the<00:00:48.450> whole<00:00:48.750> car<00:00:49.070> leave<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.190> car<00:00:50.370> full<00:00:50.610> of

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
the whole car leave the car full of

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.119 
the whole car leave the car full of
bricks<00:00:51.530> basically<00:00:52.530> nothing<00:00:52.860> will<00:00:52.949> happen

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
bricks basically nothing will happen

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.819 
bricks basically nothing will happen
unless<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:54.090> open<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.570> door<00:00:54.719> so<00:00:55.320> we<00:00:55.559> went<00:00:55.739> ahead

unless you open a door so we went ahead

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.170 
unless you open a door so we went ahead
and<00:00:56.070> added<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.430> sensor<00:00:56.789> I'm<00:00:56.910> going<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.090> go

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
and added the sensor I'm going to go

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.520 
and added the sensor I'm going to go
ahead<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.420> trigger<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.809> show<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.109> guys<00:00:58.350> how

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
here because I will help out if people

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.949 
here because I will help out if people
are<00:01:25.770> driving<00:01:26.039> by<00:01:26.280> these<00:01:27.090> apartment<00:01:27.600> complex

00:01:27.949 --> 00:01:27.959 
are driving by these apartment complex

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:30.169 
are driving by these apartment complex
lately<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.500> breaking<00:01:28.860> into<00:01:29.009> 50<00:01:29.549> or<00:01:29.610> 60<00:01:29.939> cars

00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:30.179 
lately and breaking into 50 or 60 cars

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:31.669 
lately and breaking into 50 or 60 cars
and<00:01:30.450> then<00:01:30.569> I<00:01:30.659> guess<00:01:30.869> what<00:01:31.079> they<00:01:31.200> do<00:01:31.259> if<00:01:31.530> they

00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:31.679 
and then I guess what they do if they

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:33.709 
and then I guess what they do if they
don't<00:01:31.860> see<00:01:31.950> an<00:01:32.069> alarm<00:01:32.390> stickers<00:01:33.390> though<00:01:33.600> they

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:33.719 
don't see an alarm stickers though they

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:35.389 
don't see an alarm stickers though they
don't<00:01:33.810> see<00:01:34.020> any<00:01:34.170> type<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.560> lighting<00:01:34.799> or<00:01:35.219> they

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
don't see any type of lighting or they

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:37.340 
don't see any type of lighting or they
just<00:01:35.640> maybe<00:01:35.850> go<00:01:36.090> bang<00:01:36.360> on<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.630> real<00:01:36.810> lightly<00:01:37.079> to

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
just maybe go bang on it real lightly to

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.499 
just maybe go bang on it real lightly to
see<00:01:37.500> if<00:01:37.590> anything<00:01:37.950> happens<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.490> so<00:01:39.209> go

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
see if anything happens to it so go

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.270 
see if anything happens to it so go
ahead<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.750> if<00:01:40.140> any<00:01:40.349> any<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:40.920> those<00:01:41.009> three

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
ahead and if any any of those three

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.469 
ahead and if any any of those three
things<00:01:41.459> are<00:01:41.610> not<00:01:41.759> happening<00:01:41.970> they'll<00:01:42.360> go

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
things are not happening they'll go
