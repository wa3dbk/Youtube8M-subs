00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.559 
all this was just the other lens so i'm
going<00:02:11.130> to<00:02:11.220> show<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.670> first<00:02:11.970> length<00:02:12.330> which

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
going to show you the first length which

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.530 
going to show you the first length which
is<00:02:12.600> the<00:02:12.990> one<00:02:13.319> inch<00:02:13.620> which<00:02:14.400> is<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:15.120> one<00:02:15.390> that's

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
is the one inch which is the one that's

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.390 
is the one inch which is the one that's
mostly<00:02:15.989> in<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.349> back

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
mostly in the back

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.589 
mostly in the back
so<00:02:19.400> there<00:02:19.670> you<00:02:19.700> go<00:02:21.670> then<00:02:22.670> this<00:02:22.909> is<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.120> tool

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
so there you go then this is the tool

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.190 
so there you go then this is the tool
inch<00:02:23.900> and<00:02:24.670> yes<00:02:25.670> it<00:02:25.969> does<00:02:26.239> come<00:02:26.510> free<00:02:26.749> but<00:02:26.959> like

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
inch and yes it does come free but like

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.309 
inch and yes it does come free but like
all<00:02:27.379> 27<00:02:27.980> piece<00:02:28.159> here<00:02:28.430> and<00:02:28.840> the<00:02:29.840> tracks<00:02:30.170> are

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
all 27 piece here and the tracks are

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.599 
all 27 piece here and the tracks are
very<00:02:30.379> thin<00:02:32.950> just<00:02:33.950> so<00:02:34.129> you<00:02:34.189> can<00:02:34.370> get<00:02:34.549> that

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:34.609 
very thin just so you can get that

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:37.740 
very thin just so you can get that
realistic<00:02:35.269> effect<00:02:35.870> then<00:02:36.469> this<00:02:36.769> was<00:02:37.189> the

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
realistic effect then this was the

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:45.520 
realistic effect then this was the
three-inch<00:02:38.750> as<00:02:39.709> you<00:02:39.950> can<00:02:40.159> see<00:02:41.319> so<00:02:44.200> I<00:02:45.200> basically

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
three-inch as you can see so I basically

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.470 
three-inch as you can see so I basically
did<00:02:46.159> like<00:02:46.879> I<00:02:47.000> said<00:02:47.060> I<00:02:47.209> follow<00:02:47.510> her<00:02:47.689> tutorial<00:02:49.480> it

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
did like I said I follow her tutorial it

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.259 
did like I said I follow her tutorial it

this<00:02:53.359> is<00:02:53.540> 2<00:02:53.810> inch<00:02:54.049> right<00:02:54.260> here<00:02:54.590> and<00:02:54.829> then<00:02:55.579> i

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:55.609 
this is 2 inch right here and then i

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:57.280 
this is 2 inch right here and then i
have<00:02:55.700> a<00:02:55.849> lot<00:02:56.060> of<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.419> one<00:02:56.629> inch<00:02:56.780> in<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:56.989> back

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
have a lot of the one inch in the back

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.140 
have a lot of the one inch in the back
right<00:02:58.159> now<00:02:58.219> i<00:02:58.849> don't<00:02:58.909> know<00:02:59.209> i'm<00:02:59.299> still<00:02:59.510> kind<00:02:59.810> of

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
right now i don't know i'm still kind of

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.399 
right now i don't know i'm still kind of
trying<00:03:02.150> to<00:03:02.329> figure<00:03:02.599> it<00:03:02.629> out<00:03:02.780> i<00:03:02.840> think<00:03:03.079> i<00:03:03.199> want

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:03.409 
trying to figure it out i think i want

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:04.929 
trying to figure it out i think i want
to<00:03:03.500> cut<00:03:03.680> it<00:03:03.769> up<00:03:03.889> some<00:03:04.129> more<00:03:04.159> because<00:03:04.459> it's<00:03:04.760> not

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:04.939 
to cut it up some more because it's not

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:06.839 
to cut it up some more because it's not
layered<00:03:05.239> as<00:03:05.569> much<00:03:05.780> as<00:03:05.930> I<00:03:06.049> thought<00:03:06.230> it<00:03:06.379> would<00:03:06.409> be

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
layered as much as I thought it would be

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.250 
layered as much as I thought it would be
naturally<00:03:07.849> so<00:03:08.090> I<00:03:08.120> guess<00:03:08.419> I<00:03:08.540> got<00:03:08.689> to<00:03:08.719> go<00:03:08.870> back<00:03:09.049> in

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
naturally so I guess I got to go back in

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.209 
naturally so I guess I got to go back in
fix<00:03:09.980> a<00:03:10.189> few<00:03:10.400> things<00:03:10.430> with<00:03:10.819> that<00:03:11.060> and<00:03:12.219> other

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:13.219 
fix a few things with that and other

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:17.379 
fix a few things with that and other
than<00:03:13.430> that<00:03:14.620> this<00:03:15.620> is<00:03:15.799> my<00:03:16.150> oldest<00:03:17.150> in<00:03:17.239> me

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389
