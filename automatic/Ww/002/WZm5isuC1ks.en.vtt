00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
head-to-head and i was trying to match

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.990 
head-to-head and i was trying to match
them<00:01:04.470> with<00:01:04.680> those<00:01:05.159> combining<00:01:05.850> them<00:01:05.970> with

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
them with those combining them with

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.179 
them with those combining them with
southern<00:01:06.510> stats<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.320> he<00:01:07.500> used<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.799> have<00:01:07.979> on

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
southern stats that he used to have on

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.740 
southern stats that he used to have on
fifa<00:01:08.729> 12<00:01:08.939> so<00:01:09.090> it's<00:01:09.180> kind<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.450> mixture

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
fifa 12 so it's kind of a mixture

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.320 
fifa 12 so it's kind of a mixture
between<00:01:09.890> head-to-head<00:01:10.890> stats<00:01:11.159> now<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.850> what

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
between head-to-head stats now and what

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.060 
between head-to-head stats now and what
he<00:01:12.360> used<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.750> have<00:01:12.930> in<00:01:13.170> fifa<00:01:13.530> 12<00:01:13.740> because<00:01:13.950> i

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
he used to have in fifa 12 because i

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.280 
he used to have in fifa 12 because i
think<00:01:14.130> there's<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.460> big<00:01:14.820> big<00:01:15.090> difference<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.960> I

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
think there's a big big difference and I

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.160 
think there's a big big difference and I
think<00:01:16.590> 83<00:01:17.490> rated<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.150> pretty<00:01:18.630> fair

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
think 83 rated is a pretty fair

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.740 
think 83 rated is a pretty fair
estimation<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.950> how<00:01:20.040> he's<00:01:20.729> going<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.030> do<00:01:21.240> for

head-to-head and he's gonna be a bit

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.950 
head-to-head and he's gonna be a bit
slower<00:02:04.469> he<00:02:04.860> was<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.130> lot<00:02:05.549> faster<00:02:06.000> mp4<00:02:06.450> 12<00:02:06.659> on

fifa 12 he was 72 rated he had 59 pace

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.199 
fifa 12 he was 72 rated he had 59 pace
as<00:02:10.950> well<00:02:11.190> but<00:02:11.340> overall<00:02:11.640> i'm<00:02:11.819> gonna<00:02:11.970> give<00:02:12.120> her<00:02:12.180> a

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
as well but overall i'm gonna give her a

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.730 
as well but overall i'm gonna give her a
bit<00:02:12.390> of<00:02:12.540> a<00:02:12.629> downgrade<00:02:12.840> he<00:02:13.410> has

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
been playing in the a-league and I think

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.930 
been playing in the a-league and I think
these<00:02:16.200> are<00:02:16.260> some<00:02:16.710> of<00:02:16.740> the<00:02:16.800> stats<00:02:17.040> that<00:02:17.250> reflect

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.060 
head-to-head that's what he's got I'm
not<00:02:24.780> sure<00:02:24.930> if<00:02:25.020> they'll<00:02:25.170> bring<00:02:25.710> that<00:02:25.920> over

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
not sure if they'll bring that over

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.950 
not sure if they'll bring that over
straight<00:02:26.460> tortoise<00:02:26.820> too<00:02:27.000> because<00:02:27.360> Lolo

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
straight tortoise too because Lolo

players aren't a big fan favorite on
alta<00:02:30.810> team<00:02:31.020> and<00:02:31.410> i'm<00:02:31.590> intrigued<00:02:31.980> to<00:02:32.070> see<00:02:32.130> if

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
alta team and i'm intrigued to see if

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.770 
alta team and i'm intrigued to see if
they<00:02:32.520> actually<00:02:32.550> bring<00:02:33.000> that<00:02:33.120> over<00:02:33.240> i<00:02:33.390> think

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
they actually bring that over i think

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.050 
they actually bring that over i think
they<00:02:33.930> might<00:02:34.290> but<00:02:35.100> most<00:02:35.430> of<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.670> time<00:02:35.850> they

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
they might but most of the time they

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.300 
they might but most of the time they
don't<00:02:36.090> so<00:02:36.450> that<00:02:36.480> may<00:02:36.840> change<00:02:37.170> now<00:02:37.800> if<00:02:38.070> there

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
don't so that may change now if there

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.430 
don't so that may change now if there
