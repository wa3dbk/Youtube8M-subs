 what if you donâ€™t 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.840
 share with selected rim video magazine 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.300
 He speaks 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.940
 because surely you do not know that from the very 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.970
 The rims depend and the functionality of your 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.090
 points if the frame is chosen wrong then 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.560
 even the most expensive lenses will not help you 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.150
 so you do the right thing 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.040
 choice turn to our 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:34.440
 experts for advice how is it right 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:36.810
 choose a frame if you need 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.570
 reading glasses think about what 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.710
 field of view you need exists 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.930
 lecture frames 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.420
 or halves which allows not 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.640
 taking off points look at medium and 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.200
 long distance case if you 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.420
 accustomed to big points 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.180
 or want office glasses in them 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.490
 combined zone for near and computer 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.070
 working distance up to one and a half meters 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.360
 your choice of large rims not cutting off 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.300
 field of view below 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.009
 have a certain angle if you 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.380
 need progressive glasses then 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:09.869
 not recommended round frames 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.299
 narrow and if you are just starting to wear 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.579
 progressive glasses are big enough 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.140
 rounding the lower rim of the frame 

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:19.020
 allow you to minimize 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.429
 lateral distortion zones are sufficient 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.009
 large rim size 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:25.619
 reduce the habituation time for points for 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.929
 further choose frame completely 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.020
 covering the field you need 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:33.810
 view if the frame is convenient for me now is the 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.030
 no need to think that they can fix it 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.369
 the maximum that can be changed 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.639
 straighten the nose pads and one at a time 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:46.139
 pictures pay attention to the distance 

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:48.840
 from eyes to glen rim for distance should 

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:51.119
 sit tight if you're used to big a 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.730
 right then getting used to the glasses starting 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.650
 right 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.860
 give you a lot of unpleasant moments 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:59.380
 if you choose by the spatula and or without 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.480
 rim you back and forth to cost rate 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.700
 individuals can grow significantly 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:07.090
 I will rim and rim required 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.640
 certain thickness around the edges if you have 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.770
 plus lenses and then most likely them 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.380
 have made individually and 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.570
 it is always an extra expense points 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.030
 on screws without a horseshoe and on the right very 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.670
 fragile and therefore lenses are inserted into them 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.070
 from special materials polycarbonate 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.410
 a drowner that always increases the cost 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.470
 orders but worth saying that people 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.580
 wearing these glasses with them seconds and no pity 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.830
 about your choice 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.070
 since these materials are very light and 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.260
 durable if you want to insert lenses by 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.990
 right droop of sunglasses or 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.210
 having a certain bend keep in mind 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.700
 that ordinary lenses put there 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:48.370
 impossible for this developed 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.400
 special sports lenses and which 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.810
 made individually 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.760
 respectively, the time of manufacture of data 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.760
 points and their value increases 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.310
 separately I want to highlight the rim for 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.370
 children's glasses 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.670
 in no case choose frame 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:12.310
 having measured it on the child the frame should be 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.800
 light strong and well-sized head 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.880
 of the preliminary alignment of the rim 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.340
 necessarily 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.930
 then your child can tell you 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.140
 it is comfortable to him 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:26.080
 or not keep in mind that not a single optics 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.940
 in the children's glasses in me put glass 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.090
 lenses even your imperative 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.920
 request as they are extremely 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.350
 traumatic and finally several 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.120
 general rules 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.700
 please pay attention to the length 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.660
 married by anyone if he is short 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.940
 then you will be uncomfortable and if it is long 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.950
 the points will move down even if the temples 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.510
 to be bent 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.900
 if you prefer mineral 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.570
 glass lenses keep in mind that weight 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.480
 finished points will be much different 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:01.870
 from the weight just rim glasses will be heavier 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.760
 for a clearer landing points choose 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.920
 frame without compensator 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.580
 hostage if you have enough 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.050
 thick lenses at the edges choose frame 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:15.319
 with the thickness of the hammer 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:17.930
 then the glasses will look more aesthetic 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:20.600
 do not choose a frame intercenter 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.880
 the distance which is more your more 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.820
 than 10 millimeters desirable 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.020
 choose a rim with a prescription for 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:32.000
 Glasses and consult with a consultant 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.070
 choose the frame correctly and you do not 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.240
 There will be problems with the manufacture of glasses 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:40.400
 in no cabin in the middle of the 19th 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.320
 century with the choice of frames there were no problems 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.419
 Viktor then glasses were attached to the nose 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.669
 strut so -called pince - nez 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:49.280
 now among the vast choice 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:51.680
 different frames is important not to be mistaken and 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.870
 make this super right hope

 what our expert advice to you about it 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:05:00.080
