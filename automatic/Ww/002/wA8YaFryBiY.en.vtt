00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:07.209
 good afternoon with you roots we continue 

00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:09.970
 build our city on the islands between 

00:00:07.209 --> 00:00:13.000
 recording between this recording 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:16.749
 last a little bit of time passed 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.029
 time late school stopping power but 

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:21.640
 in my opinion it did not give any effect 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.079
 there is a profit per hour it did not affect then 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.470
 there was no need to spend on it 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:28.869
 time, besides, I flowed a little 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.749
 bus stop public 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:35.079
 transport is not some also closed 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:37.649
 some new set in principle 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.859
 nothing I really did that me 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.350
 confuses 

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:46.470
 I am very confused by this 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:49.320
 look i donâ€™t really understand that 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.540
 that means that's what it means to 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.820
 industrial goods total orders 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.850
 replacing all the orders they are all not 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.980
 fulfilled is what it means if you know 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.190
 What do these orders mean ? 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.780
 please i guess i have 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.710
 the problem is i don't have 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:12.080
 there is no warehouse I usually freight that is me 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:17.049
 no plants and I thought he might be 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.049
 it does not need let's try to put 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.890
 try to put the warehouse by the way 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.850
 look me here new dancing house 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.490
 appeared 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.640
 how do you remember that my failed in 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.370
 the city 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.370
 Homik also answer this house jumps 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.799
 generally buggy him there of course drink 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.430
 it is funny but he also did what 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.900
 we will deliver now 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.980
 stock 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.980
 for regular goods 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.840
 and in addition there are very few cars at 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:54.500
 our warehouse is overflowing 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.090
 it's not good let's add to it 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.670
 that's the maximum kind of machines 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.679
 I hope now he will sell because 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.110
 her just 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:08.810
 storage 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:10.670
 storage of alloys is full I don't know 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.010
 need here is the alignment for ordinary goods 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.720
 at the word that there is no plant or no need 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.260
 let's watch some time for 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.599
 by him 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.650
 further that I still confuse me very 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:27.540
 confused ferry they are this 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:29.450
 complain that these ferries are full 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.909
 I know to be honest what to do 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.159
 because if you put another one next 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:36.810
 the ferry seems to me they will 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:37.490
 forces shop next 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.330
 she is 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:44.180
 the second will not pay attention not here 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.569
 interesting here you know I can not go 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.349
 on the ferry it is crowded 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:53.349
 I can take down the pier here 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:57.060
 for blood this breed is different 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:58.749
 ferryboat 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.790
 ferry pier 

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:02.950
 ferry port for transportation to 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.849
 middle and low income workers with 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.349
 other cities 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:11.130
 who have access to water and for 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:13.959
 cruise liners 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.540
 delivers high average tourists 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:20.349
 wealth from the region 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:22.209
 yeah that is chickens a cruise liner this is for 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:27.010
 high average I probably 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:30.940
 crowded for low 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:33.250
 crowded so not enough 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.940
 scientists take down that for cruise liners 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.580
 put 2 for 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.460
 well, ferry 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.930
 on let's do it then 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:46.840
 what else will I put 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.840
 I put it cheap if I put it 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.810
 so here and carried for cruise 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.840
 then I do not let the steam fast 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.330
 put a second password 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.620
 here you have to see the bastard then put 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.200
 on the second one 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.910
 still the second port and watch what it is 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.370
 done is over but it seems to me that 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.930
 they will move out the nearest he will 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.599
 crowded second will be idle 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.920
 so okay here we build rich 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:20.740
 district I here he set a 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:25.150
 carrot yet she is not very strong 

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:27.070
 profitable here u not bad so now 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:31.000
 let's deal with our tourism 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.320
 tourism is not something absolutely not happy so 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.380
 coffee lego towers 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.440
 well, not a bad general profit about visiting 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.940
 but the visit is generally not bad yes 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.520
 most low-level tourists 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.930
 even in rich appeared tourists called 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:50.040
 15 people believed they visited 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:52.980
 sights blowing mill 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:58.760
 35 thousand she earns more than and 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:05:01.320
 35000 Tower again in her children 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.540
 cook at me believe tourists with high 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.570
 income and we do not have casinos for them 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:10.160
 wrong here this casino we have very 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.160
 many lose it is unclear why 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:16.470
 it earns 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.470
 so she 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.070
 we principle he still has reserves 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:25.110
 to lead 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.110
 it earns casino 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.290
 mostly he so let's ka we 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.080
 launch event event 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:34.310

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:50.870
 Aircraft put as a note if 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:55.280
 put the plane the plane and in my 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:56.780
 there are planes in that city 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.889
 or not 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.889
 I already forgot about the coin 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:05.490
 let's see there were airplanes there 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:07.919
 and no at least that's built this large 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:11.099
 we have the most international construction 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:12.710
 the airport here is being built us airport 

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:15.270
 major airport 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.250
