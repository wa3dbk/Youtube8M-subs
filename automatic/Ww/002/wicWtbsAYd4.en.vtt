00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
the list not much has changed well

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.979 
the list not much has changed well
actually<00:00:49.850> a<00:00:50.030> pretty<00:00:50.270> good<00:00:50.390> bunch<00:00:50.570> has<00:00:52.840> it--<00:00:53.840> so

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
right it's a must get in the deck you

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.069 
right it's a must get in the deck you
need<00:00:59.090> three<00:00:59.390> can't<00:00:59.960> deal<00:01:00.170> with<00:01:00.200> out<00:01:01.809> while<00:01:02.809> can

this thing actually does get really
competitive<00:01:50.360> at<00:01:50.750> times<00:01:51.050> i'm<00:01:51.259> also<00:01:51.410> gonna<00:01:51.530> add

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
competitive at times i'm also gonna add

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.600 
competitive at times i'm also gonna add
that<00:01:52.039> and<00:01:53.349> it's<00:01:54.349> also<00:01:54.500> a<00:01:54.649> fun<00:01:54.890> play<00:01:55.069> back<00:01:55.280> in<00:01:55.459> my
