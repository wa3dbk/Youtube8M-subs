00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.119
 pirates it was really unbelievable 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.859
 a lot of work the mod ersteller 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.010
 to write down all the licenses too 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.109
 collect and do everything possible and 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.610
 Of course , really big and thick 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.960
 thank you very much for swimming at least that 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.640
 mod pack made possible in the first place 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.110
 had ever put together 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.600
 has been with the conflicts and 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.670
 some totally stupid ones 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.489
 to deal with random errors 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.840
 Thanks a lot and now it is 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.760
 finally as far as he finds the video below 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.500
 description a link step number 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.600
 One thing you have to do , of course 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.120
 the technology lounge download the 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.140
 pants court pack is also in technology 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.149
 launcher available 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.500
 Step two is definitely one 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.539
 a recommended step in the options 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.580
 the memory so under memory the 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.619
 used memory on 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.010
 to put at least two gigabytes so 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.260
 as a small help of two work should 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.610
 absolutely enough to play stable 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.159
 if you have more then you also like more 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.920
 I play with four to six gigabytes 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.750
 assigned 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.939
 Step number three left is one 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.920
 small banderole in the launcher where the 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.890
 different parks are in it and if 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.350
 you put on add pack and pack there 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.970
 then you have this platform euroline 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.540
 Give this platform years you will find 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.570
 on the main page on the on the 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.509
 technology side where the pants corp rottbeck 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.040
 has a side and there you will find this 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.380
 platform l'oréal you have to go in there 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.240
 copy then you can on ed wood pack 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.490
 Maybe you can still click that 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.509
 Customize folder 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.350
 you may see on the screenshot i 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.450
 have my folder for example 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.759
 adapted because with me drive c where that 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.729
 a standard is housed 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.670
 ssd is not necessarily me and the me 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.840
 ssd want to treat that's in 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.430
 principle already if you then play 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.960
 So click the pack of course if 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.910
 then click on play then he starts 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.170
 that can download a whole 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.270
 lasts long because the pack is not 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.040
 just small 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.540
 logically, the second third 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.980
 fourth time states there are, of course, 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.270
 he has that a little faster 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.550
 Download everything 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.960
 This pack is mainly made by 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.260
 Therefore, many were swimming again 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.070
 thanks 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.060
 of course also serviced and updated 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.290
 if we decide there must 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.600
 just get out a Rhine as 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.070
 biberbrugg barabara then you will find that 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.790
 on course on the side below 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.410
 changelog 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.870
 but you basically do not have to 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.950
 think about it because that will 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.520
 about the launcher then everything about you 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.810
 further apropos things communicate the 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.480
 do not work changelog and 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.030
 second on this page has swam in 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.290
 the description firstly his twitter 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.520
 account also links you 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.620
 where he could write about 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.650
 ask chor to follow him or better 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.970
 but also a bug tracker 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.440
 was actually so friendly has one 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.930
 bug tracker set up if something 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.640
 does not work there, please 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.640
 read the note well it is not 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.500
 if it just does not start when 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.330
 you have the wrong version of java installed 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.980
 have or something like that but it is 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.660
 For example, a bug if you have a one 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.700
 pipe connects to a machine and it 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.560
 does not behave as it should or 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.880
 crashes or no idea what if you 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:25.400
 then get an error message 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:28.220
 in fact then you can have one yes 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.480
 create report and already has times 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.520
 written to if not with 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.709
 any mod incompatibilities 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.240
 or so I have to do wrong 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.250
 I just trust you to know 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.730
 what a real mistake is and what or 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.860
 I've certainly done something wrong yes 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.480
 then you can use that is with 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.190
 safety of one or the other mistake too 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.820
 be there because we are currently playing 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:52.250
 to 5000 copies and three pirates 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.480
 tiemann with this pack and there is 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.070
 guaranteed things we still have 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.630
 not touched at all or at all 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.700
 not tried there you will find too 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.709
 the whole mod list it's nice to say 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.770
 to that we mpeg into force yet 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.870
 could keep diverse reason 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.830
 I do not want to get any closer now 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.910
 I'll think about that 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.840
 most of you are listening too 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.410
 not anymore but are already on 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.450

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.130
 I wish a lot of fun with the park 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.660
 if you have twitter then you can 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:18.770

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:20.630

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:24.320
