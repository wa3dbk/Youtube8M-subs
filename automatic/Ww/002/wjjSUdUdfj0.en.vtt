00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.150
 marcela welcome 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.039
 for today I 'm going to bring you another hairstyle 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.710
 quick and easy to do is one of the 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:20.919
 basic braids is known as the 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.619
 French braid inverted also the 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:26.259
 braid in relief or the Dutch braid 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.270
 has several good names to start 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:31.270
 then previously I applied in the 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.879
 hair will be to mold in this part 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.219
 of the head was especially for the 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:38.160
 frizz of this part of the head 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:41.350
 especially in girls who have 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.200
 very short hair on this side too 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.360
 we are going to need a loop to 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.880
 decorate the hairstyle 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:54.520
 maybe we need hooks to 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:58.920
 the hair at the end elastic bands 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:01.300
 hair spray and a comb 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.640
 we started then 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:08.290
 brushing back 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:10.960
 the hair combing it and we take a 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.710
 part of the hair from up here almost 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.710
 to the crown 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.490
 we combed 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.750
 and we divide it into three parts 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.270
 well let's have then that this is 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.670
 the number one division of the center goes 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.369
 to be division number two and this is going to 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.220
 to be number three we started then 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:39.350
 passing the number one division by 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.350
 below division number two 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.820
 later we passed the division 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:48.900
 number 3 below the division 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.900
 number 1 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.520
 now to go adding hair what 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.250
 let's do is the following we take 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.579
 a small part of the hair on the side 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.050
 left and we put it together with the division 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:06.640
 number 1 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.640
 we combed this side 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:15.000
 and we cross below the division number 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.000
 1 with the number 2 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:22.170
 we take a small part of hair from 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.430
 the one on the right side and we put it together with the 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.430
 division number 3 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:33.310
 now we divide that division by 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:36.840
 below with division number 1 and 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.989
 we start again the left side 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.290
 we take a small part of hair from 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.290
 left side 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.590
 We combed so that the hairstyle is ready 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.130
 we crossed below division number 1 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.760
 with the number 2 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:03.240
 now we take again a small part 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:08.030
 of hair on the left side and the 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.030
 together with division number 3 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.620
 we went under then the edition 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:19.379
 number 3 of the number 1 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.379
 and so we're going to keep doing all the 3 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:51.859
 well, we are finishing the braid 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.959
 we are taking the last ones then 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:56.200
 parts of the left and side 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.200
 straight 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.599
 it is necessary to try to keep the 

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:03.599
 braid 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:09.640
 so that it does not look too loose and that 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.640
 see more defined 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:16.510
 and ready then finally 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.510
 we take the last part of the hair 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:23.100
 together with the division number 3 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.760
 and as I said we crossed it then with the 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.760
 division number one below 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.560
 we continue weaving the braid passing the 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.460
 divisions 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.460
 below 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.259
 already reaching the end we take a band 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:42.259
 elastic 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.660
 and we hold the hair 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:01.180
 we put a bow to decorate or a 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:04.139
 visit what is easier for them 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.139
 and finally 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.830
 we add a little bit of wax in this 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.830
 side 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.529
 to finish controlling the frizz that 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.569
 may have 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:21.609
 add to the left side and to the side 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:21.609
 right the amount that is necessary 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.440
 we finally fill 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:40.430
 we have then 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:40.430
 the inverted french braid 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:46.489
 that's how 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.600
 and 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.790
 good for this braid also exists 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.100
 a variation that is called the braid of 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.630
 bread is very easy the only thing that we have 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.780
 what to do 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:03.630
 we already have the braid done and we're going to 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:05.960
 go backwards releasing the slightly 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:10.010
 from the sides 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.010
 we start then like this 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.110
 letting go a little 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.039
 we speak for this of the side 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:27.810
 and we see the difference how it is going 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:42.940
 we go then like this we return for 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:46.750
 all the braid 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:49.740
 letting go of the sides and see how it goes 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.740
 taking another texture 

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.930
 if necessary we go back to pick another 

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:56.449
 elastic band 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:07:01.779
 a little bit higher 

00:06:56.449 --> 00:07:01.779
 so that it will not be released from below 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.810
 we removed the previous 

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:14.740
 and we put another bow to decorate 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:18.640
 finally this is then how is it 

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:21.640
 We can release the bread braid 

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:23.930
 it is to taste if you want to be wider 

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:26.920
 loose more 

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:30.090
 it looks very pretty 

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.090
 this is how it is 

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.950
 we hope you liked them 

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:42.870
