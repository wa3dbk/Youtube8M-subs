00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.110 

let's<00:01:07.250> take<00:01:07.430> a<00:01:07.460> look<00:01:07.670> at<00:01:07.820> that<00:01:07.880> a<00:01:07.940> little

let's take a look at that a little

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.520 
let's take a look at that a little
slower<00:01:08.480> so<00:01:10.090> you<00:01:11.090> can<00:01:11.360> see<00:01:11.570> people<00:01:11.930> waiting<00:01:12.350> in

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
slower so you can see people waiting in

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.420 
slower so you can see people waiting in
the<00:01:13.310> lineup<00:01:13.550> in<00:01:13.880> the<00:01:13.910> back

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.969

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
and some other people paddling back out

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.810 
and some other people paddling back out
to<00:01:21.159> where<00:01:21.280> the<00:01:21.399> main<00:01:21.549> break<00:01:21.789> is<00:01:22.000> off<00:01:22.240> the<00:01:22.420> side

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
to where the main break is off the side

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.010 
to where the main break is off the side
let's<00:01:24.820> take<00:01:25.119> a<00:01:25.149> look<00:01:25.479> at<00:01:25.630> it<00:01:25.810> from<00:01:25.930> my

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
let's take a look at it from my

00:01:26.020 --> 00:02:03.649 
let's take a look at it from my
perspective

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.899 

when<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.020> look<00:02:04.290> at<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.649> I'm<00:02:04.829> so<00:02:05.280> happy<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:05.789> my

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
when I look at it I'm so happy that my

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.940 
when I look at it I'm so happy that my
hand<00:02:06.210> didn't<00:02:06.659> actually<00:02:06.990> really<00:02:07.229> make<00:02:07.409> contact

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
hand didn't actually really make contact

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.400 
hand didn't actually really make contact
with<00:02:08.130> the<00:02:08.310> boat<00:02:08.489> there's<00:02:09.209> no<00:02:09.390> way<00:02:09.630> my<00:02:10.110> little

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
with the boat there's no way my little

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.259 
with the boat there's no way my little
wrist<00:02:10.709> could<00:02:11.069> have<00:02:11.190> held<00:02:11.340> back<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.849> force<00:02:12.090> of

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
wrist could have held back the force of

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:15.530 
wrist could have held back the force of
that<00:02:12.360> boat<00:02:13.819> thankfully<00:02:14.819> it<00:02:14.880> also<00:02:15.030> hit<00:02:15.330> me<00:02:15.360> in

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
that boat thankfully it also hit me in

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:25.860 
that boat thankfully it also hit me in
the<00:02:15.569> PFD<00:02:16.019> absorbing<00:02:16.920> most<00:02:17.099> of<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.310> impact

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.660 

and<00:02:26.830> a<00:02:27.010> little<00:02:27.250> bit<00:02:27.340> of<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.519> aftermath<00:02:29.670> thanks
