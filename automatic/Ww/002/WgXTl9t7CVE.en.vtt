today<00:00:00.269> I<00:00:00.299> am<00:00:00.539> going<00:00:00.810> to<00:00:00.930> talk<00:00:01.170> about<00:00:01.230> linkage

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
today I am going to talk about linkage

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.070 
today I am going to talk about linkage
linkage<00:00:02.399> equilibrium<00:00:02.970> and<00:00:03.600> linkage

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
linkage equilibrium and linkage

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.800 
linkage equilibrium and linkage
disequilibrium<00:00:05.180> linkage<00:00:06.180> means<00:00:06.480> when<00:00:06.779> two

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
disequilibrium linkage means when two

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.620 
disequilibrium linkage means when two
genes<00:00:07.290> are<00:00:07.500> located<00:00:08.069> on<00:00:08.309> same<00:00:08.760> chromosome<00:00:09.420> as

then<00:01:26.729> we<00:01:26.759> see<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.750> linkage<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.350> present<00:01:28.829> and
