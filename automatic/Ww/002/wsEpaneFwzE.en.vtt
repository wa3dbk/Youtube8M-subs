00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:17.259
 very cool video that I loved this 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.230
 game is a mod and map game at a time and 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:21.910
 good as you can see the title is no 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.220
 touch the sand or I will put in English 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.900
 how to do where they stink is equal to 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.500
 game that is for androids that do not 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.790
 you must touch the white key 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.200
 every time we treat one but one 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.600
 game I can explain how the 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:38.230
 ok ok as there are rules 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:41.829
 the sand is the cure a little bit the evil is 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.630
 that was drowning the sand is the 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.670
 white mosaic and mosaic gravel 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.350
 black as you can see here ok 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.060
 louis the rules are the same as the 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.230
 original game the difficulty does not matter 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.300
 you just have to touch 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.210
 today everything explain how to touch the gravel what 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.590
 that I'm showing up and we have here the 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.070
 archette mode 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:03.440
 the classic mode that are 50 squares of 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.350
 gravel and here they recommend me that we are what 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.700
 which is the small type because then because 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.050
 why good they go through the 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.090
 screen and they have very little arrows 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.800
 great we have the riley mode that are 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.910
 two seconds for how much we can do in 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.310
 two seconds 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.810
 here we have what are the two positions 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.119
 and who the record is not going to record 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.360
 there we have here what is the way 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:26.900
 Zen with 10 seconds and X to remove 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.479
 the scores ok we have here what 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.550
 it's an emergency exit or something like that 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.500
 according to you have not heard there and good here 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:37.100
 we have the what the button does 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.750
 main that deactivates the counter and 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.030
 that is an argument piquenses very 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.200
 unstable and let's start with the mode 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.659
 classic that are 50 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.140
 blocks to the sÃ¡dr 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:52.299
 you have to touch you have to touch the first 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.300
 play play play play 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:02:00.280
 in my hands 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:03.010
 It is better and wrote must 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:07.010
 be as fast as possible is the joke or 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:09.399
 it's over and we're going back to the lobby 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.150
 let's get into the mode 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.129
 riley 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.310
 which is the one that has time limit like this 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:15.310
 what 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:24.860
 this does have tablets is more comfortable there 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.909
 I'm on the phone and I'm not there 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.560
 because the screen is very small 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:33.489
 Peronist my record very low the truth 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.489
 you bad that 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.439
 bus mode 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.780
 back to arcade mode now because what 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:43.370
 see and as I tell you the joke is no 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.709
 touch the sand as the name says 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.860
 do not touch the sand as fast as possible 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.320
 that we move a little 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:54.270
 and they can use two fingers but I tell them 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.270
 you have to get used to it and 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:00.000
 almost cago reminds me much the way 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.470
 of flap and see those modes that make 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.680
 minecraft turns our game is 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.680
 cool 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.300
 I'm doing it right here 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.930
 and I'm going too well wait there's something 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.400
 here I already understood 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.760
 I learned the book mode as you can see 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.400
 the book mode we are going to embrace more makes 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.030
 that they can not lose that is the little button 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.730
 magical highlights that the way to test 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.770
 How does the scores work? 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.190
 there they were not saved this time more than 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:36.620
 kill of 23 let's see again in modes 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.980
 in now 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.620
 and to start is very comfortable they are very far 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.560
 this experience like a little behind 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:49.959
 is 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:51.459
 because my hand does not interfere I lost more than 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.280
 nothing the reflections not here have to 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.960
 have enough reflections we have to move 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.570
 that now 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.700
 or you have to achieve it this time faster 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.150
 faster you have to give it fast but with 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.150
 good reflexes 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.890
 you are there is notice that yes 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.600
 it would be very for the one that I am in fact 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.330
 going nexus but nexus is very 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:17.590
 strange the screen does not cooperate well and 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:19.840
 take care easier because the 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.340
 screen is played in parts suddenly and 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.590
 already they are going to face but visual 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.360
 but fox the screen is played out of nowhere 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.240
 If they decided videos, I'll see them 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.639
 what do I say that 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.199
 let's go back and here the motorcycle team 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:32.639
 it's smaller, there's a little more but 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:36.259
 yes they have tablets more recommended than what 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.259
 juan and ok let's see 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.509
 and very fast as I could see the idea of 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:46.900
 monte is very father who likes you 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:48.940
 I stop not touching the key I do not know how to 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:52.060
 go in Spanish now in English is do not 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.620
 touch of whiteside or yes and then nothing that 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:59.169
 be all for this video because he liked it 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:05:00.610
 find me your description in the 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:02.380
 description to be installed what 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.990
 is the map mode and post created 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.420
 so that they go and enjoy it there in the 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.520
 forum in case added more news 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:13.980
 to know that in the forums we are saying 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.980
 that is epic to know 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.840
 and if we achieve it if we achieve it 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.550
 very slow the truth of people who are 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.320
 super fast please if you achieve 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:31.230
 something cool happens to me they write me in 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.970
 twitter as always waiting for retweets 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:37.490
 I feel like my fingers are huge for 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.490
 this little screen but we are achieving 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:48.430
 for s tetris this is going well we are going well 

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:53.059
 let's break my own devils record 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:56.390
 I have one second left and my record was I think 

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:59.750
 I feel and I do not tell 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:01.970
 109 there is that your records will not pass 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.290
 by twitter and in source can be 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.790
 comment how it was then nothing more to the 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.800
 individuals but enjoy the model the 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:09.590
 map and all this in fact the map can 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.830
 explore a little if I know for example if 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:14.580
 he killed me 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:17.080
 you can see that here is what is the 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.820
 lobby and there is where the game is made 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.350
 nothing else has two parts because we 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.930
 they like to see the map outside of what 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.160
 that is the mini lobby there and then nothing 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.450
 cross everything in this video I hope 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.880
