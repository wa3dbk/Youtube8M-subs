00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.730 
one thing that you will notice here is
the<00:02:03.509> capacitive<00:02:04.509> keys<00:02:04.930> which<00:02:05.200> I<00:02:05.350> have<00:02:05.470> gone

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
the capacitive keys which I have gone

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.639 
the capacitive keys which I have gone
missing<00:02:05.920> right<00:02:06.430> now<00:02:06.610> we<00:02:06.670> have<00:02:06.789> a<00:02:07.649> on-screen

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
missing right now we have a on-screen

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.490 
come back as and when you need it there
is<00:02:15.340> something<00:02:15.519> that<00:02:15.849> we<00:02:16.269> are<00:02:16.360> saying<00:02:16.599> all<00:02:17.290> the

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
is something that we are saying all the

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.430 
is something that we are saying all the

lumia devices give Jason and on the back
we<00:02:20.650> have<00:02:20.680> 8<00:02:21.670> megapixel<00:02:22.390> autofocus<00:02:22.569> camera<00:02:23.530> and

we have 8 megapixel autofocus camera and

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.390 
we have 8 megapixel autofocus camera and
with<00:02:24.940> LED<00:02:25.360> flash<00:02:25.590> something<00:02:26.590> a<00:02:26.800> lot<00:02:27.280> of<00:02:27.310> people

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
with LED flash something a lot of people

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.090 
with LED flash something a lot of people
would<00:02:27.790> appreciate<00:02:27.910> now<00:02:28.420> because<00:02:29.019> few<00:02:29.650> of<00:02:29.860> the

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
would appreciate now because few of the

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.910 
would appreciate now because few of the
devices<00:02:30.400> physics<00:02:31.209> previously<00:02:32.019> come<00:02:32.470> with<00:02:32.680> I

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.410 
devices physics previously come with I
will<00:02:33.250> be<00:02:33.400> flashed<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:34.060> we<00:02:34.180> have<00:02:34.299> the

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
will be flashed and we have the

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.130 
will be flashed and we have the
microsoft<00:02:35.519> gliding<00:02:36.519> in<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:36.880> middle<00:02:37.150> and<00:02:37.299> the

speaker<00:02:38.440> grill<00:02:38.799> over<00:02:39.310> here<00:02:39.569> so<00:02:40.569> let's<00:02:40.989> go

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
speaker grill over here so let's go

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.470 
speaker grill over here so let's go
ahead<00:02:41.200> and<00:02:41.380> remove<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.310> back<00:02:42.489> and<00:02:42.790> take<00:02:43.450> a

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
ahead and remove the back and take a

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.400 
ahead and remove the back and take a
look<00:02:43.540> at<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:43.900> internals<00:02:44.319> it<00:02:44.440> has<00:02:44.650> a<00:02:46.410> 2,500

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
look at the internals it has a 2,500

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.400 
look at the internals it has a 2,500
milli<00:02:47.650> amperes<00:02:48.040> of<00:02:48.190> battery<00:02:48.780> so<00:02:49.780> there<00:02:50.140> we<00:02:50.260> go

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
milli amperes of battery so there we go

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.449 
milli amperes of battery so there we go
we<00:02:50.590> have<00:02:50.739> the<00:02:50.890> two<00:02:51.040> thousand<00:02:51.310> four<00:02:51.400> hundred

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
we have the two thousand four hundred

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:52.949 
we have the two thousand four hundred
million<00:02:51.819> pairs<00:02:52.030> of<00:02:52.120> battery<00:02:52.450> here<00:02:52.599> the<00:02:52.720> SIM

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
million pairs of battery here the SIM

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.070 
million pairs of battery here the SIM
slot<00:02:53.230> this<00:02:53.950> one<00:02:54.130> supports<00:02:54.519> 4G<00:02:54.910> LTE<00:02:55.060> but<00:02:55.660> also

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
slot this one supports 4G LTE but also

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.589 
slot this one supports 4G LTE but also
comes<00:02:56.410> with<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:56.709> 3g<00:02:57.069> version<00:02:57.099> which<00:02:57.549> calls<00:02:57.819> on

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
comes with the 3g version which calls on

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.470 
comes with the 3g version which calls on
30<00:02:58.989> euros<00:02:59.290> lesser<00:02:59.739> than<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.220> Sinatra<00:03:01.180> 4G

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
30 euros lesser than the Sinatra 4G

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.930 
30 euros lesser than the Sinatra 4G
version<00:03:01.510> and<00:03:01.989> here<00:03:02.530> is<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:02.799> micro<00:03:03.400> SD<00:03:03.910> slot

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
version and here is the micro SD slot

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.220 
version and here is the micro SD slot
which<00:03:04.450> can<00:03:04.630> expand<00:03:05.049> the<00:03:05.170> storage<00:03:05.470> up<00:03:05.650> to<00:03:06.180> 128gb

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
which can expand the storage up to 128gb

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.690 
which can expand the storage up to 128gb
right<00:03:08.230> now<00:03:08.350> it<00:03:08.530> has<00:03:08.680> 8gb<00:03:09.160> of<00:03:09.340> internal<00:03:09.489> storage

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
right now it has 8gb of internal storage

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.960 
right now it has 8gb of internal storage
so<00:03:10.299> obviously<00:03:10.780> we<00:03:10.959> might<00:03:11.430> consider<00:03:12.430> using<00:03:12.519> a

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
so obviously we might consider using a

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.120 
so obviously we might consider using a
microSD<00:03:13.440> expandable<00:03:14.440> storage<00:03:15.130> slot<00:03:15.810> so<00:03:17.130> that

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
microSD expandable storage slot so that

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.420 
microSD expandable storage slot so that
was<00:03:18.340> about<00:03:18.640> the<00:03:19.060> ports<00:03:19.810> and<00:03:19.959> the<00:03:20.170> hardware<00:03:20.680> of

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
was about the ports and the hardware of

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
stuff it's not a compromise like it used

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:41.759
