00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.320
 do not 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.370
 hello, i am blog day, you have gifts 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.160
 dot blogspot.com and here I am with this 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.900
 card is a greeting card 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.930
 it can also be birthday in the 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.080
 that what is original is that 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.410
 has here the idea of the photito our 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.090
 picture the photo of our son according to 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.460
 who's going to give and 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.239
 I love you happy birthday 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.820
 to be the card and this as you see 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:47.550
 for die-cutting and can be lifted if 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.230
 so what's nice is power 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.360
 deliver it in this way that the person 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.280
 who receives it can keep it in some 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.080
 furniture in this way inside by 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.180
 course always as we always have 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.360
 place to write is a very card 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.790
 pretty is easy to do is very 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.070
 simple and good, here I have used a 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.360
 drawing but the idea is that you make a 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.940
 picture then there is much more 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.320
 personalized and more more attractive 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.670
 so now, well, I'm going to show you 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.270
 what are the materials that 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.270
 we need 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:26.320
 We're going to need a piece of cardboard 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:30.900
 of 10 x 15 another piece that will be the 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:33.510
 base of the card 20 by 15 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.300
 we will need also 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:39.660
 as I told you the picture we are going to put 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.330
 the word I love you or can you this 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:45.640
 write it on you on another paper 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:49.860
 we are also going to need scissors 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:52.780
 pencil eraser glue and a cutter 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.000
 these are then all the elements and 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.720
 I have also trimmed to decorate 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.780
 some little hearts in the colors of 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.509
 the two of the two papers if we go to 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.160
 see then how do we make the card what 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.970
 first thing we have to do is 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.760
 crop both the photograph me in this 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.910
 good case of course I will use a drawing 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.730
 and the word I love you and we're going to 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.099
 then paste on the card 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.480
 this is going to be the front of the 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.480
 card then we will stick it 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.920
 roughly at the same height to the two 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.670
 the word and he 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.830
 the leg 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.650
 once then we have it stuck 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:51.540
 we're going to need to cut everything 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.780
 around the doll and also the 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.480
 word I love you for that I can 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.180
 do with a cutter what can you do 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.650
 directly with a scissors I start 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.270
 with the cutter and then I continue with a 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.940
 scissors because it's easier for me 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:09.480
 cut with scissors that goes a lot in what 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:12.620
 you feel more comfortable cutting through 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.620
 example we start like this 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.640
 with the cutter 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.430
 good 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.650
 see then I finished it 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.830
 cut as I said with the scissors and 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.150
 then we have it all trimmed so much 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.879
 the baby like him 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.069
 what is the word then now we 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:47.840
 let's help with the rule and let's 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:47.840
 try to raise the letters 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.110
 in this way 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.950
 and that is precisely the grace that has 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.590
 the card that this can get up 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.599
 then we're just going to paste it on 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.030
 here we have the base we have folded 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:17.519
 we're going to stick it in half 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.329
 look how the base is a little bit 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.329
 larger 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:27.990
 when I gave you the measurements I told you 20 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:31.190
 for 15 but it's actually 21 for 15 5 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.190
 so let's go to 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:38.300
 you will see that they are well 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:40.860
 put in the video but I say 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:45.930
 because I was wrong then we are going to 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:50.810
 paste everything around without sticking or 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.810
 the word of course nor the cne m 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.750
 can you help in this way what 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.950
 move a little to be more 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.950
 quiet that you will not hit 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.600
 because all this is going to be stuck against 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.600
 the card 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.620
 i 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.060
 He said 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.860
 Y 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:27.479
 I am going to paste here the piece of the letter 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:30.780
 of the whole cugat letter 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:30.780
 and so 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:37.860
 there we have it, let's go then, now, yes, 

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:40.120
 we decorate with the little hearts look 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:43.050
 I've cut several 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.050
 the sizes 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:49.199
 we are going to put some big and others 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:49.199
 smaller 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.639
 to 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:08.510
 and because it was inside we're also going to 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.280
 put a couple of hearts in this 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:13.300
 case the orange hearts that go 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.300
 in the contrasting color 

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:28.800
 see how easy it is to make that pretty 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:31.160
 remains and the original is that this can 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:35.880
 serve also so that we can put it 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:39.270
 in this way about on the little table 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:41.580
 night or on a piece of furniture if to have the 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.960
 memory of the card that we have 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.060
 given 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.860
 it's very easy to do as I said and the 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:49.259
 idea is that here you can go your own photo 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.900
 your son's picture like that is that we're going to 

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:53.910
 give to a family member yes and it is a 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.099
 way that they always keep in mind 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:57.479
 our our love I hope that you 

00:06:56.099 --> 00:06:59.900
 like this idea and we 're going to the 

00:06:57.479 --> 00:06:59.900
 next 

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 t
