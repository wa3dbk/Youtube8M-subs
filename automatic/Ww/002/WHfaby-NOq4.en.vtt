00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.510
 hello everyone speaks offensive 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.690
 finding a new spoiler for the 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.780
 future 1.9 or even much later 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.869
 at 1.9 and good yesterday I saw Narbon tweeted 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.720
 this picture on your twitter and it 's basically 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.130
 the one where the dragon is not and 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.929
 many people began to speculate that 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.480
 I wanted to say with these photos and that I was going to 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:30.660
 be a change in the link and so on 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.130
 final hears broken those assumptions and has already 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.020
 confirmed a change and that is in the em 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.180
 will make a change with the leander 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.130
 dragon with the battle of the underground 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.720
 when we are going to fight with the boss it is going to 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.300
 change the fight system against said 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.610
 bosch against the dragon for microns 1.9 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.590
 but still it has said it has no 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.060
 sure it will be by 1.9 but more 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.610
 go ahead because he wants to make sure that 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.340
 everything ends well that said change that 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.870
 wants to do with the boss staying 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.030
 correctly done not do it in a hurry 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.790
 and doing it badly and good as I say it's going to 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.010
 change the combat system against 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.199
 the final boss of what's been my 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.810
 friend the dragon and good also said 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.120
 who wants to do it like the system 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.320
 of consoles that is to say I want to put a 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.850
 sell work because the system 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.740
 console will adapt the mechanism 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.120
 totally equal to the systems of 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.650
 console in both the xbox and the 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.450
 playstation and 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.100
 I thought you have enough plans 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.960
 say it also because this is a change 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.040
 all of a sudden he wants to do 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.390
 as well as saying that if it is already 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.660
 kill blender dragon have not any 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.890
 problem will update the in and style 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.410
 you can kill again with the new 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.930
 implemented system and what else to say 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:38.050
 also say that as I say it is not 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.850
 something that has thought to finish I follow without 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.150
 stop 1.9 but good is what you want to do 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.040
 with the best possible way to do it 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.470
 in the best possible way and not 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.910
 it is bad art in the end we go that it is not 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.170
 he wants to hurry as I said before 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.580
 because if it's not going to do something wrong and 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.630
 I prefer to do it well and if it is not 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.119
 soft continue for the next 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.979
 version that will be 2.0 or 1.10 who 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.869
 knows and said a new system of 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.180
 battle with the under dragon tell me 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.800
 how do you think this system will be like 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.140
 I say it's going to be like the xbox and the 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.520
 playstation but I still guess that 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.320
 make more changes to give you a 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.390
 peculiarity the pc version I guess no 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.770
 and good if you like forgetting a lot 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.440
 thank you for your comments and we 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.100
 we see in the next video until another 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.100
 goodbye
