tested by both students faculty and
staff<00:02:16.490> as<00:02:16.880> we<00:02:17.780> selected<00:02:18.440> various<00:02:19.100> items<00:02:19.310> and

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
staff as we selected various items and

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.910 
staff as we selected various items and
so<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.840> furniture<00:02:21.260> is<00:02:21.380> very<00:02:21.440> contemporary

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
so the furniture is very contemporary

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.000 
so the furniture is very contemporary
looking<00:02:22.690> it<00:02:23.690> is<00:02:23.810> also<00:02:24.020> very<00:02:24.320> ergonomically

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
looking it is also very ergonomically

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.730 
looking it is also very ergonomically
comfortable<00:02:25.580> for<00:02:25.790> students<00:02:26.180> who<00:02:26.300> will<00:02:26.450> be

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
comfortable for students who will be

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.260 
comfortable for students who will be
sitting<00:02:27.740> in<00:02:27.830> classrooms<00:02:28.370> for<00:02:28.490> many<00:02:28.730> hours<00:02:29.090> or

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
sitting in classrooms for many hours or

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.650 
sitting in classrooms for many hours or
studying<00:02:29.630> in<00:02:29.780> labs<00:02:30.820> there<00:02:31.820> was<00:02:32.000> also<00:02:32.180> a<00:02:32.330> green

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
studying in labs there was also a green

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.199 
studying in labs there was also a green
theme<00:02:32.959> in<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.200> building<00:02:33.530> as<00:02:33.850> we<00:02:34.850> were<00:02:35.000> very

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
theme in the building as we were very

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.680 
theme in the building as we were very
energy<00:02:35.780> conscious<00:02:36.170> during<00:02:36.800> construction<00:02:37.160> and

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
energy conscious during construction and

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.230 
energy conscious during construction and
so<00:02:38.690> all<00:02:39.080> of<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.350> lighting<00:02:39.590> is<00:02:39.980> LED<00:02:40.790> lighting

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
so all of the lighting is LED lighting

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.990 
so all of the lighting is LED lighting
highly<00:02:41.690> energy<00:02:42.050> efficient<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:43.430> heating<00:02:43.790> and

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
highly energy efficient the heating and

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.240 
highly energy efficient the heating and
cooling<00:02:44.209> system<00:02:44.810> is<00:02:45.020> fired<00:02:45.440> by<00:02:45.650> natural<00:02:46.010> gas

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
cooling system is fired by natural gas

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.150 
cooling system is fired by natural gas
which<00:02:47.180> is<00:02:47.330> also<00:02:47.660> very<00:02:47.900> efficient<00:02:48.800> and<00:02:49.040> very

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
which is also very efficient and very

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.940 
which is also very efficient and very
clean<00:02:49.520> for<00:02:49.910> the<00:02:49.970> environment<00:02:50.480> and<00:02:51.170> we<00:02:51.800> also

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
clean for the environment and we also

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.729 
clean for the environment and we also
have<00:02:52.160> a<00:02:52.190> lot<00:02:52.489> of<00:02:52.610> natural<00:02:53.120> daylighting<00:02:53.739> which

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
have a lot of natural daylighting which

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.130 
have a lot of natural daylighting which
minimizes<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.610> use<00:02:55.700> of<00:02:55.880> electricity<00:02:56.720> during

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
minimizes the use of electricity during

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.110 
minimizes the use of electricity during
the<00:02:57.320> day<00:02:57.500> so<00:02:58.190> the<00:02:58.310> building<00:02:58.580> certainly<00:02:58.970> has<00:02:59.090> a

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
the day so the building certainly has a

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.479 
the day so the building certainly has a
very<00:02:59.330> green<00:02:59.690> theme<00:03:00.140> to<00:03:00.380> it<00:03:00.410> and<00:03:01.040> it<00:03:01.250> will<00:03:01.340> be<00:03:01.459> a

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
very green theme to it and it will be a

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:04.570 
very green theme to it and it will be a
highly<00:03:01.940> energy<00:03:02.300> efficient<00:03:02.690> building<00:03:03.580> the

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
highly energy efficient building the

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:05.979 
highly energy efficient building the
building<00:03:04.880> is<00:03:04.970> designed<00:03:05.000> with<00:03:05.540> a<00:03:05.600> very<00:03:05.780> open

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
building is designed with a very open

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.650 
building is designed with a very open
feel<00:03:06.650> to<00:03:06.890> it<00:03:07.040> both<00:03:07.880> in<00:03:08.060> terms<00:03:08.360> of<00:03:08.540> the

classrooms the laboratories and the
group<00:03:12.050> study<00:03:12.290> spaces<00:03:12.680> that<00:03:13.130> we've<00:03:13.280> provided

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
group study spaces that we've provided

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.360 
group study spaces that we've provided
for<00:03:14.030> students<00:03:14.360> over<00:03:15.260> the<00:03:15.350> years<00:03:15.770> we<00:03:16.250> have

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
for students over the years we have

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.190 
for students over the years we have
heard<00:03:16.580> many<00:03:16.820> times<00:03:17.090> from<00:03:17.360> our<00:03:17.510> students<00:03:17.989> that

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
heard many times from our students that

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.070 
heard many times from our students that
they<00:03:18.350> want<00:03:18.620> places<00:03:19.190> to<00:03:19.430> study<00:03:19.760> both<00:03:20.510> formally

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
they want places to study both formally

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.770 
they want places to study both formally
and<00:03:21.110> informally<00:03:22.120> when<00:03:23.120> they<00:03:23.269> are<00:03:23.390> out<00:03:23.540> of<00:03:23.570> the

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
building and really many of the

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.759 
building and really many of the
buildings<00:04:05.390> we've<00:04:05.600> worked<00:04:05.900> on<00:04:06.140> over<00:04:06.290> the<00:04:06.470> years

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
buildings we've worked on over the years

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:08.949 
buildings we've worked on over the years
has<00:04:07.070> been<00:04:07.340> to<00:04:07.730> make<00:04:08.000> them<00:04:08.209> as<00:04:08.329> flexible<00:04:08.840> as

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
has been to make them as flexible as

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:12.490 
has been to make them as flexible as
possible<00:04:09.470> and<00:04:09.680> so<00:04:10.430> during<00:04:10.790> design<00:04:11.150> and<00:04:11.540> as<00:04:12.230> we

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
possible and so during design and as we

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.349 
possible and so during design and as we
selected<00:04:13.100> furniture<00:04:14.739> flexibility<00:04:15.739> and

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
selected furniture flexibility and

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.580 
selected furniture flexibility and
modular<00:04:17.359> nature<00:04:17.540> of<00:04:17.780> the<00:04:17.870> furniture<00:04:18.260> was<00:04:18.350> very

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
modular nature of the furniture was very

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.830 
modular nature of the furniture was very
high<00:04:18.799> in<00:04:18.919> our<00:04:19.040> list<00:04:19.250> and<00:04:19.489> so<00:04:20.150> you'll<00:04:20.299> find<00:04:20.630> that

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
high in our list and so you'll find that

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.270
