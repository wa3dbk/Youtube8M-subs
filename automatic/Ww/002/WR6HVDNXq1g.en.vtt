00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
the game but the biggest thing we've

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.940 
the game but the biggest thing we've
done<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:27.930> think<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.350> big<00:01:28.470> innovation

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
done and I think that the big innovation

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.350 
done and I think that the big innovation
we've<00:01:29.070> done<00:01:29.250> really<00:01:29.729> comes<00:01:30.030> in<00:01:30.240> the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
we've done really comes in the

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.999 
we've done really comes in the
multiplayer<00:01:30.750> game<00:01:31.020> which<00:01:31.259> is<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.650> notion<00:01:31.799> of

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
multiplayer game which is the notion of

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.520 
multiplayer game which is the notion of
simultaneous<00:01:32.670> turn<00:01:32.850> cake<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:33.780> we<00:01:33.810> support

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530
