we're<00:00:12.719> talking<00:00:12.990> about<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.860> point<00:00:14.280> 0<00:00:14.370> which<00:00:14.700> is

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
we're talking about a point 0 which is

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.150 
we're talking about a point 0 which is
coming<00:00:15.000> out<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.330> end<00:00:15.360> of<00:00:15.509> September<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:16.160> it's

coming out the end of September and it's
actually<00:00:17.550> one<00:00:17.670> of<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.789> biggest<00:00:17.970> patches<00:00:18.359> that

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
actually one of the biggest patches that

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.849 
actually one of the biggest patches that
we've<00:00:18.630> had<00:00:18.779> for<00:00:18.840> World<00:00:19.170> of<00:00:19.260> Tanks<00:00:19.380> in<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.650> very

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
we've had for World of Tanks in a very

we've had for World of Tanks in a very
long<00:00:20.010> time<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.720> we're<00:00:21.720> super<00:00:22.350> excited<00:00:22.380> about

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
long time and we're super excited about

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.620 
long time and we're super excited about
it<00:00:23.039> because<00:00:23.130> it's<00:00:23.490> it's<00:00:24.119> going<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.359> introduce

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
it because it's it's going to introduce

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.950 
it because it's it's going to introduce
physics<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:26.359> for<00:00:27.359> those<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:27.660> who<00:00:27.750> play

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
physics and for those of you who play

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.990 
physics and for those of you who play
World<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.470> things<00:00:28.650> right<00:00:28.800> now<00:00:28.830> you'll<00:00:29.820> know

World of things right now you'll know
that<00:00:30.029> adding<00:00:30.599> physics<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.140> game<00:00:31.320> changes

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
that adding physics to the game changes

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.270 
that adding physics to the game changes
the<00:00:32.219> strategic<00:00:33.090> component<00:00:33.620> significantly<00:00:34.620> so

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
the strategic component significantly so

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.450 
the strategic component significantly so
instead<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:36.350> two<00:00:37.350> tangs<00:00:37.649> kind<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.070> bearing

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460

off<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.559> cliffs<00:00:50.300> the<00:00:51.300> faster<00:00:51.719> lighter<00:00:51.930> tanks

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
off of cliffs the faster lighter tanks

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.020 
off of cliffs the faster lighter tanks
will<00:00:52.440> be<00:00:52.559> able<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.829> get<00:00:52.949> air<00:00:53.160> they'll<00:00:53.789> be<00:00:53.940> able

to push other tanks like SPG's and

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.170 
to push other tanks like SPG's and
things<00:00:58.320> like<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.469> off<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.949> clips<00:00:59.160> as<00:00:59.309> well<00:00:59.489> so

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
things like that off of clips as well so

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.119 
things like that off of clips as well so
no<00:01:00.660> more<00:01:00.840> hanging<00:01:01.109> off<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.680> side<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:01.920> a

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
mountain trying to get that lucky shot

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.530 
mountain trying to get that lucky shot
from<00:01:04.680> far<00:01:05.040> away<00:01:05.070> because<00:01:05.489> actually<00:01:06.299> if<00:01:06.420> you

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
from far away because actually if you

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.149 
from far away because actually if you
tip<00:01:06.780> over<00:01:06.930> too<00:01:07.200> far<00:01:07.229> you're<00:01:07.680> just<00:01:07.920> going<00:01:08.100> to

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
tip over too far you're just going to

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.090 
tip over too far you're just going to
put<00:01:08.610> yourself<00:01:08.700> over<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.210> cliff<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:09.920> very<00:01:10.920> big

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
put yourself over the cliff so very big

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.950 
put yourself over the cliff so very big
change<00:01:11.340> for<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.580> game<00:01:11.729> very<00:01:12.150> big<00:01:12.450> change<00:01:12.750> for

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
change for the game very big change for

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.200 
change for the game very big change for
the<00:01:13.080> strategy<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.740> game<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.210> really

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
the strategy of the game and really

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.149 
the strategy of the game and really
looking<00:01:15.600> forward<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.080> there's<00:01:16.680> some<00:01:16.799> some

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
looking forward to it there's some some

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.520 
looking forward to it there's some some
graphics<00:01:17.670> boosts<00:01:18.119> some<00:01:18.810> graphics<00:01:19.170> boost<00:01:19.380> as

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
graphics boosts some graphics boost as

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.380 
graphics boosts some graphics boost as
well<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:19.920> we've<00:01:20.070> got<00:01:20.189> dynamic<00:01:20.700> lighting<00:01:20.909> so<00:01:21.270> if

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
well so we've got dynamic lighting so if

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.539 
well so we've got dynamic lighting so if
the<00:01:21.509> weather<00:01:21.720> if<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.200> weather<00:01:22.229> on<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:23.130> map<00:01:23.340> is

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
the weather if the weather on the map is

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.160 
the weather if the weather on the map is
changing<00:01:24.000> you're<00:01:24.479> going<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.689> see<00:01:24.930> that

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
changing you're going to see that

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.140 
changing you're going to see that
reflected<00:01:25.650> in<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.369> lighting<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.850> get<00:01:27.000> in

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
reflected in the lighting and the get in

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.350 
reflected in the lighting and the get in
that<00:01:27.390> in<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.630> particular<00:01:27.869> game<00:01:29.150> changes<00:01:30.150> to

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
that in that particular game changes to

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.050 
that in that particular game changes to
the<00:01:30.479> water<00:01:30.750> as<00:01:30.960> well<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:32.220> don't<00:01:32.820> know<00:01:32.880> what

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
the water as well so I don't know what

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.670 
the water as well so I don't know what
it<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.240> about<00:01:33.420> mmos<00:01:33.900> but<00:01:34.079> everybody<00:01:34.409> kind<00:01:34.619> of

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
it is about mmos but everybody kind of

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.649 
it is about mmos but everybody kind of
judges<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.520> graphics<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.119> game<00:01:36.299> based<00:01:36.479> on

judges the graphics of a game based on

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.200 
judges the graphics of a game based on
how<00:01:36.840> awesome<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.590> water<00:01:37.799> is<00:01:38.040> so<00:01:38.610> our<00:01:38.790> water<00:01:39.030> is

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
how awesome the water is so our water is

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.630 
how awesome the water is so our water is
going<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.360> be<00:01:39.509> awesome<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:40.400> so<00:01:41.400> we're<00:01:41.549> looking

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
going to be awesome and so we're looking

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.249 
going to be awesome and so we're looking
forward<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:43.070> what<00:01:44.070> else<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:45.259> dynamic

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
forward to that and what else is dynamic

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.109 
forward to that and what else is dynamic
camo<00:01:46.530> is<00:01:46.770> another<00:01:47.579> thing<00:01:47.729> that's<00:01:47.909> going<00:01:48.060> to

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
camo is another thing that's going to

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.420 
camo is another thing that's going to
change<00:01:48.270> so<00:01:48.500> right<00:01:49.500> now<00:01:49.530> when<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:49.920> have<00:01:50.070> camo

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
change so right now when you have camo

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.670 
change so right now when you have camo
on<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.670> tanks<00:01:51.079> it's<00:01:52.079> pretty<00:01:52.470> much<00:01:52.619> just

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
on the tanks it's pretty much just

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.350 
on the tanks it's pretty much just
cosmetic<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:54.560> we<00:01:55.560> going<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.950> map<00:01:56.219> if<00:01:57.119> you're

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
cosmetic and we going to a map if you're

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.420 
cosmetic and we going to a map if you're
lucky<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.899> might<00:01:58.290> match<00:01:58.560> up<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.130> map<00:01:59.280> that

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
lucky it might match up to the map that

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.709 
lucky it might match up to the map that
you're<00:01:59.549> on<00:01:59.670> so<00:01:59.820> let's<00:02:00.000> say<00:02:00.090> you're<00:02:00.329> on<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.479> snow

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
you're on so let's say you're on a snow

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.289 
you're on so let's say you're on a snow
map<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.250> unfortunately<00:02:02.250> you<00:02:02.729> have<00:02:02.790> some<00:02:03.119> kind

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
map and unfortunately you have some kind

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.149 
map and unfortunately you have some kind
of<00:02:03.420> forest<00:02:03.930> camo<00:02:04.140> on<00:02:04.259> there<00:02:04.500> you're<00:02:04.950> going<00:02:05.100> to

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
of forest camo on there you're going to

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.889 
of forest camo on there you're going to
stand<00:02:05.340> out<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.549> little<00:02:05.729> bit<00:02:05.909> but<00:02:06.420> we're<00:02:06.600> adding

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
stand out a little bit but we're adding

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.660 
stand out a little bit but we're adding
dynamic<00:02:07.500> ammo<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:07.890> that<00:02:08.039> when<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.310> go<00:02:08.489> into

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
dynamic ammo so that when you go into

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.520 
dynamic ammo so that when you go into
that<00:02:08.940> forest<00:02:09.209> map<00:02:09.509> or<00:02:09.780> if<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:09.989> go<00:02:10.110> into<00:02:10.289> that

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
that forest map or if you go into that

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.460 
that forest map or if you go into that
snow<00:02:10.679> map

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
snow map

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.520 
snow map
if<00:02:11.830> you've<00:02:12.100> got<00:02:12.310> those<00:02:12.490> camos<00:02:13.290> purchased<00:02:14.290> and

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
if you've got those camos purchased and

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.680 
if you've got those camos purchased and
you'll<00:02:14.680> be<00:02:14.830> able<00:02:14.980> to<00:02:15.130> it'll<00:02:16.090> switch<00:02:16.300> for<00:02:16.540> you

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
you'll be able to it'll switch for you

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.440 
you'll be able to it'll switch for you
so<00:02:17.550> that's<00:02:18.550> one<00:02:18.790> component<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.330> other

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
so that's one component the other

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.170 
so that's one component the other
component<00:02:19.930> is<00:02:20.050> camo<00:02:20.320> will<00:02:20.560> actually<00:02:21.090> play<00:02:22.090> a

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
component is camo will actually play a

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.990 
component is camo will actually play a
role<00:02:22.480> so<00:02:23.140> there<00:02:23.500> is<00:02:23.620> a<00:02:23.650> camo<00:02:24.040> or<00:02:24.460> camouflage

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
role so there is a camo or camouflage

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.140 
role so there is a camo or camouflage
component<00:02:25.750> in<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:25.990> game<00:02:26.230> as<00:02:26.500> a<00:02:26.980> skill<00:02:27.460> but<00:02:28.000> the

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
component in the game as a skill but the

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.910 
component in the game as a skill but the
camel<00:02:28.480> on<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:28.660> tank<00:02:28.900> will<00:02:29.050> add<00:02:29.200> to<00:02:29.380> that<00:02:29.410> so

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
camel on the tank will add to that so

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.460 
camel on the tank will add to that so
you'll<00:02:30.130> be<00:02:30.310> a<00:02:30.340> little<00:02:30.580> bit<00:02:30.760> more<00:02:31.170> concealed<00:02:32.170> if

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
you'll be a little bit more concealed if

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.280 
you'll be a little bit more concealed if
you're<00:02:32.890> if<00:02:33.670> you've<00:02:33.910> got<00:02:34.060> camo<00:02:34.270> on<00:02:34.360> so<00:02:35.020> adjust

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
you're if you've got camo on so adjust

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.560 
you're if you've got camo on so adjust
we<00:02:35.440> have<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.710> look<00:02:35.830> forward<00:02:36.070> to<00:02:36.220> in<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.370> future

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
we have to look forward to in the future

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.880 
we have to look forward to in the future
so<00:02:37.570> of<00:02:37.780> course<00:02:37.810> a<00:02:38.110> point<00:02:38.350> 0<00:02:38.440> is<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.620> big<00:02:38.770> one

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
so of course a point 0 is the big one

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.850 
so of course a point 0 is the big one
with<00:02:39.100> the<00:02:39.220> physics<00:02:39.520> change<00:02:39.820> and<00:02:40.060> then<00:02:40.860> shortly

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
with the physics change and then shortly

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.890 
with the physics change and then shortly
after<00:02:42.070> that<00:02:42.280> we're<00:02:42.640> looking<00:02:42.940> at<00:02:43.060> adding<00:02:43.240> the

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
after that we're looking at adding the

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.620 
after that we're looking at adding the
British<00:02:44.140> tanks<00:02:44.470> so<00:02:44.800> finally<00:02:45.250> finally<00:02:46.240> giving

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
fantastic between the graphics physics

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.290 
fantastic between the graphics physics
and<00:03:05.080> then<00:03:05.170> the<00:03:05.560> tanks<00:03:05.950> coming<00:03:06.250> out<00:03:06.430> it's<00:03:06.910> gonna
