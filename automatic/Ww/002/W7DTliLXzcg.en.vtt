00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
they thought that Artega was weakening

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.289 
they thought that Artega was weakening
and<00:03:20.950> that<00:03:21.040> she<00:03:21.189> should<00:03:21.370> go<00:03:21.489> to<00:03:21.519> the<00:03:21.700> body<00:03:21.909> I'm

not<00:03:22.510> so<00:03:22.659> sure<00:03:22.689> our<00:03:22.989> take<00:03:23.200> is<00:03:23.349> weakening<00:03:23.799> to<00:03:23.950> me

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099
