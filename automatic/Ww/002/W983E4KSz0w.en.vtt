at someone named his new scientist
called<00:03:39.959> Nesbitt<00:03:40.380> and<00:03:40.769> that<00:03:41.100> was<00:03:41.220> enough<00:03:41.400> for

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
called Nesbitt and that was enough for

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.280 
called Nesbitt and that was enough for
me<00:03:43.730> so<00:03:44.730> yeah<00:03:44.940> it<00:03:45.060> is<00:03:45.180> actually<00:03:45.389> gone<00:03:45.720> and

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
me so yeah it is actually gone and

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.740 
me so yeah it is actually gone and
that's<00:03:46.470> really<00:03:46.739> shit<00:03:47.010> I<00:03:47.250> will<00:03:48.060> attempt<00:03:48.690> to

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
that's really shit I will attempt to

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.870 
that's really shit I will attempt to
remake<00:03:49.139> it<00:03:49.200> in<00:03:49.560> may<00:03:49.799> end<00:03:49.920> up<00:03:50.040> being<00:03:50.069> an<00:03:50.280> EP<00:03:50.609> in

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
remake it in may end up being an EP in

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.300 
remake it in may end up being an EP in
maybe<00:03:51.180> four<00:03:51.480> lengths<00:03:51.630> are<00:03:51.840> my<00:03:51.989> might

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
maybe four lengths are my might

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.650 
maybe four lengths are my might
introduce<00:03:53.310> Joey<00:03:53.730> back<00:03:54.000> into<00:03:54.269> folks<00:03:54.480> I<00:03:54.630> think

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
introduce Joey back into folks I think

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.240 
introduce Joey back into folks I think
people<00:03:55.079> like<00:03:55.260> to<00:03:55.410> croon<00:03:55.590> I'm<00:03:55.769> six<00:03:56.010> he<00:03:56.130> may

you know when i play zombies one and put

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.250 
you know when i play zombies one and put
zombies<00:04:07.049> three<00:04:07.260> i<00:04:07.290> do<00:04:07.440> prefer<00:04:07.799> zombies<00:04:08.609> three

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
zombies three i do prefer zombies three

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.900 
zombies three i do prefer zombies three
although<00:04:10.260> zombies<00:04:10.650> one's<00:04:10.829> a<00:04:10.980> much<00:04:11.190> more<00:04:11.459> my

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
although zombies one's a much more my

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.400 
although zombies one's a much more my
sound<00:04:12.359> I<00:04:12.660> things<00:04:12.989> on<00:04:13.169> b3<00:04:14.750> sounds<00:04:15.750> more<00:04:15.930> organic

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
sound I things on b3 sounds more organic

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.030 
sound I things on b3 sounds more organic
in<00:04:16.590> a<00:04:16.680> way<00:04:16.799> I<00:04:16.829> think<00:04:17.039> it<00:04:17.310> sounds<00:04:17.489> better

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
in a way I think it sounds better

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.300 
in a way I think it sounds better
in<00:04:18.700> a<00:04:18.790> way<00:04:18.940> but<00:04:19.720> obviously<00:04:19.990> my<00:04:20.140> sound<00:04:20.410> now<00:04:21.010> is

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
in a way but obviously my sound now is

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.830 
in a way but obviously my sound now is
very<00:04:21.550> very<00:04:21.730> different<00:04:22.000> when<00:04:22.210> I<00:04:22.270> made<00:04:22.510> zombies

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
very very different when I made zombies

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.350 
very very different when I made zombies
one<00:04:23.020> I<00:04:23.680> didn't<00:04:24.250> even<00:04:24.340> have<00:04:24.490> protools<00:04:24.730> them<00:04:25.120> so

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
one I didn't even have protools them so

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.060 
one I didn't even have protools them so
now<00:04:25.630> why<00:04:25.900> did<00:04:26.110> but<00:04:26.260> it<00:04:26.380> was<00:04:26.470> a<00:04:26.530> ship<00:04:26.740> version

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
now why did but it was a ship version

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.650 
now why did but it was a ship version
now<00:04:27.550> I<00:04:27.580> have<00:04:27.760> what<00:04:28.060> I<00:04:28.090> don't<00:04:28.300> know<00:04:28.420> because

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660

it's been stolen but i would have HD but

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.020 
it's been stolen but i would have HD but
this<00:04:31.900> is<00:04:32.050> the<00:04:32.140> problem<00:04:32.340> it's<00:04:33.340> been<00:04:33.580> fucking

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
working tirelessly to 20 dry it out

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.870 
working tirelessly to 20 dry it out
there<00:04:56.260> using<00:04:56.410> the<00:04:56.530> humidifiers<00:04:57.190> of<00:04:57.370> fans<00:04:57.670> and

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
all sorts of stuff to try and draw the

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.410 
all sorts of stuff to try and draw the
actual<00:04:59.700> membrane<00:05:00.700> on<00:05:00.850> the<00:05:00.940> floor<00:05:01.150> then<00:05:01.300> what

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:01.420 
actual membrane on the floor then what

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.470 
actual membrane on the floor then what
we<00:05:01.510> have<00:05:01.660> to<00:05:01.780> do<00:05:01.930> is<00:05:02.050> drill<00:05:02.350> the<00:05:02.470> concrete<00:05:02.920> out

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
we have to do is drill the concrete out

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.640 
we have to do is drill the concrete out
from<00:05:04.480> underneath<00:05:04.720> we've<00:05:04.990> taken<00:05:05.170> the<00:05:05.320> carpet

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
from underneath we've taken the carpet

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.360 
from underneath we've taken the carpet
out<00:05:05.740> already<00:05:06.010> draw<00:05:06.730> the<00:05:06.790> concrete<00:05:07.270> output<00:05:08.370> and

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
out already draw the concrete output and

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.910 
out already draw the concrete output and
you<00:05:09.610> kind<00:05:09.880> of<00:05:09.970> it<00:05:10.780> looks<00:05:10.990> like<00:05:11.200> it's<00:05:11.440> hard<00:05:11.620> that

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:11.920 
you kind of it looks like it's hard that

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.470 
you kind of it looks like it's hard that
they<00:05:12.040> paint<00:05:12.310> on<00:05:12.550> it<00:05:12.580> to<00:05:12.820> kind<00:05:12.940> of<00:05:13.090> add<00:05:13.210> a<00:05:13.240> kind

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:13.480 
they paint on it to kind of add a kind

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.750 
they paint on it to kind of add a kind
of<00:05:13.570> plastic<00:05:13.780> membrane<00:05:14.290> to<00:05:15.100> stop<00:05:15.310> any<00:05:15.520> damn

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
of plastic membrane to stop any damn

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.810 
of plastic membrane to stop any damn
coming<00:05:16.150> in<00:05:16.270> the<00:05:16.360> future<00:05:16.510> them<00:05:17.100> we<00:05:18.100> concrete<00:05:18.610> it

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
coming in the future them we concrete it

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.820 
coming in the future them we concrete it
and<00:05:19.000> underlay<00:05:19.360> than<00:05:19.540> carbon<00:05:19.990> so<00:05:20.140> I<00:05:20.590> basically

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
and underlay than carbon so I basically

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.490 
and underlay than carbon so I basically
