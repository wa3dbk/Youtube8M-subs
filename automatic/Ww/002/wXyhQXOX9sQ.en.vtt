00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:54.250 
case is made out of very high quality
materials<00:00:52.030> it's<00:00:53.030> going<00:00:53.449> to<00:00:53.479> be<00:00:53.629> hard<00:00:53.870> to<00:00:53.960> take

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
materials it's going to be hard to take

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.070 
materials it's going to be hard to take
it<00:00:54.379> out<00:00:54.500> so<00:00:55.369> that's<00:00:55.670> my<00:00:55.820> ipod<00:00:56.150> touch<00:00:56.180> i<00:00:56.659> chose

it out so that's my ipod touch i chose
the<00:00:57.260> white<00:00:57.440> one<00:00:57.650> because<00:00:57.860> it<00:00:58.400> matches<00:00:58.610> my<00:00:59.000> ipod

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.030 
the white one because it matches my ipod
it's<00:01:00.290> also<00:01:00.470> white<00:01:01.030> so<00:01:02.030> here<00:01:02.420> is<00:01:02.570> the<00:01:03.040> close-up

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
it's also white so here is the close-up

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.300 
it's also white so here is the close-up
of<00:01:04.309> the<00:01:04.879> case<00:01:05.089> the<00:01:05.930> volume<00:01:06.350> buttons<00:01:06.710> the<00:01:07.130> lock

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.210 
of the case the volume buttons the lock
button<00:01:09.939> inside<00:01:10.939> is<00:01:11.299> this<00:01:11.750> very<00:01:12.049> smooth<00:01:12.650> finish

button inside is this very smooth finish

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.490 
button inside is this very smooth finish
so<00:01:13.790> it's<00:01:14.000> definitely<00:01:14.540> not<00:01:14.870> going<00:01:15.080> to<00:01:15.170> scratch

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
so it's definitely not going to scratch

so it's definitely not going to scratch
your<00:01:15.710> device<00:01:16.130> and<00:01:18.700> as<00:01:19.700> you<00:01:20.120> probably<00:01:20.450> know

a<00:01:25.670> soft<00:01:26.570> rubber<00:01:27.200> silicone<00:01:28.360> case<00:01:29.440> so<00:01:30.440> it's<00:01:30.650> soft

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
a soft rubber silicone case so it's soft

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.790 
a soft rubber silicone case so it's soft
and<00:01:31.780> the<00:01:32.780> outer<00:01:32.990> part<00:01:33.440> of<00:01:33.770> this<00:01:33.980> case<00:01:34.310> is<00:01:34.640> a
