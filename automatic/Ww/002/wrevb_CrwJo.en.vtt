a certain amount of money for road

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.790 
a certain amount of money for road
repair<00:00:41.040> but<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.660> amount<00:00:42.960> was<00:00:43.290> not<00:00:43.469> enough

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
repair but that amount was not enough

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.069 
repair but that amount was not enough
and<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.579> upkeep<00:00:45.120> for<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.539> is<00:00:45.750> even<00:00:46.050> more

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
and the upkeep for that is even more

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.380 
and the upkeep for that is even more
expensive<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:47.100> it's<00:00:47.520> continuous<00:00:48.180> on<00:00:48.329> a

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
expensive and it's continuous on a

expensive and it's continuous on a
year-by-year<00:00:48.989> basis<00:00:49.770> but<00:00:50.700> here's<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.180> part

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
year-by-year basis but here's the part

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.420 
year-by-year basis but here's the part
of<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.570> story<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:52.170> gets<00:00:52.620> me<00:00:52.739> now<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:52.920> already

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
but okay you know maybe there can be

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.370 
but okay you know maybe there can be
some<00:01:08.460> justification<00:01:08.970> for<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.600> in<00:01:09.840> some<00:01:10.110> places

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
the taxpayers themselves also they

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.060 
the taxpayers themselves also they
shouldn't<00:02:33.000> have<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.300> foot<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.510> bill<00:02:33.600> but<00:02:34.070> they

shouldn't have to foot the bill but they

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.290 
shouldn't have to foot the bill but they
don't<00:02:35.220> have<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.400> money<00:02:35.520> anyway<00:02:35.880> even<00:02:36.060> if<00:02:36.180> they

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
don't have the money anyway even if they

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.630 
don't have the money anyway even if they
dip<00:02:36.450> into<00:02:36.570> the<00:02:36.720> rainy<00:02:36.870> day<00:02:37.080> fund<00:02:37.310> so<00:02:38.310> I<00:02:38.340> mean

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
dip into the rainy day fund so I mean

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.330 
dip into the rainy day fund so I mean
look<00:02:38.790> at<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.060> system<00:02:39.420> we've<00:02:40.320> created<00:02:40.620> and<00:02:41.070> the

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
look at the system we've created and the

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.650 
look at the system we've created and the
reason<00:02:41.610> I<00:02:41.670> wanted<00:02:41.880> to<00:02:42.000> discuss<00:02:42.330> this<00:02:42.510> is

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
reason I wanted to discuss this is

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.460 
reason I wanted to discuss this is
because<00:02:42.960> I<00:02:43.050> think<00:02:43.110> this<00:02:43.350> actually<00:02:43.820> is<00:02:44.820> a

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
because I think this actually is a

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.680 
because I think this actually is a
perfect<00:02:46.470> example<00:02:46.800> of<00:02:47.430> a<00:02:47.910> bigger<00:02:48.120> problem<00:02:48.420> we

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
perfect example of a bigger problem we

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.090 
perfect example of a bigger problem we
have<00:02:48.810> in<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:48.990> United<00:02:49.290> States<00:02:49.500> it's<00:02:49.710> a<00:02:49.770> perfect

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
have in the United States it's a perfect

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.150 
have in the United States it's a perfect
encapsulation<00:02:51.050> it's<00:02:52.050> a<00:02:52.110> microcosm<00:02:52.650> of<00:02:53.040> a

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
encapsulation it's a microcosm of a

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.730 
encapsulation it's a microcosm of a
bigger<00:02:53.340> issue<00:02:53.550> and<00:02:53.910> that<00:02:54.750> issue<00:02:55.020> is<00:02:55.440> that

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
bigger issue and that issue is that

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.820 
bigger issue and that issue is that
private<00:02:56.580> corporations<00:02:57.020> can<00:02:58.020> make<00:02:58.230> millions
