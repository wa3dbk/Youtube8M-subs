00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:10.629
 hi minecraft friends in this video 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.369
 I'm going to show you how to do 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:14.920
 install a mod that allows us 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:16.600
 transform us into any nps there 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.730
 in minecraft 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.940
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.800
 download these two bikes loader and the 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:27.279
 motorcycle in question 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:32.349
 and then let's run the start more 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:35.380
 the r key and we type% app data by 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:38.410
 we accept 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:41.290
 we open the minecraft folder then the 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.460
 bin folder then we open the file 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.200
 minecraft point 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.880
 winrar or 7 zip 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.400
 and that you want in which you 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.920
 have installed 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.590
 The first thing we do is eliminate the 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.260
 meta folder and whenever we install a 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.560
 mod you have to delete it if you do not create 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.750
 be minecraft 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.750
 then we open the pnÃ¼ma torio to der 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.220
 we select everything and we have it 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:18.560
 then we open the mold in question 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.950
 shapeshifter if I have a very English 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.950
 good 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:28.840
 and we select everything and we have it 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:32.200
 we accept so we close and close 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.190
 minecraft we started but could daub 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.190
 we will not be able to do it 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.660
 but we could 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.460
 well here we are to put the mount 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.500
 installed and 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.100
 I'll show you what it does 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.070
 pressing the key 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:55.630
 this menu appears with the different 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:58.330
 npc that there is in minecraft and pressing 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.820
 in some of them like for example wolf 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.250
 what is the wolf 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.590
 we left this menu 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:10.090
 pressing the f5 key we see that we 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.920
 we have transformed into a wolf but it is not 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.460
 only that we can transform ourselves into 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:19.060
 chain of fish but every npc has 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:22.030
 his virtue has his ability that is 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.819
 You can use by pressing the key 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.810
 If we press lage with the logo, we will 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.810
 have more speed 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.959
 let's go to the others 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:39.040
 in epc good we have the clipper that 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:42.130
 let's leave for the end we have the 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:46.010
 spider we can transform into spider 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:48.200
 there we are the spider 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:52.150
 if we press the articulate as 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.150
 can see scalar 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.060
 with the key activated and as you can see 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.660
 we do not need to do anything 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:05.349
 we can scale now we can go to 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:11.170
 be some chicken chickens always 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:13.540
 we change the sculpting texture of npc 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.370
 is going to stay with the previous texture 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.099
 but it's only for a moment because 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.650
 when we take out the menu it has its texture 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:25.569
 well with the chicken what we can do 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:28.950
 is to fly by pressing the g key once 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:31.260
 and pressing the bar 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.060
 as you can see we're flying will 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.660
 falling if we keep the bar 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.660
 pressed 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:44.040
 then we have the more we can 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.040
 be the inder man 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.760
 uy 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:53.540
 and his skill his ability his power 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:57.620
 whatever you want to call it is that 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:04:00.109
 we press a big g key and there 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.959
 up on the left we can see what 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:05.120
 says teleport if we point to a block 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:08.390
 let's go to it with the right button 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:12.430
 we do this as you can see there is 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.430
 pointing to that block 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:19.260
 so the truth is very good to him 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.550
 you are 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:27.270
 then we have the 12 lots that I eat 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:30.300
 also like the logo have speed 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:34.129
 and be able to jump higher from two 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:36.080
 blocks later also 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:38.979
 here is Moors 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.979
 the cenotes 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:46.940
 it also has speed and then 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:49.580
 we can be for example 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.490
 some fish that allows us to be 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:55.000
 fish all the fish because it is 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:58.770
 dry fish 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.710
 is that we are not going to move much faster 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:05.650
 and convert there the little bubbles that would be 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:08.130
 our oxygen does not pass the time we do not 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.130
 we drown 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:20.520
 then we have the snow man 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:23.520
 kessel in the snow golem 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.879
 his ability or his power is that when he goes 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:30.589
 walking by pressing the g key when 

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:30.589
 we are walking, leaving snow 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.440
 then we have the place 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:44.150
 that if we select 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:46.509
 we impressed lage going to throw balls of 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.509
 fire 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.580
 according 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:57.009
 then we have to spend too 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.670
 to me 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:08.369
 you can also fly obviously and 

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:08.369
 also strip fireballs 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:16.329
 well we have the golem 

00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:16.329
 that sneak 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:23.610
 has loaded more texture is a small 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.610
 owl that has 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:34.380
 then we can be giants 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:38.169
 as you can see there we are huge 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:41.229
 enormous what is the skill that has 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:44.590
 being giant when we can go 

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:47.540
 pressing everything by pressing the g key and 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:51.950
 pressing 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:54.430
 the right button of the mouse 

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.430
 there 

00:06:55.100 --> 00:07:01.220
 it's like it's going to tnt because we do 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.320
 that exploits everything obviously we are 

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:06.490
 being a giant people then or 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.490
 We can do this 

00:07:08.009 --> 00:07:15.220
 and finally we leave for the last to 

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:17.260
 our friend the clipper 

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:19.639
 to be able to measure then say goodbye 

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:22.580
 how it should be 

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:24.979
 being some clippers but they have 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:28.539
 liked the video they like the mont and 

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:28.539
 until the next video
