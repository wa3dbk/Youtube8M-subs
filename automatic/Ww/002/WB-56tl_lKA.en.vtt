00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.670 

compared<00:00:36.100> to<00:00:36.190> the<00:00:36.730> character<00:00:37.120> model<00:00:37.420> of<00:00:37.680> Chuck

partner
so<00:00:49.059> we'll<00:00:49.239> just<00:00:49.420> swap<00:00:49.540> over<00:00:49.900> now<00:00:50.020> -<00:00:50.080> I'm<00:00:50.559> Dead

now we can see sort of Chuck green his

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.420 
now we can see sort of Chuck green his
character<00:01:07.119> model<00:01:07.500> in<00:01:08.500> comparison<00:01:09.220> now<00:01:09.369> the

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
character model in comparison now the

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.859 
character model in comparison now the
rooms<00:01:09.700> obviously<00:01:10.180> different<00:01:10.600> they're<00:01:10.720> both

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
rooms obviously different they're both

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:13.050 
rooms obviously different they're both
interior<00:01:11.259> rooms<00:01:11.770> and<00:01:12.460> the<00:01:12.550> lighting<00:01:12.970> is

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
interior rooms and the lighting is

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.320 
interior rooms and the lighting is
obviously<00:01:13.690> somewhat<00:01:14.140> different<00:01:15.030> but<00:01:16.030> you<00:01:16.149> get

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
obviously somewhat different but you get

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.460 
obviously somewhat different but you get
an<00:01:16.420> idea<00:01:17.550> of<00:01:18.550> the<00:01:19.300> two<00:01:19.509> different<00:01:19.930> characters

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
an idea of the two different characters

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:31.520 
an idea of the two different characters
in<00:01:21.330> terms<00:01:22.330> of<00:01:22.479> how<00:01:22.630> they<00:01:22.780> actually<00:01:22.869> look

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.980 

so<00:01:32.280> what<00:01:32.550> you're<00:01:32.670> noticing<00:01:32.970> here<00:01:33.300> is<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.540> the

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
so what you're noticing here is that the

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.950 
so what you're noticing here is that the
shadowing<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.590> different<00:01:35.010> the<00:01:35.970> lighting<00:01:36.810> is

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
shadowing is different the lighting is

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.840 
shadowing is different the lighting is
very<00:01:36.990> much<00:01:37.560> different<00:01:38.900> and<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:40.950> detail<00:01:41.580> of

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
very much different and the detail of

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.400 
very much different and the detail of
the<00:01:42.150> textures<00:01:42.750> are<00:01:43.850> improved<00:01:44.850> in<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.410> Xbox

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
the textures are improved in the Xbox

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.310 
the textures are improved in the Xbox
one<00:01:46.830> version<00:01:47.330> so<00:01:48.330> we'll<00:01:48.479> swap<00:01:48.690> back<00:01:48.900> again<00:01:49.170> to

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
one version so we'll swap back again to

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.690 
one version so we'll swap back again to
the<00:01:49.410> Xbox<00:01:49.619> one<00:01:50.010> version<00:01:51.890> Xbox<00:01:52.890> go<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.400> Dead

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
the Xbox one version Xbox go to Dead

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.850 
the Xbox one version Xbox go to Dead
Rising<00:01:53.910> 3<00:01:57.260> then<00:01:58.260> we'll<00:01:58.380> just<00:01:58.500> see<00:01:58.650> that

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
Rising 3 then we'll just see that

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:10.660 
Rising 3 then we'll just see that
character<00:01:59.869> it's<00:02:00.869> taking<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.260> beating<00:02:01.470> here

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.430 

so<00:02:11.330> I<00:02:11.360> mean<00:02:11.600> the<00:02:11.690> things<00:02:11.870> like<00:02:11.960> the<00:02:12.080> shadowing

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
so I mean the things like the shadowing

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:21.220 
so I mean the things like the shadowing
the<00:02:12.800> lighting<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.430> texture<00:02:13.850> detail<00:02:20.170> is<00:02:21.170> a

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
the lighting the texture detail is a

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.040 
the lighting the texture detail is a
huge<00:02:21.770> improvement<00:02:22.100> over<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.790> eight<00:02:22.940> xbox<00:02:23.450> 360

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
huge improvement over the eight xbox 360

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.270 
huge improvement over the eight xbox 360
version

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.210 

so<00:02:27.970> we'll<00:02:28.120> move<00:02:28.240> out<00:02:28.420> into<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:28.780> open<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:30.070> take

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
so we'll move out into the open and take

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.220 
so we'll move out into the open and take
a<00:02:30.250> look<00:02:30.460> at<00:02:30.580> some<00:02:30.790> of<00:02:30.880> these<00:02:30.970> live<00:02:31.600> zombies

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
a look at some of these live zombies

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.950 
a look at some of these live zombies
where<00:02:32.530> you'll<00:02:33.280> also<00:02:33.490> notice<00:02:33.820> quite<00:02:34.600> some

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
where you'll also notice quite some

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.070 
where you'll also notice quite some
differences

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
differences

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.210 
differences
obviously<00:02:38.080> there's<00:02:38.290> huge<00:02:38.710> numbers<00:02:39.190> of

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
obviously there's huge numbers of

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.640 
obviously there's huge numbers of
zombies<00:02:39.670> here<00:02:39.880> now

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.890 

I<00:02:43.739> think<00:02:44.579> what's<00:02:44.730> also<00:02:45.090> equally<00:02:45.689> as

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
I think what's also equally as

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.449 
I think what's also equally as
impressive<00:02:46.170> other<00:02:46.890> than<00:02:47.159> the<00:02:47.310> numbers<00:02:49.159> is<00:02:50.159> the

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
impressive other than the numbers is the

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.760 
impressive other than the numbers is the
differences<00:02:51.329> in<00:02:51.480> Zombie<00:02:52.230> types

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.140 

if<00:02:55.770> I<00:02:55.890> can<00:02:56.040> get<00:02:56.190> up<00:02:56.280> here<00:02:56.550> and<00:02:56.610> get<00:02:56.910> some

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
if I can get up here and get some

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.550 
if I can get up here and get some
crowded<00:02:57.810> round<00:02:58.940> white<00:02:59.940> sofas<00:03:00.350> started<00:03:01.350> you

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
crowded round white sofas started you

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.100 
crowded round white sofas started you
can<00:03:01.680> see<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.850> detail<00:03:03.300> on<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.720> zombies

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
can see the detail on the zombies

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.290 
can see the detail on the zombies
themselves<00:03:04.890> yes<00:03:05.550> you're<00:03:05.820> seeing<00:03:06.060> a<00:03:06.120> lot<00:03:06.270> more

and<00:03:16.660> as<00:03:17.110> you<00:03:17.200> can<00:03:17.349> see<00:03:17.470> here<00:03:17.680> just<00:03:17.860> panning

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
and as you can see here just panning

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.520 
and as you can see here just panning
around<00:03:18.489> they<00:03:19.480> all<00:03:19.780> look<00:03:20.019> pretty<00:03:20.260> much

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
around they all look pretty much

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.930 
around they all look pretty much
different<00:03:20.980> from<00:03:21.069> each<00:03:21.250> other<00:03:21.430> there<00:03:21.790> might<00:03:21.910> be

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
different from each other there might be

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.660 
different from each other there might be
repeated<00:03:22.540> models<00:03:22.930> but<00:03:23.400> some<00:03:24.400> will<00:03:24.550> have

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
repeated models but some will have

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.369 
repeated models but some will have
different<00:03:24.849> clothing<00:03:25.480> some<00:03:25.780> will<00:03:25.959> be<00:03:26.080> wearing

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:26.379 
different clothing some will be wearing

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:29.220 
different clothing some will be wearing
hats<00:03:26.940> there's<00:03:27.940> a<00:03:27.970> lot<00:03:28.090> more<00:03:28.239> diversity<00:03:28.390> in<00:03:29.050> the

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
hats there's a lot more diversity in the

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.330 
hats there's a lot more diversity in the
actual<00:03:29.680> zombies<00:03:30.220> so<00:03:30.760> we'll<00:03:30.879> swap<00:03:31.120> back<00:03:31.330> to<00:03:31.629> the

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
actual zombies so we'll swap back to the

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:43.800 
actual zombies so we'll swap back to the
xbox<00:03:33.340> 360<00:03:33.549> version<00:03:35.879> Xbox<00:03:36.879> watch<00:03:37.360> TV<00:03:42.810> we're

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
xbox 360 version Xbox watch TV we're

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.479 
xbox 360 version Xbox watch TV we're
kind<00:03:43.959> of<00:03:44.019> rinsed<00:03:44.410> out<00:03:44.560> all<00:03:44.680> the<00:03:44.830> zombies<00:03:45.220> here

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
kind of rinsed out all the zombies here

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.809 
kind of rinsed out all the zombies here
but<00:03:46.390> we<00:03:46.480> can<00:03:46.599> get<00:03:46.750> an<00:03:46.810> idea<00:03:47.370> just<00:03:48.370> by<00:03:48.489> looking

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
but we can get an idea just by looking

00:03:48.819 --> 00:04:00.479 
but we can get an idea just by looking
at<00:03:48.880> this<00:03:49.000> on<00:03:49.239> me<00:03:49.860> close-up<00:03:59.190> you're<00:04:00.190> noticing

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
at this on me close-up you're noticing

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.130 
at this on me close-up you're noticing
that<00:04:00.610> the<00:04:00.849> texture<00:04:01.209> detail<00:04:01.660> on<00:04:01.810> the<00:04:01.900> clothing

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
that the texture detail on the clothing

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.710 
that the texture detail on the clothing
isn't<00:04:02.560> as<00:04:02.680> good<00:04:02.950> I<00:04:03.269> mean<00:04:04.269> they're<00:04:04.420> lot<00:04:04.540> more

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
isn't as good I mean they're lot more

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.619 
isn't as good I mean they're lot more
basic<00:04:05.170> looking<00:04:05.500> zombies<00:04:05.980> they<00:04:06.700> still<00:04:06.940> retain

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:07.629 
basic looking zombies they still retain

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:09.930 
basic looking zombies they still retain
some<00:04:07.660> of<00:04:07.959> the<00:04:08.110> features<00:04:08.500> such<00:04:09.459> as<00:04:09.489> the<00:04:09.730> blood

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
some of the features such as the blood

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.990 
some of the features such as the blood
splattering<00:04:10.480> and<00:04:11.190> whatnot<00:04:12.190> but<00:04:12.519> they're<00:04:12.760> not

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
splattering and whatnot but they're not

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.270 
splattering and whatnot but they're not
as<00:04:13.150> detailed<00:04:13.650> or<00:04:14.650> as<00:04:15.250> diverse

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
as detailed or as diverse

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:28.760 
as detailed or as diverse
as<00:04:18.320> the<00:04:19.320> ones<00:04:19.889> in<00:04:20.040> the<00:04:20.160> Xbox<00:04:20.400> 360<00:04:21.180> version

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.469 

it's<00:04:29.770> a<00:04:29.800> shame<00:04:30.039> that<00:04:30.069> we've<00:04:30.340> kind<00:04:30.580> of<00:04:30.699> killed

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 
it's a shame that we've kind of killed

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:41.040 
it's a shame that we've kind of killed
most<00:04:31.810> of<00:04:31.960> them<00:04:32.080> here<00:04:32.379> I<00:04:39.599> mean<00:04:40.599> if<00:04:40.750> you<00:04:40.840> look<00:04:40.990> at

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
most of them here I mean if you look at

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.020 
most of them here I mean if you look at
the<00:04:41.199> texture<00:04:41.889> detail<00:04:42.280> as<00:04:42.490> well<00:04:42.840> you<00:04:43.840> can<00:04:43.990> see

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
the texture detail as well you can see

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.500 
the texture detail as well you can see
there's<00:04:46.030> quite<00:04:46.360> a<00:04:46.389> big<00:04:46.689> difference

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:05:20.520 

as<00:04:49.890> you<00:04:50.890> would<00:04:51.010> expect<00:05:19.200> well<00:05:20.200> I<00:05:20.230> hope<00:05:20.410> that

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
as you would expect well I hope that

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.520 
as you would expect well I hope that
gives<00:05:20.650> you<00:05:20.770> an<00:05:20.890> idea<00:05:21.220> of<00:05:21.900> how<00:05:22.900> the<00:05:22.960> two<00:05:23.290> games

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
gives you an idea of how the two games

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.410 
gives you an idea of how the two games
are<00:05:23.680> looking<00:05:23.950> we'll<00:05:24.100> swap<00:05:24.340> back<00:05:24.580> to<00:05:24.880> the<00:05:25.090> xbox

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.420 
are looking we'll swap back to the xbox

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:30.300 
are looking we'll swap back to the xbox
one<00:05:25.690> version<00:05:25.720> or<00:05:26.380> an<00:05:26.500> old<00:05:26.620> guy<00:05:28.890> Xbox<00:05:29.890> go<00:05:30.280> to

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
one version or an old guy Xbox go to

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:43.749 
one version or an old guy Xbox go to
Dead<00:05:30.610> Rising<00:05:30.790> 3<00:05:31.090> on<00:05:31.600> the<00:05:31.720> way

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:43.759 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:46.149 

and<00:05:44.539> it's<00:05:44.659> just<00:05:44.809> a<00:05:44.900> much-improved<00:05:45.469> game<00:05:46.009> I

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:46.159 
and it's just a much-improved game I

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:48.279 
and it's just a much-improved game I
mean<00:05:46.249> look<00:05:46.400> at<00:05:46.520> the<00:05:46.610> lighting<00:05:47.289> shadowing

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:48.289 
mean look at the lighting shadowing

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:54.980 
mean look at the lighting shadowing
effects

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.580 

and<00:05:55.990> again<00:05:56.350> retains<00:05:56.860> that<00:05:56.980> visceral<00:05:57.520> element

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 
and again retains that visceral element

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.460 
and again retains that visceral element
pure<00:05:59.790> blood-soaked<00:06:00.790> carnage<00:06:01.390> that<00:06:01.720> you

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:02.470 
pure blood-soaked carnage that you

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.030

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:06.040 
expect from Dead Rising okay I think

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.430 
expect from Dead Rising okay I think
that<00:06:06.220> gives<00:06:06.370> you<00:06:06.460> an<00:06:06.550> idea<00:06:06.610> I'm<00:06:07.600> Bob<00:06:07.870> cram<00:06:08.140> and
