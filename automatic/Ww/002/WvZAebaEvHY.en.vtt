open my people attack in the actual
mechanism<00:01:33.509> inside<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.500> that's<00:01:34.560> obviously

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
mechanism inside and that's obviously

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.999 
mechanism inside and that's obviously
what<00:01:35.100> they<00:01:35.250> are<00:01:35.310> doing<00:01:35.549> so<00:01:36.110> if<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.320> show<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.829> one

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
what they are doing so if I show you one

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.770 
what they are doing so if I show you one
that<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.189> made<00:01:38.400> earlier<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:38.939> always<00:01:39.509> wanted<00:01:39.720> to

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
that I made earlier I always wanted to

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.660 
that I made earlier I always wanted to
say<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:40.619> here<00:01:40.770> we<00:01:40.860> have<00:01:40.979> one<00:01:41.189> fatigue<00:01:41.520> and

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
say that so here we have one fatigue and

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.300 
say that so here we have one fatigue and
you<00:01:41.970> can<00:01:42.119> see<00:01:42.270> that's<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.750> plate<00:01:42.990> on<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:44.280> door

and there's the actual slam lock fitted
inside<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.670> plate<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.329> then<00:01:48.720> if<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:48.960> show<00:01:49.110> you

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
inside the plate and then if I show you

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.929

you<00:02:19.450> can<00:02:19.599> then<00:02:19.749> still<00:02:20.079> actually<00:02:20.260> lock<00:02:20.680> the

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
you can then still actually lock the

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
vehicle put it in the deadlock position

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.800 
vehicle put it in the deadlock position
by<00:02:23.799> pushing<00:02:24.159> it<00:02:24.280> pushing<00:02:24.879> the<00:02:25.090> lock<00:02:25.480> button

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
by pushing it pushing the lock button

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.899 
by pushing it pushing the lock button
twice<00:02:26.819> so<00:02:27.819> with<00:02:27.969> the<00:02:28.120> key<00:02:28.629> inside<00:02:29.079> the<00:02:29.260> actual

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
twice so with the key inside the actual

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.940 
twice so with the key inside the actual
door<00:02:30.939> barrel<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:32.079> new<00:02:32.200> barrel<00:02:32.439> that<00:02:32.560> I<00:02:32.620> fitted

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
door barrel the new barrel that I fitted

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.349 
door barrel the new barrel that I fitted
and<00:02:33.159> it<00:02:33.219> in<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.430> lock<00:02:33.579> position<00:02:33.730> it<00:02:34.090> still

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:34.359 
and it in the lock position it still

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:37.020 
and it in the lock position it still
won't<00:02:34.510> pop<00:02:34.750> open<00:02:34.959> so<00:02:35.560> if<00:02:35.799> you<00:02:35.920> actually<00:02:36.670> press

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
won't pop open so if you actually press

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.059 
won't pop open so if you actually press
the<00:02:37.060> unlock<00:02:37.329> button<00:02:37.510> you<00:02:38.500> can<00:02:38.650> then<00:02:38.769> pop<00:02:38.950> it

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
the unlock button you can then pop it

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.550 
the unlock button you can then pop it
open<00:02:39.159> so<00:02:39.819> I'm<00:02:40.450> still<00:02:40.689> allowed<00:02:40.870> it<00:02:41.049> to<00:02:41.079> retain

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
open so I'm still allowed it to retain

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.369 
open so I'm still allowed it to retain
that<00:02:41.769> actual<00:02:42.540> lock<00:02:43.540> in<00:02:43.749> and<00:02:43.900> dead<00:02:44.079> locking

that actual lock in and dead locking

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:45.990
