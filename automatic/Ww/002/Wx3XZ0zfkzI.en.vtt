they're already looking at is in game
progression<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.640> how<00:01:18.390> now<00:01:19.229> with<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.619> new

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.090 
receivers coming in at 96 plus speed
which<00:02:19.660> should<00:02:19.960> be<00:02:20.140> happening<00:02:20.380> because<00:02:20.710> the

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
which should be happening because the

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.030 
which should be happening because the
stock<00:02:21.430> rosters<00:02:22.030> have<00:02:22.209> been<00:02:22.650> modified<00:02:23.650> so<00:02:24.010> that

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
stock rosters have been modified so that

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.090 
stock rosters have been modified so that
the<00:02:24.459> speed<00:02:24.790> is<00:02:25.060> minimal<00:02:25.810> and<00:02:26.140> maybe<00:02:26.530> I<00:02:26.830> think

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
the speed is minimal and maybe I think

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.190 
the speed is minimal and maybe I think
the<00:02:27.190> highest<00:02:27.490> guy<00:02:27.640> on<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.150> stock<00:02:28.360> roster<00:02:28.990> is

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
the highest guy on the stock roster is

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.260 
the highest guy on the stock roster is
96<00:02:29.890> and<00:02:30.070> that's<00:02:30.250> there's<00:02:30.459> only<00:02:30.670> that<00:02:30.820> one<00:02:30.880> guy

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
96 and that's there's only that one guy

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.650 
96 and that's there's only that one guy
me<00:02:31.510> DeSean<00:02:31.959> Jackson<00:02:32.530> is<00:02:33.010> a<00:02:33.070> 92<00:02:33.820> speed<00:02:34.180> so

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
me DeSean Jackson is a 92 speed so

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.990 
me DeSean Jackson is a 92 speed so
they're<00:02:34.870> looking<00:02:35.260> at<00:02:35.380> that<00:02:35.740> i<00:02:36.040> was<00:02:36.610> just<00:02:36.820> like

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
they're looking at that i was just like

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.460 
they're looking at that i was just like
i<00:02:37.180> like<00:02:37.390> i<00:02:37.540> wouldn't<00:02:37.930> mind<00:02:39.750> 196<00:02:40.750> or<00:02:41.110> not<00:02:41.320> i

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
i like i wouldn't mind 196 or not i

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.000 
i like i wouldn't mind 196 or not i
wouldn't<00:02:41.739> even<00:02:41.800> mind<00:02:42.100> 198<00:02:43.060> a<00:02:43.680> speed<00:02:44.680> player

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
wouldn't even mind 198 a speed player

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.210 
wouldn't even mind 198 a speed player
and<00:02:45.370> then<00:02:45.640> you<00:02:46.330> know<00:02:46.480> everybody<00:02:47.050> else<00:02:47.260> down

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
and then you know everybody else down

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.270 
and then you know everybody else down
you<00:02:48.970> know<00:02:49.150> to<00:02:49.209> where<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.750> stock<00:02:50.620> rosters<00:02:51.130> are

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
you know to where the stock rosters are

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.160 
you know to where the stock rosters are
that<00:02:51.730> makes<00:02:51.970> that<00:02:52.180> guy<00:02:52.390> a<00:02:52.420> little<00:02:52.810> bit<00:02:53.020> more

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
that makes that guy a little bit more

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.500 
that makes that guy a little bit more
valuable<00:02:53.680> when<00:02:53.980> people<00:02:54.340> will<00:02:54.459> go<00:02:54.670> and<00:02:54.940> try<00:02:55.480> to

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
valuable when people will go and try to

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.640 
valuable when people will go and try to
get<00:02:56.020> him<00:02:56.200> but<00:02:57.300> 11<00:02:58.300> guys<00:02:58.450> I<00:02:58.720> just<00:02:59.020> feel<00:02:59.200> this<00:02:59.380> too

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
get him but 11 guys I just feel this too

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.949 
get him but 11 guys I just feel this too
much<00:02:59.890> I<00:03:00.070> think<00:03:00.340> them<00:03:00.489> the<00:03:01.000> more<00:03:01.270> concerning

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
much I think them the more concerning

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.800 
much I think them the more concerning
one<00:03:02.290> is<00:03:02.500> probably<00:03:02.890> the<00:03:03.190> deep<00:03:03.489> accuracy<00:03:04.180> by<00:03:04.750> the

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
one is probably the deep accuracy by the

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.570 
one is probably the deep accuracy by the
quarterbacks<00:03:05.410> I<00:03:05.560> know<00:03:05.620> that's<00:03:05.980> not<00:03:06.190> getting<00:03:06.520> a

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580

lot of tough because a lot of people

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.240 
lot of tough because a lot of people
love<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.310> speed<00:03:09.870> in<00:03:10.870> madden<00:03:11.380> but<00:03:11.560> I'm<00:03:11.980> more

love the speed in madden but I'm more

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.070 
love the speed in madden but I'm more
concerned<00:03:12.489> with<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:12.940> deep<00:03:13.150> accuracy<00:03:13.750> of<00:03:13.780> some

come in with high deep accuracy ratings

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.030 
come in with high deep accuracy ratings
one<00:03:34.989> of<00:03:35.079> the<00:03:35.140> other<00:03:35.380> things<00:03:35.470> that<00:03:35.799> they're

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
one of the other things that they're

one of the other things that they're
looking<00:03:36.190> at<00:03:36.489> is<00:03:36.670> rating<00:03:37.090> with<00:03:37.620> regression

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
looking at is rating with regression

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.300 
looking at is rating with regression
during<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.120> season<00:03:40.329> so<00:03:40.810> we've<00:03:41.590> seen<00:03:41.890> a<00:03:41.920> couple

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
during the season so we've seen a couple

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.400 
during the season so we've seen a couple
of<00:03:42.489> times<00:03:42.700> where<00:03:43.030> people<00:03:43.060> wear<00:03:43.690> an<00:03:43.810> offensive

linemen<00:03:44.739> are<00:03:44.829> taking<00:03:45.220> hits<00:03:45.519> on<00:03:45.790> getting<00:03:46.630> like

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
linemen are taking hits on getting like

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.960 
linemen are taking hits on getting like
minus<00:03:48.090> 10<00:03:49.090> you<00:03:49.720> know<00:03:49.870> pass<00:03:50.650> blocking<00:03:50.950> you<00:03:51.820> know

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
minus 10 you know pass blocking you know

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.300 
minus 10 you know pass blocking you know
during<00:03:52.329> the<00:03:52.570> season<00:03:53.110> so<00:03:53.620> they're<00:03:53.950> taking<00:03:54.100> a

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
during the season so they're taking a

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.190 
during the season so they're taking a
look<00:03:54.459> at<00:03:54.579> that<00:03:54.760> and<00:03:55.000> then<00:03:55.570> the<00:03:55.690> other<00:03:55.720> issue

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
look at that and then the other issue

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.410 
look at that and then the other issue
that<00:03:56.410> they're<00:03:56.980> looking<00:03:57.519> into<00:03:57.790> right<00:03:58.209> now<00:03:58.390> is

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
that they're looking into right now is

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.690 
that they're looking into right now is
the<00:03:58.930> super<00:03:59.380> sim<00:03:59.650> and<00:03:59.950> when<00:04:00.100> you're<00:04:00.250> sending

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
the super sim and when you're sending

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.810 
the super sim and when you're sending
your<00:04:00.820> weeks<00:04:02.220> quarterbacks<00:04:03.220> are<00:04:03.370> getting<00:04:03.700> an

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
your weeks quarterbacks are getting an

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.960 
your weeks quarterbacks are getting an
insanely<00:04:04.690> number<00:04:05.260> of<00:04:05.470> carriers

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
insanely number of carriers

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.900 
insanely number of carriers
game<00:04:07.560> which<00:04:08.560> is<00:04:08.590> causing<00:04:09.040> quarterbacks<00:04:09.730> to

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
game which is causing quarterbacks to

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.800 
game which is causing quarterbacks to
get<00:04:10.090> hurt<00:04:10.500> and<00:04:11.500> so<00:04:12.130> if<00:04:12.370> you<00:04:12.400> ever<00:04:12.730> have<00:04:13.570> your

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
get hurt and so if you ever have your

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.930 
get hurt and so if you ever have your
team<00:04:14.140> you'll<00:04:14.800> notice<00:04:15.130> that<00:04:15.310> you'll<00:04:15.640> start

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
team you'll notice that you'll start

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.000 
team you'll notice that you'll start
seeing<00:04:16.000> more<00:04:16.540> backups<00:04:17.140> in<00:04:17.290> the<00:04:17.350> game<00:04:17.620> because

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
seeing more backups in the game because

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.410 
seeing more backups in the game because
starting<00:04:18.459> quarterbacks<00:04:18.880> are<00:04:19.000> getting<00:04:19.269> hurt
