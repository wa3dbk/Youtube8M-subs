00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.810 

just<00:00:01.230> a<00:00:01.350> couple<00:00:01.589> minor<00:00:01.920> things<00:00:02.280> about<00:00:02.520> putting

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
just a couple minor things about putting

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.530 
just a couple minor things about putting
on<00:00:02.970> these<00:00:03.149> four<00:00:03.480> tears<00:00:03.750> is<00:00:03.929> that<00:00:05.299> these<00:00:06.299> rubber

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
on these four tears is that these rubber

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.680 
on these four tears is that these rubber
grommets<00:00:07.080> are<00:00:07.580> identical<00:00:08.580> all<00:00:08.760> four<00:00:09.450> of<00:00:09.480> them

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
grommets are identical all four of them

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.950 
grommets are identical all four of them
one<00:00:10.260> goes<00:00:10.469> on<00:00:10.679> top<00:00:11.269> then<00:00:12.269> one<00:00:12.480> goes<00:00:12.660> on<00:00:12.840> the

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
one goes on top then one goes on the

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.189 
one goes on top then one goes on the
bottom<00:00:14.059> then<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.210> fork<00:00:15.480> here<00:00:15.630> gets<00:00:15.839> slid<00:00:16.109> in

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
bottom then the fork here gets slid in

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.660 
bottom then the fork here gets slid in
between<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.710> upper<00:00:16.980> triple<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.520> lower

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
between the upper triple and the lower

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.660 
between the upper triple and the lower
triple<00:00:18.230> before<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.470> put<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.859> fork<00:00:20.160> tube

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
triple before I put the fork tube

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.200 
triple before I put the fork tube
through<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.900> bottom<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:23.490> lower<00:00:23.670> triple

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
through the bottom of the lower triple

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.400 
through the bottom of the lower triple
I'll<00:00:24.830> use<00:00:25.830> some<00:00:26.010> wd-40<00:00:26.820> on<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.359> on<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:28.019> the

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
I'll use some wd-40 on the on the the

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.560 
I'll use some wd-40 on the on the the
fork<00:00:29.099> itself<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.970> make<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:30.240> slide<00:00:30.539> through

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
fork itself to make it slide through

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.860 
fork itself to make it slide through
those<00:00:30.960> grasses<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.619> little<00:00:31.800> bit<00:00:31.920> easier<00:00:32.870> this

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
those grasses a little bit easier this

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.000 
those grasses a little bit easier this
is<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.260> fork<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:35.540> two<00:00:36.540> cap<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.380> I'm<00:00:37.860> gonna

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
is the fork a two cap and I'm gonna

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.010 
is the fork a two cap and I'm gonna
polish<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.610> up<00:00:38.700> before<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.090> actually<00:00:39.270> put<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.780> in

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
polish it up before I actually put it in

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.630 
polish it up before I actually put it in
to<00:00:40.700> the<00:00:41.700> top<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.180> cap<00:00:42.620> but<00:00:43.620> like<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.579> said

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
to the top of the cap but like I said

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.430 
to the top of the cap but like I said
not<00:00:44.969> much<00:00:45.120> really<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.510> talk<00:00:45.840> about<00:00:45.899> here

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
not much really to talk about here

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.500 
not much really to talk about here
except<00:00:47.190> for<00:00:47.219> maybe<00:00:47.489> in<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.760> upper<00:00:48.000> pinch<00:00:48.270> bolt

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
except for maybe in the upper pinch bolt

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.910 
except for maybe in the upper pinch bolt
so<00:00:48.719> I'll<00:00:48.809> put<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.140> together<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.590> I'll<00:00:49.739> show

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
so I'll put this together and I'll show

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.799 
so I'll put this together and I'll show
you<00:00:50.010> what<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.250> upper<00:00:50.460> pinch<00:00:50.670> bolt<00:00:50.940> has<00:00:51.480> that

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
you what the upper pinch bolt has that

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.680 
you what the upper pinch bolt has that
is<00:00:51.989> special

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
is special

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.200 
is special
yes<00:00:54.690> so<00:00:54.870> I've<00:00:54.960> slid<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.500> fork<00:00:55.829> tube<00:00:56.160> up<00:00:56.910> into

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
yes so I've slid the fork tube up into

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.069 
yes so I've slid the fork tube up into
the<00:00:57.449> lower<00:00:57.570> tree<00:00:58.020> through<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:59.750> fork<00:01:00.750> here

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
the lower tree through the fork here

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.160 
the lower tree through the fork here
then<00:01:01.980> up<00:01:02.219> into<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.640> upper<00:01:02.910> triple<00:01:03.300> tree<00:01:03.570> on

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
then up into the upper triple tree on

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.060 
then up into the upper triple tree on
the<00:01:04.799> top<00:01:05.040> here<00:01:05.400> you'll<00:01:05.580> see<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:06.060> the

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
the top here you'll see that the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.380 
the top here you'll see that the
instrument<00:01:08.070> bracket<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.729> holding<00:01:09.090> bracket

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
instrument bracket the holding bracket

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.700 
instrument bracket the holding bracket
for<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.600> instrument<00:01:10.080> goes<00:01:12.320> underneath<00:01:13.320> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
for the instrument goes underneath the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.679 
for the instrument goes underneath the
fork<00:01:13.979> cap<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.490> fork<00:01:14.760> cap<00:01:14.939> actually<00:01:15.360> holds<00:01:15.659> the

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
fork cap the fork cap actually holds the

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.660 
fork cap the fork cap actually holds the
instrument<00:01:16.080> bracket<00:01:16.470> on<00:01:16.619> what<00:01:17.250> I'm<00:01:17.400> doing

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
instrument bracket on what I'm doing

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.730 
instrument bracket on what I'm doing
with<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:18.090> particular<00:01:18.450> bike<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.530> see

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
with this particular bike is you see

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.370 
with this particular bike is you see
this<00:01:19.890> this<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.729> booster<00:01:21.210> spring<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.930> a

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
this this is the booster spring and a

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.980 
this this is the booster spring and a
lot<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.560> times<00:01:22.830> Sol<00:01:23.159> 350<00:01:23.790> spring<00:01:24.659> sag

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
lot of times Sol 350 spring sag

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.230 
lot of times Sol 350 spring sag
especially<00:01:25.590> after<00:01:25.830> 30<00:01:26.130> years<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.700> it's

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
especially after 30 years and it's

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.330 
especially after 30 years and it's
appropriate<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:28.020> put<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.350> booster<00:01:28.799> in<00:01:28.829> there<00:01:29.159> a

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
appropriate to put a booster in there a

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.219 
appropriate to put a booster in there a
lot<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.759> people<00:01:29.909> use<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> solid<00:01:30.600> piece<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.900> pipe

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
lot of people use a solid piece of pipe

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.319 
lot of people use a solid piece of pipe
but<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.770> actually<00:01:32.009> like<00:01:32.400> using<00:01:32.790> these<00:01:32.939> Springs

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
but I actually like using these Springs

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.050 
but I actually like using these Springs
which<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.990> get<00:01:34.710> from<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.490> local<00:01:35.640> spring

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
which I I get from a local spring

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.840 
which I I get from a local spring
company<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.770> just<00:01:38.040> helps<00:01:38.400> out<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.729> make

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
company and it just helps out to make

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.640 
company and it just helps out to make
sure<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.210> suspension<00:01:39.780> doesn't<00:01:39.960> sag<00:01:40.320> on<00:01:40.530> you

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
sure the suspension doesn't sag on you

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.510 
sure the suspension doesn't sag on you
that<00:01:41.250> goes<00:01:41.490> in<00:01:41.729> here<00:01:42.060> like<00:01:42.590> that<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:44.100> then<00:01:44.490> I

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
that goes in here like that and then I

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.880 
that goes in here like that and then I
put<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.880> cap<00:01:45.060> on<00:01:45.299> top<00:01:45.649> okay<00:01:47.149> yes<00:01:48.149> so<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.390> put<00:01:48.659> the

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
put the cap on top okay yes so I put the

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.380 
put the cap on top okay yes so I put the
fork<00:01:49.890> cap<00:01:50.159> on<00:01:50.430> there<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.670> just<00:01:50.729> wanted<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.240> show

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
fork cap on there I just wanted to show

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.050 
fork cap on there I just wanted to show
that<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.630> cleaned<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.590> up<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:52.920> polished<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.549> so
