00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:09.420
 hello today i will show an option 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.170
 use sausage malachite which I 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:17.730
 did in the previous video so first 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:20.640
 i will make lizards from fimo effect number 81 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.939
 I will do them without any mods 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.789
 just gonna be sculpted first 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:31.039
 make the torso with the head and tail and 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.039
 after the foot will 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:14.540
 in the end I made 2 big lizards for 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.510
 earrings and one smaller ring 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:21.200
 Now I will make some decorations to 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:24.650
 lizards were alone and looked 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:28.180
 harmoniously it is leaves and small balls 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.180
 I'll do it later 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:40.650
 Now I take a piece of sausage malachite 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:48.710
 a little roll it cut off another piece 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:51.300
 and also then roll these two layers 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:55.230
 stack on each other this in order 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.870
 so that the layer is thicker then 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.560
 fingers form small bends on 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.950
 stone lay on top of cling film 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.950
 and cut out which shape thanks to 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:11.190
 film stress on the edge will not be acute but 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:14.940
 slightly rounded in the end will 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:18.090
 such malachite cabachons remove all 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.740
 superfluous now all the silver blanks 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.120
 this lizards leaves and balls cover 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.600
 metallized powder so they 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.840
 were like metal lay lizard 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:53.850
 on the basis and then we are already collecting a small 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:56.850
 the composition on our silent further 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:01.250
 make a stack with eyes and spout 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.250
 lizards and of course skin 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.920
 set to bake in the oven with that 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.080
 temperature and time that were 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:26.120
 indicated on your polymer packaging 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:29.330
 we grind a bit after baking 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:32.360
 in the back of the obtained basics then 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:36.980
 varnish to silver powder 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:40.070
 I will not go away further agreed to make 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:43.790
 frame of government to still stone 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:46.430
 Separately in the frame and freeze approximate 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.410
 the shape of which is further decorated 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.110
 curls and balls 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.930
 I have a detailed video how to make 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:57.740
 such a frame link will be below this 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:05:00.800
 video and when everything is ready using the stack 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:04.010
 slightly increase the wound to the desired 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:07.760
 size to enter it again 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:09.770
 from the fireplace with lizard also cover 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:13.520
 frame baking 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:16.880
 and varnish well and now I paste in 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:21.700
 the basics and in the frame the very last 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.700
 stage is going to a new wreck 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:40.810
 Here such a malachite kit turned out 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:42.880
 I hope you enjoy the video if you have 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:48.240
 have questions ask them under this video 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:48.240
 thanks for watching see you bye
