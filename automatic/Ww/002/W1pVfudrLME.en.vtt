00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.080 
sorry so it's a mixed kind of fixture of
the<00:01:46.509> minute<00:01:46.749> so<00:01:46.899> I<00:01:47.109> can<00:01:47.139> see<00:01:47.619> maybe<00:01:48.579> someone

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
the minute so I can see maybe someone

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.910 
the minute so I can see maybe someone
trying<00:01:49.389> to<00:01:49.479> Nick<00:01:49.659> a<00:01:49.689> point<00:01:50.020> but<00:01:50.229> I<00:01:50.439> think

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
trying to Nick a point but I think

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.440 
trying to Nick a point but I think
overall<00:01:51.369> Chelsea<00:01:51.850> have<00:01:51.939> had<00:01:52.060> some<00:01:52.270> good

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
overall Chelsea have had some good

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.389 
overall Chelsea have had some good
matches<00:01:52.630> so<00:01:53.020> far<00:01:53.049> and<00:01:53.469> I<00:01:54.009> think<00:01:54.219> they're<00:01:54.369> just

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
matches so far and I think they're just

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.699 
matches so far and I think they're just
gonna<00:01:54.609> win<00:01:54.850> to<00:01:55.060> be<00:01:55.149> honest<00:01:55.450> I<00:01:55.569> really<00:01:56.319> think

00:01:56.699 --> 00:01:56.709 
gonna win to be honest I really think

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:58.230 
gonna win to be honest I really think
they're<00:01:56.859> gonna<00:01:56.950> win<00:01:57.189> like<00:01:57.340> Fornell<00:01:57.789> free<00:01:58.060> now

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
they're gonna win like Fornell free now

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.209 
they're gonna win like Fornell free now
and<00:01:58.749> they're<00:01:58.990> just<00:01:59.079> gonna<00:01:59.229> go<00:01:59.469> everywhere<00:01:59.740> and

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:00.219 
and they're just gonna go everywhere and

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:01.889 
and they're just gonna go everywhere and
try<00:02:00.609> and<00:02:00.670> try<00:02:01.060> and<00:02:01.119> just<00:02:01.329> destroy<00:02:01.719> them

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
try and try and just destroy them

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.660 
try and try and just destroy them
because<00:02:02.200> that<00:02:02.649> is<00:02:02.770> what<00:02:02.920> they<00:02:03.009> need<00:02:03.189> to<00:02:03.219> do<00:02:03.459> and

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
because that is what they need to do and

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.459 
because that is what they need to do and
I<00:02:04.270> think<00:02:04.539> that's<00:02:04.749> what<00:02:04.899> they're<00:02:04.990> going<00:02:05.200> to<00:02:05.289> do

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:05.469 
I think that's what they're going to do

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:07.230 
I think that's what they're going to do
to<00:02:05.619> be<00:02:05.709> honest<00:02:05.950> I'm<00:02:06.130> some<00:02:06.729> of<00:02:06.789> them<00:02:06.909> do<00:02:07.060> need

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
to be honest I'm some of them do need

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.210 
to be honest I'm some of them do need
the<00:02:07.270> points<00:02:07.479> though<00:02:07.779> so<00:02:08.020> to<00:02:08.590> be<00:02:08.709> fair<00:02:08.740> we<00:02:09.009> could

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
the points though so to be fair we could

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.160 
the points though so to be fair we could
be<00:02:09.340> seen<00:02:09.520> a<00:02:09.550> new<00:02:09.759> 18th<00:02:10.090> position<00:02:10.300> if<00:02:10.780> Aston

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
be seen a new 18th position if Aston

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.600 
be seen a new 18th position if Aston
Villa<00:02:11.440> don't<00:02:11.709> be

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610

stoke and stoic if they go if they lose
