00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:55.339

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:57.940
 I show you how in the box here comes the 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:57.940
 delivery note 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:06.430

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.840
 as always everything super protected 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.210

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:14.290
 let's go 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.750
 first of all I ordered a z pallets worth 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.909
 this stage is tiny I want good 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.310
 I wanted to stop throwing the shadows of 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.290
 renÃ© foot and then wanted another for the 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.270
 carry a few colors from benefit that 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.090
 I have on the pallets and place them all 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.710
 together in the same palette and good never 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.110
 I had a zeta palette in my hand 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.690
 I had seen so many in videos and so on 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.149
 but I had never touched any come 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:40.570
 with your magnets thing that's great for 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:42.700
 be able to place them from the shadows and good 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.380
 Well, I took this model that is the one 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.509
 leopard you already know that I love the 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.190
 animal print and when I saw this model 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.679
 I loved it and good for the 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.940
 capacity is quite good despite 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.520
 that is tiny I think that some 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.460
 as many shadows or even three blushes 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.110
 kid is a very bad more than benefit 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.479
 I fit here, good, I show you this way 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.590
 close though there's not much that 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:07.500
 teach the pallet aceta 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.080
 and there comes the magnet plate and how do you 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.510
 I said come the metal jellies 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.640
 to be able to place them in the shadows and in 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.519
 those of cover them had a price of 11 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.319
 euros with 90 and good for wishing 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.569
 tips plus little things to place here 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.629
 inside 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:27.049
 we continue with this product here that 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:29.900
 is one of the products that I made 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:33.159
 the order is the pro corrector with seal 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.600
 from that I have caught it in the tone 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:38.330
 cream and you see 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.450
 and well it's a tube so it has 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.750
 to see 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.660
 8 grams and let's see if I'm able to 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.250
 open it because I with these plastics do not 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.220
 I'm very good, it's already been 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.080
 open comes with an applicator 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.420
 brush something I do not like too much 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.630
 and what I do not know is how this will work 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.700
 I do not know if it will be necessary to press 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.490
 yes, it seems that you have to press 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.680
 so that the product comes out 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.720
 Well, I'll show you that is the proofreader 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.640
 that is the applicator that to me these 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.580
 applicators I do not really like the truth 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.130
 and this is the proofreader 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.720
 how good at first sight is not so 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.390
 bad in terms of coverage it seems that 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.370
 has medium coverage and with tone 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.380
 it seems that it has yielded not so the first 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.390
 printing has been pretty good 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:28.170
 I commented that the price of the proofreader 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:31.050
 is five euros fair we continue 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:35.850
 taking things out of the box and I teach you 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:40.080
 I ordered four blazer lee paint from 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:43.020
 these from the jagger I took two in tone 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.930
 union one that is like coralito 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.480
 rosita and another one that is purple that is a 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.840
 last I visuals and I loved it 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.420
 let's see starts with the pawn and that is 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.990
 which is coralito so this is the pawn and 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:01.580
 there you have the name and this is the color 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:03.810
 of this the vials are fluid lipsticks 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.770
 A) Yes 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.770
 gloss type 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.610
 I do not know how it will hold on the lip and 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.690
 I will tell you when I try them and good 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.580
 Well, this color 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.910
 I think it's cool for summer I'm still with 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:20.130
 one of the ninots that is the we spain 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.720
 this is the whisper the name you have it 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.520
 up there I have not taught you the 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.680
 applicator that is something that has called me 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.920
 a lot of attention to be fixed that applicator 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.750
 more strange have these bar I told you 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.500
 good I show you the whisper switch 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.500
 I 'm here 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.930
 is one of the colors that I think more 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.210
 I'm going to use it seems like a very 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.050
 cool the next one is the other newt that 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:47.729
 it's called leeds 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:50.970
 this is the name of the iut and this is the 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:52.740
 color to see where is this that is a 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.680
 news but that throws a little more to 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.169
 Orange is very cool this color too 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.680
 and finally the most powerful tone that 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:03.780
 COI is called a purple as I 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:09.389
 seen beautiful let's raffle to see there 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:11.819
 you have the coi and note what happened in the 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:13.670
 camera looks more blue it's actually more 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:14.990
 Violet 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.010
 but I'm watching it in the camera 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.010
 as more bluish 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.560
 and well, very cool 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.570
 It's been a long time since I started 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.130
 tonalities of this type but I think that 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:29.010
 I'm going to cheer up and well here you have 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.470
 all the tones the truth is that these 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.190
 two grandchildren I think I'm going to use them 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.419
 very much and now therefore the first 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.190
 impression of these lipsticks has been 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:38.490
 pretty good despite being lipsticks 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:41.240
 liquids cover pretty well worth of 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.099
 finished thus gloss 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.080
 and well, it looks good to see 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:47.180
 how long will I try them and you 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.860
 I will tell you what I did not like anything is 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.790
 the applicator do not know I do not just 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.860
 convince this type of applicator 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:55.510
 because when I use it I do not know what 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.090
 such will slide the lip and other 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.380
 maybe I will use them with a brush but 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.849
 good in general I liked them a lot 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:04.069
 the tones are very cool 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:07.669
 there were so many more tones had 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:11.029
 oranges had fuchsias a red too and 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:13.639
 the price of each lip is 4 euros 

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:15.319
 with 99 and finally here has already 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:17.330

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:19.759
