00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 how come to a new motto review 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.710
 this time it's about singleplayer commands 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.710
 and here is your board cinderella 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.100
 yes, these are singleplayer 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.470
 commands is added a whole lot 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.240
 things so commands in the course of 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.099
 singleplayer mode also the name yes too 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.630
 We also catch the example 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.160
 At each of you will probably want 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.110
 There you already knew a server 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.820
 For example, you can also service here 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.649
 for example, use those here and 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.370
 then just enter again to do then 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:35.110
 it is back 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.610
 These are cool commands , for example 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.420
 you can also work here in singleplayer 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.620
 I can not all of you 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.360
 because now I do too 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.559
 does not grow the mega expert of 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.079
 rated I am already a few 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.030
 things but everything really have to 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.560
 that's just the only way to find out 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.390
 exploits itself so that you change video 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.070
 mediate from that therefore that one 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.750
 a bit complex we still look 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.550
 time if you / give help you have 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.810
 now on the theme of minister shape 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.180
 typing you will find such a few command 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:03.190
 these still all the commands of world 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:05.500
 edit then here are all the commands 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.930
 want to have you as possibly want because 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.970
 now, for example, if the / binds 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.360
 then type in a letter m 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.619
 letters and then turn the leg 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.119
 that was right so i do not know 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.259
 you can hold both you can by the way 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.240
 even if you do not come in 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:23.800
 You know, there you can say for example 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:30.370
 cry kate bush or something i know it 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:31.510
 gif vision 13 11 does not exactly mean that 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.610
 Of course, there's this age today 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.409
 not between 1 2013, of course 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.659
 not at single player are therefore 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.820
 you have to give a cent which items 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.979
 theo if you press the button that 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.000
 actually as a cool thing but if you 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.619
 that really needs me now 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.390
 but not really cool 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.210
 idea that insert then always give 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.159
 back in our hero menu what can you do 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.070
 otherwise it is nice to win, for example 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.110
 The home it works will work 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.430
 apparently not what ever counts 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.880
 does not work if it is stuck 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:03.700
 you built your replays and 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.200
 remove is all tournament items turn 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.540
 if you have a budget, you can all 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.799
 killing normal animals is now too 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.680
 an error message is more schematic 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:13.180
 buggy is when it enters the front you come 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.799
 usually to spawnen but also 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.720
 again, it does not work as you do 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:18.939
 Unfortunately, these are a few things 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.500
 here are still buggy and how to 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:22.000
 She, for example , gives one here and there 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.360
 I can still try it 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.060
 the whole plugins fight 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.350
 the plugins show the whole novel 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.450
 which may have to work like 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:39.270
 for example, what was that here now 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:40.290
 pcx was the super six so single there 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.730
 I can say here for example now 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.540
 you can already see how bad it is 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.400
 can degrade 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.660
 I am really in normal mode and 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.190
 which i want to go through 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.630
 Knock when you can see says 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.350
 once you click, everything goes here 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.340
 away and that with the left one can do that 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.570
 again exhibit again 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.740
 when i say change or if i change now 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.000
 again this is actually it 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.310
 but if I do it again 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.290
 it starts again 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.340
 tock tock tock tock yes what not so 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.989
 important that it is actually a whole 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.580
 cool command what else have here 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.050
 at the start, for example, we have 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.489
 I would have to jump there as well 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.720
 go up that's what we do now 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:20.489
 same time as I can in there was his st 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.890
 so are upwardly total by the blanket 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.180
 can also jump sometimes then you look 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.920
 by the man against jumps so one 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.510
 A little bit through the area because I am now 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:32.400
 say jump to bach you see 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.620
 if i can say for example 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.489
 I would like to heal another mg 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.010
 because I'm just a bit 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:42.390
 Damage we collect here says yes 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:46.700
 also / 4 1 1 what is that partly 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.700
 here are the things it does not 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.690
 work if I'm on it now 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.370
 everything is broken then jump 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.260
 you can say for example the gm 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.950
 if you gm 1 1 culminating game mode 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:02.489
 immediately activated gm 0 g m2 is adventure 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.470
 little works gm 1 thats all 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.760
 whole command then you can to 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.630
 Example also say if I am now 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.980
 here in the world command when I say how 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.510
 I can about my sword 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.549
 find and then right-click one 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.620
 Create a tree that's just a cool one 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.910
 Actually I would do things with it 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.290
 Again, you can handle it 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.060
 First, do not use that again 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.470
 reverse or respectively 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.640
 to practice on another block 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.910
 would that on this sword here for 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.500
 example zack zack zack 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.120
 There are many commands here 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.160
 really are for minorities 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.479
 i could kill everyone here too 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.229
 Example where the meaning lies with it knows 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:36.229
 I'm not sure right now 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.560
 I also killed myself like that 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.500
 can actually see no sense in doing so 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.850
 then, for example, we still have 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.470
 decide that is also in command too 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.360
 you can use them but if you 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.310
 at least it becomes relatively unnecessary if you 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.380
 in chains free, this works 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.590
 It's not magic at all here 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:05:00.780
 still there are many commands so then 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:02.040
 celebrate 1 what is crucial here 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.720
 is when we are in the chat list, for example 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.330
 we can now enter the whole here 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:12.690
 numbers that we need for example 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:14.970
 removed 17 18 decisively at 17 1 so 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.350
 now we have it on here as you can see 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.210
 that can be a bit awkward everything 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.710
 where you first whisper them 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.860
 but what's up really fast? 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.420
 can see in all possible comma in it 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.730
 I've shown as a bit 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.230
 really many really no 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:31.550
 sense now arise for example 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:34.080
 would say estimates born does it here 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.530
 legal barriers I come there too 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.090
 not out 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.770
 So normally you have to do it there 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.750
 get there if I put in the front 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.180
 if I would have difficulty maker 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.630
 I hope it still works 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:49.260
 dippel cult 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:50.550
 oh yes title kulti 1 maybe it's easy 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.010
 2 is normal 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.930
 three starts four is nothing new 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.850
 peaceful yes these are just a few 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:01.170
 cool thing with that I can 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:03.000
 usually xp 5000 so I have one 

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:05.070
 I can give them 5000 points 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.720
 make all time if I want so 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.310
 also a very cool command 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.020
 if your taste here the oat branch 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.610
 also wanted to bind again necessarily 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.430
 want to get rid of these things they are 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.390
 just online and you can with 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.190
 Do not do anything here anymore 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.810
 yes that was it from this word review 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.890
 even if a few things are buggy 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.870
 actually quite cool j 

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:23.160
 I also love this mod 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.660
 new rating system because I have one 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.740
 I'm a little bit sophisticated 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.280
 now what if do that as unfortunately 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.410
 to forget 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:31.410
 I give this murder here with three 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:34.800
 so 3 vision points the thing 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:37.260
 Unfortunately, this is relatively buggy 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.720
 which is unfortunately a pity but of 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:41.160
 therefore I give you 3 vision points and 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.580
 See you at the next review 

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.580
 bye
