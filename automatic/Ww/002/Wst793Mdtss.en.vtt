00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.480 
incredibly fast beautiful wave lands
back<00:02:01.280> here<00:02:02.680> he<00:02:03.680> kinda<00:02:03.920> he<00:02:04.040> missed<00:02:04.220> a<00:02:04.310> backer

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
back here he kinda he missed a backer

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.570 
back here he kinda he missed a backer
opportunity<00:02:05.090> there<00:02:05.380> but<00:02:06.460> there<00:02:07.460> you<00:02:07.550> go

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
opportunity there but there you go

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.550 
opportunity there but there you go
there's<00:02:08.300> a<00:02:08.390> big<00:02:08.510> guy<00:02:08.690> takes<00:02:08.810> a<00:02:08.960> stock<00:02:09.260> and<00:02:09.500> I

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
there's a big guy takes a stock and I

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.310 
there's a big guy takes a stock and I
was<00:02:09.679> up<00:02:09.770> 31<00:02:10.010> he<00:02:10.580> has<00:02:10.760> no<00:02:11.000> risk<00:02:11.300> of<00:02:11.510> being<00:02:11.930> rested

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
was up 31 he has no risk of being rested

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.260 
was up 31 he has no risk of being rested
at<00:02:12.440> this<00:02:12.590> point<00:02:12.800> because<00:02:13.610> he<00:02:13.820> knows<00:02:13.970> every

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
at this point because he knows every

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.760 
at this point because he knows every
rest<00:02:14.480> is<00:02:14.600> just<00:02:14.630> going<00:02:14.810> to<00:02:14.870> add<00:02:15.110> so<00:02:15.440> much<00:02:15.560> damage

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
rest is just going to add so much damage

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.070 
rest is just going to add so much damage
so<00:02:15.980> he<00:02:16.100> could<00:02:16.220> play<00:02:16.280> pretty<00:02:16.520> risky<00:02:17.080> especially

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
so he could play pretty risky especially

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.180 
so he could play pretty risky especially
like<00:02:18.410> 32<00:02:18.710> I<00:02:19.100> mean<00:02:19.370> even<00:02:19.910> against<00:02:20.210> resin<00:02:20.420> spikes

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
like 32 I mean even against resin spikes

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.460 
like 32 I mean even against resin spikes
like<00:02:22.190> puff<00:02:22.610> is<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:22.910> opposite<00:02:23.360> of<00:02:23.480> other

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
like puff is the opposite of other

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.410 
like puff is the opposite of other
characters<00:02:24.950> when<00:02:25.160> when<00:02:25.370> you<00:02:25.400> have<00:02:25.610> a<00:02:25.640> lead<00:02:25.910> you

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
characters when when you have a lead you

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.360 
characters when when you have a lead you
should<00:02:26.570> play<00:02:26.720> more<00:02:26.900> risky<00:02:27.260> because<00:02:28.040> puff

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
should play more risky because puff

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.970 
should play more risky because puff
loses<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.420> trump<00:02:29.660> card<00:02:29.870> right<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:30.800> you<00:02:30.860> can

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
loses the trump card right and you can

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.650 
loses the trump card right and you can
just<00:02:31.100> you<00:02:31.430> can<00:02:31.459> do<00:02:31.700> things<00:02:31.880> that<00:02:32.150> puff<00:02:32.390> is<00:02:32.540> not

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
just you can do things that puff is not

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.290 
just you can do things that puff is not
used<00:02:32.870> together<00:02:32.989> like<00:02:33.470> going<00:02:34.010> for<00:02:34.220> risky<00:02:35.030> grabs

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
used together like going for risky grabs

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.630 
used together like going for risky grabs
yeah<00:02:36.170> you<00:02:36.440> know<00:02:36.530> a<00:02:36.920> whole<00:02:37.250> lot<00:02:37.280> of<00:02:37.400> shield

four<00:03:28.490> species<00:03:28.730> 28-percent<00:03:30.550> see<00:03:31.550> how<00:03:31.790> is<00:03:31.850> idea

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
four species 28-percent see how is idea

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.910 
four species 28-percent see how is idea
gonna<00:03:32.270> make<00:03:32.390> it<00:03:32.480> back<00:03:32.600> gets<00:03:33.200> right<00:03:33.410> on<00:03:33.440> milkman

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
gonna make it back gets right on milkman

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.530 
gonna make it back gets right on milkman
it's<00:03:34.040> not<00:03:34.130> messing<00:03:34.370> with<00:03:34.490> it<00:03:34.640> it's<00:03:35.060> few<00:03:35.240> lasers

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
it's not messing with it it's few lasers

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.720 
it's not messing with it it's few lasers
in<00:03:35.690> ideas<00:03:36.380> looking<00:03:36.650> for<00:03:36.860> it<00:03:36.980> gets<00:03:37.370> back<00:03:37.550> into

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
in ideas looking for it gets back into

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.520 
in ideas looking for it gets back into
the<00:03:37.790> phase<00:03:38.030> and<00:03:38.240> slice<00:03:38.600> he's<00:03:39.050> gonna<00:03:39.170> live<00:03:39.290> one

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
the phase and slice he's gonna live one

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.470 
the phase and slice he's gonna live one
more<00:03:41.620> more<00:03:42.620> lasers<00:03:42.980> one<00:03:43.880> back<00:03:44.090> here<00:03:44.240> I'll<00:03:44.360> do

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
more more lasers one back here I'll do

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.390 
more more lasers one back here I'll do
it<00:03:44.630> I<00:03:44.810> think<00:03:45.530> he<00:03:45.620> kind<00:03:45.770> of<00:03:45.830> wants<00:03:46.040> to<00:03:46.100> keep<00:03:46.250> him

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
it I think he kind of wants to keep him

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.590 
it I think he kind of wants to keep him
at<00:03:46.520> this<00:03:46.640> percentage<00:03:46.970> so<00:03:47.120> you<00:03:47.180> get<00:03:47.330> the<00:03:47.420> rest

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
at this percentage so you get the rest

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.790 
at this percentage so you get the rest
if<00:03:47.690> he<00:03:47.750> gets<00:03:47.900> him<00:03:48.020> a<00:03:48.080> little<00:03:48.260> too<00:03:48.350> high<00:03:48.500> then<00:03:48.710> he

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
if he gets him a little too high then he

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.890 
if he gets him a little too high then he

the particular yeah the fourth fest were
good<00:04:09.410> notice<00:04:10.150> the<00:04:11.150> reason<00:04:11.450> why<00:04:11.510> they<00:04:11.630> work<00:04:11.810> is

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:11.960 
good notice the reason why they work is

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.450 
good notice the reason why they work is
because<00:04:12.110> milkmaids<00:04:12.890> with<00:04:12.980> a<00:04:13.070> lot<00:04:13.220> of<00:04:13.310> arrows

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:13.460 
because milkmaids with a lot of arrows

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.340 
because milkmaids with a lot of arrows
had<00:04:13.790> to<00:04:13.880> shield<00:04:14.090> on<00:04:14.390> the<00:04:14.420> pump<00:04:14.750> right<00:04:15.080> he<00:04:15.290> did

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
had to shield on the pump right he did

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.990 
had to shield on the pump right he did
like<00:04:15.530> a<00:04:15.560> media<00:04:15.830> back<00:04:16.010> here<00:04:16.190> at<00:04:16.280> a<00:04:16.310> shield<00:04:16.580> so

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
like a media back here at a shield so

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.270 
like a media back here at a shield so
what<00:04:17.150> I<00:04:17.180> did<00:04:17.630> is<00:04:17.690> selected<00:04:18.080> wave<00:04:18.290> dashes<00:04:18.770> which

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
what I did is selected wave dashes which

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.890 
what I did is selected wave dashes which
would<00:04:19.400> go<00:04:19.520> stick<00:04:19.820> under<00:04:20.030> the<00:04:20.210> back<00:04:20.390> air<00:04:20.660> and

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
would go stick under the back air and

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.660 
would go stick under the back air and
then<00:04:21.170> he's<00:04:21.260> an<00:04:21.350> immediate<00:04:21.620> F<00:04:21.739> smash<00:04:22.010> so<00:04:22.580> the
