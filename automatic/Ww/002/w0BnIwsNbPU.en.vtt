to try pullback without a chair you can
start<00:00:36.450> off<00:00:36.600> by<00:00:36.630> leaning<00:00:37.079> on<00:00:37.170> your<00:00:37.320> heels<00:00:37.620> to

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
sound so just sound like this with the

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:50.720 
sound so just sound like this with the
heel<00:00:48.320> if<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.469> want<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.739> do<00:00:49.860> multiple<00:00:50.340> in<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.550> row

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
heel if you want to do multiple in a row

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.490 
heel if you want to do multiple in a row

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
you won't have enough time to lean on

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.100 
you won't have enough time to lean on
your<00:00:52.620> heels<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.129> do<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.969> move<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:54.809> that's

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
your heels and do the move so that's

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.660 
your heels and do the move so that's
when<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.649> have<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.890> chop<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.309> do<00:00:56.550> the

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:10.030 

so<00:01:03.300> multiple<00:01:03.780> would<00:01:03.930> sound<00:01:04.170> like<00:01:04.260> this

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.860 

they<00:01:10.790> double<00:01:11.060> pullback<00:01:11.240> is<00:01:11.510> a<00:01:11.540> bit<00:01:11.750> more

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:11.870 
they double pullback is a bit more

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.900 
they double pullback is a bit more
difficult<00:01:12.290> and<00:01:12.440> requires<00:01:12.830> for<00:01:13.070> sound<00:01:13.340> it

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:13.910 
difficult and requires for sound it

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.940 
difficult and requires for sound it
starts<00:01:14.360> off<00:01:14.510> by<00:01:14.750> spanking<00:01:15.170> your<00:01:15.440> right<00:01:15.620> foot

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.150 
a chair and doing the wing sitting down
just<00:02:29.870> you<00:02:30.019> can<00:02:30.170> get<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.380> rhythm<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:30.950> how<00:02:31.010> they

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
just you can get the rhythm and how they

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.910 
just you can get the rhythm and how they
sound<00:02:31.400> like<00:02:31.870> so<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:32.989> first<00:02:33.200> step<00:02:33.410> in<00:02:33.590> a<00:02:33.709> wing

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
sound like so the first step in a wing

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.949 
sound like so the first step in a wing
is<00:02:34.100> to<00:02:34.340> scrape<00:02:34.640> both<00:02:34.850> feet<00:02:35.209> apart<00:02:35.630> from<00:02:35.840> each
