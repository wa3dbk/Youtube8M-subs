00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:37.350
 only in marseille bordeaux anatel 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.510

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.720
 this lower part 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:46.220
 he follows with this ease are you 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:50.790
 will find some resistance 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:53.820
 When Jean arrives at the door because she 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.470
 this also serves as locking cap 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:00.890
 so you're going to have to pull a 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.890
 little for power is completely 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:16.180
 they never tell a dog and then they door 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:21.790

 everything can be done and unpack plate 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:52.410
 Processor street time
