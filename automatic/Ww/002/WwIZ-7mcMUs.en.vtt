some<00:00:21.600> quite<00:00:21.900> interesting<00:00:21.930> gameplay<00:00:23.330> very

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
some quite interesting gameplay very

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.140 
some quite interesting gameplay very
very<00:00:24.570> japanese-style<00:00:25.140> as<00:00:25.529> you<00:00:25.920> might<00:00:26.099> expect

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.609 

from<00:00:30.150> having<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.539> slightly<00:00:30.900> crazy<00:00:31.109> name<00:00:31.470> I

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
from having a slightly crazy name I

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:32.720 
from having a slightly crazy name I
think<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.859> gets<00:00:32.099> lost<00:00:32.340> in<00:00:32.489> translation

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
think it gets lost in translation

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.569 
think it gets lost in translation
somewhere<00:00:33.500> but<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.559> idea<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:34.829> giant<00:00:35.219> robots

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
somewhere but the idea is giant robots

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.180 
somewhere but the idea is giant robots
giant<00:00:36.090> robots<00:00:36.390> with<00:00:36.540> guns<00:00:36.809> enemy<00:00:37.649> robots<00:00:38.040> with

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
giant robots with guns enemy robots with

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.420

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
guns you blow things up uses gyroscopes

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.459 
guns you blow things up uses gyroscopes
so<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.300> have<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.600> dodge<00:00:42.930> around<00:00:43.230> and

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
so you have to dodge around and

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.200 
so you have to dodge around and
what-have-you<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.010> shoot<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:45.030> it's<00:00:45.149> like

quite fun gameplay as well but quite

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.280 
quite fun gameplay as well but quite

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
you get power-ups as you're going along

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.090 
you get power-ups as you're going along
and<00:01:13.000> there<00:01:13.270> are<00:01:13.329> giant<00:01:13.570> bosses<00:01:13.869> at<00:01:14.829> the<00:01:14.860> end

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
and there are giant bosses at the end

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.319 
and there are giant bosses at the end
which<00:01:15.310> are<00:01:15.430> going<00:01:15.520> to<00:01:15.610> quite<00:01:15.759> require<00:01:16.030> quite<00:01:16.270> a

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:16.329 
which are going to quite require quite a

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:18.060 
which are going to quite require quite a
bit<00:01:16.420> of<00:01:16.600> concentration<00:01:17.110> and<00:01:17.649> skill<00:01:17.920> to

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
bit of concentration and skill to

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.270 
bit of concentration and skill to
actually<00:01:18.369> beat<00:01:19.530> like<00:01:20.530> any<00:01:20.710> bullet<00:01:21.009> storm<00:01:21.189> hell

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
actually beat like any bullet storm hell

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.880 
actually beat like any bullet storm hell
game<00:01:21.549> it's<00:01:21.939> quite<00:01:22.210> tricky<00:01:22.689> maybe<00:01:23.409> even<00:01:23.680> more

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
game it's quite tricky maybe even more

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.830 
game it's quite tricky maybe even more
difficult<00:01:24.340> I<00:01:24.399> suppose<00:01:24.430> because<00:01:25.030> it's<00:01:25.180> in<00:01:25.299> 3d

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
difficult I suppose because it's in 3d

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.270 
difficult I suppose because it's in 3d
so<00:01:26.259> you're<00:01:26.380> kind<00:01:26.530> of<00:01:26.590> having<00:01:26.740> to<00:01:26.829> think<00:01:26.979> about

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
so you're kind of having to think about

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.359 
so you're kind of having to think about
a<00:01:27.549> whole<00:01:28.479> lot<00:01:28.780> more<00:01:29.229> while<00:01:29.470> you<00:01:29.590> play<00:01:30.009> and

a whole lot more while you play and

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:33.359 
a whole lot more while you play and
talking<00:01:31.240> becomes<00:01:31.570> difficult

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
talking becomes difficult

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.249 
talking becomes difficult
