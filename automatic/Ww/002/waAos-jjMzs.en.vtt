head you see how it's kind of snapping
and<00:01:43.110> it's<00:01:43.259> out<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.500> place<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.250> then<00:01:44.430> really

if<00:02:23.459> you<00:02:23.610> will<00:02:23.850> you<00:02:24.030> don't<00:02:24.209> really<00:02:24.450> ever<00:02:24.860> see<00:02:25.860> it

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
if you will you don't really ever see it

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.680 
if you will you don't really ever see it
work<00:02:26.340> at<00:02:26.640> word<00:02:26.850> because<00:02:27.150> all<00:02:27.330> that<00:02:27.480> does<00:02:27.660> is

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
work at word because all that does is

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.540 
work at word because all that does is
determined<00:02:28.319> what<00:02:28.440> happens<00:02:28.830> in<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:28.980> game<00:02:29.280> and

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
determined what happens in the game and

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.600 
determined what happens in the game and
apparently<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:31.110> has<00:02:31.260> absolutely<00:02:31.500> nothing<00:02:32.370> to

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
apparently it has absolutely nothing to

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.390 
apparently it has absolutely nothing to
do<00:02:32.910> with<00:02:33.780> what<00:02:33.810> you<00:02:34.200> see<00:02:34.530> because<00:02:34.739> the<00:02:35.160> ball

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
do with what you see because the ball

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.949 
do with what you see because the ball
can<00:02:35.580> just<00:02:35.790> go<00:02:35.910> right<00:02:35.940> through<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.510> defenders

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
can just go right through the defenders

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.699 
can just go right through the defenders
head<00:02:37.140> even<00:02:37.500> though<00:02:37.620> he<00:02:37.650> headed<00:02:38.069> it<00:02:38.190> away<00:02:38.430> um

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
head even though he headed it away um

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.260 
head even though he headed it away um
but<00:02:40.709> that's<00:02:40.950> not<00:02:41.130> really<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.640> issue<00:02:41.670> the

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
but that's not really the issue the

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.390 
but that's not really the issue the
issue<00:02:42.300> is<00:02:42.870> that<00:02:43.670> headers<00:02:44.670> Oh<00:02:44.940> way<00:02:45.690> way

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
issue is that headers Oh way way

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.729 
issue is that headers Oh way way
overpowered<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:47.730> you<00:02:48.600> know<00:02:48.720> this<00:02:48.959> is<00:02:49.320> a<00:02:49.350> good

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
overpowered and you know this is a good

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.449 
overpowered and you know this is a good
example<00:02:49.890> of<00:02:50.459> a<00:02:50.580> graphical<00:02:51.209> glitch<00:02:51.570> and<00:02:52.459> it

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
example of a graphical glitch and it

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.759 
example of a graphical glitch and it
doesn't<00:02:53.850> really<00:02:54.300> highlight<00:02:54.989> the<00:02:55.230> main<00:02:55.530> issue

too<00:03:03.360> accurate<00:03:03.989> I<00:03:04.670> mean<00:03:05.670> how<00:03:06.000> many<00:03:06.060> times<00:03:06.569> have

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
too accurate I mean how many times have

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.770 
too accurate I mean how many times have
you<00:03:06.900> seen<00:03:07.200> a<00:03:07.260> striker<00:03:07.790> head<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:09.000> ball<00:03:09.209> and<00:03:09.660> it

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
you seen a striker head the ball and it

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.110 
you seen a striker head the ball and it
just<00:03:09.860> bounces<00:03:10.860> off<00:03:11.040> his<00:03:11.220> head<00:03:11.430> and<00:03:11.459> goes<00:03:11.760> God

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
just bounces off his head and goes God

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.420 
just bounces off his head and goes God

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
knows where that barely never happens

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.520 
knows where that barely never happens
almost<00:03:14.640> always<00:03:15.330> is<00:03:15.480> going<00:03:15.690> right<00:03:16.019> in<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.350> goal

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
almost always is going right in the goal

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.009 
almost always is going right in the goal
and<00:03:16.709> almost<00:03:17.550> always<00:03:17.910> it's<00:03:18.420> right<00:03:18.690> where<00:03:18.900> the

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
and almost always it's right where the

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.380 
and almost always it's right where the
goalie<00:03:19.230> can't<00:03:19.590> get<00:03:19.799> to<00:03:20.010> it<00:03:20.040> why<00:03:20.820> did<00:03:21.060> they<00:03:21.180> make

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
goalie can't get to it why did they make

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.770 
goalie can't get to it why did they make
it<00:03:21.570> so<00:03:21.750> accurate<00:03:22.610> number<00:03:23.610> two<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:23.970> defenders

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
it so accurate number two the defenders

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.430 
it so accurate number two the defenders
they<00:03:25.739> don't<00:03:26.400> go<00:03:26.730> after<00:03:27.269> the<00:03:27.390> ball<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:27.930> way<00:03:28.110> a

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
they don't go after the ball the way a

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.229 
they don't go after the ball the way a
normal<00:03:29.160> person<00:03:29.519> will<00:03:29.610> go<00:03:29.730> after<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:30.030> ball

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
normal person will go after the ball

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.270 
normal person will go after the ball
they're<00:03:30.450> so<00:03:30.720> lackadaisical<00:03:31.260> and<00:03:31.980> they<00:03:32.100> don't

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
they're so lackadaisical and they don't

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.240 
they're so lackadaisical and they don't
care<00:03:32.610> and<00:03:32.670> whatever<00:03:33.709> it<00:03:34.709> doesn't<00:03:35.100> make<00:03:35.190> any

care and whatever it doesn't make any

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.030 
care and whatever it doesn't make any
sense<00:03:35.700> why<00:03:36.120> why<00:03:36.959> they<00:03:37.230> not<00:03:37.410> going<00:03:37.709> after<00:03:37.950> the

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040

they make a living doing this and they
just<00:03:41.400> don't<00:03:41.640> care<00:03:41.910> it's<00:03:42.720> a<00:03:42.989> bad<00:03:43.350> job<00:03:43.859> by<00:03:43.920> EA<00:03:44.459> of

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
just don't care it's a bad job by EA of

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.840 
just don't care it's a bad job by EA of
simulating<00:03:46.320> how<00:03:46.530> a<00:03:46.560> defender<00:03:47.190> would<00:03:47.370> react<00:03:47.730> to
