okay<00:00:01.290> so<00:00:01.350> let's<00:00:01.709> look<00:00:01.890> at<00:00:02.100> one<00:00:02.310> more<00:00:02.340> input

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
okay so let's look at one more input

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.950 
okay so let's look at one more input
I've<00:00:03.540> removed<00:00:04.080> the<00:00:05.120> satellite<00:00:06.120> receiver<00:00:06.540> for

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
I've removed the satellite receiver for

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.120 
I've removed the satellite receiver for
the<00:00:07.620> sake<00:00:08.099> of<00:00:08.130> room<00:00:08.460> and<00:00:09.139> put<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.349> emote<00:00:10.920> IVA

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
the sake of room and put the emote IVA

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.770 
the sake of room and put the emote IVA
ERC<00:00:11.849> one<00:00:12.540> on<00:00:12.780> top<00:00:13.259> our<00:00:13.530> CD<00:00:14.460> player<00:00:14.759> and<00:00:15.120> so

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
ERC one on top our CD player and so

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.420 
ERC one on top our CD player and so
let's<00:00:15.960> configure<00:00:16.289> an<00:00:16.500> input<00:00:16.859> for<00:00:17.070> that<00:00:17.100> also

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
let's configure an input for that also

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.540 
let's configure an input for that also
I've<00:00:18.359> gone<00:00:18.630> ahead<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:18.930> taken<00:00:19.199> my<00:00:19.560> UMC<00:00:20.160> setup

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
I've gone ahead and taken my UMC setup

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.380 
I've gone ahead and taken my UMC setup
log<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.090> I've<00:00:21.449> made<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.050> third<00:00:22.439> source<00:00:23.390> CD

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
log and I've made the third source CD

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.179 
log and I've made the third source CD
we're<00:00:24.630> going<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.840> change<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.380> name<00:00:25.590> from<00:00:25.980> the

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
we're going to change the name from the

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.029 
we're going to change the name from the
pre-configured<00:00:26.609> set<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:28.019> CD<00:00:28.439> we're<00:00:28.859> going<00:00:28.980> to

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
pre-configured set to CD we're going to

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.130 
pre-configured set to CD we're going to
make<00:00:29.160> sure<00:00:29.310> it's<00:00:29.460> visible<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:30.630> audio<00:00:30.960> is

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
make sure it's visible the audio is

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.440 
make sure it's visible the audio is
going<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.349> come<00:00:31.560> in<00:00:31.740> on<00:00:31.859> optical<00:00:32.430> one<00:00:32.700> the

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
going to come in on optical one the

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.540 
going to come in on optical one the
video<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:34.110> going<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.380> come<00:00:34.620> in<00:00:34.739> on<00:00:34.860> HDMI<00:00:35.489> too

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
video is going to come in on HDMI too

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.340 
video is going to come in on HDMI too
and<00:00:35.969> I'll<00:00:36.059> explain<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.870> in<00:00:36.989> just<00:00:37.050> a

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
and I'll explain that to you in just a

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.560 
and I'll explain that to you in just a
bit<00:00:37.380> here<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.820> rest<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.149> its<00:00:39.300> going<00:00:39.480> to

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
bit here and the rest of its going to

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.020 
bit here and the rest of its going to
stay<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.930> same<00:00:39.960> as<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.469> other<00:00:40.620> inputs<00:00:41.070> so

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
stay the same as the other inputs so

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.690 
stay the same as the other inputs so
let's<00:00:42.180> go<00:00:42.329> ahead<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.629> look<00:00:42.780> at<00:00:43.250> how<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.460> do

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
let's go ahead and look at how to do

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.529 
let's go ahead and look at how to do
that<00:00:46.700> so<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.789> first<00:00:47.820> thing<00:00:48.239> we'll<00:00:48.329> do<00:00:48.510> is

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
that so the first thing we'll do is

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.450 
that so the first thing we'll do is
we'll<00:00:48.750> take<00:00:48.930> our<00:00:49.140> remote<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.800> enter<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.250> menu

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
we'll take our remote and enter the menu

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.920 
we'll take our remote and enter the menu
go<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:51.539> setup<00:00:55.640> and<00:00:56.640> we'll<00:00:56.940> change<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.510> input

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
go to setup and we'll change the input

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:08.310 
go to setup and we'll change the input
name<00:00:58.199> on<00:00:58.469> source<00:00:58.920> 3<00:01:03.260> to<00:01:04.260> CD

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.300 

we'll<00:01:09.010> hit<00:01:09.130> return<00:01:09.550> and<00:01:09.820> go<00:01:10.150> to<00:01:10.210> input<00:01:10.690> setup

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
we'll hit return and go to input setup

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.880 
we'll hit return and go to input setup
drop<00:01:12.310> down<00:01:12.610> to<00:01:12.760> CD<00:01:13.150> there<00:01:13.420> it<00:01:13.540> is<00:01:13.710> we'll<00:01:14.710> make

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
drop down to CD there it is we'll make

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:21.570 
drop down to CD there it is we'll make
sure<00:01:14.950> it's<00:01:15.250> visible<00:01:15.460> in<00:01:15.970> our<00:01:16.840> audio<00:01:20.250> will<00:01:21.250> drop

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
sure it's visible in our audio will drop

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.720 
sure it's visible in our audio will drop
down<00:01:21.820> here<00:01:22.180> to<00:01:22.420> the<00:01:22.600> opticals<00:01:23.470> and<00:01:24.340> put

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:24.730 
down here to the opticals and put

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:32.060 
down here to the opticals and put
optical<00:01:25.240> one<00:01:25.680> as<00:01:26.680> our

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:42.410 

and<00:01:32.160> for<00:01:32.880> video<00:01:33.180> we'll<00:01:33.870> look<00:01:34.080> at<00:01:36.920> HDMI<00:01:37.920> -<00:01:41.420> the

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
and for video we'll look at HDMI - the

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.080 
and for video we'll look at HDMI - the
reason<00:01:42.660> I<00:01:43.050> have<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.650> video<00:01:43.800> input<00:01:44.460> set<00:01:44.970> to

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
reason I have the video input set to

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.020 
reason I have the video input set to
HDMI<00:01:45.240> -<00:01:45.690> is<00:01:46.230> so<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.460> this<00:01:47.610> configuration

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
HDMI - is so that in this configuration

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.140 
HDMI - is so that in this configuration
if<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:49.050> chose<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.620> CD<00:01:49.920> input<00:01:50.160> you<00:01:50.970> could

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
if you chose the CD input you could

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.110 
if you chose the CD input you could
listen<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.870> CD<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.530> watch<00:01:53.460> your

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 
listen to the CD and watch your

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.270 
listen to the CD and watch your
satellite<00:01:54.870> receivers<00:01:55.380> picture<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:56.070> if<00:01:56.190> you

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
satellite receivers picture so if you

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.440 
satellite receivers picture so if you
wanted<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.550> listen<00:01:56.910> to<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.470> CD<00:01:58.470> while<00:01:58.860> watching

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
wanted to listen to a CD while watching

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
something like that you could set it to

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.999 
something like that you could set it to
none<00:02:06.330> if<00:02:06.570> you'd<00:02:06.720> like<00:02:06.900> and<00:02:07.290> have<00:02:07.470> no<00:02:07.680> video

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
sure that the amp one trigger turns on

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:33.170 
sure that the amp one trigger turns on
and<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:25.530> EQ<00:02:25.980> mode<00:02:27.980> is<00:02:28.980> set<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.250> none<00:02:32.000> so<00:02:33.000> there

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
and the EQ mode is set to none so there

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.240 
and the EQ mode is set to none so there
you<00:02:33.360> have<00:02:33.390> it<00:02:33.540> our<00:02:34.110> first<00:02:34.470> three<00:02:34.800> inputs

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
you have it our first three inputs

blu-ray HD set and CD we'll just go

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.660 
blu-ray HD set and CD we'll just go
ahead<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.280> hook<00:02:38.370> up<00:02:38.580> our<00:02:38.790> optical<00:02:39.360> out<00:02:40.670> here

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
ahead and hook up our optical out here

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.360 
ahead and hook up our optical out here
we<00:02:41.820> are

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.290 

and<00:02:47.700> two<00:02:48.390> optical<00:02:48.870> one<00:02:49.830> in<00:02:50.129> which<00:02:50.819> is<00:02:51.060> right

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
and two optical one in which is right

00:02:51.300 --> 00:03:04.789 
and two optical one in which is right
here<00:02:57.379> and<00:02:58.379> there<00:02:58.530> you<00:02:58.650> have<00:02:58.709> it<00:03:02.569> so<00:03:03.739> now<00:03:04.739> that

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
here and there you have it so now that

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.500 
here and there you have it so now that
you've<00:03:05.040> hooked<00:03:05.250> up<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:05.670> configured<00:03:06.209> three

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
you've hooked up and configured three

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.070 
you've hooked up and configured three
units<00:03:06.900> you<00:03:07.560> can<00:03:07.830> go<00:03:08.400> in<00:03:08.610> if<00:03:09.180> you'd<00:03:09.540> like<00:03:09.750> and

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
units you can go in if you'd like and

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.150 
units you can go in if you'd like and
actually<00:03:10.680> change<00:03:12.170> the<00:03:13.170> rest<00:03:13.379> of<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.620> inputs

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
actually change the rest of the inputs

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.979 
actually change the rest of the inputs
to<00:03:14.370> not<00:03:14.580> be<00:03:14.790> visible<00:03:15.269> if<00:03:15.480> those<00:03:15.690> are<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:15.900> only

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
to not be visible if those are the only

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.830 
to not be visible if those are the only
three<00:03:16.349> inputs<00:03:16.799> you<00:03:16.950> have<00:03:17.250> and<00:03:17.640> you<00:03:18.360> use<00:03:18.629> the

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
three inputs you have and you use the

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.809 
three inputs you have and you use the
input<00:03:19.019> up<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:19.709> down<00:03:19.860> button<00:03:20.310> on<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.640> remote

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
input up and down button on the remote

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.930 
input up and down button on the remote
you<00:03:23.819> can<00:03:24.329> change<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:24.900> other<00:03:25.110> inputs

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
you can change the other inputs

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.400 
you can change the other inputs
visibility<00:03:26.940> to<00:03:27.150> off<00:03:27.299> so<00:03:27.750> that<00:03:27.780> you<00:03:27.989> don't<00:03:28.230> have

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
visibility to off so that you don't have

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.030 
visibility to off so that you don't have
to<00:03:28.590> skip<00:03:28.920> all<00:03:29.099> those<00:03:29.310> inputs<00:03:30.590> every<00:03:31.590> time<00:03:31.829> that

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
to skip all those inputs every time that

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.819 
to skip all those inputs every time that
you<00:03:32.160> go<00:03:32.579> through<00:03:32.849> just<00:03:33.269> to<00:03:33.329> choose<00:03:33.660> your<00:03:34.079> four

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
you go through just to choose your four

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.280 
you go through just to choose your four
available<00:03:35.489> your<00:03:35.879> tuner<00:03:36.360> and<00:03:36.599> the<00:03:36.780> three<00:03:37.079> that

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
available your tuner and the three that

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.430 
available your tuner and the three that
we<00:03:37.410> just<00:03:37.650> set<00:03:37.799> up<00:03:38.360> so<00:03:39.360> you<00:03:39.390> could<00:03:39.690> just<00:03:39.900> on<00:03:40.079> the

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
we just set up so you could just on the

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.520 
we just set up so you could just on the
next<00:03:40.709> input<00:03:40.890> which<00:03:41.310> would<00:03:41.519> be<00:03:41.670> source<00:03:42.150> four<00:03:42.540> we

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
next input which would be source four we

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.009 
next input which would be source four we
could<00:03:43.709> go<00:03:43.860> over<00:03:44.129> and<00:03:44.310> turn<00:03:44.519> the<00:03:44.750> visibility<00:03:45.750> to

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
could go over and turn the visibility to

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.789 
could go over and turn the visibility to
no<00:03:46.459> so<00:03:47.459> we'll<00:03:47.640> skip<00:03:48.000> that<00:03:48.060> input<00:03:48.530> every<00:03:49.530> time

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
no so we'll skip that input every time

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.250 
no so we'll skip that input every time
you<00:03:50.220> use<00:03:50.610> the<00:03:50.640> input<00:03:51.209> up<00:03:51.420> and<00:03:51.569> down<00:03:51.720> button<00:03:52.139> it

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
you use the input up and down button it

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.340 
you use the input up and down button it
will<00:03:52.350> only<00:03:52.590> select<00:03:53.420> from<00:03:54.420> those<00:03:54.630> first<00:03:54.989> four

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
will only select from those first four

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.590 
will only select from those first four
you'll<00:03:56.190> also<00:03:56.370> have<00:03:56.609> to<00:03:56.700> go<00:03:56.940> in<00:03:57.120> and<00:03:57.269> do<00:03:57.389> that

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
you'll also have to go in and do that

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.199 
you'll also have to go in and do that
for<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:57.959> remaining<00:03:59.060> inputs<00:04:01.819> and<00:04:02.819> make<00:04:03.060> those

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
for the remaining inputs and make those

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.740 
for the remaining inputs and make those
all<00:04:03.510> invisible<00:04:03.870> also<00:04:04.470> so<00:04:04.739> it'll<00:04:04.920> skip<00:04:05.190> those

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
all invisible also so it'll skip those

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.360
