00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.360
 there is no caramelized pear 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.910

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.199
 attention means recipe this I took 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.600
 a site called homemade recipe 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.490
 he is led by one of my subscribers and there was 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.289
 quite a few interesting recipes so 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.920
 that a reference to this site I will leave 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.689
 Alena also keeps a blog below on 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.480
 I will also leave a block at the bottom 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.370
 You can see it there gives advice and 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.660
 young moms and just mistress in 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.730
 In general, quite a lot of useful and 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.390
 interesting information naturally with you 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.460

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.980
 like i said cake with caramel 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.230
 pear that we need 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.760
 we should be dough and separately from us 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.760
 there must be caramel 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.750
 for the test we need you 150 grams 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.190
 butter 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.140
 I have it here here I already have it 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.989
 melted it and the children so thin 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.199
 further 150 grams of sugar I have here 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.199
 This cup and 150 grams of flour two 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.000
 eggs but for the filling that is but not for 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.250
 caramel fillings for us 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.830
 will need 30 grams of butter 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.830
 here is just a little bit of me 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:16.229
 I have 30 grams of sugar and pear here 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.630
 two crunches I cut them like this 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.759
 circles and removed the bones well and 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:26.820
 let's probably start in oil and with 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:31.590
 you pour sugar and beat it all up 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.630
 beat with a blender. 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:44.130
 to such a bright light state 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:45.990
 then add the testicles flour and be sure 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.430
 baking powder forgot to tell you about 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.430
 baking powder he is needed here too 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.140
 and beat again 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.409
 It turns out for yourself here is the dough 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.790
 now go to the camera 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.770
 Now we take the form from me. 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.110
 here is a bowl for multicooker 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.630
 in principle, they can be their oven 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.630
 bake pour there 30 grams of butter 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.220
 falling asleep sugar 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:35.200
 and put pears on top of pears 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:39.299
 lay out here and so overlap so 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.299
 pear laid out on top pour the dough 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.879
 all now bake a pie in the oven 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.129
 at a temperature of 180 degrees somewhere 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:01.230
 40 minutes and voila that's what we have 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.569
 it turns out does not seem to be on camera 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.459

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.530
