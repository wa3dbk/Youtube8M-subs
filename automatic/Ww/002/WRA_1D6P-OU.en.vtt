00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:11.460
 yahoo youtube 620 and today i show 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:13.469
 you heard a bug from gran turismo 5 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.750
 I 'm a little bit so just cost 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.470
 Three or four are terrifying things 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.470
 worn here 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:28.920
 you need the brdc lucia or celik 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:33.050
 or whatever he believes 406 lp 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.050
 me or 409 places for sure 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:43.000
 then you also have saison challenges 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:44.350
 go and in the series so 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.600
 front wheel drive series 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.399
 should choose the daytona change 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.610
 Please drive in this car if possible 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:55.269
 without oil change so that really 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:59.559
 little power has somehow 410 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:03.579
 is immediately louder in any case 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:06.490
 under 410 power points then you can 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.659
 you are that paragraph it is 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.140
 no real back is it actually 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:15.429
 A tactic continues as long as it does 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:17.350
 go behind the others and 

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:21.360
 the slow car doubles again 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.360
 your points better yours 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.929
 for the fast and your money and 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.310
 our longer you drive behind all the more 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:33.850
 more wind shadow you have us all the more 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.880
 experience gets us that 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.459
 therefore tactically driven are also the 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.229
 slower car and the slow dare 

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:45.549
 just for that but also as I said 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:47.289
 there is a bonus for this bonus because 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.819
 you drove slower than that 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:49.810
 other 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:52.509
 We see the car pulls actually 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:58.149
 very good with and if you are in 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:59.009
 wind shadow then one drives anyway 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:03.209
 more quickly 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:07.469
 The whole thing takes 25 minutes and me 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:07.469
 have the whole video here now 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:03.260
 but you see we have 239 now 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.480
 got third 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.870
 I always have 440 first place 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.590
 got and now the 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:16.230
 points of experience 23,000 points of experience 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:21.780
 that should be enough to determine if 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:27.630
 You always learn and you can 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:28.710
 keep repeating and that was 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.720
 then the bank you saw 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.830
 become third because then on 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.320
 started at the front 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.270
 so it really has to come in part 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.860
 happiness on, I was usually start 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.750
 start or are all on one 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.160
 heap 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.200
 and when they are all in a heap 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.490
 would have to animal experiments in the fourth to 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.590
 lie to the fourth rank behind it 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.830
 stay so fifth place is the belief 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.160
 I 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.300
 and if in the direction of 500 just before 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.740
 the fifth round you have to start 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.470
 the full throttle to overtake then 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.050
 he gets really nice ep for the level 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.209
 and also nice money for this 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.590
 slow carbon out and that was it 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.420
 then I say goodbye again 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.420
 me and until the next time goalie
