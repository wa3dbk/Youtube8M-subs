00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.770
 hello my name is sophie bar which I 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.099
 am a specialized teacher at the hospital 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.070
 and certified coach I will explain 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.690
 in what a children coaching is useful if 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.380
 your child is not motivated at school 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.760
 your child does not want to learn 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.250
 it weighs him to go to school 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.210
 he only works against the promise 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.090
 a reward 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.490
 these are the difficulties and situations 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.260
 difficult to manage 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.660
 why motivation is related to 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.840
 several factors the trust the 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.879
 responsibility and its environment 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.730
 motivation is a factor 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.739
 essential to success 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.280
 so what is the motivation the 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.350
 motivation is a bit like a bike 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.770
 if he's here but if we do not go up 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.770
 on it to pedal nothing happens 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.629
 there are two types of motivation the 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.359
 external motivation and motivation 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.809
 internal external motivation 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.339
 well we are on his bike but there is 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.590
 stabilizers and then there is 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.080
 someone who pushes his saddle as soon as 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.530
 these helps stops and well the bike 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:18.090
 stop it's a little bit the promise 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.060
 of you will have such bed or such video located 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.240
 this work comes this motivation 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.320
 external 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.720
 she stops with the helpers the 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.240
 internal motivation now and well there 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.710
 the cyclist pushes on his pedals it's 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.710
 he who advances the machine 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.310
 he is the master of the game it is he who 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.299
 decided 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.450
 he's responsible for what's going on 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:45.240
 that's the solution find the motivation 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.250
 internal of the afld of the child feels good 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.090
 sure eliminated the external that can be 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.220
 as important 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.860
 the bike's image shows well the 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.329
 responsibility a child or a 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.310
 teenager who does not feel 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.340
 responsible for his life and especially this 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.130
 that he is doing is not motivated 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.799
 the same way if a cyclist thinks 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.229
 to be able to descend a very steep slope 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.170
 stony came down without 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.350
 cluttered he's going to have problems well 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.260
 to know oneself is also a 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.840
 the keys to motivation finally the 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.260
 runner overtakes when he's on the 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.010
 finish line the audience the thumb 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.270
 what's going on he's completely 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.190
 galvanized by the encouragement of the 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.880
 public 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:34.430
 that's part of the motivation 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:37.250
 so what do you do but your job 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.420
 parents is just trying to go 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.920
 find this way of working 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.470
 encourage the child found the positive 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.410
 in what he does even when he misses 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.830
 things that's something that's going 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:54.380
 boost motivation because an emotion 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.030
 positive is really something that 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.940
 will push her forward 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:02.990
 whatever the subject proposed him of 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:05.240
 achievable goals makes the connection with 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.240
 what he lives in class what he learns 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.280
 in class and also what's going on in 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.480
 your life do you agree on 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.390
 medium-term projects 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.550
 it's very effective to want to 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.670
 build projects made him 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.170
 practice self assessment much more 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.480
 effective than waiting for intervention 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.900
 outside it's empowering 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.430
 finally let him have time for him while 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.050
 only 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.710
 again it's important to be able 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:36.230
 to fetch yourself the work of the 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:38.690
 coach now the div div the 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.810
 demotivation is related to factors 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.000
 underground do not know his strengths 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.580
 and its weaknesses 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.480
 always be listening to the speech 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:53.180
 negative inside I always miss this 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.400
 anyway I'm bad at maths of 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.750
 things like that the vo thi passion 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.540
 it can be there too when we are 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.700
 not aware of his physical condition 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.560
 emotional or mental for example 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.700
 melanie and she is tired she is 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.260
 does not account but she continues to 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.510
 work and in fact she loses her 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.910
 time or so victor who does not feel he 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.110
 is stressed and who can not 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.120
 do what he is doing and 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.430
 which starts again and ends with 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.130
 get upset and can not manage to 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.140
 nothing or so it's alexis who gets bored 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.180
 but he is not really aware of it 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.759
 then are to his divine spirit 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.810
 and then the concentrated steps and then my 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:28.970
 three hours doing homework 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.500
 so when the motivation is not there 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.740
 the coach will help the child or 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.889
 the teenager found his own way 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:40.910
 his own way of working to manage 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:43.130
 his time to communicate well and also to 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.580
 know how to ask for help when he has 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.150
 need 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:50.530
 in summary as you understood it the 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.530
 motivation it works
