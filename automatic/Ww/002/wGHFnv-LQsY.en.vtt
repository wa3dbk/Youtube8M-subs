00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:36.949 
christy is that's part of the reason I

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:38.320 
christy is that's part of the reason I
like<00:05:37.159> him<00:05:37.310> is<00:05:37.430> about<00:05:37.610> the<00:05:37.699> vice<00:05:37.849> presidential

will<00:05:41.690> have<00:05:41.840> his<00:05:41.960> time<00:05:42.169> but<00:05:42.380> I<00:05:42.409> think<00:05:42.710> Marco

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
will have his time but I think Marco

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.300

Rubio<00:05:43.610> Florida<00:05:44.570> I<00:05:44.780> just<00:05:45.560> think<00:05:45.710> he's<00:05:45.860> a<00:05:45.889> rock

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 
Rubio Florida I just think he's a rock

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:48.550 
Rubio Florida I just think he's a rock
star<00:05:46.340> I<00:05:46.760> mean<00:05:47.000> he<00:05:47.150> sounds<00:05:47.630> like<00:05:47.690> Reagan<00:05:48.260> to<00:05:48.409> me

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560
