overlooked<00:00:15.029> so<00:00:15.209> I<00:00:15.270> mean<00:00:15.740> it's<00:00:16.740> with<00:00:17.010> growth<00:00:17.340> I

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
overlooked so I mean it's with growth I

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.700 
overlooked so I mean it's with growth I
think<00:00:17.850> is<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.450> reason<00:00:18.660> why<00:00:18.960> you<00:00:19.020> see<00:00:19.350> so<00:00:19.560> much

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
think is the reason why you see so much

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.580

kids are coming in today looking at the

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.240 
kids are coming in today looking at the
business<00:00:51.000> side<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.450> what<00:00:52.200> their<00:00:52.710> skills<00:00:53.070> could

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
business side of what their skills could

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.620 
business side of what their skills could
provide<00:00:53.550> for<00:00:53.730> them<00:00:53.880> instead<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.210> looking<00:00:54.510> at

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:54.630 
provide for them instead of looking at

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.270 
provide for them instead of looking at
what<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.960> game<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.350> going<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.649> platform<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.219> I

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
what the game is going to platform so I

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.630 
what the game is going to platform so I
mean<00:00:57.530> it's<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.649> lot<00:00:58.770> more<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.130> that<00:00:59.250> but<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.520> think

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
mean it's a lot more of that but I think

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.450 
mean it's a lot more of that but I think
that<00:00:59.969> it's<00:01:00.390> unfair<00:01:00.809> because<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.379> mean<00:01:01.530> it's

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
that it's unfair because I mean it's

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.650 
that it's unfair because I mean it's
tough<00:01:02.670> pressure<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.120> they<00:01:03.239> have<00:01:03.360> to<00:01:03.480> deal

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
tough pressure that they have to deal

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.479 
tough pressure that they have to deal
with<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.079> we<00:01:04.379> never<00:01:04.649> had<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.979> deal<00:01:05.189> with<00:01:05.339> that

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
with and we never had to deal with that

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.489 
with and we never had to deal with that
and<00:01:05.819> they've<00:01:06.240> done<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.479> good<00:01:06.719> job<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.229> still
