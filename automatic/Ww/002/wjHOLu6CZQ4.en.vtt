00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:15.580
 and very good to all I am fury I bring you 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.930
 the information of what the 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.470
 update that came out a couple of 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:23.140
 days and it's very important worth the first 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.310
 a fact without much importance is that 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.470
 weapons that we have on the wall 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.840
 apart from telling us the name of the weapon and 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.510
 what it costs have also included a 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.280
 small weapon icon if we can see the 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.379
 weapon for example now you are going to see me 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.790
 I approach here and it is available then in 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:38.320
 all the maps in all the maps of 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.350
 zombies any weapon in the 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.330
 wall we will get this icon then the most 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.530
 important that they have included for me is 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:49.239
 that now indie rice we have a refrigerator 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.129
 but in the translation it comes out as a wardrobe 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.979
 but good is the fridge that we had in 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.700
 transit to save and remove 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:57.680
 plus 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.900
 as you know in trance and we had a 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.090
 fridge here we also have that fridge 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.520
 that is in this location and if by 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.070
 example we mediate a galil or a galil 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:10.730
 improved in a game we could 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.620
 save and use in another game and 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.440
 right here behind in these showers 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.780
 here is to remove and shower the 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.340
 left is to deposit this is the 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.900
 bank that the new bank that we have 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.750
 available in di rice 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.820
 both the fridge and the eddie bank 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.590
 Wright with transit are communicated 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.210
 say all the money that we put into the 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.670
 transit bank we can take it end and 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.980
 rise and everything we put in this rise 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.490
 we can remove it in transit through the 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.890
 list of achievements and trophies that I raised in the 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.840
 previous video is confirmed that in 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.420
 buried we will also have a bank and a 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.130
 fridge this is very important since 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.980
 right now I'm doing a 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.360
 lots of points to put them here in 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.910
 the rise that is easier is more to me 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.490
 easy to make points for when we have 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.350
 the map of buried start with a lot 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.470
 of points to be able to open the whole map and 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.119
 explore it freely and if I can then I 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.240
 I'm going to put an improved weapon here 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:09.240
 example the galil because to see I explain 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.120
 here on land and we have the a in 94 and 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.400
 the vw for example that in transit as not 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.959
 we have it available what will be the 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.700
 fridge is changing a being arm by 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.970
 example if here in the rise we put a 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.160
 to 94 enter would be a 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.560
 galil because they come in if we do not have an already 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.500
 gives us a similar weapon and if we put a 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.310
 pw here in the rise come in being 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.709
 I would leave 1 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.630
 that is, they are the most similar as in 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.940
 buried we do not know what weapons we're going to 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.490
 have available or not 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.520
 well I'm going to try to put 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.320
 a galil or an improved gallery and there 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.810
 well the most important thing I'm going to do 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.270
 is to put a lot of points for 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.490
 can collect them in buried and open 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.420
 the doors and all this so this is 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.120
 what they bring us this new 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.710
 very important update and this 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.290
 Tuesday we will have the map of buried 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.610
 I'll do if I can a live show and a lot of 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.740
 videos with all the information you can 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.820
 bring from that new map and I hope that you 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.320
 have liked and see you in the next 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.320
 video until next time
