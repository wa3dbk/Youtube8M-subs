00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:09.880
 That is how the process while connecting seam allowances close cloth 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:16.119
 You'll see a different form of performance. 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:20.609
 If you are ready to stitch the seam allowance to between 1.5 As you can see, 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.609
 This pushes haejusimyeon ready 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.739
 Oh yes 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.570
 I'll start with one side . 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:16.370
 When you started well, you certainly endured your class until the end. 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.020
 c5 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.440
 Turn it around and turn it 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.960
 Attach 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:08.380
 Oh, you see now, you cut one side only . 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.380
 In this case, when mercy 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:17.090
 I'm down to one side . 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.090
 The next form 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.680
 Oon 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.450
 Ah 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.730
 I'll cut the r2 texture to the real one. 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.099
 U 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.420
 Ah 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:31.520
 Ah 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:36.380
 As you can see , one side is the incision on both sides . 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:39.440
 One side incised down one side. 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:44.870
 In this case, 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:48.230
 If I cut both of them, 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:55.840
 It is transformed into c- type . 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:58.100
 If you do this, only one incision is re-jumbo by driving back and forth to see Caesar 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.320
 Push it down 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.320
 In the next direction 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:10.110
 Wu will be something to consider this question again 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:27.590
 Likewise, 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.810
 Ah 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:41.740
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:48.340
 Ah 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:49.389
 As you can see, you can cut off the beginning of the poem . 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.680
 Molly 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:59.410
 I will divide it and pray for adultery. 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:05:03.120
 Now the thing indeyo Boise curve curves so well gave back inlay rolling 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:05.180
 If you started to split up . 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:11.510
 next 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:13.940
 After the curved line, I was able to drive all of the seam 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:18.220
 outside 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.220
 This is the situation once again .
