00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.830
 welcome to Italian home cooking 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:11.440
 tonight we prepare lentils with 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.870
 radicchio many do not like lentils 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.700
 because they only eat proven boiled meats 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.780
 to do so and you will want to 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.039
 eat 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:27.099
 not only in the New Year tritiamo garlic 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:30.580
 onion rather fine and then cut 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:38.320
 also the radicchio that 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:41.770
 naturally I washed we put to 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.460
 brown the vegetables in a saucepan with 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.460
 little oil 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.930
 when you see the radicchio e 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.210
 withering the onion begins to 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:59.489
 reason 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.489
 add the naturally drained lentils 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.180
 It is important that he pushed it to have a 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.909
 nice bottom often because the networks that 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:19.470
 they must cook very slowly now 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:23.940
 add vegetable stock or if not 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:29.250
 you have water and vegetable stock 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:30.630
 cover flush and let boil until 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.600
 when the lentils will be 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.270
 soften when you see them 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.450
 lentils are cooked ie tender but not 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.850
 crushed we add the extract of 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.780
 tomato that serves to give flavor and 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:52.229
 lentils color the equivalent of 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:54.509
 a generous spoon you see that with a 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.630
 about spoon of tomato extract 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:06.390
 the color has already become high already 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:09.869
 best more lively when the extract of 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.950
 tomato blended well and you see that 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:16.320
 lentils are dry a brodose 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.560
 it will be time to serve them and bring them 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.560
 on the table 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.280
 I particularly like to serve the 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.450
 lentils in the bowl maybe 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.769
 accompanying them with a leaf of 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:35.280
 radicchio that tells what they are 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:38.209
 stay with the kitchen appetite 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.209
