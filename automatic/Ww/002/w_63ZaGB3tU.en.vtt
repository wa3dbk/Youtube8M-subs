00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.510
 hello everyone with you kate valentine and you 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.759
 Watch the 7th episode of the girls in. 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.549
 games in which I tell all the most 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.470
 interesting about girls video games today 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.960
 I will tell you immediately about the two heroines of them 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.930
 a series of games portal after all speaking a Glados 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:26.310
 not to mention the bodies and vice versa 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:27.150
 so let's start the portal genre puzzle from 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.250
 first person 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.650
 there is hardly a person who is not 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.989
 heard and did not see these games therefore not 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.320
 I will go deep and recalled that the first 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:41.219
 the game was released in 2007 and the second after four 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.520
 years in 2011 the plot of these games is built on 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.379
 standoff person and degree 1 experimental 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.070
 girl who wants to get out 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.190
 laboratories 2 out of control 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.500
 supercomputer 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.829
 endowed with self-awareness and desire 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.480
 conduct tests 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.550
 pride was developed by a corporation 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.809
 purchase and if research laboratories 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.390
 nature portals 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.309
 her name is an abbreviation which 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.590
 stands for life gene tag 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.720
 form of Indian operating systems viz. 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.619
 genetic life form and disk 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.600
 operating system 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.340
 in addition to its core module glados 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.299
 has another spherical module 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.009
 personalities 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.320
 but these components are not 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.750
 mandatory portal 2 chad 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.710
 existed without them working will deprive 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.740
 potato battery in games we were 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.659
 the following modules are shown 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.990
 curiosity intellect and morality emotions in 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.210
 1 and the adventures of space mitigation 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.659
 intelligence better known as this 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.659
 2 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.270
 cynical onion broadcasts le dos during 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.060
 Her first run took over 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.460
 Laboratory management has destroyed almost 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.520
 all the staff and arranged endless 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.770
 test cycle which got ccell but 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.990
 it does not bother the fate of people 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.240
 and for nothing she won first place in 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:06.430
 ranking of the top 100 computer villains 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:08.920
 games compiled by the portal egen in both 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.960
 plays Glados voiced opera singer 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.900
 ellen maclane and the whole gameplay 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.010
 accompanied by caustic comments 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:26.580
 supercomputer designed to touch 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:26.580
 the feelings of the people running the panda son 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:40.790
 import to the bottom to the 8th other line he 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:45.519
 expects and is smother is far more clear both 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.519
 I might intend to trouble melei 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.530
 the girl is unlike all eyes 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.989
 the game did not utter a word but it is not 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.060
 It means that it is possible to mute person 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.610
 refused to speak so as not to give was 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.829
 and dos satisfaction with your answer though 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.500
 even the fuss at the beginning of the second part she 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:05.599
 speaks exclusively by jumping but 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.069
 this can be explained by the state of shock 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.069
 after a long anabiosis 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.390
 and on you exactly dislike 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.970
 to see how a person sees will have 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.370
 still try while creating and 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.900
 models as a prototype 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.150
 Alice's face glue was used 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.540
 who gave her looks also 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:30.629
 angry if shoots 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.380
 cel a young girl 20 25 years her name 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:34.480
 never sounds in the game but 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.860
 on it in the closing credits and maybe 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.810
 found in game files 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.720
 ethnic roots rather than 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.710
 ambiguously maybe she 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.700
 Hispanic or multi racial 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.010
 of origin 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.200
 since the people are silent all the time of character and 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.420
 and learn is not so easy a little 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.230
 Information can be gleaned from comics 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.930
 portal 2 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.540
 labret where part of the personal was shown 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.610
 affairs what it says she is 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.590
 bulk stubborn and refuses 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:04.160
 give up no matter how serious was not 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.530
 the problem was originally what it was 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.750
 rejected as a test subject so not 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.120
 was the fastest and most sporting of 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:14.000
 list but one of the staff is pepper 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.430
 Saenz has repeatedly challenged it correctly 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 judging that the extreme persistence of people can 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.519
 allow 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.650
 and defeat Glados based on achievements 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.840
 taught in games it can be assumed that 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.880
 the girl is very resourceful and can 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.410
 creative approach to solving problems 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.410
 instead of panicking 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.910
 she managed to outwit playlo with the end 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.040
 the first part and many years later from 5 to 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.350
 tens of thousands after partial 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.389
 the laboratories destruction the cel awakens 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.790
 from anabiosis and whether there is a module 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:53.150
 includes our second heroine 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:55.220
 because in the second half of the game is smooth 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.650
 began to become friends by misfortune 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.330
 together they make their way through the old 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.030
 laboratories to stop 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.039
 gone too far to control leave then 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.150
 it turns out that the plagas was moved 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:07.490
 mind carol 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.360
 assistant laboratory founder you 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.360
 his johnson 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.729
 in the past little is also known 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.850
 some information to share 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:20.289
 big question can you believe the words 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:23.080
 for example, she claims that the person was 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:25.389
 thrown at birth with exactly 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.669
 It is known waiting for the daughter of a scientist and and 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:30.220
 exhibits are at the exhibition accept for sure 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:32.440
 the work before that you can establish that what 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:35.050
 was school age when held 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.889
 exhibition this means that she was born in 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.889
 90s 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:44.370
 there is an opinion that she is the daughter of Johnson 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.740
 and Caroline is an assistant scientist and 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.900
 people look like this is it really 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.420
 case with confidence can not say 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:55.140
 no one except the developers but such 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:57.570
 version takes place to be in the end 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:00.330
 Glados saves people and releases it from 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:02.670
 complex however there is a theory that 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.770
 cel dies at the end of the second portal and 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:07.470
 it is tied in ancient greek 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.380
 mythology the Greeks believed that after death 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.550
 man hears beautiful music 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.950
 transferred to the wheat field and 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:17.220
 meets a deceased old friend or 

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:19.530
 Relatives and people first sees the choir 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.390
 the turret is then selected on the field where 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:24.270
 burned out days 

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:26.250
 companion cube maybe glados which 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:29.190
 lied to people for two games 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:31.530
 deceived and and when she said she lets go 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:33.720
 but personally I would not like to think so 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:35.910
 if only because people wish in ancient 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.640
 Greece and the mythology of that world are unlikely to 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:40.290
 not applicable 

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:42.690
 on this i finish my tale of two 

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:45.240
 the main characters of the port series ah and by 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:47.490
 traditions are a bit positive in the foreseeable 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.620
 the future we will have another meeting with 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:52.090
 them in noncommercial short 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:53.949
 cartoon based on the game 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:56.169
 a movie called companion spike though 

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:58.240
 fan on done by a professional so 

00:06:56.169 --> 00:07:00.729
 as the first news about him appeared in 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.889
 April last year apparently work 

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:05.229
 it is not moving very fast but 

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:08.070
 If you believe the poster can be expected 

00:07:05.229 --> 00:07:08.070
 already this year
