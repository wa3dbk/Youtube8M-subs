00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.230 
see the side blade is fully balanced in

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.140 
see the side blade is fully balanced in
the<00:01:33.410> middle<00:01:33.680> because<00:01:33.860> when<00:01:34.250> I<00:01:34.280> tap<00:01:34.730> on<00:01:35.000> the

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
sides

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.990 
sides
watch<00:01:36.650> this<00:01:37.000> here<00:01:38.000> and<00:01:38.500> it<00:01:39.500> will<00:01:39.620> come<00:01:39.950> back<00:01:40.220> do

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
watch this here and it will come back do

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.610 
watch this here and it will come back do
you<00:01:41.090> see<00:01:41.120> that<00:01:42.970> what<00:01:45.370> can<00:01:46.370> you<00:01:46.460> see<00:01:46.670> that<00:01:47.620> is

you see that what can you see that is

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.120 
you see that what can you see that is
keep<00:01:49.040> going<00:01:49.090> up<00:01:50.090> and<00:01:50.450> down<00:01:50.780> that<00:01:50.840> means<00:01:51.260> your

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
keep going up and down that means your

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.670 
keep going up and down that means your
blade<00:01:52.400> is<00:01:52.580> really<00:01:53.570> well-balanced<00:01:54.170> so<00:01:54.470> I

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
blade is really well-balanced so I

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.040 
blade is really well-balanced so I
bought<00:01:55.010> this<00:01:55.190> blade<00:01:55.550> and<00:01:55.880> I<00:01:56.270> don't<00:01:56.570> have<00:01:56.780> to<00:01:56.930> do

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
bought this blade and I don't have to do

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.870 
bought this blade and I don't have to do
anything<00:01:57.380> because<00:01:57.740> it's<00:01:58.040> fully<00:01:58.370> balanced<00:01:58.760> if

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
anything because it's fully balanced if

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.590 
anything because it's fully balanced if
I<00:01:59.000> tip<00:01:59.240> here<00:01:59.510> watch<00:02:00.580> and<00:02:01.580> that<00:02:02.180> should<00:02:02.390> not

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
I tip here watch and that should not

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.950 
I tip here watch and that should not
stop<00:02:02.840> keep<00:02:03.320> going<00:02:03.350> up<00:02:03.740> and<00:02:03.860> down<00:02:04.100> you<00:02:04.280> know<00:02:04.310> and

stop keep going up and down you know and

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.100 
stop keep going up and down you know and
if<00:02:05.960> if<00:02:06.920> you<00:02:07.220> stop<00:02:07.730> one<00:02:07.970> side<00:02:08.270> you<00:02:08.480> just<00:02:08.540> put<00:02:08.929> the

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
if if you stop one side you just put the

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.670 
if if you stop one side you just put the
tip<00:02:09.350> on<00:02:09.619> it<00:02:09.649> and<00:02:10.160> this<00:02:11.060> balance<00:02:11.660> of<00:02:11.840> so<00:02:12.440> better

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
tip on it and this balance of so better

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.670 
tip on it and this balance of so better
then<00:02:12.920> go<00:02:13.160> like<00:02:13.400> a<00:02:13.430> technically<00:02:14.420> use<00:02:15.050> other
