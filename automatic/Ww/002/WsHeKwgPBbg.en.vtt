more<00:02:49.159> rough<00:02:49.340> around<00:02:49.519> the<00:02:49.639> edges<00:02:49.730> but<00:02:50.450> I<00:02:50.510> guess

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
weight of the servers all that crap but

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:55.990 
weight of the servers all that crap but
