 I have a parapet not just to ask. 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.820
 What is the use of a vegetable garden? 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.440
 a vertical 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.690
 Look what a beautiful thing these vases 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.760
 tapered after the plant grows these 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.289
 of pending growth begin to 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.460
 hide the vase and you will have a 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.750
 whole wall edible verdigris and 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.309
 scented delicious 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.199
 Look at this lavender, what a beautiful thing. 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.329
 imagine her full of flowers 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.660
 here we have thyme eyes 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.220
 took on the most delicate things with 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.300
 to touch it already comes with a smell 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.670
 tasty 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.070
 So today I went to you to make a 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.400
 these empty oregano but serves to 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.290
 several species are pending and this 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.690
 time the planting just a little bit different 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.090
 because we do not want to put a 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.759
 another seed we want 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.070
 overpopulation people want to complain 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.030
 they grow beautiful and occupy the vase 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.549
 Then there 's a whole little bag, okay? 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.439
 the pot can be clay plastic possession 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.020
 no matter since it has holes 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.119
 train already enters water empoÃ§a reminds 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.520
 vessel assembly is very similar to the 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.140
 that we taught in other videos if 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.960
 You lose, have a look at the videos. 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.810
 previous of our webseries my garden 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.380
 here is the small package that we 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.930
 Let's populate that way. 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.820
 they are as small as grains of 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.890
 salt 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:02.670
 with just one layer of earth per 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:07.100
 up a nothing and there keep the whole kid 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.570
 very wet especially on the days of 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.280
 seeding 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.610
 in previous videos we talked a lot 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.080
 of the need for the sun for the gardens, right? 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.910
 In the case of balconies, 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.310
 to be sunny in 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.530
 abundance so you do not have to 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.080
 to be carrying both because the vessels 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.099
 resect you can use a highlight the 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.830
 easy watering 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:31.590
 besides being a good hand on the wheel 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.640
 he also adapts bottles of various 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.950
 sizes 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.190

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.690
 wait for him in the vase you want to keep 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.630
 solution is also attached to the 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.360
 Who usually travels very carefully? 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.000
 you punch in the bottle 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.740
 need not be great with time to 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.120
 plant will end up hiding it will 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.820
 stay camouflaged they will be 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.680
 always beautiful nobody will know how 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:58.710
