00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 the skoda power packs has today 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.810
 I'll tell you personally 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.130
 See here for wind fire below 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.960
 in the video description a link from 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.679
 the uefa where could vote just yet 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.089
 again as a team often you should look there 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.710
 are just the nominated games 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.390
 listed and you can yours 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.800
 represent team and contains there 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.189
 send and they will look at each other 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.990
 and then it 'll be easy, I'll tell you 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.480
 agree with one or the other of you 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.849
 I say something new or different 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.180
 players who wanted to stay here fire 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.070
 Now I start here with the herbs 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:39.170
 Actually only one person can 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.170
 I have not even said that 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:53.449
 published in the right fifa 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:53.449
 when I create with a self 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:23.069
 less synonymous with those mini players 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.640
 then continue with the right 

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:25.920
 defender 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.500
 actually a right defender of 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.390
 was formerly philipp lahm philipp 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.880
 Lahm is now under the control of Pep 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:38.250
 guardiola has changed as six eyes 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:40.619
 as a memorial that the uefa will that 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.869
 system no idea who that 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.310
 has stops short of I transition times that they 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.780
 philipp lame has in the right 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.479
 defense silent because philipp is lame 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.409
 just in the mass here too 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.409
 put 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.420
 teleplan had an incredible 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.820
 are therefore called for world champion 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.950
 at bayern always solid and correct 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.929
 strong part I made it very much 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.890
 strongly believe that philipp lame as 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:10.630
 right defender receives as zdf the 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.760
 week here goes to all goes on 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.160
 with the first vacation that is 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.620
 namely a Spaniard came a team friends 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.700
 are in there today is then namely 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.819
 sergio ramos 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.300
 camus just has the champions league 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.700
 won 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.410
 last year was the last year it was 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.140
 I believe in atletico madrid 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.150
 his head and I think that at 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.739
 Real Madrid makes you solid 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.090
 services actually bought philipp 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.760
 lame I think ramos stands 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.160
 almost every year that he actually 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.080
 will be built car this year which is 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.019
 not for nothing that 87er valuation 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.730
 in fifa 15 but let's go on 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.799
 here to another in pattaya 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.090
 We have mats hummels for a seat 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.920
 actually there you can argue 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.049
 actually be what you want to come 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.239
 not guaranteed, but I say that 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:57.630
 times come to 1 1 because you can tell me 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.160
 what you want but I think it's about 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.380
 85 percent of 100 percent of it 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.690
 that mats hummels in seven at sea 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.700
 actually get in it 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.590
 Of course, 70 ps is real ice 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.750
 working high medium bothers me 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.120
 but it's still on 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.859
 I think in my opinion 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.780
 mats hummels has also said as with 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:18.880
 germany brought the world championship 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.220
 So I think I think so 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.989
 as I said so I guess also 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.100
 that many German players stand 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.930
 would and not already in the last 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.750
 years always the spanier say I like 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.250
 him first cd what the all and pique 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.769
 Last year, I still believe in it 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.840
 was the penultimate year was definitely 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:38.049
 piquet always inside daniel's city 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.060
 also more often inside left defender 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.920
 there is one of bavaria again 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.630
 that was all , it was half too 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.010
 Austrian chess player of the year 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.650
 I think that this is him 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.480
 this year will be in here, too 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.310
 so definitely nominated i even know 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.780
 not which other parties nominated 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.519
 is like I said if you want to see 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.260
 just look below in the video 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.389
 description that's why link david says 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.699
 alaba see when you see the values 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:02.199
 provides as a team to back people 

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:03.560
 one really knows just scream now 

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:05.510
 everything over 18 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.220
 minimum and a few will turn silver over 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.930
 90 pace today I think about 90 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.690
 Darling maybe too to fit almost 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:15.290
 90 Come on in any case my 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.570
 second here to midfield as 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.760
 first other repeatedly halt halt 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.940
 At heat third important all games 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.139
 also made with humans is one 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.700
 had difficult start but if you 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.950
 who are looking at it 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.360
 marie simply instructions artist and 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.760
 talent I say 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.590
 that's why we have to work here in the team 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.360
 on in here are angel di maria 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.460
 with 90 probably no idea what he knows 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.710
 still a lot of speed to get 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.930
 already team on player like i said 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.750
 think that the speed thresholds 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.330
 but it goes on with the 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:50.660
 second set because you get a real grenade 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.919
 namely yaya touré yaya touré every 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.900
 actually played really well 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:54.889
 But every year he was not in the team 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.840
 on series in it 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:59.000
 this is actually the just is 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.100
 People always talk really good 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.050
 brought but stood as I said 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.940
 never in team austria i think so 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.130
 This year will be finally because 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.870
 the nests are not gone now 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.990
 nominated and that's why I think 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.890
 place for the maria and yes so and 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.440
 then we come to the last one 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:17.270
 midfielder next to not arjen 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.950
 Crows of the last season right 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.690
 a properly dotted too 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.940
 at the wm we arise from that 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.860
 by a current just 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.950
 he also has 42 here 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:30.800
 as you can see 91 92 and I think 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:33.190
 times the Chinese wanted them and 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:36.530
 Team from the player I guess 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:39.500
 what have i give you 95/96 rating 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:42.289
 I believe 95 will definitely be 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.060
 the really big values have almost 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:45.950
 as big a player as Ronaldo 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.410
 actually and all only with left foot 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.720
 not then it goes on with the 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:52.370
 right wing players back in 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.169
 Germany I have said against it 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:57.110
 I packed a lot of german ring because 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:58.490
 I guess this will be just positive 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.380
 because Germany has brought the wm 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.900
 I also think that many Germans 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:05.180
 player would stand in it 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.860
 no one wants lame me up here 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.260
 every case continues with thomas 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.940
 ruhl be pending make right wing 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.620
 you here 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.900
 thomas müller also has an in shape 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.020
 come and thomas müller had the wm 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:20.830
 also outstanding with iron the whole 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:25.790
 all over Germany played outstanding 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:27.320
 a leitner force finally and he 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.400
 I think I'll run too 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.280
 how many times I say here, I guess 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.450
 I guess I think I'm interested 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.250
 I'm not going to that 

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:36.860
 vote and there can only one 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:40.310
 stand and that is leonel messi 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:43.010
 people also have an eternal braker card 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:45.470
 we get so many gates then makes 

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:48.710
 I hang him as a team of the 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:50.960
 year card 99er rating 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.970
 because I just have to be the best of me 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.260
 be back and is actually also the 

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:59.960
 best player is actually said that way 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:07:01.640
 almost my favorite leo messi think 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.860
 I times that a new rating gets 

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:05.600
 if not at least 1 819 rating but 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.670
 i think even 19 rating because one 

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.480
 contract with the rtc you know 

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:10.100
 decision 

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.510
 Now continue with the left 

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.730
 wingplayers and never mind 

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.690
 actually a team on the already 

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:16.520
 half clear 

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:18.170
 in my opinion here christian all 

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:23.350
 pattern also has a form 

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:26.840
 so far had to go 89 92 tempo 

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:27.980
 messi 19 dribbling just like you do 

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.870
 So actually, the two 

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.850
 players alright now if they are 98 

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:33.290
 few names 990 few actually in 

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:35.000
 both play important in any case 

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:37.160
 something here with my team here 

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.720
 Here you can have your team had here 

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.950
 write in the comments 

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.570
 that would be very interesting to me 

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.820
 and then I thank you for watching 

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:45.770
 that was the little friday special video 

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:49.460
