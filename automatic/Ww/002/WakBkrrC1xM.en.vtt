00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.260
 Hey 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.610
 good guys this new story today 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.170
 we will do summer paradise by simple plan 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.820
 a song you asked me to 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.040
 so many that I wanted to do for a long time because 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.090
 it was fucking and then it ca n't be 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.949
 to play these songs 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.640
 everyone will know it is not so difficult 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.210
 if we make the facilitated agreements there is 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.580
 just a bar 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:15.400
 and yes minor ok we can do it ease 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.920
 then let's start with my king 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.090
 greater 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.439
 the greater the smaller of money 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.439
 ok four bodies 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.950
 according to this century rate of 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.689
 first cooked third finger on the third the 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.400
 second door rate comeback on 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.880
 first key of the score 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.460
 but greater 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:51.620
 first second defined the century 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.620
 rate of the second third and fourth string 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:14.080
 ok he was then forgotten by synesis but three cd's 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.670
 and minor services 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:20.980
 this is the similar facilitated tav 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.660
 then pan put the first finger on the 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.310
 first on the key on the secondary of the 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:31.740
 first string to play the strong point 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.740
 because you feel that then 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.600
 the effect will be almost the same then 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.600
 we have the G major 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.910
 that the fourth finger on the football button 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.250
 of the first rope fucking liter on the third 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.290
 key of the last miss rope 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.520
 economic on the second rate of life 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.850
 rope 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.850
 Dear 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:09.470
 then ok let's move on to the pre chorus 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.470
 so we sign 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.750
 but me 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.700
 so this part minox the minors 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.819
 money 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.269
 renault and greater 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.269
 then again 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:32.630
 the boys are more it goes from soul to 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.720
 does sharps then 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.720
 Hello 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.660
 in fact it exists 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.640
 we can make this easier 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.290
 so this is the stage of doing nothing 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.030
 we ca n't make it easier 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.090
 I will make the simplified agreement of the fact 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.069
 that you make sure then the key 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.640
 head to the first finger on the crude themselves 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.640
 with the rope 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.220
 and then the refrain 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:16.780
 then what we see here then the 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:21.030
 refrain consists of three parts then 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.030
 son red ila 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:33.999
 ok you know what we do yes the less is the 

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:33.999
 faster fast ok repeats sun dela 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:38.589
 OK then 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.230
 Go 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:59.420
 only surrender and then we do less than e 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.420
 we repeat solve the 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:13.800
 but guys the rhythm like in the tutorial 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:19.680
 previous is almost equal in the sense that 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:21.330
 we do then do a picking 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.960
 plan 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:27.409
 and then it doesn't have a strong then we stop 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.409
 and we repeat 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.930
 so this is quite easy but 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:06.680
 and then inspection 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:06.680
