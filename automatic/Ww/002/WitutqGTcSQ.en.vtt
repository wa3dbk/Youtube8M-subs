00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
it's very light I must say it doesn't

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.250 
it's very light I must say it doesn't
look<00:00:44.670> like<00:00:44.700> it's<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.239> light<00:00:45.510> but<00:00:45.780> once<00:00:46.110> you

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
look like it's that light but once you

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.470 
look like it's that light but once you
pick<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.620> up<00:00:46.680> in<00:00:46.890> your<00:00:46.920> hands<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.550> monitor<00:00:48.210> is

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
pick it up in your hands this monitor is

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.650 
pick it up in your hands this monitor is
quite<00:00:48.899> light<00:00:49.140> even<00:00:49.950> with<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.250> stand<00:00:50.660> and

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
quite light even with the stand and

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.630 
quite light even with the stand and
another<00:00:52.590> thing<00:00:52.829> right<00:00:53.010> off<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.219> bat<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.610> that

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
another thing right off the bat is that

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.360 
another thing right off the bat is that
the<00:00:54.149> bezel<00:00:54.600> it's<00:00:55.199> not<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.590> thinnest<00:00:56.010> but<00:00:56.280> I'd

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
the bezel it's not the thinnest but I'd

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.510 
the bezel it's not the thinnest but I'd
have<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.550> say<00:00:57.260> it's<00:00:58.260> pretty<00:00:58.590> thin<00:00:58.890> compared<00:00:59.430> to

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
have to say it's pretty thin compared to

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.000 
have to say it's pretty thin compared to
some<00:00:59.760> other<00:01:00.030> screens<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.629> I've<00:01:00.780> seen<00:01:01.079> but<00:01:01.680> it

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
some other screens that I've seen but it

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.420 
some other screens that I've seen but it
could<00:01:02.460> have<00:01:02.850> been<00:01:03.120> better<00:01:03.500> in<00:01:04.500> terms<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:05.070> how

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
could have been better in terms of how

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.670 
could have been better in terms of how
thin<00:01:05.790> they<00:01:06.030> made<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.390> bezel<00:01:06.750> but<00:01:06.869> again<00:01:07.530> you

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
thin they made the bezel but again you

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.460 
thin they made the bezel but again you
do<00:01:07.860> get<00:01:08.070> what<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.310> pay<00:01:08.340> for<00:01:08.820> for<00:01:09.290> $149<00:01:10.290> it's

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
do get what you pay for for $149 it's

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.910 
do get what you pay for for $149 it's
quite<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.830> bargain<00:01:12.290> let's<00:01:13.290> head<00:01:13.470> straight<00:01:13.650> into

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
quite a bargain let's head straight into

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.820 
quite a bargain let's head straight into
the<00:01:14.070> specifications<00:01:15.000> ok<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.990> screen<00:01:16.259> size<00:01:16.530> as

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
the specifications ok the screen size as

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.510 
the specifications ok the screen size as
I<00:01:16.950> stated<00:01:17.250> before<00:01:17.369> is<00:01:17.869> 21.5<00:01:18.869> inches<00:01:19.520> the

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
I stated before is 21.5 inches the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.640 
I stated before is 21.5 inches the
backlight<00:01:21.030> technology<00:01:21.659> uses<00:01:22.080> as<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.409> said

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
backlight technology uses as I said

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.859 
backlight technology uses as I said
before<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:23.070> LED<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:24.180> can<00:01:24.330> watch<00:01:24.479> one<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.689> my

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
before is LED you can watch one of my

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.210 
before is LED you can watch one of my
other<00:01:25.049> videos<00:01:25.200> where<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:25.740> explain<00:01:25.770> the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
other videos where I explain the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.200 
other videos where I explain the
difference<00:01:26.549> between<00:01:26.640> LED<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.630> LCD<00:01:28.640> okay<00:01:29.670> the

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
difference between LED and LCD okay the

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.440 
difference between LED and LCD okay the
a<00:01:30.240> downside<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.350> this<00:01:31.560> monitor<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.549> it

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
a downside to this monitor is that it

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.410 
a downside to this monitor is that it
around<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.530> back<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:35.070> does<00:01:35.369> only<00:01:35.670> have<00:01:35.790> one

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
around the back it does only have one

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.140 
around the back it does only have one
VGA<00:01:37.020> port<00:01:37.439> but<00:01:37.650> that's<00:01:37.860> not<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.610> big<00:01:38.909> of<00:01:39.030> a

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
VGA port but that's not that big of a

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.740 
VGA port but that's not that big of a
deal<00:01:39.329> if<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.720> don't<00:01:39.750> mind<00:01:40.400> anyway<00:01:41.400> but<00:01:42.329> again

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
deal if you don't mind anyway but again

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.139 
deal if you don't mind anyway but again
you<00:01:42.899> do<00:01:43.110> get<00:01:43.320> what<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.560> pay<00:01:43.590> for<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:44.850> height

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
you do get what you pay for the height

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.929 
you do get what you pay for the height
is<00:01:45.479> 16<00:01:46.259> inches<00:01:46.770> with<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.399> stand<00:01:47.729> and

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
is 16 inches with the stand and

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.200 
is 16 inches with the stand and
everything<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:49.320> depth<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.490> monitor

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
everything and the depth of the monitor

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.560 
everything and the depth of the monitor
is<00:01:51.590> 2.4<00:01:52.590> inches<00:01:53.040> which<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.490> believe<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.390> quite

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
is 2.4 inches which I believe is quite

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.310 
is 2.4 inches which I believe is quite
thin<00:01:55.049> actually<00:01:56.180> and<00:01:57.180> one<00:01:57.869> more<00:01:58.020> thing<00:01:58.229> about

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
thin actually and one more thing about

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.389 
thin actually and one more thing about
the

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
the

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.969 
the
the<00:01:59.880> overall<00:02:00.479> physique<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.530> mana<00:02:01.740> table

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
the overall physique of the mana table

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.870 
the overall physique of the mana table
as<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.149> do<00:02:03.329> notice<00:02:03.689> in<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.020> pictures<00:02:04.579> at<00:02:05.579> the

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
as you do notice in the pictures at the

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.359
