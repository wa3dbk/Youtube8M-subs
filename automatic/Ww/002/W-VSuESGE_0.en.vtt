00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.990
 look like there are many choices 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.990
 different 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.030
 build the tractor well with animals 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:18.960
 we do not build with coins 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.960
 different 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:39.239
 it's a cat if we put the cabin on 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.239
 add the wheels here 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.320
 still 2 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.770
 so 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.270
 he 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.270
 and there 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.059
 good 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:27.229
 and again the doors are blue on 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:27.229
 it already does not work 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:39.530
 m 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:42.860
 maybe like that not still not 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:48.990
 first you have to put a chimney 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:51.770
 exhaust well and now we can 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.770
 put the wings 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.570
 1 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.390
 the grille 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.060
 the brice share 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.549
 the front lights 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.549
 and the tractor can ride 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:28.650
 the new tractor is rolling in the field 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.650
 when he passes the calf cows
