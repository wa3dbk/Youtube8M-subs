zoom custom and bring it down to eight

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.310 
zoom custom and bring it down to eight
hundred<00:00:42.329> percent<00:00:43.760> then<00:00:44.760> after<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:46.170> will

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
hundred percent then after that it will

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.619 
hundred percent then after that it will
show<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:48.320> then<00:00:49.320> each<00:00:50.160> one<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.239> one

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
show you and then each one is one

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.160 
show you and then each one is one
separate<00:00:51.930> pixel<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:53.329> you<00:00:54.329> could<00:00:54.539> make<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.960> any

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
separate pixel and you could make it any

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.209 
separate pixel and you could make it any
way<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.710> want<00:00:55.860> any<00:00:56.370> fan<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:56.879> circle<00:00:58.010> just<00:00:59.010> make

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
way you want any fan of circle just make

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.150 
way you want any fan of circle just make
it<00:00:59.370> very<00:00:59.430> easy<00:00:59.850> like<00:01:00.149> that

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
it very easy like that

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.530 
it very easy like that
now<00:01:02.160> let's<00:01:02.340> circle<00:01:02.850> right<00:01:03.000> here<00:01:03.270> very<00:01:03.989> good

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
now let's circle right here very good

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:18.170 
now let's circle right here very good
just<00:01:06.540> go<00:01:06.720> file<00:01:07.020> save<00:01:07.409> as<00:01:14.689> okay<00:01:16.790> don't<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:18.060> know

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
just go file save as okay don't you know

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.840 
just go file save as okay don't you know
you<00:01:18.270> can<00:01:18.509> go<00:01:18.799> have<00:01:19.799> minecraft<00:01:20.100> up<00:01:20.460> at<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.670> same

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
you can go have minecraft up at the same

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.350 
you can go have minecraft up at the same
time<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.740> then<00:01:22.740> what<00:01:23.640> you're<00:01:23.759> gonna<00:01:23.850> do<00:01:24.150> to

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
time and then what you're gonna do to

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.179 
time and then what you're gonna do to
measure<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.869> out<00:01:25.049> cuz<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.619> doesn't<00:01:25.950> show<00:01:26.159> a

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
measure it out cuz it doesn't show a

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.789 
measure it out cuz it doesn't show a
little<00:01:26.369> lines<00:01:26.670> in<00:01:26.850> between<00:01:27.290> this<00:01:28.290> little<00:01:28.650> life

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
little lines in between this little life

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.280 
little lines in between this little life
thing<00:01:29.040> right<00:01:29.159> here<00:01:29.340> just<00:01:29.820> want<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.290> click

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
thing right here just want to click

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.039 
thing right here just want to click
right<00:01:31.409> there<00:01:31.530> 1<00:01:31.890> 2<00:01:31.920> 3<00:01:32.520> 4<00:01:32.970> 5<00:01:33.299> 6<00:01:34.110> 7<00:01:34.680> 8<00:01:35.369> 9<00:01:35.939> 10<00:01:36.360> 11<00:01:36.659> 12

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
right there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.390 
right there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
and<00:01:37.710> oh<00:01:38.490> yes<00:01:39.380> make<00:01:40.380> sure<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:40.829> when<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.220> do

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
and oh yes make sure that when you do

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.080 
and oh yes make sure that when you do
the<00:01:41.759> circle<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:43.020> these<00:01:43.259> lines<00:01:43.680> are<00:01:44.090> uneven

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
the circle that these lines are uneven

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.389 
the circle that these lines are uneven
so<00:01:45.420> how<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.750> was<00:01:45.840> twelve<00:01:46.170> right<00:01:46.290> now<00:01:46.439> try<00:01:47.369> to

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
so how it was twelve right now try to

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.600 
so how it was twelve right now try to
make<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.030> can<00:01:48.180> get<00:01:48.329> even<00:01:48.570> 13<00:01:49.229> or<00:01:49.560> 11<00:01:49.890> or

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
make it so you can get even 13 or 11 or

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.880 
make it so you can get even 13 or 11 or
an<00:01:50.729> odd<00:01:50.909> number<00:01:51.890> 1<00:01:52.890> 2<00:01:53.189> 3<00:01:53.700> 4<00:01:54.240> 5<00:01:54.750> 6<00:01:55.320> 7<00:01:56.130> 8<00:01:56.340> 9<00:01:56.670> 10<00:01:57.509> yeah

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
an odd number 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 yeah

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.530 
an odd number 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 yeah
it's<00:01:58.890> not<00:01:59.100> gonna<00:01:59.280> come<00:01:59.549> out<00:01:59.670> very<00:01:59.850> even<00:02:00.299> in<00:02:00.420> the

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
it's not gonna come out very even in the

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.910 
it's not gonna come out very even in the
circle<00:02:00.960> for<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.350> center<00:02:01.680> point<00:02:03.799> that's<00:02:04.799> how

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
circle for the center point that's how

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.950 
circle for the center point that's how
you<00:02:05.009> know<00:02:05.159> it's<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.399> straight<00:02:05.640> line<00:02:05.850> also<00:02:06.060> you'd

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
you know it's a straight line also you'd

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:16.310 
you know it's a straight line also you'd
also<00:02:07.259> use<00:02:07.439> this<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.829> make<00:02:07.950> domes

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.250 

right<00:02:17.320> there<00:02:17.560> but<00:02:17.860> domes<00:02:18.600> Springs<00:02:19.600> like<00:02:19.840> this

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.990 

and<00:02:23.260> then<00:02:23.530> you<00:02:23.950> just<00:02:23.980> use<00:02:24.370> that<00:02:24.580> part<00:02:24.880> right

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
and then you just use that part right

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.300 
and then you just use that part right
there<00:02:25.410> so<00:02:26.410> I'd<00:02:26.500> be<00:02:26.710> one<00:02:26.980> so<00:02:27.490> that<00:02:27.670> would<00:02:27.880> be<00:02:29.310> one

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
there so I'd be one so that would be one

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:37.440 
there so I'd be one so that would be one
two<00:02:30.970> three<00:02:31.390> four<00:02:31.750> one<00:02:32.680> two<00:02:33.160> three<00:02:35.160> -<00:02:36.270> you<00:02:37.270> know

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
two three four one two three - you know

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.840 
two three four one two three - you know
just<00:02:38.260> make<00:02:38.500> it<00:02:38.680> regular<00:02:39.130> all<00:02:39.490> the<00:02:39.610> way<00:02:39.730> up

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
just make it regular all the way up

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.760 
just make it regular all the way up
there<00:02:40.380> it's<00:02:41.380> only<00:02:41.530> make<00:02:41.740> a<00:02:41.770> good<00:02:42.040> dome<00:02:43.770> you

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
there it's only make a good dome you

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.470 
there it's only make a good dome you
could<00:02:44.980> use<00:02:45.190> either<00:02:45.580> of<00:02:45.790> these<00:02:45.880> for<00:02:46.360> either
