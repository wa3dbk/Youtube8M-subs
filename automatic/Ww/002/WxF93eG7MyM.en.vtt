00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 hello with you sergey ivanov with 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.560
 new video lessons in this video tutorial I 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.080
 show you how to create a soft effect 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.960
 focus on adobe photoshop 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.680
 The principle lesson is very simple this effect 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.320
 created very quickly think possible 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.949
 many of you already know but newbies 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.050
 it will be interesting now I will show that we 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.820
 we will do a look now I will disconnect 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:33.030
 visibility from this layer and now turn on 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.390
 Such effect of soft focus turns out 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.210
 that is, we kind of attract attention 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.329
 person to the part we need on 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.280
 image and now i will show you how 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.590
 how can this be done quickly in the program 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.010
 adobe photoshop models here this layer and 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.469
 night work 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.460
 open the image file open here 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:59.489
 I do not open it in my file 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.940
 the picture the picture opens and now 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.670
 here is the simplest thing we need to do 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.590
 it take here a selection tool any 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.270
 I'll take a lasso tool and 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.240
 just a photo will highlight that area 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.520
 which I need to draw attention to 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.580
 For example, I press the left mouse button and 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.350
 I went to draw like that 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.100
 I will highlight the bride I will highlight 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:30.240
 groom and so will highlight and take here 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:36.110
 a bouquet that is here so smoothly I 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:39.240
 singled out so further what I need to do 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:43.380
 then I switch to quick mask mode 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.250
 you are here editing mode 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.520
 quick masks 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.680
 at the bottom of the tool palettes here 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.040
 look at all that current moment 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.140
 highlighted accordingly she stayed 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.509
 and all that is not highlighted repainted 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.880
 blue if you have a red color is not 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.340
 scare here if you click on 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.460
 mask you can choose the color twice 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.429
 which will show the world red 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.939
 so back go to the mask 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:15.450
 now when we work with a mask 

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:17.549
 now here's a quick mask mode in those 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.670
 our actions will occur over 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:24.329
 selection ie we will work no 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.879
 above the picture and above the mask 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:30.450
 propose to do i will propose 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:33.900
 make a blur of our selection then 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.269
 there is a filter and choose Gaussian Blur 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.590
 you can basically choose any 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.590
 another here is a radial blur 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:45.599
 I will use gauss blur 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:50.370
 chose a blur of gauss and right here 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:52.680
 choosing me need a radius than 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.079
 accordingly will be more beget those 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.370
 according to the limits of your selection 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:01.730
 all will be blurred click ok 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:05.430
 look, you see everything perfectly 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:09.870
 when we applied this blur effect 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:12.419
 I leave the quick mask here 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.639
 definitely create a new layer missing 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:16.430
 rather copy this layer grab it 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:20.220
 left click and carry 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.919
 Here on this icon everything was created 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.069
 copy layer if you have a palette of layers 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:29.220
 no or there is a palette story you always 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:31.560
 you can open the layers window menu either 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.199
 story briefly explain the action you 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.239
 work with layers in the program and here 

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:41.009
 You can undo all actions that 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:43.370
 you usually did the last 20 

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:43.370
 I singled out 

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:49.979
 this gave a copy of the layer and now and now 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.790
 I will apply look not in mode 

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:54.479
 quick masks 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:58.139
 filter blur according to gauss again need 

00:03:54.479 --> 00:04:00.360
 apply then it will apply to me 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:03.480
 here is the highlighted area 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:06.960
 I also need to avoid the effect 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:10.250
 such that the background is blurred 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:13.350
 for this, I invert my selection 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.010
 selection inversion look now 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.590
 highlighted 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:21.350
 all but the area that we have 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:23.640
 filter was selected select blur and 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:30.560
 chooses that example 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:36.080
 gauss here choose the desired parameter 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:39.690
 For example, let it be 49 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:42.050
 all click ok see what we have 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:47.270
 This is the effect 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:49.440
 here we can change the opacity 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:53.580
 that is, that's how we change 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:57.720
 opacity right now can take off 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:59.190
 selection i press kontrol b he 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.820
 look what we got here 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:05.040
 now here's the soft effect 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:11.880
 focus on the image that is with us 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:14.580
 now here left sharply highlighted groom 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.740
 bride bouquet and everything around 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.650
 we have a little blurry that is if you 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.120
 want you can check yourself 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:24.290
 opacity of this layer either change 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:29.000
 blending mode example on the screen 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:29.000
 also such an interesting effect is obtained 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:35.640
 try in general 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:38.340
 in this video tutorial I showed you how 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.710
 can create soft focus on 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:44.190
 image and thereby attract 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:46.979
 human attention to the desired part 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:49.140
 in your photo with you was Sergey 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:51.500
 ivanov and see you next
