 been dominated by multinationals from 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.600
 big industrial companies that produced mass 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.490

 most of the children went to 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.680
 search outside of Italy to be able to

 police process 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.220
 everything comes from a vision that becomes 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.399
 research that takes shape in our own 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.399

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.600
 for my beers and choose to get 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.870
 an original flavor to enhance the 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.870
 aromas 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.370
 the master brewers make ours 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.230
 community a better place because many 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.910
 tourists come here to taste the 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.590
 our beers but also because we are 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.480
 naturally linked to our territory 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.140
 and our beers are proof of this 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.780

 quality to reduce costs 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:09.710
 we are not brewers we are brewers 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.710

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.280
