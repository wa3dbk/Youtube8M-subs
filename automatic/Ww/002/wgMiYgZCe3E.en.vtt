00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello, welcome to my book 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.450
 I am an olive tree genius and 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.189
 video of today I will talk about pitch or 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.830
 What's it called in some places? 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.420
 talk about resin the pitch or resin 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.400
 that we use to pass a bow of 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.859
 violin is extracted from 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.350
 pine tree and passed by 17 until 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.150
 in this form here is this little pebble that is the 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.279
 that we use to go through the mane of 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.960
 bow of the violin but for what it serves 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.630
 Why do you have to put it in the mane? 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.849
 She can not take the mane without opening it. 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.500
 sound of the violin the pitch that serves to 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.140
 make the child in the room have 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.630
 more string friction and thus generate 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.180
 sound there as I must pass it abreu until 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.719
 How much do I have to spend in Brazil? 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.730
 pitch dark 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.129
 You 'll get your bow that's going to be there. 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.110
 Loosened up is probably going to squeeze him 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.180
 Take care not to squeeze too much here. 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.100
 wore unlike the scale of the 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.930
 bow is always down here in that 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.300
 point but it is always there ever 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.579
 plan harder you will only tighten 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.620
 a little bit not too well the great 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.329
 hold the bow in the right hand there goes 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.829
 hold your bow in your right hand pick up 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.530
 Your good or more or less today, will you? 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.750
 leave the violin from 58 on the pitch and 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.700
 You will not pass the pitch on your bow. 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.070
 Last March the pitch and remember that only 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.140
 will pass the mane donate covered the part 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.270
 of the corner that will touch the ropes 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.850
 You will pass until the crisis is over. 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.939
 completely the same color will usually go 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.740
 I'm kind of white, I 've come to some forums. 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.479
 I always look on the internet to see what 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.820
 made the staff talk and listen to a 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.820
 place where they speak other than being two 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.490
 times and it feels good and you will not 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.380
 up to here it does not look the same color as the whole 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.210
 Once you get the violin, you 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.950
 will pass opened again will pass 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.000
 passing by passing passing 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.909
 can pass the entire length of the air as 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.590
 spend a lot and if you go and get it 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.299
 going to touch what will happen is going 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.310
 be very poor will do to see if 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.740
 It's bad for you not to go wrong with 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.710
 powder that will do just catch will rock the 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.719
 air a little to get the excess of 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.060
 and then you will touch it reminds you that 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.460
 turn 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.649
 You 're going to play the violin, will you? 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.140
 I will not necessarily stay again 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.180
 violin thing like I said but it's good 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.039
 because it makes it easy for you to pass too 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.360
 put some pressure on you 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.459
 I can take mine too when you 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.190
 buy the pitch it comes with a film 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.870
 transparent over the top just passing here 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.670
 It's kind of difficult in Brazil, this movie. 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.330
 What you can do is get a little list. 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.950
 until it becomes a bright color and then 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.330
 take the air pass the audience will stay 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.340
 much easier the whites more 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.319
 professionals they are very easy to 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.569
 take only you pass from passing in the air that 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.959
 It goes well for anyone who is curious, I use 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:37.060
 the larsen pitch is one of the best 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.470
 market players if not the best and is the 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.150
 which I like the most forward, come on. 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.549
 make a video about the types of bell 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.739
 that broke I bought that cuts exists 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.420
 a curse about Brazil that is the 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.730
 I even asked for a brazil that is not 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.410
 mine is not what i use the internet like 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.799
 is called a serious salutation that you 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:57.940
 You can never get the pitch pointing to the 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:03:00.430
 light and tell our looks soap if you 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.430
 do it one hour your price will fall 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.810
 amil within a month can write 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.810
 talking to all the people who did 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.100
 that his goals had tragic ends if 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.590
 Did you like the video? Do not forget to 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.540
 stay down and enjoyed and share with 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.640
 your friends who are learning what is 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.709
 learn violin if it's new here 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.019
 subscribe to the channel watch others 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.970
 videos, you just have to access the point with 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.160
 base in the textbook leave new videos 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.299
 From Monday to Friday at 8 PM I expect 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.620
