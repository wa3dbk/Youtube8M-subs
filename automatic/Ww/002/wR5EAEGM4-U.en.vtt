00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:09.219 
the enhanced vision system and what it

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:11.999 
the enhanced vision system and what it
allows<00:00:09.339> us<00:00:09.759> to<00:00:09.999> do<00:00:10.299> is<00:00:10.570> augment<00:00:11.080> reality<00:00:11.230> what

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:12.009 
allows us to do is augment reality what

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:14.069 
allows us to do is augment reality what
I<00:00:12.039> mean<00:00:12.280> by<00:00:12.429> that<00:00:12.459> is<00:00:12.849> that<00:00:13.179> it<00:00:13.480> allows<00:00:13.780> us

00:00:14.069 --> 00:00:14.079 
I mean by that is that it allows us

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:16.140 
I mean by that is that it allows us
using<00:00:14.619> transparent<00:00:15.249> display<00:00:15.579> technology

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
you're a pilot the infrared sensor can

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.940 
you're a pilot the infrared sensor can
show<00:02:07.450> the<00:02:08.080> temperature<00:02:08.530> difference<00:02:08.860> between

be displayed
on<00:02:13.379> a<00:02:13.439> HUD<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:13.859> you<00:02:13.950> could<00:02:14.129> land<00:02:14.489> your<00:02:14.790> plane

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049
