felt like you know I think a lot of
feedback<00:01:34.170> we've<00:01:34.440> gotten<00:01:34.470> from<00:01:34.680> players<00:01:34.980> is

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
that we felt like they would the pension

that we felt like they would the pension
swung<00:01:36.600> too<00:01:36.780> far<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:37.740> we've<00:01:38.190> found<00:01:38.550> this

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:38.730 
swung too far and so we've found this

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.070 
swung too far and so we've found this
middle<00:01:39.060> ground<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:41.630> think<00:01:42.630> we<00:01:42.690> found<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.960> sweet
