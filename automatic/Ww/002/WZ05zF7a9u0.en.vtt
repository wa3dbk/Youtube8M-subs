00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.190 
showing a different way to do it from
the<00:01:37.920> left<00:01:38.130> up<00:01:38.460> there<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.509> got<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.780> kill<00:01:39.960> them

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
the left up there you got to kill them

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.860 
the left up there you got to kill them
then

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
then

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.600 
then
maybe<00:01:41.140> four<00:01:41.380> guys<00:01:41.500> that<00:01:41.530> spawns<00:01:41.950> behind<00:01:42.460> you

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
maybe four guys that spawns behind you

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.060 
maybe four guys that spawns behind you
and<00:01:42.700> you<00:01:42.790> killed<00:01:43.030> those<00:01:43.210> guys<00:01:43.590> but<00:01:44.590> this<00:01:44.860> by

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
and you killed those guys but this by

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.920 
and you killed those guys but this by
far<00:01:45.310> is<00:01:45.370> way<00:01:45.850> better<00:01:46.060> you<00:01:46.420> get<00:01:46.540> so<00:01:46.660> many<00:01:46.750> more

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
far is way better you get so many more

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.280 
far is way better you get so many more
ingredients<00:01:47.380> by<00:01:47.470> doing<00:01:47.710> it<00:01:47.860> this<00:01:48.040> way<00:01:49.290> the

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
ingredients by doing it this way the

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.050 
ingredients by doing it this way the
problem<00:01:50.620> is<00:01:50.710> that<00:01:50.740> guys<00:01:51.190> up<00:01:51.460> there<00:01:51.640> right<00:01:51.850> now

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
problem is that guys up there right now

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.900 
problem is that guys up there right now
he's<00:01:52.330> now<00:01:52.900> missing<00:01:53.170> to<00:01:53.440> spawn<00:01:53.710> but<00:01:54.580> if<00:01:54.730> you

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 
he's now missing to spawn but if you

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.600 
he's now missing to spawn but if you
guys<00:01:55.030> can<00:01:55.240> tell<00:01:55.420> there's<00:01:55.660> one<00:01:55.870> two<00:01:56.140> three<00:01:56.680> if

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
guys can tell there's one two three if

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.670 
guys can tell there's one two three if
there's<00:01:57.850> another<00:01:58.120> one<00:01:58.360> up<00:01:58.540> there<00:01:58.930> I<00:01:59.290> believe

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
there's another one up there I believe

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.520 
there's another one up there I believe
and<00:02:00.460> then<00:02:00.640> there's<00:02:00.880> one<00:02:01.210> right<00:02:01.330> behind<00:02:01.530> so

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
and then there's one right behind so

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.350 
and then there's one right behind so
there's<00:02:02.950> already<00:02:03.070> four<00:02:03.400> engrams<00:02:03.880> just

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
there's already four engrams just

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.420 
there's already four engrams just
showing<00:02:04.900> I'll<00:02:05.740> probably<00:02:05.950> been<00:02:06.190> doing<00:02:06.370> this

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
showing I'll probably been doing this

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.160 
showing I'll probably been doing this
may<00:02:06.610> be<00:02:06.670> left<00:02:06.880> by<00:02:07.030> that<00:02:07.300> it's<00:02:07.510> before<00:02:08.110> I
