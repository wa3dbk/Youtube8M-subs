a<00:01:21.130> quarter<00:01:21.430> inch<00:01:21.579> strip<00:01:21.909> was<00:01:22.119> cut<00:01:22.390> from<00:01:22.630> two

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
a quarter inch strip was cut from two

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:26.310 
a quarter inch strip was cut from two
fabrics<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.909> extra<00:01:25.270> quarter<00:01:25.570> inch<00:01:25.780> was<00:01:26.140> to

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
fabrics the extra quarter inch was to

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.990 
fabrics the extra quarter inch was to
allow<00:01:26.560> for<00:01:26.859> the<00:01:26.950> seam<00:01:27.219> allowance<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:30.000> now

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
allow for the seam allowance and now

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.170 
allow for the seam allowance and now
this<00:01:31.299> fabric<00:01:31.780> will<00:01:32.049> be<00:01:32.079> marked<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:33.880> is<00:01:34.149> a

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
this fabric will be marked this is a

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:55.040 
this fabric will be marked this is a
four<00:01:34.630> inch<00:01:34.659> wide<00:01:34.869> ruler

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.980 

so<00:01:56.050> four<00:01:56.410> inch<00:01:57.360> blocks<00:01:58.360> are<00:01:58.660> going<00:01:58.840> to<00:01:58.900> be

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
so four inch blocks are going to be

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:05.430 
so four inch blocks are going to be
marked<00:01:59.440> to<00:02:00.150> be<00:02:01.150> cut<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:04.630> pretending<00:02:05.410> that

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
marked to be cut and pretending that

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:26.559 
marked to be cut and pretending that
this<00:02:05.740> is<00:02:13.620> one<00:02:14.620> fabric

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.789 

so<00:02:27.140> each<00:02:27.469> line<00:02:28.360> gets<00:02:29.360> cut<00:02:29.750> that<00:02:30.379> was<00:02:30.560> just

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799 
so each line gets cut that was just

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:37.539 
so each line gets cut that was just
marked<00:02:31.040> it<00:02:32.980> is<00:02:33.980> cut<00:02:34.340> to<00:02:35.409> the<00:02:36.409> same<00:02:36.680> line<00:02:36.950> be

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
marked it is cut to the same line be

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.449 
marked it is cut to the same line be
careful<00:02:38.000> not<00:02:38.269> to<00:02:38.510> cut<00:02:38.689> into<00:02:38.840> your<00:02:39.019> stitches<00:02:39.459> it

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
careful not to cut into your stitches it

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.360 
careful not to cut into your stitches it
was<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:40.790> same<00:02:41.060> on<00:02:41.329> the<00:02:42.140> other<00:02:42.170> side<00:02:42.379> it<00:02:43.189> was

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
was the same on the other side it was

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:58.209 
was the same on the other side it was
cut<00:02:43.670> to<00:02:44.569> the<00:02:45.230> same<00:02:45.500> line<00:02:55.030> just<00:02:56.030> like<00:02:57.189> when<00:02:58.189> we

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:58.219 
cut to the same line just like when we

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:01.270 
cut to the same line just like when we
were<00:02:58.400> doing<00:02:58.879> the<00:02:59.139> one<00:03:00.139> fabric<00:03:00.470> prairie<00:03:00.950> point

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
were doing the one fabric prairie point

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:10.760 
were doing the one fabric prairie point
you<00:03:01.639> cut<00:03:02.120> to<00:03:02.689> the<00:03:03.400> center<00:03:04.400> line

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.970 

these<00:03:11.580> are<00:03:11.940> folded<00:03:12.450> just<00:03:12.870> as<00:03:13.020> though<00:03:13.230> we<00:03:13.830> were

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
these are folded just as though we were

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.190 
these are folded just as though we were
using<00:03:14.220> one<00:03:14.730> fabric<00:03:17.420> fold<00:03:18.420> it<00:03:18.570> on<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:18.750> diagonal

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
using one fabric fold it on the diagonal

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:27.260 
using one fabric fold it on the diagonal
once<00:03:21.620> and<00:03:23.270> twice<00:03:24.830> this<00:03:25.830> is<00:03:26.040> block<00:03:26.730> number<00:03:26.760> one

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
once and twice this is block number one

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:35.000 
once and twice this is block number one
and<00:03:28.040> then<00:03:29.510> go<00:03:30.510> up<00:03:30.720> to<00:03:31.280> number<00:03:32.280> two<00:03:33.770> this<00:03:34.770> is

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
and then go up to number two this is

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.310 
and then go up to number two this is
going<00:03:35.220> to<00:03:35.280> be<00:03:35.370> accessing<00:03:35.850> XS<00:03:36.660> it<00:03:36.840> will<00:03:36.990> be<00:03:37.080> cut

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
going to be accessing XS it will be cut

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.210 
going to be accessing XS it will be cut
off

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.230 

fold<00:03:41.220> up<00:03:41.490> number<00:03:41.820> one<00:03:42.110> and<00:03:43.670> fold<00:03:44.670> number<00:03:44.910> two

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
fold up number one and fold number two

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:55.630 
fold up number one and fold number two
down<00:03:45.480> over<00:03:45.960> it<00:03:48.590> give<00:03:49.590> it<00:03:49.620> a<00:03:49.800> good<00:03:49.980> steam<00:03:54.530> and

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
down over it give it a good steam and

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:09.300 
down over it give it a good steam and
this<00:03:56.640> continues<00:03:57.270> on<00:03:57.480> down<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:57.990> row

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.910 

fold<00:04:09.880> up<00:04:10.090> number<00:04:10.450> three<00:04:12.780> and<00:04:13.780> bring<00:04:14.710> number

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
fold up number three and bring number

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:24.400 
fold up number three and bring number
four<00:04:15.220> down

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:31.940 

I'm<00:04:25.410> also<00:04:25.590> going<00:04:26.009> to<00:04:26.100> pin<00:04:26.400> them

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.500 

so<00:04:32.700> because<00:04:33.120> they<00:04:33.270> have<00:04:33.300> a<00:04:33.420> tendency

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
so because they have a tendency

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:40.760 
so because they have a tendency
sometimes<00:04:33.960> to<00:04:34.500> come<00:04:34.770> and<00:04:34.920> fold<00:04:35.130> it<00:04:35.310> on<00:04:35.430> you

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.580 

as<00:04:40.949> I<00:04:41.580> demonstrated<00:04:42.300> in<00:04:42.900> the<00:04:44.210> one<00:04:45.210> fabric

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
as I demonstrated in the one fabric

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:52.159 
as I demonstrated in the one fabric
prairie<00:04:46.590> points<00:04:48.740> you<00:04:49.740> will<00:04:49.919> measure<00:04:50.930> the<00:04:51.930> side

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
prairie points you will measure the side
