00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.330
 why his career 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.700
 in three weeks after I leave the college pastor at 196 6 km 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:13.079
 despite this let him know and 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:16.480
 fourth sears with a daily pellet 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.480
 that's why the dax in Frankfurt 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:26.619
 because the most 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.329
 professors 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:30.140
 if the psg 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.420
 man of culture 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.420
 we cross colorama bicycle club german 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.290
 taken globally 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.290
 we do not care 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.810
 at 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.010
 French defense then it would be necessary to say because I do not believe it to be 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.010
 aware 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.780
 we are still if gravity 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.049
 at only 20 years old 

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:03.630
 a third term for Christmas 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.630
 they tell me in 80 games and I lived dreaming 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.610
 he has his habits 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.610
 obama did not behave thanks 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.370
 and that tasty phrase is 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.960
 July further they also have rights 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.660
 we take too much the corons 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.020
 it says 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.560
 he will understand 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.000
 more than his opponent 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.180
 - it's not a cinema job 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.180
 large schools 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.780
 2:20 p.m. 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.780
 we respect the foot explained he is waiting for me 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.830
 good still a classic horror movie because they train to ps3 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.620
 it's still a sweet revenge 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.130
 kiwi division 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.030
 isolated by the tide 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.070
 Meanwhile 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.920
 however as not say 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.380
 good he has the taste 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.840
 she has only registered so far a small castle of 35 pieces 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.639
 38 years old on weekends 

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:16.129
 excuse me this spell a little bit my mother my grandmother 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.739
 thanks to this device including the tricolor 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.739
 so we go there 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:26.609
 it is also what makes tell if sega kardashian this season kaka 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.519
 for the rest sharp rise in its cost 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:31.989
 however nothing to do 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.989
 we are not tender so tackle it he had 

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:43.259
 but happy 

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:45.729
 however this is not the beginning of the film 

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:48.219
 hen 4 the face 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:49.799
 in short 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.799
 here the psg was taking place 

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:55.149
 late 

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:57.429
 when night falls 

00:02:57.429 --> 00:03:00.429
 yes totally 

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:03.289
 at 2.30 pm 

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:06.749
 that's because in history it will be the case with that they fell 

00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:08.129
 in the fight against tobacco 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:09.989
 especially defeat al-Qaeda 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.379
 he could have spent that 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:14.099
 anyway the little player per player 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.269
 abhisit and his guards 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:18.369
 why she 

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:20.879
 Cancellara 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:23.879
 and therefore a quarter of an hour after the beginning of the film 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:26.279
 keith richards 

00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:29.279
 eight months 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:33.269
 I am not ashamed of gold 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.869
 the institution emphasized 

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:38.139
 he tells himself that this story is 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:40.299
 250 fighter pilots 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.299
 to say that we are in the balance sheet 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:48.919
 we are still facing the espanyol defender proves that he did when 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:51.769
 even 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.760
 here are three points and 6 passes 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.279
 pleyel ap 

00:03:56.279 --> 00:03:58.729
 there the stronger than beat them 

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:00.079
 I suppose 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:02.729
 I heard a noise in the terrace 

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:05.729
 gharbi in the attic 

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:11.319
 no I am sorry 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.659
 you do not know you give me at that point david fortin I think that 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:16.939
 what do you think 

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:20.979
 me what I do thoroughly there his crazy hair on the living room table 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:23.050
 with every other rich country 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.309
 around me 

00:04:26.309 --> 00:04:30.249
 they really should not be the glory of the caravan to lob 

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:31.479
 assassin 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:33.340
 it is not in rest 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.229
 leucate always 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:36.919
 this time the cameraman 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:39.740
 with him we are always qualified 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.889
 is not the world at all 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:45.620
 I'm waiting like that in a style to say it clears 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:48.449
 I do not see why this 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:51.409
 and for the moment to draw one time 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:54.409
 because we know very well that this output fits on 10 

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:59.189
 the 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:02.409
 I am standing upright 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:03.889
 there it's done 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:05.870
 I do not want 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.789
 I talked more about everyone gets up 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:11.120
 and then everyone is fighting at 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.900
 panels 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.900
 m 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.610
 his clients thing happened between I say I'm the same 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:26.710
 I do not wish to see his cv jesus to balance the report with 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.930
 late schedule 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.110
 nothing will be marked 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.979
 I can not 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:37.210
 they are worn that's what you want me to tell you 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.529
 it will be necessary to wait forty years on November 6 

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:42.719
 carlos tavares 

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:44.969
 and that would be good 

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:47.860
 so sony lost their hosts 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.620
 so that's it 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:50.670
 I say 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.670
 I no longer have marleix physically cinema 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.210
 we take too much country 

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:03.499
 45
