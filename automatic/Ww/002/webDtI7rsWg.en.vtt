00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
this because it just adds so that

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.840 
this because it just adds so that
texture<00:01:54.840> makes<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.560> soft<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.130> fluffy<00:01:56.400> and

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
texture makes it soft and fluffy and

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.360 
texture makes it soft and fluffy and
lovely<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.540> silky<00:01:57.990> in<00:01:58.080> your<00:01:58.230> mouth<00:01:58.410> so<00:01:58.980> just<00:01:59.250> a

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
lovely and silky in your mouth so just a

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.910

little<00:01:59.490> dash<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.270> not<00:02:00.900> a<00:02:00.930> whole<00:02:01.230> egg<00:02:01.530> white<00:02:01.740> by

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
little dash and not a whole egg white by

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.590 
little dash and not a whole egg white by
any<00:02:02.100> means<00:02:02.370> probably<00:02:02.730> more<00:02:02.940> like<00:02:03.150> a<00:02:03.180> quarter

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600
