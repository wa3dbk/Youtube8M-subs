getting a little bit more of an
understanding<00:01:21.319> of<00:01:21.380> this<00:01:21.609> VFR<00:01:22.609> V

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
understanding of this VFR V

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.289 
understanding of this VFR V
four-cylinder<00:01:24.770> concept<00:01:25.219> that<00:01:25.399> Honda<00:01:25.880> has<00:01:26.119> had

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
four-cylinder concept that Honda has had

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.929 
four-cylinder concept that Honda has had
for<00:01:26.509> so<00:01:26.689> long<00:01:26.899> and<00:01:27.079> has<00:01:27.770> really<00:01:28.130> increased<00:01:28.459> in

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
for so long and has really increased in

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.270 
for so long and has really increased in
the<00:01:29.060> depth<00:01:29.270> of<00:01:29.420> range<00:01:29.719> with<00:01:29.990> this<00:01:30.170> this<00:01:30.500> v4

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
the depth of range with this this v4

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.029 
the depth of range with this this v4
layout<00:01:34.569> well<00:01:35.569> it's<00:01:35.719> an<00:01:35.810> 800<00:01:36.200> cc<00:01:36.590> at<00:01:36.709> the<00:01:36.829> heart

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
layout well it's an 800 cc at the heart

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:40.389 
layout well it's an 800 cc at the heart
of<00:01:37.189> it<00:01:37.310> is<00:01:37.399> the<00:01:37.520> old<00:01:37.670> VFR<00:01:38.209> 800<00:01:39.110> with<00:01:39.619> the<00:01:39.799> VTEC

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
of it is the old VFR 800 with the VTEC

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.130 
of it is the old VFR 800 with the VTEC
type<00:01:40.789> of<00:01:41.030> motor<00:01:41.239> so<00:01:41.509> when<00:01:41.629> you<00:01:41.719> get<00:01:41.899> on<00:01:42.020> the

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
type of motor so when you get on the

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.410 
type of motor so when you get on the
pipe<00:01:42.349> it<00:01:42.590> sounds<00:01:43.099> glorious<00:01:43.520> it's<00:01:44.090> not<00:01:44.239> this

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
pipe it sounds glorious it's not this

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.240 
pipe it sounds glorious it's not this
war<00:01:45.140> app<00:01:45.349> that<00:01:45.679> comes<00:01:45.860> out<00:01:46.069> of<00:01:46.099> the

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
war app that comes out of the

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.919 
war app that comes out of the
carburetors<00:01:46.789> when<00:01:47.179> I<00:01:47.239> say<00:01:47.390> carburetors<00:01:47.810> of

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929 
carburetors when I say carburetors of

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:49.809 
carburetors when I say carburetors of
course<00:01:48.110> I<00:01:48.200> mean<00:01:48.349> fuel<00:01:48.560> injection<00:01:49.069> it's<00:01:49.700> about

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:49.819 
course I mean fuel injection it's about

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:51.999 
course I mean fuel injection it's about
turning<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:50.270> 30<00:01:50.420> kilograms<00:01:50.659> 800<00:01:51.439> CC<00:01:51.770> so<00:01:51.920> it's

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
turning the 30 kilograms 800 CC so it's

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.339 
turning the 30 kilograms 800 CC so it's
not<00:01:52.159> the<00:01:52.340> fastest<00:01:52.909> thing<00:01:52.939> around<00:01:53.299> but<00:01:54.140> hey<00:01:54.289> you

00:01:54.339 --> 00:01:54.349 
not the fastest thing around but hey you

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:56.050 
not the fastest thing around but hey you
know<00:01:54.560> what<00:01:54.739> it's<00:01:55.009> quite<00:01:55.159> surprising<00:01:55.729> how<00:01:55.759> fast

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
know what it's quite surprising how fast

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.119 
know what it's quite surprising how fast
this<00:01:56.239> little<00:01:56.539> bike<00:01:56.719> actually<00:01:56.989> is<00:01:57.349> I<00:01:57.590> think

00:01:58.119 --> 00:01:58.129
