build your path you'll want to scope out
where<00:00:47.480> you<00:00:47.600> want<00:00:47.780> you<00:00:47.930> to<00:00:48.080> go<00:00:48.230> as<00:00:48.530> well<00:00:48.890> as<00:00:48.980> the

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
where you want you to go as well as the

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
path you wanted to take one thing to

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.319 
path you wanted to take one thing to
keep<00:00:51.860> in<00:00:52.010> mind<00:00:52.070> is<00:00:52.430> that<00:00:52.460> path<00:00:52.760> points<00:00:53.090> behave

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
keep in mind is that path points behave

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.180 
keep in mind is that path points behave
more<00:00:53.570> like<00:00:53.600> objects<00:00:54.200> and<00:00:54.320> other<00:00:54.440> logic<00:00:54.829> boxes

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
more like objects and other logic boxes

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.160 
more like objects and other logic boxes
this<00:00:55.730> is<00:00:55.790> because<00:00:56.240> path<00:00:56.480> points<00:00:56.870> are<00:00:57.020> required

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
this is because path points are required

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
this is because path points are required
