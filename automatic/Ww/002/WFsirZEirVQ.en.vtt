00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.310
 marketing we communicate to a 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.440

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.170
 take out this reel shortly then it 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.150
 it took a little longer then that that 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.890
 internet page that gathers a little 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.920
 all innovations within the

 began to rain visits and visits to 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.700
 the web because of course it had a marked 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.290
 character is something new within a 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.720
 world where there are not many new things 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.370
 every year something new draws attention and 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.720
 from here they found out 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.580
 distributors from different countries 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.620

 definitely the sales that went away 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.470
 immediately it was almost I have it I put it 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.120

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.540
 distributor 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.730
 is to be international was born with the idea 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.980

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.510
 we made the market to 99 the market 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.180
 I was out of Spain so I was not 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.750
 it was an option was directly the idea 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.750
 initial 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.430
 We take the initiative to sell a 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.260

 austral in new zealand and this year 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.470
 we entered to distribute already after a 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.450
 lots of conversation negotiations 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.239
 in the USA which is the number one market to 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:49.770
 global level and in the conosur so that 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.770
 let's have seasonal sales 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.380
 the way you can do it 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.480
 internationalize is to say I'm going to 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.010
 internationalize me that is there is no one 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.560
 magic formula you have to learn and there 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.120
 to hit and you have to go back to 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.330
 back and you have to learn from the mistakes 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.790
 and continue and that's the way in which 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.470
 you can internationalize a company 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.020
 new with new ideas for an audience 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.970
 very specialized for that reason for team fish 

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:20.700
 it is very important to have a communication 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.670
 direct with the fishermen for it 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.590
 make use of new technologies in 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.510
 Internet to communicate with our 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.910
 clients to reach them is absolutely 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.890
 fundamental is the shortest route and also 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.260
 the way that is double direction the 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.670
 Client can contact you and you 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.950
 you can find out what the client 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.930
 opinion and what the client needs 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.070
 we work in all areas 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.960

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.540
 we are on twitter on facebook that 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.980
 we are in flickr a very satisfying 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.800
 big was when we started to 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.780
 find us that there was a person of 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.750
 video in new york 'and perth was fishing in 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.910
 the manhattan lakes 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.500
 and we watched our reel every day in 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.170
 a different photo 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.390
 that he left here to be fishing there 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.890
 doing his function with someone who is 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.020
 delighted and that's why photography and 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.260
 what uploads to the internet was a satisfaction 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.260
 big
