00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
I thought the author did that really

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.120 
I thought the author did that really
well<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.970> main<00:01:12.150> character<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.689> Lenny<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.350> the

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
well the main character is Lenny and the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.499 
well the main character is Lenny and the
other<00:01:14.280> main<00:01:14.520> characters<00:01:14.880> in<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.060> book<00:01:15.119> are

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
other main characters in the book are

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.920 
other main characters in the book are
the<00:01:15.810> new<00:01:16.020> boy<00:01:16.170> Joe<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:17.210> Bailey's<00:01:18.210> boyfriend

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
the new boy Joe and Bailey's boyfriend

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.109 
the new boy Joe and Bailey's boyfriend
Toby<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.770> thought<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.610> characters<00:01:20.970> were

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
Toby I thought the characters were

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.649 
Toby I thought the characters were
really<00:01:21.360> believable<00:01:22.080> in<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.409> way<00:01:23.360> what<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.390> liked

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
really believable in a way what I liked

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.370 
really believable in a way what I liked
about<00:01:24.750> Lenny<00:01:25.080> was<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.590> she's<00:01:25.799> very<00:01:26.070> flawed

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
about Lenny was that she's very flawed

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.469 
about Lenny was that she's very flawed
she's<00:01:28.380> not<00:01:28.530> perfect<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.490> hate<00:01:30.000> perfect

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
she's not perfect and I hate perfect

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.149 
she's not perfect and I hate perfect
characters<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:31.079> think<00:01:31.110> they're<00:01:31.680> really<00:01:32.009> hard

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
characters I think they're really hard

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.359 
characters I think they're really hard
to<00:01:32.280> relate<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.930> they're<00:01:33.930> really<00:01:34.229> just<00:01:34.950> not

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
to relate to they're really just not

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.340 
to relate to they're really just not
believable<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.479> just<00:01:36.659> don't<00:01:36.840> like<00:01:36.990> reading

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
believable and I just don't like reading

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.620 
believable and I just don't like reading
perfect<00:01:38.280> characters<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.850> think<00:01:39.090> they<00:01:39.210> have<00:01:39.479> to

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
perfect characters I think they have to

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.020 
perfect characters I think they have to
have<00:01:39.810> some<00:01:40.079> kind<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.380> flaw<00:01:40.619> in<00:01:40.860> them<00:01:41.040> otherwise

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
have some kind of flaw in them otherwise

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.999 
have some kind of flaw in them otherwise
they<00:01:42.090> just<00:01:42.390> don't<00:01:42.570> feel<00:01:42.750> real<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.409> I<00:01:43.799> liked

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
they just don't feel real and I liked

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.399 
they just don't feel real and I liked
about<00:01:44.070> Lenny<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.970> she<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:45.659> incredibly

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
about Lenny is that she is incredibly

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.679 
about Lenny is that she is incredibly
flawed<00:01:46.710> even<00:01:47.670> maybe<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.970> little<00:01:48.210> bit<00:01:48.420> too

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
flawed even maybe a little bit too

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.569 
flawed even maybe a little bit too
flawed<00:01:48.990> what<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.350> did<00:01:49.649> find<00:01:49.920> about<00:01:50.130> Lenny<00:01:50.369> is

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
flawed what I did find about Lenny is

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.090 
flawed what I did find about Lenny is
that<00:01:50.850> she<00:01:51.090> did<00:01:51.329> annoy<00:01:51.630> me<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:52.140> little<00:01:52.829> bit

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
that she did annoy me a little bit

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.429 
that she did annoy me a little bit
throughout<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.610> book<00:01:53.759> some<00:01:54.329> parts<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.750> she

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
throughout the book some parts of she

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.560 
throughout the book some parts of she
just<00:01:55.470> doesn't<00:01:56.460> seem<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.640> be<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.850> very<00:01:57.090> likable

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
just doesn't seem to be a very likable

me and that's just a little pet peeve

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.339

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:44.699 
this book quite a lot which kind of

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:46.280 
this book quite a lot which kind of
annoyed<00:03:44.940> me<00:03:45.209> I<00:03:45.389> feel<00:03:45.599> like<00:03:45.720> I'm<00:03:45.900> being<00:03:46.049> really

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
annoyed me I feel like I'm being really

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.710 
annoyed me I feel like I'm being really
negative<00:03:46.829> about<00:03:46.919> this<00:03:47.190> book<00:03:47.489> I<00:03:47.699> did<00:03:48.419> give<00:03:48.599> it

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
negative about this book I did give it

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.039 
negative about this book I did give it
four<00:03:48.959> stars<00:03:48.989> because<00:03:49.709> I<00:03:49.799> really<00:03:50.190> enjoyed<00:03:50.459> it

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
four stars because I really enjoyed it

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:52.970 
four stars because I really enjoyed it
again<00:03:52.049> like<00:03:52.230> I<00:03:52.349> said<00:03:52.410> I<00:03:52.590> thought<00:03:52.769> it<00:03:52.829> was

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
again like I said I thought it was

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.729 
again like I said I thought it was
beautifully<00:03:53.430> written<00:03:53.480> I<00:03:54.480> loved<00:03:55.290> the

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
beautifully written I loved the

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.619 
beautifully written I loved the
character<00:03:56.069> development<00:03:56.190> was<00:03:56.639> good<00:03:56.940> and<00:03:57.299> I

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 
character development was good and I

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:59.390 
character development was good and I
know<00:03:57.690> I<00:03:57.810> bashed<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.500> characters<00:03:58.919> quite<00:03:59.160> a<00:03:59.190> lot

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
know I bashed the characters quite a lot

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.680 
know I bashed the characters quite a lot
but<00:03:59.579> the<00:03:59.699> development<00:04:00.180> of<00:04:00.239> the<00:04:00.329> characters

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
but the development of the characters

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.479 
but the development of the characters
was<00:04:00.870> good<00:04:01.139> I<00:04:01.349> thought<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:01.919> ending<00:04:02.220> tied

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
was good I thought the ending tied

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.119 
was good I thought the ending tied
everything<00:04:02.760> up<00:04:03.030> really<00:04:03.150> nicely<00:04:03.650> without<00:04:04.650> kind

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:05.129 
everything up really nicely without kind

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:07.640 
everything up really nicely without kind
of<00:04:05.190> being<00:04:05.489> too<00:04:05.669> cheesy<00:04:06.030> and<00:04:06.419> the<00:04:06.959> ending<00:04:07.290> I

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
of being too cheesy and the ending I

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.559 
of being too cheesy and the ending I
threw<00:04:08.190> him<00:04:08.400> if<00:04:08.639> that's<00:04:08.849> the<00:04:08.970> word<00:04:09.150> and<00:04:09.359> it<00:04:09.449> was

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
threw him if that's the word and it was

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.479 
threw him if that's the word and it was
really<00:04:09.720> well<00:04:09.900> written<00:04:10.109> if<00:04:10.709> the<00:04:11.129> author<00:04:11.310> had

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
really well written if the author had

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.729 
really well written if the author had
just<00:04:11.699> focused<00:04:12.060> all<00:04:12.180> in<00:04:12.359> the<00:04:12.419> grief<00:04:12.659> aspect<00:04:13.199> and

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
just focused all in the grief aspect and

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.770 
just focused all in the grief aspect and
the<00:04:13.859> tragedy<00:04:14.430> aspect<00:04:15.090> I<00:04:15.269> think<00:04:15.299> it<00:04:15.599> would<00:04:15.690> have

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
the tragedy aspect I think it would have

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.199 
the tragedy aspect I think it would have
been<00:04:15.900> really<00:04:16.380> SuperDuper<00:04:17.070> good<00:04:17.459> but<00:04:18.030> I<00:04:18.060> think

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
been really SuperDuper good but I think

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.029 
been really SuperDuper good but I think
she<00:04:18.630> just<00:04:18.810> kind<00:04:18.959> of<00:04:19.049> cheapened<00:04:19.620> it<00:04:19.769> a<00:04:19.799> little

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
she just kind of cheapened it a little

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:21.949 
she just kind of cheapened it a little
bit<00:04:20.190> by<00:04:20.400> throwing<00:04:20.820> that<00:04:21.090> romance<00:04:21.539> in<00:04:21.750> there

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
bit by throwing that romance in there

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.060 
bit by throwing that romance in there
and<00:04:22.500> I<00:04:22.680> don't

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
and I don't

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.400 
and I don't
think<00:04:23.250> it<00:04:23.370> needed<00:04:23.580> it<00:04:23.850> to<00:04:24.030> be<00:04:24.060> honest<00:04:24.420> so

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
think it needed it to be honest so

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.480 
think it needed it to be honest so
that's<00:04:25.590> my<00:04:25.740> review<00:04:25.890> for<00:04:26.070> the<00:04:26.220> skies
