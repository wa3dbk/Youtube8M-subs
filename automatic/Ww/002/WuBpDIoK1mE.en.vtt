my<00:00:35.340> hair<00:00:35.579> what<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:36.030> I'm<00:00:36.469> not<00:00:37.469> completely<00:00:37.860> dry

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
my hair what is I'm not completely dry

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.049 
my hair what is I'm not completely dry
but<00:00:39.950> close<00:00:40.950> enough<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.370> dry<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:41.910> when<00:00:42.030> i

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
but close enough to dry so that when i

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.369 
but close enough to dry so that when i
said<00:00:42.329> i<00:00:42.360> don't<00:00:42.540> have<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.870> wait<00:00:43.020> for<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.290> to

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
said i don't have to wait for it to

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.440 
said i don't have to wait for it to
completely<00:00:43.620> air<00:00:44.070> dry<00:00:44.250> overnight<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:45.300> it's

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
completely air dry overnight and so it's

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.010 
completely air dry overnight and so it's
a<00:00:45.629> just<00:00:46.050> easier<00:00:46.610> for<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.789> setting<00:00:48.059> time<00:00:48.270> what

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
a just easier for the setting time what

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.979 
a just easier for the setting time what
I'm<00:00:49.110> doing<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:50.010> banding<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:51.510> in<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.809> four

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
I'm doing is banding so in the four

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.900 
I'm doing is banding so in the four
sections<00:00:52.440> I'm<00:00:52.739> just<00:00:53.219> grabbing<00:00:53.489> each<00:00:53.850> one<00:00:54.210> and

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
sections I'm just grabbing each one and

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:02.349 
sections I'm just grabbing each one and

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
putting a hair tie right at the base

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:09.039 
putting a hair tie right at the base
like<00:01:03.359> this<00:01:03.690> just<00:01:04.049> like<00:01:04.140> any<00:01:04.470> other<00:01:05.180> ponytail

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
that's the first band and the reason why

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.810 
that's the first band and the reason why
I'm<00:01:15.960> doing<00:01:16.020> this<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.920> stretches<00:01:17.580> out

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
I'm doing this is it it stretches out

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.109 
I'm doing this is it it stretches out
your<00:01:18.420> curl<00:01:19.100> so<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.280> after<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.670> wash<00:01:20.880> your

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
your curl so that after you wash your

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.730 
your curl so that after you wash your
hair<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.869> know<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.080> don't<00:01:22.229> get<00:01:22.350> all<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.710> that

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
hair you know you don't get all of that

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.580 
hair you know you don't get all of that
shrinkage<00:01:23.479> so<00:01:24.479> people<00:01:24.869> say<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.170> then<00:01:25.350> has<00:01:25.439> an

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
shrinkage so people say that then has an

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.990 
shrinkage so people say that then has an
idea<00:01:25.799> about<00:01:25.860> shrinkage<00:01:26.310> they're<00:01:26.520> actually<00:01:26.880> as

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
idea about shrinkage they're actually as

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.440 
idea about shrinkage they're actually as
it<00:01:27.150> just<00:01:27.299> takes<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.479> little<00:01:27.600> bit<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:27.780> work<00:01:27.900> and

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
it just takes a little bit of work and

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.730 
it just takes a little bit of work and
so<00:01:30.450> when<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:30.780> take<00:01:31.079> this<00:01:31.200> out<00:01:31.350> tomorrow<00:01:31.530> it's

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
lighting is kind of weird

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:18.149 
lighting is kind of weird
I<00:02:12.090> mean<00:02:13.090> it<00:02:13.180> was<00:02:14.670> ok<00:02:16.620> I'm<00:02:17.620> going<00:02:17.769> to<00:02:17.860> go<00:02:17.950> down

I mean it was ok I'm going to go down

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:24.929 
I mean it was ok I'm going to go down

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:24.939 
the strand of hair and as I each time

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:27.089 
the strand of hair and as I each time
that<00:02:25.120> I<00:02:25.180> put<00:02:25.959> the<00:02:26.109> band<00:02:26.290> down<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.709> length<00:02:26.890> I'm

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
that I put the band down the length I'm

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.309 
that I put the band down the length I'm
pulling<00:02:27.549> the<00:02:27.790> hair<00:02:28.359> taught<00:02:28.629> so<00:02:28.900> let's<00:02:29.049> see<00:02:29.290> how

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
pulling the hair taught so let's see how

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.860 
pulling the hair taught so let's see how
it's<00:02:29.530> squished<00:02:29.739> up<00:02:29.890> I'm<00:02:30.069> pulling<00:02:30.459> it<00:02:30.659> so<00:02:31.659> that

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
it's squished up I'm pulling it so that

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.319 
it's squished up I'm pulling it so that
it<00:02:32.079> straightens<00:02:32.590> it<00:02:32.680> out<00:02:32.769> a<00:02:32.829> little<00:02:33.069> bit<00:02:33.329> to

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:34.329 
it straightens it out a little bit to

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:36.089 
it straightens it out a little bit to
elongate<00:02:34.599> the<00:02:34.900> curl<00:02:35.140> so<00:02:35.769> I'm<00:02:35.829> going<00:02:35.950> to<00:02:36.010> take

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
elongate the curl so I'm going to take

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:37.289 
elongate the curl so I'm going to take
this<00:02:36.280> out<00:02:36.489> now<00:02:36.519> because<00:02:36.849> I<00:02:36.939> didn't<00:02:37.150> finish

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
will be alternating between hot heat and

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.920 
will be alternating between hot heat and
using<00:03:40.989> the<00:03:41.139> cold<00:03:41.620> cool<00:03:41.979> shot<00:03:42.250> button<00:03:42.280> ok<00:03:43.180> so

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
using the cold cool shot button ok so

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:55.410 
using the cold cool shot button ok so
i'll<00:03:43.989> just<00:03:44.049> show<00:03:44.260> you<00:03:44.290> how<00:03:44.440> I<00:03:44.500> do<00:03:44.590> it

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.240 

also<00:03:56.420> I<00:03:56.450> wanted<00:03:56.660> to<00:03:56.780> say<00:03:56.960> i<00:03:57.170> started<00:03:57.770> the<00:03:57.920> roots

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
also I wanted to say i started the roots

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.300 
also I wanted to say i started the roots
because<00:03:58.910> i<00:03:59.240> don't<00:03:59.450> really<00:03:59.540> care<00:03:59.870> if<00:03:59.900> the<00:04:00.380> ends

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
because i don't really care if the ends

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.950 
because i don't really care if the ends
are<00:04:01.370> dry<00:04:01.550> because<00:04:01.730> ends<00:04:02.090> always<00:04:02.240> drive<00:04:02.480> faster

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:02.960 
are dry because ends always drive faster

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.720 
are dry because ends always drive faster
than<00:04:03.200> the<00:04:03.740> hair<00:04:03.890> that's<00:04:04.040> closest<00:04:04.490> to<00:04:04.550> the

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
than the hair that's closest to the

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.090 
than the hair that's closest to the
scalp<00:04:04.970> so<00:04:05.180> i<00:04:05.210> always<00:04:05.420> start<00:04:05.660> at<00:04:06.020> the<00:04:06.440> top<00:04:06.620> when

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
scalp so i always start at the top when

00:04:07.100 --> 00:05:08.210 
scalp so i always start at the top when
i<00:04:07.130> do<00:04:07.220> this<00:04:07.540> okay<00:04:08.560> here<00:04:09.560> we<00:04:09.590> go

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.850 

you

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.960 

okay<00:05:13.860> so<00:05:13.919> that's<00:05:14.100> pretty<00:05:14.250> much<00:05:14.340> all<00:05:14.610> I'm<00:05:14.790> going

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
okay so that's pretty much all I'm going

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.550 
okay so that's pretty much all I'm going
to<00:05:15.060> do<00:05:15.270> and<00:05:15.480> as<00:05:15.570> you<00:05:15.720> can<00:05:15.840> see<00:05:15.870> I<00:05:16.020> didn't<00:05:16.290> get<00:05:16.440> it

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
to do and as you can see I didn't get it

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.400 
to do and as you can see I didn't get it
straight<00:05:17.060> and<00:05:18.060> it's<00:05:18.240> not<00:05:18.510> completely<00:05:19.050> dry

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
straight and it's not completely dry

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.719 
straight and it's not completely dry
either<00:05:20.419> I<00:05:21.530> should<00:05:22.530> also<00:05:22.620> mention<00:05:22.830> that<00:05:23.190> I

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:23.729 
either I should also mention that I

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:25.659 
either I should also mention that I
didn't<00:05:24.270> comb<00:05:24.570> through<00:05:24.900> my<00:05:24.990> hair<00:05:25.139> to<00:05:25.470> detangle

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
didn't comb through my hair to detangle

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:28.430 
didn't comb through my hair to detangle
