00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
moves as far as how the the computer is

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.670 
moves as far as how the the computer is
going<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.880> go<00:01:27.000> in<00:01:27.150> one<00:01:27.420> second<00:01:27.869> so<00:01:27.990> not<00:01:28.229> very

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
going to go in one second so not very

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.219 
going to go in one second so not very
long<00:01:28.950> again<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.850> computer<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.630> lot<00:01:30.960> smarter

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
long again the computer is a lot smarter

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.460 
long again the computer is a lot smarter
than<00:01:31.439> humans<00:01:31.820> but<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:33.450> know<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.810> one<00:01:34.049> second

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.929 
than humans but you know in one second
you<00:01:34.590> can't<00:01:34.829> do<00:01:34.920> too<00:01:35.100> much<00:01:35.130> but<00:01:35.549> again<00:01:35.729> you're

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
you can't do too much but again you're

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.039 
you can't do too much but again you're
still<00:01:36.180> going<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.360> get<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.540> pretty<00:01:36.780> solid

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
still going to get a pretty solid

analysis<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.650> gives<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:40.979> strength

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
analysis and it gives you a strength

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.469

strength<00:01:43.079> evaluation<00:01:43.619> score<00:01:43.860> plus<00:01:44.220> means

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
strength evaluation score plus means

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.850 
strength evaluation score plus means
that<00:01:44.759> why<00:01:44.939> does<00:01:45.119> ahead<00:01:45.450> minus<00:01:46.320> means<00:01:46.590> that

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
that why does ahead minus means that

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.370 
that why does ahead minus means that
black<00:01:47.100> is<00:01:47.130> ahead<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.820> whole<00:01:48.329> point<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:49.140> is

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
black is ahead a whole point that is

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.370 
black is ahead a whole point that is
meaning<00:01:49.890> why<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.759> up<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.299> pawn<00:01:51.659> in<00:01:51.689> material

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
meaning why it is up a pawn in material

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.389 
meaning why it is up a pawn in material
now<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.680> doesn't<00:01:52.920> always<00:01:53.040> have<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.280> be

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
now it doesn't always have to be

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.550 
now it doesn't always have to be
material<00:01:54.030> advantage<00:01:54.360> sometimes<00:01:54.570> if<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.049> you

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
material advantage sometimes if you you

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.810 
material advantage sometimes if you you
know<00:01:55.590> if<00:01:55.740> you're<00:01:55.890> about<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.159> checkmate<00:01:56.430> you're

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
know if you're about to checkmate you're

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.510 
know if you're about to checkmate you're
going<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.000> have<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.180> very<00:01:57.570> high<00:01:57.780> point<00:01:58.560> even<00:01:59.430> if

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
going to have a very high point even if

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.340 
going to have a very high point even if
you<00:01:59.640> don't<00:01:59.850> have<00:02:00.030> more<00:02:00.329> material<00:02:00.479> but<00:02:01.110> again

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
you don't have more material but again

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.990 
you don't have more material but again
it's<00:02:01.530> just<00:02:01.710> kind<00:02:01.890> of<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:02.009> gauge<00:02:02.219> as<00:02:02.460> far<00:02:02.640> as<00:02:02.759> who

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
it's just kind of a gauge as far as who

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.060 
it's just kind of a gauge as far as who
is<00:02:03.180> winning<00:02:03.450> in<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.840> game<00:02:04.560> because<00:02:04.829> again

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
is winning in the game because again

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.020 
is winning in the game because again
it's<00:02:05.219> not<00:02:05.310> always<00:02:05.490> who<00:02:05.729> has<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.939> most

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
it's not always who has the most

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.029 
it's not always who has the most
material<00:02:06.509> it's<00:02:06.840> who<00:02:07.110> has<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.380> most<00:02:07.500> material

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
material it's who has the most material

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.100 
material it's who has the most material
actually<00:02:08.940> in<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.360> battle<00:02:09.660> but<00:02:09.780> this<00:02:09.899> with

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
actually in the battle but this with

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.570 
actually in the battle but this with
your<00:02:10.319> case<00:02:10.560> both<00:02:10.830> sides<00:02:11.099> are<00:02:11.220> pretty<00:02:11.400> equal

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
your case both sides are pretty equal

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.530 
your case both sides are pretty equal
zero<00:02:12.000> point<00:02:12.270> zero

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
zero point zero

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.509 
zero point zero
would<00:02:12.629> be<00:02:12.750> complete<00:02:13.319> equality<00:02:13.709> and<00:02:14.129> both

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
would be complete equality and both

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.220 
would be complete equality and both
sides<00:02:14.790> are<00:02:14.939> pretty<00:02:15.180> equal<00:02:15.360> they<00:02:15.629> have<00:02:15.810> kind<00:02:16.110> of

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
sides are pretty equal they have kind of

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.929 
sides are pretty equal they have kind of
the<00:02:16.349> same<00:02:16.500> setup<00:02:16.829> it<00:02:17.040> is<00:02:17.159> White's<00:02:17.400> move<00:02:17.640> so

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:17.939 
the same setup it is White's move so

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:20.809 
the same setup it is White's move so
sure<00:02:18.510> slight<00:02:18.870> advantage<00:02:19.280> 0.1<00:02:20.280> sounds<00:02:20.640> about

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
sure slight advantage 0.1 sounds about

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.759 
sure slight advantage 0.1 sounds about
right<00:02:20.849> it<00:02:21.420> also<00:02:21.540> has<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:21.840> recommended<00:02:22.409> line<00:02:22.560> for

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
right it also has a recommended line for

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.110 
right it also has a recommended line for
white<00:02:22.890> again<00:02:23.159> this<00:02:23.250> is<00:02:23.430> what<00:02:23.640> a<00:02:23.670> lot<00:02:23.939> of<00:02:24.000> people

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
white again this is what a lot of people

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.149 
white again this is what a lot of people
ask<00:02:24.510> how<00:02:24.780> should<00:02:25.170> white<00:02:25.409> continue<00:02:26.010> in

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
ask how should white continue in

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:28.490 
ask how should white continue in
whatever<00:02:26.730> position<00:02:27.090> it<00:02:27.510> is<00:02:27.629> or<00:02:27.900> how<00:02:28.079> black

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
should continue in a position it gives

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.720

you<00:02:30.689> recommended<00:02:31.170> line<00:02:31.319> this<00:02:31.560> has<00:02:31.769> four<00:02:32.220> lines

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
you recommended line this has four lines

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.509 
you recommended line this has four lines
or<00:02:33.480> four<00:02:33.870> moves<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.470> so<00:02:34.620> if<00:02:34.980> you<00:02:35.040> click<00:02:35.310> on

recommended line it you can actually

strength evaluation is not going to

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.259 
strength evaluation is not going to

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
change as you go through this but you

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.270 
change as you go through this but you
could<00:02:42.420> always<00:02:42.569> you<00:02:42.900> know<00:02:43.049> actually<00:02:43.590> do<00:02:44.010> the

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
could always you know actually do the

could always you know actually do the

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
strength evaluation of this right here

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.750 
strength evaluation of this right here
if<00:02:46.349> you<00:02:46.470> wanted<00:02:46.709> to<00:02:46.859> even<00:02:47.099> go<00:02:47.189> deeper<00:02:47.549> from

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
if you wanted to even go deeper from

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.970 
if you wanted to even go deeper from
this<00:02:48.000> position<00:02:48.180> we<00:02:49.079> can<00:02:49.200> always<00:02:49.319> come<00:02:49.620> back<00:02:49.650> we

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
this position we can always come back we

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.129 
this position we can always come back we
can<00:02:50.129> change<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:50.790> strength<00:02:51.060> of<00:02:51.209> our<00:02:51.389> the<00:02:51.659> time

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:52.139 
can change the strength of our the time

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:55.000 
can change the strength of our the time
limit<00:02:52.530> so<00:02:52.650> if<00:02:53.459> we<00:02:53.639> come<00:02:53.939> back<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.329> the<00:02:54.450> board

we'll go ahead and click will do five

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:00.379 
we'll go ahead and click will do five
seconds<00:02:58.260> here<00:02:58.500> and<00:02:58.680> we'll<00:02:59.430> click<00:02:59.819> back<00:03:00.000> on<00:03:00.209> the

and click analyze and again before we

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:07.699 
and click analyze and again before we
did<00:03:05.489> one<00:03:05.849> second<00:03:06.329> it<00:03:06.450> gave<00:03:06.629> us<00:03:06.780> four<00:03:07.079> moves<00:03:07.409> and

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
did one second it gave us four moves and

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.339 
did one second it gave us four moves and
we<00:03:07.769> click<00:03:08.040> on<00:03:08.220> analyze<00:03:08.639> this<00:03:09.000> time<00:03:09.349> same

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
we click on analyze this time same

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.020 
we click on analyze this time same
strength<00:03:10.680> evaluation<00:03:11.280> so<00:03:11.459> again<00:03:11.730> still

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
strength evaluation so again still

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.300 
strength evaluation so again still
pretty<00:03:12.419> much<00:03:12.620> equality<00:03:13.620> but<00:03:13.739> it<00:03:13.859> gives<00:03:14.010> you<00:03:14.280> a

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
pretty much equality but it gives you a

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.670 
pretty much equality but it gives you a
different<00:03:15.000> line<00:03:15.389> so<00:03:15.689> it's<00:03:15.870> again<00:03:16.290> it's<00:03:16.349> got<00:03:16.650> a

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
different line so it's again it's got a

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.080 
different line so it's again it's got a
little<00:03:16.859> more<00:03:17.069> in-depth<00:03:17.370> we've<00:03:17.609> gone<00:03:17.790> a<00:03:17.819> few

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
little more in-depth we've gone a few

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.360 
little more in-depth we've gone a few
more<00:03:18.239> seconds<00:03:18.720> and<00:03:18.900> we've<00:03:19.470> now<00:03:19.680> got<00:03:19.979> five

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
more seconds and we've now got five

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.009 
more seconds and we've now got five
moves<00:03:20.729> you<00:03:20.970> can<00:03:21.120> actually<00:03:21.299> click<00:03:21.629> on<00:03:21.780> this<00:03:21.959> and

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
moves you can actually click on this and

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.879 
moves you can actually click on this and
go<00:03:22.319> through<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:23.280> five<00:03:23.489> moves<00:03:23.849> so<00:03:24.840> again<00:03:25.290> you

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
go through the five moves so again you

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:28.309 
go through the five moves so again you
know<00:03:26.010> pretty<00:03:26.459> pretty<00:03:26.940> cool<00:03:27.180> stuff<00:03:27.540> so<00:03:28.019> again

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
know pretty pretty cool stuff so again

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.050 
know pretty pretty cool stuff so again
that<00:03:28.650> is<00:03:28.949> kind<00:03:29.220> of<00:03:29.280> what<00:03:29.340> it<00:03:29.519> looks<00:03:29.729> like<00:03:29.849> if

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
that is kind of what it looks like if

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.020 
that is kind of what it looks like if
you<00:03:30.180> set<00:03:30.540> it<00:03:30.659> up<00:03:30.810> from<00:03:31.290> you<00:03:31.769> know<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.459> very

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:48.449 
add it so we'll go ahead and add a

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:50.990 
add it so we'll go ahead and add a
couple<00:03:49.109> rooks<00:03:49.530> I'll<00:03:50.310> go<00:03:50.579> ahead<00:03:50.699> and<00:03:50.819> add<00:03:50.970> a

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
couple rooks I'll go ahead and add a

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.729 
couple rooks I'll go ahead and add a
pond<00:03:51.359> over<00:03:51.690> here<00:03:51.930> for<00:03:52.109> Whiteside<00:03:52.470> but<00:03:52.620> let's

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
pond over here for Whiteside but let's

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.199 
pond over here for Whiteside but let's
go<00:03:52.859> ahead<00:03:52.889> and<00:03:53.040> change<00:03:53.280> White's<00:03:53.639> move<00:03:53.940> to

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
go ahead and change White's move to

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.050 
go ahead and change White's move to
black<00:03:54.540> to<00:03:54.750> move<00:03:54.930> so<00:03:55.769> it's<00:03:55.919> blacks<00:03:56.189> to<00:03:56.400> move<00:03:56.669> and

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
black to move so it's blacks to move and

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.899 
black to move so it's blacks to move and
we'll<00:03:57.810> click<00:03:58.079> analyze<00:03:58.430> again<00:03:59.430> we'll<00:03:59.579> keep<00:03:59.760> it

00:03:59.899 --> 00:03:59.909 
we'll click analyze again we'll keep it

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:01.429 
we'll click analyze again we'll keep it
on<00:04:00.030> the<00:04:00.180> five<00:04:00.419> seconds<00:04:00.959> just<00:04:01.109> to<00:04:01.260> see

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:01.439 
on the five seconds just to see

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:02.780 
on the five seconds just to see
hopefully<00:04:01.709> it's<00:04:01.979> going<00:04:02.099> to<00:04:02.189> tell<00:04:02.400> us<00:04:02.430> to<00:04:02.609> take

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
hopefully it's going to tell us to take

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.939 
hopefully it's going to tell us to take
this<00:04:02.909> rook<00:04:03.150> here<00:04:03.329> on<00:04:03.449> a<00:04:03.479> one<00:04:03.840> and<00:04:04.049> it<00:04:04.470> does<00:04:04.709> so

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:04.949 
this rook here on a one and it does so

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:07.879 
this rook here on a one and it does so
again<00:04:05.430> dot<00:04:06.060> dot<00:04:06.239> dot<00:04:06.419> means<00:04:06.659> it's<00:04:06.930> now<00:04:07.079> blacks

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889 
again dot dot dot means it's now blacks

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:10.809 
again dot dot dot means it's now blacks
move<00:04:08.159> so<00:04:08.430> strength<00:04:09.030> evaluation<00:04:09.689> negative<00:04:10.319> 5.4

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
move so strength evaluation negative 5.4

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:13.520 
move so strength evaluation negative 5.4
that<00:04:11.819> means<00:04:12.030> blackheads<00:04:12.629> definitely<00:04:13.229> ahead

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
that means blackheads definitely ahead

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.180 
that means blackheads definitely ahead
even<00:04:14.459> though<00:04:14.609> he's<00:04:14.970> you<00:04:15.959> know<00:04:15.989> same<00:04:16.409> material

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
even though he's you know same material

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.310 
even though he's you know same material
right<00:04:17.340> now<00:04:17.519> he's<00:04:17.970> about<00:04:18.150> to<00:04:18.389> take<00:04:18.509> material<00:04:19.049> so

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
right now he's about to take material so

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.229 
right now he's about to take material so
definitely<00:04:19.739> an<00:04:19.829> advantage<00:04:20.009> and<00:04:20.400> as<00:04:20.849> it<00:04:21.090> goes

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
definitely an advantage and as it goes

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.000 
definitely an advantage and as it goes
on<00:04:21.479> while<00:04:21.900> this<00:04:22.049> strength<00:04:22.289> evaluation<00:04:22.860> won't

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
on while this strength evaluation won't

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.879 
on while this strength evaluation won't
change<00:04:23.360> black<00:04:24.360> strength<00:04:24.719> evaluation<00:04:25.289> will

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
change black strength evaluation will

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:28.040 
change black strength evaluation will
technically<00:04:26.729> still<00:04:27.120> be<00:04:27.389> going<00:04:27.569> up<00:04:27.870> because

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
technically still be going up because

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.659 
technically still be going up because
he'll<00:04:28.379> have<00:04:28.590> you<00:04:28.949> know<00:04:29.039> a<00:04:29.069> much<00:04:29.400> better

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
he'll have you know a much better

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.700 
he'll have you know a much better
position<00:04:29.879> in<00:04:30.240> the<00:04:30.300> game<00:04:30.479> so<00:04:30.719> again<00:04:31.439> we<00:04:31.560> can

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
position in the game so again we can

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.409 
position in the game so again we can
kind<00:04:31.830> of<00:04:31.919> go<00:04:32.039> through<00:04:32.069> it<00:04:32.370> and<00:04:32.520> so<00:04:32.939> we<00:04:33.120> can<00:04:33.240> say

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
kind of go through it and so we can say

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.600 
kind of go through it and so we can say
you<00:04:33.479> know<00:04:33.659> it<00:04:33.780> takes<00:04:33.990> that<00:04:34.199> pond<00:04:34.469> and<00:04:35.430> then<00:04:35.520> it

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
you know it takes that pond and then it

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.670 
you know it takes that pond and then it
kind<00:04:35.819> of<00:04:35.879> guides<00:04:36.090> you<00:04:36.330> through<00:04:36.469> again<00:04:37.469> this<00:04:37.620> is

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
kind of guides you through again this is

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.589 
kind of guides you through again this is
all<00:04:37.889> contingent<00:04:38.460> on<00:04:38.550> how<00:04:39.029> the<00:04:39.090> computers

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:39.599 
all contingent on how the computers

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:42.050 
all contingent on how the computers
running<00:04:40.050> through<00:04:40.319> it<00:04:40.439> but<00:04:40.650> going<00:04:41.550> through<00:04:41.909> all

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
running through it but going through all

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.980 
running through it but going through all
these<00:04:42.150> different<00:04:42.360> moves<00:04:42.689> and<00:04:42.900> then

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
these different moves and then

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.409 
these different moves and then
eventually<00:04:43.310> you<00:04:44.310> know<00:04:44.340> black<00:04:44.699> would<00:04:45.240> take

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
eventually you know black would take

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:48.469 
eventually you know black would take
material<00:04:45.990> and<00:04:46.800> then<00:04:46.949> go<00:04:47.310> on<00:04:47.340> to<00:04:47.759> checkmate<00:04:48.210> his

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
material and then go on to checkmate his

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.839 
material and then go on to checkmate his
opponent<00:04:48.930> so<00:04:49.050> again<00:04:49.560> this<00:04:49.680> is<00:04:49.889> extremely

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:50.849 
opponent so again this is extremely

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:53.149 
opponent so again this is extremely
extremely<00:04:51.689> powerful<00:04:52.110> stuff<00:04:52.680> that<00:04:53.039> I<00:04:53.069> think

00:04:53.149 --> 00:04:53.159 
extremely powerful stuff that I think

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:54.709 
extremely powerful stuff that I think
you<00:04:53.460> guys<00:04:53.610> are<00:04:53.849> really<00:04:53.879> going<00:04:54.210> to<00:04:54.270> joy<00:04:54.509> and

00:04:54.709 --> 00:04:54.719 
you guys are really going to joy and

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:56.659 
you guys are really going to joy and

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
moves it kind of looks like this so you

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.029 
moves it kind of looks like this so you
know<00:05:53.610> pretty<00:05:53.849> basic<00:05:54.149> this<00:05:55.110> I<00:05:55.439> basically<00:05:55.800> just

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:56.039 
know pretty basic this I basically just

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:58.279 
know pretty basic this I basically just
copied<00:05:56.580> one<00:05:56.939> of<00:05:57.060> the<00:05:57.210> the<00:05:57.509> more<00:05:57.659> famous<00:05:57.899> games

00:05:58.279 --> 00:05:58.289

copied one of the the more famous games
out<00:05:58.529> there<00:05:58.560> but<00:05:59.520> you<00:05:59.639> could<00:05:59.819> do<00:05:59.939> it<00:05:59.969> with<00:06:00.180> just

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210 
out there but you could do it with just

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.540 
out there but you could do it with just
the<00:06:00.449> moves<00:06:00.629> orders<00:06:00.960> you<00:06:01.050> know<00:06:01.199> one<00:06:01.529> dot<00:06:02.219> and

move you can definitely change this if

right<00:06:19.560> away<00:06:19.830> it<00:06:19.979> already<00:06:20.370> gives<00:06:20.520> you<00:06:20.879> the

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:21.389 
right away it already gives you the

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:23.300 
right away it already gives you the

strength evaluation and recommended line

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.159 
strength evaluation and recommended line
and<00:06:23.520> you<00:06:23.610> can<00:06:23.789> go<00:06:23.969> through<00:06:24.000> the<00:06:24.479> entire<00:06:24.599> game

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:25.169

and<00:06:25.229> this<00:06:25.469> is<00:06:25.620> very<00:06:25.800> powerful<00:06:26.039> because<00:06:26.310> you

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 
and this is very powerful because you

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.129 
and this is very powerful because you
know<00:06:27.210> in<00:06:27.300> this<00:06:27.419> particular<00:06:27.569> case<00:06:27.960> the

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:28.139 
know in this particular case the

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:29.240 
know in this particular case the
strength<00:06:28.409> evaluation<00:06:28.919> is<00:06:28.979> not<00:06:29.099> going<00:06:29.189> to

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:29.250 
strength evaluation is not going to

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:30.559 
strength evaluation is not going to
change<00:06:29.310> two<00:06:29.669> months<00:06:29.939> because<00:06:30.180> we<00:06:30.300> have<00:06:30.389> two

00:06:30.559 --> 00:06:30.569 
change two months because we have two

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:32.269 
change two months because we have two
Grand<00:06:30.990> Master's<00:06:31.469> that<00:06:31.680> are<00:06:31.770> actually<00:06:32.069> playing

00:06:32.269 --> 00:06:32.279 
Grand Master's that are actually playing

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:34.070 
Grand Master's that are actually playing
against<00:06:32.490> each<00:06:32.580> other<00:06:32.819> but<00:06:33.360> in<00:06:33.479> your<00:06:33.629> own<00:06:33.659> games

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 
against each other but in your own games

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.350 
against each other but in your own games
you're<00:06:34.259> going<00:06:34.379> to<00:06:34.440> see<00:06:34.589> some<00:06:34.769> very<00:06:35.459> very<00:06:36.000> large

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 
you're going to see some very very large

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.180 
you're going to see some very very large
swings<00:06:36.750> in<00:06:36.990> the<00:06:37.080> strength<00:06:37.349> evaluation<00:06:37.979> so<00:06:38.099> you

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:38.190 
swings in the strength evaluation so you

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:38.870 
swings in the strength evaluation so you
can<00:06:38.339> actually<00:06:38.459> go

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880 
can actually go

know these people actually decided to do
exactly<00:07:00.750> what<00:07:00.990> the<00:07:01.200> computer<00:07:01.530> said<00:07:01.920> but<00:07:02.130> in

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:02.280 
exactly what the computer said but in

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.650 
exactly what the computer said but in
your<00:07:02.400> own<00:07:02.430> games<00:07:02.790> you<00:07:03.000> can<00:07:03.150> look<00:07:03.270> at<00:07:03.420> and<00:07:03.540> say

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:03.660 
your own games you can look at and say

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.110 
your own games you can look at and say

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:06.120 
oh wow white swimming and then the next

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.690 
oh wow white swimming and then the next
move<00:07:06.540> wow<00:07:06.900> black<00:07:07.230> is<00:07:07.470> winning<00:07:07.770> by<00:07:07.920> a<00:07:07.950> lot<00:07:08.280> that

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:08.700 
move wow black is winning by a lot that

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:09.920 
move wow black is winning by a lot that
was<00:07:08.850> maybe<00:07:09.060> a<00:07:09.180> bad<00:07:09.390> move<00:07:09.570> and<00:07:09.660> you<00:07:09.780> can

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:09.930 
was maybe a bad move and you can

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.320 
was maybe a bad move and you can
actually<00:07:10.200> go<00:07:10.350> through<00:07:10.380> and<00:07:10.860> again<00:07:11.370> do<00:07:12.300> the

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:12.330 
actually go through and again do the

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.180 
actually go through and again do the
recommended<00:07:12.930> line<00:07:13.110> and<00:07:13.320> actually<00:07:13.620> see<00:07:13.890> what

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:14.190 
recommended line and actually see what

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:15.830 
recommended line and actually see what
the<00:07:14.340> computer<00:07:14.850> recommends<00:07:15.450> in<00:07:15.540> that<00:07:15.660> position

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 
the computer recommends in that position

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.260 
the computer recommends in that position
so<00:07:16.230> very<00:07:16.590> very<00:07:16.860> powerful<00:07:17.070> you<00:07:17.400> can<00:07:17.430> also<00:07:17.820> again

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:18.270 
so very very powerful you can also again

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.990 
so very very powerful you can also again
change<00:07:18.780> your<00:07:19.500> parameter<00:07:20.310> so<00:07:20.460> you<00:07:20.520> can<00:07:20.760> change

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.000 
change your parameter so you can change

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.790 
change your parameter so you can change
time<00:07:21.480> limit<00:07:21.810> you<00:07:21.900> can<00:07:21.930> change<00:07:22.290> the<00:07:22.590> search

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:22.800 
time limit you can change the search

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.290 
time limit you can change the search
step<00:07:23.100> although<00:07:23.400> I<00:07:23.430> think<00:07:23.580> 20<00:07:23.970> moves<00:07:24.150> is

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:24.300 
step although I think 20 moves is

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:25.730 
step although I think 20 moves is
actually<00:07:24.630> pretty<00:07:24.810> solid<00:07:25.170> you<00:07:25.470> can<00:07:25.590> always

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:25.740 
actually pretty solid you can always

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.860 
actually pretty solid you can always
change<00:07:26.100> that<00:07:26.490> the<00:07:26.640> time<00:07:26.880> limit<00:07:27.210> for<00:07:27.240> each<00:07:27.570> move

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:27.870 
change that the time limit for each move

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:29.390 
change that the time limit for each move
that<00:07:28.410> it<00:07:28.530> goes<00:07:28.680> through<00:07:28.710> if<00:07:29.010> you<00:07:29.130> want<00:07:29.340> a
