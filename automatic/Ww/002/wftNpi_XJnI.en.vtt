00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
so that's how we're doing here Julie Ann

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.050 
so that's how we're doing here Julie Ann
Waddell<00:02:39.230> gave<00:02:39.620> up<00:02:39.800> her<00:02:39.980> life<00:02:40.010> behind<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:40.820> desk

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
Waddell gave up her life behind the desk

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.540 
Waddell gave up her life behind the desk
designing<00:02:42.019> high-end<00:02:42.620> children's<00:02:43.220> clothes

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
designing high-end children's clothes

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.290 
designing high-end children's clothes
and<00:02:43.910> uprooted<00:02:44.750> her<00:02:44.780> two<00:02:45.140> teenaged<00:02:45.650> kids<00:02:46.269> for<00:02:47.269> a

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
and uprooted her two teenaged kids for a

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:54.490 
and uprooted her two teenaged kids for a
new<00:02:47.600> slice<00:02:47.930> of<00:02:48.320> life<00:02:52.690> to<00:02:53.690> learn<00:02:53.870> how<00:02:54.170> to<00:02:54.200> farm

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
new slice of life to learn how to farm

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.820 
new slice of life to learn how to farm
yeah<00:02:54.860> yeah<00:02:55.550> I<00:02:55.910> think<00:02:56.810> it's<00:02:57.019> very<00:02:57.200> important

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
yeah yeah I think it's very important

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.850 
yeah yeah I think it's very important
and<00:02:58.540> for<00:02:59.540> everyone<00:02:59.959> but<00:03:00.170> especially<00:03:00.410> this

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
and for everyone but especially this

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.680 
and for everyone but especially this
next<00:03:01.220> generation<00:03:01.790> that's<00:03:01.940> coming<00:03:02.060> up<00:03:02.420> for

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
next generation that's coming up for

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.060 
next generation that's coming up for
them<00:03:02.810> to<00:03:02.840> understand<00:03:03.500> where<00:03:03.680> their<00:03:03.890> food

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
them to understand where their food

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.890 
them to understand where their food
comes<00:03:04.340> from<00:03:04.519> and<00:03:04.880> be<00:03:05.120> connected<00:03:05.420> to<00:03:05.750> their

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
comes from and be connected to their

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.490 
comes from and be connected to their
food<00:03:06.080> source<00:03:06.140> and<00:03:07.480> I<00:03:08.480> think<00:03:09.019> that<00:03:09.230> is

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
food source and I think that is

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.530 
food source and I think that is
unfortunately<00:03:10.459> something<00:03:10.760> that<00:03:11.150> we've<00:03:11.300> lost

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
unfortunately something that we've lost

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.770 
unfortunately something that we've lost
in<00:03:11.840> in<00:03:12.230> just<00:03:12.470> a<00:03:12.650> very<00:03:12.860> short<00:03:13.160> amount<00:03:13.400> of<00:03:13.489> time

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.050 

cleared<00:03:18.780> out<00:03:18.870> all<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.230> old<00:03:19.490> dead<00:03:20.490> canes<00:03:20.850> that

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
cleared out all the old dead canes that

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.910 
cleared out all the old dead canes that
have<00:03:21.210> already<00:03:21.330> fruited<00:03:21.750> for<00:03:21.960> us<00:03:22.110> that<00:03:22.830> make

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
have already fruited for us that make

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.880 
have already fruited for us that make
