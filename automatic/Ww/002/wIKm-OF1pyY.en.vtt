00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
who you are we're not just a number here

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.429 
who you are we're not just a number here
or<00:03:01.700> we're<00:03:02.120> actually<00:03:02.299> an<00:03:02.599> individual<00:03:03.049> person

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:03.439 
or we're actually an individual person

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:05.949 
or we're actually an individual person
and<00:03:03.470> they<00:03:04.189> care<00:03:04.519> how<00:03:04.700> well<00:03:04.879> we<00:03:05.000> do<00:03:05.150> and<00:03:05.390> how<00:03:05.930> we

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
and they care how well we do and how we

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.099 
and they care how well we do and how we
succeed<00:03:06.590> and<00:03:07.030> that<00:03:08.030> makes<00:03:08.359> a<00:03:08.480> difference<00:03:08.689> in

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:09.109 
succeed and that makes a difference in

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:11.050 
succeed and that makes a difference in
the<00:03:09.200> kind<00:03:09.409> of<00:03:09.590> doctors<00:03:10.040> these<00:03:10.280> students<00:03:10.849> will

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
the kind of doctors these students will

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.920 
the kind of doctors these students will
become<00:03:12.489> so<00:03:13.489> I<00:03:13.519> think<00:03:13.579> the<00:03:13.790> students<00:03:14.090> from<00:03:14.239> UMHS

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
become so I think the students from UMHS

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.780 
become so I think the students from UMHS
are<00:03:15.109> really<00:03:15.470> well<00:03:15.680> prepared<00:03:15.859> not<00:03:16.430> only<00:03:16.489> in

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
are really well prepared not only in

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.190 
are really well prepared not only in
terms<00:03:16.819> of<00:03:17.090> their<00:03:17.209> clinical<00:03:17.659> knowledge<00:03:17.810> but

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
terms of their clinical knowledge but

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.640 
terms of their clinical knowledge but
what<00:03:18.500> I've<00:03:18.590> been<00:03:18.829> so<00:03:19.129> impressed<00:03:19.250> with<00:03:19.760> is<00:03:19.970> how

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
what I've been so impressed with is how

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.500 
what I've been so impressed with is how
kind<00:03:21.650> of<00:03:21.769> humanistic<00:03:22.159> qualities<00:03:22.790> you<00:03:23.420> know

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
kind of humanistic qualities you know

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.680 
kind of humanistic qualities you know
just<00:03:23.690> the<00:03:24.250> you<00:03:25.250> know<00:03:25.310> the<00:03:25.609> enthusiasm<00:03:26.209> in<00:03:26.599> the

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
just the you know the enthusiasm in the

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.270 
just the you know the enthusiasm in the
respect<00:03:27.079> for<00:03:27.319> you<00:03:27.590> know<00:03:27.709> that<00:03:27.829> the<00:03:27.920> patient

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
respect for you know that the patient

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.580 
respect for you know that the patient
isn't<00:03:28.400> just<00:03:28.700> a<00:03:28.790> patient<00:03:29.180> there<00:03:29.299> a<00:03:29.359> person<00:03:29.870> and

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
isn't just a patient there a person and

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:31.960 
isn't just a patient there a person and
I<00:03:30.650> think<00:03:30.859> that's<00:03:31.010> what<00:03:31.159> makes<00:03:31.340> these<00:03:31.489> students

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
I think that's what makes these students

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.569 
I think that's what makes these students
so<00:03:32.120> special
