00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:08.250
 here firstly remember the address of this 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:19.430
 Site can not go there that is not 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:24.600
 I know there well, and after that this value 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:26.400
 remove hence here forth again in 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.280
 see the same place 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.370

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.450
 important and remove this value from here 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.100
 after this is done the editor 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.020
 registry is not yet closed on at the end 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.659

 this file is in the folder and so with this is clear here 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.440
 Further, it is desirable for you to enter the local one. 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:47.489
 user c drive your name 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.500

 By default, you can quickly enter it 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:03:00.379
 seeing manually do the world too 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:03.030
 and clear the entire contents of the temp folder 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:06.450
 it is safe for your computer and 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.549
 so deleted the next item as follows 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.980
 point we need to go planner 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:13.560
 jobs for this you can go to the panel 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:17.480
 control windows switch view 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:23.090
 badges they are in the administration category 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:25.340
 Task Scheduler select 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.959
 task scheduler library and 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.299
 look carefully at the whole task 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:34.139
 which here have particular you should 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:36.239
 interested in the action tab and task 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:39.900
 which lead again to some file 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:42.090
 which is in appdata local in 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.280
 Here gear system that is here 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.549
 this exe file is run every time 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.799
 logging in and changing our settings 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:52.919
 so start with martin v dot ru 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:58.730
 this task we delete and at the same time 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:04:02.220
 remember where the file is located here 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.280
 this we did after that come back 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:11.099
 to conductor 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:14.030
 sword and in the conductor we go again in 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.030
 same folder 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.660
 here we see systems become impudent file 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.730
 which run in the task can 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.970
 delete the entire folder as systems 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:31.280
 der and at the same time delete the folders that 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.570
 linked to go online search in 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.030
 Internet, they are also likely to you 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:38.180
 will be present in this folder 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:40.300
 appdata local and they also affect 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:44.420
 the appearance of the smotrin at the point ru 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:49.310
 remove the last item as we remember 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:50.830
 remember the site address and file name with 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.620
 using this knowledge 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:58.190
 select computer see see 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.480
 find enter the site address but preferably 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.370
 without any hdcp 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:06.740
 But just for example if there was a smartphone 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:08.660
 class is recorded see smart and and he is looking 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.030
 I can hardly find it because he 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.400
 forever means clean at you he will find 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.040
 will find partitions with that name in 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.600
 In this case, you will press 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.790
 right click to hit and will 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.280
 find value from this side with such 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:25.070
 name and delete using the right 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.590
 with the mouse button and after that click on 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.870
 these quotes repeat this is the site address water 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.160
 and for the file names that were run 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.310
 although on the other hand they run 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:37.430
 no longer have to so we remove them and so 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:39.530
 the most important is over now we need 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.840
 return to the start page in the browser 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:45.460
 unimportant transistors you chrome what 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:47.620
 please him better to start 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:50.240
 label properties 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:53.360
 if you have shortcut properties besides the path 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.400
 to the browser itself is another address 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.460
 some site again no matter what 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:03.290
 And the magician is a whole set of different that we delete it. 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:05.540
 value click apply okay tadam y 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:08.210
 we are now running no smart wings 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:11.720
 dot ru here's another quick way to do it 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:17.660
 In general, just delete the shortcut and there 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:19.460
 create a shortcut and find just browser to 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:24.740
 The label will definitely be clean and no. 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:28.689
 problems with it will not be at our selection with 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:32.779
 chrome volume 1 mozilla its pro even easier 

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:34.459
 ready label clean without these at once here 

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:36.109
 and just in case I recommend at the end 

00:06:34.459 --> 00:06:37.969
 still check computer means for 

00:06:36.109 --> 00:06:40.399
 malware removal such as 

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:44.869
 hitman pro 1 byte 

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:47.329
 Intimate in them this wedge and here I hope you and 

00:06:44.869 --> 00:06:49.279
 get a dance is asked as well 

00:06:47.329 --> 00:06:51.799
 below the video there is a link to the article 

00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:56.739
 where everything is told more clearly than me 

00:06:51.799 --> 00:06:56.739
 I can tell on the go that's all for now
