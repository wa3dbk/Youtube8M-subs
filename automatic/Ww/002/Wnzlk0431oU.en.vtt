what you're going to be doing is as you
follow<00:01:37.860> my<00:01:38.100> path<00:01:38.340> you're<00:01:38.880> basically<00:01:39.420> just

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
follow my path you're basically just

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.569 
follow my path you're basically just
going<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.930> be<00:01:40.049> jumping<00:01:40.500> from<00:01:40.799> those<00:01:41.220> invisible

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
going to be jumping from those invisible

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.149 
going to be jumping from those invisible
cylinder<00:01:42.329> things<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:43.290> kind<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.619> appear<00:01:44.009> and

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
cylinder things that kind of appear and

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.590 
cylinder things that kind of appear and
disappear<00:01:44.189> you're<00:01:45.119> just<00:01:45.270> going<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.479> be

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
disappear you're just going to be

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.600 
disappear you're just going to be
basically<00:01:45.840> jumping<00:01:46.500> on<00:01:46.649> top<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.100> those<00:01:47.280> and

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
basically jumping on top of those and

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.819 
basically jumping on top of those and
following<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.090> path<00:01:48.270> so<00:01:49.079> right<00:01:49.350> here<00:01:49.530> every

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
following the path so right here every

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.080 
following the path so right here every
once<00:01:50.040> in<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.220> while<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.520> map<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:50.850> going<00:01:51.030> to

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
once in a while the map is going to

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.999 
once in a while the map is going to
glitch<00:01:51.299> out<00:01:51.540> but<00:01:52.110> if<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.290> just<00:01:52.439> move<00:01:52.500> around<00:01:52.829> a

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
glitch out but if you just move around a

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.560 
glitch out but if you just move around a
little<00:01:53.100> bit<00:01:53.340> it'll<00:01:53.549> reappear<00:01:54.090> for<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:54.360> and

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
little bit it'll reappear for you and

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.149 
little bit it'll reappear for you and
it's<00:01:54.720> all<00:01:54.869> there<00:01:55.079> even<00:01:55.380> if<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:55.590> can't<00:01:55.829> see<00:01:55.920> it

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
it's all there even if you can't see it

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.969 
it's all there even if you can't see it
it'll<00:01:56.340> still<00:01:56.670> be<00:01:56.790> there<00:01:57.000> so<00:01:57.840> right<00:01:58.140> here<00:01:58.409> now

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
it'll still be there so right here now

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.060 
it'll still be there so right here now
once<00:01:59.850> you<00:01:59.969> get<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.149> this<00:02:00.360> section<00:02:00.689> right<00:02:00.869> here

you're going to make sure that you are
going<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.770> jump<00:02:05.009> on<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.250> left-hand<00:02:05.729> side<00:02:05.850> and

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
going to jump on the left-hand side and

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.900 
going to jump on the left-hand side and
right<00:02:06.869> where<00:02:07.049> I'm<00:02:07.140> pointing<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.740> right<00:02:07.950> now<00:02:08.099> if

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
right where I'm pointing to right now if

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.600 
right where I'm pointing to right now if
you<00:02:09.780> jump<00:02:10.050> on<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.319> right<00:02:10.500> hand<00:02:10.679> side<00:02:10.830> right

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
you jump on the right hand side right

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.550 
you jump on the right hand side right
along<00:02:11.879> this<00:02:12.060> area<00:02:12.510> right<00:02:12.690> here<00:02:12.750> it's

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
along this area right here it's

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.960 
along this area right here it's
you<00:02:13.620> slippery<00:02:14.099> because<00:02:14.400> there's<00:02:14.730> lots<00:02:14.849> of

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
you slippery because there's lots of

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.330 
you slippery because there's lots of
lube<00:02:15.209> I<00:02:15.540> guess<00:02:16.200> crota<00:02:16.530> lubed<00:02:16.860> it<00:02:17.010> up<00:02:17.130> or

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
lube I guess crota lubed it up or

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.800 
lube I guess crota lubed it up or
something<00:02:17.730> because<00:02:17.910> you're<00:02:18.270> just<00:02:18.330> gonna<00:02:18.510> slip

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
something because you're just gonna slip

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.449 
something because you're just gonna slip
right<00:02:18.930> off<00:02:18.989> so<00:02:19.709> you're<00:02:19.830> gonna<00:02:19.920> jump<00:02:20.220> on<00:02:20.310> the

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
right off so you're gonna jump on the

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.280 
right off so you're gonna jump on the
left<00:02:20.700> just<00:02:21.180> like<00:02:21.360> where<00:02:21.660> I<00:02:21.690> was<00:02:21.930> right<00:02:22.110> there

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
left just like where I was right there

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.290 
left just like where I was right there
then<00:02:23.069> you're<00:02:23.280> gonna<00:02:23.370> look<00:02:23.640> up<00:02:23.790> just<00:02:24.060> a<00:02:24.150> little

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
then you're gonna look up just a little

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.510 
then you're gonna look up just a little
bit<00:02:24.450> double<00:02:25.020> jump<00:02:25.260> up<00:02:25.440> make<00:02:25.680> sure<00:02:26.160> you<00:02:26.400> don't

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
bit double jump up make sure you don't

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.670 
bit double jump up make sure you don't
over<00:02:26.700> jump<00:02:27.120> it<00:02:27.300> it's<00:02:27.959> actually<00:02:28.080> a<00:02:28.319> pretty<00:02:28.349> big

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
over jump it it's actually a pretty big

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.170 
over jump it it's actually a pretty big
landing<00:02:29.069> base<00:02:29.310> then<00:02:29.730> you're<00:02:29.880> gonna<00:02:29.970> look

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
landing base then you're gonna look

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.790 
landing base then you're gonna look
right<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.630> just<00:02:30.780> do<00:02:30.870> a<00:02:30.900> single<00:02:31.170> jump<00:02:31.470> up<00:02:31.620> onto

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
right and just do a single jump up onto

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.130 
right and just do a single jump up onto
this<00:02:32.130> rock<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:32.640> then<00:02:33.239> this<00:02:33.480> is<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.660> tricky

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
this rock and then this is the tricky

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.199 
this rock and then this is the tricky
one<00:02:34.319> it's<00:02:34.620> not<00:02:34.739> too<00:02:34.980> tricky<00:02:35.220> but<00:02:35.910> you<00:02:36.060> just

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
one it's not too tricky but you just

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.790 
one it's not too tricky but you just
gotta<00:02:36.390> double<00:02:36.720> jump<00:02:36.900> and<00:02:37.080> land<00:02:37.170> on<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.590> tip<00:02:37.769> of

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
gotta double jump and land on the tip of

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.430 
gotta double jump and land on the tip of
it<00:02:38.069> then<00:02:38.640> you'll<00:02:38.910> be<00:02:38.940> able<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.360> jump<00:02:39.780> up<00:02:39.930> double

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
it then you'll be able to jump up double

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.020 
it then you'll be able to jump up double
dump<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.980> rest<00:02:41.130> of<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.370> way<00:02:41.489> all<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.760> way<00:02:41.880> up

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
dump the rest of the way all the way up

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.420 
dump the rest of the way all the way up
here<00:02:42.269> so<00:02:42.959> once<00:02:43.319> we're<00:02:43.500> up<00:02:43.590> here<00:02:43.769> this<00:02:44.160> is<00:02:44.400> the

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
here so once we're up here this is the

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.030 
here so once we're up here this is the
this<00:02:45.300> is<00:02:45.360> back<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.930> like<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.290> original<00:02:46.799> spawn

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
this is back to like the original spawn

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.070 
this is back to like the original spawn
after<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.610> patch<00:02:47.819> where<00:02:48.060> you<00:02:48.150> double<00:02:48.510> jump<00:02:48.720> or

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
after the patch where you double jump or

after the patch where you double jump or
with<00:02:49.680> any<00:02:49.890> other<00:02:50.100> class<00:02:50.370> you<00:02:50.640> can<00:02:50.760> get<00:02:51.060> up<00:02:51.209> on
