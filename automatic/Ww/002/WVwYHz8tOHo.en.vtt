looks so painful their facial reactions

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.840 
looks so painful their facial reactions
in<00:02:18.630> like<00:02:18.900> that<00:02:19.079> fucking<00:02:19.680> her<00:02:19.859> and<00:02:20.400> I<00:02:20.700> was

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
in like that fucking her and I was

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.370 
in like that fucking her and I was
talking<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.329> guy<00:02:21.480> about<00:02:21.510> it<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:22.109> he<00:02:22.230> was

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
talking to the guy about it and he was

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.960 
talking to the guy about it and he was
he<00:02:22.590> was<00:02:22.709> basically<00:02:22.890> like<00:02:23.310> they're<00:02:23.790> probably

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
he was basically like they're probably

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.660 
he was basically like they're probably
doing<00:02:24.299> it<00:02:24.480> wrong<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:25.079> I<00:02:25.200> think<00:02:25.470> that's<00:02:25.829> most

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
doing it wrong and I think that's most

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.819 
doing it wrong and I think that's most
likely<00:02:26.820> true<00:02:27.329> my<00:02:27.630> eyes<00:02:27.840> watered<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:28.560> that<00:02:28.709> is

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
likely true my eyes watered and that is

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:30.140 
likely true my eyes watered and that is
the<00:02:28.980> reaction<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:29.549> doesn't<00:02:29.850> mean<00:02:29.940> that<00:02:30.030> you're

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
the reaction it doesn't mean that you're

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.870 
the reaction it doesn't mean that you're
crying<00:02:30.420> your<00:02:30.780> eyes<00:02:30.810> do<00:02:31.440> more<00:02:31.739> tough<00:02:32.040> biggest

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
crying your eyes do more tough biggest

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.460 
crying your eyes do more tough biggest
