00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:25.599 
okay go ahead turn the key turn the key

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:30.070 
okay go ahead turn the key turn the key
to<00:00:25.720> on

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:37.640 

alright<00:00:30.740> go<00:00:30.890> ahead<00:00:31.099> try<00:00:31.250> to<00:00:31.340> start<00:00:31.670> it

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:53.780 

I<00:00:37.710> go<00:00:38.460> ahead<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.790> stop<00:00:39.270> it

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:01:06.389 

engage<00:00:54.540> keeps<00:00:54.899> falling

00:01:06.389 --> 00:01:06.399 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:07.980 

looks<00:01:06.850> like<00:01:07.000> the<00:01:07.149> check<00:01:07.390> valve<00:01:07.420> is<00:01:07.840> not

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
looks like the check valve is not

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:20.580 
looks like the check valve is not
holding<00:01:09.840> gays<00:01:10.840> just<00:01:11.110> keeps<00:01:11.350> falling

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.190 

it<00:01:20.920> keeps<00:01:21.160> going<00:01:21.550> down<00:01:21.760> and<00:01:22.090> within<00:01:22.690> five

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
it keeps going down and within five

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:32.820 
it keeps going down and within five
minutes<00:01:23.410> it<00:01:23.650> will<00:01:23.770> be<00:01:23.860> to<00:01:24.040> zero

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:53.000 

you

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.530 

okay<00:01:54.010> the<00:01:54.280> fuel<00:01:54.670> pump<00:01:54.909> has<00:01:55.090> been<00:01:55.120> replaced

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
okay the fuel pump has been replaced

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.180 
okay the fuel pump has been replaced
just<00:01:58.540> plug<00:01:58.840> this<00:01:59.020> in<00:01:59.260> I<00:01:59.470> bled<00:01:59.800> the<00:01:59.920> pressure

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
just plug this in I bled the pressure

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.710 
just plug this in I bled the pressure
down<00:02:02.010> go<00:02:03.010> ahead<00:02:03.040> turn<00:02:03.490> the<00:02:03.700> car<00:02:03.940> to<00:02:04.479> the<00:02:04.570> on

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
down go ahead turn the car to the on

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.219 
down go ahead turn the car to the on
position<00:02:06.030> see<00:02:07.030> pressure<00:02:07.270> comes<00:02:07.630> right<00:02:07.840> up<00:02:07.960> go

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
position see pressure comes right up go

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.690 
position see pressure comes right up go
ahead<00:02:08.350> and<00:02:08.470> try<00:02:08.560> start<00:02:08.890> it<00:02:10.560> start<00:02:11.560> straight<00:02:11.770> up

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.910 

hard<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.090> see<00:02:15.270> there<00:02:15.510> you<00:02:16.020> see<00:02:16.230> clear<00:02:16.530> is<00:02:16.650> about

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
hard to see there you see clear is about

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.900 
hard to see there you see clear is about
to<00:02:17.610> run<00:02:17.760> about<00:02:17.880> 55<00:02:18.510> code<00:02:18.780> rub<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.110> engine<00:02:19.910> from

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
to run about 55 code rub the engine from

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:29.730 
to run about 55 code rub the engine from
you

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.640 

okay<00:02:30.430> and<00:02:30.730> now<00:02:30.930> because<00:02:31.930> the<00:02:32.020> fuel<00:02:32.230> pumps<00:02:32.500> been

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
okay and now because the fuel pumps been

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.650 
okay and now because the fuel pumps been
replaced<00:02:33.040> when<00:02:33.280> we<00:02:33.430> go<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:33.700> turn<00:02:34.000> it<00:02:34.120> off<00:02:34.270> the

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
replaced when we go to turn it off the

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.900 
replaced when we go to turn it off the
pressure<00:02:34.960> should<00:02:35.290> barely<00:02:35.620> drop<00:02:36.040> and<00:02:36.370> start

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
pressure should barely drop and start

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.110 
pressure should barely drop and start
the<00:02:37.030> whole<00:02:37.470> go<00:02:38.470> ahead<00:02:38.680> turn<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.310> turn<00:02:39.850> the<00:02:39.940> car

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
the whole go ahead turn the turn the car

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.090 
the whole go ahead turn the turn the car
off<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:42.310> if<00:02:43.120> we<00:02:43.270> look<00:02:43.530> last<00:02:44.530> time<00:02:44.830> you

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
off and if we look last time you

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.470 
off and if we look last time you
remember<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.720> pressure<00:02:46.720> fell<00:02:47.110> right<00:02:47.320> down

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
remember the pressure fell right down

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.270 
remember the pressure fell right down
this<00:02:49.480> time<00:02:49.750> it's<00:02:49.990> holding<00:02:50.350> right<00:02:50.560> around<00:02:50.740> 50

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
this time it's holding right around 50

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.400 
this time it's holding right around 50
and<00:02:54.270> let's<00:02:55.270> see<00:02:55.420> that<00:02:55.630> needle<00:02:55.900> might<00:02:56.080> move<00:02:56.290> a

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
and let's see that needle might move a

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.900 
and let's see that needle might move a
little<00:02:56.620> bit<00:02:56.800> but<00:02:57.070> doesn't<00:02:57.550> look<00:02:57.670> like<00:02:57.790> it's

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
little bit but doesn't look like it's

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.140 
little bit but doesn't look like it's
moving<00:02:58.030> much<00:02:59.400> it's<00:03:00.400> like<00:03:00.460> the<00:03:00.670> pressures

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
moving much it's like the pressures

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.870 
moving much it's like the pressures
holding<00:03:01.300> a<00:03:01.510> 50<00:03:01.900> and<00:03:02.080> that's<00:03:02.890> because<00:03:03.400> the

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
holding a 50 and that's because the

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.540 
holding a 50 and that's because the
pumps<00:03:04.510> been<00:03:04.660> replaced<00:03:05.080> but<00:03:05.950> more<00:03:06.100> importantly

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
pumps been replaced but more importantly

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.900 
pumps been replaced but more importantly
the<00:03:06.730> check<00:03:06.970> valve<00:03:07.000> that's<00:03:07.360> in<00:03:07.570> the<00:03:07.690> pump<00:03:07.930> is

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
the check valve that's in the pump is

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.550 
the check valve that's in the pump is
keeping<00:03:09.910> the<00:03:10.030> fluid<00:03:10.420> back<00:03:10.900> under<00:03:11.290> pressure

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
keeping the fluid back under pressure

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.230 
keeping the fluid back under pressure
unlike<00:03:12.190> before<00:03:12.310> where<00:03:12.730> it<00:03:12.790> fell<00:03:13.000> right<00:03:13.030> down

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
unlike before where it fell right down

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.280 
unlike before where it fell right down
and<00:03:13.810> we<00:03:14.020> got<00:03:14.200> our<00:03:15.600> failed<00:03:16.600> starts<00:03:17.080> in<00:03:17.230> the

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
and we got our failed starts in the

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:25.660 
and we got our failed starts in the
morning<00:03:17.700> so<00:03:18.700> that<00:03:19.540> is<00:03:19.690> it

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.550 

see<00:03:26.210> still<00:03:26.540> holding<00:03:26.900> it's<00:03:27.110> been<00:03:27.260> a<00:03:27.290> while

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
see still holding it's been a while

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.520 
see still holding it's been a while
still<00:03:28.010> holding<00:03:28.160> pressure<00:03:29.140> around<00:03:30.140> 50

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
still holding pressure around 50

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.220 
still holding pressure around 50
thank<00:03:33.070> you
