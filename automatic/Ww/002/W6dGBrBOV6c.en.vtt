00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
by one by pushing this and then going to

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.719 
by one by pushing this and then going to
your<00:03:23.609> race<00:03:24.019> but<00:03:25.019> that's<00:03:25.290> very<00:03:25.590> slow<00:03:26.040> so

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:26.729 
your race but that's very slow so

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:28.849 
your race but that's very slow so
instead<00:03:27.659> we're<00:03:27.959> going<00:03:28.079> to<00:03:28.139> delete<00:03:28.500> a<00:03:28.530> whole

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
instead we're going to delete a whole

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:31.969 
instead we're going to delete a whole
range<00:03:29.220> of<00:03:29.549> photos<00:03:30.000> from<00:03:30.659> this<00:03:30.959> one<00:03:31.260> to<00:03:31.470> this

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:31.979 
range of photos from this one to this

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:35.649 
range of photos from this one to this
one<00:03:32.180> so<00:03:33.180> you<00:03:33.239> do<00:03:33.659> that<00:03:33.810> by<00:03:33.870> going<00:03:34.229> to<00:03:34.319> menu<00:03:34.470> and

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:35.659 
one so you do that by going to menu and

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:39.020 
one so you do that by going to menu and
you<00:03:36.659> move<00:03:36.870> down<00:03:37.139> to<00:03:37.349> your<00:03:37.500> race<00:03:37.709> and<00:03:38.040> then

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
you move down to your race and then

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.050 
you move down to your race and then
select<00:03:39.479> range<00:03:39.840> if<00:03:40.340> you<00:03:41.340> really<00:03:41.699> want<00:03:41.909> is<00:03:42.030> just

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
select range if you really want is just

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.929 
select range if you really want is just
delete<00:03:42.840> all<00:03:43.049> the<00:03:43.290> images<00:03:43.680> on<00:03:43.979> your<00:03:44.310> SD<00:03:44.489> card

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:44.939

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
then you go to select all images instead

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.780 
then you go to select all images instead
