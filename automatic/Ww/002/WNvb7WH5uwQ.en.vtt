00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.810
 I do this cream and therefore the tone 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.990
 also because I needed it because I had 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.080

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.390

 back to life the girls and extensions 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.740
 so nothing I made the cream is 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:44.340
 this one here and me to make this cream e 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.880
 I was inspired by the thick cream because 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.460
 the video of chio where she said that 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.890
 had this nutritious cream for i 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.840
 hair the rent that is a brand 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.909
 quite famous very very good 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.880
 go and watch lynch said masi but 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.390
 it's not that difficult 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.159
 of all the vegetables it really is simple 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.140
 to do was obviously without My Car 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.909
 because I made a recipe later 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.860
 simple so that you can do it 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.330
 all and simple things and vi 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.900
 like them and even years especially if 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.340
 they work and I'm proud and so this 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.950
 it's the guys cream I'm finding 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.470
 really really well I love it 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.330
 also put it in the evening over by day 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.950
 maybe even every day does it all 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.230
 on the tips but also on the lengths 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.180
 however a very very light cream 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.709
 non-greasy so do not get fat 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.510
 you can use even if you don't have 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.750
 dry hair quietly not 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.209
 dirty does not contain so much fat 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.099
 contains more own vegetable ransoms 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.489
 as the rent those the particularity 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:45.950
 that quenches nourishes given hair without a 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:49.130
 panniers so when I tried to do is 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.290
 really beautiful feeds them a quarry in a 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.560
 turned off or polished even by some 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.209
 shape and take away the christ is really 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.120
 beautiful but I love it too 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.709
 use it in the evening maybe the night before 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.810
 go to sleep then in the morning I 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.900
 awake because the hair is anyway 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:09.140
 more nourished etc. so this is the 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.859
 cream I hope you like it and follow 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.980
 the tutorial 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:11.980
 Hello 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:29.230
 and so then these are not all 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.670
 dispensable ingredients and not there 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.799
 worry the recipe is very simple 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.569
 almost all the ingredients are 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.109
 available at the supermarket 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.999
 let's start immediately preparing luxurious 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:41.829
 the rent is made just by impulses and 

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:43.629
 plant extracts then the net after 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:46.780
 what you had at home you will do 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:47.980
 waiting with the real betis and that but 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.250
 vegetable waste 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.989
 I put rosemary laurel which I am 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.989
 all admits that they shine a lot 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.969
 hair a very good effect a lot 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.590
 nourishing on the hair together with 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:02.319
 infamous the linen film that 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.359
 you will know very well all of them with us 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:05.859
 let's make it to flaxseed gel 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:07.989
 in fact a soul to make its own 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:10.030
 flaxseed gel boosted by 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:12.849
 nutritional principles of these herbs 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.439
 vegetables to blame the amount of 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:16.539
 water higher than what the 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:18.849
 final diffused connector because much 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:19.299
 water evaporates so I was about 200 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:21.310
 grams 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.289
 I put all my herbs on it 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.710
 chosen you choose between these that you 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:29.320
 I also selected others in other words 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.449
 filter and at the infusion I replace it with one but 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.130
 in pot and pour it in and seeds in and 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:36.460
 I do the flaxseed gel 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.050
 with the basis of the infusion precisely you can 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.349
 also watch the video I leave you in 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.270
 overlay to repeat in short 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:44.979
 as is done with the gel of yes viewfinder but 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.979
 however it is very simple 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:49.659
 aside I put soy lecithin with 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:52.150
 ingredient that you also find al 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:53.650
 supermarket that very much 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.070
 hair restoration and it is 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:59.080
 also present in the original trust there 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:02.080
 then I also put macadamia on this 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.970
 present warmed a few seconds in the 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:08.469
 microwaves I made it just type 10 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:09.909
 seconds maximum 15 j this to accelerate 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:10.990
 the dissolution process of the 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:13.210
 lecithin in the oil 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.789
 then he helped me with the spoon I am too 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.310
 the perico ritual oil what i have is 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:19.900
 of Mediterranean dew however could 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.270
 also put any vegetable oil 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.190
 also a castor oil and so on 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.229
 apart you have seen that I took of 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.900
 infused clouds I put the glycerin in it 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:32.190
 when they are still warm I unesco them 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:35.139
 then towards the lecithin with the objects 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.280
 inside the infusion and baudo a 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:39.970
 blend with 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.860
 the blender then to enrich again 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.389
 more to the recipe would have been ready 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.310
 one of your own is curing nothing but me 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:47.380
 I want to enrich even more I put it 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:50.770
 yell beautiful apples that I eat a 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:53.970
 what I find excellent is the honey of la 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:56.500

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.540
 I like these products 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:01.180
 very cocoa too, and so on 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:03.070
 and the super-restructuring milan 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:05.919
 polish the hair I put a 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:08.260
 pin also of volumizing panthenol 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:10.570
 nutritious and then I put two grams of 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.610
 Not all of these proteins have been true 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:15.100
 I'm showing you the types of watts 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:16.900
 proteins that I and two are fine 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:19.060
 grams of the ones you want and I chose 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.840
 just the silk then the proteins 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.640
 of silk 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.740
 you can also use foster care 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:26.140
 keratin click on the video in 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:28.180
 pressure to see how to make it 

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:30.729
 liquidate the foster care of Rome 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:33.580
 area and essential oils all those 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:36.130
 suitable for hair size ph already 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.660
 would be good because it comes 5 however for 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.370
 make it a little bit more acidic than fashion 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.080
 that shines closes the hair scales 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:43.630
 I add very few drops of acid 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.340
 lactic lead to 4 and 5 

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:47.860
 obviously you can also add others 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:49.990
 ingredients such as inulin al 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.760
 2 percent dissolved in the hot shelter 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:54.400
 however, the more I will surely 

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:57.669
 even a own smoothing cream if you do 

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.969
