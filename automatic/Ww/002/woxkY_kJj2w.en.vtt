00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
hello guys today I will show you how to

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.930 
hello guys today I will show you how to
build<00:00:03.540> this<00:00:03.980> teleportation<00:00:04.980> spell<00:00:05.430> device<00:00:05.759> I

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
build this teleportation spell device I

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.589 
build this teleportation spell device I
showed<00:00:06.240> yesterday<00:00:06.480> I<00:00:07.820> make<00:00:08.820> a<00:00:08.849> minimized

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
showed yesterday I make a minimized

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.930 
showed yesterday I make a minimized
version<00:00:09.960> of<00:00:10.080> this<00:00:10.260> destroyed<00:00:10.980> the

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
version of this destroyed the

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.660 
version of this destroyed the
unnecessary<00:00:12.179> parts<00:00:12.719> so<00:00:13.530> it<00:00:13.559> will<00:00:13.950> be<00:00:14.160> more

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
unnecessary parts so it will be more

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.890 
unnecessary parts so it will be more
compact<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:16.190> let's<00:00:17.190> start<00:00:17.460> first<00:00:18.330> put<00:00:18.690> our

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
compact and let's start first put our

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.560 
compact and let's start first put our
initial<00:00:19.410> block<00:00:19.670> this<00:00:20.670> is<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:20.910> block<00:00:21.300> where<00:00:21.539> we

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
initial block this is a block where we

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.029 
initial block this is a block where we
will<00:00:21.840> stand<00:00:22.460> then<00:00:23.960> put<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.109> dispenser<00:00:25.590> facing

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
will stand then put the dispenser facing

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.849 
will stand then put the dispenser facing
right<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:26.820> block<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.359> dig<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.230> hole<00:00:28.500> for

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
right to this block and dig a hole for

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.020 
right to this block and dig a hole for
long<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:29.939> 3<00:00:30.269> wide<00:00:30.539> right<00:00:31.439> after<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.669> dispatch

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
long and 3 wide right after the dispatch

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.020 
long and 3 wide right after the dispatch
like<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:34.430> then<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:36.360> will<00:00:36.510> be<00:00:36.690> our<00:00:36.719> input

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
like that then this will be our input

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.610 
like that then this will be our input
this<00:00:39.030> block<00:00:39.329> we<00:00:39.510> need<00:00:39.660> for<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.050> redstone<00:00:40.469> we

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
this block we need for the redstone we

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.180 
this block we need for the redstone we
will<00:00:40.770> put<00:00:41.100> inverter<00:00:41.489> in<00:00:41.700> here<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.860> in<00:00:43.860> this

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
will put inverter in here and in this

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.670 
will put inverter in here and in this
channel<00:00:44.879> will<00:00:45.180> run<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.809> wire<00:00:46.050> 15<00:00:46.920> g's<00:00:47.219> and

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
channel will run the wire 15 g's and

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.510 
channel will run the wire 15 g's and
connect<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.070> clock<00:00:51.860> so<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.280> all

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
connect it to the clock so that is all

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.099 
connect it to the clock so that is all
we<00:00:53.579> need<00:00:54.440> underground<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:56.539> will<00:00:57.539> just<00:00:57.719> put<00:00:57.989> the

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
we need underground I will just put the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.869 
we need underground I will just put the
wiring<00:00:58.760> this<00:00:59.760> dot<00:01:00.059> here<00:01:00.329> i<00:01:01.050> will<00:01:02.039> put<00:01:02.670> the

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
wiring this dot here i will put the

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.700 
wiring this dot here i will put the
button<00:01:03.390> on<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:04.070> and<00:01:05.780> it<00:01:06.780> will<00:01:06.990> send<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.470> power

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
button on it and it will send the power

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.510 
button on it and it will send the power
to<00:01:07.920> this<00:01:08.100> dot<00:01:08.340> which<00:01:08.850> will<00:01:09.950> translate<00:01:10.950> this

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
to this dot which will translate this

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.570 
to this dot which will translate this
signal<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:13.500> block<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.090> torch

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
signal to the block and to the torch

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.670 
signal to the block and to the torch
then<00:01:17.210> this<00:01:18.100> redstone<00:01:19.100> dust<00:01:19.670> will<00:01:20.540> power<00:01:20.840> this

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
then this redstone dust will power this

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.050 
then this redstone dust will power this
block<00:01:22.240> with<00:01:23.240> another<00:01:23.750> torch<00:01:24.110> the<00:01:24.830> torch<00:01:25.100> will

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
block with another torch the torch will

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.350 
block with another torch the torch will
give<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:26.630> power<00:01:26.780> to<00:01:26.930> the<00:01:27.170> teen<00:01:27.410> tease<00:01:27.680> and<00:01:28.360> out

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
give the power to the teen tease and out

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.640 
give the power to the teen tease and out
of<00:01:29.660> this<00:01:29.810> torch<00:01:30.110> we<00:01:30.320> will<00:01:30.500> put<00:01:30.980> another<00:01:31.370> wire

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
of this torch we will put another wire

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.130 
of this torch we will put another wire
here<00:01:33.650> and<00:01:33.830> then<00:01:34.760> start<00:01:35.090> to<00:01:35.420> build<00:01:35.570> our<00:01:35.810> clock

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
here and then start to build our clock

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.350 
here and then start to build our clock
for<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:37.310> delay<00:01:38.290> we<00:01:39.290> need<00:01:39.470> seven<00:01:40.220> pistons<00:01:40.850> on

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
for the delay we need seven pistons on

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:48.190 
for the delay we need seven pistons on
full<00:01:42.200> delay<00:01:43.990> like<00:01:44.990> that<00:01:45.580> it<00:01:46.580> will<00:01:47.060> give<00:01:47.270> us<00:01:47.300> 2.8

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
full delay like that it will give us 2.8

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:56.490 
full delay like that it will give us 2.8
seconds<00:01:48.800> and<00:01:49.660> another<00:01:51.880> 0.2<00:01:52.880> seconds<00:01:54.370> this

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
seconds and another 0.2 seconds this

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.050 
seconds and another 0.2 seconds this
repeater<00:01:57.500> and<00:01:57.740> connect<00:01:58.490> it<00:02:00.130> so<00:02:01.130> i<00:02:01.460> need<00:02:01.790> to<00:02:01.910> put

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
repeater and connect it so i need to put

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
repeater and connect it so i need to put
another<00:02:02.300> year<00:02:02.780> so<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:03.979> redstone<00:02:04.550> dust<00:02:05.080> and

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
another year so the redstone dust and

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.060 
another year so the redstone dust and
connect<00:02:06.470> to<00:02:06.619> this<00:02:06.800> and<00:02:07.070> our<00:02:08.000> clocks<00:02:08.390> are<00:02:08.660> ready

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
connect to this and our clocks are ready

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:15.190 
connect to this and our clocks are ready
let's<00:02:10.070> try<00:02:10.310> it<00:02:10.429> out

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.270 

and<00:02:15.800> here<00:02:16.069> it<00:02:16.190> goes<00:02:17.230> just<00:02:18.230> like<00:02:18.410> us<00:02:18.590> just<00:02:19.160> like

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
and here it goes just like us just like

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.900 
and here it goes just like us just like
we<00:02:19.310> need<00:02:20.170> next<00:02:21.170> I<00:02:21.319> will<00:02:21.440> build<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:22.129> team<00:02:22.580> t

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
we need next I will build the team t

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.059 
we need next I will build the team t
chamber<00:02:25.030> you<00:02:26.030> need<00:02:26.239> just<00:02:26.480> 3<00:02:26.780> tinti<00:02:27.500> but<00:02:27.769> if<00:02:27.950> you

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
chamber you need just 3 tinti but if you

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:33.449 
chamber you need just 3 tinti but if you
want<00:02:28.310> to<00:02:28.430> fly<00:02:28.640> further<00:02:29.769> you<00:02:30.769> can<00:02:31.360> use<00:02:32.360> more<00:02:32.720> T&amp;T

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
want to fly further you can use more T&amp;T

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.720 
want to fly further you can use more T&amp;T
for<00:02:34.459> bigger<00:02:35.090> explosion<00:02:35.680> but<00:02:36.680> note<00:02:37.069> that<00:02:37.340> you

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
for bigger explosion but note that you

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.320 
for bigger explosion but note that you
need<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.510> chunks<00:02:38.870> loaded<00:02:39.290> if<00:02:39.530> you<00:02:39.910> shut<00:02:40.910> so

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
need the chunks loaded if you shut so

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.559 
need the chunks loaded if you shut so
far<00:02:41.569> away<00:02:42.790> probably<00:02:43.790> you<00:02:44.000> can<00:02:44.180> do<00:02:44.330> this<00:02:44.510> with

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
far away probably you can do this with

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.460 
far away probably you can do this with
Optifine<00:02:45.440> rod<00:02:45.680> which<00:02:46.459> can<00:02:46.810> extend<00:02:47.810> the

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
Optifine rod which can extend the

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.259 
Optifine rod which can extend the
distance<00:02:49.310> of<00:02:49.720> chunk<00:02:50.720> rendering<00:02:51.760> but<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:53.120> in

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
distance of chunk rendering but the in

distance of chunk rendering but the in
vanilla<00:02:53.540> minecraft<00:02:53.690> you<00:02:54.290> can<00:02:54.500> shoot<00:02:54.860> only

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
vanilla minecraft you can shoot only

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:00.539 
vanilla minecraft you can shoot only
about<00:02:56.950> 130<00:02:57.950> meters<00:02:58.459> away<00:02:58.910> and<00:02:59.299> for<00:02:59.989> this

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
about 130 meters away and for this

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.699 
about 130 meters away and for this
treaty<00:03:01.549> will<00:03:01.579> be<00:03:01.760> enough<00:03:02.200> but<00:03:03.200> i<00:03:03.260> will<00:03:03.530> build

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
treaty will be enough but i will build

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.550 
treaty will be enough but i will build
