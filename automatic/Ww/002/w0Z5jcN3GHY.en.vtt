00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
doing this I'm gonna figure out ways to

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.850 
doing this I'm gonna figure out ways to
make<00:04:35.820> my<00:04:36.060> videos<00:04:36.390> seem<00:04:36.780> more<00:04:36.960> appealing<00:04:37.320> could

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
make my videos seem more appealing could

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.660 
make my videos seem more appealing could
we'll<00:04:37.980> watch<00:04:38.400> them<00:04:38.760> and<00:04:38.850> probably

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670 
we'll watch them and probably

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.460 
we'll watch them and probably
do<00:04:40.330> all<00:04:40.450> the<00:04:40.600> regular<00:04:40.750> stuff<00:04:41.110> that<00:04:41.260> everybody

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
do all the regular stuff that everybody

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.150 
do all the regular stuff that everybody
else<00:04:41.650> does<00:04:42.040> that<00:04:42.670> I<00:04:42.700> don't<00:04:43.710> and<00:04:44.710> my<00:04:44.860> friends

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
else does that I don't and my friends

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.560 
else does that I don't and my friends
and<00:04:45.310> I<00:04:45.400> start<00:04:45.640> coming<00:04:45.910> in<00:04:46.000> my<00:04:46.060> videos<00:04:46.330> okay

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
and I start coming in my videos okay

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:47.940
