00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:11.080
 fun services is a term that 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.299
 It is commonly used to refer to 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.580
 portions of eroticism that studies or 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:18.580
 the author put in an anime play that 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:21.070
 originally it is not erotic yet the 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.990
 term has been extended to other means and 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.640
 now the term is not exclusive to 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.789
 anime nor is it precisely 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.250
 eroticism fan service in simple words 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:33.400
 is to give the fan what he wants so that 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.170
 this one is satisfied for example if a 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.299
 author is writing a story of 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.909
 fiction and the fans ask him to kill or 

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:41.559
 revive X em character and he does it 

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:44.049
 then the author is giving fun 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.510
 services which is a very practical 

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:48.670
 unworthy that he disapproved until the 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.379
 marrow is a practice that limits 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.320
 artistic vision and the author's will 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:55.299
 not all fans know what is best 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.890
 for a work because not all 

00:00:55.299 --> 00:01:00.309
 people have a critical vision or 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:03.580
 artistic and even then content is to those 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.830
 fans other fans will disagree and 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.049
 therefore you can never satisfy everyone 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.630
 why satisfy the fans is 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:11.890
 ephemeral is useless does not have the least 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.690
 any sense 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.760
 The important thing of a work is to transmit 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.770
 a message and express an idea give him fun 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.479
 service to a fan is like giving chocolate 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.100
 constantly a baby 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.050
 the baby will thank you and you will be 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.810
 satisfied for the moment but eventually 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.360
 he will want more and if you keep giving him 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.640
 chocolate will reach the point where the 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.270
 baby will become spoiled and think that 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.040
 You owe it to yourself to give chocolate 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.650
 it's the same with fun services in 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.960
 analogy if you give fun services you're wrong 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.150
 creating your fans is a bad thing for the 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.399
 work because it 's a nonsense that only 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.560
 gets in front of the artistic vision and 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.570
 It is also bad for the fans 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.420
 because the fan service 2a pendeja one 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.940
 analogy improvement of what I say is my 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.410
 own channel when I just opened my 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.270
 versus section I gave them the opportunity 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.360
 that they give me suggestions to do 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.330
 videos and I told them that if they left them in 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.670
 this video I would take into account that 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.709
 did you ball animals month 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.230
 for me they poured everywhere their 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.520
 suggestions in recent videos in 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.310
 the ancients and even in pnas 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.980
 they used because I hurt them that by giving them 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.140
 fun services and when I say no 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.940
 I can attend all the suggestions and 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.430
 that I do not have time to improve my 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.860
 video editing that you do to me 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.600
 they insult me they say I'm a bum 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.790
 I should invest more time and dedication 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.340
 when you are not even me 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.530
 paying you know I have other things that 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.600
 do like work worry about me 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.310
 health cater to my family and friends 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.890
 masturbate me among other things 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.420
 important also how is it supposed to 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.460
 criticize the series that critics and ni 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.440
 they even give me time to see them 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.340
 if they want an animation studio 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:55.130
 improve the animation of your series 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:59.060
 finance them with money the work does not 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:01.910
 it's free no and if it's true that monet 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.280
 He made my videos but the money did not 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.430
 are you giving me directly what 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.130
 gives google because companies pay him 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.010
 google because I gave them a service 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:16.430
 to companies by letting them use my channel 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:19.140
 to put advertising plus I am a 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.170
 critical my job is to provide anal 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.900
 and contribute to the reception my priority 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.030
 main has never been between having them 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.760
 Of course I like that I entertain you in 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.340
 my videos but entertaining is not the 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.060
 A critic's priority is to inform and 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.790
 educate 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.310
 I make critical television nights 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.950
 so I do not have to improve my 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.920
 video editing what is important is what 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.900
 I live not what they see my first videos 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.510
 they were made with a quality of shit 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.760
 of editing and they still subscribed 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.760
 because they cared what I had to 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.250
 to say today they no longer care what 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.190
 that I have to say no sir 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.530
 instead of commenting on the video I 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.140
 They claim and ask me for more fun service in 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.660
 your place to give them service has been the 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:10.080
 worst mistake I've made on my channel 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.640
 the last straw was this guy that 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.459
 says that I must attend to needs 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.359
 when they are not paying me and I give them 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:20.489
 free material if I wanted to be 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:23.220
 defiant as you say would stop climbing 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.650
 videos did not even bother in 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.080
 comment on the video itself 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.750
 I know he's disappointed that this is 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.540
 my maximum potential when I have given a 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.479
 well-argued criticism people have been 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.310
 superficial return prefer a criticism 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:40.530
 with shinning and stupid transitions of 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.620
 video to one that is well explained from 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:46.169
 argued as my superior critics 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.360
 in the same way people prefer 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.669
 Stupid shows but that look pretty 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.289
 to a series that really has quality 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.320
 for having a script job more 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:57.720
 worked and intelligent so gentlemen 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:01.500
 this is the real harm that the 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:03.750
 fan service and because the author should never 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.889
 listen to the fan and must do so 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.889
 guide your heart
