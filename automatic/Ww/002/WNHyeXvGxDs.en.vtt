00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
was a bit of a strange experience for us

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.230 
was a bit of a strange experience for us
because<00:01:10.200> it's<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.100> completely<00:01:11.729> different<00:01:11.970> vibe

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
because it's a completely different vibe

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.590 
because it's a completely different vibe
to<00:01:12.450> playing<00:01:12.689> in<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.869> 10<00:01:13.220> so<00:01:14.220> it's<00:01:15.180> nice<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.450> come

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
to playing in a 10 so it's nice to come

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.010 
to playing in a 10 so it's nice to come
back<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:15.960> be<00:01:16.049> able<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.290> kind<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.770> do<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.040> in<00:01:17.159> a

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
back and be able to kind of do it in a

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.700 
back and be able to kind of do it in a
situation<00:01:19.020> that's<00:01:19.110> probably<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.439> little<00:01:19.619> bit

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
situation that's probably a little bit

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.130 
situation that's probably a little bit
bad<00:01:19.860> for<00:01:20.100> us<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.700> think<00:01:20.759> we<00:01:21.659> sort<00:01:21.900> of<00:01:21.960> had<00:01:22.110> a
