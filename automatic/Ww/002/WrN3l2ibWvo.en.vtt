 and now we have to work a lot for the technical part a very 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.350
 virtuous 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.050
 then he fears a work 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.249
 full 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:10.819
 then requires requires 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.109
 it requires thinking one has to be very alert votes easily achieving can 

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:16.629
 happen things 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:18.589
 i 

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:22.459
 Despite the great work, it is the first time he played it and I think it is going to 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.709
 turn into a na 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.669
 a slave work of repertoire 

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:30.399
 broun 

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:33.499
 I entered a pub 

00:02:33.499 --> 00:02:38.079
 is the first time he goes to the hole acclaimed by specialists in the 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:42.039
 classical guitar as one of the most important exponents of this 

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:47.139
 genre worldwide is presented at the yagüez theater where he had a 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:50.139
 excellent host 

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:57.929
 bolivar test for the next session 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:03.229
 we are very well very well the casals festival was presented in mayagüez as 

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:06.789
 part of the activities that the committee celebrating the centenary of the 

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:07.599
 school 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.150
 in a coordinated effort by the client advocate's office 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.450
 and the municipality of mayagüez I spent one night the formidable 

00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:17.159
 i have been 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:21.769
 the witness of an excellent fusion of the master barrueco 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:27.169
 so I think that this kind of percent activity is very much needed in the 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:30.089
 university community and in the town of mayagüez 

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:33.089
 because something that brings us and peace does not bring 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:36.869
 ep do everything that is art and especially music 

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:39.529
 he has something special 

00:03:39.529 --> 00:03:45.199
 what helps us reflect and power for a hundred of things to be given from another 

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:48.519
 point of view and is putting it in context 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.939
 percent in the environment that the important suppliers in has to be 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:57.109
 honest cultural events to train a political student not so 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:58.919
 only technical 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:02.519
 extremely important sun that's what the university is only from the 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.099
 college preparation than a well-balanced professional 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:07.369

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:09.589
 if it is very good and cartes 

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:14.269
 excellent and very good in sciences excellent but must have that balance that 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.620
 knowledge before all aspect of life and music is something very essential 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.439
 special 

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:23.490
 that does not strengthen and all spirituality strengthens the meeting with that 

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:28.080
 with a 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:34.229
