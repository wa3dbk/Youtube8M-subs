okay<00:00:00.870> now<00:00:01.110> we've<00:00:01.319> made<00:00:01.469> it<00:00:01.530> to<00:00:01.649> the<00:00:01.859> Silva<00:00:02.280> home

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
okay now we've made it to the Silva home

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.909 
okay now we've made it to the Silva home
which<00:00:02.730> is<00:00:02.760> the<00:00:02.970> final<00:00:03.270> process<00:00:03.690> for<00:00:03.900> the<00:00:03.990> block

00:00:04.909 --> 00:00:04.919 
which is the final process for the block

00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:08.720 
which is the final process for the block
before<00:00:05.100> we<00:00:05.399> for<00:00:05.580> the<00:00:05.669> Babbitt<00:00:06.089> so<00:00:07.430> okay

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
before we for the Babbitt so okay

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.970 
before we for the Babbitt so okay
Wow<00:00:09.540> that<00:00:09.780> what<00:00:09.990> was<00:00:10.200> in<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.410> boring<00:00:10.710> machine

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
Wow that what was in the boring machine

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.060 
Wow that what was in the boring machine
I<00:00:11.130> left<00:00:11.450> 5,000<00:00:12.450> small<00:00:12.780> for<00:00:13.560> the<00:00:13.650> final

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
I left 5,000 small for the final

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.390 
I left 5,000 small for the final
finishing<00:00:14.520> of<00:00:14.790> this<00:00:14.910> honing<00:00:15.240> stones<00:00:15.510> and<00:00:16.400> as

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
finishing of this honing stones and as

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.980 
finishing of this honing stones and as
the<00:00:17.640> machine<00:00:17.910> is<00:00:18.060> set<00:00:18.240> up<00:00:18.330> right<00:00:18.539> now<00:00:18.690> with<00:00:18.750> the

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
the machine is set up right now with the

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.090 
the machine is set up right now with the
block<00:00:19.200> in<00:00:19.410> it<00:00:19.500> I<00:00:19.710> have<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.490> 220<00:00:21.360> grit<00:00:22.100> stones

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
block in it I have the 220 grit stones

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.060 
block in it I have the 220 grit stones
installed<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:24.119> do<00:00:24.270> the<00:00:24.390> final<00:00:24.770> bought<00:00:25.770> because

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
installed to do the final bought because

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.090 
installed to do the final bought because
I'm<00:00:26.220> only<00:00:26.369> removing<00:00:26.730> five<00:00:27.029> thousands<00:00:27.710> so<00:00:28.710> I

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.100 
I'm only removing five thousands so I

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.210 
I'm only removing five thousands so I
picked<00:00:30.029> this<00:00:30.240> particular<00:00:30.720> whole<00:00:31.320> cassette

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.220 
picked this particular whole cassette

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.740 
picked this particular whole cassette
tha<00:00:32.340> that's<00:00:32.520> that's<00:00:32.850> like<00:00:32.910> why<00:00:33.149> do<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.390> you

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
tha that's that's like why do you you

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.479 
tha that's that's like why do you you
know<00:00:33.840> choose<00:00:34.200> this<00:00:34.350> one<00:00:34.560> over<00:00:34.860> any<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.399> the

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
know choose this one over any of the

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.720 
know choose this one over any of the
others<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:37.100> naturally<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.160> have<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.489> switch

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
others and naturally you have to switch

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.940 
others and naturally you have to switch
from<00:00:38.940> hole<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.720> hole<00:00:39.930> because<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.620> don't<00:00:40.800> want

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
from hole to hole because you don't want

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.710 
from hole to hole because you don't want
to<00:00:41.010> do<00:00:41.100> two<00:00:41.309> simultaneous<00:00:42.090> holes<00:00:42.300> because<00:00:42.630> the

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
to do two simultaneous holes because the

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.319 
to do two simultaneous holes because the
heat<00:00:42.899> created<00:00:43.290> from<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.710> stones<00:00:44.059> would<00:00:45.059> throw

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
heat created from the stones would throw

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.299 
heat created from the stones would throw
off<00:00:45.540> the<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.200> final<00:00:46.500> dimension<00:00:46.980> in<00:00:47.160> other

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
off the the final dimension in other

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.590 
off the the final dimension in other
words<00:00:47.460> you'd<00:00:47.579> have<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.820> wait<00:00:48.000> until<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.420> block

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
words you'd have to wait until the block

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.049 
words you'd have to wait until the block
cooled<00:00:48.930> back<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:50.040> the<00:00:50.130> temperature<00:00:50.579> again<00:00:50.730> so

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
cooled back to the temperature again so

00:00:51.059 --> 00:01:27.179 
cooled back to the temperature again so
you<00:00:51.149> check<00:00:51.510> them<00:00:51.660> side<00:00:51.960> by<00:00:51.989> side

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:27.189 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:29.050 

done<00:01:28.189> how<00:01:28.310> do<00:01:28.369> you<00:01:28.460> know<00:01:28.520> when<00:01:28.640> it's<00:01:28.759> done<00:01:28.820> you

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
done how do you know when it's done you

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.569 
done how do you know when it's done you
do<00:01:29.299> it<00:01:29.420> based<00:01:29.630> on<00:01:29.750> time<00:01:30.049> no<00:01:30.890> basically<00:01:31.460> it's

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
do it based on time no basically it's

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:37.090 
do it based on time no basically it's
like<00:01:31.820> there's<00:01:32.000> a<00:01:32.060> setting<00:01:35.680> the<00:01:36.680> machine<00:01:36.799> is

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
like there's a setting the machine is

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.710 
like there's a setting the machine is
calibrated<00:01:37.280> for<00:01:37.790> the<00:01:37.880> most<00:01:38.060> Pat<00:01:38.299> but<00:01:38.509> you<00:01:38.570> have

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
calibrated for the most Pat but you have

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.440 
calibrated for the most Pat but you have
to<00:01:38.899> naturally<00:01:39.590> every<00:01:39.860> set<00:01:40.039> of<00:01:40.070> stones<00:01:40.399> that<00:01:41.240> we

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
to naturally every set of stones that we

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.389 
to naturally every set of stones that we
use<00:01:41.630> is<00:01:41.899> going<00:01:42.049> to<00:01:42.170> be<00:01:42.320> different<00:01:42.770> and<00:01:43.009> also

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
use is going to be different and also

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.990 
use is going to be different and also
the<00:01:43.520> ironn

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
the ironn

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.999 
the ironn
you<00:01:44.509> know<00:01:44.600> that<00:01:44.810> the<00:01:44.990> quality<00:01:45.229> of<00:01:45.500> the<00:01:45.679> ion

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
you know that the quality of the ion

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:47.950 
you know that the quality of the ion
depending<00:01:46.490> if<00:01:47.060> it's<00:01:47.240> going<00:01:47.330> to<00:01:47.390> be<00:01:47.509> hot<00:01:47.750> or<00:01:47.899> a

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
depending if it's going to be hot or a

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.840 
depending if it's going to be hot or a
soft<00:01:48.229> the<00:01:48.500> there's<00:01:48.770> an<00:01:48.920> equation<00:01:49.250> that<00:01:49.549> you

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
soft the there's an equation that you

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.300 
soft the there's an equation that you
can<00:01:50.119> more<00:01:50.360> or<00:01:50.420> less<00:01:50.539> use<00:01:51.500> or<00:01:51.860> a<00:01:51.890> rule<00:01:52.100> of<00:01:52.280> thumb

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
can more or less use or a rule of thumb

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.419 
can more or less use or a rule of thumb
I<00:01:52.460> should<00:01:52.789> say<00:01:53.000> but<00:01:53.960> there's<00:01:54.590> really<00:01:54.770> you<00:01:55.130> know

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:55.429 
I should say but there's really you know

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:56.950 
I should say but there's really you know
even<00:01:55.460> though<00:01:55.789> it's<00:01:55.939> calibrated<00:01:56.390> it<00:01:56.630> doesn't

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
even though it's calibrated it doesn't

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.630 
even though it's calibrated it doesn't
mean<00:01:57.049> anything<00:01:57.439> because<00:01:57.590> you<00:01:58.100> know<00:01:58.190> each<00:01:58.399> walk

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
mean anything because you know each walk

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.780 
mean anything because you know each walk
is<00:01:58.850> different

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.060 

and<00:02:04.300> more<00:02:04.510> or<00:02:04.600> less<00:02:04.630> the<00:02:04.900> best<00:02:05.110> way<00:02:05.680> to<00:02:05.710> check

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
and more or less the best way to check

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.359 
and more or less the best way to check
it<00:02:06.250> is<00:02:06.370> that<00:02:06.670> it's<00:02:06.790> you<00:02:06.880> know<00:02:06.910> is<00:02:07.630> to<00:02:07.840> put<00:02:07.990> the

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
it is that it's you know is to put the

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.160 
it is that it's you know is to put the
mortgage<00:02:09.369> in<00:02:09.580> it<00:02:09.700> and<00:02:09.850> see<00:02:09.970> how<00:02:10.150> far<00:02:10.390> you<00:02:10.450> how

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
mortgage in it and see how far you how

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.270 
mortgage in it and see how far you how
far<00:02:11.410> you've<00:02:11.590> come

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
far you've come

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.900 
far you've come
so<00:02:13.030> in<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.570> thousands<00:02:13.990> of<00:02:14.140> so<00:02:14.350> far<00:02:14.760> now<00:02:15.760> you're

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
so in the thousands of so far now you're

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.120 
so in the thousands of so far now you're
going<00:02:16.090> five<00:02:16.390> get<00:02:17.380> nowhere<00:02:17.680> it's<00:02:17.950> a<00:02:18.010> so

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
going five get nowhere it's a so

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:25.180 
going five get nowhere it's a so
basically<00:02:18.430> there's<00:02:18.760> no<00:02:18.880> rivalry<00:02:19.330> though

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.580 

because<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:25.940> early<00:02:26.600> watts<00:02:26.840> they<00:02:27.110> have<00:02:27.290> more

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
because the early watts they have more

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.580 
because the early watts they have more
may<00:02:29.220> have<00:02:29.400> more<00:02:29.640> nickel<00:02:29.940> in<00:02:30.060> it<00:02:30.260> some<00:02:31.260> may<00:02:31.410> have

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
may have more nickel in it some may have

00:02:31.590 --> 00:03:21.160 
may have more nickel in it some may have
