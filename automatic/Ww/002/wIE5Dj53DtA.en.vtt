a 70 800 million per hour battery and

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:42.660 
a 70 800 million per hour battery and
there<00:00:40.929> but<00:00:41.920> the<00:00:42.010> difference<00:00:42.249> is<00:00:42.339> actually

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
there but the difference is actually

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.419 
there but the difference is actually
this<00:00:43.179> one<00:00:43.359> is<00:00:43.390> only<00:00:43.629> like<00:00:43.899> six<00:00:44.199> dollars<00:00:44.620> price

00:00:45.419 --> 00:00:45.429 
this one is only like six dollars price

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:48.239 
this one is only like six dollars price
difference<00:00:45.879> and<00:00:46.149> the<00:00:46.929> production<00:00:47.589> cost<00:00:47.710> or<00:00:48.039> in

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:48.249 
difference and the production cost or in

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:49.919 
difference and the production cost or in
there<00:00:48.399> in<00:00:48.550> the<00:00:48.699> sale<00:00:49.269> price<00:00:49.539> that<00:00:49.809> they're

there in the sale price that they're

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:51.950 
there in the sale price that they're
selling<00:00:50.229> it<00:00:50.350> to<00:00:50.530> other<00:00:50.769> companies<00:00:51.159> for<00:00:51.639> and

this<00:00:52.960> one<00:00:53.199> has<00:00:53.649> a<00:00:53.979> rockchip<00:00:54.190> dual-core<00:00:54.960> 1366

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
this one has a rockchip dual-core 1366

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.439 
this one has a rockchip dual-core 1366
like<00:00:56.199> the<00:00:56.379> old<00:00:56.559> well-known<00:00:57.219> cortex<00:00:57.850> a9<00:00:58.179> based

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
like the old well-known cortex a9 based

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:01.410 
like the old well-known cortex a9 based
platform<00:00:59.069> running<00:01:00.069> at<00:01:00.159> 1.6<00:01:00.729> gigahertz<00:01:00.999> and

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
platform running at 1.6 gigahertz and

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.679 
platform running at 1.6 gigahertz and
you<00:01:01.929> get<00:01:02.109> decent<00:01:02.589> performance<00:01:03.219> from<00:01:03.370> this<00:01:03.689> so

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:04.689 
you get decent performance from this so

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:06.810 
you get decent performance from this so
the<00:01:05.079> whole<00:01:05.229> thing<00:01:05.259> is<00:01:05.469> actually<00:01:05.770> pretty<00:01:06.520> zippy

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
the whole thing is actually pretty zippy

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.789 
the whole thing is actually pretty zippy
there's<00:01:07.240> like<00:01:07.479> good<00:01:07.930> speeds<00:01:08.259> around<00:01:08.500> all

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:08.799 
there's like good speeds around all

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:13.249 
there's like good speeds around all
around<00:01:09.630> but<00:01:10.630> on<00:01:11.259> this<00:01:11.530> thing<00:01:11.740> it's<00:01:12.039> only<00:01:12.310> like

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
around but on this thing it's only like

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:15.120 
around but on this thing it's only like
manufacturers<00:01:14.259> are<00:01:14.380> actually<00:01:14.649> only<00:01:14.799> saving

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
manufacturers are actually only saving

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:17.289 
like three to five dollars but this one

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:19.380 
like three to five dollars but this one
only<00:01:17.439> has<00:01:17.710> a<00:01:17.740> dual-core<00:01:18.520> 1.2<00:01:19.060> gigahertz

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390

cortex a5 which is a IMAP x 820
processor<00:01:23.259> and<00:01:23.859> this<00:01:24.009> one<00:01:24.159> actually<00:01:24.280> launched

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
processor and this one actually launched

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.160 
processor and this one actually launched
only<00:01:25.030> like<00:01:25.149> two<00:01:25.329> months<00:01:25.479> ago<00:01:25.689> or<00:01:25.960> something

only like two months ago or something

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.870 
only like two months ago or something
but<00:01:26.710> the<00:01:26.799> chips<00:01:27.009> are<00:01:27.100> only<00:01:27.280> like<00:01:27.490> three

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
but the chips are only like three

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.609 
but the chips are only like three
dollars<00:01:28.240> five<00:01:28.630> dollars<00:01:29.079> or<00:01:29.229> whatever<00:01:29.500> the

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
dollars five dollars or whatever the

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:31.800 
dollars five dollars or whatever the
price<00:01:29.770> is<00:01:30.009> but<00:01:30.399> their<00:01:30.549> way<00:01:30.969> cheap<00:01:31.420> and<00:01:31.630> you

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
price is but their way cheap and you

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.149 
price is but their way cheap and you
actually<00:01:31.929> see<00:01:32.500> that<00:01:32.679> because<00:01:33.039> the

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
actually see that because the

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.569 
actually see that because the
performance<00:01:33.700> is<00:01:33.990> really<00:01:34.990> not<00:01:35.259> great<00:01:35.619> as<00:01:35.979> you

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579 
performance is really not great as you

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:39.120 
performance is really not great as you
can<00:01:36.729> see<00:01:36.939> that<00:01:37.380> even<00:01:38.380> the<00:01:38.590> menus<00:01:38.950> are

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
can see that even the menus are

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.249 
can see that even the menus are
struggling<00:01:39.729> to<00:01:39.759> actually<00:01:40.179> keep<00:01:40.390> up<00:01:40.570> like<00:01:41.140> the

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
struggling to actually keep up like the

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:43.289 
struggling to actually keep up like the
animations<00:01:41.740> can't<00:01:41.950> really<00:01:42.159> keep<00:01:42.310> out<00:01:42.490> so<00:01:43.090> if

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
animations can't really keep out so if

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:45.810 
animations can't really keep out so if
you're<00:01:43.420> out<00:01:43.600> for<00:01:43.869> cheap<00:01:44.560> Chinese<00:01:45.009> tablet<00:01:45.460> from

because those are really really cheap
cpu<00:01:58.630> is<00:01:58.719> there<00:01:58.869> are<00:01:58.960> not

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
cpu is there are not

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.690 
cpu is there are not
really<00:01:59.659> made<00:02:00.590> for<00:02:00.860> a<00:02:00.920> mass<00:02:01.159> market<00:02:01.399> or

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
really made for a mass market or

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.980 
really made for a mass market or
something<00:02:02.000> they're<00:02:02.119> basically<00:02:02.420> just<00:02:02.509> selling

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
something they're basically just selling

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.740 
something they're basically just selling
two<00:02:03.079> companies<00:02:03.439> or<00:02:03.560> faking<00:02:03.829> iPads<00:02:04.340> or<00:02:04.460> stuff

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
two companies or faking iPads or stuff

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.389 
two companies or faking iPads or stuff
so<00:02:05.750> our<00:02:06.020> recommendation<00:02:06.140> is<00:02:06.829> at<00:02:07.100> least<00:02:07.250> a

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
so our recommendation is at least a

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.219 
so our recommendation is at least a
rockchip<00:02:07.610> or<00:02:07.939> an<00:02:08.090> allwinner<00:02:08.450> or<00:02:08.690> whatever<00:02:08.989> but

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
rockchip or an allwinner or whatever but

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.949 
rockchip or an allwinner or whatever but
not<00:02:09.560> i'm<00:02:09.830> a<00:02:09.890> x<00:02:10.429> 8<00:02:10.729> 20<00:02:11.060> or<00:02:11.269> other<00:02:11.540> i'm<00:02:11.810> at
