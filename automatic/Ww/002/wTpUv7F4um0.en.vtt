00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:12.309
 Hello, how are you doing on this occasion? 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.410
 I bring you the recipe for a salsa style 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:17.960
 Sonoran is very easy and 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:23.300
 ingredients are this time I'm going 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:27.019
 to use 3 tomatoes or tomatoes 4 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:30.470
 Serrano chiles a little bit of oregano a 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:32.050
 garlic clove a small bundle of 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.020
 coriander 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:38.610
 Salt 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.500
 to your liking and 7 pins 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.890
 I think that in other places they know him 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.950
 like chile piquín is a chile that are 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.040
 some small balls is very spicy but 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.230
 It gives a great flavor to the sauces 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.570
 in sound since it is well known in the 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.660
 chiltepín is good because we start with 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.300
 this recipe 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.030
 good since we have cut the 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.640
 tomatoes in pieces a little smaller 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.470
 to make them sew fast we're going 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.720
 to remove also the little branches 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:13.760
 Serrano chiles we are going to put 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:17.750
 cook in a cacerolita and we're going to 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:22.220
 put the water on them not much water 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:24.350
 because this is fast and good 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.930
 to show good because we already put in 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.300
 the pan to be sewn 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.880
 when the chiles already change color on 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.000
 This squishy tomato we are going to take it out 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.580
 to liquefy nothing else let's bake the 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.100
 tomato with chiles without salt without garlic 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.500
 without anything ok 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.500
 well let's hope that this was a thing 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.579
 tomato is already cooked with chilies 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.579
 now we are going to put it in the blender 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:00.290
 and then we go to virtual 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.130
 and let's go see what we're going to 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.130
 add 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.220
 We will not throw the rest of the IUF 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:13.160
 is where the tomatoes were cooked for 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.960
 if we need it, we already have here in 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.200
 a little reserved let's put a 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.200
 bit 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:28.240
 let's reserve and we will liquefy 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.270
 if they are fixed, a very light color remains 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.600
 but now that is going to be composed 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.600
 little color 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:08.530
 well now let's add the the 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:11.770
 chiles chiles will be to taste and 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:16.540
 you see how hot the 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:18.690
 the sauce I like a lot of picosita 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.970
 so 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:25.540
 I'm going to put bastan 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.540
 Let's see 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:41.720
 We are going out quite my kitchen 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:44.010
 we are also going to add the garlic clove 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:48.739
 let's add 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.739
 a little oregano 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:56.360
 and we are going to add 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.360
 I think with a teaspoon of salt 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.220
 and if it is missing we will rectify it 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:06.470
 last and we see if it's missing ok we're going to 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.470
 take it to liquefy again 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.470
 and 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:38.129
 Now let's add a little bit of 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:41.009
 tin tomato 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:43.000
 it's a bit not all the way as I think 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:47.460
 half 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.460
 we are going to liquefy again 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:55.319
 we already liquefy and this house was already ready 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:05.729
 and finally we are going to add a 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:08.280
 little bit of fresh chopped cilantro like 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:11.250
 with a lot of cilantro 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.639
 you put the amount that 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.639
 want 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:22.490
 and that salsita we did 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:25.490
 in sound for some fried or as 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:28.020
 chips that are not corn chips and 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:31.229
 with lemon 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:34.969
 craving good because it was ready this 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:38.029
 taco sauce for whatever you want 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:40.519
 I hope you liked this sauce that 

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:43.579
 run from what reached you because it is 

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:46.659
 peaks and if more useful until the next 

00:05:43.579 --> 00:05:46.659
 video go there
