00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
got really confused and started to think

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.990

that you know I wasn't playing him

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.249 
that you know I wasn't playing him
enough<00:02:09.209> despite<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.720> fact<00:02:09.899> if<00:02:09.989> he's<00:02:10.080> played

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
enough despite the fact if he's played

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.309 
enough despite the fact if he's played
in<00:02:10.410> 98<00:02:10.920> percent

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
in 98 percent

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:12.630 
in 98 percent
to<00:02:11.409> the<00:02:11.469> games<00:02:11.680> this<00:02:11.890> season<00:02:12.099> but<00:02:12.459> there

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
to the games this season but there

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.399 
to the games this season but there
that's<00:02:12.879> career<00:02:13.239> mode<00:02:13.420> it's<00:02:13.689> riddled<00:02:14.319> with

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:14.409 
that's career mode it's riddled with

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:16.199 
that's career mode it's riddled with
stupid<00:02:14.890> problems<00:02:15.159> like<00:02:15.340> that<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:15.670> that's

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
stupid problems like that and that's

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:17.190 
stupid problems like that and that's
just<00:02:16.420> that<00:02:16.480> but<00:02:16.689> we'll<00:02:16.780> have<00:02:16.870> a<00:02:16.930> look<00:02:17.019> at<00:02:17.139> the

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
match facts and as you can see I think

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.250 
match facts and as you can see I think
my<00:02:18.730> place<00:02:18.969> in<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.239> final<00:02:19.569> is<00:02:19.689> deserved<00:02:20.170> you

I'm<00:02:21.370> impressed<00:02:21.639> as<00:02:22.030> well<00:02:22.150> because<00:02:22.450> Villa<00:02:22.689> were

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
I'm impressed as well because Villa were

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.390 
I'm impressed as well because Villa were
really<00:02:23.260> difficult<00:02:23.709> for<00:02:23.739> me<00:02:23.859> to<00:02:24.040> play<00:02:24.189> when<00:02:24.370> I

really difficult for me to play when I

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.619 
really difficult for me to play when I
went<00:02:24.579> to<00:02:24.609> Villa<00:02:24.819> Park<00:02:24.969> in<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.269> league<00:02:25.450> they

broken his ankle which is terrible news

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.599 
broken his ankle which is terrible news
because<00:02:32.319> of<00:02:32.469> the<00:02:32.590> fact<00:02:32.799> that<00:02:32.829> we<00:02:32.980> lost<00:02:33.129> Coleman

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:33.609 
because of the fact that we lost Coleman

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:35.580 
because of the fact that we lost Coleman
and<00:02:33.849> look<00:02:34.090> at<00:02:34.209> stones<00:02:34.480> here<00:02:34.689> he's<00:02:34.810> like<00:02:34.959> oh<00:02:35.139> man

would strike for us in the 70th minute

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.190 
would strike for us in the 70th minute
as<00:05:25.850> Valencia<00:05:26.420> comes<00:05:26.690> down<00:05:26.840> the<00:05:26.990> right-hand

side and this really really annoyed me

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.970 
side and this really really annoyed me
right<00:05:29.390> the<00:05:29.810> cross<00:05:30.050> I'm<00:05:30.290> fine<00:05:30.500> with<00:05:30.710> the<00:05:30.830> header

was Kabul I think it was quiet I and
Smalling<00:05:47.540> though<00:05:47.720> on<00:05:47.900> the<00:05:47.990> right-hand<00:05:48.350> side

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210 
but the ball comes in and they just

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.060 
but the ball comes in and they just
don't<00:05:50.419> jump<00:05:50.870> like<00:05:51.110> look<00:05:51.410> at<00:05:51.500> this<00:05:51.620> nobody

know<00:05:55.340> like<00:05:55.790> you<00:05:56.300> would<00:05:56.419> expect<00:05:56.840> a<00:05:57.020> defender<00:05:57.590> in

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
know like you would expect a defender in

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.290

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:47.529 
Richards because he can play centre back
or<00:06:46.190> right<00:06:46.400> back<00:06:46.580> and<00:06:46.759> I<00:06:46.819> think<00:06:47.030> that's<00:06:47.210> handy

00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:47.539 
or right back and I think that's handy

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:54.889 
like they're not interested in him which

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:56.140 
like they're not interested in him which
means<00:06:55.099> I'm<00:06:55.220> gonna<00:06:55.310> have<00:06:55.400> to<00:06:55.580> make<00:06:55.789> a<00:06:55.849> cash

00:06:59.290 --> 00:06:59.300 
Forrester from the equation and I think

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.450

00:07:04.749 --> 00:07:04.759 
get more than that far for sir if I

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:07.119 
get more than that far for sir if I
accept<00:07:05.060> Wolfsburg<00:07:05.569> bid<00:07:05.930> anyway<00:07:06.349> you<00:07:06.409> know<00:07:06.650> so

accept Wolfsburg bid anyway you know so

00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:08.890 
accept Wolfsburg bid anyway you know so
it<00:07:07.250> does<00:07:07.430> kind<00:07:07.729> of<00:07:07.849> all<00:07:08.030> equal<00:07:08.419> out<00:07:08.569> and<00:07:08.780> then

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:08.900 
it does kind of all equal out and then

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.749 
it does kind of all equal out and then
Spurs<00:07:09.229> say<00:07:09.560> that<00:07:09.830> they<00:07:10.009> don't<00:07:10.190> want<00:07:10.310> the<00:07:10.580> RA

00:07:10.749 --> 00:07:10.759

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:13.420 
Spurs say that they don't want the RA
and<00:07:10.969> they<00:07:11.300> can't<00:07:11.509> afford<00:07:11.690> to<00:07:11.960> lose<00:07:12.139> Sandro<00:07:12.800> so

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:13.430 
and they can't afford to lose Sandro so

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:14.860 
and they can't afford to lose Sandro so
I<00:07:13.460> think<00:07:13.639> I<00:07:13.849> made<00:07:14.030> a<00:07:14.060> bit<00:07:14.240> of<00:07:14.360> about<00:07:14.539> three

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:14.870 
I think I made a bit of about three

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.930 
I think I made a bit of about three
million<00:07:15.110> for<00:07:15.440> Sandro<00:07:15.860> just<00:07:16.129> just<00:07:16.490> to<00:07:16.610> see<00:07:16.759> if<00:07:16.849> I

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:16.940 
million for Sandro just just to see if I

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.490 
million for Sandro just just to see if I
can<00:07:17.090> get<00:07:17.240> him<00:07:17.330> he's<00:07:17.479> worth<00:07:17.719> like<00:07:18.050> more<00:07:18.289> than

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:18.500 
can get him he's worth like more than

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.070 
can get him he's worth like more than
twice<00:07:18.889> that<00:07:19.219> so<00:07:19.490> if<00:07:20.240> I<00:07:20.419> can't<00:07:20.629> get<00:07:20.810> him<00:07:20.900> for

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:21.080 
twice that so if I can't get him for

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.240 
twice that so if I can't get him for
that<00:07:21.199> I'll<00:07:21.349> just<00:07:21.530> get<00:07:21.650> him<00:07:21.710> on<00:07:21.800> a<00:07:21.860> pre-contract

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.100 
that I'll just get him on a pre-contract
