00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.560
 that was absolutely useless but 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.150
 it's just to show that youtube there 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:12.990
 gives me stuff sometimes and I'm 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:14.610
 very happy whore what is the bye 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.450
 to buy a camera for that purpose 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.369
 2014 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.990
 so this is a question I see again 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.580
 often and as it is a subject that 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.380
 also evolves throughout the year 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.000
 and who for me I really change 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.109
 almost every three months I'm going 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.849
 make a short video quickly 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.800
 but I'm in danger of doing enough 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.029
 often to tell you how it evolves 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.830
 and who finally knows the best 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.120
 choice for now for reference I 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.630
 I'm filming this video with 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.340
 annecy health a goal 50 mm and magic 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.930
 lantern to install on the camera for 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.309
 me the very first price order if 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.350
 you want to start playing video 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.090
 well, it's going to be yours or just 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.309
 because with the release of the hero gopro 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.379
 iv the old editions dargaud cros 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.610
 03 especially are really not 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.989
 expensive and if you want to start to 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.579
 finally shoot little things 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.379
 short films to the con or do the 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.910
 really stuff to train us l 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.680
 camera that must be confronted everywhere 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.000
 finally the coop rousset really not 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.739
 at all a bad decision 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.390
 after obviously we are at a disadvantage 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.229
 is that it's boring to use if 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.799
 you want to change the settings 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.290
 especially 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.880
 this is not a movie camera is what is 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.310
 a little sort of these issues lula your 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.810
 projects did not have anything before that and that's 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.460
 a potting camera is obviously for 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.500
 the action the sport and it is not necessarily 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.939
 because you roll to if you have 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.950
 a little more slot 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.570
 invest I would always advise them 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.830
 the 600d that I currently have while 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.330
 simply there is no secret if 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.619
 many youtuber turn with the 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.580
 camera of calm is that there is 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.290
 a very big advantage 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.909
 already you can keep the same channel 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.530
 for years if you buy some 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.329
 objectives it's even unique outright 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.280
 infinite image quality that you 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.590
 can have in addition just by focusing the 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.960
 super expensive lenses very expensive sometimes 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.189
 very very very very very expensive so here 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.540
 some parts of the world can 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.890
 to buy me a house is not 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.360
 the only advantage obviously the 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.560
 batteries can not very expensive power 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.759
 buy me full to be able to turn 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.619
 a whole day out of your home 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.240
 the same for memory cards both 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.780
 simple little sd cards could 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.939
 put inside 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.770
 and obviously the big advantage the 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.210
 cannon devices and that's something that 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.710
 canada is not planned at the base it's 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.790
 the community that has around because 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.619
 that obviously there is something that 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.479
 is called magic lantern which is a 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.740
 alternative system for galleries that 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.540
 had a lot of enthusiasm 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.069
 in who are great and who adds 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.360
 really worth to the camera for 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.440
 those who do not know lille companion 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.610
 not necessarily what I'm trying to 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.319
 to say it's a bit like people who 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.120
 jailbreak their iphone finally he's going 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.500
 I composed bricks and appliances 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.880
 canada of the coup there are plenty of small 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.380
 con functions like for example 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.150
 be able to volume the audio during 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.800
 we were recording but it's going great distance 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.480
 you can increase the title has some 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.430
 videos increase the quality of encoding 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.709
 that the duck in question could 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.390
 the video hd air could do any 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.500
 what is it absolutely brilliant and obviously 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.730
 it's compatible with a ton 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.930
 of accessories you can put him a 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.150
 such icam to have plans 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.620
 superfluid volume ex new relegated 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.239
 hens to see her like that on 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.830
 the shoulder with a little monitor why 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.810
 not the case no it's really the thing 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.549
 super modulable in terms of 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.019
 software or in terms of battle the 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.340
 level above investment for 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.930
 me it's several thousand euros 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.640
 and that's something I know 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.080
 that when I want to say it full of people 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.310
 who have nerves but it's something that 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.660
 I sincerely think of which I want the 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.790
 to say the same black magic 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.410
 production kaka a lot of people 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.030
 hate this camera for reasons 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.739
 that I find really not very tight 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.900
 it's a camera that for me must 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.799
 get out of the canoe world and you come back 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.340
 in the world of cameras 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.959
 professional 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.640
 you are already starting to turn on 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.590
 hard drives ssd instead of falling on 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.760
 cards and I started you to 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.230
 mount the battery packs 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.600
 professionals are also going on anywhere 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.400
 what other cinema camera and especially you 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.709
 finally start turning into 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.359
 correct and acceptable video formats for 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.640
 the world of cinema have been profitable to 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:24.989
 resolution the katia so I'm not in 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.870
 train to think about which not because 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.840
 I made a video on it so far 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.430
 not but not that it's a camera 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.109
 able to turn in circles that has a 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.609
 incredible format that allows you to 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:37.319
 completely change their image in post 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:38.700
 production since thanks to the raw format 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.959
 you can change the settings of the 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.519
 camera editing 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.660
 so obviously not everything you 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.790
 can help change at least the 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.079
 white balance and iso editing 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.310
 and that's really embarrassing then 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:49.109
 obviously she has some small ones 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.700
 benefits if I remember one by 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:52.139
 example you have to go to the menus 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.519
 to change the settings and you can 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:55.109
 not change the settings by watching 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.819
 your image at the same time people who 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:58.739
 know it in video loves to hate 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.359
 this camera because it's seen as 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.650
 being too easy and too much for 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.329
 beginners but I find it necessary 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.700
 not denigrate stuff when it's good 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:07.200
 stuff for its price and despite the fact 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.150
 that to use it must be full 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.019
 accessories like all cameras 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.579
 by the way that's why 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:13.170
 that you have to go from the canoe world to 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:14.489
 world will win for the final and bah 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.079
 it remains for me the best report 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.549
 that she was if we take one of her 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.160
 main opponents of the moment the 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.500
 panasonic gh1 4 again we stay 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.130
 in cameras called dslr with their 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.720
 disadvantage 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.580
 for example the fact that they have a role 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.590
 initiator the reread chatr c on the 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.880
 most dslr and that's what makes 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.560
 that when you move your camera very 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.729
 quickly like that you have an effect that we 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.259
 says in English or oblique 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.580
 that is, your image by the 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:36.000
 diagonal every time you move 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.500
 quickly 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.090
 this is due to the way in which the sensor 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.530
 the camera takes pictures line by 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.940
 line and so move the camera 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.470
 quickly he did not have time in 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.060
 save the previous image from 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.440
 blow he records from above and that makes 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.580
 a pretty ugly image while the 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.620
 black magic to what they call a 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.760
 global shooter and so every picture is 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.490
 taken in its entirety 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.199
 if you still have more money bravo 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.330
 you enter the world of cameras 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:59.039
 red the world of cameras that dream 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.599
 all the people who are starting to make 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:01.740
 movies and games classified in this 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:05.550
 category people who want to invest 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:07.320
 between 10000 and 100000 euros since the 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.750
 products from red is the stop of 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.610
 kicks the ex red star they stop 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.870
 dragons who is a little bit of the jesus of 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.580
 all the people who make cinema 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.720
 I do not have to talk about it either because 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.710
 if you are looking for a bit on the internet 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.389
 you will find people who say 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.949
 that they know the least my dreams at 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:21.300
 through years it's a stove that 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:23.099
 forged a great reputation 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.970
 to people who make content 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:25.560
 cinematographic 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.690
 because their sensors are just 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.310
 incredible pictures are fabulous 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.320
 records roll quality videos 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.060
 amazing I have a friend of mine who has a 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.800
 red dragon he can turn in six cases 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.110
 so it can outright stabilize a 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.039
 image in sica and take out a movie in 4k 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.840
 without loss of quality 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:41.159
 it's anything like that if you 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.120
 want to watch because it's something 

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:43.680
 something that I do not know very well 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.120
 many people in the red well 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.220
 less video format 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.990
 r3d that come out the reindeer cameras but

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.659
 trick of small lots to win 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:59.970

00:05:57.659 --> 00:06:02.190
 well we start to debate digital 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.990

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.270

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.520
