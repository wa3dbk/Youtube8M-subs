seen the movie yet to the galaxy so

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.660 
seen the movie yet to the galaxy so
that's<00:00:33.930> something<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.469> still<00:00:35.130> need<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.610> do

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
that's something I still need to do

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.520 
that's something I still need to do
probably<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:39.000> don't<00:00:39.600> know<00:00:39.809> when<00:00:40.050> I'm<00:00:40.170> gonna<00:00:40.290> do

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
probably I don't know when I'm gonna do

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.930 
probably I don't know when I'm gonna do
that<00:00:40.680> might<00:00:40.860> not<00:00:41.010> even<00:00:41.040> see<00:00:41.370> before<00:00:41.670> Dragon

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940

Con<00:00:42.090> but<00:00:42.780> I've<00:00:42.870> been<00:00:42.960> working<00:00:43.260> on<00:00:43.350> these

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
Con but I've been working on these

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.940 
Con but I've been working on these
pretty<00:00:45.090> non-stop<00:00:45.690> for<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.350> past<00:00:46.410> week<00:00:47.039> and

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
pretty non-stop for the past week and

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.619 
pretty non-stop for the past week and
this<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.010> what<00:00:50.280> I've<00:00:50.460> come<00:00:50.489> up<00:00:50.700> with<00:00:50.789> now<00:00:51.329> I'm

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
this is what I've come up with now I'm

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.240 
this is what I've come up with now I'm
in<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.989> middle<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.350> painting<00:00:52.770> them<00:00:52.920> right<00:00:53.070> now

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
in the middle of painting them right now

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.819 
in the middle of painting them right now
I<00:00:53.399> just<00:00:53.610> put<00:00:53.820> on<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:54.559> glossy<00:00:55.559> black<00:00:56.059> layer<00:00:57.059> of

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
I just put on a glossy black layer of

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:59.779 
I just put on a glossy black layer of
paint<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:58.980> there<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.190> can<00:00:59.309> see<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.640> the

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
paint on there you can see that the

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.750 
paint on there you can see that the
handles<00:01:00.239> are<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:01.230> little<00:01:01.680> bit<00:01:01.859> duller<00:01:02.100> those

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
handles are a little bit duller those

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.759 
handles are a little bit duller those
are<00:01:02.940> actually<00:01:03.690> just<00:01:03.899> straight<00:01:04.110> plastic<00:01:04.619> bit

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
are actually just straight plastic bit

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.899 
are actually just straight plastic bit
because<00:01:05.309> those<00:01:06.060> parts<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.380> gun<00:01:07.610> are<00:01:08.610> more

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
because those parts of the gun are more

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.120 
because those parts of the gun are more
likely<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.420> move<00:01:10.320> because<00:01:10.650> that's<00:01:10.890> where<00:01:11.040> the

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
likely to move because that's where the

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.130 
likely to move because that's where the
handle<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:11.970> don't<00:01:12.030> want<00:01:12.420> any<00:01:12.630> wrinkles

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
handle is and I don't want any wrinkles

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.810 
handle is and I don't want any wrinkles
to<00:01:13.439> be<00:01:13.490> happening<00:01:14.490> on<00:01:14.610> this<00:01:14.760> gun<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.409> I'll<00:01:16.820> just

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
to be happening on this gun so I'll just

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.630 
to be happening on this gun so I'll just
leave<00:01:17.970> those<00:01:18.210> with<00:01:18.960> plastidip<00:01:19.470> on<00:01:19.680> them<00:01:19.799> no

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
leave those with plastidip on them no

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.120 
leave those with plastidip on them no
paint<00:01:20.880> or<00:01:21.000> anything<00:01:21.350> so<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.380> did<00:01:22.830> put<00:01:22.979> two

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
paint or anything so I did put two

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.100 
paint or anything so I did put two
layers<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.509> glossy<00:01:24.509> black<00:01:24.630> on<00:01:24.869> there<00:01:25.020> and

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
layers of glossy black on there and

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.760 
layers of glossy black on there and
that's<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:26.299> kind<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:28.340> give<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.369> more<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.909> a

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
that's to kind of give it more of a

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.999 
that's to kind of give it more of a
metal<00:01:31.770> look<00:01:32.250> more<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.970> hard<00:01:33.530> material<00:01:34.530> look

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
metal look more of a hard material look

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.359 
metal look more of a hard material look
on<00:01:35.220> there<00:01:36.530> before<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.560> actually<00:01:37.740> start<00:01:38.159> a

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
on there before I actually start a

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.010 
on there before I actually start a
painting<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:39.210> actual<00:01:40.170> colors<00:01:40.560> on<00:01:40.770> there<00:01:41.220> so

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
painting the actual colors on there so

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.420 
painting the actual colors on there so
that's<00:01:43.020> something<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.439> do<00:01:43.500> on<00:01:43.619> all<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.100> my<00:01:44.189> suits

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
that's something I do on all of my suits

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.749 
that's something I do on all of my suits
usually<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:44.820> use<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.600> same<00:01:46.409> colors<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:47.369> like<00:01:47.610> if

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
usually I use the same colors so like if

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.609 
usually I use the same colors so like if
I<00:01:47.820> wanted<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.180> pay<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.810> suit<00:01:48.990> pink<00:01:49.290> then<00:01:49.530> I

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.700 
thing that I did on here you can kind of
see<00:02:02.219> right<00:02:02.610> here<00:02:02.880> but<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.119> added<00:02:04.020> some<00:02:04.259> magnets

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
see right here but I added some magnets

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.380 
see right here but I added some magnets
on<00:02:04.920> these<00:02:05.210> handles

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
on these handles

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.080 
on these handles
so<00:02:06.950> this<00:02:07.950> star-lord<00:02:08.429> costume<00:02:08.849> that<00:02:08.970> I'm

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
so this star-lord costume that I'm

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.300 
so this star-lord costume that I'm
making<00:02:09.360> it's<00:02:09.869> more<00:02:10.050> of<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.229> party<00:02:10.619> star-lord

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
making it's more of a party star-lord

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.130 
making it's more of a party star-lord
so<00:02:11.640> not<00:02:12.030> really<00:02:12.060> very<00:02:12.569> accurate

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
so not really very accurate

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.860 
so not really very accurate
to<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:14.069> movie<00:02:14.430> no<00:02:14.640> jacket<00:02:15.090> no<00:02:15.120> pants<00:02:15.630> we'll

but put these in some sort of sliders
and<00:02:38.490> kind<00:02:38.700> of<00:02:39.530> strap<00:02:40.530> them<00:02:40.739> in<00:02:40.920> there<00:02:41.220> like<00:02:42.150> to

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
and kind of strap them in there like to

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.090 
and kind of strap them in there like to
