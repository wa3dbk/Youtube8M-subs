blender<00:00:47.370> we<00:00:47.520> want<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.760> use<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.879> nutribullet<00:00:48.510> we

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
blender we want to use a nutribullet we

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.639 
blender we want to use a nutribullet we
know<00:00:48.870> it's<00:00:49.020> gonna<00:00:49.219> make<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:51.090> finer<00:00:51.649> mixture

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
know it's gonna make a finer mixture

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.380 
know it's gonna make a finer mixture
than<00:00:52.890> what<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.280> blender<00:00:53.489> will<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.210> recipe

than what the blender will so the recipe

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.600 
than what the blender will so the recipe
is<00:00:54.629> kind<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.930> weird<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.980> doesn't<00:00:56.160> really<00:00:56.340> fit

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610

fond not really chop these to fine we're
basically<00:01:20.729> just<00:01:20.880> going<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.210> use<00:01:21.360> carrots<00:01:21.810> and

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
basically just going to use carrots and

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.109 
basically just going to use carrots and
water<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:23.009> know<00:01:23.189> we're<00:01:23.729> going<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.909> fill<00:01:24.090> this

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
water you know we're going to fill this

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:31.789 
water you know we're going to fill this
water<00:01:24.420> up<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.780> max<00:01:25.020> line<00:01:25.290> here<00:01:28.369> and<00:01:29.369> on<00:01:30.799> now

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
water up to the max line here and on now

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.290 
water up to the max line here and on now
my<00:01:32.009> idea<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.670> to

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.800 

my<00:01:38.300> idea<00:01:38.690> is<00:01:38.750> to<00:01:39.670> blend<00:01:40.670> these<00:01:40.970> and<00:01:41.390> the

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
my idea is to blend these and the

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.560 
my idea is to blend these and the
nutribullet<00:01:42.140> and<00:01:42.560> then<00:01:43.490> kind<00:01:44.000> of<00:01:44.090> strain<00:01:44.360> them

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
nutribullet and then kind of strain them

00:01:44.570 --> 00:02:01.150 
nutribullet and then kind of strain them
and<00:01:44.600> see<00:01:44.840> what<00:01:44.960> happened

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.020 

probably<00:02:02.160> gonna<00:02:02.280> chalk<00:02:02.460> this<00:02:02.610> up<00:02:02.730> a<00:02:02.850> little

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
probably gonna chalk this up a little

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:33.580 
probably gonna chalk this up a little
finer<00:02:03.240> but<00:02:03.480> that's<00:02:03.630> okay

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.710 

okay<00:02:34.590> so<00:02:34.650> here's<00:02:35.130> what<00:02:35.190> we're<00:02:35.400> left<00:02:35.580> with<00:02:35.760> my

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
okay so here's what we're left with my

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.190 
okay so here's what we're left with my
idea<00:02:37.020> was<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.380> strain<00:02:37.709> this<00:02:38.989> but<00:02:39.989> honestly

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
idea was to strain this but honestly

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.610 
idea was to strain this but honestly
it's<00:02:40.890> really<00:02:41.010> not<00:02:41.870> tell<00:02:42.870> you<00:02:42.930> what<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:43.380> pull

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
it's really not tell you what and pull

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.960 
it's really not tell you what and pull
this<00:02:43.709> up<00:02:43.890> here<00:02:46.459> honestly<00:02:47.459> it's<00:02:47.580> really<00:02:47.640> not

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
this up here honestly it's really not

00:02:47.970 --> 00:03:05.720 
this up here honestly it's really not
that<00:02:48.150> bad<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:48.630> way<00:02:48.780> it<00:02:48.900> is<00:03:03.560> and<00:03:04.560> my<00:03:04.860> suspicion

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
that bad the way it is and my suspicion

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.160 
that bad the way it is and my suspicion
is<00:03:05.819> you<00:03:06.000> can<00:03:06.120> pretty<00:03:06.269> much<00:03:06.390> do<00:03:06.660> this<00:03:06.840> with<00:03:07.019> just

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
is you can pretty much do this with just

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.559 
is you can pretty much do this with just
about<00:03:07.319> any<00:03:07.560> vegetable<00:03:08.190> here<00:03:08.400> and<00:03:08.700> you<00:03:09.299> want<00:03:09.480> to

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
about any vegetable here and you want to

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.360 
about any vegetable here and you want to
make<00:03:09.660> some<00:03:09.870> juice<00:03:10.140> you<00:03:10.650> can<00:03:10.680> pretty<00:03:10.980> much<00:03:11.069> do

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
make some juice you can pretty much do

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.220 
make some juice you can pretty much do
this<00:03:11.549> just<00:03:11.880> about<00:03:12.030> any<00:03:12.360> vegetable<00:03:12.930> I<00:03:12.959> believe

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
this just about any vegetable I believe

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.920 
this just about any vegetable I believe
we're<00:03:13.950> using<00:03:14.130> carrots<00:03:14.670> here<00:03:14.970> man<00:03:15.480> carrots

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
we're using carrots here man carrots

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.589 
we're using carrots here man carrots
have<00:03:16.019> a<00:03:16.049> lot<00:03:16.680> of<00:03:16.830> natural<00:03:17.280> sugar<00:03:17.549> in<00:03:17.640> them<00:03:17.940> so

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
have a lot of natural sugar in them so

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.930 
have a lot of natural sugar in them so
it's<00:03:18.690> a<00:03:18.750> pretty<00:03:18.959> easy<00:03:19.230> juice<00:03:19.799> to<00:03:19.980> handle<00:03:20.370> now

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
it's a pretty easy juice to handle now

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.850 
it's a pretty easy juice to handle now
this<00:03:21.090> is<00:03:21.269> you<00:03:21.720> understand<00:03:22.170> we've<00:03:22.590> got<00:03:22.620> some

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
this is you understand we've got some

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.610 
this is you understand we've got some
water<00:03:23.130> in<00:03:23.250> this<00:03:23.549> but<00:03:24.030> this<00:03:24.120> is<00:03:24.299> still<00:03:24.480> pretty

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
water in this but this is still pretty

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.740 
water in this but this is still pretty
concentrated<00:03:25.620> carrot<00:03:26.370> juice<00:03:26.640> so<00:03:27.299> you<00:03:27.330> can<00:03:27.569> add

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
concentrated carrot juice so you can add

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.220 
concentrated carrot juice so you can add
more<00:03:27.780> water<00:03:28.349> this<00:03:28.709> to<00:03:29.040> make<00:03:29.250> it<00:03:29.840> to<00:03:30.840> make<00:03:31.049> it

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
more water this to make it to make it

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.839 
more water this to make it to make it
more<00:03:31.489> you<00:03:32.489> know<00:03:32.519> a<00:03:32.610> little<00:03:32.819> more<00:03:32.970> diluted

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
more you know a little more diluted

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:38.539 
more you know a little more diluted
we're<00:03:35.849> just<00:03:36.000> going<00:03:36.150> to<00:03:36.180> let<00:03:36.359> that<00:03:37.519> strain<00:03:38.519> a

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
we're just going to let that strain a

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:44.930 
we're just going to let that strain a
little<00:03:38.910> bit<00:03:42.920> kind<00:03:43.920> of<00:03:43.980> speed<00:03:44.280> up<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.459> process

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
little bit kind of speed up the process

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.490 
little bit kind of speed up the process
in<00:03:45.090> here<00:03:45.180> a<00:03:45.239> little<00:03:45.359> bit<00:03:45.570> here

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.580 

and<00:03:50.010> this<00:03:50.160> pulp<00:03:53.930> probably<00:03:54.930> pretty<00:03:55.140> good<00:03:55.230> for

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
and this pulp probably pretty good for

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.620 
and this pulp probably pretty good for
like<00:03:55.710> muffins<00:03:56.310> you<00:03:56.820> know<00:03:56.970> what<00:03:57.450> do<00:03:57.510> you<00:03:57.540> think
