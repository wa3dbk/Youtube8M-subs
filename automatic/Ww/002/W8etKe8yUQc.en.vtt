00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
it will stand on both sides since we

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.520 
it will stand on both sides since we
have<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:45.000> rubber<00:00:45.210> coating<00:00:45.510> here<00:00:45.960> on<00:00:46.140> both<00:00:46.500> sides

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
roofers on both sides so the lows will

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.619

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
need on the back and FC enabled so it's

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.539 
need on the back and FC enabled so it's

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
themselves with micro USB or a DCM so

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.399 
themselves with micro USB or a DCM so
you<00:01:38.759> can<00:01:38.939> decide<00:01:39.299> if<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.689> want<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:39.990> faster

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
you can decide if you want it faster

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.200 
you can decide if you want it faster
probably<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:40.979> should<00:01:41.189> use<00:01:41.310> DC<00:01:41.549> but<00:01:41.939> otherwise

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
probably you should use DC but otherwise

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.170 
probably you should use DC but otherwise
mic<00:01:42.810> USB<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.350> also<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.710> good<00:01:43.829> choice<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.369> also

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
mic USB is also a good choice and also

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.899 
mic USB is also a good choice and also
here<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.570> 300<00:01:46.140> millimeter<00:01:46.560> align<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.220> Jack<00:01:47.670> Ian

here a 300 millimeter align a Jack Ian

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.490
