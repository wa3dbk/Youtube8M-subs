that<00:02:07.530> from<00:02:08.069> with<00:02:08.190> our<00:02:08.280> initial<00:02:08.759> teaser<00:02:09.060> that

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
that from with our initial teaser that

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.540 
that from with our initial teaser that
we<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.899> first<00:02:10.080> one<00:02:10.200> we<00:02:10.259> ever<00:02:10.410> saw<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:11.220> there's

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
we the first one we ever saw the there's

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.210 
we the first one we ever saw the there's
been<00:02:11.730> awakened<00:02:12.150> abut<00:02:12.390> put<00:02:12.629> over

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
been awakened abut put over

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.180 
been awakened abut put over
now<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:14.000> the<00:02:14.540> first<00:02:14.750> order<00:02:15.200> and<00:02:15.410> so<00:02:15.860> I<00:02:15.890> think

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
now the the first order and so I think

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.290 
now the the first order and so I think
that<00:02:16.310> what<00:02:16.430> this<00:02:16.520> means<00:02:16.790> is<00:02:17.000> that<00:02:17.030> we're<00:02:17.240> gonna

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
that what this means is that we're gonna

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.080 
that what this means is that we're gonna
really<00:02:17.990> gonna<00:02:18.110> see<00:02:18.350> that<00:02:18.500> trailer<00:02:18.860> I<00:02:19.040> love<00:02:19.520> the

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
really gonna see that trailer I love the

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.310 
really gonna see that trailer I love the
one<00:02:20.270> thing<00:02:20.510> is<00:02:20.630> though<00:02:20.810> I<00:02:21.020> wouldn't<00:02:21.260> be

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
one thing is though I wouldn't be

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.140 
one thing is though I wouldn't be
surprised<00:02:21.710> I<00:02:21.920> don't<00:02:22.160> necessarily<00:02:22.310> know<00:02:22.790> if<00:02:23.030> it

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
surprised I don't necessarily know if it

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.310 
surprised I don't necessarily know if it
means<00:02:23.270> that<00:02:23.510> those<00:02:23.660> two<00:02:23.720> are<00:02:23.900> gonna<00:02:24.050> battle

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
means that those two are gonna battle

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.620 
means that those two are gonna battle
granted<00:02:25.070> they<00:02:25.190> both<00:02:25.400> are<00:02:25.550> in<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.760> forest<00:02:26.000> but

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
granted they both are in the forest but

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.130 
granted they both are in the forest but
that's<00:02:27.050> shot<00:02:27.350> of<00:02:27.590> kylo<00:02:28.010> Ren<00:02:28.310> when<00:02:28.850> you<00:02:29.450> bow<00:02:30.110> a

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
that's shot of kylo Ren when you bow a

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.480 
that's shot of kylo Ren when you bow a
guy<00:02:30.320> is<00:02:30.380> nowhere<00:02:30.560> to<00:02:30.650> be<00:02:30.710> seen<00:02:30.800> in<00:02:31.100> that<00:02:31.130> shot

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
guy is nowhere to be seen in that shot

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.190 
guy is nowhere to be seen in that shot
and<00:02:31.730> then<00:02:32.000> you<00:02:32.120> cut<00:02:32.360> it<00:02:32.390> might<00:02:32.750> just<00:02:32.870> be<00:02:32.930> kind

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
and then you cut it might just be kind

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.600 
and then you cut it might just be kind
of<00:02:33.260> a<00:02:33.320> tease<00:02:33.560> to<00:02:33.590> worry<00:02:33.950> maybe<00:02:34.220> he's<00:02:34.370> got<00:02:34.490> his

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
of a tease to worry maybe he's got his

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:35.800 
of a tease to worry maybe he's got his
lightsaber<00:02:34.880> up<00:02:35.030> against<00:02:35.240> someone<00:02:35.480> else<00:02:35.630> I
