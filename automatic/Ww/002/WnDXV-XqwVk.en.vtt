00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:08.730
 hello furniture patterns system 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.650
 Assistant on the air and with you I'm Kalashnikov 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.179
 protiv festool 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:15.660
 video shot specifically for the site super 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.150
 white furniture and so suggest your 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:23.160
 Attention assistant frame this new 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:27.660
 the product for us is an analogue of analogs 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.849
 the facade festool here in my opinion even 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.250
 more convenient are the possibilities that we will 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.450
 disclose 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:38.360
 I hope to confirm my words in practice 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:42.500
 so what are the features of this product 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:47.219
 he has a height of 20 millimeters width 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:50.399
 each part of the profile is 80 millimeters here 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.010
 means on both sides of the masses clamps 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.309
 pretty comfortable thing installed 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:00.390
 easily and quickly captures how we see 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:04.439
 milling is that good 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.200
 enters the profile that is and gives 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.720
 the necessary rigidity the most important thing is 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.659
 pretty tough design with 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:17.250
 guaranteed angle of 90 degrees 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.689
 which is important that is possible even as 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.630
 gon using ie i already 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.450
 tried but such a product that is in 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.380
 T-slot can be driven 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:30.299
 some movie plywood 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.479
 something to a plywood strip yes and tighten and 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.200
 you will actually have a square that is 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:40.829
 but it's like a side effect naturally 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:43.500
 It means that it was easy with 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:48.170
 ease of fixation ie adjustment 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.170
 Now this whole business here 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:02:00.800
 as we see please some 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:04.490
 difficulty she walks great easy 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.260
 fixed in the right place with this 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.149
 parties 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:12.590
 it seems to me much more convenient 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:15.440
 what's the original here festool which 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.840
 here it is offered to the side this is all 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.030
 Screwdriver to twist in general not very 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.560
 interesting in my opinion that is here with 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.750
 this side, well, plus and rigidity on 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.510
 in fact, it is due to 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:30.190
 that the patient delays further that we 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:33.020
 can get in the end we can get 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.500
 complex construction let you some 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:40.010
 will the stairs do then we can 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:44.720
 pin at any angle with 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:47.740
 clamp assistant can profile 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.740
 additional yes please mean we 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:53.990
 let go we can move all this music 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:58.400
 at any distance that interests us 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:03:00.650
 have any interesting ones 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.010
 sophisticated projects we can 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.470
 get the opportunity to perform that is 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.150
 we can fix here also 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.260
 here 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.150
 drive one profile i.e. it will 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.130
 here it will be products 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.690
 certain angle to your 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.730
 the details 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:20.030
 clearly recorded that is, I think that 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:24.470
 big plus what we get 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:26.800
 in fact, the compasses are about 2 meters 400 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.390
 millimeters 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.090
 radius to that is in diameter there 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.340
 more than four 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.950
 I think that this is also an invaluable thing about 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:43.209
 compasses we talk separately mean 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:49.209
 there are no steps now 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:49.209
 look at more closely 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.640
 what is natural 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.990
 allows you to work normally 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.390
 we will have side effects 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:06.090
 I'm sure I'm here at the pilot plant 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:09.890
 I will show you the rubric 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:13.260
 the same product to cut a loop that is 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:17.130
 some general notions about this pattern 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:19.769
 they already are in fact the same video I 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.790
 I prefer to disclose those opportunities 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.250
 afterwards 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:28.380
 with this product which maybe not 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:29.790
 touched by other people yes and naturally 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.820
 I will gladly give you all this 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:35.250
 show offhand 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:38.330
 some experiments it will 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:43.500
 the finished product is actually serial 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:46.560
 here is the length of these profiles from 200 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.000
 millimeters to 1000 so far marking 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.120
 us nine hundred sixty millimeters 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.800
 as much as possible but we are working on it 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:57.030
 maybe it will be possible to get more 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:05:00.450
 Well, until they promise today at the start 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:02.850
 from 200 millimeters to thousands that is 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:08.160
 Well, with a markup for 1000 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:10.110
 blanks on one plate up to nine hundred 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.800
 sixty millimeters that is pretty 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:16.110
 serious opportunities you get well 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.250
 Naturally about all the nuances that have 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.550
 we will float 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.320
 I will definitely tell 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.810
 enough detail for you 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.440
 could have a clear idea of ​​what it is 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.720
 product 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:32.190
 what opportunities are there and maybe you 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:36.479
 see even much more than me here from 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:40.760
 the fact that I could say thank you 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:40.760
 I hope you were interested for your attention
