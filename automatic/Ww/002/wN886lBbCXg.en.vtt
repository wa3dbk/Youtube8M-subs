00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello to everyone in absolutely wonderful way 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.720
 we got an invite in enough 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.300
 young social network called about 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.800
 . no it's kind of analogue to everyone 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.110
 famous twitter 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.570
 but with its own features so we 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.029
 today let's talk about her and about 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.400
 free from client there is no bot from 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.230
 the creators of tweetbot which today in 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.519
 no idea at all 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.519
 needs have driven 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.530
 Immediately begin with the fact that in order to 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.739
 start using on. no you need 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.870
 pay from 5 to hundreds of bucks it can 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.030
 scare away many because there is the same free 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.400
 twitter and other social networks which are not 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.230
 require a second from the user money 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.210
 option to find someone who bought himself 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.190
 subscription and begging him 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.890
 in white however in this case you 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.660
 be able to follow up to 40 people 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.150
 I do not know how much is a big minus 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.250
 but I personally did more 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.350
 in order to get acquainted with the service and 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.449
 tell you about it paid bases 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.610
 service by the way gives excellent results 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.130
 the lack of advertising and bot in which 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.960
 tweet now just a lot and which 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.430
 get stupid less by us 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.250
 normal living people 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.530
 web no such no yes indeed these 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.030
 the most alive people there are few but 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.110
 enough theory let's move on 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:25.000
 Directly to the client, there is no year 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.400
 those who use twitter there are hardly there 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.650
 can you find something new no year 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.720
 completely identical to tweetbot too 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.750
 registration is also a tape of messages 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.180
 even the same gestures from below are 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.729
 the usual tab of the last 2 for long 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.430
 clicking on them can be configured here 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:45.009
 less personal messages 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.350
 everything is the same as in the usual twitter 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.750
 however, a significant difference from 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.469
 twitter is an increased limit 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:56.439
 characters ascii 256 new message window 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:59.259
 also no different from tweet year those 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:01.899
 same buttons drafts less on hashtags 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:04.630
 and image hosting downloads 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.399
 accessible to the user is not so much their 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.740
 can be viewed in the profile settings 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:11.410
 how to use all this business 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.840
 just like twitter you write 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.060
 the message those who subscribe to you sees 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.490
 him in his tape and maybe even 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.830
 respond if they approve fiercely 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.410
 like the fact that you uttered it quite 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.380
 it is possible that they will want to make a repost 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.870
 analogue retweet and then their subscribers 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.210
 not subscribed and they will see you too 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.069
 the post sounds somewhat complicated but 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.319
 in fact, all just enough to 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.690
 figure it out in a day or two and now 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.330
 the most important question is why is the whole 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.550
 this feeder 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.070
 on if everyone still uses and what 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.990
 more important will be enjoyed 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.030
 free twitter which is crazy 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.280
 how many millions of users are online 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.160
 can find blog posts explaining 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.820
 what they say and. no, this is where you 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.430
 everyone is happy and you can put in there your 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:02.010
 256 character thoughts without fear of being not 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.090
 understood and blah blah blah actually 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.550
 normal user 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.470
 vol. No, I don't need it while I have twitter 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.260
 which hang out all his friends acquaintances 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.300
 and just interesting people on the other 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.400
 hand developer and ideological 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.890
 mastermind invests enough 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.140
 ambitions in his project he wants to 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.030
 the platform has become one which 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.010
 users of various social 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.260
 networks will be free to share 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.080
 content and in which there will be no advertising 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.760
 but these are only plans for the future 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.680
