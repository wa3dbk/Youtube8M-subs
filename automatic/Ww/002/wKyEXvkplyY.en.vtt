00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:12.390
 Oh this video is also in the dps log 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:15.000
 A small society called Fecaname and Wizards 30 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.949
 It's a combination that I can not see. 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.259
 once 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.939
 If I'd like to look back hand car just say the fact that Pekka 8 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:26.640
 Not strong smells 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:33.660
 Becca eight degree mwothae to live 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:38.850
 Well, because the mortar ahjeo take it so much, and defend this land site 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:46.210
 Yes. Eight of them are a little bigger than they are. 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:53.820
 That's the kind of combination that might be, but now here are some powerful wizards 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:53.820
 It's a mix. It 's just that I have to check it out. 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:02.250
 Joggers are easy to defend him somehow mosquitoes rattling quickly become busy 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:07.040
 Uh mortar or what they ahjeo Tower 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:11.640
 The status of the fetus knife there is a catch to first target the cafe before you see a knife 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:15.020
 Just behind you while striking a knife that does not catch the mages first 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:19.680
 Because the mage will melt away 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:24.900
 Actually, I think it's okay. 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:28.500
 If you take a lot of this, the production time will be considerably longer, 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.940
 30 If it is the horse now 300 minutes committee It is longer than the making of the adventure car 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.500
 It does not take 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:37.200
 It took one hour casual car fight before doing two hours before now, before now 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:42.270
 Because it can make a few 10 minutes 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:45.830
 I'm already fairly proportionate in time, but now I'm talking about a towel 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.830
 Just beoryeotjyo it has been destroyed 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.750
 If you look at the exploration again, 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:58.490
 Yes now 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.890
 The Tauner Lee Archer King has a 2 damage rating 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:05.870
 The wizard has a mixture of year-end. 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:09.400
 And I'm still alive. 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.400
 In the same room at 11 o'clock 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:17.440
 The wizard is now a little dealt with . 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:21.940
 Haejugo the momppang wizards rattling behind Millar 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.230
 Buildings are destroyed itjyo is fairly easy to devise one little s nothing better 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.680
 Near the wave 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:31.530
 And now the timing diagram 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:35.310
 Check it out ah ah ofthe King and the walls are broken and rounded the defense to some extent 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:39.030
 Next time, I will be able to come straight to the towel now . 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:43.069
 If the unpacked at the beginning there was nothing that could get stuck in the outskirts 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:49.909
 It's been pretty good. 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:53.030
 And finally there is a second written so now finish doing most of the 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:58.670
 I can see that all the buildings are destroyed, and about 18% 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:00.319
 It's a bit of a sad thing. So the 1 o'clock side is now a resource. 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:06.560
 In my position 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:09.500
 I think it's okay, but for some attackers, 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:13.909
 There are three or cellar write this breaking down 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:18.109
 I was able to take more resources, but now I have 6 resources. 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:19.430
 Because the world is six, now that the world has only half the resources 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:22.969
 That's a little unfortunate. 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:26.379
 However , when the two stars have quite a lot of back dots, 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:26.379
 I think it was okay before.
