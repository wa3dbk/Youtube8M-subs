00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.609
 hello friends before the weekend already 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.890
 handy but we can't let go 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.389
 you without the last this week 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.099
 3d news daily 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.710
 with a selection of fresh news from the world 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:18.029
 hi-tech don't rush to throw out old 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:21.029
 android smartphone picks up dust on 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.980
 far shelf thanks to the sensors project 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.439
 in the foreseeable future he may gain 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.650
 new life and become useful again 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.090
 programs developed by the university 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.430
 carnegie mellon uses a smartphone or 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.380
 camera to track various 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.050
 changes in the environment for example you can 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.390
 ask questions like yes or no to 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.370
 monitor the state of the front door or 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.340
 give a command to count the cars in the parking lot 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.770
 reaction to the responses of the changes is also possible 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.930
 program say let's send sms 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.199
 if your car suddenly disappeared from the field 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.690
 The camera view shows the source is located 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.699
 at the beta stage but the potential for the idea 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.680
 really huge if only progress 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:03.329
 into machine learning systems development 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:06.240
 behind him was augmented reality 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.670
 should be the next step in the future 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.460
 high tech but she's not 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.500
 can take your foot off the ground smart oh 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.840
 sony's eye resembles the ancients 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.990
 hololens monochrome monitors from 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.299
 microsoft looks intriguing but not yet 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.330
 has even approximate release dates 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.850
 from google glass in general everything is complicated bmw too 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.790
 working on the realization of his vision 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.900
 and I have crustaceans to life 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.090
 automakers have teamed up 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.360
 and about the star house design group to 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.570
 create a device for mini owners 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.729
 points less exchange that vision offer 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.009
 A good set of functions on them can be 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.930
 display information from the dashboard 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.450
 car navigator tips and 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.340
 contextual actions like features 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.210
 buy tickets online when looking at 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.409
 poster but the main feature of the gadget is 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.899
 x-ray mode due to which 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.119
 you can see through the car 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.250
 This can come in handy when parking or 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.360
 to watch the inattentive 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.490
 pedestrians 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.680
 however, so far this is just a prototype 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.110
 however, it is this prototype 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.800
 reflects the direction of the development of BMW in 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.810
 augmented reality sphere if 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.850
 express technical language then in 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.490
 future doctors will save people from 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.470
 embedded design defects still on 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.990
 design stage on such 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.000
 exciting and at the same time frightening 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.870
 thoughts suggest the results of the last 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.020
 experiments 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.560
 scientists from the university of sun yatsen in 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.180
 China 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.209
 they managed to modify dna 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.209
 human embryonic clearing it from the gene 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.250
 which causes one of the varieties 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.790
 fatal disease called 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.340
 anemia coolie 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.100
 for this they used the method 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.970
 genetically engineered system based 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:53.130
 chris persie and c9 these experiences have tremendous 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.500
 value for science however not all 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.080
 greeted them favorably so 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.540
 Chairman of the Regenerative Alliance 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.750
 medicine edward van pierre believes that 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.370
 there are fundamental ethical 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.890
 reason not to stop the border for 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.140
 which are human modifications 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.730
 embryos on the other hand further 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.010
 research allows you to work out 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.620
 techniques by which will 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.320
 possible to save people from serious 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.540
 genetic disorders before birth 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.940
 for example here is parkinson's disease or 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.620
 down syndrome however the Chinese themselves 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.959
 scientists have so far suspended 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.700
 research abandoned the use of 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.590
 technology in practice since 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.870
 probability of a successful outcome after 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.799
 such intervention in dna so far 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.950
 look for too little more news 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.850
 3dnews.ru 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.850
 see you friends
