24-pin<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:19.259> four<00:01:20.189> pins<00:01:20.400> down<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:21.350> bit<00:01:22.350> messy<00:01:22.740> in

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
24-pin the four pins down a bit messy in

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.410 
24-pin the four pins down a bit messy in
that<00:01:23.040> one<00:01:23.280> but<00:01:23.700> yeah<00:01:24.479> if<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.470> look<00:01:25.770> as<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.909> huge

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
that one but yeah if you look as a huge

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.880 
that one but yeah if you look as a huge
fan<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:29.750> obstructed<00:01:30.750> by<00:01:30.869> quite<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.170> lot<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:31.799> it

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
fan the obstructed by quite a lot so it

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:39.140 
fan the obstructed by quite a lot so it
might<00:01:32.130> not<00:01:32.369> be<00:01:32.700> very<00:01:34.579> efficient<00:01:36.920> anyway<00:01:38.150> it

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
might not be very efficient anyway it

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.440 
might not be very efficient anyway it
should<00:01:39.390> be<00:01:39.420> alright<00:01:39.689> so<00:01:40.670> then<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.939> put<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.210> hard

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
should be alright so then I put the hard

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.289 
should be alright so then I put the hard
drive<00:01:42.689> in<00:01:43.399> cut<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.820> when<00:01:44.970> you're<00:01:45.119> doing

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
drive in cut and when you're doing

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.179 
drive in cut and when you're doing
computers<00:01:45.960> it's<00:01:46.140> always<00:01:46.350> important<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.860> use

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
computers it's always important to use

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.389 
computers it's always important to use
one<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.520> these<00:01:47.700> are<00:01:48.799> under<00:01:49.799> static<00:01:50.189> wrist

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
one of these are under static wrist

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.920 
one of these are under static wrist
bands<00:01:50.759> because<00:01:52.579> they<00:01:53.579> stop<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.630> from<00:01:54.780> getting

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
bands because they stop you from getting

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.990 
bands because they stop you from getting
static<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:56.750> destroy<00:01:57.750> computers<00:01:58.729> and<00:01:59.729> very

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
static and destroy computers and very

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.539 
static and destroy computers and very
vulnerable<00:02:00.329> components<00:02:01.229> so<00:02:01.500> always<00:02:02.130> wear<00:02:02.430> one

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
vulnerable components so always wear one

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:03.380 
vulnerable components so always wear one
of<00:02:02.579> those<00:02:02.729> when<00:02:02.909> you're<00:02:03.000> working<00:02:03.119> with
