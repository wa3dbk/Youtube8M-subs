00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
and it doesn't get around to the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.460 
and it doesn't get around to the
amusement<00:00:36.510> parks<00:00:36.720> as<00:00:36.840> often<00:00:37.140> as<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.380> would

well

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.780 
well
different<00:01:17.799> we've<00:01:18.070> got<00:01:18.220> different<00:01:18.370> machines

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
different we've got different machines

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.670 
different we've got different machines
that<00:01:18.940> all<00:01:19.090> make<00:01:19.299> doughnuts<00:01:19.690> different

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
that all make doughnuts different

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.160 
that all make doughnuts different
different<00:01:21.310> sizes<00:01:21.729> of<00:01:21.760> machines<00:01:22.240> so<00:01:22.930> that

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
different sizes of machines so that

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.649 
different sizes of machines so that
output<00:01:23.409> is<00:01:23.950> different<00:01:24.420> right<00:01:25.420> now<00:01:25.540> we're

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
output is different right now we're

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:27.030 
output is different right now we're
running<00:01:25.750> it<00:01:25.990> at<00:01:26.080> our<00:01:26.170> slowest<00:01:26.560> speed<00:01:26.770> possible

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
running it at our slowest speed possible

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.440 
running it at our slowest speed possible
because<00:01:27.580> obviously<00:01:27.729> they<00:01:28.000> don't<00:01:28.090> have<00:01:28.270> a<00:01:28.300> lot

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
because obviously they don't have a lot

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.640 
because obviously they don't have a lot
of<00:01:28.540> people<00:01:28.750> eating<00:01:28.960> and<00:01:29.110> lucky<00:01:29.350> would<00:01:29.470> it<00:01:29.560> it

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
of people eating and lucky would it it

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.320 
of people eating and lucky would it it
means<00:01:29.740> they're<00:01:29.950> part<00:01:30.159> so<00:01:30.970> we're<00:01:31.119> just<00:01:31.150> doing

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
means they're part so we're just doing

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.930 
means they're part so we're just doing
five<00:01:31.570> dozen<00:01:32.159> will<00:01:33.159> they<00:01:33.220> have<00:01:33.369> buckets<00:01:33.729> here<00:01:33.880> I

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
five dozen will they have buckets here I

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.730 
five dozen will they have buckets here I
didn't<00:01:34.270> know<00:01:34.360> I<00:01:34.390> just<00:01:34.780> grabbed<00:01:35.020> a<00:01:35.110> sample<00:01:35.530> one

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
didn't know I just grabbed a sample one

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.499 
didn't know I just grabbed a sample one
but<00:01:36.070> I'm<00:01:36.190> gonna<00:01:36.310> walk<00:01:36.550> away<00:01:36.700> with<00:01:36.790> a<00:01:36.940> bucket<00:01:37.240> so

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
but I'm gonna walk away with a bucket so

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:39.899 
but I'm gonna walk away with a bucket so
we<00:01:38.130> can<00:01:39.130> speed<00:01:39.490> the<00:01:39.550> machine<00:01:39.790> up

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
we can speed the machine up

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:41.249 
we can speed the machine up
substantially<00:01:40.119> we<00:01:40.630> have<00:01:40.720> higher<00:01:40.899> production

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
substantially we have higher production

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:42.570 
substantially we have higher production
machines<00:01:41.680> we<00:01:41.890> have<00:01:41.979> ones<00:01:42.310> that<00:01:42.369> are<00:01:42.490> more

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
machines we have ones that are more

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.580 
machines we have ones that are more
manual<00:01:43.060> we<00:01:43.450> also<00:01:43.600> have<00:01:43.810> a<00:01:43.899> pancake<00:01:44.259> and<00:01:44.350> great

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
manual we also have a pancake and great

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.620 
manual we also have a pancake and great
machine<00:01:44.860> this<00:01:45.520> is<00:01:45.580> this<00:01:46.000> is<00:01:46.149> very<00:01:46.330> interesting

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
machine this is this is very interesting

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.389 
machine this is this is very interesting
let's<00:01:47.020> look<00:01:47.229> at<00:01:47.320> this<00:01:47.470> real<00:01:47.649> quick<00:01:47.830> so<00:01:48.280> it's

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
let's look at this real quick so it's

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:50.130 
let's look at this real quick so it's
actually<00:01:48.610> it's<00:01:48.940> like<00:01:49.090> a<00:01:49.149> conveyor<00:01:49.539> belt<00:01:49.960> and

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
actually it's like a conveyor belt and

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.630 
actually it's like a conveyor belt and
the<00:01:50.229> conveyor<00:01:50.560> belt<00:01:50.860> is<00:01:51.009> actually<00:01:51.429> cooking

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
the conveyor belt is actually cooking

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.040 
the conveyor belt is actually cooking
the<00:01:51.850> pancakes<00:01:52.000> that's<00:01:52.660> correct

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
the pancakes that's correct

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.200 
the pancakes that's correct
well<00:01:53.679> actually<00:01:53.800> the<00:01:54.190> belt<00:01:54.820> does<00:01:55.000> that<00:01:55.119> keep

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
well actually the belt does that keep

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.450 
well actually the belt does that keep
moving<00:01:55.420> over<00:01:55.570> heat<00:01:55.780> plate<00:01:56.020> so<00:01:56.320> technically

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.900 

back<00:02:00.460> that<00:02:00.640> way<00:02:00.899> so<00:02:01.899> okay<00:02:02.800> so<00:02:02.830> and<00:02:03.399> it<00:02:03.580> dumps

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
back that way so okay so and it dumps

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.669 
back that way so okay so and it dumps
out<00:02:04.000> right<00:02:04.270> below<00:02:04.570> where<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.840> batter<00:02:05.050> is<00:02:05.350> I

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
out right below where the batter is I

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:08.040 
out right below where the batter is I
see<00:02:05.890> you<00:02:06.039> there<00:02:06.490> it<00:02:06.580> goes<00:02:06.729> I<00:02:06.910> just<00:02:06.940> don't<00:02:07.300> okay

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
see you there it goes I just don't okay

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.520 
see you there it goes I just don't okay
and<00:02:08.890> here<00:02:09.039> we<00:02:09.100> go<00:02:09.220> it's<00:02:09.429> gonna<00:02:09.519> flip<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.989> do

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
and here we go it's gonna flip and do

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:12.840 
and here we go it's gonna flip and do
over<00:02:11.739> so<00:02:11.920> it's<00:02:12.040> like<00:02:12.130> a<00:02:12.160> perfect<00:02:12.640> pancake

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
over so it's like a perfect pancake

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.580 
over so it's like a perfect pancake
that's<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.540> hardest<00:02:13.900> part<00:02:14.080> about<00:02:14.110> making<00:02:14.350> a

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
that's the hardest part about making a

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.650 
that's the hardest part about making a
pancake<00:02:14.830> is<00:02:15.100> flipping<00:02:15.519> it<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:16.150> machine<00:02:16.480> makes

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
pancake is flipping it the machine makes

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.710 
pancake is flipping it the machine makes
it<00:02:16.780> look<00:02:16.930> simple<00:02:18.150> that<00:02:19.150> is<00:02:19.360> neat

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
it look simple that is neat

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.270 
it look simple that is neat
