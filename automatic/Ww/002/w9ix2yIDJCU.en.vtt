to go in and get the model sketches from

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.320 
to go in and get the model sketches from

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.260 
get displayed this quirk is the reason
why<00:03:41.560> I<00:03:41.590> have<00:03:41.890> two<00:03:42.190> sketches<00:03:42.730> in<00:03:42.910> the<00:03:43.030> part

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
why I have two sketches in the part

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.900 
why I have two sketches in the part
environment<00:03:43.870> I'd<00:03:44.650> rather<00:03:44.950> do<00:03:45.220> that<00:03:45.400> than<00:03:45.460> turn

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
environment I'd rather do that than turn

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.900 
environment I'd rather do that than turn
on<00:03:46.060> each<00:03:46.210> individual<00:03:46.810> sketch<00:03:47.080> in<00:03:47.290> the<00:03:47.380> drawing

on each individual sketch in the drawing

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.430 
on each individual sketch in the drawing
now<00:03:48.910> you<00:03:48.970> can<00:03:49.210> see<00:03:49.360> these<00:03:49.540> geometries<00:03:50.140> are<00:03:50.170> on

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
now you can see these geometries are on

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.770 
now you can see these geometries are on
the<00:03:50.620> sketch<00:03:50.920> geometry<00:03:51.280> layer<00:03:51.790> as<00:03:52.090> opposed<00:03:52.600> to

the sketch geometry layer as opposed to

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.500 
the sketch geometry layer as opposed to
the<00:03:52.930> visible<00:03:53.260> edges<00:03:53.560> layer<00:03:53.770> I<00:03:54.390> turn<00:03:55.390> the

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
the visible edges layer I turn the

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.420 
the visible edges layer I turn the
visible<00:03:55.810> edges<00:03:55.960> layer<00:03:56.320> off<00:03:56.560> so<00:03:57.190> that<00:03:57.220> we

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
visible edges layer off so that we

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.220 
visible edges layer off so that we
didn't<00:03:57.760> get<00:03:57.880> duplicate<00:03:58.420> geometries<00:03:58.960> in<00:03:59.110> the

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
didn't get duplicate geometries in the

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.080 
didn't get duplicate geometries in the
cut<00:03:59.410> file<00:03:59.680> once<00:04:00.010> they<00:04:00.220> are<00:04:00.280> exported<00:04:00.910> to<00:04:00.940> the

cut file once they are exported to the

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:07.470 
cut file once they are exported to the
DWG<00:04:02.520> now<00:04:03.520> you<00:04:03.580> can<00:04:03.820> save<00:04:04.060> this<00:04:04.240> active<00:04:04.690> DWG<00:04:06.480> you

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
DWG now you can save this active DWG you

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.270 
DWG now you can save this active DWG you
could<00:04:07.660> say<00:04:07.840> there's<00:04:08.080> no<00:04:08.200> melted<00:04:08.560> DWG<00:04:09.070> but

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
could say there's no melted DWG but

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.510 
could say there's no melted DWG but
we're<00:04:09.400> going<00:04:09.490> to<00:04:09.610> use<00:04:09.730> an<00:04:09.880> AutoCAD<00:04:10.270> DWG<00:04:11.520> just

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 
we're going to use an AutoCAD DWG just

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.610 
we're going to use an AutoCAD DWG just
to<00:04:12.640> check<00:04:12.850> using<00:04:13.690> the<00:04:13.780> standard<00:04:14.200> export

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
to check using the standard export

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:26.010 
to check using the standard export
options

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.550 

in<00:04:26.380> AutoCAD<00:04:27.569> let's<00:04:28.569> have<00:04:28.780> a<00:04:28.810> look<00:04:28.960> at<00:04:29.110> the<00:04:29.259> cut

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
in AutoCAD let's have a look at the cut

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.710 
in AutoCAD let's have a look at the cut
file<00:04:29.830> and<00:04:30.580> see<00:04:30.789> straight<00:04:31.090> away<00:04:31.270> there's<00:04:31.569> some

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
file and see straight away there's some

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.710 
file and see straight away there's some
problems<00:04:32.110> here<00:04:32.349> with<00:04:32.380> the<00:04:32.710> splines<00:04:33.389> I'm<00:04:34.389> going

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
problems here with the splines I'm going

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.450 
problems here with the splines I'm going
to<00:04:34.840> submit<00:04:35.139> this<00:04:35.289> as<00:04:35.470> a<00:04:35.500> bug<00:04:35.770> to<00:04:35.949> water<00:04:36.130> desk

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
to submit this as a bug to water desk

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.980 
to submit this as a bug to water desk
but<00:04:36.759> I<00:04:36.819> thought<00:04:37.030> I'd<00:04:37.150> leave<00:04:37.300> it<00:04:37.479> in<00:04:37.599> here<00:04:37.810> so

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
but I thought I'd leave it in here so

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.809 
but I thought I'd leave it in here so
you<00:04:38.080> can<00:04:38.139> see<00:04:38.440> that<00:04:38.590> there's<00:04:38.770> an<00:04:38.889> issue<00:04:39.039> be

00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:39.819 
you can see that there's an issue be

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:44.100 
you can see that there's an issue be
aware<00:04:40.090> of<00:04:40.150> it<00:04:40.360> going<00:04:40.630> forwards<00:04:42.419> if<00:04:43.419> we<00:04:43.900> take<00:04:44.050> a

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
aware of it going forwards if we take a

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.659 
aware of it going forwards if we take a
look<00:04:44.289> at<00:04:44.380> this<00:04:44.500> text<00:04:44.800> you<00:04:45.039> can<00:04:45.190> see<00:04:45.400> that<00:04:45.550> is

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
look at this text you can see that is

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:48.629 
look at this text you can see that is
center<00:04:46.419> line<00:04:46.599> text<00:04:47.130> this<00:04:48.130> is<00:04:48.310> one<00:04:48.490> of<00:04:48.520> the

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 
center line text this is one of the

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:50.159 
center line text this is one of the
biggest<00:04:48.849> advantages<00:04:49.090> of<00:04:49.630> using<00:04:50.050> this

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
biggest advantages of using this

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.400 
biggest advantages of using this
technique<00:04:50.620> for<00:04:50.949> generating<00:04:51.370> cut<00:04:51.669> files<00:04:52.410> it's

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
technique for generating cut files it's

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.050 
technique for generating cut files it's
currently<00:04:53.740> multi-line<00:04:54.250> text<00:04:54.550> but<00:04:54.849> we<00:04:54.910> can

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
currently multi-line text but we can

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.820 
currently multi-line text but we can
just<00:04:55.210> explode<00:04:55.690> that<00:04:55.930> out<00:04:56.139> to<00:04:56.380> be<00:04:56.500> a<00:04:56.530> single

well<00:05:03.840> I<00:05:03.870> normally<00:05:04.349> do<00:05:04.500> from<00:05:04.800> here<00:05:04.979> on<00:05:05.160> in<00:05:05.340> is

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
well I normally do from here on in is

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.749 
well I normally do from here on in is
quick<00:05:06.780> select<00:05:07.199> using<00:05:07.560> colors<00:05:08.069> and<00:05:08.310> apply<00:05:08.520> two

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:08.759 
quick select using colors and apply two

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:11.960 
quick select using colors and apply two
layers<00:05:08.910> and<00:05:09.900> then<00:05:10.860> I'll<00:05:11.220> have<00:05:11.460> to<00:05:11.580> go<00:05:11.729> through

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
layers and then I'll have to go through

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.779 
layers and then I'll have to go through
and<00:05:12.330> polyline<00:05:13.289> edit<00:05:13.650> all<00:05:13.889> of<00:05:13.919> this<00:05:14.160> geometry

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:14.789 
and polyline edit all of this geometry

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:16.610 
and polyline edit all of this geometry
so<00:05:15.000> that<00:05:15.030> we<00:05:15.300> end<00:05:15.509> up<00:05:15.630> with<00:05:15.810> closed<00:05:16.050> polylines

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
so that we end up with closed polylines

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.909 
so that we end up with closed polylines
since<00:05:17.160> at<00:05:17.310> the<00:05:17.400> moment<00:05:17.789> unfortunately

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 
since at the moment unfortunately

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:23.569 
since at the moment unfortunately
they're<00:05:19.919> all<00:05:20.099> individual<00:05:20.970> geometries
