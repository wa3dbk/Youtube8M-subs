00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.299
 not pleased your results mail me 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.160
 pleased know this feeling 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.719
 community without family 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.540
 when you get out of some 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.700
 compromise options with your spouse when 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.150
 you come out of some kind of compromise 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.619
 the options between each other is this feeling 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.980
 the unity that you have she present 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:27.330
 directly visible through the screen it's great this 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.970
 that you dropped one as much as 4 a 2 3 3 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.920
 here is a great result 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.559
 of our talk today fiber 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.270
 it is a very valuable product that used to be 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.920
 everyone threw away did not give him 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.020
 of great importance but now everything 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.690
 the world's nutritionists focus on this 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.420
 unique product that helps us 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.180
 and what it helps to do where it contains 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.219
 fiber for what we need it here 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.930
 bran games to digest 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.149
 correctly digested and what is 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.050
 womb of ruby cat food 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:01.020
 Well, the cat's dog will be cut off by the shell 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.940
 grain and you know how much grain shells 5 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.150
 and here each shell contains 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.890
 clot of trace elements and vitamins and from 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.850
 network shell is contained in this 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.400
 small ball 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.400
 it's a bunch of vitamins minerals energy 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.400
 but the interesting thing is that this fiber is not 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.650
 absorbed in the body check it passes 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.930
 transit as a transit search around 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:28.350
 intestine and this fiber is contained 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:32.130
 and in vegetables and in nuts and in porridge hercules 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:35.880
 and in fruit because fiber is a skeleton 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.820
 she keeps her honey comb 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.090
 keeps this apple juice 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.340
 juice of vegetables and it gives you the opportunity 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.340
 receive this juice instantly and this juice 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.290
 gradually enter the body and not 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.009
 there is such a high level of sugar 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.470
 in the blood and the main property of fiber then 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.630
 that it stimulates the intestines food 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.579
 passes very quickly and 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.939
 food does not rot because the intestines 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.729
 man he long it like he does not like 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.979
 on the intestines of a predator predator in a short 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.869
 intestines and meat that he eats 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.880
 predator she does not rot she quickly 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:16.110
 man has intestines up to 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:18.680
 yang and like animals that eat vegetables and 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.810
 greens and so on and in order to 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.160
 adapt this meat meal 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.140
 protein is what we need for this 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.100
 intestine we need fiber which 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.260
 stimulates 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.420
 this intestinal food lump passes 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.880
 fast what else is fiber for 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.970
 perego her digestion is not things you can 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.100
 almost correct for digesting food and that 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.830
 happens our intestines with internal 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.480
 the sides are covered with such a brush border and 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.630
 it is very similar to you know what 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.850
 like a regular brush like that 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.640
 in these villi dwell and the most 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.280
 bifidobacteria which contribute 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.590
 protein assimilation is very important to us 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.130
 protein digestion because protein is what 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.290
 this is our muscle mass mass exactly where 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.750
 hedge our balls yes and it is very important to us 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.820
 how much will this protein and villus digest 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.500
 human intestines who lives in 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.460
 conditions of megapolis with time 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.230
 clogged clogged with a thin layer of mucus 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:16.080
 are clogged so the protein can't go there 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.000
 fall and bacteria cannot break down 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.400
 this protein is bad for amino acids 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.580
 digested and here's the task of the first stage 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.280
 there was further purification of these villi 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.250
 so that food gets well and we are now 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.290
 let's see what happens with food when 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.780
 it falls on such hammered wars 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.930
 not interesting so imagine that 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.090
 this is your intestines and this is not water this 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.550
 your such a substrate 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.950
 and here the squirrels begin to try 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.680
 penetrate through the intestines they 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.180
 gradually penetrate but 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.550
 have seen some of these proteins 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.130
 delayed and only a small part to 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.950
 ticking up the bloodstream they 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.500
 lingered here in this slime which 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.510
 is on the walls of this border here 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.410
 well we take we take some 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:07.620
 brush and calculations we perform what 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:09.959
 cellulose bran and scrub this whole 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.120
 disgusting here because of this intestine here 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:14.400
 so exactly do these bran 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.810
 they are very gently tearing through the villi 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.060
 intestines subtract from it all the filth and 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.910
 clear cleaned out yes after that look 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.760
 we pour as much water but it flows 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.280
 nothing holds ie all protein 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.040
 the substrate enters the villi of the intestines 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.800
 split by bacteria bifidobacteria 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.330
 hired acids are absorbed and absorption 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.400
 protein compared with the first option 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:42.260
 increases many times 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:44.690
 and therein lies the meaning of the first cat 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.550
 by understandable and now we add in 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.100
 protein diet which you will have 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:52.760
 fully digested let's take 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:55.960
 your gorgeous notepads and write 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:59.210
 As a result, fiber is vital for 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:02.419
 each person and should be included in 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:04.370
 diet and those who are trying to lose weight and those 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:06.910
 who does not try other members of ours 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:10.790
 families are mandatory and unconditional 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:14.889
 rules rules for those who lose weight 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.889
 fiber needs everyone
