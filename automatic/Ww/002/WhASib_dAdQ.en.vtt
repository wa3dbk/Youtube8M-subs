00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.890 
onto the foundation apply it onto the
skin<00:06:54.130> so<00:06:54.370> it<00:06:54.880> makes<00:06:55.090> it<00:06:55.240> look<00:06:55.330> a<00:06:55.630> slightly

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:55.900 
skin so it makes it look a slightly

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.110 
skin so it makes it look a slightly
heavier<00:06:56.170> slightly<00:06:56.680> darker<00:06:57.100> bore<00:06:57.340> you<00:06:57.940> can

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:58.120 
heavier slightly darker bore you can

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.760 
heavier slightly darker bore you can
also<00:06:58.270> use<00:06:58.510> as<00:06:58.660> a<00:06:58.720> face<00:06:58.930> powder<00:06:59.140> which<00:06:59.440> is<00:06:59.470> what

00:06:59.760 --> 00:06:59.770 
also use as a face powder which is what

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.040 
also use as a face powder which is what
I've<00:06:59.890> been<00:06:59.920> using<00:07:00.400> then<00:07:01.120> these<00:07:01.600> are<00:07:01.660> really

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:02.050 
I've been using then these are really

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.510 
I've been using then these are really
good<00:07:02.230> for<00:07:02.530> carrying<00:07:02.950> in<00:07:03.010> your<00:07:03.040> bags<00:07:03.280> they<00:07:03.490> are

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520 
good for carrying in your bags they are

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.910 
good for carrying in your bags they are
slightly<00:07:04.030> heavy<00:07:04.570> but<00:07:05.350> I<00:07:05.380> think<00:07:05.560> it's<00:07:05.680> because

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:05.920 
slightly heavy but I think it's because

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.800 
slightly heavy but I think it's because
of<00:07:06.130> the<00:07:06.310> plastic<00:07:07.180> that<00:07:07.810> they<00:07:07.870> have<00:07:08.230> and<00:07:08.620> I<00:07:09.810> have

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:10.810 
of the plastic that they have and I have

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:13.110 
of the plastic that they have and I have
put<00:07:10.930> in<00:07:11.110> shade<00:07:11.710> number<00:07:12.040> zero<00:07:12.370> six<00:07:12.700> and<00:07:12.880> zero

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:13.120 
put in shade number zero six and zero

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.520 
put in shade number zero six and zero
five<00:07:13.360> just<00:07:13.690> because<00:07:13.900> I<00:07:13.990> want<00:07:14.170> to<00:07:14.230> see<00:07:14.320> what<00:07:14.440> the

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:14.530 
five just because I want to see what the

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:16.200 
five just because I want to see what the
difference<00:07:14.890> was<00:07:15.100> there<00:07:15.370> wasn't<00:07:15.550> that<00:07:15.820> much<00:07:16.150> of

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:16.210 
difference was there wasn't that much of

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.300 
difference was there wasn't that much of
a<00:07:16.420> difference<00:07:16.540> but<00:07:17.080> I<00:07:17.350> mean<00:07:17.680> zero<00:07:17.710> six<00:07:18.190> is

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:18.310 
a difference but I mean zero six is

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:20.550 
a difference but I mean zero six is
probably<00:07:18.610> more<00:07:18.820> golden<00:07:19.300> from<00:07:19.570> the<00:07:19.930> zero<00:07:20.230> five

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 
probably more golden from the zero five

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.160 
probably more golden from the zero five
and<00:07:20.950> I<00:07:21.610> do<00:07:21.730> highly<00:07:22.330> recommend<00:07:22.810> this<00:07:22.930> one

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:23.170 
and I do highly recommend this one

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:25.500 
and I do highly recommend this one
because<00:07:23.530> you<00:07:23.920> can<00:07:24.160> wet<00:07:24.790> it<00:07:24.820> and<00:07:25.030> use<00:07:25.180> those<00:07:25.330> of

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:25.510 
because you can wet it and use those of

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:26.940 
because you can wet it and use those of
wet<00:07:25.660> foundation<00:07:26.170> or<00:07:26.290> you<00:07:26.440> can<00:07:26.560> actually<00:07:26.680> use

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:26.950 
wet foundation or you can actually use

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:28.920 
wet foundation or you can actually use
as<00:07:27.100> a<00:07:27.130> mineral<00:07:27.550> powder<00:07:27.760> and<00:07:28.120> it's<00:07:28.300> just<00:07:28.480> on

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:28.930 
as a mineral powder and it's just on

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:30.360 
as a mineral powder and it's just on
those<00:07:29.110> light<00:07:29.470> foundations<00:07:30.100> where<00:07:30.190> you<00:07:30.280> can

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:30.370 
those light foundations where you can

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:31.620

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:43.540 
SPF which is kind of like a letdown but

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:45.840 
SPF which is kind of like a letdown but
as<00:07:43.630> long<00:07:43.780> as<00:07:43.810> you<00:07:43.960> apply<00:07:44.080> the<00:07:44.710> SPF<00:07:45.190> underneath

as long as you apply the SPF underneath

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:47.520 
as long as you apply the SPF underneath
then<00:07:46.090> it<00:07:46.240> should<00:07:46.390> be<00:07:46.420> okay<00:07:46.540> so<00:07:47.140> that<00:07:47.320> is<00:07:47.410> my

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:47.530 
then it should be okay so that is my
