00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:16.460 
there were three changes that were made
one<00:00:13.889> very<00:00:14.429> very<00:00:14.700> minor<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.900> sort<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.320> big

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
one very very minor and to sort of big

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.429 
one very very minor and to sort of big
changes<00:00:16.770> so<00:00:17.190> if<00:00:17.460> you<00:00:17.699> go<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:18.050> create<00:00:19.050> new<00:00:19.199> world

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
changes so if you go to create new world

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.820 
changes so if you go to create new world
and<00:00:19.710> you<00:00:20.220> go<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.400> more<00:00:20.820> world<00:00:21.090> options<00:00:21.830> world

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
and you go to more world options world

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.849 
and you go to more world options world
type<00:00:23.070> you<00:00:23.490> normally<00:00:24.210> just<00:00:24.449> have<00:00:24.720> default<00:00:25.529> and

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
type you normally just have default and

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.769 
type you normally just have default and
super<00:00:26.189> flat<00:00:26.369> but<00:00:26.550> now<00:00:26.640> they<00:00:26.789> have<00:00:26.820> added<00:00:27.150> large

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
super flat but now they have added large

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.980 
super flat but now they have added large
biomes<00:00:28.490> I<00:00:29.490> guess<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.269> biomes<00:00:30.570> are<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.720> lot

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
biomes I guess the biomes are a lot

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.659 
biomes I guess the biomes are a lot
bigger<00:00:31.170> I've<00:00:31.560> seen<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:31.920> lot<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.309> bugs<00:00:32.489> which

you the first kind of air the little bug
i<00:00:43.829> have<00:00:43.980> seen<00:00:45.590> which<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.710> fine<00:00:46.920> because<00:00:47.070> it's

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
i have seen which is fine because it's

just a snapshot it's going to take a

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.580 
just a snapshot it's going to take a
second<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:50.910> kind<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.180> render<00:00:51.480> in<00:00:51.600> here<00:00:51.809> but

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
second to kind of render in here but

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.450 
second to kind of render in here but
when<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.739> fly<00:00:53.160> up<00:00:53.600> you<00:00:54.600> can<00:00:54.899> see<00:00:55.170> tons<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.860> chunks

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
when I fly up you can see tons of chunks

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.920 
when I fly up you can see tons of chunks
just<00:00:56.820> missing<00:00:57.239> it's<00:00:57.449> gonna<00:00:57.600> take<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.750> little

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
just missing it's gonna take a little

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.920 
just missing it's gonna take a little
while<00:00:58.170> again<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.559> render<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.030> very<00:01:00.420> slow

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
while again to render in it is very slow

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.709 
while again to render in it is very slow
i'm<00:01:01.050> not<00:01:01.199> sure<00:01:01.350> if<00:01:01.469> it's<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.649> new<00:01:01.829> code<00:01:02.719> for

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
i'm not sure if it's the new code for

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.679 
i'm not sure if it's the new code for
the<00:01:03.780> large<00:01:03.960> biome<00:01:04.350> or<00:01:04.530> not<00:01:04.650> but<00:01:05.659> come<00:01:06.659> on

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
render in there just chunks taken out

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.899 
render in there just chunks taken out
everywhere<00:01:12.049> which<00:01:13.049> doesn't<00:01:13.500> look<00:01:13.650> normal<00:01:13.909> i

have also heard that there are bigger

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.700 
have also heard that there are bigger
mountains<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:18.450> hills<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.960> are<00:01:19.020> even<00:01:19.350> in<00:01:19.560> the

mountains the hills that are even in the

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.429 
mountains the hills that are even in the
sand<00:01:20.040> areas<00:01:20.909> are<00:01:21.240> bigger<00:01:21.780> they're<00:01:22.140> more

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
sand areas are bigger they're more

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.820 
sand areas are bigger they're more
mountainous<00:01:23.100> not<00:01:23.460> just<00:01:23.729> tiny<00:01:24.240> hills<00:01:24.740> so<00:01:25.740> as

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
looks like and how many blocks it is

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.480 
looks like and how many blocks it is
there<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.290> go<00:01:31.439> there's<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.890> spot<00:01:32.280> right<00:01:32.310> there

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
here new cocoa plants are hanging on the

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.770 
here new cocoa plants are hanging on the
tree<00:02:24.880> so<00:02:25.660> there<00:02:25.810> are<00:02:25.840> three<00:02:26.290> different<00:02:26.740> sizes

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
have seen them on the smaller trees I do

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.510 
have seen them on the smaller trees I do
not<00:02:39.910> see<00:02:40.120> them<00:02:40.210> on<00:02:40.270> the<00:02:40.360> big<00:02:40.390> trees<00:02:40.750> yet<00:02:41.520> where

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
it'll work when I'm in creative no it

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.280 
it'll work when I'm in creative no it
won't<00:02:55.840> it<00:02:56.670> will<00:02:57.670> not<00:02:57.850> when<00:02:58.810> you<00:02:58.900> hit<00:02:59.020> the<00:02:59.110> big

not way past but it's just taking

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.370 
not way past but it's just taking
forever<00:03:42.250> my<00:03:42.970> fraps<00:03:43.239> usually<00:03:43.660> does<00:03:43.810> slowed<00:03:44.110> it
