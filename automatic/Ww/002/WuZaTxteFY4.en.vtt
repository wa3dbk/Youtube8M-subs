00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 video made specifically for psp iso 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.589
 point ru good day 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.480
 the audience between the traditional releases i 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.800
 decided to talk to you about pretty 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.219
 current topic 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.800
 hacking playstation 4 immediately want to notice 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.690
 that I am not a supporter of piracy 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.490
 me even Windows license what 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.740
 talk about not hacked old lady 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.869
 playstation 3 but here follow 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.269
 By developments in this area I am very 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.609
 even love so hearing about that in 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.180
 distant brazil hacked playstation 4 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.190
 I immediately found out what was happening 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.940
 but first a small digression 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.100
 history of hacking the console from sony 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.350
 playstation 1 and playstation 2 were served 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.360
 the so-called mod chip 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.280
 embedded in a specific console 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.780
 the chip that made used 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.600
 imagine thinking what is in them 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.489
 license disk in russia this than 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.039
 could be put in almost any 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.989
 the place where they were sold or on any 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.660
 radio market so what is 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.180
 Licensed games many did not know 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.040
 This method was convenient because the games 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.000
 could be recorded right at home but 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.220
 blanks about which then many did not know and 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.600
 There went these same discs with games 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.490
 buy firmly believes that what we should 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.740
 then we should have slept which 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.170
 almost out of the box was ready 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.920
 play pirated sony games fast 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.710
 realized it 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.500
 it was removed but the hackers were unstoppable 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.360
 at the moment all models are sands so 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.659
 or otherwise easily broken even 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.490
 elementary school need of course 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.299
 don't forget to mention also playstation 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:43.330
 vita legs goes and still not hacked 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.940
 so far there's nothing special to speak nothing 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.710
 with playstation 3 turned out more successfully 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.800
 but long enough 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:54.190
 released in 2006 the console is not 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.110
 succumbed to hackers for as many as four years 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.080
 very, very much for the console 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.240
 but in the end, and hacked to run 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.740
 images of games removable or internal 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.960
 hard drive needed to be put 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.030
 special flash drive a little pohimichit with 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.390
 settings to put the modified 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.280
 flash and play pirated games 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.680
 access to internet services naturally 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.270
 I had to close the truth given 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.410
 the way was quickly covered up with new ones 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.930
 sony firmware 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.730
 but the fact is the console was hacked 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.970
 after that some more appeared 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.850
 ways to run games are not even stitched 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.520
 consoles but that's another story 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.459
 and here we come to today's topic 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.350
 playstation 4 came out almost two years ago 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.230
 and quite often on the Internet come up 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.120
 feykovye rumors and news and breaking her but 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.450
 believable there were quite a few 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.580
 except for information about the fact that in Brazil 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.280
 found the same way to run pirated 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.570
 games from this time has passed a month and 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.209
 now you can absolutely exactly 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.880
 argue that the games are really 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.850
 launch however how does it work and 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.590
 can we call it hacking start with 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.230
 the fact that the following was entered into sony 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.260
 opportunity buying one game in psn 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.000
 it can be activated over 3 consoles then 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.400
 there are for example you and your friends took off and 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.200
 bought one game for three and quietly in 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.590
 play it on your consoles as if 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.330
 bought three copies cool really so here 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.090
 brazilian hackers simply 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.900
 clone consoles using the device 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.400
 which they themselves came up with first 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.670
 buy the game on the main console 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:31.630
 then the second game ends out 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:34.239
 psn after that make a copy call 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.720
 I take it myself with an activated game when 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.340
 device assistance 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.940
 deactivate the playstation network console 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:45.280
 that it can not run the game and 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.950
 then pours on it the above 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.900
 bios all game will work a 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.150
 playstation network won't know that 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.310
 you can do it with infinite 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.900
 number prefixes anyway I 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.280
 I tried to explain it to everyone 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.120
 It was 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:03.420
 understandable but there is no full-value 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.020
 hacking we are not talking about another temporary 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.360
 Lozin to 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.610
 and although you are offered for 100 bucks 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.010
 download as many as five games is better not 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.290
 take a chance on well if you want 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.930
 replace these games with others for you again 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.419
 have to pay up it online judging by 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.459
 sony is already ordered for everything 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.350
 this disgrace and sends angry 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.720
 letters to stores that offer this 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:28.050
 I think this service is coming soon 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.240
 shop will cover again I repeat 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.310
 don't approve piracy but if you 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.160

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.980
