00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.000
 not 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.990
 hello I am jessica los cocos 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.030
 founder of an event agency 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.769
 in Provence and today I'm going to 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.390
 explain how to make pouches 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.609
 to dragees for your wedding table 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.060
 to make your dragee pouches 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:27.039
 you need a small tile 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:31.240
 a beige sheet 90 g scissors a 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:34.690
 pencil a ruler a protractor a little bit of 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.730
 wool a needle and dragees the 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.500
 first step is to draw your 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.930
 pattern on a small tile sheet 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.239
 to facilitate your creation 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.539
 so started drawing your boss 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.879
 by drawing a square of 12 small 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:50.530
 tiles on each side or 6 centimeters 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.079
 if you do not have small leaves 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.079
 tiles then draw a triangle 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:58.600
 in front of each side of your square that 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.129
 will make two authors also 12 small 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.850
 tiles or 6 centimeters 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.140
 take your protractor and draw a 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.930
 arc 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.670
 between the tip of your triangle and the 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.560
 tip of your square once your 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.880
 pattern drawn on your sheet 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.939
 you just have to cut out 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.860
 outlines in order to get your boss to 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:20.079
 your second envelope 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.509
 step is to postpone your boss 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:24.670
 on your sheet that will be intended for 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.470
 your dolly pouch once your 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.759
 drawing reporter on your sheet 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.759
 it is only necessary to cut the outlines 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.759
 we will now go to folding 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:38.890
 but before thinking about erasing the small 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.910
 pencil stroke that stays so that your 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:45.720
 box in the storm 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:49.680
 fold each petal of your box so 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:53.420
 to reform the square that you had 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.420
 drawn on your boss 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:05.920
 once the folding is completed take a 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:08.410
 needle to these big ones in order to make 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.369
 small holes on each point for 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.700
 to be able to pass 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.950
 the task do not make your hole too 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.990
 on the tip of your box otherwise you 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.600
 read that ray of tearing the paper for 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:24.550
 more easily pass your wool in 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.959
 your needles so that wool gets in 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.580
 perfectly in the little trophy 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:33.880
 previously and we pass in each 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.560
 little hole before closing your box 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:41.290
 do not forget to put some 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:45.030
 sugared almonds and make sure to return all 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.989
 the circle bows of your box 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.580
