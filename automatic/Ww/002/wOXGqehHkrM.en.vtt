and let you get your questions so what
I'm<00:01:15.780> trying<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.020> figure<00:01:16.320> out<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.880> when<00:01:17.880> we

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
I'm trying to figure out is when we

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:26.780 
I'm trying to figure out is when we
choose<00:01:21.350> we<00:01:22.350> choose<00:01:24.560> what's<00:01:25.560> or<00:01:26.100> what

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
choose we choose what's or what

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.670 
choose we choose what's or what
situations<00:01:27.390> we<00:01:27.570> want<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.930> come<00:01:28.350> into<00:01:28.500> like

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
situations we want to come into like

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.940 
situations we want to come into like
which<00:01:28.829> family<00:01:29.400> which<00:01:29.759> which<00:01:30.180> situations<00:01:30.960> like

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
which family which which situations like

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.260 
which family which which situations like
we<00:01:32.159> already<00:01:32.430> know<00:01:33.530> basically<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:35.100> think<00:01:35.520> this

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
we already know basically I think this

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.370 
we already know basically I think this
is<00:01:36.390> what<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.659> discussed<00:01:36.990> before<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.290> your

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
is what you discussed before in your

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.289 
is what you discussed before in your
tapes<00:01:37.590> where<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.460> choose<00:01:38.729> what<00:01:38.939> family<00:01:39.210> you

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
tapes where you choose what family you

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.080 
tapes where you choose what family you
want<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.540> be<00:01:39.659> in<00:01:39.780> will<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.439> choose<00:01:40.680> everything

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
want to be in will you choose everything

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.240 
want to be in will you choose everything
vibrationally<00:01:42.090> in<00:01:42.360> other<00:01:42.720> words<00:01:43.250> sometimes

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
vibrationally in other words sometimes

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.330 
vibrationally in other words sometimes
that<00:01:44.610> but<00:01:44.880> consider<00:01:45.360> this<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:48.200> eager

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
that but consider this a eager

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.100 
that but consider this a eager
non-physical<00:01:50.340> energy<00:01:51.920> excited<00:01:52.920> about<00:01:54.110> the

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
non-physical energy excited about the

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.249 
non-physical energy excited about the
variety<00:01:55.710> which<00:01:56.369> will<00:01:56.640> cause<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:57.259> spiritual

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
variety which will cause a spiritual

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.539 
variety which will cause a spiritual
revolution<00:01:58.469> within<00:01:59.159> himself<00:02:00.409> that<00:02:01.409> will<00:02:01.770> put

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
revolution within himself that will put

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.569 
revolution within himself that will put
things<00:02:03.149> into<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.600> vortex<00:02:04.170> that<00:02:04.350> are<00:02:04.799> far

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
things into the vortex that are far

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.350 
things into the vortex that are far
beyond<00:02:05.939> what<00:02:06.659> most<00:02:07.560> are<00:02:08.069> living<00:02:08.550> as<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.759> norm<00:02:09.149> on

so<00:02:11.300> that<00:02:12.280> enthusiasm<00:02:13.280> and<00:02:13.459> that<00:02:13.640> intention

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
so that enthusiasm and that intention

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.800 
so that enthusiasm and that intention
would<00:02:15.110> cause<00:02:15.620> that<00:02:16.300> consciousness<00:02:17.300> coming

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
would cause that consciousness coming

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.070 
would cause that consciousness coming
forward<00:02:18.230> to<00:02:18.769> choose<00:02:19.220> an<00:02:19.989> environment<00:02:20.989> that

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
forward to choose an environment that

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.190 
forward to choose an environment that
would<00:02:21.379> be<00:02:21.440> conducive<00:02:21.730> to<00:02:22.730> a<00:02:23.060> lot<00:02:23.390> of<00:02:23.540> asking

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
would be conducive to a lot of asking

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.309 
would be conducive to a lot of asking
and<00:02:24.489> yet<00:02:25.489> when<00:02:25.910> a<00:02:25.940> human<00:02:26.269> asks<00:02:26.810> a<00:02:26.900> question

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
and yet when a human asks a question

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.970 
and yet when a human asks a question
like<00:02:27.560> this<00:02:28.360> they<00:02:29.360> usually<00:02:29.989> aren't<00:02:30.470> taking

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
like this they usually aren't taking

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.670 
like this they usually aren't taking
into<00:02:31.220> consideration<00:02:31.370> what<00:02:32.330> the<00:02:32.720> true<00:02:33.019> intent

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
into consideration what the true intent

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.240 
into consideration what the true intent
of<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.489> source<00:02:35.030> energy<00:02:35.750> was<00:02:35.989> coming<00:02:36.530> in<00:02:36.980> and

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
of the source energy was coming in and

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.550 
of the source energy was coming in and
that's<00:02:37.549> what<00:02:37.849> makes<00:02:38.120> them<00:02:38.390> say<00:02:38.690> I<00:02:38.930> know<00:02:39.349> I

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
that's what makes them say I know I

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.670 
that's what makes them say I know I
didn't<00:02:40.040> choose<00:02:40.370> this<00:02:40.670> I<00:02:41.019> would<00:02:42.019> never<00:02:42.319> have

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
didn't choose this I would never have

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.880 
didn't choose this I would never have
chosen<00:02:43.010> that<00:02:43.459> and<00:02:43.970> so<00:02:44.780> that's<00:02:45.230> why<00:02:45.530> we<00:02:45.769> were

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
chosen that and so that's why we were
