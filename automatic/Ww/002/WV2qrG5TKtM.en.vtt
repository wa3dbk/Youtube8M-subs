sound is a massive components of any
horror<00:00:35.880> experience<00:00:36.150> and<00:00:37.050> that's<00:00:37.140> definitely

horror experience and that's definitely

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.610 
horror experience and that's definitely
the<00:00:37.710> case<00:00:37.740> with<00:00:37.920> alien<00:00:39.080> we<00:00:40.080> wanted<00:00:40.380> to<00:00:40.440> be<00:00:40.530> as

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
the case with alien we wanted to be as

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.229 
the case with alien we wanted to be as
authentic<00:00:41.070> as<00:00:41.190> possible<00:00:41.220> when<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:41.790> came<00:00:42.030> to

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
authentic as possible when it came to

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.490 
authentic as possible when it came to
recreating<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.989> sound<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.380> the<00:00:43.440> original

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
recreating the sound of the original

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.530 
recreating the sound of the original
music<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.340> so<00:00:44.760> we<00:00:44.850> put<00:00:45.000> together<00:00:45.120> our<00:00:45.390> own

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
music and so we put together our own

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.690 
music and so we put together our own
Orchestra<00:00:46.110> from<00:00:46.470> the<00:00:46.860> best<00:00:47.130> musicians<00:00:47.550> that

we knew around London including some who

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.380 
we knew around London including some who
had<00:00:50.160> actually<00:00:50.280> played<00:00:50.700> on<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.910> original

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390

one<00:01:15.580> of<00:01:15.700> the<00:01:15.760> most<00:01:15.970> exciting<00:01:16.330> aspects<00:01:16.990> of

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
one of the most exciting aspects of

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.390 
one of the most exciting aspects of
working<00:01:17.290> on<00:01:17.500> the<00:01:17.590> sound<00:01:17.800> for<00:01:17.950> alien<00:01:18.280> isolation

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
working on the sound for alien isolation

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.820 
working on the sound for alien isolation
was<00:01:19.390> there<00:01:19.570> we<00:01:19.660> were<00:01:19.780> given<00:01:20.020> access<00:01:20.200> to<00:01:20.470> the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
was there we were given access to the

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.440 
was there we were given access to the
original<00:01:20.920> sound<00:01:21.430> recordings<00:01:21.970> from<00:01:22.060> the<00:01:22.240> first

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
original sound recordings from the first

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
original sound recordings from the first
film<00:01:22.750> followed<00:01:23.440> a<00:01:23.880> section<00:01:24.880> 8<00:01:28.260> we<00:01:29.260> were<00:01:29.350> very

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
film followed a section 8 we were very

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.350 
film followed a section 8 we were very
lucky<00:01:29.710> because<00:01:30.010> we<00:01:30.400> were<00:01:30.520> able<00:01:30.610> to<00:01:30.790> find<00:01:31.060> some

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
lucky because we were able to find some

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.420 
lucky because we were able to find some
very<00:01:31.690> old<00:01:31.780> recordings<00:01:32.530> which<00:01:32.860> showed<00:01:33.280> the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
very old recordings which showed the

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:34.890 
very old recordings which showed the
process<00:01:33.820> by<00:01:34.000> which<00:01:34.030> the<00:01:34.300> sound<00:01:34.540> designers

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
process by which the sound designers

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.330 
process by which the sound designers
created<00:01:35.320> a<00:01:35.350> lot<00:01:35.500> of<00:01:35.590> those<00:01:35.710> sounds<00:01:36.100> and<00:01:36.280> we

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
created a lot of those sounds and we

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.520 
created a lot of those sounds and we
were<00:01:36.460> able<00:01:36.550> to<00:01:36.729> recreate<00:01:37.720> that<00:01:37.990> process<00:01:38.380> as

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
were able to recreate that process as

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:54.990 
were able to recreate that process as
accurately<00:01:38.979> as<00:01:39.100> we<00:01:39.130> could

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.840 

we<00:01:55.840> have<00:01:55.990> this<00:01:56.170> really<00:01:56.530> unpredictable<00:01:57.190> clever

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
we have this really unpredictable clever

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.480 
we have this really unpredictable clever
adaptive<00:01:58.600> alien<00:01:59.020> and<00:01:59.200> we<00:01:59.830> needed<00:02:00.070> to<00:02:00.160> build<00:02:00.310> a

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
adaptive alien and we needed to build a

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.100 
adaptive alien and we needed to build a
sound<00:02:00.730> engine<00:02:01.120> that<00:02:01.390> could<00:02:01.600> help<00:02:01.960> support

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
sound engine that could help support

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.200 
sound engine that could help support
that<00:02:02.560> we<00:02:02.830> couldn't<00:02:03.160> just<00:02:03.220> have<00:02:03.490> a<00:02:03.550> mix<00:02:04.000> that

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
that we couldn't just have a mix that

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.690 
that we couldn't just have a mix that
was<00:02:04.360> static<00:02:04.810> we<00:02:05.500> needed<00:02:05.860> a<00:02:05.950> score<00:02:06.250> that<00:02:06.280> could

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
was static we needed a score that could

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.570 
was static we needed a score that could
change<00:02:07.090> and<00:02:07.540> it<00:02:08.050> could<00:02:08.259> adapt<00:02:08.920> based<00:02:09.220> on<00:02:09.460> what

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
change and it could adapt based on what

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.950 
change and it could adapt based on what
the<00:02:09.670> play<00:02:09.850> is<00:02:09.910> doing<00:02:10.240> and<00:02:10.420> based<00:02:10.570> on<00:02:10.720> what<00:02:10.869> the

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
the play is doing and based on what the

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.860 
the play is doing and based on what the
alien<00:02:11.260> was<00:02:11.380> doing<00:02:14.880> if<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:16.030> player<00:02:16.270> is<00:02:16.480> hiding

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
alien was doing if the player is hiding

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.540 
alien was doing if the player is hiding
from<00:02:16.960> the<00:02:17.140> alien<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.800> sound<00:02:18.070> engine<00:02:18.430> will

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
from the alien the sound engine will

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.190 
from the alien the sound engine will
know<00:02:18.730> that<00:02:19.000> and<00:02:19.240> it<00:02:19.330> will<00:02:19.450> adapt<00:02:19.750> it'll<00:02:20.020> make

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
know that and it will adapt it'll make

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.160 
know that and it will adapt it'll make
it<00:02:20.350> more<00:02:20.470> tense

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
it more tense

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.080 
it more tense
the<00:02:23.170> idea<00:02:23.590> is<00:02:23.860> to<00:02:24.040> drive<00:02:24.340> an<00:02:24.550> emotional

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
the idea is to drive an emotional

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.150 
the idea is to drive an emotional
reaction<00:02:25.540> from<00:02:25.660> the<00:02:25.840> player<00:02:26.080> but<00:02:26.800> our<00:02:26.950> game

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
reaction from the player but our game

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.580 
reaction from the player but our game
sound<00:02:27.580> is<00:02:27.670> critical<00:02:28.209> because<00:02:28.660> when<00:02:29.470> you're

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
sound is critical because when you're

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.500 
sound is critical because when you're
hiding<00:02:29.770> in<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.010> dog<00:02:30.220> where<00:02:30.940> you<00:02:31.000> can<00:02:31.150> hear

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
hiding in the dog where you can hear

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.280 
hiding in the dog where you can hear
might<00:02:32.470> just<00:02:32.620> be<00:02:32.709> the<00:02:32.800> key<00:02:32.950> to<00:02:33.010> your<00:02:33.130> survival
