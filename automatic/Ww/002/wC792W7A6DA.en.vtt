00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
over the past number of years the guitar

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.530 
over the past number of years the guitar
that<00:00:10.679> are<00:00:12.139> the<00:00:13.139> grandmasters<00:00:14.089> would<00:00:15.089> be<00:00:15.299> most

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
that are the grandmasters would be most

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.910 
that are the grandmasters would be most
familiar<00:00:15.809> with<00:00:16.199> would<00:00:16.680> be<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:18.560> softer<00:00:19.560> sounding

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
familiar with would be a softer sounding

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.099 
familiar with would be a softer sounding
straying<00:00:20.250> made<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.640> catgut<00:00:20.970> which<00:00:21.660> today

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
straying made of catgut which today

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.730 
straying made of catgut which today
would<00:00:22.350> be<00:00:22.560> nylon<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.519> it<00:00:24.119> has<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.600> very<00:00:25.260> pretty

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
would be nylon and it has a very pretty

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:33.389 
would be nylon and it has a very pretty
sound

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:33.399 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:36.760 

so<00:00:34.399> that<00:00:34.730> is<00:00:34.910> a<00:00:34.940> nylon<00:00:35.690> string<00:00:36.079> guitar<00:00:36.110> sound

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
as we change these sounds around as we

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.790 
as we change these sounds around as we
use<00:00:41.390> the<00:00:41.660> full<00:00:41.899> capability<00:00:42.649> of<00:00:42.680> these
