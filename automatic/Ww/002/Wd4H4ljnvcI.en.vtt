prepare for the king creation checkout
create<00:00:59.890> you<00:01:00.190> that<00:01:00.579> program<00:01:01.059> at<00:01:01.210> the<00:01:01.360> P&amp;L<00:01:01.960> tree

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.569 

okay<00:01:10.939> then<00:01:11.149> here<00:01:11.600> all<00:01:11.930> you<00:01:12.110> gotta<00:01:12.259> do<00:01:12.469> is<00:01:12.500> go<00:01:13.430> in

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:13.579 
okay then here all you gotta do is go in

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:16.090 
okay then here all you gotta do is go in
the<00:01:13.670> back<00:01:14.380> assuming<00:01:15.380> also<00:01:15.649> you<00:01:15.740> having<00:01:16.009> to

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
the back assuming also you having to

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.669 
the back assuming also you having to
change<00:01:16.280> the<00:01:16.460> control<00:01:16.820> is<00:01:18.310> see<00:01:20.679> that's

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:21.679 
change the control is see that's

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:25.120 
change the control is see that's
probably<00:01:22.039> the<00:01:22.189> simplest<00:01:22.490> one<00:01:22.820> there<00:01:22.969> is<00:01:24.130> then

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
probably the simplest one there is then

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.350 
probably the simplest one there is then
this<00:01:25.310> one<00:01:25.579> is<00:01:25.759> the<00:01:25.789> box<00:01:26.689> charge<00:01:27.140> you<00:01:27.799> stuff<00:01:28.360> use

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:40.330 
this one is the box charge you stuff use
box<00:01:29.689> form<00:01:30.079> to<00:01:30.200> destroy<00:01:30.619> the<00:01:30.829> boxes<00:01:39.159> so<00:01:40.159> there

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
box form to destroy the boxes so there

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.770 
box form to destroy the boxes so there
you<00:01:40.429> go<00:01:40.580> we<00:01:40.759> just<00:01:40.789> set<00:01:41.090> it<00:01:41.209> right<00:01:41.299> there<00:01:41.360> for
