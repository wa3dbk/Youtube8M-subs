do<00:03:05.629> this<00:03:05.719> but<00:03:05.780> I<00:03:06.230> saw<00:03:06.859> that<00:03:07.099> if<00:03:07.310> I<00:03:07.400> drop<00:03:07.639> one

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:07.669 
do this but I saw that if I drop one

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:09.640 
do this but I saw that if I drop one
goal<00:03:08.180> in<00:03:08.209> there<00:03:08.540> and<00:03:08.780> then<00:03:09.109> a<00:03:09.169> couple<00:03:09.319> ways<00:03:09.560> is

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
goal in there and then a couple ways is

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:10.959 
goal in there and then a couple ways is
behind<00:03:09.889> i<00:03:10.099> could<00:03:10.250> get<00:03:10.579> a<00:03:10.669> few<00:03:10.909> extra

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:10.969 
behind i could get a few extra

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:12.640 
behind i could get a few extra
percentage<00:03:11.599> points<00:03:12.049> and<00:03:12.169> also<00:03:12.319> maybe<00:03:12.469> get

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
percentage points and also maybe get

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.649 
percentage points and also maybe get
some<00:03:12.769> gold<00:03:13.010> didn't<00:03:13.909> work<00:03:14.090> as<00:03:14.239> well<00:03:14.269> as<00:03:14.450> i

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:14.659 
some gold didn't work as well as i

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:16.240 
some gold didn't work as well as i
wanted<00:03:14.840> because<00:03:15.109> of<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.290> big<00:03:15.439> bomb<00:03:15.620> and<00:03:15.919> of

wanted because of the big bomb and of
course<00:03:16.280> that<00:03:16.549> wizard<00:03:16.819> tower<00:03:16.939> got<00:03:17.150> lucky<00:03:17.450> but

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
course that wizard tower got lucky but

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:20.469 
course that wizard tower got lucky but
it<00:03:18.349> did<00:03:18.590> go<00:03:18.769> decent<00:03:19.519> and<00:03:19.700> you<00:03:20.060> can<00:03:20.209> see<00:03:20.329> all

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:20.479 
it did go decent and you can see all

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:21.759 
it did go decent and you can see all
those<00:03:20.599> little<00:03:20.690> traps<00:03:21.079> really<00:03:21.349> messed<00:03:21.530> up<00:03:21.650> my

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
those little traps really messed up my

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.149 
those little traps really messed up my
Wizards<00:03:22.129> a<00:03:22.280> very<00:03:22.940> unfortunate<00:03:23.169> but<00:03:24.169> anyway<00:03:24.889> on

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:25.159 
Wizards a very unfortunate but anyway on

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:27.159 
Wizards a very unfortunate but anyway on
the<00:03:25.370> other<00:03:25.489> side<00:03:25.579> I<00:03:25.790> dropped<00:03:26.180> down<00:03:26.299> for<00:03:26.720> golems

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:27.169 
the other side I dropped down for golems

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:28.629 
the other side I dropped down for golems
and<00:03:27.319> my<00:03:27.470> client<00:03:27.829> cast<00:03:28.010> which<00:03:28.190> had<00:03:28.370> a<00:03:28.400> goal<00:03:28.609> a

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:28.639 
and my client cast which had a goal a

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:30.430 
and my client cast which had a goal a
minute<00:03:28.940> and<00:03:29.060> then<00:03:29.540> once<00:03:29.870> they're<00:03:30.019> in<00:03:30.169> the<00:03:30.290> base

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
minute and then once they're in the base

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.920 
minute and then once they're in the base
I<00:03:30.739> actually<00:03:31.250> dropped<00:03:31.669> all<00:03:31.849> of<00:03:32.329> my<00:03:32.599> wall

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
I actually dropped all of my wall

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.569 
I actually dropped all of my wall
breakers<00:03:33.290> to<00:03:33.439> get<00:03:33.560> to<00:03:33.650> that<00:03:33.739> center<00:03:34.129> piece<00:03:34.310> and

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
breakers to get to that center piece and

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:36.610 
breakers to get to that center piece and
it<00:03:34.669> works<00:03:35.090> because<00:03:35.329> the<00:03:35.689> golems<00:03:36.049> took<00:03:36.319> over

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
it works because the golems took over

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.670 
it works because the golems took over
the<00:03:36.829> inferno<00:03:37.220> tower<00:03:37.459> and<00:03:37.790> now<00:03:38.329> it's<00:03:38.900> all<00:03:39.169> havoc

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.909 
thought for the update so it's really
easy<00:04:54.270> to<00:04:54.389> take<00:04:54.509> out<00:04:54.599> army<00:04:54.900> camps<00:04:55.169> guys<00:04:55.319> it's

00:04:59.119 --> 00:04:59.129 
super easy now also on top of that we do

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:00.830 
super easy now also on top of that we do
have<00:04:59.250> access<00:04:59.490> to<00:04:59.819> of<00:05:00.030> course<00:05:00.240> a<00:05:00.389> few<00:05:00.689> buildings

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
have access to of course a few buildings

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.510 
have access to of course a few buildings
on<00:05:01.050> the<00:05:01.110> other<00:05:01.259> side<00:05:01.469> of<00:05:01.500> the<00:05:01.590> base<00:05:01.770> like<00:05:02.370> this

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
on the other side of the base like this

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.209 
on the other side of the base like this
barracks<00:05:02.879> and<00:05:03.139> also<00:05:04.139> this<00:05:04.469> builder<00:05:04.860> so<00:05:05.009> it

00:05:05.209 --> 00:05:05.219 
barracks and also this builder so it

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:06.950 
barracks and also this builder so it
gives<00:05:05.370> us<00:05:05.550> over<00:05:05.879> fifty<00:05:06.210> three<00:05:06.389> percent<00:05:06.419> and

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
gives us over fifty three percent and

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.749 
gives us over fifty three percent and

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:01.820 
base first and then worrying about
spreading<00:06:00.870> out<00:06:01.050> from<00:06:01.080> there<00:06:01.379> because<00:06:01.650> once

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
spreading out from there because once

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.079 
spreading out from there because once
you're<00:06:01.949> that<00:06:02.039> big<00:06:02.219> compartment<00:06:02.490> your<00:06:02.819> troops

00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:03.089 
you're that big compartment your troops

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:04.429 
you're that big compartment your troops
are<00:06:03.180> going<00:06:03.300> to<00:06:03.360> spread<00:06:03.599> out<00:06:03.750> there<00:06:04.289> obviously

00:06:04.429 --> 00:06:04.439 
are going to spread out there obviously

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:06.740 
are going to spread out there obviously
to<00:06:04.710> go<00:06:04.800> for<00:06:04.949> the<00:06:04.979> center<00:06:05.339> or<00:06:05.490> the<00:06:05.520> sides<00:06:05.879> and<00:06:06.120> it

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
to go for the center or the sides and it

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.029 
to go for the center or the sides and it
just<00:06:06.930> give<00:06:07.080> way<00:06:07.289> better<00:06:07.409> odds<00:06:07.620> when<00:06:07.800> you<00:06:07.889> use

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 
just give way better odds when you use

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:09.200 
just give way better odds when you use
so<00:06:08.159> you<00:06:08.189> come<00:06:08.400> from<00:06:08.490> the<00:06:08.610> south<00:06:08.819> side<00:06:09.060> of<00:06:09.150> this

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
so you come from the south side of this

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:10.999 
so you come from the south side of this
base<00:06:09.449> and<00:06:09.689> you<00:06:10.409> go<00:06:10.439> through<00:06:10.710> the<00:06:10.770> walls

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:11.009 
base and you go through the walls

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:13.100 
base and you go through the walls
obviously<00:06:11.759> with<00:06:11.849> that<00:06:11.969> rage<00:06:12.150> felt<00:06:12.419> a<00:06:12.599> double

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
obviously with that rage felt a double

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.779 
obviously with that rage felt a double
wall<00:06:13.289> breaker<00:06:13.560> like<00:06:13.860> so<00:06:14.129> actually<00:06:14.520> at<00:06:14.580> three

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:14.789 
wall breaker like so actually at three

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:16.429 
wall breaker like so actually at three
but<00:06:14.939> two<00:06:15.000> will<00:06:15.419> go<00:06:15.539> through<00:06:15.810> that<00:06:15.900> blue<00:06:16.229> wall

00:06:16.429 --> 00:06:16.439 
but two will go through that blue wall

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:18.890 
but two will go through that blue wall
without<00:06:16.620> a<00:06:16.889> problem<00:06:17.610> at<00:06:17.759> all<00:06:17.789> and<00:06:18.150> now<00:06:18.659> my
