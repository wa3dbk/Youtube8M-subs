00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.389
 hi everyone these reactions are going 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.040
 find themselves today for a 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.139
 new very special video 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.960
 since it will be very short 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.869
 this is a javelin spot on on 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.340
 terminal on modern warfare 3 so I 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.830
 know that a lot of people know him 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.060
 already on modern warfare 2 but I had 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.220
 want to show you that it works 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.489
 well and truly on modern warfare 3 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.510
 we start right away for the video 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.680
 so this is happening at the beginning of 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.690
 party in domination 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.790
 you have to be on the side of these 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.430
 voices there you place yourself well where I 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.309
 place me you aim this window of 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.469
 shot over to the right window at 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.730
 above them well in the middle of 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.559
 well in the middle of the window 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.260
 so here I make a stop on your image 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.570
 for good clean well you see 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.059
 that's right in the middle of the window and there 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.440
 you shoot and very logically if all 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.480
 the enemies will take down you 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.939
 do a multi who I will make myself a 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.590
 triple we will follow the destination of the 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.950
 query for a little better understand this 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.950
 that is happening 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.530
 then you see well before in full 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.049
 middle of the flag at the top 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.439
 so if all the enemies go on there 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:27.310
 there is no problem normally a 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:28.689
 new view of the rocket with the 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.240
 little slow here and all enemies 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:33.340
 who dies so I want to clarify that 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.090
 this spot is not necessarily realizable 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.799
 beginning of the game 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.020
 for example if there are campers what 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.569
 very often happens to you do that 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.659
 and here I am, I wanted you 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:46.780
 show one another example where I'm going 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:52.140
 do I'm going to do a multi that's it 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.140
 so well in the middle of the window and the 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.229
 one 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:03.570
 this is it so I hope this 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:07.030
 small short video will have pleased you 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.100
 I hope you will have learned 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.250
 in my video if you already knew 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.570
 this spot well bah too bad and if you 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.070
 do not know if you do not know 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.020
 happy to have taught you 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.550
 I hope you will do multiples like 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.550
 I am hi everyone
