00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
so what this does is this end plugs into

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.490 
so what this does is this end plugs into
your<00:01:08.000> Intellivision<00:01:09.000> just<00:01:09.990> like<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.170> game

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
your Intellivision just like a game

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.780 
your Intellivision just like a game
would<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.330> on<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.540> other<00:01:12.720> end<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.580> where<00:01:14.580> you

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
would and on the other end is where you

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.570 
would and on the other end is where you
plug<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.240> your<00:01:15.360> game<00:01:16.040> now<00:01:17.930> certain<00:01:18.930> games

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
plug in your game now certain games

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.210 
plug in your game now certain games
would<00:01:20.580> have<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.420> guess<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.750> coal<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.439> cold<00:01:22.799> in<00:01:23.040> them

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
would have I guess a coal a cold in them

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.050 
would have I guess a coal a cold in them
or<00:01:23.400> something<00:01:23.430> like<00:01:23.729> that

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
or something like that

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.469 
or something like that
to<00:01:24.869> activate<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.920> voice<00:01:26.280> through<00:01:26.670> this<00:01:26.850> box<00:01:27.119> so

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
to activate a voice through this box so

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.660 
to activate a voice through this box so
in<00:01:27.630> other<00:01:27.720> words<00:01:27.960> if<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.710> say<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.130> had<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.369> baseball

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
in other words if I say I had a baseball

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.520 
in other words if I say I had a baseball
game<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.150> clip<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.600> in<00:01:30.810> here<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.200> guess<00:01:31.380> it

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
game I clip it in here and I guess it

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.590 
game I clip it in here and I guess it
would<00:01:31.619> read<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.890> code<00:01:32.220> at<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.520> certain<00:01:32.850> time<00:01:33.360> in

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
would read a code at a certain time in

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.440 
would read a code at a certain time in
the<00:01:33.689> game<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.710> would<00:01:34.799> translate<00:01:35.280> into<00:01:35.729> a

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
the game and it would translate into a

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.219 
the game and it would translate into a
voice<00:01:36.930> coming<00:01:37.320> out<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.650> this<00:01:37.770> box<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:39.229> that's

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
voice coming out of this box and that's
