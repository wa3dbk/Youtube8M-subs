00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:02.829 
obviously start hanging down a little
bit<00:01:01.160> lower<00:01:01.370> you<00:01:01.879> do<00:01:02.030> need<00:01:02.239> still<00:01:02.510> to<00:01:02.660> be<00:01:02.750> able

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
bit lower you do need still to be able

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:04.299 
bit lower you do need still to be able
to<00:01:02.960> cover<00:01:03.140> this<00:01:03.350> and<00:01:03.530> it<00:01:03.620> will<00:01:03.800> allow<00:01:04.100> you<00:01:04.160> to

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.990 
to cover this and it will allow you to
do<00:01:04.580> that<00:01:05.680> it<00:01:06.680> goes<00:01:06.860> completely<00:01:07.100> underneath

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
do that it goes completely underneath

off<00:05:24.700> for<00:05:25.700> folding<00:05:26.120> down<00:05:26.360> it<00:05:27.230> will<00:05:27.590> fold<00:05:27.950> down

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
off for folding down it will fold down

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.030 
off for folding down it will fold down
with<00:05:28.550> your<00:05:28.669> push<00:05:28.910> curbing<00:05:29.419> in<00:05:29.660> this<00:05:29.900> mode<00:05:30.260> but

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.040 
with your push curbing in this mode but

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.040 
with your push curbing in this mode but
it<00:05:31.160> won't<00:05:31.550> if<00:05:31.820> it's<00:05:32.000> fault<00:05:32.300> if<00:05:32.540> it's<00:05:32.810> facing

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
it won't if it's fault if it's facing

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.930 
it won't if it's fault if it's facing
towards<00:05:33.680> you<00:05:36.220> we're<00:05:37.220> going<00:05:37.340> to<00:05:37.460> fold<00:05:37.700> it<00:05:37.880> down

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940 
towards you we're going to fold it down

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.380 
towards you we're going to fold it down
I<00:05:39.100> personally<00:05:40.100> find<00:05:40.310> it<00:05:40.520> easier<00:05:40.910> from<00:05:41.120> this

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:41.390 
I personally find it easier from this

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.030 
I personally find it easier from this
side<00:05:41.660> and<00:05:41.990> that's<00:05:42.440> because<00:05:42.710> I'm<00:05:42.830> not

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:43.040 
side and that's because I'm not

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.600 
side and that's because I'm not
particularly<00:05:43.490> tall<00:05:43.970> if<00:05:44.840> you<00:05:45.500> are<00:05:45.680> taller<00:05:46.040> you

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
particularly tall if you are taller you

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.000 
particularly tall if you are taller you
may<00:05:46.790> be<00:05:46.850> able<00:05:47.060> to<00:05:47.180> go<00:05:47.360> over<00:05:47.600> the<00:05:47.750> handle<00:05:48.710> quite

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
may be able to go over the handle quite

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:50.680 
may be able to go over the handle quite
a<00:05:49.040> lot<00:05:49.340> easier<00:05:49.370> but<00:05:49.850> as<00:05:50.000> I<00:05:50.030> say<00:05:50.270> because<00:05:50.540> I'm

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
a lot easier but as I say because I'm

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.200 
a lot easier but as I say because I'm
slightly<00:05:50.870> shorter<00:05:51.380> I<00:05:51.410> struggle<00:05:51.890> slightly<00:05:52.430> so

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
slightly shorter I struggle slightly so

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:54.670 
slightly shorter I struggle slightly so
all<00:05:53.360> that<00:05:53.540> you're<00:05:53.630> going<00:05:53.780> to<00:05:53.900> do<00:05:54.110> you've<00:05:54.470> got<00:05:54.500> a

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
all that you're going to do you've got a

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.800 
all that you're going to do you've got a
grey<00:05:54.950> button<00:05:55.340> on<00:05:55.430> the<00:05:55.520> side<00:05:55.760> here<00:05:56.150> and<00:05:56.330> one

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
grey button on the side here and one

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.980 
grey button on the side here and one
here<00:05:57.280> that<00:05:58.280> one<00:05:58.550> presses<00:05:59.000> directly<00:05:59.540> downwards

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
here that one presses directly downwards

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.440 
here that one presses directly downwards
towards<00:06:00.440> the<00:06:00.530> floor<00:06:00.800> and<00:06:01.100> that<00:06:01.850> one<00:06:02.030> flies

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:02.450 
towards the floor and that one flies

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.270 
towards the floor and that one flies
towards<00:06:03.140> you<00:06:03.260> so<00:06:03.380> I'm<00:06:03.470> just<00:06:03.560> gonna<00:06:03.710> roll<00:06:04.010> that

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 
towards you so I'm just gonna roll that

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.730 
towards you so I'm just gonna roll that
towards<00:06:04.820> me<00:06:04.970> and<00:06:05.270> pull<00:06:05.840> the<00:06:05.960> whole<00:06:06.169> thing<00:06:06.200> down

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740 
towards me and pull the whole thing down

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.950 
towards me and pull the whole thing down
you'll<00:06:07.340> find<00:06:07.640> it<00:06:07.790> does<00:06:07.970> feel<00:06:08.210> quite<00:06:08.540> stiff

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 
you'll find it does feel quite stiff

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.610 
you'll find it does feel quite stiff
because<00:06:09.320> it<00:06:09.650> is<00:06:09.800> hydraulic<00:06:10.610> and<00:06:11.440> then<00:06:12.440> what

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
because it is hydraulic and then what

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.440 
because it is hydraulic and then what
you'll<00:06:12.740> also<00:06:12.950> find<00:06:13.160> is<00:06:13.580> you<00:06:13.790> have<00:06:13.970> got<00:06:14.150> a<00:06:14.210> clip

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:14.450 
you'll also find is you have got a clip

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:18.370 
you'll also find is you have got a clip
on<00:06:14.630> the<00:06:14.750> side<00:06:14.780> here<00:06:15.350> just<00:06:16.240> latches<00:06:17.240> on<00:06:17.479> to<00:06:18.260> the

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:18.380 
on the side here just latches on to the

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.100 
on the side here just latches on to the
chassis<00:06:18.860> and<00:06:19.250> then<00:06:19.820> it<00:06:19.940> allows<00:06:20.240> you<00:06:20.510> either<00:06:20.720> to

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
chassis and then it allows you either to

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.350 
chassis and then it allows you either to
lift<00:06:21.290> up<00:06:21.440> exactly<00:06:21.919> as<00:06:21.979> we've<00:06:22.100> got<00:06:22.220> it<00:06:22.310> here<00:06:22.490> or

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 
lift up exactly as we've got it here or

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.909 
lift up exactly as we've got it here or
from<00:06:23.540> the<00:06:23.690> side<00:06:23.930> however<00:06:24.770> you<00:06:25.100> would<00:06:25.220> like<00:06:25.280> to

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:26.919 
from the side however you would like to

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:29.440 
from the side however you would like to
to<00:06:27.919> put<00:06:28.130> it<00:06:28.220> back<00:06:28.370> up<00:06:28.610> all<00:06:28.970> that<00:06:29.150> you're<00:06:29.270> doing

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:29.450 
to put it back up all that you're doing

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.659 
to put it back up all that you're doing
is<00:06:29.570> just<00:06:29.720> releasing<00:06:30.110> off<00:06:30.169> that<00:06:30.380> clip<00:06:30.620> and<00:06:31.490> then

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:31.669 
is just releasing off that clip and then

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:33.280 
is just releasing off that clip and then
the<00:06:31.820> choice<00:06:32.030> is<00:06:32.300> yours<00:06:32.600> you<00:06:32.720> can<00:06:32.900> either<00:06:33.020> do<00:06:33.260> it

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:33.290 
the choice is yours you can either do it

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:34.900 
the choice is yours you can either do it
by<00:06:33.380> hand<00:06:33.919> or<00:06:33.979> if<00:06:34.100> you've<00:06:34.220> got<00:06:34.400> a<00:06:34.430> child<00:06:34.700> in<00:06:34.880> your

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:34.910 
by hand or if you've got a child in your

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.930 
by hand or if you've got a child in your
arms<00:06:35.060> just<00:06:35.479> tick<00:06:35.870> it<00:06:36.050> with<00:06:36.950> your<00:06:37.160> foot<00:06:37.669> and

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:37.940 
arms just tick it with your foot and

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.420 
arms just tick it with your foot and
what<00:06:38.270> will<00:06:38.419> happen<00:06:38.570> is<00:06:38.870> that<00:06:39.080> hydraulic<00:06:39.890> will

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:40.430 
what will happen is that hydraulic will

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:41.830 
what will happen is that hydraulic will
that's<00:06:40.640> come<00:06:40.820> out<00:06:40.940> so<00:06:41.090> it's<00:06:41.210> really<00:06:41.510> really

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 
that's come out so it's really really

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.270 
that's come out so it's really really
easy<00:06:43.450> we<00:06:44.450> have<00:06:44.660> got<00:06:44.960> braking<00:06:45.680> system<00:06:46.070> on<00:06:46.160> the

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:46.280 
easy we have got braking system on the

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.240 
easy we have got braking system on the
back<00:06:46.400> here<00:06:46.700> and<00:06:47.060> all<00:06:47.540> that<00:06:47.660> we<00:06:47.750> have<00:06:47.960> red<00:06:48.770> to

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.250 
back here and all that we have red to

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:53.050 
back here and all that we have red to
put<00:06:49.370> your<00:06:49.490> brake<00:06:49.700> on<00:06:49.940> and<00:06:50.560> gray<00:06:51.670> to<00:06:52.670> take<00:06:52.880> your

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:53.060 
put your brake on and gray to take your

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:58.930 
put your brake on and gray to take your
brake<00:06:53.240> off<00:06:56.920> the<00:06:57.920> other<00:06:58.070> thing<00:06:58.340> is<00:06:58.490> as<00:06:58.640> well

00:06:58.930 --> 00:06:58.940 
brake off the other thing is as well

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.120 
brake off the other thing is as well
because<00:06:59.420> it's<00:06:59.570> a<00:06:59.660> really<00:07:00.020> small<00:07:00.350> unit<00:07:00.830> it<00:07:00.980> will

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.130 
because it's a really small unit it will

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.000 
because it's a really small unit it will
go<00:07:01.340> into<00:07:01.900> obviously<00:07:02.900> a<00:07:02.930> smaller<00:07:03.320> boot<00:07:03.620> but<00:07:03.890> if

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:04.010 
go into obviously a smaller boot but if

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:05.490 
go into obviously a smaller boot but if
you<00:07:04.130> are<00:07:04.280> slightly<00:07:04.520> struggling<00:07:05.120> for<00:07:05.270> space

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:05.500 
you are slightly struggling for space

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.480 
you are slightly struggling for space
what<00:07:06.500> you<00:07:06.530> will<00:07:06.770> find<00:07:07.070> is<00:07:07.220> you've<00:07:07.370> got

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:07.490 
what you will find is you've got

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.520 
what you will find is you've got
quick-release<00:07:07.940> wheels<00:07:08.390> and<00:07:08.720> all<00:07:09.080> you<00:07:09.290> need<00:07:09.410> to

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:09.530 
quick-release wheels and all you need to

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.380 
quick-release wheels and all you need to
do<00:07:09.680> is<00:07:09.770> just<00:07:09.890> squeeze<00:07:10.100> underneath<00:07:10.550> here<00:07:10.970> and

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:11.390 
do is just squeeze underneath here and

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.420 
do is just squeeze underneath here and
the<00:07:11.600> whole<00:07:11.810> thing<00:07:12.050> just<00:07:12.200> comes<00:07:12.470> off<00:07:12.710> so<00:07:13.220> again

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:13.430 
the whole thing just comes off so again

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:14.770 
the whole thing just comes off so again
if<00:07:13.550> you<00:07:13.610> do<00:07:13.760> want<00:07:13.970> to<00:07:14.060> make<00:07:14.210> it<00:07:14.390> a<00:07:14.450> smaller

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:14.780 
if you do want to make it a smaller

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:17.230 
if you do want to make it a smaller
package<00:07:15.290> for<00:07:15.980> instance<00:07:16.400> when<00:07:16.550> that<00:07:16.730> is<00:07:16.880> folded
