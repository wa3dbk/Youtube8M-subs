build in order to build a fort you
simply<00:01:49.149> put<00:01:49.390> it<00:01:49.479> out<00:01:49.569> from<00:01:49.780> your<00:01:49.869> hand<00:01:50.140> you<00:01:50.770> get

simply put it out from your hand you get

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.660 
simply put it out from your hand you get
a<00:01:50.979> free<00:01:51.310> cube<00:01:51.670> of<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:53.200> color<00:01:53.619> of<00:01:53.709> the<00:01:53.979> flag<00:01:54.250> ok

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
a free cube of the color of the flag ok

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.340 
a free cube of the color of the flag ok
to<00:01:54.909> add<00:01:55.030> to<00:01:55.329> it<00:01:55.479> from<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:55.780> general<00:01:56.079> supply

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
to add to it from the general supply

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.539 
to add to it from the general supply
you're<00:01:56.619> also<00:01:56.799> going<00:01:57.130> to<00:01:57.219> have<00:01:57.280> your<00:01:57.520> own

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
you're also going to have your own

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:59.039 
you're also going to have your own
supply<00:01:57.909> of<00:01:58.179> cubes<00:01:58.450> that<00:01:58.479> you<00:01:58.600> can<00:01:58.750> use<00:01:58.899> to<00:01:58.929> help

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
supply of cubes that you can use to help

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.520 
supply of cubes that you can use to help
reinforce<00:01:59.500> it<00:01:59.920> ok<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:01.270> if<00:02:01.659> I<00:02:01.810> had<00:02:01.959> that<00:02:02.200> I<00:02:02.229> could

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
reinforce it ok so if I had that I could

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.459 
reinforce it ok so if I had that I could
lie<00:02:02.740> could<00:02:02.770> build<00:02:03.039> my<00:02:03.130> port<00:02:03.369> with<00:02:03.490> that<00:02:03.670> and

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
lie could build my port with that and

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.050 
lie could build my port with that and
now<00:02:05.469> in<00:02:05.649> a<00:02:05.679> future<00:02:06.069> turn<00:02:06.280> I<00:02:06.459> would<00:02:06.609> add<00:02:06.819> a

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
now in a future turn I would add a

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.089 
now in a future turn I would add a
colonist<00:02:07.630> to<00:02:07.780> this<00:02:07.929> war<00:02:08.140> and<00:02:08.349> a<00:02:08.500> colonist<00:02:08.950> to

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
colonist to this war and a colonist to

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.100 
colonist to this war and a colonist to
this<00:02:09.250> port<00:02:09.549> so<00:02:10.209> you<00:02:10.239> can<00:02:10.420> see<00:02:10.569> it<00:02:10.690> as<00:02:10.840> I<00:02:10.959> get

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
this port so you can see it as I get

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.990 
this port so you can see it as I get
more<00:02:11.230> forces<00:02:11.650> this<00:02:11.950> is<00:02:12.040> going<00:02:12.220> to<00:02:12.280> start<00:02:12.459> go<00:02:12.670> I

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
more forces this is going to start go I

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.910 
more forces this is going to start go I
mean<00:02:13.540> your<00:02:13.750> guys<00:02:13.900> ranked<00:02:14.230> much<00:02:14.560> more<00:02:14.739> quickly

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
mean your guys ranked much more quickly

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.860 
mean your guys ranked much more quickly
now<00:02:15.849> I<00:02:16.840> can<00:02:17.349> also<00:02:17.530> if<00:02:17.920> I<00:02:18.010> wish<00:02:18.250> build<00:02:18.790> ships<00:02:19.480> and

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
now I can also if I wish build ships and

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.289 
now I can also if I wish build ships and
or<00:02:20.379> buildings<00:02:20.860> ok<00:02:21.340> these<00:02:21.970> are<00:02:22.150> a<00:02:22.180> little

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
or buildings ok these are a little

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:23.550 
or buildings ok these are a little
different<00:02:22.480> than<00:02:22.810> building<00:02:23.049> forts<00:02:23.410> you're

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
different than building forts you're

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.699 
different than building forts you're
going<00:02:23.680> to<00:02:23.739> build<00:02:23.950> buildings<00:02:24.640> behind<00:02:24.879> forts

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
going to build buildings behind forts

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.789 
going to build buildings behind forts
using<00:02:26.879> deep<00:02:27.879> colonists<00:02:28.750> from<00:02:28.900> your<00:02:29.170> fork<00:02:29.470> so

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
using deep colonists from your fork so

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.240 
using deep colonists from your fork so
the<00:02:29.920> particular<00:02:31.260> building<00:02:32.260> requires<00:02:32.890> two

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
the particular building requires two

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.920 
the particular building requires two
colonists<00:02:33.910> so<00:02:34.030> I've<00:02:34.120> moved<00:02:34.420> those<00:02:34.569> down<00:02:34.750> to

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
colonists so I've moved those down to

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.750 
colonists so I've moved those down to
here<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:35.319> now<00:02:35.379> this<00:02:35.739> Ford<00:02:36.010> has<00:02:36.160> more<00:02:36.370> room<00:02:36.579> to

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
here and now this Ford has more room to

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.520 
here and now this Ford has more room to
put<00:02:36.940> markers<00:02:37.209> before<00:02:37.510> calling<00:02:37.930> us<00:02:38.049> on<00:02:38.230> to<00:02:38.410> it

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
put markers before calling us on to it

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.660 
put markers before calling us on to it
ok

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
ok

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.900 
ok
and<00:02:41.360> the<00:02:41.720> this<00:02:42.410> gives<00:02:42.650> me<00:02:42.740> gold<00:02:43.370> for<00:02:43.610> building

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
and the this gives me gold for building

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.670 
and the this gives me gold for building
it<00:02:44.030> as<00:02:44.330> well<00:02:44.540> as<00:02:44.660> reinforcements<00:02:45.440> to<00:02:45.470> this

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
it as well as reinforcements to this

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.080 
it as well as reinforcements to this
board<00:02:45.890> if<00:02:46.010> there<00:02:46.160> were<00:02:46.220> some<00:02:46.520> stones<00:02:46.790> missing

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
board if there were some stones missing

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.320 
board if there were some stones missing
right<00:02:47.480> now<00:02:48.130> ship<00:02:49.130> is<00:02:49.370> built<00:02:49.880> in<00:02:50.090> a<00:02:50.150> very

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
right now ship is built in a very

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.750 
right now ship is built in a very
similar<00:02:50.569> fashion<00:02:50.989> or<00:02:51.590> using<00:02:51.950> more<00:02:52.190> colonists

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
similar fashion or using more colonists

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.300 
similar fashion or using more colonists
if<00:02:53.180> this<00:02:53.569> particular<00:02:54.140> colony<00:02:55.069> this

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
if this particular colony this

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.250 
if this particular colony this
particular<00:02:55.670> fort<00:02:55.910> had<00:02:56.150> four<00:02:56.450> colonists<00:02:56.989> on<00:02:57.080> it

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
particular fort had four colonists on it

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.410 
particular fort had four colonists on it
like<00:02:57.830> four<00:02:58.010> turns<00:02:58.250> from<00:02:58.430> now<00:02:58.610> yep<00:02:58.940> then<00:02:59.330> I

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
like four turns from now yep then I

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.880 
like four turns from now yep then I
would<00:02:59.540> take<00:02:59.690> these<00:02:59.870> for<00:03:00.140> meatballs<00:03:00.530> from<00:03:00.680> it

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
would take these for meatballs from it

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.800 
would take these for meatballs from it
and<00:03:01.280> move<00:03:01.459> them<00:03:01.640> over<00:03:01.760> to<00:03:01.940> here<00:03:02.180> you'll<00:03:02.630> notice

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
and move them over to here you'll notice

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.600 
and move them over to here you'll notice
that<00:03:03.200> it<00:03:03.500> doesn't<00:03:03.770> go<00:03:03.890> behind<00:03:04.190> the<00:03:04.340> floor<00:03:04.520> it

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
that it doesn't go behind the floor it

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.199 
that it doesn't go behind the floor it
goes<00:03:04.730> alongside<00:03:05.000> of<00:03:05.390> it<00:03:05.480> okay<00:03:05.950> now<00:03:06.950> as<00:03:07.280> I'm

goes alongside of it okay now as I'm

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:09.670 
goes alongside of it okay now as I'm
building<00:03:08.569> my<00:03:08.660> opponent<00:03:09.050> is<00:03:09.110> doing<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.380> exact

used to some ships give you special

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.710 
used to some ships give you special
abilities<00:03:44.770> and<00:03:45.010> so<00:03:45.670> basically<00:03:45.819> depending<00:03:46.630> the

abilities and so basically depending the

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.760 
abilities and so basically depending the
type<00:03:46.900> of<00:03:46.930> ship<00:03:47.200> you<00:03:47.319> have<00:03:47.440> you're<00:03:47.590> going<00:03:47.709> to

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
type of ship you have you're going to

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.410

gain special abilities with these with

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.210 
gain special abilities with these with
these<00:03:49.450> symbols<00:03:50.260> if<00:03:50.410> you<00:03:50.500> roll<00:03:50.650> them<00:03:50.830> gotcha

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
these symbols if you roll them gotcha

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.800 
these symbols if you roll them gotcha
you<00:03:51.520> start<00:03:51.760> the<00:03:51.910> game<00:03:51.940> rolling<00:03:52.390> three<00:03:52.630> dice

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
you start the game rolling three dice

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.340 
you start the game rolling three dice
but<00:03:53.020> as<00:03:53.230> you<00:03:53.500> clear<00:03:53.920> these<00:03:54.420> of<00:03:55.420> colonists<00:03:56.200> here

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
but as you clear these of colonists here

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.600 
but as you clear these of colonists here
you<00:03:56.470> get<00:03:56.620> additional<00:03:56.830> rerolled<00:03:57.400> an

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
you get additional rerolled an

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.479 
you get additional rerolled an
additional<00:03:58.000> dice<00:03:58.180> nice<00:03:58.480> so<00:03:59.170> I've<00:03:59.769> also<00:04:00.010> got

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
additional dice nice so I've also got

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.820 
additional dice nice so I've also got
two<00:04:00.670> things<00:04:01.120> cleared<00:04:01.540> here<00:04:01.690> so<00:04:01.870> I<00:04:01.900> get<00:04:02.260> four

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
two things cleared here so I get four

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.190 
two things cleared here so I get four
days<00:04:02.860> total<00:04:03.340> and<00:04:03.700> I<00:04:04.150> actually<00:04:04.300> get<00:04:04.569> to<00:04:04.630> rerolls

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
days total and I actually get to rerolls

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.450 
days total and I actually get to rerolls
so<00:04:05.620> I<00:04:05.650> could<00:04:05.890> roll<00:04:06.100> to<00:04:06.280> attack<00:04:06.730> is<00:04:06.910> for<00:04:07.150> it

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:10.460 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.400 

I<00:04:10.520> would<00:04:11.300> this<00:04:11.480> actually<00:04:11.960> got<00:04:12.080> a<00:04:12.110> terrible

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
I would this actually got a terrible

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.500 
I would this actually got a terrible
role<00:04:12.740> for<00:04:12.950> demonstration<00:04:13.460> purposes<00:04:13.850> I'll

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
role for demonstration purposes I'll

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.150 
role for demonstration purposes I'll
just<00:04:14.930> leave<00:04:15.080> it<00:04:15.140> like<00:04:15.320> this<00:04:15.350> they<00:04:15.770> rolled<00:04:16.010> that

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
just leave it like this they rolled that

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.690 
just leave it like this they rolled that
there<00:04:16.490> you<00:04:16.580> go<00:04:16.670> the<00:04:17.180> the<00:04:18.310> first<00:04:19.310> thing<00:04:19.460> you<00:04:19.550> do

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
there you go the the first thing you do

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:20.950 
there you go the the first thing you do
is<00:04:19.730> see<00:04:20.060> if<00:04:20.090> you<00:04:20.210> rolled<00:04:20.390> any<00:04:20.540> of<00:04:20.660> these<00:04:20.720> wheels

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:20.960 
is see if you rolled any of these wheels

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.510 
is see if you rolled any of these wheels
and<00:04:21.290> at<00:04:21.380> these<00:04:21.530> wheels<00:04:21.770> the<00:04:22.160> leadership

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
and at these wheels the leadership

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.100 
and at these wheels the leadership
symbols<00:04:22.820> make<00:04:22.970> any<00:04:23.150> sense<00:04:23.420> for<00:04:23.720> your<00:04:23.870> ships

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
symbols make any sense for your ships

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.660 
symbols make any sense for your ships
that<00:04:24.200> you<00:04:24.320> have<00:04:24.500> your<00:04:24.860> Tigers<00:04:25.280> specials

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670 
that you have your Tigers specials

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.430 
that you have your Tigers specials
especial<00:04:26.090> especially<00:04:26.180> that<00:04:26.900> didn't<00:04:27.170> happen

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
especial especially that didn't happen

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.530 
especial especially that didn't happen
in<00:04:27.560> this<00:04:27.650> case<00:04:27.920> the<00:04:28.640> next<00:04:28.940> thing<00:04:29.090> I<00:04:29.180> would<00:04:29.360> do

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
in this case the next thing I would do

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.810 
in this case the next thing I would do
is<00:04:29.750> select<00:04:30.170> an<00:04:30.350> attack<00:04:30.620> color<00:04:30.920> you<00:04:31.460> have<00:04:31.640> to

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
color and you take all of the dice of

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.260 
color and you take all of the dice of
that<00:04:35.810> color<00:04:36.050> attack<00:04:36.440> that<00:04:36.620> fork<00:04:36.920> okay<00:04:37.310> so<00:04:38.000> i

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
that color attack that fork okay so i

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.450

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
selected black as my attack color I

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:47.860 
selected black as my attack color I
would<00:04:46.850> have<00:04:46.940> selected<00:04:47.360> just<00:04:47.450> taking<00:04:47.750> one

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
would have selected just taking one

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.600 
would have selected just taking one
black<00:04:48.080> off<00:04:48.260> of<00:04:48.410> this<00:04:48.500> work

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
black off of this work

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.029

if<00:04:50.120> I<00:04:50.300> had<00:04:50.479> selected<00:04:50.810> gray<00:04:51.289> I<00:04:51.680> would<00:04:51.919> not

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 
if I had selected gray I would not

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:53.619 
if I had selected gray I would not
remove<00:04:52.250> any<00:04:52.430> gray<00:04:52.759> because<00:04:53.000> the<00:04:53.360> graves

remove any gray because the graves

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:55.540 
remove any gray because the graves
reinforce<00:04:54.139> each<00:04:54.319> other<00:04:54.469> I<00:04:54.770> would<00:04:55.129> have<00:04:55.219> had<00:04:55.400> to

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
reinforce each other I would have had to

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.279 
reinforce each other I would have had to
roll<00:04:55.759> to<00:04:56.000> gray<00:04:56.240> in<00:04:56.509> order<00:04:56.689> to<00:04:56.750> picked<00:04:56.900> off<00:04:57.080> two

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:57.289 
roll to gray in order to picked off two

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:00.399 
roll to gray in order to picked off two
great<00:04:57.560> gotcha<00:04:58.250> all<00:04:58.819> right<00:04:58.969> so<00:04:59.870> let's<00:05:00.050> say<00:05:00.199> but

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:00.409 
great gotcha all right so let's say but

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:03.360 
great gotcha all right so let's say but
I<00:05:00.469> picked<00:05:00.680> white

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.680 

as<00:05:03.850> my<00:05:04.120> color<00:05:04.389> I<00:05:04.690> took<00:05:05.380> off<00:05:05.740> his<00:05:05.889> white<00:05:06.100> cube

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
as my color I took off his white cube

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.780 
as my color I took off his white cube
and<00:05:07.690> now<00:05:08.020> I've<00:05:08.380> got<00:05:08.740> a<00:05:08.770> grain<00:05:09.160> a<00:05:09.190> black<00:05:09.520> dice

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:09.790 
and now I've got a grain a black dice

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.780 
and now I've got a grain a black dice
left<00:05:10.120> yep<00:05:10.800> there's<00:05:11.800> a<00:05:11.889> second<00:05:12.280> wave<00:05:12.460> that

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.790 
left yep there's a second wave that

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.400 
left yep there's a second wave that
occurs<00:05:13.150> and<00:05:13.419> during<00:05:13.630> that<00:05:13.690> second<00:05:14.080> way<00:05:14.139> I<00:05:14.169> can

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
occurs and during that second way I can

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.260 
occurs and during that second way I can
do<00:05:14.500> one<00:05:14.650> of<00:05:14.680> two<00:05:14.770> things<00:05:14.919> I<00:05:15.430> can<00:05:15.880> take<00:05:16.060> these

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979 
second wave of attack okay so i could

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:35.310 
second wave of attack okay so i could
take<00:05:33.100> even<00:05:33.669> a<00:05:33.729> grey<00:05:33.940> cube<00:05:34.240> off<00:05:34.419> of<00:05:34.720> his<00:05:35.020> fork
