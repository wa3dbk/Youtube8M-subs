in<00:01:46.440> addition<00:01:46.920> we've<00:01:47.130> included<00:01:47.490> apps<00:01:47.880> like

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
in addition we've included apps like

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.550 
in addition we've included apps like
code<00:01:48.479> safe<00:01:48.720> which<00:01:48.930> we<00:01:49.080> think<00:01:49.229> would<00:01:49.409> be

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
code safe which we think would be

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.250 
code safe which we think would be
assistive<00:01:50.010> apps<00:01:50.190> in<00:01:50.820> this<00:01:50.970> day<00:01:51.150> and<00:01:51.299> age<00:01:51.390> we

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
assistive apps in this day and age we

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.830 
assistive apps in this day and age we
have<00:01:52.409> loads<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:53.010> passwords<00:01:53.909> usernames<00:01:54.240> ping

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
have loads of passwords usernames ping

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.080 
have loads of passwords usernames ping
codes<00:01:55.369> perhaps<00:01:56.369> we<00:01:56.490> don't<00:01:56.670> remember<00:01:56.820> all<00:01:57.060> of

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
codes perhaps we don't remember all of

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.719 
codes perhaps we don't remember all of
them<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:58.020> when<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.650> first<00:01:58.860> open<00:01:59.159> up<00:01:59.220> code<00:01:59.460> safe

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
them so when you first open up code safe

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.340 
them so when you first open up code safe
it<00:01:59.880> will<00:01:59.970> ask<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.420> set<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.659> three<00:02:00.900> pin<00:02:01.140> code

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
it will ask you to set a three pin code

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.290 
it will ask you to set a three pin code
so<00:02:02.009> if<00:02:02.100> i<00:02:02.220> said<00:02:02.490> i've<00:02:02.610> set<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.850> code<00:02:03.119> already

that can actually age you if we come

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.670 
that can actually age you if we come
back<00:02:20.880> out<00:02:23.360> and<00:02:24.360> we'll<00:02:24.510> move<00:02:24.660> across<00:02:25.019> the<00:02:25.620> other

thing<00:02:25.950> wolves<00:02:26.190> are<00:02:26.310> done<00:02:26.459> is<00:02:26.610> that<00:02:26.790> we

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
thing wolves are done is that we

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.310 
thing wolves are done is that we
appreciate<00:02:27.450> that<00:02:27.660> when<00:02:27.780> a<00:02:27.810> customer<00:02:28.170> buys

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320

this<00:02:28.470> type<00:02:28.680> of<00:02:28.709> phone<00:02:29.010> it's<00:02:29.220> great<00:02:29.430> when

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
this type of phone it's great when

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.860 
this type of phone it's great when
you're<00:02:29.730> in<00:02:29.790> front<00:02:29.850> of<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.180> store<00:02:30.510> colleague

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
you're in front of a store colleague

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.199 
you're in front of a store colleague
who's<00:02:31.050> explaining<00:02:31.590> everything<00:02:31.800> to<00:02:31.980> you<00:02:32.340> but

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
who's explaining everything to you but

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.790 
who's explaining everything to you but
often<00:02:33.810> when<00:02:33.930> you<00:02:34.019> get<00:02:34.170> home<00:02:34.350> and<00:02:34.500> you<00:02:34.590> pull<00:02:34.769> out

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
often when you get home and you pull out

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.410 
often when you get home and you pull out
the<00:02:35.069> box<00:02:35.310> perhaps<00:02:35.550> you've<00:02:35.819> forgotten<00:02:36.090> certain

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
the box perhaps you've forgotten certain

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.360 
the box perhaps you've forgotten certain
elements<00:02:36.810> of<00:02:36.870> it<00:02:37.019> so<00:02:37.440> we've<00:02:37.590> included<00:02:37.800> on<00:02:38.160> here

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
elements of it so we've included on here

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.660 
elements of it so we've included on here
something<00:02:39.030> called<00:02:39.180> a<00:02:39.239> discover<00:02:39.600> me<00:02:39.810> up<00:02:40.670> this

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
something called a discover me up this

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.940 
something called a discover me up this
basically<00:02:42.090> allows<00:02:42.209> the<00:02:42.690> user<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:43.080> learn<00:02:43.650> about

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
basically allows the user to learn about

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.050 
basically allows the user to learn about
the<00:02:44.069> phone<00:02:44.250> again<00:02:44.430> in<00:02:44.640> case<00:02:44.850> they've

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
the phone again in case they've

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.729 
the phone again in case they've
forgotten<00:02:45.300> certain<00:02:45.720> elements<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:46.380> get<00:02:46.560> them

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
forgotten certain elements and get them

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:54.010 
forgotten certain elements and get them
more<00:02:46.890> familiar<00:02:47.310> with<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.519> device<00:02:47.790> again

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.320 

we've<00:02:54.620> also<00:02:54.830> got<00:02:55.160> other<00:02:55.370> features<00:02:55.760> which<00:02:56.180> are

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
we've also got other features which are

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.600 
we've also got other features which are
inherent<00:02:56.660> within<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.110> Dora<00:02:57.710> DNA<00:02:58.130> so<00:02:58.400> for

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
inherent within the Dora DNA so for

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.550 
inherent within the Dora DNA so for
example<00:02:59.090> you<00:03:00.050> can<00:03:00.260> adjust<00:03:00.680> the<00:03:01.220> font<00:03:01.940> size<00:03:02.560> so

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
example you can adjust the font size so

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.960 
example you can adjust the font size so
the<00:03:03.680> text<00:03:03.980> size<00:03:04.100> that<00:03:04.400> appears<00:03:05.860> and<00:03:06.860> we<00:03:07.790> can

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
the text size that appears and we can

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.460 
the text size that appears and we can
actually<00:03:08.060> increase<00:03:08.510> that<00:03:08.810> to<00:03:08.990> a<00:03:09.020> larger<00:03:09.410> size

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
actually increase that to a larger size

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.080 
actually increase that to a larger size
making<00:03:12.470> it<00:03:12.650> more<00:03:12.770> clearly<00:03:13.040> visible<00:03:13.250> on<00:03:13.670> the

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
making it more clearly visible on the

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.640 
making it more clearly visible on the
audio<00:03:14.630> side<00:03:14.840> is<00:03:14.960> where<00:03:15.080> you<00:03:15.140> can<00:03:15.290> adjust<00:03:15.380> the

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
audio side is where you can adjust the

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.680 
audio side is where you can adjust the
frequency<00:03:15.740> so<00:03:16.340> normally<00:03:17.270> when<00:03:17.360> we're<00:03:17.510> born

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
frequency so normally when we're born

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.540 
frequency so normally when we're born
our<00:03:17.870> hearings<00:03:18.200> around<00:03:18.320> 20<00:03:18.710> Hertz<00:03:18.920> 20,000

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
our hearings around 20 Hertz 20,000

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.850 
our hearings around 20 Hertz 20,000
Hertz<00:03:19.900> form<00:03:20.900> that<00:03:21.050> day<00:03:21.170> forward<00:03:21.590> we're<00:03:21.740> going

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
Hertz form that day forward we're going

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.530 
Hertz form that day forward we're going
to<00:03:21.920> start<00:03:22.160> to<00:03:22.280> loose<00:03:22.400> depending<00:03:22.820> on<00:03:22.940> what<00:03:23.300> we

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
to start to loose depending on what we

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.870 
to start to loose depending on what we
experience<00:03:23.960> for<00:03:24.050> our<00:03:24.140> lives<00:03:24.350> at<00:03:25.340> low<00:03:25.580> end<00:03:25.760> and

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
experience for our lives at low end and

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.420 
experience for our lives at low end and
the<00:03:25.970> high<00:03:26.060> end<00:03:26.740> so<00:03:27.740> when<00:03:27.890> we<00:03:27.950> think<00:03:28.070> about<00:03:28.160> this

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
the high end so when we think about this

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.310 
the high end so when we think about this
segment<00:03:29.300> you<00:03:29.420> know<00:03:29.540> we<00:03:29.720> know<00:03:29.900> that<00:03:30.140> you<00:03:30.230> know

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
segment you know we know that you know

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.600 
segment you know we know that you know
as<00:03:30.470> we<00:03:30.500> age<00:03:30.680> there's<00:03:31.040> going<00:03:31.160> to<00:03:31.220> be<00:03:31.310> some

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
as we age there's going to be some

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.820 
as we age there's going to be some
inherent<00:03:32.510> loss<00:03:32.660> of<00:03:32.840> sight<00:03:33.020> perhaps<00:03:33.470> hearing

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
inherent loss of sight perhaps hearing

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.430 
inherent loss of sight perhaps hearing
and<00:03:34.250> dexterity<00:03:34.700> to<00:03:35.540> help<00:03:35.750> kind<00:03:35.990> of<00:03:36.080> assist

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
and dexterity to help kind of assist

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.590 
and dexterity to help kind of assist
those<00:03:36.620> processes<00:03:37.190> I<00:03:37.220> mean<00:03:37.730> think<00:03:37.940> about<00:03:38.060> audio

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
those processes I mean think about audio

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.480 
those processes I mean think about audio
if<00:03:39.380> you<00:03:39.500> lose<00:03:39.620> some<00:03:39.800> of<00:03:39.830> the<00:03:39.950> high<00:03:40.070> end<00:03:40.340> a

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
if you lose some of the high end a

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.070 
if you lose some of the high end a
little<00:03:40.580> bit<00:03:40.790> like<00:03:40.910> how<00:03:41.270> a<00:03:41.300> graphic<00:03:41.690> equalizer

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
little bit like how a graphic equalizer

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.720 
little bit like how a graphic equalizer
is<00:03:42.290> on<00:03:42.410> the<00:03:42.500> hi-fi<00:03:42.680> we<00:03:43.040> can<00:03:43.220> try<00:03:43.400> and<00:03:43.460> boost

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
is on the hi-fi we can try and boost

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.180 
is on the hi-fi we can try and boost
that<00:03:43.880> so<00:03:44.150> if<00:03:44.210> we<00:03:44.330> go<00:03:44.480> into<00:03:44.600> audio<00:03:44.900> setup<00:03:45.230> we<00:03:46.010> can

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
that so if we go into audio setup we can

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.600 
that so if we go into audio setup we can
actually<00:03:46.310> select<00:03:46.640> high<00:03:47.060> on<00:03:47.330> the<00:03:47.720> audio<00:03:47.960> setup

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
actually select high on the audio setup

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.670 
actually select high on the audio setup
the<00:03:49.610> phone<00:03:49.790> normally<00:03:50.090> when<00:03:50.360> it<00:03:50.480> comes<00:03:50.780> will<00:03:51.560> be

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
the phone normally when it comes will be
