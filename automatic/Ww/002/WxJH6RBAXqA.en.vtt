symmetrical so this here is the

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.050 
symmetrical so this here is the
asymmetry<00:02:00.659> line<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.409> know

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
asymmetry line you know

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
you can you can see the symmetry line so

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.390 
you can you can see the symmetry line so
here<00:02:09.170> this<00:02:10.170> part<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.619> phase<00:02:10.800> is<00:02:11.069> the

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
here this part of phase is the

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.100 
here this part of phase is the
