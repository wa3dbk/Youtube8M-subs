00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.269 
game I just thought I'd fit it in here
this<00:00:22.390> is<00:00:22.570> actually<00:00:23.260> sardaar<00:00:23.860> my<00:00:24.070> don't

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:24.279 
this is actually sardaar my don't

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.120 
this is actually sardaar my don't
actually<00:00:24.640> think<00:00:24.820> I've<00:00:25.270> posted<00:00:26.039> using<00:00:27.039> the

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
actually think I've posted using the

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.390 
actually think I've posted using the
sidearm<00:00:27.550> before<00:00:27.850> it's<00:00:28.000> kind<00:00:28.240> of<00:00:28.410> weird<00:00:29.410> you

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 
sidearm before it's kind of weird you

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.729 
sidearm before it's kind of weird you
can't<00:00:30.609> shoot<00:00:30.789> very<00:00:31.029> fast<00:00:31.270> for<00:00:32.020> one<00:00:32.199> I<00:00:32.410> think

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
can't shoot very fast for one I think

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:34.110 
can't shoot very fast for one I think
there's<00:00:32.890> some<00:00:33.040> skill<00:00:33.489> upgrades<00:00:33.820> you<00:00:33.940> can<00:00:34.030> get

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
there's some skill upgrades you can get

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.210 
there's some skill upgrades you can get
as<00:00:34.270> well<00:00:34.449> though<00:00:34.629> to<00:00:35.230> may<00:00:35.350> possibly<00:00:35.890> make<00:00:36.070> it

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.220 
as well though to may possibly make it

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.320 
as well though to may possibly make it
shoot<00:00:36.340> faster<00:00:36.730> I<00:00:36.790> know<00:00:36.910> there's<00:00:37.090> one<00:00:37.210> to

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:37.330 
shoot faster I know there's one to

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.180 
shoot faster I know there's one to
reload<00:00:37.600> faster<00:00:37.809> and<00:00:38.290> oh<00:00:38.410> there's<00:00:38.590> one<00:00:38.680> to<00:00:38.949> swap

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
reload faster and oh there's one to swap

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.910 
reload faster and oh there's one to swap
out<00:00:39.400> your<00:00:39.550> weapons<00:00:39.879> faster<00:00:40.680> not<00:00:41.680> sure<00:00:41.890> about

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
out your weapons faster not sure about

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.500 
out your weapons faster not sure about
the<00:00:42.220> fire<00:00:42.430> rate<00:00:42.670> but<00:00:43.089> I<00:00:43.120> know<00:00:43.210> there<00:00:43.479> is

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
the fire rate but I know there is

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.310 
the fire rate but I know there is
another<00:00:43.839> side<00:00:44.470> arm<00:00:45.180> or<00:00:46.180> secondary<00:00:46.809> that<00:00:47.170> you

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
another side arm or secondary that you

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.810 
another side arm or secondary that you
can<00:00:47.559> upgrade<00:00:48.010> to<00:00:48.250> so<00:00:49.059> we<00:00:50.070> we<00:00:51.070> finished<00:00:51.430> off<00:00:51.580> a

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
can upgrade to so we we finished off a

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.329 
can upgrade to so we we finished off a
and<00:00:51.970> B<00:00:52.150> so<00:00:52.780> now<00:00:52.809> see<00:00:53.229> target<00:00:53.620> opens<00:00:53.890> up<00:00:54.070> and<00:00:54.280> we

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.339 
and B so now see target opens up and we

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:56.969 
and B so now see target opens up and we
basically<00:00:54.489> have<00:00:54.909> to<00:00:55.030> go<00:00:55.150> in<00:00:55.299> there<00:00:55.449> and<00:00:55.979> plant

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:56.979 
basically have to go in there and plant

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:02.340 
basically have to go in there and plant
the<00:00:57.100> bomb<00:00:57.250> at<00:00:57.549> sea<00:00:57.820> and<00:00:58.210> destroy<00:00:58.600> see<00:00:59.909> so<00:01:01.350> one

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
the bomb at sea and destroy see so one

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.229 
the bomb at sea and destroy see so one
thing<00:01:02.500> on<00:01:02.650> this<00:01:02.769> map<00:01:03.010> I<00:01:03.369> mean<00:01:03.879> I'm<00:01:03.970> kind<00:01:04.150> of

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
thing on this map I mean I'm kind of

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.390 
thing on this map I mean I'm kind of
going<00:01:04.360> to<00:01:04.479> the<00:01:04.570> side<00:01:04.780> here<00:01:05.049> but<00:01:05.320> I<00:01:05.560> think<00:01:06.310> I

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
going to the side here but I think I

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.070 
going to the side here but I think I
actually<00:01:06.549> show<00:01:06.850> you<00:01:06.880> the<00:01:07.180> best<00:01:07.360> the<00:01:07.659> best<00:01:07.810> way

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
actually show you the best the best way

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.440 
actually show you the best the best way
to<00:01:08.140> get<00:01:08.500> into<00:01:08.650> this<00:01:08.860> to<00:01:09.790> get<00:01:09.909> into<00:01:10.150> the<00:01:10.270> sea

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
to get into this to get into the sea

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.929 
to get into this to get into the sea
target<00:01:10.930> what<00:01:11.320> the<00:01:11.409> best<00:01:11.530> way<00:01:11.650> is<00:01:11.950> and<00:01:12.640> actually

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:12.939 
target what the best way is and actually

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:15.060 
target what the best way is and actually
see<00:01:13.149> is<00:01:13.299> set<00:01:13.570> back<00:01:13.780> a<00:01:13.840> lot<00:01:14.170> further<00:01:14.229> than<00:01:14.680> a<00:01:14.920> and

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
see is set back a lot further than a and

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.370 
see is set back a lot further than a and
B<00:01:15.189> so<00:01:15.729> you<00:01:15.820> actually<00:01:15.909> end<00:01:16.240> up<00:01:16.359> with<00:01:16.600> getting

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
B so you actually end up with getting

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.310 
B so you actually end up with getting
another<00:01:17.710> spawn<00:01:18.070> point<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:19.570> it's<00:01:19.719> basically<00:01:20.170> a

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
another spawn point and it's basically a

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.649 
another spawn point and it's basically a
plane<00:01:20.619> that<00:01:20.829> comes<00:01:21.009> in<00:01:21.219> and<00:01:21.460> you<00:01:22.149> pair<00:01:22.329> a<00:01:22.390> troop

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
plane that comes in and you pair a troop

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.599 
plane that comes in and you pair a troop
out<00:01:22.930> of<00:01:23.079> the<00:01:23.170> plane<00:01:23.409> and<00:01:23.740> that's<00:01:23.920> your<00:01:24.039> and

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:24.609 
out of the plane and that's your and

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:26.940 
out of the plane and that's your and
that's<00:01:24.789> your<00:01:24.969> new<00:01:25.000> spawn<00:01:25.359> point<00:01:25.719> so<00:01:26.439> you're<00:01:26.920> a

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
that's your new spawn point so you're a

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.889 
that's your new spawn point so you're a
lot<00:01:27.100> closer<00:01:27.340> obviously<00:01:28.149> to<00:01:28.270> see<00:01:28.450> I<00:01:28.479> mean<00:01:28.689> if<00:01:28.810> I

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
lot closer obviously to see I mean if I

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:32.730 
lot closer obviously to see I mean if I
had<00:01:28.929> to<00:01:29.049> spawn<00:01:29.289> way<00:01:29.530> back<00:01:30.810> way<00:01:31.810> in<00:01:32.109> back<00:01:32.320> of<00:01:32.380> a

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
had to spawn way back way in back of a

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.109 
had to spawn way back way in back of a
and<00:01:32.890> B<00:01:33.009> it<00:01:33.310> would<00:01:33.460> take<00:01:33.640> you<00:01:33.789> a<00:01:33.820> little<00:01:33.969> while

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
and B it would take you a little while

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.940 
and B it would take you a little while
to<00:01:34.509> get<00:01:34.600> to<00:01:34.780> see<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:38.560> again<00:01:38.710> you<00:01:38.799> gotta

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
to get to see so so again you gotta

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.560 
to get to see so so again you gotta
watch<00:01:39.130> out<00:01:39.369> here<00:01:39.549> because<00:01:39.789> guys<00:01:40.060> will<00:01:40.270> sit<00:01:40.479> up

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
watch out here because guys will sit up

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.149 
watch out here because guys will sit up
top<00:01:40.749> and<00:01:40.960> snipe<00:01:41.229> in<00:01:41.409> this<00:01:41.499> probably<00:01:41.770> know<00:01:42.009> it's

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
top and snipe in this probably know it's

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.770 
top and snipe in this probably know it's
a<00:01:42.249> good<00:01:42.340> defense<00:01:42.759> if<00:01:42.939> your<00:01:43.170> if<00:01:44.170> your<00:01:44.350> valor<00:01:45.780> to

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
a good defense if your if your valor to

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.469 
a good defense if your if your valor to
get<00:01:47.200> up<00:01:47.320> there<00:01:47.499> and<00:01:47.560> snipe<00:01:48.189> the<00:01:48.880> guys<00:01:49.030> as<00:01:49.329> our

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
get up there and snipe the guys as our

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:50.940 
get up there and snipe the guys as our
paratroop<00:01:49.869> again<00:01:50.079> you<00:01:50.229> can<00:01:50.350> even<00:01:50.439> snipe<00:01:50.770> them

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
paratroop again you can even snipe them

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.149 
paratroop again you can even snipe them
while<00:01:51.159> they're<00:01:51.369> you<00:01:51.850> know<00:01:51.909> in<00:01:52.149> midair<00:01:53.039> so<00:01:54.039> it's

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
while they're you know in midair so it's

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:55.889 
while they're you know in midair so it's
obviously<00:01:54.549> a<00:01:54.640> good<00:01:54.759> idea<00:01:54.999> now<00:01:55.329> this<00:01:55.539> is<00:01:55.600> the

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
obviously a good idea now this is the

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:58.649 
obviously a good idea now this is the
front<00:01:56.109> way<00:01:56.789> it<00:01:57.789> looks<00:01:57.969> like<00:01:58.119> these<00:01:58.210> guys<00:01:58.420> have

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
front way it looks like these guys have

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.870 
front way it looks like these guys have
some<00:01:58.960> gas<00:01:59.560> grenades<00:02:00.100> are<00:02:00.310> setting<00:02:00.579> out<00:02:00.700> and

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
some gas grenades are setting out and

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.849 
some gas grenades are setting out and
that's<00:02:00.939> again<00:02:01.420> a<00:02:01.450> good<00:02:01.689> defensive<00:02:02.350> strategy

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:02.859 
that's again a good defensive strategy

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:04.559 
that's again a good defensive strategy
to<00:02:03.069> pop<00:02:03.549> this<00:02:03.700> grenades<00:02:04.060> down<00:02:04.270> there<00:02:04.450> because

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:04.569 
to pop this grenades down there because

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:07.139 
to pop this grenades down there because
number<00:02:05.380> one<00:02:05.409> it's<00:02:05.590> going<00:02:05.889> to<00:02:06.030> deplete<00:02:07.030> your

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
number one it's going to deplete your

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.710 
number one it's going to deplete your
health<00:02:07.359> number<00:02:07.749> two<00:02:07.929> it's<00:02:08.679> going<00:02:09.069> to

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
health number two it's going to

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.360 
health number two it's going to
disorient<00:02:10.720> you<00:02:10.869> a<00:02:10.960> little<00:02:11.440> bit<00:02:11.560> as<00:02:11.740> you<00:02:12.160> come

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
disorient you a little bit as you come

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.740 
disorient you a little bit as you come
out<00:02:12.400> of<00:02:12.610> it<00:02:12.760> so<00:02:13.030> they<00:02:13.180> can<00:02:13.330> pick<00:02:13.480> you<00:02:13.600> off<00:02:13.720> a

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
out of it so they can pick you off a

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.390 
out of it so they can pick you off a
little<00:02:13.900> easier

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
little easier

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.809 
little easier
so<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:16.760> bomb<00:02:17.660> has<00:02:17.930> been<00:02:17.959> planted<00:02:18.170> it<00:02:18.739> at<00:02:19.040> sea

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
so the bomb has been planted it at sea

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.820 
so the bomb has been planted it at sea
so<00:02:20.510> we're<00:02:20.629> trying<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:20.900> rush<00:02:21.050> in<00:02:21.260> there<00:02:21.440> to<00:02:21.680> help

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
probably played really well and we've

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.790 
probably played really well and we've
been<00:04:18.190> holding<00:04:18.490> off<00:04:18.810> c4<00:04:19.810> like<00:04:20.230> a<00:04:20.260> good<00:04:20.530> 10

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:20.800 
been holding off c4 like a good 10

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.210 
been holding off c4 like a good 10
minutes<00:04:21.480> and<00:04:22.480> the<00:04:23.140> thing<00:04:23.290> is<00:04:23.350> when<00:04:23.860> when

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
minutes and the thing is when when

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.310 
minutes and the thing is when when
you're<00:04:24.340> defending<00:04:24.640> see<00:04:25.060> which<00:04:25.660> is<00:04:25.810> I<00:04:25.840> mean

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
you're defending see which is I mean

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.570 
you're defending see which is I mean
this<00:04:26.380> is<00:04:26.530> a<00:04:26.560> little<00:04:26.680> bit<00:04:26.830> different<00:04:27.130> than<00:04:27.220> a<00:04:27.340> B

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
this is a little bit different than a B

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.700 
this is a little bit different than a B
when<00:04:27.850> you're<00:04:27.970> defending<00:04:28.270> c<00:04:28.630> and<00:04:28.900> the<00:04:29.470> enemy

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
when you're defending c and the enemy

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.310 
when you're defending c and the enemy
chart<00:04:30.010> plants<00:04:30.910> the<00:04:31.060> bomb<00:04:31.240> your<00:04:31.930> tongue<00:04:32.170> your

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
chart plants the bomb your tongue your

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.390 
chart plants the bomb your tongue your
countdown<00:04:32.620> timer<00:04:32.980> stops<00:04:33.810> so<00:04:35.010> it's<00:04:36.010> a<00:04:36.220> real

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
countdown timer stops so it's a real

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.320 
countdown timer stops so it's a real
yeah<00:04:37.360> well<00:04:38.140> I<00:04:38.380> guess<00:04:38.740> we'll<00:04:38.920> see<00:04:39.130> so<00:04:39.970> they<00:04:40.120> just

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330

they<00:04:40.930> just<00:04:40.960> planted<00:04:41.500> it<00:04:41.620> but<00:04:41.740> we<00:04:41.830> neutralized

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310
