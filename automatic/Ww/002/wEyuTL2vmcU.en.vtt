00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
it just kind of blends seamlessly

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.630 
it just kind of blends seamlessly
without<00:01:23.770> losing<00:01:24.770> any<00:01:24.950> of<00:01:25.039> the<00:01:25.250> pigmentation

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
without losing any of the pigmentation

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
highlight I don't normally do that but i

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.140 
highlight I don't normally do that but i
don't<00:01:45.220> know<00:01:45.280> i<00:01:45.310> think<00:01:45.400> it<00:01:45.640> went<00:01:45.820> well<00:01:45.880> with

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
don't know i think it went well with

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.600 
don't know i think it went well with
this<00:01:46.270> look<00:01:46.509> so<00:01:46.840> I'm<00:01:47.110> gonna<00:01:47.320> Pat<00:01:47.770> that<00:01:48.070> color<00:01:48.340> on

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
and then I'm going to blend it out with

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.800 
and then I'm going to blend it out with
the<00:01:50.350> brush<00:01:50.970> all<00:01:51.970> right<00:01:52.090> so<00:01:52.299> now<00:01:52.450> I'm<00:01:52.659> working

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
the brush all right so now I'm working

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.840 
the brush all right so now I'm working
on<00:01:53.049> my<00:01:53.110> eyeliner<00:01:53.680> and<00:01:53.950> basically<00:01:54.460> all<00:01:54.580> I'm

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
on my eyeliner and basically all I'm

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.359 
on my eyeliner and basically all I'm
using<00:01:55.090> is<00:01:55.479> a<00:01:55.509> liquid<00:01:55.899> liner<00:01:56.229> and<00:01:56.530> using

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
using is a liquid liner and using

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.940 
using is a liquid liner and using
stroking<00:01:58.030> motions<00:01:58.420> as<00:01:58.570> opposed<00:01:58.899> to<00:01:59.049> just<00:01:59.080> one

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
stroking motions as opposed to just one

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.130 
stroking motions as opposed to just one
straight<00:02:00.549> fluid<00:02:01.030> motion<00:02:01.390> this<00:02:01.659> just<00:02:01.840> makes<00:02:02.020> it

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
straight fluid motion this just makes it

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.499 
straight fluid motion this just makes it
easier<00:02:02.320> to<00:02:02.560> like<00:02:02.950> I<00:02:03.190> don't<00:02:03.700> know<00:02:03.940> manipulate

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
easier to like I don't know manipulate

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:06.029 
easier to like I don't know manipulate
where<00:02:04.750> you<00:02:04.869> want<00:02:05.049> it<00:02:05.110> to<00:02:05.200> go<00:02:05.320> on<00:02:05.350> your<00:02:05.560> eye<00:02:05.590> and

this is actually a powder foundation so
this<00:05:06.489> is<00:05:06.669> basically<00:05:07.149> ultimate<00:05:08.020> coverage

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:08.289 
this is basically ultimate coverage

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:10.139 
this is basically ultimate coverage
going<00:05:08.709> on<00:05:08.830> here<00:05:09.099> but<00:05:09.519> I'm<00:05:09.669> just<00:05:09.849> blending<00:05:10.029> that

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:10.149 
going on here but I'm just blending that

00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:11.729 
going on here but I'm just blending that
all<00:05:10.389> over<00:05:10.569> my<00:05:10.689> whole<00:05:10.899> face<00:05:11.139> and<00:05:11.379> as<00:05:11.469> you<00:05:11.589> can

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:11.739 
all over my whole face and as you can

00:05:11.739 --> 00:05:13.139 
all over my whole face and as you can
see<00:05:11.769> it's<00:05:12.129> adding<00:05:12.429> a<00:05:12.489> little<00:05:12.610> bit<00:05:12.729> more<00:05:12.969> of<00:05:13.029> an

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:13.149 
see it's adding a little bit more of an

00:05:13.149 --> 00:05:15.570 
see it's adding a little bit more of an
orange<00:05:13.389> e<00:05:13.569> texture<00:05:14.080> back<00:05:14.649> into<00:05:14.949> my<00:05:15.069> face<00:05:15.309> not

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
orange e texture back into my face not

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.519 
orange e texture back into my face not
so<00:05:15.879> it's<00:05:16.029> not<00:05:16.149> so<00:05:16.330> pale<00:05:16.629> and<00:05:16.659> washed<00:05:17.199> out

00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:17.529 
so it's not so pale and washed out

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:35.999 
so it's not so pale and washed out
anymore<00:05:33.659> now<00:05:34.659> using<00:05:35.110> a<00:05:35.229> light<00:05:35.469> matte<00:05:35.740> brown

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:36.009

00:06:27.829 --> 00:06:27.839 
there's probably powder on this bra

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:31.589 
there's probably powder on this bra
brush<00:06:28.409> but<00:06:28.830> like<00:06:29.009> no<00:06:29.490> big<00:06:29.639> deal

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:31.599

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:36.310 
actually going to be using an eyeshadow

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.159 
actually going to be using an eyeshadow
that's<00:06:37.310> super<00:06:37.580> shimmery<00:06:37.910> and<00:06:38.270> we<00:06:38.750> have<00:06:38.870> it<00:06:39.020> so

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:39.169 
that's super shimmery and we have it so

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:40.330 
that's super shimmery and we have it so
dense<00:06:39.440> just<00:06:39.710> make<00:06:39.830> sure<00:06:39.949> that<00:06:40.099> you<00:06:40.190> like

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:41.810 
really blend it but I think it works

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.360 
really blend it but I think it works
just<00:06:41.960> as<00:06:42.259> well<00:06:42.319> as<00:06:42.650> long<00:06:42.800> as<00:06:42.830> you<00:06:43.009> don't<00:06:43.160> use<00:06:43.340> it

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:43.370 
just as well as long as you don't use it

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.430 
just as well as long as you don't use it
