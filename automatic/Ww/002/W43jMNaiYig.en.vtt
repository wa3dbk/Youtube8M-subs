 curly hair is said to have stayed 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.660
 then I decided to record that 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.289

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.239

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.149

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.850
 I did a Palestinian is that with some items 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.890
 some things that I find so basic 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.050

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.149

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.309
 I have are things that I think 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.520
 It's important, I just want to share with 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.600
 you to try to help, you are then 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.940
 come on 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.629
 good first of all we need to 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.640
 a shampoo and a conditioner is I do not 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.189
 I'm going to quote here Maria Castle 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.979
 because there the question of taste has people 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.420
 who likes more affordable brands 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.580
 there are people who like products 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.490
 imported so I will not stay 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.650
 Quoting marks here, I'll just speak. 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.479
 for yourselves the code items are 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.460
 essential for us to have a home for 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.009
 to take care of the hair then first of all 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.100
 a shampoo a conditioner I prefer is 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.680
 moisturizing shampoo and conditioner 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.020
 that with our hair is curly is 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.869
 curly and tends to be more dry 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.200
 so the products that are so more 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.420
 more moisturizing moisturizers will 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.079
 let the most beautiful hair will leave 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.479
 curly curly is softer then 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.680
 always prefer shampoos conditioners 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.930
 more moisturizing three types of masks 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.270
 different a moisturizing mask 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.969
 nourishing mask and a mask 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.189
 reconstructor is super important to test 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.850
 this kind of mask because our hair 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.439
 company 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.030
 isa of different types of components 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.610
 to stay beautiful and healthy then 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.220
 have three types of machines 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.590
 Being pretty essential is cool too. 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.020
 an anti-waste shampoo a lot of people do not 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.120
 like because the hair in the way of 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.680
 People are a little more dry, right? 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.750
 and there are people who do not like to apply 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.090
 because you're afraid that 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.920
 receives more hair but in my 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.319
 It is important for us to apply a 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.600
 anti-waste shampoo because people 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.370
 you need to remove all that residue from 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.680
 products that stays in our hair 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.200
 need to do a nice cleaning in 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.440
 scalp so the hair stays 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.450
 clean the root becomes clean and the hair 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.739
 develop better or better 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.019
 because otherwise it gets very much 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.750
 discontinued products just after the 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.640
 hair is losing shape in haiti 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.400
 The stranger with the passage of time went 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.010
 getting heavy so I think it's important 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.140
 then we apply a waste game 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.870
 at least once a month 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.310
 It's always there after applying a shampoo 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.220
 anti-waste is legal to make a 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.680
 hydration or nutrition to leave the 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.239
 soft hair because if you pass only the 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.739
 anti-waste shampoo and wash the 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.810
 conditioner next 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.239
 only god is going to stay in the middle prescribed yes 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.120
 so it 's cool of you to apply a mask 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.220
 soon to keep the hair more 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.079
 I was born later and it's going to be good for you. 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.239
 pass this mask after the shampoo 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.799
 anti-waste because we risk going 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.260
 be wide open 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:31.470
 so you applying the mark will judge 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.380
 well to hydration nutrition and this will not 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.600
 staying healthier is going to get more 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.239
 soft and will receive very well in 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.220
 processing is important to have oils 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.620
 vegetables 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.350
 the best known so the most 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.500
 accessible that I see here a lot of people 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.840
 using extra virgin coconut oil is the 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.120
 olive oil extra virgin olive oil 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.410
 sunflower are the eyes as well 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:00.510
 accessible is almond oil 12 also 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.370
 in various other types of vegetable oil 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.470
 So I think it's cool, we have oils there. 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.549
 vegetables if you do not want to have a 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:12.329
 a lot of vegetable oil, only one is already 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:14.340
 It's cool, I just started this way before 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:16.109
 record videos I had only one oil 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.539
 vegetable that is the extra olive oil 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.519
 A virgin had only he used to 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:23.580
 make an imitation is for the traditional 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.560
 a strengthening tonic I 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.600
 I consider it to be very important also 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.850
