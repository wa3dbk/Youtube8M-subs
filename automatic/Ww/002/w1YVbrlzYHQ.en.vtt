00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
yeah it's unfortunate the fucking

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.950 
yeah it's unfortunate the fucking
kick-ass<00:01:24.920> didn't<00:01:25.310> do<00:01:25.430> very<00:01:25.460> well<00:01:25.850> yeah<00:01:26.690> the

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
kick-ass didn't do very well yeah the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.560 
kick-ass didn't do very well yeah the
door<00:01:27.230> didn't<00:01:27.590> open<00:01:27.650> up<00:01:27.890> number<00:01:28.190> one<00:01:28.430> and<00:01:28.700> it's

door didn't open up number one and it's

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.910 
door didn't open up number one and it's
probably<00:01:30.020> not<00:01:30.170> going<00:01:30.260> to<00:01:30.320> make<00:01:30.440> it<00:01:30.500> back<00:01:30.620> its

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
probably not going to make it back its

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.820 
probably not going to make it back its
fucking<00:01:31.220> money<00:01:31.400> which<00:01:32.030> is<00:01:32.210> too<00:01:32.510> bad<00:01:32.540> I<00:01:33.050> think

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
fucking money which is too bad I think

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.200 
fucking money which is too bad I think
one<00:01:33.980> of<00:01:34.010> the<00:01:34.130> reasons<00:01:34.280> that<00:01:34.580> it<00:01:34.730> didn't<00:01:35.060> do

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
one of the reasons that it didn't do

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.690 
one of the reasons that it didn't do
very<00:01:35.240> well<00:01:35.510> was<00:01:35.900> because<00:01:36.290> it<00:01:37.160> wasn't<00:01:37.550> like

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
very well was because it wasn't like

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.090 
very well was because it wasn't like
spider-man<00:01:38.450> or<00:01:38.900> Batman<00:01:38.960> like<00:01:39.590> a<00:01:39.650> household

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
spider-man or Batman like a household

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.590 
spider-man or Batman like a household
name<00:01:40.190> that<00:01:40.490> would<00:01:40.610> know<00:01:40.760> who<00:01:41.000> the<00:01:41.090> fuck<00:01:41.300> that

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
name that would know who the fuck that

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.400 
name that would know who the fuck that

have been affected it was rated r and
the<00:01:47.600> target<00:01:47.900> audience<00:01:48.200> for<00:01:48.260> comic<00:01:48.920> book

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
the target audience for comic book

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.980 
the target audience for comic book
adventure<00:01:49.640> kind<00:01:50.030> of<00:01:50.090> stuff<00:01:50.300> his<00:01:50.450> kids<00:01:50.690> you

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
adventure kind of stuff his kids you

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.920 
adventure kind of stuff his kids you
know<00:01:51.110> so<00:01:51.920> that<00:01:52.160> cuts<00:01:52.850> up<00:01:53.030> have<00:01:53.390> your<00:01:53.570> audience

right<00:01:54.140> day<00:01:54.430> but<00:01:55.430> honestly<00:01:55.820> I<00:01:56.180> think<00:01:57.140> the<00:01:57.530> big

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
right day but honestly I think the big

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.320 
right day but honestly I think the big
reason<00:01:58.100> why<00:01:58.130> kick-ass<00:01:58.670> didn't<00:01:58.970> do<00:01:59.060> very<00:01:59.090> well

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
reason why kick-ass didn't do very well

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.240 
reason why kick-ass didn't do very well
