00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:41.190
 time before I did not say it because I have 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.190

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.550
 photos that were uploaded that are believed to 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.440
 theft has nothing to do with the money 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.200
 that the monster and big commissions that 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.399
 he had won the visa for his work 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.800
 clear and the weapon he had in his possession 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:13.750
 it was because he loves weapons and nothing 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.500
 I was that that's why he had nothing to do 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.500
 or nothing to see 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.450
 the only catfish allergic to fish 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.150
 look like state on the limit 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.299
 those who loved and could not clean 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.750
 that's why I tell you I'm allergic 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.750

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.030
 opportunity 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.320
 first come back and we remove the 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.720
 conversation 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.850
 I just said that he is a defector 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.920
 just as the gentleman you refer also 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.880

 thank you very much ricardo good afternoon 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:37.280
 with this supposedly threatening message that 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:40.230
 thiago gets quickly erases 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.010
 well and I will not talk to this gentleman 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.010
 never more 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.830
 we talk about the beginning pain in 2 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.210
 boden 2012 past and present a few 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.130
 hours the president spoke about the 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.140
 boden payment bonuses of the bonex plan 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.060
 which created annual of 2012 at the beginning of 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.460
 his government to seek a way out of the 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.890
 corralito before listening to ads 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.350
 let's remember those times when 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.820
 there was distrust present as 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.980
 believes that people can receive this 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.630
 new bonex plan thinking that Argentina 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.730
 it's a country in default and here the people 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.230
 have that fear of not charging from here to 10 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.970
 good years 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.080
 first know what the situation is 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.910
 I found people before this bonus 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.819
 he was not in better condition 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.980
 because they were not going to give him anything 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.450
 the congress does not approve 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.670
 deputies the bill that you 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.700
 they are turning in this afternoon now 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:38.299
 I suppose to open the banks and make it 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.299
 what god wants 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.070
 the feeling is that it takes too long 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.810
 and that there is a lot of zeal on the part of the 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.390
 government in terms of taking care of the free 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.520
 market in not imposing prices but the 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.960
 people feel that they are totally 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.700
 unprotected that the government is 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.320
 taking more care of companies than 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.540
 town that is that is very harmed 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.090
 so look what happens that does not exist 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.010
 been ladies there is not a state that 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.290
 be prepared to control because 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.270
 is precisely prepared for a 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:11.340
 absolutely free economy that what 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.340
 happened in recent years 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.109
 I have been that I have been going to support 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.450
 the bonex plan and if you put dollars and 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.190
 you get a bon xxi in ten years then you go 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.200
 to believe that they are going to really spend it 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.060
 that it is believed that people who are 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.760
 they say it does not save because it's the backup 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:33.040
 of the Argentine state 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:35.060
 and you respect dollars are dollars 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.340
 Oh my God 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:43.760
 what we are going to pay now 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:47.750
 the boden 2012 that is if not the money that 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:52.540
 they should have returned the banks to the 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.540
 Argentine citizens 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.720
 tourism
