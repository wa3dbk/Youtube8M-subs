00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
like I said the last I was in 2007 and

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.410

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
2009 called no one's first and your next

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.990 
2009 called no one's first and your next
and<00:00:54.620> that<00:00:55.620> was<00:00:55.739> mostly<00:00:55.949> besides<00:00:56.430> from<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.879> we

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
and that was mostly besides from the we

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.619 
and that was mostly besides from the we
were<00:00:57.149> dead<00:00:57.739> recording<00:00:58.739> session<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.449> the<00:01:00.449> big

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
were dead recording session and the big

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.060 
were dead recording session and the big
thing<00:01:00.660> about<00:01:00.840> we<00:01:01.320> were<00:01:01.440> dead<00:01:01.680> which<00:01:01.859> I

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
thing about we were dead which I

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.490 
thing about we were dead which I
personally<00:01:02.730> really<00:01:03.449> enjoyed<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.930> album<00:01:04.320> and

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
personally really enjoyed the album and

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.830 
personally really enjoyed the album and
I<00:01:04.559> think<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:05.070> reason<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.640> really<00:01:06.030> added<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.750> it

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
I think a reason it really added to it

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.390 
I think a reason it really added to it
was<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.110> fact<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.439> they<00:01:07.650> had<00:01:07.830> Johnny<00:01:08.100> Marr

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
was the fact that they had Johnny Marr

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.880 
was the fact that they had Johnny Marr

before<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.310> ship<00:02:02.340> even<00:02:02.640> sank<00:02:02.790> now<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.780> is<00:02:03.899> a

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
before the ship even sank now it is a

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.660 
before the ship even sank now it is a
long<00:02:04.229> album<00:02:04.500> just<00:02:04.740> like<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:05.009> it's<00:02:05.189> about<00:02:05.399> an

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
long album just like that it's about an

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.710 
long album just like that it's about an
hour<00:02:05.850> long<00:02:06.210> there's<00:02:06.780> 15<00:02:07.439> tracks<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.690> wow<00:02:09.690> I

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
hour long there's 15 tracks and wow I

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.900 
hour long there's 15 tracks and wow I
really<00:02:10.110> do<00:02:10.319> enjoy<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.770> lot<00:02:11.099> of<00:02:11.370> modest<00:02:11.700> mouse's

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
really do enjoy a lot of modest mouse's

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.400 
really do enjoy a lot of modest mouse's
longer<00:02:12.450> albums<00:02:12.900> I<00:02:13.050> think

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
longer albums I think

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.850 
longer albums I think
work<00:02:13.620> better<00:02:13.890> in<00:02:14.100> a<00:02:14.190> longer<00:02:14.580> format<00:02:15.090> a<00:02:15.710> lot<00:02:16.710> of

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
work better in a longer format a lot of

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.770 
work better in a longer format a lot of
the<00:02:16.920> stuff<00:02:17.130> on<00:02:17.220> this<00:02:17.310> album<00:02:17.520> does<00:02:18.120> you<00:02:18.690> know

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
the stuff on this album does you know

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.050 
the stuff on this album does you know
drag<00:02:19.170> out<00:02:19.380> a<00:02:19.410> bit<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:19.710> I<00:02:20.130> think<00:02:20.430> this<00:02:20.640> album

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
drag out a bit and I think this album

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.670 
drag out a bit and I think this album
would<00:02:21.240> have<00:02:21.360> worked<00:02:21.570> a<00:02:21.660> lot<00:02:21.780> better<00:02:21.840> if<00:02:22.260> they

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
would have worked a lot better if they

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.470 
would have worked a lot better if they
cut<00:02:22.950> a<00:02:22.980> few<00:02:23.280> tracks<00:02:23.550> and<00:02:23.880> shortened<00:02:24.270> a<00:02:24.300> few

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
cut a few tracks and shortened a few

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.410 
cut a few tracks and shortened a few
things<00:02:24.600> down<00:02:24.980> not<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.160> say<00:02:26.340> there<00:02:26.730> it's<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.210> bad

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
things down not to say there it's a bad

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.960 
things down not to say there it's a bad
album<00:02:27.660> overall<00:02:28.200> I<00:02:28.410> did<00:02:28.710> enjoy<00:02:29.130> about<00:02:29.370> half<00:02:29.790> of

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
album overall I did enjoy about half of

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.880 
album overall I did enjoy about half of
it<00:02:30.180> but<00:02:30.600> there<00:02:30.750> is<00:02:30.930> about<00:02:31.260> half<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:31.590> is

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
it but there is about half that is

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.580 
it but there is about half that is
either<00:02:32.210> redundant<00:02:33.210> or<00:02:33.330> just<00:02:33.990> rehashing<00:02:34.530> of

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
either redundant or just rehashing of

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.420 
either redundant or just rehashing of
old<00:02:34.830> ideas<00:02:36.260> singles<00:02:37.260> like<00:02:37.650> lampshades<00:02:38.280> on

old ideas singles like lampshades on

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.490 
old ideas singles like lampshades on
fire<00:02:38.670> use<00:02:39.300> a<00:02:39.330> lot<00:02:39.600> of<00:02:39.630> their<00:02:39.870> old<00:02:40.020> techniques

one of my favorite tracks on this album

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.820 
one of my favorite tracks on this album
is<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.940> ground<00:02:51.210> walks<00:02:51.540> with<00:02:51.930> time<00:02:52.290> in<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.590> box

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.850

really thought it was a classic modest
mouse<00:03:00.690> sounding<00:03:01.230> but<00:03:02.130> upon<00:03:02.640> my<00:03:02.670> second<00:03:03.270> or

third listening of the song I did

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.800 
third listening of the song I did
realize<00:03:05.040> it<00:03:05.340> sounds<00:03:05.670> a<00:03:05.730> lot<00:03:05.910> like<00:03:06.090> tiny<00:03:06.420> cities

to say that it hinders and ruins the

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.140 
to say that it hinders and ruins the

mouse<00:05:12.949> but<00:05:13.219> it's<00:05:13.370> new<00:05:13.669> and<00:05:13.939> like<00:05:14.599> I<00:05:14.629> said<00:05:14.750> with

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
mouse but it's new and like I said with

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.200 
mouse but it's new and like I said with
those<00:05:15.139> two<00:05:15.349> songs<00:05:15.590> I<00:05:15.919> did<00:05:16.310> prefer<00:05:16.729> the<00:05:16.849> second

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
those two songs I did prefer the second

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.760 
those two songs I did prefer the second
half<00:05:17.330> of<00:05:17.449> the<00:05:17.539> album<00:05:17.870> a<00:05:17.990> lot<00:05:18.199> more<00:05:18.439> than<00:05:18.500> the

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
half of the album a lot more than the

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.969 
half of the album a lot more than the
first<00:05:19.009> half<00:05:19.930> like<00:05:20.930> I<00:05:21.020> said<00:05:21.199> the<00:05:21.319> first<00:05:21.529> half<00:05:21.740> is

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
first half like I said the first half is

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:24.309 
first half like I said the first half is
a<00:05:22.009> bit<00:05:22.310> too<00:05:22.639> it's<00:05:23.330> a<00:05:23.479> bit<00:05:23.629> too<00:05:23.749> safe<00:05:24.020> in<00:05:24.199> my

00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:24.319 
a bit too it's a bit too safe in my

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:27.040 
a bit too it's a bit too safe in my
opinion<00:05:24.650> there's<00:05:25.580> a<00:05:25.639> song<00:05:25.909> called<00:05:26.240> Ansel<00:05:26.839> will

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
opinion there's a song called Ansel will

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.290 
opinion there's a song called Ansel will
just<00:05:27.229> track<00:05:27.469> 5<00:05:27.770> and<00:05:28.129> that<00:05:28.759> would<00:05:29.180> have

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
just track 5 and that would have

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.999 
just track 5 and that would have
actually<00:05:29.659> worked<00:05:29.779> a<00:05:29.960> lot<00:05:30.199> better<00:05:30.259> on<00:05:30.500> we<00:05:30.889> were

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:31.009 
actually worked a lot better on we were

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:32.769 
actually worked a lot better on we were
dead<00:05:31.219> in<00:05:31.250> my<00:05:31.490> opinion<00:05:31.819> if<00:05:32.120> it<00:05:32.240> was<00:05:32.360> paired<00:05:32.689> with

00:05:32.769 --> 00:05:32.779 
dead in my opinion if it was paired with

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:35.170 
dead in my opinion if it was paired with
but<00:05:33.139> let's<00:05:33.529> say<00:05:33.800> I<00:05:33.830> miss<00:05:34.250> the<00:05:34.430> boat<00:05:34.639> it's<00:05:35.120> a

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
but let's say I miss the boat it's a

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.689 
but let's say I miss the boat it's a
song<00:05:35.360> that<00:05:35.419> uses<00:05:35.810> steel<00:05:36.080> drums<00:05:36.500> it's<00:05:37.400> a<00:05:37.460> bit<00:05:37.610> of

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:37.699 
song that uses steel drums it's a bit of

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:40.929 
song that uses steel drums it's a bit of
a<00:05:37.759> lighter<00:05:38.060> more<00:05:38.689> poppy<00:05:39.199> melodic<00:05:39.800> song<00:05:40.009> and<00:05:40.279> it

00:05:40.929 --> 00:05:40.939 
a lighter more poppy melodic song and it

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:42.610 
a lighter more poppy melodic song and it
would<00:05:41.300> have<00:05:41.389> worked<00:05:41.870> me<00:05:42.110> better<00:05:42.379> on<00:05:42.529> their

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
would have worked me better on their

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.129 
would have worked me better on their
last<00:05:42.889> album<00:05:43.210> now<00:05:44.210> like<00:05:44.509> I<00:05:44.629> said<00:05:44.839> they<00:05:44.960> have

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:45.139 
last album now like I said they have

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:46.570

maybe with that album it might end up

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:52.659 
maybe with that album it might end up
