me two kills in the whole game awesome
huh<00:00:27.199> but<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.769> know<00:00:29.580> free<00:00:29.910> for<00:00:30.119> all<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.420> get<00:00:30.539> you

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
huh but I know free for all you get you

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.680 
huh but I know free for all you get you
know<00:00:31.199> gay<00:00:31.500> spawns<00:00:31.890> so<00:00:32.460> i<00:00:32.759> figured<00:00:33.480> i'm<00:00:33.570> going

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
know gay spawns so i figured i'm going

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.010 
know gay spawns so i figured i'm going
to<00:00:33.780> plant<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.200> Claymore<00:00:34.649> right<00:00:35.010> in<00:00:35.100> front<00:00:35.370> and

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
to plant the Claymore right in front and

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.010 
to plant the Claymore right in front and
work<00:00:37.020> backwards<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:37.950> way<00:00:38.010> i<00:00:38.510> can<00:00:39.510> cut<00:00:39.989> off

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
work backwards that way i can cut off

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.680 
work backwards that way i can cut off
the<00:00:40.110> spawn<00:00:40.590> if<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.640> guy<00:00:41.700> spot<00:00:42.270> in<00:00:42.360> front<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.600> me

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
the spawn if a guy spot in front of me

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.260 
the spawn if a guy spot in front of me
and<00:00:42.840> i<00:00:42.960> can<00:00:43.140> look<00:00:43.410> for<00:00:43.649> this<00:00:43.800> fall<00:00:44.010> but<00:00:44.910> it

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
and i can look for this fall but it

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.060 
and i can look for this fall but it
doesn't<00:00:45.690> matter<00:00:45.750> because<00:00:46.020> no<00:00:46.649> one's<00:00:46.800> bonds

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
doesn't matter because no one's bonds

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.959 
doesn't matter because no one's bonds
that<00:00:47.160> way<00:00:47.780> anyways<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.140> FAL<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.910> very<00:00:50.910> good

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
that way anyways the FAL is a very good

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.779 
that way anyways the FAL is a very good
gun<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.719> takes<00:00:51.930> two<00:00:52.230> sometimes<00:00:53.219> three<00:00:53.309> bullets

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
gun it takes two sometimes three bullets

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.360 
gun it takes two sometimes three bullets
to<00:00:54.000> kill<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.480> person<00:00:54.680> which<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:55.890> don't<00:00:56.010> know<00:00:56.250> if

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
to kill a person which I don't know if

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.779 
to kill a person which I don't know if
anyone<00:00:56.879> else<00:00:57.079> realizes<00:00:58.079> but<00:00:58.469> that's<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.890> really

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
anyone else realizes but that's a really

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.670 
anyone else realizes but that's a really
good<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:01.129> medium-range<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.910> will<00:01:03.500> you<00:01:04.500> can

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
good and medium-range you will you can

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.100 
good and medium-range you will you can
actually<00:01:04.830> do<00:01:05.040> work<00:01:05.189> if<00:01:05.369> you're<00:01:05.460> accurate

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
actually do work if you're accurate

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.810 
actually do work if you're accurate
using<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.170> holographic<00:01:07.590> sight<00:01:08.010> because<00:01:08.340> it

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
using the holographic sight because it

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.990 
using the holographic sight because it
like<00:01:09.380> if<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.470> look<00:01:10.830> at<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.520> holographic

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
like if you look at that the holographic

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.910 
like if you look at that the holographic
sight<00:01:12.299> has<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.720> little<00:01:13.200> down<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.590> middle<00:01:13.770> and

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
sight has the little down the middle and

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.130 
sight has the little down the middle and
then<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.159> has<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.460> little<00:01:14.640> tiny<00:01:15.630> circle

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
then it has that little tiny circle

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.130 
then it has that little tiny circle
around<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.460> feel<00:01:17.640> like<00:01:17.820> it's<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.869> little

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
around it and I feel like it's a little

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.770 
around it and I feel like it's a little
bit<00:01:19.229> bigger<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.820> sight<00:01:21.119> which<00:01:21.570> will

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
bit bigger of a of a sight which will

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.880 
bit bigger of a of a sight which will
lead<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.320> more<00:01:23.000> hit<00:01:24.000> detection<00:01:24.650> not<00:01:25.650> really

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
lead to more hit detection not really

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.819 
lead to more hit detection not really
sure<00:01:26.100> but<00:01:26.430> that's<00:01:26.850> just<00:01:27.030> how<00:01:27.180> i<00:01:27.210> feel<00:01:27.330> and

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
sure but that's just how i feel and

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:33.050 
sure but that's just how i feel and
using<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.950> fail<00:01:29.159> or<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.939> famas<00:01:31.700> with<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.880> with

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
using a fail or the famas with it with

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.270 
using a fail or the famas with it with
the<00:01:33.090> holographic<00:01:33.630> sight<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.290> seems<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:35.159> give

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
the holographic sight it seems to give

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.429 
the holographic sight it seems to give
me<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.400> little<00:01:35.549> more<00:01:35.670> hit<00:01:35.970> registration<00:01:36.570> so

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
me a little more hit registration so

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.890 
me a little more hit registration so
that's<00:01:37.650> why<00:01:37.770> using

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.930 

FAL<00:01:41.900> is<00:01:41.960> actually<00:01:42.230> really<00:01:42.320> good<00:01:42.410> gun<00:01:42.940> people

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
FAL is actually really good gun people

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.550 
FAL is actually really good gun people
need<00:01:44.120> to<00:01:44.270> try<00:01:44.780> it<00:01:44.840> out<00:01:44.930> a<00:01:44.990> little<00:01:45.140> more<00:01:45.290> you

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
need to try it out a little more you

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.030 
need to try it out a little more you
don't<00:01:45.710> need<00:01:45.800> a<00:01:45.860> mod<00:01:46.180> I<00:01:47.180> hope<00:01:47.630> you<00:01:48.170> guys<00:01:48.320> can<00:01:48.830> see

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
don't need a mod I hope you guys can see

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.010 
don't need a mod I hope you guys can see
that<00:01:49.190> from<00:01:49.280> this<00:01:49.430> game<00:01:49.640> you<00:01:50.300> don't<00:01:50.600> need<00:01:50.720> a<00:01:50.780> mod

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
that from this game you don't need a mod

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.070 
that from this game you don't need a mod
for<00:01:51.260> the<00:01:51.500> FAL<00:01:52.420> you're<00:01:53.420> not<00:01:53.540> really<00:01:53.750> that

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
for the FAL you're not really that

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.820 
for the FAL you're not really that
outmatched<00:01:54.740> with<00:01:55.400> from<00:01:55.850> other<00:01:56.830> assault

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
outmatched with from other assault

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.800 
outmatched with from other assault
rifles<00:01:57.890> as<00:01:58.400> long<00:01:58.880> as<00:01:59.000> you're<00:01:59.120> playing<00:01:59.270> smart

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
rifles as long as you're playing smart

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.570 
rifles as long as you're playing smart
with<00:01:59.960> it<00:02:00.110> like<00:02:00.770> you're<00:02:00.920> going<00:02:01.070> to<00:02:01.130> see<00:02:01.250> me<00:02:01.370> play

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
with it like you're going to see me play

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.000 
with it like you're going to see me play
a<00:02:01.640> little<00:02:01.730> smarter<00:02:02.270> than<00:02:02.390> this<00:02:02.980> then<00:02:03.980> I

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
a little smarter than this then I

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.080 
a little smarter than this then I
usually<00:02:04.250> would<00:02:04.580> I'm<00:02:04.730> not<00:02:07.090> consistently

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
usually would I'm not consistently

this<00:02:48.709> one<00:02:49.010> I'm<00:02:49.489> really<00:02:50.300> interested<00:02:50.630> in<00:02:51.020> using

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.620 
this one I'm really interested in using
the<00:02:51.790> ak-47<00:02:52.790> and<00:02:53.080> in<00:02:54.080> this<00:02:54.200> game<00:02:54.410> it<00:02:54.560> takes<00:02:54.770> two

the ak-47 and in this game it takes two
and<00:02:56.630> I<00:02:57.260> think<00:02:57.320> like<00:02:57.590> 2.1<00:02:58.489> million<00:02:58.820> experience

it get a few few games with the ak-47
and<00:03:26.810> then<00:03:27.820> and<00:03:28.820> then<00:03:28.970> continue<00:03:29.390> on<00:03:29.420> from<00:03:29.660> there

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
and then and then continue on from there

and then and then continue on from there
I<00:03:29.870> make<00:03:30.050> a<00:03:30.080> mistake<00:03:30.200> here<00:03:30.620> though<00:03:30.800> I<00:03:33.610> should

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
I make a mistake here though I should

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.230 
I make a mistake here though I should
have<00:03:34.670> kept<00:03:34.850> going<00:03:35.470> but<00:03:36.520> overall<00:03:37.520> very<00:03:37.790> easy

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.240 
have kept going but overall very easy

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.140 
have kept going but overall very easy
game<00:03:38.510> type<00:03:38.890> the<00:03:39.890> spawns<00:03:40.190> are<00:03:40.490> a<00:03:40.520> little<00:03:40.850> messed

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
game type the spawns are a little messed

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.150 
game type the spawns are a little messed
up<00:03:41.360> but<00:03:41.420> I<00:03:41.990> actually<00:03:42.140> like<00:03:42.560> them<00:03:42.740> in<00:03:42.860> the<00:03:43.010> on

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
up but I actually like them in the on

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.630 
up but I actually like them in the on
this<00:03:43.340> map<00:03:43.550> I<00:03:43.820> think<00:03:44.240> this<00:03:44.480> map<00:03:44.750> overall<00:03:45.290> for

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
this map I think this map overall for

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.070 
this map I think this map overall for
for<00:03:46.640> every<00:03:46.850> game<00:03:47.030> type<00:03:47.240> is<00:03:47.390> actually<00:03:47.690> really

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
for every game type is actually really

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.380 
for every game type is actually really
really<00:03:48.260> nice<00:03:48.680> it's<00:03:49.400> a<00:03:49.460> very<00:03:49.640> balanced<00:03:50.150> map

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
really nice it's a very balanced map

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.120 
really nice it's a very balanced map
from<00:03:51.670> from<00:03:52.670> search<00:03:52.910> and<00:03:52.970> destroy<00:03:53.240> to

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
from from search and destroy to

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.220 
from from search and destroy to
domination<00:03:55.130> to<00:03:55.730> free<00:03:56.540> for<00:03:56.720> all<00:03:56.780> I<00:03:56.930> mean<00:03:57.110> I

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
domination to free for all I mean I

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.160 
domination to free for all I mean I
think<00:03:57.260> this<00:03:57.590> is<00:03:57.740> a<00:03:57.800> very<00:03:57.950> balanced<00:03:58.370> map<00:03:58.580> and<00:03:59.170> I

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
think this is a very balanced map and I

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.020 
think this is a very balanced map and I
enjoy<00:04:00.830> playing<00:04:00.980> it's<00:04:01.160> not<00:04:01.340> quite<00:04:01.640> a<00:04:01.670> bit<00:04:01.880> I

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
enjoy playing it's not quite a bit I

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.220 
enjoy playing it's not quite a bit I
usually<00:04:02.360> do<00:04:02.480> well<00:04:02.660> and<00:04:03.080> I<00:04:03.710> know<00:04:04.510> Sam<00:04:05.510> 5,000

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
usually do well and I know Sam 5,000

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.620 
usually do well and I know Sam 5,000
actually<00:04:06.530> said<00:04:06.800> your<00:04:07.760> favorite<00:04:08.180> map<00:04:08.390> is

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
actually said your favorite map is

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.500 
actually said your favorite map is
usually<00:04:08.990> the<00:04:09.080> one<00:04:09.200> you<00:04:09.350> do<00:04:09.500> the<00:04:09.620> best<00:04:09.770> on<00:04:10.510> but

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
usually the one you do the best on but

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.290 
usually the one you do the best on but
for<00:04:12.050> me<00:04:12.170> this<00:04:12.380> map<00:04:12.620> I<00:04:12.800> do<00:04:12.890> well<00:04:13.220> but<00:04:13.580> I<00:04:13.850> don't

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
for me this map I do well but I don't

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.180 
for me this map I do well but I don't
play<00:04:14.900> it<00:04:15.050> too<00:04:15.200> often<00:04:15.380> I<00:04:15.680> think<00:04:15.890> that's<00:04:16.070> why

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
play it too often I think that's why

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390 
very minimal with the upgrades you can't

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
really upgrade a laptop i can add maybe

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.900 
really upgrade a laptop i can add maybe
another<00:05:07.910> gig<00:05:08.750> of<00:05:08.900> ram<00:05:09.130> if<00:05:10.130> my<00:05:10.430> mother<00:05:10.640> board

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
another gig of ram if my mother board

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.970 
another gig of ram if my mother board
will<00:05:11.090> support<00:05:11.480> it<00:05:11.630> but<00:05:11.900> i'm<00:05:12.650> not<00:05:12.919> really

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 
will support it but i'm not really

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.420 
will support it but i'm not really
entirely<00:05:13.430> sure<00:05:13.960> my<00:05:14.960> desktop<00:05:15.350> I<00:05:15.620> was<00:05:16.280> looking

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
entirely sure my desktop I was looking

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.530 
entirely sure my desktop I was looking
at<00:05:16.640> upgrading<00:05:16.880> that<00:05:17.300> but<00:05:17.930> i<00:05:18.910> think<00:05:19.910> my

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:20.540 
at upgrading that but i think my

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.490 
at upgrading that but i think my
processor<00:05:21.320> is<00:05:21.500> it's<00:05:21.770> a<00:05:21.980> an<00:05:22.730> old<00:05:22.970> 1i<00:05:23.480> have<00:05:24.470> a

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
processor is it's a an old 1i have a

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.650 
processor is it's a an old 1i have a
good<00:05:24.919> old<00:05:25.070> Lee<00:05:25.280> machines<00:05:25.730> from<00:05:26.240> back<00:05:26.450> in<00:05:26.480> the

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660 
good old Lee machines from back in the

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.590 
good old Lee machines from back in the
day<00:05:26.900> so<00:05:27.890> I<00:05:28.190> think<00:05:28.729> I'd<00:05:28.820> like<00:05:28.940> the<00:05:29.090> first<00:05:29.300> dual

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
day so I think I'd like the first dual

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.750 
day so I think I'd like the first dual
core<00:05:29.900> processor<00:05:29.930> on<00:05:30.710> the<00:05:30.740> on<00:05:31.100> the<00:05:31.160> he<00:05:31.400> machines

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
core processor on the on the he machines

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.110 
core processor on the on the he machines
that<00:05:32.000> they<00:05:32.120> came<00:05:32.270> out<00:05:32.450> with

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
that they came out with

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.810 
that they came out with
and<00:05:33.210> that<00:05:33.720> the<00:05:33.930> RAM<00:05:34.169> is<00:05:34.350> upgradable<00:05:34.949> to<00:05:34.979> two<00:05:35.340> it

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
and that the RAM is upgradable to two it

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.219 
and that the RAM is upgradable to two it
has<00:05:35.940> one<00:05:36.180> gig<00:05:36.360> of<00:05:36.540> ram<00:05:36.600> so<00:05:37.229> it's<00:05:37.410> awesome

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:39.229 
has one gig of ram so it's awesome

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:41.180 
has one gig of ram so it's awesome
everything<00:05:40.229> runs<00:05:40.410> really<00:05:40.620> slow<00:05:40.860> on<00:05:41.070> that

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
everything runs really slow on that

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.400 
everything runs really slow on that
thing<00:05:41.400> I<00:05:41.580> think<00:05:41.970> I<00:05:42.060> use<00:05:42.300> it<00:05:42.479> for<00:05:42.510> downloading

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410 
thing I think I use it for downloading

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:48.530 
thing I think I use it for downloading
music<00:05:43.500> and<00:05:44.750> that's<00:05:45.750> about<00:05:45.930> it<00:05:46.020> but<00:05:46.979> anyways<00:05:47.540> I

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540
