00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
think that dark road is just going to

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.710 
think that dark road is just going to
continue<00:03:24.800> to<00:03:25.220> be<00:03:25.370> a<00:03:25.400> novelty<00:03:25.940> deck<00:03:26.210> of<00:03:26.390> sorts

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
continue to be a novelty deck of sorts

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.000 
continue to be a novelty deck of sorts
you<00:03:26.960> know<00:03:27.080> I<00:03:27.110> don't<00:03:27.260> think<00:03:27.560> that<00:03:27.680> it's<00:03:27.800> going

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
you know I don't think that it's going

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.400 
you know I don't think that it's going
to<00:03:28.070> see<00:03:28.310> a<00:03:28.580> lot<00:03:28.970> of<00:03:29.210> high-level<00:03:29.570> play<00:03:30.020> because

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
to see a lot of high-level play because

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.590 
to see a lot of high-level play because
of<00:03:30.740> its<00:03:31.070> heavy<00:03:31.370> graveyard<00:03:31.970> dependency<00:03:32.570> and

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
of its heavy graveyard dependency and

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.830 
of its heavy graveyard dependency and
just<00:03:33.140> because<00:03:33.440> you<00:03:33.680> know<00:03:34.250> the<00:03:34.670> the<00:03:35.210> opening

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
just because you know the the opening

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.800 
just because you know the the opening
hands<00:03:36.230> are<00:03:36.380> just<00:03:36.440> it's<00:03:37.370> a<00:03:37.550> complete<00:03:38.180> mess<00:03:38.480> at

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
hands are just it's a complete mess at

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.270 
hands are just it's a complete mess at
times<00:03:39.110> a<00:03:39.380> lot<00:03:39.500> of<00:03:39.650> times<00:03:39.800> you<00:03:39.980> just<00:03:40.130> have

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
times a lot of times you just have

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.970 
times a lot of times you just have
inconsistency<00:03:41.090> problems<00:03:41.540> especially<00:03:42.230> after

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
inconsistency problems especially after

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.640 
inconsistency problems especially after
you<00:03:43.280> side<00:03:43.550> you<00:03:44.120> know<00:03:44.240> I<00:03:44.270> know<00:03:44.360> that<00:03:44.510> bad<00:03:45.350> hands

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
you side you know I know that bad hands

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.380 
you side you know I know that bad hands
can<00:03:45.890> be<00:03:46.010> a<00:03:46.040> part<00:03:46.310> of<00:03:46.400> any<00:03:46.610> deck<00:03:46.820> but<00:03:47.030> with<00:03:47.120> dark

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
can be a part of any deck but with dark

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.360 
can be a part of any deck but with dark
road<00:03:47.630> games<00:03:48.020> two<00:03:48.200> and<00:03:48.230> three<00:03:48.410> it's<00:03:48.830> just<00:03:49.160> I

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
road games two and three it's just I

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.340 
road games two and three it's just I
mean<00:03:49.790> it's<00:03:49.940> academic<00:03:50.600> like<00:03:50.810> you<00:03:51.110> can

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
mean it's academic like you can

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.020 
mean it's academic like you can
basically<00:03:51.560> take<00:03:51.830> that<00:03:52.160> to<00:03:52.280> the<00:03:52.310> bank<00:03:52.400> so<00:03:52.820> I

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
basically take that to the bank so I

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.660 
basically take that to the bank so I
think<00:03:53.660> that<00:03:53.900> if<00:03:54.110> velcro<00:03:54.470> was<00:03:54.620> an<00:03:54.770> NFL<00:03:55.130> team<00:03:55.160> it

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
think that if velcro was an NFL team it

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.250 
think that if velcro was an NFL team it
would<00:03:55.820> definitely<00:03:56.090> have<00:03:56.480> to<00:03:56.630> be<00:03:56.750> the<00:03:56.900> Detroit

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
would definitely have to be the Detroit

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.160 
would definitely have to be the Detroit
Lions<00:03:57.610> the<00:03:58.610> offense<00:03:59.120> looks<00:03:59.240> good<00:03:59.630> most<00:03:59.990> of<00:04:00.110> the

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
Lions the offense looks good most of the

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.660 
Lions the offense looks good most of the
time<00:04:00.230> but<00:04:00.620> that's<00:04:00.800> about<00:04:00.980> it<00:04:01.040> you<00:04:01.190> know<00:04:01.490> and

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
time but that's about it you know and

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.060 
time but that's about it you know and
you<00:04:02.150> can<00:04:02.300> never<00:04:02.510> trust<00:04:02.810> the<00:04:03.110> detroit<00:04:03.440> lions<00:04:03.470> or

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
you can never trust the detroit lions or

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.250 
you can never trust the detroit lions or
dark<00:04:04.370> world<00:04:04.550> to<00:04:04.880> ever<00:04:05.060> be<00:04:05.450> consistent<00:04:06.020> not

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
dark world to ever be consistent not

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.310 
dark world to ever be consistent not
ever<00:04:06.910> next<00:04:07.910> up<00:04:08.030> is<00:04:08.180> harpies<00:04:08.570> which<00:04:08.870> is<00:04:09.080> pretty

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
ever next up is harpies which is pretty

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.780 
ever next up is harpies which is pretty
much<00:04:09.440> the<00:04:09.590> exact<00:04:10.100> opposite<00:04:10.580> of<00:04:10.670> everything

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
much the exact opposite of everything

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.340 
much the exact opposite of everything
that<00:04:11.030> I<00:04:11.209> just<00:04:11.390> said<00:04:11.510> about<00:04:11.540> dark<00:04:11.930> world<00:04:12.110> I

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
that I just said about dark world I

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.290 
that I just said about dark world I
think<00:04:12.890> that<00:04:13.040> harpies<00:04:13.400> have<00:04:13.670> a<00:04:13.880> legitimate

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
think that harpies have a legitimate

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.360 
think that harpies have a legitimate
chance<00:04:14.480> to<00:04:14.990> be<00:04:15.110> the<00:04:15.230> best<00:04:15.410> at<00:04:15.650> this<00:04:15.800> format<00:04:16.220> I

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
chance to be the best at this format I

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.849 
chance to be the best at this format I
say<00:04:16.730> that<00:04:16.760> because<00:04:16.989> this<00:04:17.989> is<00:04:18.200> much<00:04:18.410> like<00:04:18.650> with

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
say that because this is much like with

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.820 
say that because this is much like with
TG<00:04:19.310> stud<00:04:19.640> was<00:04:19.880> good<00:04:20.180> it's<00:04:20.989> going<00:04:21.260> to<00:04:21.350> be<00:04:21.470> a<00:04:21.500> deck

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:21.830 
TG stud was good it's going to be a deck

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.250 
TG stud was good it's going to be a deck
where<00:04:22.100> the<00:04:22.130> sum<00:04:23.000> is<00:04:23.240> greater<00:04:23.360> than<00:04:23.810> all<00:04:23.990> of<00:04:24.140> the

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
where the sum is greater than all of the

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.140 
where the sum is greater than all of the
parts<00:04:24.590> you<00:04:25.100> look<00:04:25.250> at<00:04:25.340> the<00:04:25.460> deck<00:04:25.640> and<00:04:25.790> off

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
parts you look at the deck and off

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.730 
parts you look at the deck and off
to<00:04:26.330> bleed<00:04:26.509> solid<00:04:27.169> there<00:04:27.320> aren't<00:04:27.470> a<00:04:27.560> lot<00:04:27.590> of

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
to bleed solid there aren't a lot of

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.469 
to bleed solid there aren't a lot of
beetles<00:04:28.220> in<00:04:28.370> the<00:04:28.460> deck<00:04:28.639> but<00:04:28.850> it<00:04:28.970> doesn't

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 
beetles in the deck but it doesn't

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:31.540 
beetles in the deck but it doesn't
really<00:04:29.570> matter<00:04:29.750> because<00:04:29.990> every<00:04:30.830> monster<00:04:31.190> kind

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
really matter because every monster kind

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.879 
really matter because every monster kind
of<00:04:31.669> serves<00:04:31.880> a<00:04:32.030> purpose<00:04:32.210> you<00:04:32.540> know<00:04:32.620> Chandler<00:04:33.620> is

of both you know what I really like
about<00:04:40.280> the<00:04:40.639> deck<00:04:40.850> is<00:04:41.090> the<00:04:41.389> ability<00:04:41.660> to<00:04:41.960> keep

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
about the deck is the ability to keep

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:44.170 
about the deck is the ability to keep

that I'm biased towards Icarus attack

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.680 
that I'm biased towards Icarus attack
but<00:04:59.780> the<00:05:00.289> card<00:05:00.650> is<00:05:00.949> fucking<00:05:01.460> real<00:05:01.850> you<00:05:02.600> know

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
but the card is fucking real you know

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.270 
but the card is fucking real you know
and<00:05:02.900> the<00:05:02.990> same<00:05:03.229> could<00:05:03.470> be<00:05:03.500> said<00:05:03.590> for<00:05:03.830> a<00:05:04.100> card

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
and the same could be said for a card

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.189 
and the same could be said for a card
like<00:05:04.400> Felix<00:05:04.789> with<00:05:04.910> web<00:05:05.060> blast<00:05:05.360> you<00:05:05.930> know<00:05:06.050> they

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:06.199 
like Felix with web blast you know they

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:08.800 
like Felix with web blast you know they
handle<00:05:06.650> a<00:05:06.800> wide<00:05:07.100> amount<00:05:07.580> of<00:05:07.699> problems<00:05:08.210> they

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
handle a wide amount of problems they

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.320 
handle a wide amount of problems they
work<00:05:09.080> against<00:05:09.800> pretty<00:05:10.340> much<00:05:10.520> anything<00:05:11.030> your

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
work against pretty much anything your

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:12.640 
work against pretty much anything your
opponent's<00:05:11.720> going<00:05:11.870> to<00:05:11.930> throw<00:05:12.080> at<00:05:12.229> you<00:05:12.410> and

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 
they work with a bunch of different

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:16.360 
they work with a bunch of different
cards<00:05:14.780> in<00:05:14.870> the<00:05:14.960> deck<00:05:14.990> so<00:05:15.410> you<00:05:15.949> don't<00:05:16.100> have<00:05:16.220> to

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
cards in the deck so you don't have to

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.339 
cards in the deck so you don't have to
worry<00:05:16.550> about<00:05:16.639> the<00:05:16.910> big<00:05:17.150> potentially<00:05:17.810> dead<00:05:18.080> at

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:18.349 
worry about the big potentially dead at

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:22.240 
worry about the big potentially dead at
any<00:05:18.500> time<00:05:18.830> I<00:05:19.190> like<00:05:20.000> that<00:05:20.419> harpies<00:05:20.900> are<00:05:21.229> a<00:05:21.740> deck

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
any time I like that harpies are a deck

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.240 
any time I like that harpies are a deck
where<00:05:22.490> they<00:05:22.760> get<00:05:22.940> a<00:05:22.970> lot<00:05:23.360> out<00:05:23.599> of<00:05:23.660> a<00:05:23.840> little

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
where they get a lot out of a little

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:30.039 
where they get a lot out of a little
