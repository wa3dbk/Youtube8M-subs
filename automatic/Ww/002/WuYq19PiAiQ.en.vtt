 is fixed 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:36.639
 and agreed 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:39.940
 Laws Percent I execute so it is one

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:08.319
 therapists 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:09.319
 the band itself 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:14.089
 equipped with the exchange of experience with international experts 

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:17.529
 about from the quarrel revolves around 2 points 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.720
 Reichenbach and I have always good for each other 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.020
 continue 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.509
 especially in the art education of students 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:32.360
 and to fix them working with children behind them I only briefly 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:36.600
 continue the partners 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.040
 which books about in research and therapeutic practice and 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.040
 Training these books were spread all over the world 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:45.879
 not translated 

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:47.770
 the psychomotor 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.069
 that's something new with me again 

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:53.419
 come from Iran 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:56.169
 but who read bad 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:58.520
 both the problems 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.529
 Theory and practice changes only through that he gives know 

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:03.500
 funny saying theory is 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.430
 now everything does not work out 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.919
 and practice is for artists no way Euro but with us always like that 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:13.839
 Percent we have to go against the normal evil 

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:16.839
 the normal procedure the first pure theory 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:21.550
 is made and then this theory is tried on the practice 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.460
 we had a practice the kids were at the door we needed something 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:30.470
 we were challenged and as this practice was the first thing that was there and 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:34.770
 then you later tried to justify that theoretically so that's it 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:35.840
 a reverse one 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.949
 Process and theory also still do not fit 

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:39.800
