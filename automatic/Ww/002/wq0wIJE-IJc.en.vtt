00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.830 
pull this and it falls right in and the
spring<00:01:50.070> locks<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.610> in<00:01:50.729> place<00:01:50.759> with<00:01:51.600> those

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
spring locks it in place with those

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.440 
spring locks it in place with those
little<00:01:52.049> notches<00:01:52.380> up<00:01:52.740> here<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.850> then<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.180> sits

on you Tom stand which is not choking
the<00:02:01.560> drum<00:02:01.799> shell<00:02:02.070> yeah<00:02:02.700> this<00:02:03.479> is<00:02:03.600> about<00:02:03.810> this

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
the drum shell yeah this is about this

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.080 
the drum shell yeah this is about this
then<00:02:04.259> it's<00:02:04.619> half<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.040> weight<00:02:05.219> in<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.520> compared

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
then it's half the weight in a compared

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.960 
then it's half the weight in a compared
to<00:02:06.149> our<00:02:06.270> regular<00:02:07.020> 6000<00:02:07.590> stand<00:02:07.829> same<00:02:08.729> with<00:02:08.879> the

what<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.510> noticed<00:02:15.840> right<00:02:15.930> away<00:02:15.990> looking<00:02:16.470> at<00:02:16.650> it

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
what I noticed right away looking at it

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.250 
what I noticed right away looking at it
is<00:02:17.010> even<00:02:17.370> though<00:02:17.550> it<00:02:17.760> is<00:02:17.900> lightweight<00:02:18.900> looking

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
is even though it is lightweight looking

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.710 
is even though it is lightweight looking
it<00:02:19.350> looks<00:02:19.380> really<00:02:20.040> durable<00:02:20.460> which<00:02:20.760> was<00:02:21.570> not

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
it looks really durable which was not

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.900 
it looks really durable which was not
the<00:02:21.900> case<00:02:21.930> in<00:02:22.470> lighter<00:02:22.830> hardware<00:02:23.490> in<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.670> past

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
the case in lighter hardware in the past

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.460 
the case in lighter hardware in the past
I<00:02:24.060> mean<00:02:24.180> this<00:02:24.360> snare<00:02:24.630> stand<00:02:24.810> especially<00:02:25.380> when

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
I mean this snare stand especially when

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.290 
I mean this snare stand especially when
I<00:02:25.500> saw<00:02:25.770> it<00:02:25.800> I<00:02:26.070> could<00:02:26.400> see<00:02:26.580> right<00:02:26.610> away<00:02:26.970> how

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
I saw it I could see right away how

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.490 
I saw it I could see right away how
putting<00:02:27.630> a<00:02:27.690> snare<00:02:27.900> on<00:02:27.930> us<00:02:28.080> I<00:02:28.200> wouldn't<00:02:28.410> be

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
putting a snare on us I wouldn't be

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.440 
putting a snare on us I wouldn't be
afraid<00:02:28.740> about<00:02:28.950> it<00:02:29.250> it's<00:02:29.820> going<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.030> hold<00:02:30.240> up

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
afraid about it it's going to hold up

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.030 
afraid about it it's going to hold up
which<00:02:30.720> i<00:02:30.870> think<00:02:30.930> is<00:02:31.260> so<00:02:31.470> impressive<00:02:31.800> on<00:02:32.010> a

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
which i think is so impressive on a

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.610 
which i think is so impressive on a
simplest<00:02:32.580> excuse<00:02:33.060> me<00:02:33.180> a<00:02:33.210> hardware<00:02:34.080> line<00:02:34.410> like

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
simplest excuse me a hardware line like

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.170 
simplest excuse me a hardware line like
this<00:02:34.800> is<00:02:34.980> meant<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.340> be<00:02:35.370> ultra<00:02:35.880> light<00:02:36.030> and
