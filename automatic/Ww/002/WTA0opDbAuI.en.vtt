another Ice Cube this time there's a
bunch<00:03:28.430> of<00:03:28.670> ice<00:03:29.359> crystals<00:03:29.840> that<00:03:30.319> will<00:03:30.470> be<00:03:30.590> a

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
bunch of ice crystals that will be a

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.309 
bunch of ice crystals that will be a
chasing<00:03:31.220> year-round<00:03:31.459> so<00:03:32.359> just<00:03:32.630> a<00:03:32.750> roll<00:03:33.019> and

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
chasing year-round so just a roll and

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:36.640 
chasing year-round so just a roll and
avoid<00:03:33.560> them<00:03:33.920> when<00:03:34.280> they<00:03:34.430> crash<00:03:35.260> you<00:03:36.260> see<00:03:36.560> them

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
avoid them when they crash you see them

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.470

and<00:03:36.920> the<00:03:37.069> reflection<00:03:37.640> on<00:03:37.730> the<00:03:37.760> ice<00:03:37.970> below<00:03:38.269> you

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
and the reflection on the ice below you

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.319 
and the reflection on the ice below you
and<00:03:38.980> once<00:03:39.980> they<00:03:40.160> stop<00:03:40.489> just<00:03:40.819> kind<00:03:40.970> of<00:03:41.030> smack

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
and once they stop just kind of smack

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:42.699 
and once they stop just kind of smack

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
them with the ball and chain to get rid

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.059 
them with the ball and chain to get rid
of<00:03:42.739> some<00:03:43.040> of<00:03:43.069> them

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.149 

and<00:03:46.420> this<00:03:47.420> process<00:03:47.689> is<00:03:48.079> going<00:03:48.260> to<00:03:48.409> repeat<00:03:48.890> for

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:49.159 
and this process is going to repeat for

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:52.509 
and this process is going to repeat for
a<00:03:49.189> while<00:03:50.079> of<00:03:51.079> me<00:03:51.379> just<00:03:51.620> running<00:03:51.920> around<00:03:52.010> and

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
a while of me just running around and

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.670 
a while of me just running around and
what<00:03:53.239> you're<00:03:53.389> trying<00:03:53.510> to<00:03:53.689> do<00:03:53.840> is<00:03:54.049> knock<00:03:54.349> away

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
what you're trying to do is knock away

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.910 
what you're trying to do is knock away
the<00:03:54.969> ice<00:03:55.969> crystals<00:03:56.599> which<00:03:56.810> are<00:03:57.260> forming<00:03:57.739> a

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
the ice crystals which are forming a

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.559 
the ice crystals which are forming a
circular<00:03:58.310> barrier<00:03:58.939> around

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
circular barrier around

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:05.830 
circular barrier around
Yetta<00:04:00.170> so<00:04:01.719> this<00:04:02.719> match<00:04:03.200> with<00:04:03.409> that<00:04:03.670> and<00:04:04.840> they

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
Yetta so this match with that and they

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:15.879 
Yetta so this match with that and they
also<00:04:06.019> drop<00:04:06.379> heart<00:04:06.709> pieces<00:04:06.980> conveniently<00:04:14.889> and

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
also drop heart pieces conveniently and

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:20.439 
also drop heart pieces conveniently and
I<00:04:16.070> get<00:04:16.280> off<00:04:16.430> sit<00:04:16.940> on<00:04:17.060> her<00:04:17.299> there<00:04:17.599> I<00:04:17.630> believe<00:04:19.449> and

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:20.449 
I get off sit on her there I believe and

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:25.150 
I get off sit on her there I believe and
it's<00:04:21.139> just<00:04:21.289> gonna<00:04:21.440> repeat<00:04:22.539> yeah<00:04:24.130> yeah<00:04:25.130> I

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160
