00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.330 
there but it breaks up by um by some
turn-based<00:01:51.270> combat<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.799> is<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.009> little<00:01:53.189> bit

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
turn-based combat so it is a little bit

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.160 
turn-based combat so it is a little bit
uncoordinated<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.360> goofy<00:01:54.720> at<00:01:54.810> times<00:01:55.020> it

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
uncoordinated and goofy at times it

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.149 
uncoordinated and goofy at times it
doesn't<00:01:55.320> hit<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.590> right<00:01:55.710> notes

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
doesn't hit the right notes

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.429 
doesn't hit the right notes
yeah<00:01:56.340> but<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.360> foundations<00:01:57.930> are<00:01:58.049> there<00:01:58.200> and

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
yeah but the foundations are there and

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.770 
yeah but the foundations are there and
they're<00:01:58.890> fantastic<00:01:59.070> like<00:01:59.759> there<00:02:00.509> are<00:02:00.600> some

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
they're fantastic like there are some

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.209 
they're fantastic like there are some
things<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.380> does<00:02:01.530> differently<00:02:01.979> that

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
things that it does differently that

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.459 
things that it does differently that
other<00:02:02.399> visual<00:02:02.759> novels<00:02:03.060> don't<00:02:03.240> do<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:04.290> does

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
other visual novels don't do and it does

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.859 
other visual novels don't do and it does
it<00:02:05.100> does<00:02:05.280> cross<00:02:05.700> some<00:02:05.909> boundaries<00:02:06.329> that<00:02:06.719> other

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
it does cross some boundaries that other

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.749 
it does cross some boundaries that other
players<00:02:07.110> on<00:02:07.469> other<00:02:07.619> games<00:02:07.770> don't<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.429> I<00:02:08.580> like

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
players on other games don't and I like

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:09.740 
players on other games don't and I like
that<00:02:08.940> it's<00:02:09.090> fantastic

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
that it's fantastic

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.630 
that it's fantastic
it's<00:02:10.020> ambitious<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.649> it's<00:02:11.099> definitely<00:02:11.489> worth

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
it's ambitious and it's definitely worth

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.940 
it's ambitious and it's definitely worth
a<00:02:11.760> try
