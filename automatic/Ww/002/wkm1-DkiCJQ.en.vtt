00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.710
 I understand youtube media I hope that 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.149
 be of the best today and good 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.179
 Well, the time has passed since I went up 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:13.179
 my last video on how to improve the 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:15.440
 vector thinking leave in the description 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:16.790
 for new subscribers who do not 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.649
 have seen that probably all already 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.650
 they must have seen it because it was my 

00:00:18.649 --> 00:00:23.289
 most recent video 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.880
 Well, if I'm not going to waste a lot of time 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.029
 saying why I was not going up 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.560
 videos because the truth is that for 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.029
 what for what to waste time what yes 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.870
 it surprises me is the amount of people 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.379
 they ask me 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.879
 by facebook or by xbox or by youtube me 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:39.890
 they ask why I do not upload videos and 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.050
 The truth is that I realize that a 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.649
 many people really in truth in 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.210
 You really like my videos, I think 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.550
 which are videos as well as simple but 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.589
 it seems that you really value them 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.440
 much and good that, because the truth is that 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:57.409
 It makes me happy and it's very good and it motivates me 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.210
 to continue uploading videos that's why 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:01.339
 coming out this video that is titled how 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.579
 play or how to be better at free for 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:05.770
 all against all 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.320
 and then practically for any type 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.990
 of broth and you can serve you are going to 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.520
 serve these tips good advice 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.219
 number one 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.630
 just stay in a place where I 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:19.149
 I mean with this you are not moving 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.310
 so much you are not moving around the 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.649
 map as you should generally 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.380
 do in other types of game this goes on 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:29.469
 against what I say against me 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.329
 mode of my game style but if 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:33.159
 you're just not moving so much 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:35.439
 just stay in one place for 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.360
 example here I would stay in my place 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:40.689
 of appearances I answer I stayed 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.659
 here and then towers of all appeared to me 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:46.510
 very close to my time the truth then 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:49.600
 this there is no need to move 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.730
 if we continue to feel advice use 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.570
 silencer the muffler is vital in 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:58.290
 all against all you do not want all 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.880
 they come to you like a swarm and then you 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.620
 kill fast truth because what you want 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.540
 is to be alive to be able to kill and 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.550
 kill and kill and why and for what point 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.190
 go up faster because free for al no 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.470
 you can not change because you're going to 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.910
 win those that are moving me by 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.650
 example I was very active responds 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.130
 I was seeing who was approaching whom 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.630
 did not approach and if you have 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.850
 silenced the truth is that it is very good 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.650
 because you are hunting them inside your 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.130
 own area that in this case was my 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.800
 place of appearance and then if you feel 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.890
 advice use low gusts the gusts 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.520
 casualties are vital in all against all 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.290
 because there are no objectives that help you 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.930
 get points easier as it is in 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.550
 domination here to capture a flag and 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.520
 he tells you as if they had killed two 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.350
 people 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.240
 and then in all against all simply 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:53.030
 they give you I think 100 points for each drop 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.280
 and then you can not use high gusts 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:00.250
 and then if that would be the advice I would 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:02.740
 example brought web and brought against 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.320
 and it brought the centric ones / it's very good 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.210
 I like it a lot because I just leave it 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.840
 in one place and I'm going to cover the other 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:12.100
 side of my own area that as I said 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.860
 it's the rhythm 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.090
 for example I put my in wheat on the side 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.220
 left and I'm going to cover the 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.950
 right and between the two then we do 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:24.700
 claws to the opposites 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.860
 and then yes friends those would be the three 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.709
 vital points that I always take in 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.000
 tell how I'm playing all against 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.220
 everyone 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.170
 and then, friends, the gameplay is already 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.420
 end unfortunately it is very 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.010
 sad I know, I know, but I'll go 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.080
 to upload another video soon I will not be 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.540
 absent so long 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.520
 like the last time and before saying goodbye 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.850
 I want to ask you what advice 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.800
 They want me to come up for example 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:54.520
 can you ask me how to get a title 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:57.310
 or how do I do not know profession more effective 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.260
 or easier or how to get more streaks 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.110
 I think it high up a video but not 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.940
 I know how something better explained or is that 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:07.300
 is the point of the idea that you 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:10.090
 say they want what advice they want 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.100
 that I tell you about Carlos de 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.350
 whites 2 a short or any other call 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.960
 of duty 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.610
 and then yes let us in the comments I 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.500
 I'll take it into account I read all the 

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:24.180
 whether comments seriously believe me 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.410
