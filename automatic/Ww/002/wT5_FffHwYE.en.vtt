00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
basically what what their averages are

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.850 
basically what what their averages are
is<00:00:45.270> when<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.719> thrifty<00:00:46.110> plan<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.469> about<00:00:46.680> five

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
is when the thrifty plan is about five

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.500 
is when the thrifty plan is about five
dollars<00:00:47.070> on<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.489> low<00:00:47.610> cost<00:00:47.789> plan<00:00:48.090> about<00:00:48.270> six

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
dollars on the low cost plan about six

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.180 
dollars on the low cost plan about six
dollars<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.260> moderate<00:00:49.649> plan<00:00:49.860> about<00:00:50.010> eight

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
dollars the moderate plan about eight

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.100 
dollars the moderate plan about eight
dollars<00:00:50.550> I'd<00:00:50.969> own<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.120> more<00:00:51.329> liberal<00:00:51.600> type<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:52.020> a

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
dollars I'd own a more liberal type of a

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.720 
dollars I'd own a more liberal type of a
food<00:00:52.289> plan<00:00:52.500> their<00:00:52.920> spending<00:00:53.100> about<00:00:53.340> ten

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
food plan their spending about ten

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.470 
food plan their spending about ten
dollars<00:00:53.910> per<00:00:54.809> person<00:00:55.289> per<00:00:55.680> day<00:00:56.000> so<00:00:57.000> that's<00:00:57.270> the

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
dollars per person per day so that's the

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.610 
dollars per person per day so that's the
idea<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.840> what<00:00:57.989> an<00:00:58.109> average<00:00:58.230> person's

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
idea of what an average person's

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.099 
idea of what an average person's
currently<00:00:59.160> spends<00:00:59.460> now<00:00:59.789> sort<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.510> walk<00:01:00.930> me

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
currently spends now sort of walk me

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.360 
currently spends now sort of walk me
through<00:01:01.289> how<00:01:01.320> much<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.800> would<00:01:01.890> translate<00:01:02.250> to

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
through how much that would translate to

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.219 
through how much that would translate to
if<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.969> reduce<00:01:03.120> them<00:01:03.329> like<00:01:03.539> daily<00:01:03.840> bread<00:01:04.049> which

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
if I reduce them like daily bread which

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.810 
if I reduce them like daily bread which
it<00:01:04.379> gives<00:01:04.739> me<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:04.920> meals<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.400> need<00:01:05.670> in

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
it gives me the meals that I need in

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.950 
it gives me the meals that I need in
some<00:01:05.939> kind<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.150> emergency<00:01:06.360> how<00:01:06.750> does<00:01:06.869> that

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
some kind of emergency how does that

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.230 
some kind of emergency how does that
compare<00:01:07.189> exactly<00:01:08.189> what<00:01:08.580> we've<00:01:08.729> done<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:09.030> we

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
compare exactly what we've done is we

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.670 
compare exactly what we've done is we
have<00:01:09.270> our<00:01:09.720> goal<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:09.990> daily<00:01:10.200> bread<00:01:10.380> was<00:01:10.560> to

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
have our goal of daily bread was to

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.920 
have our goal of daily bread was to
provide<00:01:10.950> food<00:01:11.280> storage<00:01:11.939> for<00:01:12.210> families<00:01:12.630> that's

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
provide food storage for families that's

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.750 
provide food storage for families that's
significantly<00:01:13.500> less<00:01:13.650> expensive<00:01:14.189> than<00:01:14.340> what

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
significantly less expensive than what

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.219 
significantly less expensive than what
they're<00:01:14.909> currently<00:01:15.090> spending<00:01:15.630> on<00:01:15.840> their<00:01:16.020> food

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
so for example we have a couple

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.280 
so for example we have a couple
different<00:01:17.850> options<00:01:18.060> we<00:01:18.420> have<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.630> tu<00:01:18.930> mila<00:01:19.080> de

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
different options we have a tu mila de

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.660 
different options we have a tu mila de

cost-conscious<00:01:34.229> this<00:01:34.860> for<00:01:35.070> example<00:01:35.340> would<00:01:35.820> be

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
cost-conscious this for example would be

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.880 
cost-conscious this for example would be
the<00:01:36.180> equivalent<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.570> like<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.900> two-day<00:01:37.200> to

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
the equivalent of like the two-day to

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.469 
the equivalent of like the two-day to
meal<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.100> day<00:01:38.250> thing<00:01:38.670> exactly<00:01:39.240> let's<00:01:39.299> take<00:01:39.450> a

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
meal a day thing exactly let's take a

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.999 
meal a day thing exactly let's take a
look<00:01:39.659> here<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:40.200> what<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.380> have<00:01:40.560> here<00:01:40.590> would<00:01:40.979> be

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
look here so what I have here would be

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.760 
look here so what I have here would be
the<00:01:41.520> oatmeal<00:01:41.850> for<00:01:42.689> breakfast<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.320> then<00:01:43.380> our

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
the oatmeal for breakfast and then our

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.440 
the oatmeal for breakfast and then our
chicken<00:01:44.040> ala<00:01:44.130> king<00:01:44.250> for<00:01:44.549> dinner<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.909> also<00:01:45.270> put

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
chicken ala king for dinner I also put

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.850 
chicken ala king for dinner I also put
some<00:01:45.570> white<00:01:45.720> milk<00:01:45.960> in<00:01:46.110> there<00:01:46.259> just<00:01:46.380> along<00:01:46.680> with

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
some white milk in there just along with

some white milk in there just along with
your<00:01:47.009> breakfast<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:47.729> this<00:01:47.850> would<00:01:48.000> be<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.119> really

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
your breakfast so this would be a really

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.330 
your breakfast so this would be a really
good<00:01:48.540> example<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.049> tu<00:01:49.229> mila<00:01:49.380> de<00:01:49.590> package<00:01:49.950> and

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
good example of a tu mila de package and

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.319 
good example of a tu mila de package and

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
then this would be more of a little

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.490 
then this would be more of a little
along<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.659> lines<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:51.990> three<00:01:52.170> male<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.409> a

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
package race so what could someone

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.679 
package race so what could someone
expect<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.000> three<00:01:54.180> meal<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.360> tailback

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689
