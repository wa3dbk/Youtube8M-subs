Katz welcome back to music education for

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.400 
Katz welcome back to music education for
all<00:00:04.650> and<00:00:04.980> today<00:00:05.400> we<00:00:05.819> are<00:00:05.970> gonna<00:00:06.810> take<00:00:07.109> a<00:00:07.170> look

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
all and today we are gonna take a look

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.560 
all and today we are gonna take a look
at<00:00:07.620> this<00:00:08.610> etude<00:00:09.510> that<00:00:09.929> I<00:00:09.960> wrote<00:00:10.230> out<00:00:10.429> this

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:11.570 
at this etude that I wrote out this

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.010 
at this etude that I wrote out this
works<00:00:12.570> on<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:13.349> 12<00:00:13.860> major<00:00:14.309> triads<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.299> these

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
works on the 12 major triads and these

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.060 
works on the 12 major triads and these
are<00:00:16.199> all<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.590> kind<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:17.010> different

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
are all the kind of different

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.540 
are all the kind of different
permutations<00:00:17.550> of<00:00:18.390> them<00:00:20.869> being<00:00:22.550> first

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
permutations of them being first

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.439 
permutations of them being first
inversion<00:00:23.820> second<00:00:24.330> inversion<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:26.449> skipping

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
inversion second inversion and skipping

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.740 
inversion second inversion and skipping
steps<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.380> octaves<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.760> added<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.390> little

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
steps and octaves and I added a little

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.080 
steps and octaves and I added a little
bit<00:00:31.080> of<00:00:31.850> altissimo<00:00:32.989> range<00:00:33.989> notes<00:00:34.410> in<00:00:34.739> there

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
bit of altissimo range notes in there

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.630 
bit of altissimo range notes in there
and<00:00:36.090> if<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.809> can't<00:00:37.079> play<00:00:37.350> them<00:00:37.559> just<00:00:38.399> skip

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
and if you can't play them just skip

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.690 
and if you can't play them just skip
them<00:00:38.760> or<00:00:39.030> play<00:00:39.210> them<00:00:39.300> down<00:00:39.480> an<00:00:39.660> octave

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
them or play them down an octave

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.369 
them or play them down an octave
nobody<00:00:41.700> really<00:00:42.030> writes<00:00:42.300> up<00:00:42.540> there<00:00:42.750> anyway<00:00:43.140> and

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
nobody really writes up there anyway and

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.310 
nobody really writes up there anyway and
I<00:00:43.950> probably<00:00:44.190> should<00:00:44.700> have<00:00:44.910> written<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.420> just<00:00:46.170> a

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
I probably should have written it just a

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.850 
I probably should have written it just a
VA<00:00:46.710> an<00:00:47.610> octave<00:00:48.090> lower<00:00:48.260> which<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.410> could<00:00:49.620> read

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
VA an octave lower which you could read

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.610 
VA an octave lower which you could read
up<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.760> octave<00:00:51.149> but<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.600> any<00:00:51.750> case<00:00:51.930> it's<00:00:52.320> it's

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
up the octave but in any case it's it's

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.260 
up the octave but in any case it's it's
there<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.370> way<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.989> will<00:00:55.350> just

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
there is the way it is and I will just

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.729 
there is the way it is and I will just
play<00:00:57.270> through<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.780> just<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:58.109> little<00:00:58.350> bit<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:58.649> you

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
play through it just a little bit so you

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.510 
play through it just a little bit so you
can<00:00:58.879> hear<00:00:59.879> what<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.750> sounds<00:01:01.109> like<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.620> feel

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
can hear what it sounds like and feel

00:01:02.520 --> 00:02:17.250 
can hear what it sounds like and feel
free<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.760> try<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.090> so

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.890 

anyway<00:02:18.260> you<00:02:18.320> get<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.590> idea<00:02:18.740> so<00:02:19.600> this<00:02:20.600> would<00:02:20.780> be

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
anyway you get the idea so this would be

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.310 
anyway you get the idea so this would be
something<00:02:21.170> to<00:02:21.320> practice<00:02:21.560> I<00:02:22.720> know<00:02:23.720> I<00:02:23.870> sound

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
something to practice I know I sound

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.780 
something to practice I know I sound
like<00:02:24.470> a<00:02:24.590> broken<00:02:24.830> record<00:02:25.130> from<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:25.640> other

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
like a broken record from the other

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.660 
like a broken record from the other
videos<00:02:26.209> but<00:02:26.630> you<00:02:26.870> might<00:02:27.290> even<00:02:27.890> try<00:02:28.070> playing

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
videos but you might even try playing

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.670 
videos but you might even try playing
this<00:02:28.880> backwards<00:02:29.480> Oh<00:02:29.630> actually<00:02:29.990> I<00:02:30.290> know<00:02:30.440> what<00:02:30.650> I

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
this backwards Oh actually I know what I

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.890 
this backwards Oh actually I know what I
was<00:02:30.830> going<00:02:30.980> to<00:02:31.070> tell<00:02:31.220> you<00:02:31.430> you<00:02:32.390> could<00:02:32.600> change

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
was going to tell you you could change

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.610 
was going to tell you you could change
the<00:02:34.630> articulation<00:02:35.630> which<00:02:35.959> would<00:02:36.140> make<00:02:36.380> this

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
the articulation which would make this

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.270 
the articulation which would make this
thing<00:02:36.680> really<00:02:37.490> cool<00:02:38.230> and<00:02:39.230> and<00:02:39.650> different<00:02:40.100> and

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
thing really cool and and different and

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.460 
thing really cool and and different and
challenging<00:02:40.630> and<00:02:41.630> I'll<00:02:41.930> just<00:02:42.110> give<00:02:42.260> you<00:02:42.290> a

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
challenging and I'll just give you a

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.400 
challenging and I'll just give you a
couple<00:02:42.709> of<00:02:42.950> examples<00:02:43.370> just<00:02:43.880> say<00:02:44.360> like<00:02:47.410> you

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
couple of examples just say like you

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:55.110 
couple of examples just say like you
know<00:02:49.120> say<00:02:50.120> you<00:02:50.180> just

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.160 

you<00:02:55.720> could<00:02:56.970> tongue<00:02:57.970> all<00:02:58.269> these<00:02:58.540> things<00:02:58.840> you

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
you could tongue all these things you
