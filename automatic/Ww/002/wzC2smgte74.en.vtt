you<00:01:10.100> know<00:01:10.369> when<00:01:10.520> we're<00:01:10.670> looking<00:01:10.789> at<00:01:10.969> this

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
you know when we're looking at this

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.029 
you know when we're looking at this
video<00:01:11.329> the<00:01:11.420> most<00:01:11.600> remarkable<00:01:12.109> thing<00:01:12.320> to<00:01:12.350> me<00:01:12.619> is

00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:13.039 
video the most remarkable thing to me is

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:15.399 
video the most remarkable thing to me is
what<00:01:13.490> it<00:01:13.670> did<00:01:13.939> when<00:01:14.179> you<00:01:14.359> made<00:01:14.600> a<00:01:14.630> real<00:01:15.049> sharp

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
what it did when you made a real sharp

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.139 
what it did when you made a real sharp
turn<00:01:15.679> how<00:01:15.859> the<00:01:15.920> hitch<00:01:16.130> reacted<00:01:16.700> that's<00:01:16.939> right

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
turn how the hitch reacted that's right

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:19.029 
turn how the hitch reacted that's right
it<00:01:17.359> automatically<00:01:17.899> slides<00:01:18.289> back<00:01:18.530> so<00:01:18.710> it<00:01:18.829> knows

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:19.039 
it automatically slides back so it knows

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:20.649 
it automatically slides back so it knows
when<00:01:19.369> it<00:01:19.490> needs<00:01:19.670> more<00:01:19.909> clearance<00:01:20.359> it's

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
when it needs more clearance it's

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:21.730 
when it needs more clearance it's
automatic<00:01:21.109> you<00:01:21.200> don't<00:01:21.319> have<00:01:21.409> to<00:01:21.469> think<00:01:21.619> about

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
automatic you don't have to think about

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.230 
automatic you don't have to think about
it<00:01:21.979> yeah<00:01:22.189> and<00:01:22.369> if<00:01:22.429> we<00:01:22.520> creep<00:01:22.729> up<00:01:22.909> and<00:01:23.060> take<00:01:23.210> a

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
it yeah and if we creep up and take a

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.459
