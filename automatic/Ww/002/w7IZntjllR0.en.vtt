00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.830
 Hi everyone, even the squid problem stated 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.280
 and you must be wondering what kind of knowledge the auction 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:09.729
 Climbing football of champions 

00:00:09.729 --> 00:00:13.729
 let's give up what I believe the first three things are better 

00:00:13.729 --> 00:00:19.259
 footballer bark something very strong in common essential was not taken into account 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:22.509
 you can end up having a big headache 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:26.249
 but what matters is something that scares her that what that is that they have 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:27.369
 in common 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:29.909
 the strategy is 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:34.480
 they all need a lot of strategy if you want to succeed 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.800
 football, I'm going to jump because with the beginning I'm talking football to the 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.800
 night when every time you see your team 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.230
 I won a lot of friends but promised to arrest many enemies then 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.590
 Since today I do not want to win any enemies, I'm going to put this part 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.830
 the installed climbing stations do 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.499
 and in every sport that requires a lot of strategy 

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:04.330
 for example when you are going to make an expedition 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.760
 to climb a high wall vertical wall 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.130
 so it's not just getting you to start popping a series of 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.010
 things can be wrong 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.290
 such as 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.770
 a well-defined canopy only keep a well-defined bike 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.189
 it is very probable that you get lost on the way you go by the way 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:24.630
 very difficult and could not complete his expedition 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.370
 another thing for example 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.390
 Emma, ​​you know Gilmar. 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.910
 the warm weather and your valter words that the suspension will take 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.830
 inspection can take up to more than a day to complete. 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:36.780
 to happen 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.290
 joined I was in September well you know the right amount of equipment 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.100
 with 74 suspension 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.980
 because 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.890
 because if you will eat too much is not only the burden was very heavy you can 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.600
 get bored really easy and I could not complete 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.680
 just so it will allow - for lack of payment and you still do not 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.680
 will complete the intercession of the suspension 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.120
 and let's face it, it's no different 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.179
 before you arrive at an auction to get the property 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:09.599
 have a number of things that you have to take into account ie you have to 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.909
 arrive in milan 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:13.699
 always with a strategy in mind 

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:15.609
 and for you to formulate 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:17.389
 your strategy 

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:18.510
 you have order 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.700
 first know how the auctions work what are the types of auctions 

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:28.889
 what are the risks and benefits of each type of auction you participate in 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:32.369
 because if you arrive at an auction and take out a thing without taking anything in 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:37.469
 account you most likely have a head with which you kill yourself 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.199
 So 

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:44.619
 What are these auction types? 

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:50.239
 good there is the chance of judicial vets the Indians is if the judiciary says 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.169
 and there are still stilo bids are millions proper but it has 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:56.960
 a similar process 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.609
 and internally in formula 1 a good environment to find opportunities 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:05.609
 they bought the South American Cup 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:10.650
 - I privately do private auction is when someone 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.799
 I decided then it has to be this way. 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.409
 by means of an auction 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:20.489
 this is very common said that happens on the internet a large specialized website 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.060
 the free market 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.219
 and I will 

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:25.780
 but when it comes to real estate 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.780
 this is a very little used practice 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.699
 already the judicial auctions 

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:35.109
 I found out about the judge. 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.529
 take a property to auction through a foreclosure 

00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:43.249
 for who like the money raised from the sale of this property he can pay 

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:46.259
 a judicial debt second magnum malta pr 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.569
 for example a famous car that you may have heard about was the case 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:51.429
 from the sea 

00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:54.149
 we leave here so that companies can 

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:57.139
 It's smart of the backward economies. 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:03:59.229
 in terms of other debts 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:02.669
 and that he had no money to pay these debts 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:07.300
 With that it had its luxurious coverage in Rio de Janeiro took nothing 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.300
 to be able to pay these debts he had 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.459
 judicial auctions 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.989
 probably the best place to find real estate 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.370
 a part of the market value 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.870
 better but I know I 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.259
 O 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:31.750
 when you are going to take part in any of its authors 

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:33.599
 auction rules 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:36.599
 are somewhat more 

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:44.829
 It's as if it were with this carlos as a Formula 1 car 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:46.880
 it's the fastest car 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.809
 is the most powerful car but I never county the concer 

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:54.930
 to drive a Formula 1 car right away if you never drove 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.180
 the partners and you do not have a team specializing in patents held 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.740
 endure this 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.740
 but I'll go later 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.610
 in detail this can decouple the ace 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:10.139
 interest in driving this Formula 1 car 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:13.129
 opponents of Chávez 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:17.099
 I am a warrior and I have the process is similar to that of the judicial auctions 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.220
 the difference here 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.690
 the lender itself performs an auctioning process without the need for a judge or 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.559
 a lawsuit 

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:28.870
 this can be done because 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.250
 why when 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.250
 after this happens a lot 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:37.529
 like a bank for example 

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:41.249
 and that this process can be made agreement that has entered into an agreement of 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:44.249
 loan 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.639
 which enable a more streamlined execution process 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:54.790
 clear that the rules following these title laws 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:00.259
 but surely the process has nothing else to do that can not be alone 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:03.669
 from ideli on the social network 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:07.479
 An example of this is a great person in the Federal 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:09.059
 property financing 

00:06:09.059 --> 00:06:11.070
 and suddenly to erase 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.820
 the provision of the property because the country's cash 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.280
 he considers that although the law does not 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.639
 to be able to pay outstanding debt that person 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:23.580
 but then I make a pop specifically treated silver treats only 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.719
 of the angels of the box that the costing that are very important 

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:29.070
 What you need is to have people behind you. 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.470
 if more happen 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:34.030
 by the fact of the house without an offer in full will be Brazil you 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.190
 the institution that most lends money to purchase real estate in the 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.979
 Brazil 

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:44.930
 and with financial stations tite has a process that generally different 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:45.509
 all 

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:46.569
 of the lions 

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:49.919
 for example in the stations the proposal must be done correctly 

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:54.159
 it is made into a sealed envelope 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.439
 Who's on the floor? 

00:06:57.439 --> 00:07:00.439
 inside 

00:07:02.149 --> 00:07:05.449
 then after that date worsened exploited 

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:09.819
 the committee does not receive any further proposals 

00:07:10.899 --> 00:07:14.999
 and then she opens the proposals well with these clothes are 

00:07:14.999 --> 00:07:16.969
 washed which are not 

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:22.709
 and has all proposals but wins the one that has a height that he determined 

00:07:22.709 --> 00:07:23.699
 mall 

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:26.509
 and to show to fix anything 

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:31.759
 you have to pay a signal that rotates around 5% of the minimum bid amount 

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:32.699
 immobile 

00:07:32.699 --> 00:07:35.649
 they do this to avoid shock 

00:07:35.649 --> 00:07:40.050
 of the random proposals without bullets and solve almost 

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:43.050
 and thus disrupts the receipt process 

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:48.080
 Good people, that's what I had to tell you today. 

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.870
 did you like in the next game to go into detail with regard to 

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:57.880
 to the rules of each type of auction how the flashes are formed - 

00:07:57.879 --> 00:07:59.139
 each auction 

00:07:59.139 --> 00:08:00.939
 so that's it until next month
