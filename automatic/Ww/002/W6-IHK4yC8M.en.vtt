00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.760 

first<00:00:07.360> time<00:00:07.509> I<00:00:07.600> think<00:00:07.839> Rosie<00:00:08.200> and<00:00:08.290> everybody

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:08.770 
first time I think Rosie and everybody

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.530 
first time I think Rosie and everybody
this<00:00:08.950> as<00:00:09.340> I<00:00:09.490> said<00:00:09.670> Rosie<00:00:10.030> and<00:00:10.150> last<00:00:10.300> night<00:00:10.510> I

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:10.540 
this as I said Rosie and last night I

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.150 
this as I said Rosie and last night I
think<00:00:10.840> this<00:00:10.960> training<00:00:11.440> is<00:00:11.530> the<00:00:11.800> missing<00:00:12.010> link

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:12.160 
think this training is the missing link

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.299 
think this training is the missing link
in<00:00:12.490> a<00:00:12.580> light<00:00:12.760> so<00:00:13.059> that's<00:00:13.389> been<00:00:13.860> gone<00:00:14.860> for<00:00:15.160> way

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:15.309 
in a light so that's been gone for way

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:16.890 
in a light so that's been gone for way
too<00:00:15.370> long<00:00:15.519> and<00:00:16.000> I'm<00:00:16.119> glad<00:00:16.299> to<00:00:16.509> see<00:00:16.630> it<00:00:16.720> finally

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:16.900 
too long and I'm glad to see it finally

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.019 
too long and I'm glad to see it finally
here<00:00:17.380> and<00:00:17.560> I<00:00:17.890> think<00:00:18.189> that<00:00:18.340> what<00:00:18.489> this<00:00:18.610> training

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:19.029 
here and I think that what this training

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:21.210 
here and I think that what this training
is<00:00:19.090> doing<00:00:19.570> is<00:00:19.810> and<00:00:20.500> I'm<00:00:20.890> going<00:00:21.009> to<00:00:21.040> steal

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
is doing is and I'm going to steal

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.370 
is doing is and I'm going to steal
another<00:00:21.310> key<00:00:21.669> word<00:00:21.910> here<00:00:22.180> is<00:00:22.390> developing<00:00:23.259> a

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
another key word here is developing a

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.370 
another key word here is developing a
viral<00:00:23.860> atmosphere<00:00:24.369> of<00:00:24.489> success<00:00:24.910> it<00:00:25.779> really<00:00:26.140> is

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380
