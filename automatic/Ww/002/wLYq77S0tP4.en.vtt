transverse<00:04:55.180> velocity<00:04:55.389> and<00:04:56.020> so<00:04:56.199> I<00:04:56.259> picked<00:04:56.529> up

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
transverse velocity and so I picked up

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.969

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
forward chain gun so just shoot straight

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.320 
forward chain gun so just shoot straight
forwards<00:05:14.949> form<00:05:15.159> when<00:05:15.310> that's<00:05:15.490> happening<00:05:15.610> you

forwards form when that's happening you

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.909 
forwards form when that's happening you
all<00:05:16.419> like<00:05:16.599> to<00:05:16.629> have<00:05:16.810> it<00:05:16.930> running<00:05:17.110> as<00:05:17.289> well<00:05:17.469> yeah

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
all like to have it running as well yeah

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:20.100 
all like to have it running as well yeah
click<00:05:18.430> it<00:05:18.639> slowly<00:05:19.300> you'll<00:05:19.779> get<00:05:19.870> a<00:05:19.930> rhythm

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
click it slowly you'll get a rhythm

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.809 
click it slowly you'll get a rhythm
going<00:05:20.259> so<00:05:21.099> you're<00:05:21.219> not<00:05:21.279> actually<00:05:21.400> firing

00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:21.819 
going so you're not actually firing

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:24.179 
going so you're not actually firing
wasting<00:05:22.240> bullets<00:05:22.360> but<00:05:22.689> the<00:05:22.870> gun<00:05:23.860> will<00:05:24.039> be

00:05:24.179 --> 00:05:24.189 
wasting bullets but the gun will be

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:25.980 
wasting bullets but the gun will be
turning<00:05:24.460> then<00:05:24.729> it<00:05:24.879> subsea<00:05:25.539> improves<00:05:25.930> your

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
turning then it subsea improves your

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.730 
turning then it subsea improves your
jobs<00:05:26.379> are<00:05:26.560> done<00:05:26.589> yeah<00:05:27.009> exactly<00:05:28.560> but<00:05:29.560> as<00:05:29.710> for

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
jobs are done yeah exactly but as for

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.260 
jobs are done yeah exactly but as for
hitting<00:05:30.159> it<00:05:30.279> when<00:05:30.370> they<00:05:30.460> are<00:05:30.610> strafing<00:05:30.969> around

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
hitting it when they are strafing around

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.179 
hitting it when they are strafing around
you<00:05:31.419> and<00:05:31.509> things<00:05:31.749> there's<00:05:32.589> not<00:05:32.710> really<00:05:32.770> much

00:05:33.179 --> 00:05:33.189 
you and things there's not really much

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:34.980 
you and things there's not really much
to<00:05:33.249> say<00:05:33.430> other<00:05:33.580> than<00:05:33.789> just<00:05:34.029> practice<00:05:34.509> it<00:05:34.659> apart

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
to say other than just practice it apart

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.749 
to say other than just practice it apart
from<00:05:35.199> 10<00:05:35.469> to<00:05:35.589> watch<00:05:35.740> the<00:05:35.979> bullets<00:05:36.310> the<00:05:36.490> tracer

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:36.759 
from 10 to watch the bullets the tracer

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:38.490 
from 10 to watch the bullets the tracer
bullets<00:05:37.150> rather<00:05:37.419> than<00:05:37.659> the<00:05:37.779> crosshair<00:05:38.139> itself

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
bullets rather than the crosshair itself

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.200 
bullets rather than the crosshair itself
because<00:05:39.250> the<00:05:39.339> bullets<00:05:39.550> have<00:05:39.669> a<00:05:39.699> travel<00:05:39.939> time

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
because the bullets have a travel time

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.339 
because the bullets have a travel time
it<00:05:40.389> will<00:05:40.479> help<00:05:40.599> you<00:05:40.779> to<00:05:40.839> see<00:05:41.020> when<00:05:41.199> you're

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:41.349 
it will help you to see when you're

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:42.390 
it will help you to see when you're
hitting<00:05:41.529> them<00:05:41.770> when<00:05:41.919> you're<00:05:42.009> lagging<00:05:42.159> behind

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
hitting them when you're lagging behind

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.219 
hitting them when you're lagging behind
when<00:05:42.789> you're<00:05:42.879> going<00:05:43.029> ahead<00:05:43.150> so<00:05:43.479> watch<00:05:44.050> the

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:44.229 
when you're going ahead so watch the

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:46.079 
when you're going ahead so watch the
bullets<00:05:44.500> draw<00:05:44.650> in<00:05:44.710> the<00:05:44.830> crosshair<00:05:45.250> very<00:05:45.939> nice

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:46.089 
bullets draw in the crosshair very nice
