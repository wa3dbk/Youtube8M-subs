00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 at a distance of about 24 hours from the 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.880
 closing of the mantova comics and games 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.820
 2015 seemed at least a duty to me 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.679
 polite to thank all those who 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.599
 they participated who came to the 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.190
 our conferences and who have interacted 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.150
 with us in a manner to say the least 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.430
 exemplary thanks very heartily like 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.220
 they say the night brings advice and 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.410
 just tonight really jumped in 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.340
 mind this idea that was born with the purpose 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.170
 of abbreviation here it would be good one 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.840
 musical pack but as youtube 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.390
 enjoys playing with my year, the 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.670
 we will see over time 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.760
 what angular beers is soon 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.539
 said these are monthly appointments 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.280
 but what do I say monthly magazines but that 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.370
 I say weekly it is about 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.140
 appointments parallel to my videos that 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.020
 they are born with the idea of interacting 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.359
 with you in more massive doses e 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.070
 especially more frequent 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.960
 but how each episode will come 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.299
 issued more or less per hour 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.450
 of the aperitif then of the cap ed 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.619
 will have a main theme that you or braves 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.979
 children of good woman 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:17.220
 you may indeed have to comment here on 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.170
 tube or on the corner but not only seen that 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.869
 by now you know my role well from 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.009
 big brother who hurts all 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.140
 your comments 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.060
 I will be happy not only to read the 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.310
 your opinions about the topic 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.880
 main but also your proposals 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.640
 about the following possible arguments 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:40.320
 but the topics which will be 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:43.320
 well of course so much misfortune 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.140
 or let's face it but every now and then we'll talk 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.140
 also news news video games 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.210
 of articles read online and online 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.490
 obviously I mean the short corner of 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.729
 all a bit the main topic today 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.729
 is 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.240
 that's right to stay on topic with 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.100
 last six and a half years from my life 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.300
 I have no intention of making you one 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.280
 morton review 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.010
 forget it assholes but I want you 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.040
 talk about this title only with 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.720
 one word thanks thanks to all 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.720
 those who about ten days ago 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.600
 connected to my tweet channel in 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.300
 which show my first live is mine 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.700
 first gameplay of mordor at a distance of 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.620
 about two hours from the beginning of the title 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.300
 being at the beginning it was a bit like shit 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.060
 in the most chaotic situations but the idea 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.630
 of maine unisys system for what of 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.430
 gender 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.470
 certainly the fulcrum of all 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.060
 video game is the real news that this 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.220
 led title made me immediately 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.370
 go crazy in many of you 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.780
 advised to persevere with the game 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.480
 oh my God he wasn't going to 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.200
 but abandon it of course you 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.850
 damn dick you were right now i'm 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.820
 at about 10 hours of play and they are 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.340
 literally a god on earth 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.230
 he ucs shit on me just me 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.720
 see now perhaps the title has become 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.060
 even too simple but it is not 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.430
 important because the idea of ​​being able to do 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.100
 ass to any captain commander 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.590
 regardless of its level it is 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:21.190
 an idea that truly satisfies you in 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.330
 almost unexpectedly exact way or i 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.709
 proud toe 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.840
 the only two downsides from 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:29.440
 title are a technical level rather 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:32.049
 poor that said between us means that 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.640
 graphically the shit especially if 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.709
 played on next gen 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.780
 and especially if played immediately after 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.910
 order trust the comparison really 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.640
 embarrassing but above all the fact that 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.329
 the main protagonist is the plot 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.829
 let's say it's not like that 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:51.040
 interesting and above all relevance 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:54.130
 with the lord of the rings they present 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.930
 but in rather weak quantity would have 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.730
 could quietly be titled 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:01.220
 the shadow of a cremona that did not change 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.560
 you really liked this game 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.200
 just to emphasize the interaction 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.569
 with you I ask you even if this 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.700
 heading can always interest you hurt 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:14.290
 another heading this section if 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.729
 prefer to talk about quantum physics 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.739
 tell me you do n't really care 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:20.750
 to know why a video like this 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.630
 takes relatively little time for 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:27.020
 be edited and edited on 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:29.810
 tube and therefore it is all a matter of 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.500
 speed to be more on the wayans piece 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.360
 it's on the piece 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.360
 go well the word to you guys 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.240
 I finally thank that boy very much 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.160
 excuse me but I don't remember the name that 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.770
 last year at games week 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.860
 gave me the shadow of mordor e 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.440
 Finally, I really thank the three 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:56.040
 wretches that yesterday at mantova comics 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:59.870
 given to me the mimosas that have me 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.870
 parried ass with erika 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:10.270
 that two balls that is interminable 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.270
 fuck from the god
