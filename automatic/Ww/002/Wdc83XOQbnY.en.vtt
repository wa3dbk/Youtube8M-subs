00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 France 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.000
 n the most successful research in this 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.799
 areas allowed to create device 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:11.039
 then you can install on 

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:11.519
 countries 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.809
 historically structures found 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:16.339
 on interconnect this device can be 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:17.529
 used as a focal point 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:22.650
 the death of this teleportation system concessions 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.890
 however soon after that we lost 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.560
 group communication 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.710
 immediately after the device was 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.710
 posted we tried to find 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.850
 other guidance methods are pleased that 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.290
 all equipment in this lab 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.050
 is obsolete if we want 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.129
 healing processes someone must 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:41.750
 go there they step up I'm afraid 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.480
 that you are the only one who can do this 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.510
 there everyone else will have to follow 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.600
 for the equipment 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.510
 we can deliver members to the place where 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.850
 the observation group stopped but I'm afraid 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.660
 what's the chance that you have to 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.770
 face monsters very much 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:57.350
 is high 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.470
 when you find devices including 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.520
 year and tune transmitter not yet 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.180
 achieved maximum 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.440
 seventh 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.440
 we will open a reconstruction 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.160
 overhaul to return as soon as received 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.680
 signal 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.950
 we will rush to offer them 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.610
 keep it open only 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.180
 a short period of time which is now 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.790
 I started the process of charging the phone when 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.640
 This Sergey Storozhenko only 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.700
 the field will open it will very quickly become 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.420
 stable author seventeenth me 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.110
 do you hear everything is ready percentage card 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.280
 need to 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.680
 Ksyusha 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.760
 so-so 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:34.029
 everything 

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:38.339
 with myself
