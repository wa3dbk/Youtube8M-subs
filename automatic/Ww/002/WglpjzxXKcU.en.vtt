00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:13.039
 add that a quarter of a century and Stavropol 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:14.629
 sports school channel gaming 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:17.480
 equipment here our thankful 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.220
 honored coach of ussr basil law 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.220
 a real holiday begins 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.109
 along with the fact that several 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:27.349
 nominations 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:28.479
 and not because they became 

00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:31.910
 absolute champions of games 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.350
 number of molecules 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.350
 starting from the west so the gunman himself 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.850
 despite the problems and the most difficult 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.460
 the patient is fantastic 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.200
 stitches 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.740
 when the driver who does not help 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.870
 experienced coaches 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.230
 former miss documentation 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.230
 children are required to show 12 thousand 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.750
 such an attempt to prove the main 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.500
 methodical direction 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.500
 training athletes 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.370
 at the beginning of the sales culture senior 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.740
 trainer 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.580
 Acrobats are being trained equally 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.780
 the stronger 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:12.800
 four 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.939
 because money 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:14.910
 rabbi 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.260
 this is also one preparation 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.460
 physical training 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.560
 basic training and only serious 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.530
 injuries right now every one of these 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.740
 components 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.880
 we are all trying to tell 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.880
 percent 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.840
 to train athletes 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.470
 performing a complex item 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.080
 but after being if tracks 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.000
 it is necessary that this element 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.360
 drank simulators conditions 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.120
 the harder the jump 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.520
 the more time 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.630
 more reps and these people 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.940
 must pass 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.220
 we must always remember 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.620
 that production is steadily analog 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.290
 engaging as much as possible 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.210
 quantities 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.930
 technical destroyer 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.979
 in this case, I mean 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.089
 diverse simulator device 

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:12.839
 but now we see work on a special 

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:14.419
 projectile which represents 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:17.419
 springboard for frequent get along beggars 

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:19.839
 we started bye open warehouse 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:21.329
 because 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:22.689
 on it happens 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:25.559
 formation for this we need 

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:26.849
 because there are no 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.969
 school bell to move 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:30.319
 on this projectile 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.839
 maybe he as the most correct 

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:34.799
 put acrobatic technique 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.799
 jumps 

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:39.620
 we show 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.979
 as phased from idle 

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:45.389
 the so-called 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:48.389
 screw preparation 

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:51.069
 one and a half 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.069
 and so on until four four and a half 

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:56.819
 to the maximum possible to 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:57.889
 present tense 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:00.889
 such pirouettes 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.089
 but now brand world champion alexey 

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:30.379
 Kozlovsky 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:33.090
 he remembers a flip with a turn of 1440 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.129
 degrees 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:36.139
 114 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:37.609
 next jump 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:40.339
 will we have four and a half karakai 

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:43.339
 under the name 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:47.859
 I must say that in order to 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.369
 let you baturine provided 

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:52.399
 but did not become the main track and it should 

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:55.529
 repeat from five hundred and a thousand times 

00:03:55.529 --> 00:03:57.889
 only under such conditions for active 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:00.849
 remain robust and interference resistant 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:02.389
 and now look at this 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:04.239
 a jump that nobody in the world 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.549
 in komi alexey performs 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.779
 such a score in turn there 

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:12.779
 5 turns 

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:16.680
 And this training on the same apparatus of husband with 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.039
 using depreciation 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:19.029
 suspensions 

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:20.500
 they have it not only 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.440
 husband and athlete answer almost 15 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.800
 kilograms 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.190
 but most importantly does not allow him to go beyond 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.490
 snowboard limits 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.449
 protects against possible injury 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:33.300
 I must say that on my own 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.639
 but the tracks do these exercises 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:37.889
 guys 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:39.240
 exactly one year 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.090
 training a master of sports candidate 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.090
 quite difficult yet 

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:47.430
 but clear glade 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.789
 do fulfill them 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:52.789
 pretty confident 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.069
 while it is also praise 

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:07.069
 but on the other hand the blow is done 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:10.999
 This is the next stage of preparation where 

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:12.999
 athletes can perform 

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:15.999
 double flip double second flip 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:21.990
 and now 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.990
 m tall grouping 

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:46.599
 here is another person 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:48.789
 contribute to the work of one of 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:49.729
 major 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:50.770
 molokova 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.830
 transition from the middle of the combination 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.830
 let's say double flip great-grandson 

00:05:57.619 --> 00:05:59.319
 final 

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:00.740
 That is 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.919
 most difficult to accomplish 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:05.919
 and the most technically difficult for me 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:07.509
 in order to make this work 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:09.479
 clarified negative 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:11.309
 we invented a special 

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:12.499
 device 

00:06:12.499 --> 00:06:14.119
 helping to practice skills 

00:06:14.119 --> 00:06:15.330
 transition 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.229
 difficult combinations 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:20.229
 what do you have given 

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:35.789
 all kinds of transitional 

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:37.819
 connections with different endpoints 

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:39.599
 members by elements 

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:41.610
 but now used more 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:41.880
 he 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.849
 recall the organizers 

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:46.020
 athletes to work out 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.560
 trade element as much as possible 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.550
 the difficulties 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.569
 for example the country of santos pilots 

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:53.869
 which you see now 

00:06:53.869 --> 00:06:55.919
 what happens we work 

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:58.469
 so people and scientists but wants to go 

00:06:58.469 --> 00:07:00.729
 through a very big utrish juxtaposition 

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:03.729
 but this on a similar projectile 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:06.650
 you yourself as a group
