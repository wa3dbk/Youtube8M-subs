00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.000
 soft and light like 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.650
 perina 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.680
 the sweet symbol 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.120
 was invented 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.700
 in 1900 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.500
 the pastry chef bert sachs who created it in 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.240
 honor of the anna dancer 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.840
 pavlova who was visiting the country in 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.950
 that moment 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.950
 we prepare the whole 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:41.180
 ingredients for 8 10 people for the base 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:44.090
 egg whites average eggs 250 g of 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.980
 fine sugar 15 grams of cornstarch a 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.050
 spoon of apple vinegar or wine 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.020
 white a teaspoon of extract of 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.790
 vanilla one gram of salt 2 grams of 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.830
 cream of tartar or four grams of 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.140
 baking powder for cakes for the 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:01:00.260
 seal 300 milliliters of cream 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.260
 fresh 30 grams of sugar 80 g of 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.410
 blueberries 80 g of raspberries three fruits 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.560
 passion a kiwi 150 grams of 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.560
 strawberries 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.520
 we begin the preparation in having inga 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.350
 putting in the cup of a planetary mixer 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.750
 thrown out of whips or if you don't have the 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:21.470
 planetary with a whisk the egg whites 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.830
 at room temperature and we also combine the 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.830
 salt 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.659
 as soon as the egg whites begin to 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.990
 become white we will use others 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.990
 ingredients 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.360
 now we combine the cream of tartar 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.259
 if you don't try to mortar talos you can 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:54.880
 replace it with chemical yeast per 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.819
 powdered sweets 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.759
 the vanilla extract if you don't find it 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:04.140
 you can use the seeds of the diva of e 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.140
 berry or vanillin 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.380
 and then we will combine the sugar mixed there 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.910
 cornstarch that previously sifted 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.110
 a spoon at a time that a 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.110
 determine the ingredients 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.910
 and together we add the vinegar maybe in 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.910
 twice 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:36.870
 the egg whites mixture is well assembled as 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:40.890
 see now we just have to train 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.739
 a disk on one the baking paper that me 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.080
 previously buttered and lined with 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.569
 baking paper so that as you see the 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:52.200
 baking paper does not move anymore 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:54.980
 now, but let's empty in the middle 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.980
 of the card 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.830
 and know how I said let's try to train 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:24.000
 a disc that has a diameter of about 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:27.420
 20 22 cm if you want with the spatula you can 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.310
 also create decorative borders such as 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.670
 you see doing this by giving 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.349
 meringue ripples e 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:39.739
 leaving the edges slightly higher 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:39.739
 of the center in this way 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:46.799
 here I turned on the oven at 250 degrees 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.730
 in static mode and once 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.890
 we have reached the temperature 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.590
 we could put it in the oven though 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.360
 lowering the thermostat to 120 degrees 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.579
 once baked let it cook 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:03.750
 for at least an hour and a half without ever 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:05.760
 touch it after an hour and a half 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.709
 I turned off the oven and left 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.680
 the pavlova inside to cool 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:16.709
 completely with the oven door 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:20.190
 half-closed now we can show it from 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:22.049
 oven put it on a serving dish e 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.240
 begin to garnish it 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.860
 let's take care of whipping cream now 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.419
 we take a bowl that we put 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:35.220
 previously in the refrigerator a 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:39.440
 cool off very well let's put it to his 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.440
 the cream is very cold inside 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.960
 and we assemble it with the whips of one 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.960
 whipper 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.000
 add the sugar 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:11.510
 the cream and well whipped now let's go to 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:14.660
 place it in the center of the pavlova la 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:17.590
 But we spread for good without cover 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.590
 entirely the edges 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:25.910
 finally we look at everything with fruit 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:29.669
 fresh cut into small pieces 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:31.830
 I used raspberry and kiwi strawberries here 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:34.650
 passion fruit which is a fruit 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:37.590
 typical Australian as you see you cut 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.810
 in half and the seeds are extracted with the 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.110
 pulp that we will then use for the 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.110
 gasket 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.780
 let's start with the kiwi 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.000
 Well what do you say I'm sure you bird 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:03.990
 he would be very proud of me 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.990
 good test at all 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.780
 Well what do you say I'm sure it pours 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:24.469
 he would be very proud of me 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:24.469
 good test to all still adds 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.240
 ok
