00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
wanting to go around the moon and and

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.030 
wanting to go around the moon and and
you<00:01:34.079> know<00:01:34.110> there's<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.470> lot<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.590> stuff<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:35.009> can

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
of a big pickup truck and so you know

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.819 
of a big pickup truck and so you know
history<00:01:39.360> in<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.479> making<00:01:39.570> what<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.409> want<00:01:40.740> to

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
history in the making what I want to

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.789 
history in the making what I want to
know<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.159> if<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.400> had<00:01:41.549> 150<00:01:42.329> million<00:01:42.720> dollars<00:01:43.259> I'd

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
know is if I had 150 million dollars I'd

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.770 
know is if I had 150 million dollars I'd
want<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.159> spend<00:01:44.220> more<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:45.060> land<00:01:45.299> on<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.630> moon

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
want to spend more to land on the moon

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.200 
want to spend more to land on the moon
and<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.740> what<00:01:46.979> would<00:01:47.100> be<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.369> cost<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.820> land<00:01:48.030> on

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
and so what would be the cost to land on

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.149 
and so what would be the cost to land on
the<00:01:48.360> moon<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.659> would<00:01:48.899> be<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.380> if<00:01:49.770> that's<00:01:50.009> the

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
the moon that would be and if that's the

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.270 
the moon that would be and if that's the
case<00:01:50.360> why<00:01:51.360> should<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.780> taxpayer<00:01:52.290> here<00:01:52.799> why

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
case why should the taxpayer here why

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.679 
case why should the taxpayer here why
should<00:01:53.490> we<00:01:53.610> spend<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:54.090> much<00:01:54.210> money<00:01:54.450> the

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
should we spend so much money the

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.870 
should we spend so much money the
billions<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.619> saying<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.130> return<00:01:56.490> us<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.700> the

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
billions the saying to return us to the

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.050 
billions the saying to return us to the
moon<00:01:57.119> so<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.990> question<00:01:58.380> really<00:01:58.560> is

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
moon so the question really is

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.219 
moon so the question really is
commercially<00:02:00.060> can<00:02:00.270> we<00:02:00.390> get<00:02:00.540> back<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:00.960> moon

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
commercially can we get back to the moon

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.649 
commercially can we get back to the moon
for<00:02:01.740> far<00:02:02.009> less<00:02:02.310> than<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.909> government's<00:02:03.509> been

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
for far less than the government's been

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.149 
for far less than the government's been
saying<00:02:03.960> they're<00:02:04.259> going<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.439> have<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.680> spend<00:02:04.920> to

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
saying they're going to have to spend to

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.709 
saying they're going to have to spend to
get<00:02:05.280> us<00:02:05.430> back<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.820> moon<00:02:06.090> so<00:02:06.479> that's<00:02:06.630> the

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
get us back to the moon so that's the

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.389 
get us back to the moon so that's the
cool<00:02:06.899> thing<00:02:06.930> about<00:02:07.140> commercial<00:02:07.829> raises<00:02:08.250> all
