00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:25.599
 10 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.199
 these are the 24-month-old ears 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.000
 weighing about 350 pounds 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.890
 are living the end of a phase that traditionally livestock farming 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.910
 it was called a re-creation 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.940
 when to achieve a corporation structure that physical growth 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.750
 begins to reduce, resulting in a more pronounced deposition of meat 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.630
 and fat 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.630
 kiprop will cover the finish of the carcass 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.840
 in this stage was to gain another 120 and 150 kilos 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.080
 at a stage known as termination or finishing 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.760
 At this stage it may occur in two different production systems 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.330
 involved are fed exclusively on grazing and on 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.580
 mineral swimming 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.080
 or in the confinement practiced during the dry season using food 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.080
 bulky and preserved and concentrated 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.320
 in the finishing the pulp there are some management modalities adapted to the 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.930
 conditions of each Brazilian region 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.330
 in the period supposed to use Basque and mineral supplementation in almost all 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.580
 parents 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.660
 during drought pasteur and multiple supplementation are used 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.210
 with senile salmon or football protein still winter pasteur with 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.440
 fear and sorghum for grazing in the north part of the northeast and the portion 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.450
 capital of the west-central 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.470
 already in the south and in the subtropical regions of the Southeast and Midwest 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.120
 oatmeal donation is more common and I found it well 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.750
 the past system also allows the semiconfining that is characterized by the 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.750
 feed away more concentrated supplementation 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:23.889
 if at the end of confinement cattle rancher seek the sale of animals in the 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:25.329
 off season 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:29.459
 when prices are more rewarding in the 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.069
 costs are much better with the possibility of greater profitability 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.069
 due to lower production costs 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:46.589
 In addition, the step-by-step production system can be 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:50.649
 great impacts on productivity, aiming to reduce fattening time 

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:53.649
 through appropriate pasture management practices 

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:56.480
 Fodder supplementation 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.599
 and genetic improvement of the herd 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:00.680
 to consider 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.469
 a 36-month-old slaughtered animal weighing 17 arrobas 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:06.659
 earned per year of life 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:11.619
 5 23 arrobas while lime beaten 24 months 

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:17.979
 weighing 16 arrobas won color year of life in 2007 is the people know we realize 

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:21.039
 that the gain will be the vehicle four times greater
