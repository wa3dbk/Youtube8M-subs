00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.390
 that she left with someone other than

 the second fault I film his bases to 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.940
 the television with my one and only 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.890
 game I look at the screen I enough for me 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.150
 the screen to avoid being 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.770
 discovery 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:02:00.120
 but despite my efforts I still cry 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.830
 more than the first and I feel good 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.830

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:11.310
 because it's pretty sarhani 2 is 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.310
 exaggerated it's exorbitant 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.790
 it's an invented story that me 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.160
 not about why I say why 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.010
 my tears stop but as it works 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.930
 I do not understand that 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:36.200
 geneviÃ¨ve and guy are for nothing in 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:38.629
 my tears sometimes 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.519
 camping in the movie I'm crying I'm 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:46.730
 ask if it's about them or me 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:48.590

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:56.650
 do not cry it does not do these standards 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:03:01.910
 proposed moved misplaced and that's the 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:05.959
 third time I see the film in 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:10.640
 company of my one and only love and 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:14.250
 two of our very good friends I warn 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.020
 an entourage to avoid any embarrassment 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.550
 it allows me to be freer and to 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.300
 to cry from beginning to end without even 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.300
 try to tell me again 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.940

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.940
 first time I understand
