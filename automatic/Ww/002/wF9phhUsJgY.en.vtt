all<00:00:00.480> right<00:00:01.350> here<00:00:01.800> is<00:00:01.979> the<00:00:02.220> tutorial<00:00:02.399> for<00:00:02.879> the

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
all right here is the tutorial for the

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.640 
all right here is the tutorial for the
paintbrush<00:00:03.330> color<00:00:03.570> change<00:00:03.899> before<00:00:04.410> I

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
paintbrush color change before I

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.610 
paintbrush color change before I
actually<00:00:04.859> get<00:00:05.130> into<00:00:05.480> the<00:00:06.480> explanation<00:00:07.140> I'm

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
actually get into the explanation I'm

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.020 
actually get into the explanation I'm
going<00:00:07.770> to<00:00:07.859> do<00:00:07.919> a<00:00:07.950> quick<00:00:08.040> performance<00:00:08.790> for

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
going to do a quick performance for

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.480 
going to do a quick performance for
people<00:00:09.360> who<00:00:09.750> are<00:00:09.960> unaware<00:00:10.620> what<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.130> pinkish

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
people who are unaware what the pinkish

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.640 
people who are unaware what the pinkish
color<00:00:11.759> change<00:00:12.150> looks<00:00:12.450> like<00:00:12.660> or<00:00:12.870> even<00:00:13.080> what<00:00:13.590> it

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
color change looks like or even what it

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.000 
color change looks like or even what it
is<00:00:13.740> for<00:00:13.950> that<00:00:14.040> matter<00:00:14.219> so<00:00:15.020> here<00:00:16.020> is<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.590> quick

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
is for that matter so here is the quick

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.640 
is for that matter so here is the quick
performance<00:00:17.730> I'm<00:00:18.390> going<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.630> take<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.080> top

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
performance I'm going to take the top

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.300 
performance I'm going to take the top
card<00:00:20.449> the<00:00:21.449> queen<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:21.869> clubs<00:00:22.170> I'll<00:00:22.590> take<00:00:23.160> the

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
card the queen of clubs I'll take the

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.009 
card the queen of clubs I'll take the
coin<00:00:23.580> if<00:00:23.789> I<00:00:23.939> rub<00:00:24.119> it<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.269> couple<00:00:24.449> times<00:00:24.570> against

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
coin if I rub it a couple times against

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.009 
coin if I rub it a couple times against
the<00:00:25.170> deck<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:25.650> should<00:00:26.220> actually<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:27.019> change

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
the deck it should actually a change

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.209 
the deck it should actually a change
into<00:00:28.289> your<00:00:28.519> 50<00:00:29.519> hearts<00:00:30.439> done<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.679> let's<00:00:32.070> get

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
into your 50 hearts done that let's get

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.360 
into your 50 hearts done that let's get
into<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:33.059> over-the-shoulder<00:00:34.370> explanation

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
into the over-the-shoulder explanation

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.180 
into the over-the-shoulder explanation
all<00:00:36.000> right<00:00:36.300> here<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.899> explanation<00:00:37.620> for

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
all right here is the explanation for

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.280 
all right here is the explanation for
the<00:00:38.309> paintbrush<00:00:38.670> color<00:00:38.969> change<00:00:39.329> now<00:00:39.960> before<00:00:40.110> I

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
the paintbrush color change now before I

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.350 
the paintbrush color change now before I
actually<00:00:40.530> start<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.190> explain<00:00:41.640> what<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.030> i'm

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
actually start to explain what it is i'm

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.209 
actually start to explain what it is i'm
going<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.840> show<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.290> what<00:00:43.649> happened<00:00:44.010> the

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
going to show you what happened the

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.889 
going to show you what happened the
mechanics<00:00:44.670> behind<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.239> color<00:00:45.420> change<00:00:45.750> in

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
mechanics behind the color change in

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.020 
mechanics behind the color change in
slow<00:00:46.079> motion<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:47.100> we<00:00:47.219> can<00:00:47.309> give<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.520> gist<00:00:47.879> of

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
slow motion so we can give the gist of

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.540 
slow motion so we can give the gist of
what's<00:00:48.239> happening<00:00:49.039> so<00:00:50.039> here<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.399> in

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
what's happening so here it is in

00:00:50.550 --> 00:01:01.320 
what's happening so here it is in
slow-motion

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.330 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:09.430 

once<00:01:02.330> again

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.940 

and<00:01:09.850> that's<00:01:10.850> the<00:01:10.970> paintbrush<00:01:11.330> color<00:01:11.570> change

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
and that's the paintbrush color change

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.370 
and that's the paintbrush color change
now<00:01:12.950> here's<00:01:13.280> the<00:01:13.460> explanation<00:01:14.020> what<00:01:15.020> you<00:01:15.170> want

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
now here's the explanation what you want

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.600 
now here's the explanation what you want
to<00:01:15.440> do<00:01:15.590> is<00:01:15.740> you<00:01:15.770> want<00:01:15.860> to<00:01:16.040> get<00:01:16.130> a<00:01:16.160> break<00:01:16.400> on<00:01:16.550> the

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
to do is you want to get a break on the

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.790 
to do is you want to get a break on the
two<00:01:16.940> top<00:01:17.180> cards<00:01:17.600> to<00:01:17.750> perform<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:19.900> change<00:01:20.900> what

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
two top cards to perform the change what

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.860 
two top cards to perform the change what
I<00:01:21.830> usually<00:01:22.010> do<00:01:22.340> is<00:01:22.370> the<00:01:22.700> snap<00:01:22.940> double<00:01:23.330> which<00:01:23.600> is

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
I usually do is the snap double which is

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.570 
I usually do is the snap double which is
you<00:01:24.200> pretty<00:01:24.440> much<00:01:24.500> ripping<00:01:24.890> off<00:01:25.070> the<00:01:25.220> top<00:01:25.430> two

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
you pretty much ripping off the top two

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.230 
you pretty much ripping off the top two
cards<00:01:25.790> one<00:01:26.510> to<00:01:26.810> push<00:01:27.590> down<00:01:27.620> place<00:01:28.280> your<00:01:28.310> index

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
cards one to push down place your index

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.130 
cards one to push down place your index
finger<00:01:29.660> into<00:01:29.780> the<00:01:29.900> little<00:01:30.770> gap<00:01:31.750> push<00:01:32.750> my<00:01:32.930> thumb

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
finger into the little gap push my thumb

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.350 
finger into the little gap push my thumb
down<00:01:33.320> and<00:01:33.620> up<00:01:33.920> these<00:01:34.280> fingers<00:01:34.670> release<00:01:35.000> and

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
down and up these fingers release and

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.020 
down and up these fingers release and
the<00:01:36.080> break<00:01:36.290> will<00:01:36.590> pop<00:01:36.890> over<00:01:37.280> to<00:01:37.460> my<00:01:37.640> right<00:01:37.790> side

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
the break will pop over to my right side

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.790 
the break will pop over to my right side
and<00:01:38.330> I<00:01:38.390> just<00:01:38.570> insert<00:01:38.870> my<00:01:39.050> pinky<00:01:39.380> into<00:01:39.680> the

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
and I just insert my pinky into the

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.980 
and I just insert my pinky into the
break<00:01:39.980> now<00:01:40.970> you<00:01:41.030> can<00:01:41.210> do<00:01:41.330> whatever<00:01:41.540> you<00:01:41.780> are

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
break now you can do whatever you are

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.290 
break now you can do whatever you are
you're<00:01:42.170> most<00:01:42.320> comfortable<00:01:42.470> with<00:01:42.890> with<00:01:43.430> once

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
you're most comfortable with with once

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.620 
you're most comfortable with with once
you<00:01:44.510> got<00:01:44.690> the<00:01:44.840> break<00:01:45.340> then<00:01:46.340> you<00:01:46.940> want<00:01:47.120> to<00:01:47.180> do

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
you got the break then you want to do

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.350 
you got the break then you want to do
the<00:01:47.750> double<00:01:48.020> left<00:01:48.580> any<00:01:49.580> double<00:01:49.820> left<00:01:49.970> is<00:01:50.120> fine

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
the double left any double left is fine

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.350 
the double left any double left is fine
in<00:01:50.600> the<00:01:50.870> performance<00:01:51.320> I<00:01:51.440> you<00:01:51.500> see<00:01:51.860> us<00:01:52.360> Stuart

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
in the performance I you see us Stuart

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.070 
in the performance I you see us Stuart
Goren<00:01:53.630> double<00:01:53.900> turn<00:01:54.050> over<00:01:54.290> but<00:01:55.900> do<00:01:56.900> whatever

Goren double turn over but do whatever
double<00:01:57.530> of<00:01:57.620> that<00:01:57.650> you're<00:01:58.040> most<00:01:58.220> comfortable

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 
double of that you're most comfortable

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.700 
double of that you're most comfortable
with<00:01:58.930> once<00:01:59.930> you've<00:02:00.050> done<00:02:00.229> the<00:02:00.320> double<00:02:00.410> left

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
with once you've done the double left

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.760 
with once you've done the double left
you're<00:02:01.520> going<00:02:01.790> to<00:02:02.000> a<00:02:02.050> show<00:02:03.050> whatever<00:02:03.320> the<00:02:03.530> card

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
you're going to a show whatever the card

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.890 
you're going to a show whatever the card
is<00:02:03.920> ace<00:02:04.220> of<00:02:04.370> diamonds<00:02:04.520> for<00:02:04.850> example<00:02:05.240> and<00:02:05.690> I<00:02:05.750> get

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
is ace of diamonds for example and I get

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.540 
is ace of diamonds for example and I get
a<00:02:05.930> break<00:02:06.170> out<00:02:06.350> of<00:02:06.380> those<00:02:06.530> two<00:02:06.590> top<00:02:06.979> cards<00:02:07.280> again

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
a break out of those two top cards again

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.219 
a break out of those two top cards again
because<00:02:08.149> you're<00:02:08.270> going<00:02:08.360> to<00:02:08.420> pick<00:02:08.600> them<00:02:08.780> up<00:02:08.899> but

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
because you're going to pick them up but

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.490
