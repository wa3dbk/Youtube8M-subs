00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.709 
around in my speed is already on 15 and
so<00:02:08.979> far<00:02:09.250> all<00:02:09.519> you<00:02:09.759> need<00:02:09.909> to<00:02:09.969> do<00:02:10.090> is<00:02:11.249> type<00:02:12.249> /

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:12.719 
so far all you need to do is type /

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:14.700 
so far all you need to do is type /
snake<00:02:13.719> and

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
snake and

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.740 
snake and
the<00:02:14.800> map<00:02:14.980> will<00:02:15.100> be<00:02:15.160> generated<00:02:15.790> automatically

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
the map will be generated automatically

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.560 
the map will be generated automatically
so<00:02:16.990> you<00:02:17.050> don't<00:02:17.260> have<00:02:17.350> to<00:02:17.530> do<00:02:17.620> anything<00:02:17.950> and<00:02:18.570> it

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
so you don't have to do anything and it

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.180 
so you don't have to do anything and it
is<00:02:19.720> recommended<00:02:20.260> to<00:02:20.290> be<00:02:20.500> on<00:02:20.620> a<00:02:20.650> flat<00:02:20.950> world

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
is recommended to be on a flat world

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.970 
is recommended to be on a flat world
because<00:02:21.520> if<00:02:21.640> you<00:02:21.730> are<00:02:21.850> on<00:02:21.970> a<00:02:22.110> on<00:02:23.110> a<00:02:23.170> non-flat

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
because if you are on a on a non-flat

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.340 
because if you are on a on a non-flat
world<00:02:24.250> some<00:02:25.030> things<00:02:25.300> may<00:02:25.420> happen<00:02:25.690> maybe<00:02:26.050> if

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
world some things may happen maybe if

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.830 
world some things may happen maybe if
you<00:02:26.560> build<00:02:26.890> it<00:02:27.010> on<00:02:27.070> a<00:02:27.360> but<00:02:28.360> in<00:02:28.450> place<00:02:28.660> where

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
you build it on a but in place where

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.530 
you build it on a but in place where
there's<00:02:29.020> a<00:02:29.140> mountain<00:02:29.320> in<00:02:29.770> it<00:02:30.240> overrides<00:02:31.240> the

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
there's a mountain in it overrides the

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.600 
there's a mountain in it overrides the
mountain<00:02:31.960> in<00:02:32.110> you<00:02:32.350> get<00:02:32.500> stuck<00:02:32.860> there<00:02:33.040> probably

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
mountain in you get stuck there probably

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.870 
mountain in you get stuck there probably
that's<00:02:33.910> one<00:02:34.330> of<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.510> issues<00:02:34.590> in<00:02:35.670> right<00:02:36.670> now

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
that's one of the issues in right now

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.110 
that's one of the issues in right now
there's<00:02:37.390> no<00:02:37.750> way<00:02:38.080> to<00:02:38.140> stop<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.130> game<00:02:39.370> so<00:02:39.760> it<00:02:39.970> is

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
there's no way to stop the game so it is

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.830 
there's no way to stop the game so it is
pretty<00:02:40.390> endless<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:41.500> you<00:02:42.490> cannot<00:02:42.700> lose<00:02:42.940> which

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
pretty endless and you cannot lose which

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.080 
pretty endless and you cannot lose which
is<00:02:44.050> one<00:02:44.320> of<00:02:44.350> one<00:02:44.830> of<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:45.010> other<00:02:45.160> downsides<00:02:45.880> to

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
is one of one of the other downsides to

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.230 
is one of one of the other downsides to
it<00:02:47.460> if<00:02:48.460> you<00:02:48.820> get<00:02:49.720> on<00:02:49.840> a<00:02:49.870> wall<00:02:50.170> or<00:02:50.470> if<00:02:51.100> you<00:02:51.310> hit<00:02:52.210> on

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
it if you get on a wall or if you hit on

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.670 
it if you get on a wall or if you hit on
your<00:02:52.750> own<00:02:52.960> trail<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:54.790> will<00:02:54.940> not<00:02:55.030> fall<00:02:55.390> so<00:02:55.840> you

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
your own trail you will not fall so you

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.740 
your own trail you will not fall so you
guys<00:02:56.830> can<00:02:56.980> see<00:02:57.040> I'm<00:02:57.310> on<00:02:57.400> speed<00:02:57.790> 28<00:02:58.270> and<00:02:58.690> I'm

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
guys can see I'm on speed 28 and I'm

is 30 is speed 30 and you guys can see

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.700 
is 30 is speed 30 and you guys can see
it's<00:03:09.370> super<00:03:09.700> fast<00:03:10.230> 31<00:03:11.230> and<00:03:12.060> 31<00:03:13.060> again<00:03:13.630> I<00:03:13.870> did

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
see i'm lagging a little bit because of

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.560 
see i'm lagging a little bit because of
the<00:03:18.340> speed<00:03:18.670> it<00:03:19.060> is<00:03:19.750> super<00:03:20.080> high<00:03:20.740> and<00:03:21.480> there<00:03:22.480> we

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
the speed it is super high and there we

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.040 
the speed it is super high and there we
go<00:03:22.630> 32<00:03:23.260> and<00:03:24.220> at<00:03:24.490> this<00:03:24.580> point<00:03:24.820> the<00:03:25.240> sheep<00:03:25.570> you

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
go 32 and at this point the sheep you

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.970 
go 32 and at this point the sheep you
guys<00:03:26.230> can<00:03:26.440> see<00:03:26.620> your<00:03:26.830> trail<00:03:27.460> from<00:03:27.940> behind<00:03:28.240> and

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
guys can see your trail from behind and

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.340 
guys can see your trail from behind and
even<00:03:29.980> if<00:03:30.100> you<00:03:30.280> do<00:03:30.790> this<00:03:31.000> you<00:03:31.600> will<00:03:31.630> still<00:03:32.140> be

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
even if you do this you will still be

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
happen you live in the ship will be just

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.140 
happen you live in the ship will be just
walking<00:03:44.080> around<00:03:44.200> and<00:03:44.710> if<00:03:45.250> you<00:03:45.340> turn<00:03:45.490> around<00:03:45.670> it

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
walking around and if you turn around it

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.180 
walking around and if you turn around it
will<00:03:46.420> be<00:03:46.540> following<00:03:47.140> up<00:03:47.290> and<00:03:47.560> if<00:03:47.650> you<00:03:47.740> turn

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
will be following up and if you turn

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.900 
will be following up and if you turn
around<00:03:48.340> from<00:03:48.640> here<00:03:49.150> like<00:03:49.450> this<00:03:50.310> it<00:03:51.310> should

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
around from here like this it should

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.450 
around from here like this it should
come<00:03:52.210> back<00:03:52.390> or<00:03:52.660> not<00:03:53.700> there<00:03:54.700> it<00:03:54.790> is<00:03:55.200> there<00:03:56.200> it<00:03:56.230> is

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:56.460 
come back or not there it is there it is

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.820 
come back or not there it is there it is
so<00:03:57.460> if<00:03:57.610> you<00:03:57.700> turn<00:03:57.940> around<00:03:58.060> like<00:03:58.360> this<00:03:58.680> that<00:03:59.680> she

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
so if you turn around like this that she

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.530 
so if you turn around like this that she
will<00:04:00.010> be<00:04:00.130> going<00:04:00.610> that<00:04:00.760> way<00:04:01.030> if<00:04:01.240> you<00:04:01.330> turn

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
will be going that way if you turn

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.340 
will be going that way if you turn
around<00:04:01.660> like<00:04:01.990> this<00:04:03.690> the<00:04:04.690> sheep<00:04:05.050> we<00:04:05.200> will

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
around like this the sheep we will
