00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
hello and welcome to Minecraft school in

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.480 
hello and welcome to Minecraft school in
this<00:00:07.379> tutorial<00:00:07.980> we're<00:00:08.069> going<00:00:08.160> to<00:00:08.220> be<00:00:08.340> looking

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
this tutorial we're going to be looking

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.970 
this tutorial we're going to be looking
at<00:00:08.900> topographical<00:00:09.900> data<00:00:10.110> that<00:00:10.710> we<00:00:10.800> can

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
at topographical data that we can

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.730 
at topographical data that we can
actually<00:00:11.340> collect<00:00:11.670> from<00:00:12.210> Google<00:00:12.719> Earth<00:00:12.840> we're

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
actually collect from Google Earth we're

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.680 
actually collect from Google Earth we're
going<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:13.920> be<00:00:13.980> turning<00:00:14.309> that<00:00:14.340> elevation<00:00:15.059> data

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
going to be turning that elevation data

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.540 
going to be turning that elevation data
into<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:17.699> Minecraft<00:00:18.570> map<00:00:19.250> so<00:00:20.250> you're<00:00:20.430> going

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
into a a Minecraft map so you're going

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.370 
into a a Minecraft map so you're going
to<00:00:20.580> need<00:00:20.760> some<00:00:21.000> software<00:00:21.779> Google<00:00:22.080> Earth

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
to need some software Google Earth

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.349 
to need some software Google Earth
initially<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.130> also<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.760> Google<00:00:24.269> Earth

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
initially and also a Google Earth

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.660 
initially and also a Google Earth
plug-in<00:00:24.660> which<00:00:25.140> is<00:00:25.320> just<00:00:25.650> here<00:00:25.890> let's<00:00:26.490> just

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
plug-in which is just here let's just

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.250 
plug-in which is just here let's just
get<00:00:26.789> rid<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:27.000> those<00:00:27.119> logos<00:00:27.359> make<00:00:27.960> sure<00:00:28.140> that

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
get rid of those logos make sure that

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.470 
get rid of those logos make sure that
elevation<00:00:28.650> is<00:00:28.920> clicked<00:00:29.250> this<00:00:29.880> gives<00:00:30.150> us<00:00:30.330> a

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
elevation is clicked this gives us a

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.269 
elevation is clicked this gives us a
grid-like<00:00:30.840> pattern<00:00:31.019> across<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.859> earth<00:00:31.980> and

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
grid-like pattern across the earth and

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.700 
grid-like pattern across the earth and
in<00:00:32.850> each<00:00:33.000> of<00:00:33.149> these<00:00:33.239> grids<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:34.079> the

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
in each of these grids is the

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.080 
in each of these grids is the
information<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.370> we<00:00:35.430> want<00:00:35.579> so<00:00:35.760> we<00:00:35.880> need<00:00:36.000> to

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
information that we want so we need to

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.990 
information that we want so we need to
zoom<00:00:36.360> in<00:00:36.510> on<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.630> grid<00:00:37.010> and<00:00:38.010> you<00:00:38.489> can<00:00:38.700> see<00:00:38.850> those

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
zoom in on a grid and you can see those

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.450 
zoom in on a grid and you can see those
little<00:00:39.149> have<00:00:39.480> like<00:00:39.690> that<00:00:39.870> yellow<00:00:40.350> houses<00:00:40.920> so

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
little have like that yellow houses so

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.549 
little have like that yellow houses so
we're<00:00:41.550> going<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.730> go<00:00:41.850> over<00:00:41.879> there<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.530> when<00:00:43.530> we

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
we're going to go over there and when we

we're going to go over there and when we
double<00:00:44.129> click<00:00:44.160> those<00:00:44.850> little<00:00:45.210> houses<00:00:45.530> we

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
double click those little houses we

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.160 
double click those little houses we
should<00:00:46.710> get<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.860> little<00:00:47.039> dialog<00:00:47.460> box<00:00:48.079> there<00:00:49.079> we

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170

desktop so one so we're going to use

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.870 
desktop so one so we're going to use
that<00:01:28.080> radar<00:01:28.950> data<00:01:29.130> we'll<00:01:29.369> just<00:01:29.579> got<00:01:29.729> an

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
that radar data we'll just got an

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.539 
that radar data we'll just got an
elevation<00:01:30.869> data<00:01:31.259> involved<00:01:31.950> in<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.159> I'm<00:01:32.490> going

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
elevation data involved in it I'm going

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.420 
elevation data involved in it I'm going
to<00:01:32.700> use<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.360> create<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.810> height<00:01:34.170> map<00:01:34.439> I'm

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
to use that to create a height map I'm

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.789 
to use that to create a height map I'm
going<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.670> use<00:01:35.909> micro<00:01:36.750> dem<00:01:36.990> map<00:01:37.259> tool<00:01:37.500> which

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
going to use micro dem map tool which

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.219 
going to use micro dem map tool which
you<00:01:37.829> can<00:01:38.130> download<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.670> install<00:01:39.049> and<00:01:40.049> this

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
you can download and install and this

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.620 
you can download and install and this
tool<00:01:40.470> allows<00:01:40.770> us<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.280> create<00:01:42.119> height<00:01:42.390> maps

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
tool allows us to create height maps

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.109 
tool allows us to create height maps
from<00:01:43.259> these<00:01:43.500> from<00:01:44.040> these<00:01:44.130> data<00:01:44.310> files<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:45.060> you

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
from these from these data files so you

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.819 
from these from these data files so you
use<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.360> open<00:01:45.689> dem<00:01:45.930> button<00:01:46.259> there<00:01:48.560> and<00:01:49.560> we're

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
use the open dem button there and we're

and that's it basically you've created a

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.900 
and that's it basically you've created a
grayscale<00:03:00.959> height<00:03:01.500> map<00:03:01.769> that<00:03:02.579> we<00:03:02.670> can<00:03:02.819> then

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
grayscale height map that we can then

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.780 
grayscale height map that we can then
save<00:03:03.810> that<00:03:03.959> image<00:03:04.049> as<00:03:04.380> I'm<00:03:05.250> not<00:03:05.310> going<00:03:05.579> to<00:03:05.640> call

save that image as I'm not going to call

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.000 
save that image as I'm not going to call
it<00:03:05.819> Scotland<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:06.660> we're<00:03:07.620> going<00:03:07.739> to<00:03:07.799> save<00:03:07.980> that

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010

I recommend just having a play around

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:48.140 
I recommend just having a play around
with<00:03:47.190> these<00:03:47.310> kind<00:03:47.549> of<00:03:47.609> different<00:03:47.760> bits<00:03:48.060> and

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
with these kind of different bits and

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.930 
with these kind of different bits and
pieces<00:03:48.359> but<00:03:49.019> what<00:03:49.950> I've<00:03:50.069> shown<00:03:50.370> you<00:03:50.400> scale<00:03:50.760> at

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
pieces but what I've shown you scale at

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.449 
pieces but what I've shown you scale at
900<00:03:51.480> is<00:03:51.630> what<00:03:52.470> I<00:03:52.500> found<00:03:52.680> to<00:03:52.829> be<00:03:52.859> great<00:03:53.250> because

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
900 is what I found to be great because

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.339 
900 is what I found to be great because
it<00:03:53.579> scales<00:03:54.030> it<00:03:54.180> up<00:03:54.359> and<00:03:54.599> enough<00:03:55.019> to<00:03:55.230> make

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
it scales it up and enough to make

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.930 
it scales it up and enough to make
everything<00:03:55.590> quite<00:03:55.889> smooth<00:03:58.579> so<00:03:59.579> here's<00:03:59.790> our

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
everything quite smooth so here's our

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.460 
everything quite smooth so here's our
map<00:04:00.120> and<00:04:00.150> you<00:04:00.359> can<00:04:00.420> see<00:04:00.660> it's<00:04:00.780> got<00:04:00.959> quite<00:04:01.170> a<00:04:01.290> lot

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
map and you can see it's got quite a lot

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.479 
map and you can see it's got quite a lot
of<00:04:01.500> detail<00:04:02.010> in<00:04:02.190> it

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
of detail in it

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.729 
of detail in it
well<00:04:03.209> painter<00:04:03.630> allows<00:04:03.870> us<00:04:04.049> to<00:04:04.260> change<00:04:04.620> the

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
well painter allows us to change the

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.220 
well painter allows us to change the
spawn<00:04:05.069> point<00:04:05.370> and<00:04:05.630> it's<00:04:06.630> got<00:04:06.750> a<00:04:06.780> variety<00:04:06.959> of

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
spawn point and it's got a variety of

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.500 
spawn point and it's got a variety of
different<00:04:07.410> tools<00:04:07.799> we<00:04:07.980> can<00:04:08.099> use<00:04:08.160> to<00:04:08.510> manipulate

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
different tools we can use to manipulate

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.960 
different tools we can use to manipulate
and<00:04:09.959> change<00:04:09.989> the<00:04:10.380> map<00:04:10.560> should<00:04:11.280> we<00:04:11.400> want<00:04:11.609> to<00:04:11.760> so

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
and change the map should we want to so

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.849 
and change the map should we want to so
I'm<00:04:12.060> just<00:04:12.269> going<00:04:12.419> to<00:04:12.450> set<00:04:12.630> a<00:04:12.660> spawn<00:04:12.989> point<00:04:13.019> to

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
I'm just going to set a spawn point to

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:16.940 
I'm just going to set a spawn point to
about<00:04:14.069> where<00:04:14.250> Edinburgh<00:04:15.090> is<00:04:15.150> going<00:04:15.299> to<00:04:15.359> be<00:04:15.950> but

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
about where Edinburgh is going to be but

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.969 
about where Edinburgh is going to be but
just<00:04:16.979> click<00:04:17.220> in<00:04:17.430> here<00:04:17.459> and<00:04:18.620> what<00:04:19.620> that<00:04:19.650> will<00:04:19.859> do

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
just click in here and what that will do

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.920 
just click in here and what that will do
is<00:04:20.010> then<00:04:20.370> when<00:04:21.030> it<00:04:21.120> actually<00:04:21.390> creates<00:04:21.810> the

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
is then when it actually creates the

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:22.760 
is then when it actually creates the
actual<00:04:22.320> mind

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
actual mind

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.800 
actual mind
map<00:04:23.009> that's<00:04:23.819> where<00:04:24.060> I'll<00:04:24.210> generate<00:04:24.419> the<00:04:24.599> spawn

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
map that's where I'll generate the spawn

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.680 
map that's where I'll generate the spawn
point<00:04:25.110> so<00:04:25.379> that's<00:04:25.590> why<00:04:25.770> it<00:04:25.830> will<00:04:25.949> start<00:04:26.250> off

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
point so that's why it will start off

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.140 
point so that's why it will start off
when<00:04:27.690> you<00:04:27.810> first<00:04:28.139> enter<00:04:28.650> the<00:04:28.680> world<00:04:29.000> there<00:04:30.000> are

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
when you first enter the world there are

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.779 
when you first enter the world there are
of<00:04:30.330> course<00:04:30.360> loads<00:04:31.319> of<00:04:31.500> other<00:04:31.620> tools<00:04:31.919> in<00:04:32.220> world

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:32.789 
of course loads of other tools in world

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:35.600 
of course loads of other tools in world
painter<00:04:33.560> what<00:04:34.560> you<00:04:34.650> can<00:04:34.800> change<00:04:34.830> the<00:04:35.220> biome

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
painter what you can change the biome

water all sorts of different things and

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.360 
water all sorts of different things and
I<00:04:39.990> recommend<00:04:40.379> having<00:04:40.530> a<00:04:40.740> good<00:04:40.889> look<00:04:41.069> at<00:04:41.250> them

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
I recommend having a good look at them

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.909 
I recommend having a good look at them
try<00:04:42.060> playing<00:04:42.360> around<00:04:42.509> with<00:04:42.780> stuff<00:04:43.050> and<00:04:43.319> seeing

try playing around with stuff and seeing

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.640 
try playing around with stuff and seeing
how<00:04:44.099> everything<00:04:44.669> works<00:04:45.030> for<00:04:45.300> yourself<00:04:45.690> I'm

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
how everything works for yourself I'm

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.260 
how everything works for yourself I'm
not<00:04:46.830> going<00:04:46.949> to<00:04:47.039> spend<00:04:47.220> too<00:04:47.400> much<00:04:47.490> time<00:04:47.699> in<00:04:48.180> this

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
not going to spend too much time in this

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.640 
not going to spend too much time in this
video<00:04:48.569> really<00:04:48.780> kind<00:04:49.080> of<00:04:49.139> explaining<00:04:49.500> the

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
video really kind of explaining the

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.219 
video really kind of explaining the
finer<00:04:49.889> details<00:04:50.370> I<00:04:50.610> just<00:04:51.150> recommend<00:04:51.539> having<00:04:52.050> a

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
finer details I just recommend having a

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:54.140 
finer details I just recommend having a
play<00:04:52.470> and<00:04:52.710> seeing<00:04:53.340> what<00:04:53.460> you<00:04:53.580> find<00:04:53.849> out<00:04:54.000> for

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
play and seeing what you find out for

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.350 
play and seeing what you find out for
yourself<00:04:55.460> another<00:04:56.460> excellent<00:04:56.940> feature<00:04:57.120> of

marry<00:05:31.979> up<00:05:32.159> that<00:05:32.340> background<00:05:32.580> image<00:05:33.000> that<00:05:33.389> the

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
marry up that background image that the

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.659 
marry up that background image that the
actual<00:05:33.960> Minecraft<00:05:34.349> map<00:05:34.530> with<00:05:35.130> your<00:05:35.250> this

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:35.669 
actual Minecraft map with your this

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:40.040 
actual Minecraft map with your this
foreground<00:05:37.039> overlay<00:05:38.039> and<00:05:38.819> that<00:05:38.969> make<00:05:39.150> a<00:05:39.569> lot

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
foreground overlay and that make a lot

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.570 
foreground overlay and that make a lot
easier<00:05:40.469> if<00:05:40.590> you<00:05:40.680> want<00:05:40.830> to<00:05:40.889> kind<00:05:41.039> of<00:05:41.099> paint<00:05:41.340> in

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
easier if you want to kind of paint in

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.559 
easier if you want to kind of paint in
roads<00:05:42.029> are<00:05:42.870> kind<00:05:43.169> of<00:05:43.669> popping<00:05:44.669> spawn<00:05:45.210> points

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:45.569 
roads are kind of popping spawn points

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:47.420 
roads are kind of popping spawn points
for<00:05:45.779> villages<00:05:46.229> and<00:05:46.380> stuff<00:05:46.560> at<00:05:46.680> that<00:05:46.710> based

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
for villages and stuff at that based

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.930 
for villages and stuff at that based
actually<00:05:47.940> on<00:05:48.090> a<00:05:48.120> real<00:05:48.419> map<00:05:48.690> so<00:05:49.460> for<00:05:50.460> recreating

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
actually on a real map so for recreating

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.540 
actually on a real map so for recreating
stuff<00:05:51.509> it's<00:05:51.919> essential<00:05:52.919> and<00:05:53.099> really

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
stuff it's essential and really

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.540 
stuff it's essential and really
excellent<00:05:54.150> but<00:05:54.389> a<00:05:54.599> tiny<00:05:55.169> bit<00:05:55.409> fiddly<00:05:55.620> so<00:05:56.490> I'm

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
excellent but a tiny bit fiddly so I'm

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:57.800 
excellent but a tiny bit fiddly so I'm
going<00:05:56.699> to<00:05:56.759> speed<00:05:57.000> this<00:05:57.120> up<00:05:57.300> and<00:05:57.479> show<00:05:57.539> you<00:05:57.659> how

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
going to speed this up and show you how

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:12.040 
going to speed this up and show you how
to<00:05:57.840> do

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.959 

so<00:06:13.050> there<00:06:13.199> we<00:06:13.259> go<00:06:13.289> we've<00:06:13.559> finished<00:06:14.129> putting

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:14.969 
so there we go we've finished putting

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:16.850 
so there we go we've finished putting
our<00:06:15.089> overlay<00:06:15.509> map<00:06:15.659> in<00:06:15.900> and<00:06:16.050> they're<00:06:16.349> all<00:06:16.559> is<00:06:16.740> we

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
our overlay map in and they're all is we

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.619 
our overlay map in and they're all is we
can<00:06:17.009> see<00:06:17.159> all<00:06:17.279> the<00:06:17.399> a<00:06:17.430> roads<00:06:17.849> and<00:06:18.119> the<00:06:18.180> B<00:06:18.360> roads

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:18.629 
can see all the a roads and the B roads

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:20.600 
can see all the a roads and the B roads
and<00:06:18.930> we<00:06:19.020> can<00:06:19.139> see<00:06:19.349> and<00:06:19.559> it's<00:06:19.949> sort<00:06:20.189> of<00:06:20.249> married

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610 
and we can see and it's sort of married

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.219 
and we can see and it's sort of married
up<00:06:20.729> but<00:06:20.939> term<00:06:21.240> it<00:06:21.569> gives<00:06:21.779> you<00:06:21.869> a<00:06:21.930> little<00:06:22.050> idea

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:22.229 
up but term it gives you a little idea

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:24.889 
up but term it gives you a little idea
about<00:06:22.619> where<00:06:22.830> things<00:06:23.039> are<00:06:23.509> the<00:06:24.509> next<00:06:24.689> thing<00:06:24.809> to

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:24.899 
about where things are the next thing to

00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:27.469 
about where things are the next thing to
do<00:06:25.020> is<00:06:25.110> you<00:06:25.199> can<00:06:25.319> export<00:06:25.529> your<00:06:25.949> new<00:06:26.219> map<00:06:26.520> as<00:06:27.419> a

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:27.479 
do is you can export your new map as a

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:29.809 
do is you can export your new map as a
Minecraft<00:06:27.930> map<00:06:28.080> and<00:06:29.069> of<00:06:29.189> course<00:06:29.339> this<00:06:29.460> opens

00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:29.819 
Minecraft map and of course this opens

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:32.239 
Minecraft map and of course this opens
up<00:06:29.939> another<00:06:30.149> dialog<00:06:30.899> box<00:06:31.139> with<00:06:31.770> loads<00:06:32.099> of

00:06:32.239 --> 00:06:32.249 
up another dialog box with loads of

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:34.939 
up another dialog box with loads of
different<00:06:32.430> settings<00:06:33.119> and<00:06:33.360> stuff<00:06:33.569> and<00:06:33.919> what<00:06:34.919> I

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:34.949 
different settings and stuff and what I

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:36.920 
different settings and stuff and what I
recommend<00:06:35.159> is<00:06:35.520> having<00:06:36.270> a<00:06:36.360> good<00:06:36.509> look<00:06:36.689> through

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:36.930 
recommend is having a good look through

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.379 
recommend is having a good look through
that<00:06:37.080> you<00:06:37.740> can<00:06:37.860> change<00:06:38.099> the<00:06:38.249> modes<00:06:38.490> so<00:06:39.180> you<00:06:39.210> can

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:39.389 
that you can change the modes so you can

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:41.929 
that you can change the modes so you can
go<00:06:39.539> from<00:06:39.749> survival<00:06:40.169> to<00:06:40.199> creative<00:06:40.800> you<00:06:41.490> can<00:06:41.699> add

00:06:41.929 --> 00:06:41.939 
go from survival to creative you can add

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:44.600 
go from survival to creative you can add
caverns<00:06:42.449> and<00:06:42.719> chasms<00:06:43.169> there's<00:06:43.830> a<00:06:43.949> resources

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:44.610 
caverns and chasms there's a resources

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.059 
caverns and chasms there's a resources
section<00:06:45.029> as<00:06:45.330> well<00:06:45.509> and<00:06:45.779> you<00:06:46.110> can<00:06:46.139> you<00:06:46.949> can

00:06:47.059 --> 00:06:47.069 
section as well and you can you can

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:49.239 
section as well and you can you can
change<00:06:47.339> how<00:06:47.999> different<00:06:48.330> layers<00:06:48.479> behave<00:06:48.870> to

00:06:49.239 --> 00:06:49.249 
change how different layers behave to

00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:52.129 
change how different layers behave to
have<00:06:50.249> a<00:06:50.339> little<00:06:50.520> plane<00:06:50.729> see<00:06:51.659> what<00:06:51.809> you<00:06:51.899> think

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:52.139

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:54.920 
have a little plane see what you think
and<00:06:52.349> then<00:06:52.710> and<00:06:52.919> then<00:06:53.339> export<00:06:53.819> your<00:06:54.120> your

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:54.930 
and then and then export your your

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.320 
and then and then export your your
Minecraft<00:06:55.319> map<00:06:55.499> the<00:06:56.189> larger<00:06:56.610> is<00:06:56.729> the<00:06:56.759> longer

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:57.330 
Minecraft map the larger is the longer

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.929 
Minecraft map the larger is the longer
will<00:06:57.449> take<00:06:57.659> to<00:06:57.779> export<00:06:58.669> so<00:06:59.669> once<00:06:59.819> you've

00:06:59.929 --> 00:06:59.939 
will take to export so once you've

00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:01.579 
will take to export so once you've
exported<00:07:00.240> it<00:07:00.509> let's<00:07:00.959> have<00:07:01.080> a<00:07:01.139> look<00:07:01.319> and<00:07:01.469> see

00:07:01.579 --> 00:07:01.589 
exported it let's have a look and see

00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:17.980 
exported it let's have a look and see
what<00:07:01.709> the<00:07:01.770> map<00:07:01.860> looks<00:07:01.889> like

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:17.990 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.020 

Oh
