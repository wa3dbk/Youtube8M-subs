and getting it out of measuring cups it
is<00:01:58.649> not<00:01:58.920> exactly<00:01:59.460> fun<00:01:59.880> trying<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.420> get<00:02:00.570> all<00:02:00.810> of

is not exactly fun trying to get all of
it<00:02:01.020> out<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:01.680> doesn't<00:02:01.979> do<00:02:03.829> the<00:02:04.829> most

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
it out this doesn't do the most

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.479 
it out this doesn't do the most
excellent<00:02:05.729> job<00:02:06.530> but<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.680> does<00:02:07.950> do<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.190> good<00:02:08.280> job

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489
