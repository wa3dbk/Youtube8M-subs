I've learned how to do pattern making

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.110 
I've learned how to do pattern making
while<00:02:25.650> learning<00:02:25.860> about<00:02:26.070> doing<00:02:26.459> ethnographies

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
while learning about doing ethnographies

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.390 
while learning about doing ethnographies
participant<00:02:27.959> observation<00:02:28.019> research<00:02:28.830> and<00:02:29.070> so

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
participant observation research and so

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.820 
participant observation research and so
you<00:02:29.459> have<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:29.700> very<00:02:29.910> well-rounded<00:02:30.709> type<00:02:31.709> of

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
you have a very well-rounded type of

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.070 
you have a very well-rounded type of
education<00:02:32.340> that<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:32.550> get<00:02:32.730> at<00:02:32.850> Cornell<00:02:33.239> and<00:02:33.480> I

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
education that you get at Cornell and I

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.720 
education that you get at Cornell and I
think<00:02:34.290> that<00:02:34.380> that<00:02:34.530> was<00:02:34.650> a<00:02:34.680> big<00:02:35.280> reason<00:02:35.430> why<00:02:35.700> I

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
think that that was a big reason why I

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.850 
think that that was a big reason why I
chose<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.360> come<00:02:36.510> here<00:02:36.810> they<00:02:37.410> seem<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.769> be

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
chose to come here they seem to be

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.100 
chose to come here they seem to be
hugely<00:02:38.299> influenced<00:02:39.299> by<00:02:39.450> what<00:02:39.690> happens<00:02:39.989> on

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
hugely influenced by what happens on

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.509 
hugely influenced by what happens on
television<00:02:40.260> do<00:02:40.769> they<00:02:40.860> bring<00:02:41.040> that<00:02:41.190> into<00:02:41.400> their

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
television do they bring that into their

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.810 
television do they bring that into their
designs<00:02:41.850> not<00:02:42.360> just<00:02:42.570> the<00:02:42.660> drawing<00:02:43.260> style<00:02:43.820> I

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
designs not just the drawing style I

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.580 
designs not just the drawing style I
think<00:02:45.000> it's<00:02:45.360> very<00:02:45.540> real<00:02:45.780> curriculum

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
think it's very real curriculum

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.729 
think it's very real curriculum
I<00:02:46.620> think<00:02:47.160> it's<00:02:47.340> asking<00:02:47.549> children<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.739> respond

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
I think it's asking children to respond

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.170 
I think it's asking children to respond
to<00:02:50.430> real<00:02:50.850> world<00:02:52.610> you<00:02:53.610> sort<00:02:53.790> of<00:02:53.820> have<00:02:53.970> to<00:02:54.000> think

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
to real world you sort of have to think

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.030 
to real world you sort of have to think
that<00:02:54.269> where<00:02:54.450> we<00:02:54.480> are<00:02:54.720> in<00:02:55.079> terms<00:02:55.320> of<00:02:55.590> culture

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
that where we are in terms of culture

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.610 
that where we are in terms of culture
and<00:02:56.480> how<00:02:57.480> many<00:02:57.660> opportunities<00:02:57.750> they<00:02:58.320> get<00:02:58.500> to

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
and how many opportunities they get to

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.530 
and how many opportunities they get to
be<00:02:58.680> actually<00:02:58.920> be<00:02:59.160> creative<00:02:59.820> and<00:03:00.329> to<00:03:00.450> actually

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
be actually be creative and to actually

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.270 
be actually be creative and to actually
think<00:03:00.810> about<00:03:00.989> themselves<00:03:01.140> because<00:03:01.799> so<00:03:02.040> much

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
think about themselves because so much

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.050 
think about themselves because so much
of<00:03:02.670> what<00:03:03.329> children<00:03:03.540> do<00:03:03.780> these<00:03:03.989> days<00:03:04.320> is

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
of what children do these days is

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.390 
of what children do these days is
directed<00:03:06.060> by<00:03:06.269> somebody<00:03:06.750> else<00:03:06.959> so<00:03:07.500> they<00:03:07.709> really

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
directed by somebody else so they really

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.460 
directed by somebody else so they really
don't<00:03:08.579> get<00:03:08.730> an<00:03:08.820> opportunity<00:03:08.850> to<00:03:09.660> direct<00:03:10.110> their

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
don't get an opportunity to direct their

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.310 
don't get an opportunity to direct their
lives<00:03:11.400> or<00:03:11.730> their<00:03:11.910> images<00:03:12.390> and<00:03:12.780> so<00:03:12.930> this<00:03:13.140> gave

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
lives or their images and so this gave

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.960 
lives or their images and so this gave
them<00:03:13.440> a<00:03:13.530> real<00:03:13.739> opportunity<00:03:14.459> to<00:03:14.790> say<00:03:14.940> something

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
them a real opportunity to say something

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.150 
them a real opportunity to say something
about<00:03:15.420> themselves<00:03:15.620> and<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:16.739> be<00:03:16.769> creative

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
about themselves and to be creative

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.569 
about themselves and to be creative
about<00:03:17.280> themselves<00:03:17.940> I<00:03:19.100> think<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:20.370> interaction

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
about themselves I think the interaction

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.430 
about themselves I think the interaction
between<00:03:20.880> Denise<00:03:21.420> and<00:03:21.600> the<00:03:21.660> children<00:03:22.140> has<00:03:22.410> been

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
between Denise and the children has been

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.470 
between Denise and the children has been
wonderful<00:03:23.310> they<00:03:24.030> trust<00:03:24.540> her<00:03:24.780> and<00:03:25.010> the

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
wonderful they trust her and the

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:35.760 
wonderful they trust her and the
relationships<00:03:27.480> been<00:03:27.630> incredibly<00:03:27.989> genuine

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.730 

a<00:03:36.360> lot<00:03:37.360> of<00:03:37.510> these<00:03:37.660> kids<00:03:37.930> are<00:03:38.110> from<00:03:38.350> a<00:03:38.440> lot<00:03:38.620> of

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:38.740 
a lot of these kids are from a lot of

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.890 
a lot of these kids are from a lot of
other<00:03:38.890> countries<00:03:39.130> in<00:03:39.460> the<00:03:39.580> world<00:03:39.730> and<00:03:40.180> that

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
other countries in the world and that

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.140 
other countries in the world and that
sense<00:03:41.170> of<00:03:41.290> identity<00:03:41.800> we<00:03:41.950> see<00:03:42.190> it<00:03:42.340> get<00:03:42.520> lost<00:03:42.820> in

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
sense of identity we see it get lost in

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.350 
sense of identity we see it get lost in
the<00:03:43.270> school<00:03:43.540> system<00:03:44.940> part<00:03:45.940> of<00:03:46.060> Denise's

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
the school system part of Denise's

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.020 
the school system part of Denise's
program<00:03:46.900> is<00:03:47.110> not<00:03:47.260> just<00:03:47.590> making<00:03:47.800> clothes<00:03:48.250> it's

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
program is not just making clothes it's

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.930 
program is not just making clothes it's
really<00:03:49.650> kind<00:03:50.650> of<00:03:50.740> helping<00:03:51.070> them<00:03:51.220> tap<00:03:51.580> into

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
really kind of helping them tap into

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.090 
really kind of helping them tap into
their<00:03:52.060> own<00:03:52.180> sense<00:03:52.510> of<00:03:52.660> self<00:03:52.930> than<00:03:53.800> their<00:03:53.980> own

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
their own sense of self than their own

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.300 
their own sense of self than their own
sense<00:03:54.370> of<00:03:54.520> creativity<00:03:55.590> so<00:03:56.590> it's<00:03:56.890> not<00:03:57.040> only<00:03:57.190> a

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
sense of creativity so it's not only a

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.560 
sense of creativity so it's not only a
sense<00:03:57.550> of<00:03:57.670> risk<00:03:57.790> for<00:03:57.970> the<00:03:58.060> kids<00:03:58.270> but<00:03:58.540> the

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
sense of risk for the kids but the

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.540 
sense of risk for the kids but the
families<00:04:00.630> the<00:04:01.630> parents<00:04:01.960> come<00:04:02.920> up<00:04:03.130> and<00:04:03.430> are

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
families the parents come up and are

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:04.800 
families the parents come up and are
amazed<00:04:03.880> at<00:04:04.060> what<00:04:04.210> their<00:04:04.360> children<00:04:04.720> are

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
amazed at what their children are

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
nighttime they may have the skills but

what<00:04:27.940> is<00:04:27.970> most<00:04:28.600> striking<00:04:28.930> about<00:04:29.230> this<00:04:29.500> in

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
what is most striking about this in

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.480 
what is most striking about this in
terms<00:04:29.890> of<00:04:30.160> a<00:04:30.400> model<00:04:30.700> program<00:04:32.010> what's<00:04:33.010> come<00:04:33.460> out

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
terms of a model program what's come out

terms of a model program what's come out
of<00:04:33.700> it<00:04:34.060> is<00:04:34.330> that<00:04:34.630> Denis<00:04:35.380> became<00:04:36.370> a<00:04:36.400> community

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
of it is that Denis became a community

of it is that Denis became a community
member<00:04:37.300> not<00:04:37.870> just<00:04:38.110> a<00:04:38.200> student<00:04:38.440> I<00:04:38.980> mean<00:04:39.370> this

enriched our experience I have come to

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.050 
enriched our experience I have come to
know<00:04:50.080> people<00:04:50.530> on<00:04:50.860> campus<00:04:51.370> that<00:04:51.490> I<00:04:51.610> never<00:04:51.820> would

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
mean the relationship is unparalleled

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.250 
mean the relationship is unparalleled
we're<00:05:00.490> so<00:05:00.700> lucky<00:05:00.880> to<00:05:01.480> have<00:05:01.510> Cornell<00:05:01.990> in<00:05:02.140> our

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
we're so lucky to have Cornell in our

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:07.080 
we're so lucky to have Cornell in our
backyard<00:05:02.740> I<00:05:05.250> think<00:05:06.250> that<00:05:06.460> what<00:05:06.700> this<00:05:06.850> project

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
backyard I think that what this project

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.900 
backyard I think that what this project
has<00:05:07.450> to<00:05:07.750> offer<00:05:07.960> that's<00:05:08.530> new<00:05:08.770> and<00:05:08.980> exciting<00:05:09.490> is

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
has to offer that's new and exciting is

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.300 
has to offer that's new and exciting is
that<00:05:09.970> everything<00:05:10.960> focuses<00:05:11.530> on<00:05:11.680> letting<00:05:12.190> the

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
that everything focuses on letting the

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.720 
that everything focuses on letting the
child<00:05:12.550> be<00:05:12.790> the<00:05:13.030> designer<00:05:14.550> everyone<00:05:15.550> leaves

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:15.730 
child be the designer everyone leaves

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.280 
child be the designer everyone leaves
with<00:05:15.940> a<00:05:15.970> project<00:05:16.450> that<00:05:16.570> is<00:05:16.690> reflective<00:05:17.140> of

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.290 
with a project that is reflective of

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:32.780 
with a project that is reflective of
their<00:05:17.650> identity

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:32.790 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.150 

it's<00:05:33.790> about<00:05:34.090> real-world<00:05:34.750> issues<00:05:35.080> and<00:05:36.070> if

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
it's about real-world issues and if

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.710 
it's about real-world issues and if
design<00:05:36.490> is<00:05:36.610> going<00:05:36.730> to<00:05:36.850> do<00:05:36.970> anything<00:05:37.240> it's

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
design is going to do anything it's

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.270 
design is going to do anything it's
design<00:05:38.110> it's<00:05:38.320> about<00:05:38.350> anything<00:05:38.800> it's<00:05:39.250> about

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
design it's about anything it's about

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.120 
design it's about anything it's about
helping<00:05:39.610> people<00:05:39.760> I<00:05:40.350> think<00:05:41.350> what<00:05:41.500> denise<00:05:41.800> has

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
helping people I think what denise has

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.970 
helping people I think what denise has
done<00:05:42.460> is<00:05:42.820> to<00:05:43.090> give<00:05:43.240> them<00:05:43.480> the<00:05:43.720> skills<00:05:44.320> and

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:44.980 
done is to give them the skills and

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.090 
done is to give them the skills and
therefore<00:05:45.490> the<00:05:45.640> tools<00:05:45.970> to<00:05:46.600> create<00:05:46.860> and<00:05:47.860> it's

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.100 
therefore the tools to create and it's

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.680 
therefore the tools to create and it's
wonderful<00:05:48.400> that<00:05:48.790> they<00:05:48.910> actually<00:05:49.090> were<00:05:49.570> able

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
wonderful that they actually were able

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:51.450 
wonderful that they actually were able
to<00:05:49.840> convey<00:05:50.290> themselves<00:05:50.860> to<00:05:50.980> the<00:05:51.070> rest<00:05:51.220> of<00:05:51.340> the

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
to convey themselves to the rest of the

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.140 
to convey themselves to the rest of the
world<00:05:52.650> it's<00:05:53.650> completely<00:05:54.250> worth<00:05:54.430> the<00:05:54.760> initial

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.150 
world it's completely worth the initial

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.020 
world it's completely worth the initial
effort<00:05:55.570> to<00:05:55.950> actively<00:05:56.950> reach<00:05:57.310> out<00:05:57.520> to<00:05:57.730> the<00:05:57.820> kids

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030 
effort to actively reach out to the kids

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.390 
effort to actively reach out to the kids
in<00:05:58.150> our<00:05:58.240> community<00:05:58.780> who<00:05:58.900> need<00:05:58.930> us<00:05:59.200> most<00:05:59.590> all

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 
in our community who need us most all

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.490 
in our community who need us most all
the<00:06:00.730> resources<00:06:01.210> are<00:06:01.450> in<00:06:01.480> our<00:06:01.690> community<00:06:02.230> I

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
the resources are in our community I

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.930 
the resources are in our community I
don't<00:06:02.830> believe<00:06:03.250> that<00:06:03.280> there<00:06:03.550> is<00:06:03.580> any

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
don't believe that there is any

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.090 
don't believe that there is any
community<00:06:04.540> where<00:06:04.870> these<00:06:05.050> pieces<00:06:05.320> don't<00:06:05.620> exist

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:06.100 
community where these pieces don't exist

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.400 
community where these pieces don't exist
it<00:06:07.030> is<00:06:07.060> simple<00:06:07.660> and<00:06:07.720> it<00:06:07.810> is<00:06:07.960> so<00:06:08.200> worth<00:06:08.380> the

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.410 
it is simple and it is so worth the

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.270 
it is simple and it is so worth the
effort

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.540 

I<00:06:12.470> think<00:06:13.470> that<00:06:13.590> these<00:06:13.770> girls<00:06:14.070> in<00:06:14.220> many<00:06:14.370> ways

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.550 
I think that these girls in many ways

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.000 
I think that these girls in many ways
epitomize<00:06:15.180> that<00:06:15.510> original<00:06:16.080> mission<00:06:16.230> of<00:06:16.470> 4h<00:06:16.770> to

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.010 
epitomize that original mission of 4h to

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.730 
epitomize that original mission of 4h to
reach<00:06:17.190> communities<00:06:17.430> in<00:06:17.880> need<00:06:18.120> just<00:06:18.740> seeing

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 
reach communities in need just seeing

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.340 
reach communities in need just seeing
how<00:06:20.280> much<00:06:20.730> they<00:06:20.970> enjoy<00:06:21.270> these<00:06:21.450> projects<00:06:22.139> and

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:22.350 
how much they enjoy these projects and

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.500 
how much they enjoy these projects and
that<00:06:22.710> sort<00:06:22.980> of<00:06:23.040> self<00:06:23.310> fulfillment<00:06:23.880> you<00:06:24.300> see

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.510 
that sort of self fulfillment you see

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.020 
that sort of self fulfillment you see
that<00:06:24.660> what<00:06:25.350> a<00:06:25.380> wonderful<00:06:25.919> role<00:06:26.130> 4-h<00:06:26.580> can<00:06:26.820> play
