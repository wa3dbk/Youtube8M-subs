is<00:01:25.790> considering<00:01:26.790> it's<00:01:26.970> got<00:01:27.150> fancy<00:01:27.659> mustard

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
is considering it's got fancy mustard

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.310 
is considering it's got fancy mustard
like<00:01:29.100> some<00:01:29.369> kind<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.850> Dijon<00:01:30.299> on<00:01:30.570> their<00:01:30.780> cheese

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
like some kind of Dijon on their cheese

like some kind of Dijon on their cheese
bacon<00:01:31.799> it's<00:01:32.430> like<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.729> bacon<00:01:33.200> cheese<00:01:34.200> and

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
bacon it's like the bacon cheese and

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.590 
bacon it's like the bacon cheese and
mustard<00:01:34.860> or<00:01:35.130> cancelling<00:01:35.610> out<00:01:35.759> each<00:01:36.030> other<00:01:36.240> and

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
mustard or cancelling out each other and

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.030 
mustard or cancelling out each other and
it's<00:01:36.900> just<00:01:37.079> like<00:01:37.170> but<00:01:37.680> you're<00:01:37.770> not<00:01:37.860> tasting

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040

dogtooth<00:01:38.820> doesn't<00:01:39.420> cancel<00:01:39.600> all<00:01:39.960> right<00:01:40.200> you're

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
dogtooth doesn't cancel all right you're
