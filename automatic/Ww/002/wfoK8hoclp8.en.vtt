on<00:02:23.750> the<00:02:23.780> day<00:02:24.019> 12<00:02:24.410> on<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.709> season<00:02:25.190> and<00:02:25.280> it<00:02:26.180> puts

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
on the day 12 on the season and it puts

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.059 
on the day 12 on the season and it puts
them<00:02:26.510> up<00:02:26.660> with<00:02:26.810> some<00:02:26.959> of<00:02:27.050> the<00:02:27.110> big<00:02:27.560> contenders

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
them up with some of the big contenders

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.430 
them up with some of the big contenders
at<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:28.970> receiver<00:02:29.360> position<00:02:29.390> when<00:02:29.989> it<00:02:30.140> you

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
at the receiver position when it you

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.380 
at the receiver position when it you
know<00:02:30.560> you're<00:02:30.709> comparing<00:02:31.130> touchdowns<00:02:31.580> but<00:02:32.330> I

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
know you're comparing touchdowns but I

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.240 
know you're comparing touchdowns but I
think<00:02:32.660> the<00:02:32.750> biggest<00:02:32.930> note<00:02:33.440> of<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:33.830> game<00:02:34.010> today

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
think the biggest note of the game today

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.540 
think the biggest note of the game today
was<00:02:34.489> the<00:02:34.640> Bears<00:02:34.850> offense<00:02:35.090> they<00:02:35.870> were<00:02:35.930> only<00:02:36.550> 19

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
was the Bears offense they were only 19

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.360 
was the Bears offense they were only 19
and<00:02:37.580> third<00:02:38.090> down<00:02:38.269> conversions<00:02:39.260> and<00:02:39.440> they<00:02:40.340> I

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
and third down conversions and they I

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.309 
and third down conversions and they I
mean<00:02:40.580> when<00:02:40.910> you're<00:02:41.060> doing<00:02:41.390> that<00:02:41.569> you're<00:02:42.140> not

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
mean when you're doing that you're not

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.199 
mean when you're doing that you're not
gonna<00:02:42.500> get<00:02:42.709> anywhere<00:02:42.980> you<00:02:43.670> know<00:02:43.790> your<00:02:43.970> past

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
gonna get anywhere you know your past

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:45.880 
gonna get anywhere you know your past
game<00:02:44.480> is<00:02:44.630> gonna<00:02:44.780> is<00:02:45.140> going<00:02:45.350> to<00:02:45.410> struggle<00:02:45.650> your

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
game is gonna is going to struggle your

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.110 
game is gonna is going to struggle your
run<00:02:46.069> game<00:02:46.250> is<00:02:46.430> gonna<00:02:46.549> struggle<00:02:46.790> and

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
run game is gonna struggle and

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.430 
run game is gonna struggle and
ultimately<00:02:47.540> that's<00:02:47.720> why<00:02:47.900> they<00:02:48.019> only<00:02:48.170> put<00:02:48.410> up

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
ultimately that's why they only put up

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.729 
ultimately that's why they only put up
13<00:02:48.890> points<00:02:48.920> on<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.400> board<00:02:50.019> so<00:02:51.019> the<00:02:51.530> Bears

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
13 points on the board so the Bears

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:52.990 
13 points on the board so the Bears
really<00:02:52.069> need<00:02:52.250> to<00:02:52.370> get<00:02:52.519> it<00:02:52.610> together<00:02:52.730> on

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
really need to get it together on

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.949 
really need to get it together on
offense<00:02:53.570> but<00:02:55.030> let's<00:02:56.030> forget<00:02:56.269> about<00:02:56.390> the<00:02:56.720> Bears

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
offense but let's forget about the Bears

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.960 
offense but let's forget about the Bears
the<00:02:57.110> packers<00:02:57.500> are<00:02:57.620> 2012<00:02:58.400> and<00:02:58.610> a<00:02:58.670> senior
