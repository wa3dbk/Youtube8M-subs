00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hello girls today I bring you this look 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.330
 It's worth it if you were asking me 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.420
 that will tax them videos using either 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.800
 the naked 3 or the new from the air to 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.139
 from the review video 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.420
 comparative between these two pallets passes 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.340
 as a series type where I'll be 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.250
 interspersing the use of these two pallets 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.769
 and I'm going to start from a pretty look 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.510
 simple as in this occasion and 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.849
 as I go on aggravating more videos go 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.740
 becoming more complex or more dramatic 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.269
 this look the perfect logo so that 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.640
 girls who go to school where they do not 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.500
 they have a lot of time in the morning to 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.820
 make up to get ready or the same for 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.010
 work if what you're looking for is 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.530
 something very simple but you want to see 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.719
 fixed but not very stuffy I'm 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.480
 fantasizing more the eyes framing more 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.039
 I hope you like the look and because we 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.750
 to start as a first step I will be 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.489
 applying for me in all my pound pair 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.829
 this time I'm using this one 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.960
 milan and now of the palette nor ops not 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.949
 is taking this tone here is between 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.420
 a pink coffee is mate then it is 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.070
 applying with this type of brush 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.520
 blur I'm going to start marking my 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.520
 basin 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.549
 I will slightly raise the color 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.549
 invading the fixed eyelid 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.260
 trying not to cover this part here 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:20.290
 of the mobile eyelid taking this color 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.000
 tattoo on tone 255 is this color 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.700
 It has a matte finish and is a 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.750
 combination between pink and coffee this what 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.750
 I'm going to apply on the mobile eyelid 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.270
 to cover the court I got to use 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.890
 This clear shadow is a matte vanilla and 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.140
 then he's applying with this kind of 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.119
 brush with it we are going to cover all the 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.020
 eyelid mobile will not stay 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.180
 completely white vanilla tone but 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.790
 as we have that shadow in cream below 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.009
 of base will be a new color 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.229
 now I'm going to use the other end of my 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.790
 brush and with this fourth shadow with her 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.220
 what I will do is mark even more my 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.280
 basin but being so thin the 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.010
 tip as the type of brush is going to be 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.340
 more precise application 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.770
 just where- according to my eyelid is 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.590
 where am I applying the shadow 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.690
 from here on the shore and to the center 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.420
 nothing else I will not take it here 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.660
 lacrimal this what will help us is 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.680
 to give more depth more dimension to 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.079
 our 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.680
 and now using the brush normally 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:26.560
 to blur 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.030
 let's continue mixing the tones 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.549
 touch up slightly the shadow of the 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.890
 eyelid mobile since right now 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:38.010
 we blinked down a little bit 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.269
 tones that we apply in the basin 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.299
 What I want is for him to be well 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:44.310
 defined this part of here with the same 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.829
 Vanilla shadow and using a brush 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.620
 loose I'm going to take little amount and what 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:51.329
 I'm going to apply here in the arch of the eyebrow 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.680
 to light up to be so loose bristles 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:55.079
 of this brush I will allow myself 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.530
 continue blurring this area here 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:00.690
 the shade light pink coffee that we apply 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.610
 in the beginning now I'm going to teach my 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.709
 tabs like when I counted I already did 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.690
 the upper delineated I used this angel 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.180
 de l'orel in black tone with the same 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.239
 eyeliner I'm going to join the top 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.640
 with the lower delineation is going to be a 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:19.940
 thin line 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.940
 and only in the last third of the outlined 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.250
 and using the dark shadow with which 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.410
 we gave the depth and a brush of this 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.800
 kind I will try to fade this 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.800
 part 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.120
 and also I'm going to extend it almost 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.709
 coming to tear 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.370
 and with the same brush I will be 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:41.500
 taking a little bit of this shadow is 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.000
 Pretty bright pink and just bright 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.799
 I'm going to apply here to finish the 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.260
 delineated and a little here in the 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.209
 now my lashes should apply 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.099

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:54.040
