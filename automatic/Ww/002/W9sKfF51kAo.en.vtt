00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello guys welcome back from rocky today 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.120
 as promised we are in a new tutorial 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.099
 today I will teach you how to build a sky 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.170
 personal blog then guys 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.130
 first created a new world and it 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.920
 call as you like 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.619
 then went to mode and set the 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.359
 its creative mode then difficulty 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.340
 easy and texture package to yours 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.990
 enjoy matches online if you want 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.269
 play with friends then go 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.130
 mandatory on other settings 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.320
 go up generate structures take it off 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.810
 his post-destination in the super-flat world 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.920
 once that is done you can create 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.540
 new world 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.430
 once inside I recommend you 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.410
 strongly to abandon the spawn point 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.059
 because because the spam point 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.329
 you can't place lava blocks 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.040
 and which are essential to play not 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.989
 sky glock so you walk away the most 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.100
 possible and then open and inventory 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.379
 take inventory take one 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.079
 torch and a block of a block of 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.109
 place the torch and start the gravel 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.930
 to build one over the torch 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.789
 very long a very long tower of 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.159
 gravel to exceed the level of the 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.080
 clouds done that you will end up in 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.540
 this point then always open the menu 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.760
 crafting and take a bedrock block 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.439
 once took the bedrock blocking the 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.340
 place this will be our block 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.340
 lean 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.979
 then take the land blocks 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.380
 we begin to fence and give life to 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.850
 our sky block to the platform how much 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.400
 comes the platform of our skype 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.920
 you do n't have to do a 3 x 3 x 3 times 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:34.380
 so you have to branch it out in practice 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.600
 long is already horizontally and then from 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.640
 opposite side in wax the opposite side 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.640
 always a 3x3 of land 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.710
 once we have done this we ask ourselves 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.830
 of sand this time we will replace 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.320
 one for each center enters for three then 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.240
 I liked it here here and here 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.430
 then she fences it all with anchor 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.650
 all the earth 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.650
 once done, cover the whole thing 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:07.410
 with the block of earth with the grass made 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.780
 this you will find yourself with this little one 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.910
 islet bound to the earth only with 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.190
 a gravel pylon then once 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.800
 done that we begin to build the true 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.550
 part of our sky bloc so there 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.870
 we place a case and together with the 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:27.150
 chest also of an oak sprout 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.610
 placed the oak and the crate we start 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.280
 to build and the top of the 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.930
 our sky blog so we take and the 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.340
 flour on and start 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.620
 quickly to make ours grow 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.330
 Oak once the oak is born 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.030
 we begin to fill the access of 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.080
 specific elements that I now do 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.290
 a short cut but still that 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.460
 you will find at the end of the video 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.650
 so guys the items to put 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.980
 in the house I'm here summer I leave you a 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.570
 second to focus free and one 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.870
 once done that I advise you 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.489
 really to even take a bed a 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.280
 your liking of course and of 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:06.720
 put it inside the crate because it is 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:09.660
 if you want to play in survivor if you fall from 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.010
 this from the ski block precisely responds 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.200
 net to the point of spreading that there 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.380
 initial and therefore and is a stuff 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.080
 quite then obviously because there is 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:22.080
 you will have to go back all the way or 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:24.209
 just radically the return mode 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.630
 then come back on the ski block 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.310
 boys 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.380
 once you have finished the template 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.630
 of the ski block you have to go back to the base 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.540
 of the gravel pylon 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.100
 once done, break the block e 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.320
 like magic all the guy blocks 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.989
 they will begin to destroy you come back 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.670
 on the ski bloc that at this point will be 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.989
 a real flying island in yours 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.700
 world so guys 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:48.390
 once that's done you have to come back 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.040
 on the islet and get out of the world done 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.930
 what fits into the main menu is 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.459
 moved the creative mode to 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.250
 survival mode 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:58.560
 then you do and charge 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.670
 you will find yourself on your sky 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.170
 block 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.760
 so guys the video ends here 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.080
 I always like an invitation to leave me 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.480
 like and write to my channel 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.890
 served useful status of course you can 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.140
 share it on all the social networks that 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.980
 you want and then from rocchi and all there 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.980
 we catch the next one
