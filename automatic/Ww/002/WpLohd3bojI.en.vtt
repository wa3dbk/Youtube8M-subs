00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.260 

next<00:00:48.210> possibility<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.890> select<00:00:50.879> existing

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
next possibility is to select existing

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.229 
next possibility is to select existing
regions

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
regions

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.689 
regions
if<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.510> close<00:00:54.750> all<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.079> way<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.579> reopen<00:00:56.579> it

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
if you close all the way to reopen it

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.060 
if you close all the way to reopen it
then<00:00:59.699> you<00:00:59.850> have<00:01:00.000> no<00:01:00.300> regions<00:01:00.719> defined<00:01:00.920> but<00:01:01.920> you

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
then you have no regions defined but you

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.990 
then you have no regions defined but you
can<00:01:02.340> select<00:01:02.609> everything<00:01:03.059> every<00:01:04.019> point<00:01:04.320> and

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
can select everything every point and

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.850 
can select everything every point and
click<00:01:06.000> on<00:01:06.299> set<00:01:06.869> again<00:01:07.640> and<00:01:09.200> your<00:01:10.200> regions<00:01:10.590> are

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
click on set again and your regions are

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.280 
click on set again and your regions are
defined<00:01:10.920> what's<00:01:11.700> wrong

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
defined what's wrong

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.960 
defined what's wrong
the<00:01:13.290> next<00:01:13.590> step<00:01:13.770> would<00:01:13.979> be<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.220> calculate<00:01:14.549> your

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
the next step would be to calculate your

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.179 
the next step would be to calculate your
regions<00:01:15.450> therefore<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.530> click<00:01:16.830> on<00:01:17.070> the

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
regions therefore you click on the

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.910 
regions therefore you click on the
button<00:01:17.310> calculate<00:01:17.970> all<00:01:18.180> regions<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.920> then

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
button calculate all regions and then

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.390 
button calculate all regions and then
you<00:01:20.159> can<00:01:20.400> change<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.240> transition<00:01:21.840> size<00:01:22.400> if

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
you can change the transition size if

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.080 
you can change the transition size if
you<00:01:23.880> don't<00:01:24.090> select<00:01:24.299> anything<00:01:24.840> from<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.439> list

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
you don't select anything from the list

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.760 
you don't select anything from the list
change<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.210> transition<00:01:27.600> size<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.229> changes

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
change the transition size it changes

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:29.450 
change the transition size it changes
everything

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
everything

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.850 
everything
if<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:30.119> select<00:01:30.420> just<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.720> few<00:01:31.020> bones<00:01:31.409> for

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
if you select just a few bones for

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.969 
if you select just a few bones for
example<00:01:32.250> these<00:01:32.400> bones<00:01:33.290> and<00:01:34.290> change<00:01:34.799> the

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
example these bones and change the

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.179 
example these bones and change the
transition<00:01:35.369> size<00:01:36.049> it<00:01:37.049> changes<00:01:37.560> all<00:01:37.799> needed

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
transition size it changes all needed

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.280 
transition size it changes all needed
size<00:01:38.430> for<00:01:38.729> those<00:01:38.939> bones<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.720> can<00:01:39.900> see<00:01:40.140> the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
size for those bones you can see the

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.899 
size for those bones you can see the
transition<00:01:40.560> size<00:01:41.040> if<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.340> switch<00:01:41.670> to

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
transition size if you switch to

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.539 
transition size if you switch to
influence<00:01:42.329> mode<00:01:42.570> like<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:43.189> you<00:01:44.189> can<00:01:44.369> also

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
influence mode like that you can also

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.889 
influence mode like that you can also
change<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.299> influence

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
change the influence

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.569 
change the influence
starting<00:01:46.470> in<00:01:46.590> twins<00:01:48.290> to<00:01:49.290> one<00:01:49.530> for<00:01:49.770> example<00:01:49.860> at

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
starting in twins to one for example at

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.090 
starting in twins to one for example at
the<00:01:51.149> largest<00:01:51.479> value<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.890> ending

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
the largest value and the ending

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.300 
the largest value and the ending
influence<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.270> zero<00:01:54.680> this<00:01:55.680> will<00:01:55.890> be<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.070> drop

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
influence to zero this will be a drop

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.039 
influence to zero this will be a drop
off<00:01:56.579> from<00:01:56.909> 1<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.930> 0<00:01:58.159> one<00:01:59.159> is<00:01:59.490> blue<00:01:59.759> zero<00:02:00.630> is
