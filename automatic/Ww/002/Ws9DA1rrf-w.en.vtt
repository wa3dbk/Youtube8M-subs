00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
and I'm pretty sure that got dropped at

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.580 
and I'm pretty sure that got dropped at
some<00:00:54.300> point<00:00:54.510> in<00:00:54.570> his<00:00:54.660> game<00:00:54.870> there<00:00:55.410> was<00:00:55.559> a

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
some point in his game there was a

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.049 
some point in his game there was a
mushroom<00:00:56.010> tattoo<00:00:56.309> at<00:00:56.460> least<00:00:56.579> on<00:00:56.670> every<00:00:56.910> one<00:00:57.030> of

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
mushroom tattoo at least on every one of

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.560 
mushroom tattoo at least on every one of
their<00:00:57.210> foreheads<00:00:57.469> but<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:59.090> the<00:01:00.090> subject<00:01:00.449> of

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
their foreheads but the the subject of

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.290 
their foreheads but the the subject of
the<00:01:00.660> video<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:01.489> why<00:01:02.489> it's<00:01:02.699> important<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.120> play

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
the video is why it's important to play

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.570 
the video is why it's important to play
objective<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.379> reason<00:01:04.680> I'm<00:01:04.799> saying<00:01:05.040> this<00:01:05.189> is

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
objective the reason I'm saying this is

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.859 
objective the reason I'm saying this is
because<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:06.330> dropped<00:01:07.020> 77<00:01:07.680> kills<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.659> hardpoint

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
because I dropped 77 kills in hardpoint

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.260 
because I dropped 77 kills in hardpoint
and<00:01:10.400> we<00:01:11.400> lost<00:01:11.700> with<00:01:12.630> these<00:01:12.990> hats<00:01:13.320> dogs<00:01:14.270> V

this game and we lost we lost like 10 or

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.100 
this game and we lost we lost like 10 or
12<00:01:28.710> points<00:01:29.310> which<00:01:29.490> isn't<00:01:29.640> too<00:01:29.909> much<00:01:30.060> but<00:01:30.869> we

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
12 points which isn't too much but we

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.050 
12 points which isn't too much but we
could<00:01:31.320> have<00:01:31.439> won<00:01:31.890> this<00:01:32.070> easily<00:01:32.640> we<00:01:32.790> were<00:01:32.880> just

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
could have won this easily we were just

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.300 
could have won this easily we were just
trying<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.450> kill<00:01:33.630> her<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:33.920> we<00:01:34.920> were<00:01:35.009> having

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
trying to kill her and we were having

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.800 
trying to kill her and we were having
too<00:01:35.430> much<00:01:35.549> fun<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.939> even<00:01:36.150> care<00:01:36.360> we<00:01:36.540> wound<00:01:36.750> up

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
too much fun to even care we wound up

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.749 
too much fun to even care we wound up
laughing<00:01:37.049> at<00:01:37.290> ourselves<00:01:37.380> in<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.829> end<00:01:38.009> so<00:01:38.729> I

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
laughing at ourselves in the end so I

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.249 
laughing at ourselves in the end so I
think<00:01:39.240> it's<00:01:39.360> important<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.689> play<00:01:39.810> objective

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
think it's important to play objective

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.690 
think it's important to play objective
so<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.439> don't<00:01:40.590> have<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.770> lose<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:41.159> mean<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.520> don't

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
so you don't have to lose I mean I don't

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.880 
so you don't have to lose I mean I don't
have<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.060> greatest<00:01:42.299> win-loss<00:01:42.810> it's<00:01:43.079> over<00:01:43.290> -<00:01:43.619> I

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
have the greatest win-loss it's over - I

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.530 
have the greatest win-loss it's over - I
don't<00:01:44.430> know<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.579> greatest<00:01:44.759> Katy<00:01:45.030> either<00:01:45.299> it's

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
don't know the greatest Katy either it's

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.120 
don't know the greatest Katy either it's
like<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.689> 1.75<00:01:46.320> or<00:01:46.590> something<00:01:46.770> like<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:47.040> but

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
like a 1.75 or something like that but

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.560 
like a 1.75 or something like that but
it's<00:01:47.280> still<00:01:47.340> fairly<00:01:47.610> decent<00:01:48.090> which<00:01:48.210> most

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
it's still fairly decent which most

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.800 
it's still fairly decent which most
people<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.590> be<00:01:49.710> honest<00:01:50.040> don't<00:01:50.610> have<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.420> stats

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
people to be honest don't have the stats

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.330 
people to be honest don't have the stats
like<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.500> know<00:01:52.590> 400<00:01:53.040> score<00:01:53.220> per<00:01:53.310> minute

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
like that you know 400 score per minute

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.179 
like that you know 400 score per minute
so<00:01:53.670> clearly<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:54.060> do<00:01:54.240> play<00:01:54.390> objective<00:01:55.189> right

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189
