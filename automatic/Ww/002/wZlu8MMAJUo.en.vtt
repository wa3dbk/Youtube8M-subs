transmission<00:00:36.570> in<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.410> which<00:00:37.559> means<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:37.980> has

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
transmission in it which means it has

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.240 
transmission in it which means it has
six<00:00:38.399> speeds<00:00:38.640> forward<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.329> one<00:00:39.570> speed<00:00:39.840> reverse

which is not common on scrapers to have

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.690 
which is not common on scrapers to have

here's<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.750> reason<00:01:13.020> why<00:01:13.049> this<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.590> called<00:01:13.799> an

here's the reason why this is called an

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.830 
here's the reason why this is called an

elevating scraper the elevating scraper
does<00:01:16.380> not<00:01:16.560> have<00:01:16.920> just<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.490> standard

does not have just the standard
hydraulic<00:01:18.930> drop<00:01:19.380> down<00:01:19.650> which<00:01:19.890> would<00:01:20.040> start

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
hydraulic drop down which would start

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.460 
hydraulic drop down which would start
right<00:01:20.970> here<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.450> we<00:01:22.049> would<00:01:22.200> just<00:01:22.229> start

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
right here and we would just start

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.340 
right here and we would just start
scraping<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.250> elevating<00:01:23.729> scrapers<00:01:24.210> had<00:01:24.930> this

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
scraping the elevating scrapers had this

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.800 
scraping the elevating scrapers had this
conveyor<00:01:26.070> system<00:01:26.460> in<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.700> which<00:01:26.909> would<00:01:27.119> scrape

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
conveyor system in it which would scrape

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.020 
conveyor system in it which would scrape
up<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.049> earth<00:01:28.290> as<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:29.070> would<00:01:29.189> cut<00:01:29.460> from<00:01:29.909> the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
up the earth as it would cut from the

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.960 
up the earth as it would cut from the
back<00:01:30.240> end<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.720> throw<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.170> back<00:01:31.200> up<00:01:31.710> into<00:01:32.640> the

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
back end and throw it back up into the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.899 
back end and throw it back up into the
scraper<00:01:33.270> pan<00:01:33.659> right<00:01:33.900> back<00:01:34.140> in<00:01:34.290> there<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.909> this

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
scraper pan right back in there and this

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.880 
scraper pan right back in there and this
is<00:01:35.970> not<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.630> very<00:01:36.930> common<00:01:37.170> design<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.710> see

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
is not a very common design to see

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:38.420 
is not a very common design to see
anymore

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
anymore

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.040 
anymore
so<00:01:39.000> it

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
so it

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.930 
so it
kind<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.770> rare<00:01:41.010> opportunity<00:01:41.190> to<00:01:41.670> get<00:01:41.820> up

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
kind of is a rare opportunity to get up

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.150 
kind of is a rare opportunity to get up
close<00:01:41.970> with<00:01:42.180> one<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.570> these<00:01:42.690> right<00:01:43.650> here<00:01:43.920> is

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
close with one of these right here is

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.300 
close with one of these right here is
your<00:01:44.460> second<00:01:44.940> engine<00:01:45.300> right<00:01:45.660> in<00:01:45.750> here<00:01:45.990> and

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
your second engine right in here and

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.120 
your second engine right in here and
what<00:01:47.310> this<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.820> basically<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:48.810> an<00:01:49.290> extension

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
what this is basically is an extension

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.090 
what this is basically is an extension
of<00:01:50.490> all<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:50.940> your<00:01:51.150> own<00:01:51.390> hydraulic<00:01:51.990> pumps<00:01:52.380> your

filters and your articulation system up

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.880 
filters and your articulation system up
in<00:01:55.830> here<00:01:56.540> this<00:01:57.540> machine<00:01:57.750> also<00:01:58.110> has<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.410> seven

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
in here this machine also has a seven

foot by seven inch cutting path which is

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.270 
foot by seven inch cutting path which is
fairly<00:02:03.060> small<00:02:03.450> compared<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.869> most<00:02:04.020> rivers<00:02:04.530> as

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
fairly small compared to most rivers as

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.590 
fairly small compared to most rivers as
you<00:02:05.400> can<00:02:05.520> see<00:02:05.670> your<00:02:05.790> hydraulic<00:02:06.180> lines<00:02:06.390> right

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
you can see your hydraulic lines right

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.290
