00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:07.259
 Hello everyone who watches this video in this 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:11.370
 video i want to show new knife which 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:14.360
 I finished doing this knife today 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.250
 I made this knife I did not for myself 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:21.449
 for your good friend 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.640
 my friend is selling meat 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:28.349
 but naturally he needs a job 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:32.940
 good knife well I am from time to time for 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:35.969
 I make him similar knives at work 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.610
 as I said you need a good knife so that 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.670
 well cut the meat but also so that it was possible 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.570
 good and fast butcher carcass 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:50.160
 well so that the knife was reliable sharp and 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:52.379
 quality and very comfortable and he 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.520
 such more requirements so that the knives 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:00.449
 which I make for him was steel and 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:02.359
 steel r6 m5 or easier to say as in 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:07.890
 people say 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:10.860
 quick cut and this knife is made of and laugh 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.150
 saws for fur or just used 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.990
 high speed steel 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:19.740
 In general, how do I make such knives? I take 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:25.229
 Meg saw blade 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:28.439
 and draw the outline on it and cut everything out 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.140
 grinder fully blade form with 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.470
 using the grinder, these are all the outlines for 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.259
 handles well, in general, all the blades do with 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:41.520
 using the grinder using for this 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.540
 clamps and vice also downhill I do with 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.610
 using the grinder 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:52.049
 I'm really not in a hurry and so the steel does not 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:55.920
 burn and not overheat by the way this knife 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:02:00.270
 I did three days slowly in general 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.130
 how do i form a full blade i'm on 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:08.399
 future handle drill hole 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:10.410
 I drill a hole with a drill for 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:15.030
 tiles 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:18.290
 with a winner tip but drilled 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:23.010
 all is fast enough no problems 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:27.990
 then I make lining of wood well 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.970
 can be made of plastic but this case is 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:34.950
 this time i made you 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:37.890
 wood beech and then these linings i 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.310
 stick with epoxy 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:44.040
 I'm not sticking anymore so that 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.790
 they held fast more so 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:51.630
 so that between the blade and the pad is not 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.550
 penetrated all sorts of liquids so that not 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:58.470
 there was no corrosion 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:00.590
 that everything was enough but so long 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.220
 the handle served and then it all 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:07.290
 Tightening ties 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:10.110
 like you see and then 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.450
 fully grip cover pak strong 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.860
 resin why epoxy because 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.930
 what 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.510
 epoxy dries day and very well 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.270
 it is absorbed and very good 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:25.800
 good sheeting and kinda 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:32.690
 as if with varnish it covers everything very much 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:32.690
 well, what else do I want to say 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.510
 I will naturally sharpen this sharp knife 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.030
 sharpen with sharpener sharpeners apex 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.050
 that's how you see the hem so 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:47.280
 polished mirrors well let's 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:51.209
 check how sharp he is 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.400
 I really won't check it on paper 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.040
 and it is clear that he will cut the paper 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.580
 let's try 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:05.370
 will he try to cut the hair so 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:11.220
 let me zoom in and see 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:15.659
 I have hair if I donâ€™t know 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:20.609
 it will be visible and we try it was poured here 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:22.949
 how do you see the hair he cut so 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:31.880
 let 's cut it again so let's take another 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:31.880
 I bring you closer like a piece of voice 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:43.480
 how do you see the hair cuts and it can be seen 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:47.230
 can not see you see the hair cuts without 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:52.210
 any problems so novatel is thousands 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:54.840
 take the pieces so the camera hour 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.840
 will focus 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:00.849
 that's how you see 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:07.860
 how do you see the hair cut 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:11.760
 knife sharp enough 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.760
 so once again Stavan 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:25.570
 model 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:30.160
 very sharp knife true butcher such 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:32.500
 sharpness is not necessary to well and still when I 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:36.220
 I hand him a knife he tries 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.750
 cut the hair to him but when the knife 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:44.949
 really very sharp hair 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:47.130
 climbs he was very pleased that's what 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:47.130
 you see 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:06:07.530

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:17.250
 well, how did this knife ever do well you 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.020
 look the whole process is true he is not 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:21.690
 so detailed but still i think 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.760
