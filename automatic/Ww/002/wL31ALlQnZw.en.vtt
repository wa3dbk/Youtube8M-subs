00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.070
 everything is normal in Russian 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.689
 just in the case of oil and fine 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.000
 the use of prepositions is really 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:21.130
 Canadian developers need clarification 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.580
 wanted to make the world's coolest smart

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:43.329
 800 thousand Canadian dollars and 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:45.850
 startups began to embody their 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.530
 a dream come true but the idea was simple 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.449
 why smart watches should complement 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.579
 smartphone or tablet because it can be 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.799
 independent powerful gadget in nothing 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.870

 with a wide strap someone like that 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.010
 brutal look attracts someone 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.840

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.700
 neptune will understand for at any moment 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.590
 separate from the strap and then he 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.750
 it becomes like a pager from

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.910
 works slowly and acceptable 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.800
 results are obtained only if

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.730
 this parameter is 2 times lower 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.780
 Alas, there are no advantages in fine 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.780
 it does not add 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.459

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.010
 trials of gadgets appeared yet 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.349
 several features of glory device 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.109
 and viewing angles are not perfect 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:45.480
 touchscreen difficulty with fixing the gadget 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:47.970
 and strap problems are not critical but

 experimental mobile computer 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:56.400
 and it's hard not to agree after all 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:58.440
 experiments are different in demand 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:03.370
 Is such a decision given the collected 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:06.250
 Amount up to whether it is convenient disputed 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.409
 This device has a number of very 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.360
 tangible flaws and we all have them 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:12.430
 have listed some easy 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.190
 corrected others can be corrected 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.840
 only by changing the concept however if 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.340
 based on the principle of more 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.560
 good and different gadgets 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.449
 tony pinpoint quite deserves a place 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.900
 under the sun and even likely 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:27.010
 will only be bold experiments
