00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello people today i have a very 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.990
 relaxed get ready witney for you where 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.610
 I would just like to chat over it 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.349
 because just to chat and continue 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.150
 relaxed this is a get ready with never 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.620
 for the normal everyday life so if I 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.299
 Do you know that when you are actually 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.710
 wants to make up and sits down and 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.080
 then you sit by the mirror and think 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.670
 I just want that 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.630
 be made up normally that was 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.029
 for me the case 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.800
 I just wanted to make a kind of make-up 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.990
 apply what is needed but what now 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.420
 not very noticeable and 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.309
 lately use foundation because 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.410
 I paint as pimples it had totally stupid 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.989
 with me because they are getting so dark 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.989
 and then it looks like that I took off and 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.070
 that's why i use max sun - 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.410
 foundation is not very good and with 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.360
 apply the beauty blender and the 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.450
 then do just as well 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.450
 Hautbild suits me quite well 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.550
 eyebrows, I always prefer to know 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.949
 I can actually do that with her 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.510
 leave out so in the video but I do 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.520
 for the sake of completeness still 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.020
 take a look 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.859
 just because my eyebrows are in front 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.019
 I think it's better 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.189
 it just looks more consistent 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.900
 so to speak and then it goes on 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.200
 I could just believe myself there 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.119
 not decide which to proceed 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.070
 with concealer that is also mine 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.450
 god so many new products of it too 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.250
 from mac but that's such a liquid one 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.020
 concealer I use it since three 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.369
 years the mac studio finish and was 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.750
 now give the mac because of the 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.700
 foundation and just wanted something 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.350
 Try another and find him 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.540
 To be honest, that's pretty good, too 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.250
 I'm totally happy with the color like you 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.960
 has advised me because he works 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.880
 just really good for me and there 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.700
 I also use the beauty blender for 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.200
 Apply and moisten most of the time 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.579
 a little bit and discover it too 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.710
 off pretty well and a bit 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:49.850
 the pimples also paint and 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.850
 makes everything even more evenly 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.580
 check check now 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.930
 Competing is such a thing I've got 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.040
 I totally appreciate lately 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.420
 I 've always learned that 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.920
 made but I think if you can 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.740
 mastered and I do not assume 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.440
 that the controlling can be totally 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.910
 Just model the face and me 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.190
 I am still a little bit up myself 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.960
 looking for a product that is not 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.090
 By the way , the benefit has by the way 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.520
 just flashed in the middle of the day 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.220
 Surprisingly I do not think that 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.660
 benefit hula browser so suitable for it 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.030
 I'm still looking for a product with what 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.700
 you just cheeks really nice 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.050
 and not just like that 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.420
 cheeks down the chin I do that too 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.520
 very much and what I do upstairs 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.900
 but I do that on the sleeps 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.700
 just because I always have one 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.750
 See other youtube videos it is 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.430
 really such a thing i do not know if 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.570
 you have something that makes you understand it 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:47.540
 But you do not even know why you do that 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:50.390
 then I wear a little rouge that 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.430
 always just on top of the face 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.160
 to give a little color that 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.440
 not everything so ton in sound and gray dreary 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.780
 and you know that's why 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.280
 just up there a bit quiet 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.660
 and just well blending I try 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.709
 It does not always go down that far 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.940
 because I have the feeling that 's mine 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.940
 makes face wide 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.200
 and then I use the hula branza 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.780
 again for my eyeliner because 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.640
 Eyeshadow was not like that and somehow 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.200
 but I still wanted that one 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.600
 bit i just wanted to generally like that 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.970
 make a very simple make-up make-up 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.830
 but the individual things well highlighted 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.170
 so to speak, and so I thought that was 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.240
 good as to put in the crease to 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.890
 just to emphasize a little bit 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.330
 that it's a bit more 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.330
 make-up looks, so to speak 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.370
 then wanted to compress the eyelashes 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.100
 I do not pull one on the 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.960
 top inner waterline applied that 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.810
 So it's not a dark brown kohl 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.760
 as hard as black but has such a 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.100
 certain effect already compacted the 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.220
 eyelashes in total and that was 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.380
 not properly pointed because I too 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:08.640
 was lazy you know her well and also 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:11.190
 but then such things happen you 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.580
 survived and I was also myself 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.100
 fault 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:17.030
 So kajalstift best 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.030
 top people 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.690
 I think that's what you see 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.430
 you always look the stupidest when 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.580
 you can apply kajal or something like that 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.810
 videos that is very bad 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.940
 then it started protecting and 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.470
 to rain and I started at 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.200
 to apply mascara I have him 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.760
 rediscovered the mac 3d blersch me 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.960
 white are a lot of mac products but 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.460
 that's just the three that I'm in now 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.230
 lately bought the ball 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.910
 has told me that but in 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.940
 standard range is and that is the 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:46.070
 mascara that does not love so much and that 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.600
 lethargy in general mascara if only 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.660
 I always wear mascara on it 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:53.630
 so on until the last five races short 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.860
 before the eyelashes stick so that 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.420
 they do not stick but that much 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.100
 mascara is on it and I always find it 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.900
 happen to see the difference 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.330
 also with mascara and eyes without 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.980
 mascara I always find totally exciting 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.710
 and whatever I like doing that is so 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.760
 a stupid habit of mine 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.800
 I try if for example the 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.120
 lower mascara there so a bit 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.100
 to trade over 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.540
 So you know , I'm not trying that 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.430
 clean to do but not totally 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.350
 messi but just I believe you 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.820
 It looks quite good under the eyes 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.600
 do little about it somehow 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:25.400
 I like it very much 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.020
 and above I press usually also 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.400
 brazil over and then to me by 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.720
 to get cotton swabs and that's why 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.430
 I use the black of mascara 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:35.480
 just put it in the lid fold again 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:37.810
 is waiting to blind with honest but it 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.810
 it's so 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.120
 Then I thought about what I did 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.800
 do it on the lips and have me 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.410
 On the other hand something decided on the lips 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.150
 and then came the hair there 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.920
 Every morning really asks me 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.450
 So what hairstyle I make a hairstyle 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.660
 i want a haircut i should like her so 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:06:02.110
 wear or so wear and last 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.820
 time I really like it that way 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.890
 So if the hair is just such a top 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.930
 a bit with a bit of volume 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:09.970
 are back and then try 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.290
 I do that and then you look 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.360
 actually does not know if he knows that 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:15.160
 and then you do not think so close to but 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.930
 but then you try something again 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.150
 other because open hair is again 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.430
 maybe boring then too 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.620
 some side away and think again 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.390
 about it and wonders that's good 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.590
 or is that not how many times I want me 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:29.080
 still in the hair 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:33.640
 and at the end it is then usually the case with 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:34.840
 me that I say already and have her 

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.520
 I asked as I made the hair 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.740
 just have big curlers in it 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.970
 So had hot curlers and then 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.430
 I am always bothered by this strand 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:44.830
 Settle down so it is awful and it 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.240
 is totally stupid was actually there 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:49.290
 has it then flashed again and 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.280
 but raining the world against quasi 

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:53.110
 was totally stupid actually sees it ja 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.060
 good looking so why do you make yourself 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.440
 always so in the stress but somehow makes 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.220
 You always have such a stress I know 

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.500
 not why 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:01.690
 and then I found a hairspray 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.010
 and thoughtful you know that out loud because you 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:06.400
 just such a product area and yourself 

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:08.290
 think oh well I use now and 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:11.020
 that's why that's actually that 

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:12.460
 money reggie worthy with the little ones 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.530
 strands then still stand out and 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:16.630
 a disturbing and super simple make-up 

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:18.490
 I know but I just wanted that so 

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:20.050
 a bit talk moderately easy times 

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:23.050
 by clapping with you because relaxed 

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:24.190
 in voice over and show you that and 

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:25.960
 I hope you were interested in me 

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:28.240
 Thank you for watching me, I hope so 

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.030
 was not too boring and wish you 

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.220
 one 

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:33.320
 what do I wish you nevertheless my god
