00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.890
 at least three sea lions appeared 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.900
 in the last days on a farm 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.210
 ecological near the beach 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.070
 of bellavista and the ero castro espinoza 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.230
 biologist in charge of the cuica the piece 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.550
 reported that only Monday remained 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.010
 in place one of these animals the 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.260
 which managed to be introduced to one of the 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.750
 ponds where you have seeded shrimp 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.090
 and what is unusual for the marin wolf 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.160
 marine approach these types of waters 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.830
 since it is a species that normally 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.870
 the professional lives in the open sea 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.460
 He said that possibly sailor 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.409
 fed the newly planted shrimp 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.970
 although I do not think there are repercussions 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:46.339
 would be for the company that the product 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.949
 is very small of the three animals 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:50.720
 they walked around packing the 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.420
 who stayed until this Monday was the most 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.430
 small since it measured approximately one 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.890
 one and a half meters in length the other two 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.620
 apparently they were almost two meters 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.150
 added the manager of the place that 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.769
 sea ​​lions regularly 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.049
 they unfold in the open sea next to 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.729
 breakwaters and hills so you see them in 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.380
 a shrimp farm is totally 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.270
 unusual so that person who 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.610
 they probably missed the route taking 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.430
 by new channels that connect from the sea 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.980
 to 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.810
 cardiologist said that this Monday they called 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.180
 to the authorities to help them 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.710
 with the work of removing the animal and 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.050
 that by not being trained also 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.000
 hurt him and they also wanted to prevent that 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.820
 between the conditions of the place could 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.280
 lose their lives but the authorities do not 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.900
 came to the call and is that in some 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.210
 zones to the channel where it was traveling 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.160
 the animal the level water was very low 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.950
 to the degree that it did not cover even half 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.080
 of the sea ​​lion's body so the 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.479
 fear they had was that he suffered 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.060
 some damage however finally it managed 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.680
 move without problems for 12 hours 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.630
 approximately the farm staff 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.310
 got the sea lion to take his 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.740
 road to the sea after having 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:01.790
 stayed as guests at the farm 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.790
