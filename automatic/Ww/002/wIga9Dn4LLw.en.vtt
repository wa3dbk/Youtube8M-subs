 ascending is a small tip from me 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:01:01.109
 I cut open the bottom deck behind 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:03.480

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.510
 still left with each pad 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.090
 and just put these things down 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.790
 then shake it without kinking 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.020

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.890

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.680
 the transport on the transfer market there 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.470
 was interest but now it is 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.370

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:58.220
 formally that you are doing a top here 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.930
 inside I feel that they are from the outside 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.789
 top people 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.789
 that's just one in spite of marcel 

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:13.289
 and if it's a basic one here 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:17.020
 is people then lost now 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:19.240
 lichtsteiner away at a win though 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.830
 that's like a base beck then 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.539

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:33.749
 I have not seen them I have already seen 

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:36.429

00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:38.439
 So the raffle does not take place 

00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:40.389

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:44.020

 year old Englishman plays at everton 

00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:07.659
 a rare card that helps 

00:07:04.869 --> 00:07:11.169
 that Steiner is not giving away is 

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:12.729
 a jet and bar from columbia a one 

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:16.169

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:18.999

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:24.930

00:07:24.159 --> 00:07:27.309
 in it 

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:29.349
