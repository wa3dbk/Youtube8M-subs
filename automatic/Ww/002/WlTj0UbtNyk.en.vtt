00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
background and it did the way see pretty

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:06.110 
background and it did the way see pretty
detailed

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.230 

the<00:05:06.780> black<00:05:07.080> and<00:05:07.320> gray<00:05:07.620> but<00:05:08.130> he<00:05:08.610> actually<00:05:08.790> put<00:05:09.210> a

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
the black and gray but he actually put a

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.020 
the black and gray but he actually put a
tiny<00:05:09.540> bit<00:05:09.810> of<00:05:09.900> white<00:05:10.110> light<00:05:10.320> by<00:05:10.590> the<00:05:10.650> bird<00:05:11.030> and

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
tiny bit of white light by the bird and

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.100 
tiny bit of white light by the bird and
I<00:05:12.120> really<00:05:12.449> can't<00:05:12.690> tell<00:05:12.960> but<00:05:13.260> like<00:05:13.919> in<00:05:14.550> here<00:05:15.110> and

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.230 
I really can't tell but like in here and
underneath<00:05:16.380> in<00:05:16.740> some<00:05:16.949> of<00:05:17.070> the<00:05:17.130> bird<00:05:17.340> to<00:05:17.610> really

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
underneath in some of the bird to really

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.159 
underneath in some of the bird to really
emphasize<00:05:18.389> it<00:05:20.750> next<00:05:21.750> session<00:05:22.050> should

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169 
emphasize it next session should

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:24.260 
emphasize it next session should
probably<00:05:22.650> be<00:05:22.740> the<00:05:22.770> last<00:05:22.889> session<00:05:23.400> and<00:05:24.180> he's

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
probably be the last session and he's

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.960 
probably be the last session and he's
going<00:05:24.479> to<00:05:24.660> shade<00:05:25.080> this<00:05:25.860> side<00:05:26.250> which<00:05:26.580> is<00:05:26.610> the

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
going to shade this side which is the

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:34.670 
going to shade this side which is the
equal<00:05:27.570> side<00:05:30.410> you'll<00:05:31.410> get<00:05:31.590> that<00:05:31.860> and<00:05:33.680> that

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
equal side you'll get that and that

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:41.080 
equal side you'll get that and that
should<00:05:34.860> be

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.590 

I<00:05:41.180> do<00:05:41.720> like<00:05:42.050> the<00:05:42.080> fact<00:05:42.230> that<00:05:42.620> he<00:05:43.120> did<00:05:44.120> color<00:05:44.360> in

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.600 
I do like the fact that he did color in

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.890 
I do like the fact that he did color in
a<00:05:44.630> little<00:05:45.020> bit<00:05:45.199> of<00:05:45.410> the<00:05:45.970> existing<00:05:46.970> tattoo<00:05:47.419> that

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
a little bit of the existing tattoo that

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.540 
a little bit of the existing tattoo that
was<00:05:48.050> they<00:05:48.169> had<00:05:48.290> the<00:05:48.410> cross<00:05:48.710> with<00:05:48.949> the<00:05:48.980> praying

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
was they had the cross with the praying

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.379 
was they had the cross with the praying
hands<00:05:51.100> to<00:05:52.100> liven<00:05:52.580> it<00:05:52.820> up<00:05:52.910> a<00:05:53.060> little<00:05:53.240> bit

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:53.389 
hands to liven it up a little bit

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:57.250 
hands to liven it up a little bit
actually<00:05:54.100> looks<00:05:55.100> better<00:05:55.780> did<00:05:56.780> fade<00:05:57.050> a<00:05:57.080> little

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:57.260 
actually looks better did fade a little

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.710 
actually looks better did fade a little
bit<00:05:57.620> but<00:05:58.370> now<00:05:58.520> it<00:05:58.699> kind<00:05:58.940> of<00:05:59.030> like<00:05:59.210> blends<00:05:59.479> in

00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 
bit but now it kind of like blends in

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:06.640 
bit but now it kind of like blends in
pretty<00:06:00.020> pretty<00:06:00.560> well<00:06:00.970> but<00:06:04.600> that's<00:06:05.600> it<00:06:05.870> okay

days<00:07:12.350> ago<00:07:12.620> so<00:07:13.010> we<00:07:13.820> should<00:07:14.060> get<00:07:14.210> a<00:07:14.270> little<00:07:14.570> bit

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:14.690 
days ago so we should get a little bit

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:19.480 
days ago so we should get a little bit
lighter<00:07:16.990> this<00:07:17.990> way<00:07:18.200> blends<00:07:18.950> a<00:07:19.100> little<00:07:19.280> better

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:19.490 
lighter this way blends a little better

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:29.710 
lighter this way blends a little better
with<00:07:19.760> the<00:07:20.000> with<00:07:20.510> the<00:07:20.540> other<00:07:20.750> side<00:07:21.020> as<00:07:21.230> well<00:07:28.720> and
