00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
organized much more reliable and defense

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.709 
organized much more reliable and defense
than<00:00:40.680> Bob<00:00:40.950> Bradley's<00:00:41.430> team<00:00:41.640> had<00:00:41.820> been<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.180> the

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
than Bob Bradley's team had been and the

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.900 
than Bob Bradley's team had been and the
second<00:00:43.140> key<00:00:43.290> which<00:00:43.530> also<00:00:43.800> informs<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.579> first

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
second key which also informs the first

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.090 
second key which also informs the first
is<00:00:45.239> cutting<00:00:45.870> down<00:00:46.050> on<00:00:46.200> midfield<00:00:46.620> giveaways

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
is cutting down on midfield giveaways

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.850 
is cutting down on midfield giveaways
one<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.090> reasons<00:00:48.300> Klinsmann's<00:00:49.230> US<00:00:49.559> team

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
one of the reasons Klinsmann's US team

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.200 
one of the reasons Klinsmann's US team
has<00:00:50.100> been<00:00:50.250> better<00:00:50.579> than<00:00:50.789> Bradley's

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
has been better than Bradley's

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.970 
has been better than Bradley's
defensively<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:51.989> because<00:00:52.530> they<00:00:52.649> haven't

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
defensively is because they haven't

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.799 
defensively is because they haven't
given<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.430> ball<00:00:53.640> away<00:00:53.820> as<00:00:54.030> cheaply<00:00:54.329> now

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
given the ball away as cheaply now

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.869 
given the ball away as cheaply now
partially<00:00:55.350> this<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:55.890> because<00:00:56.190> they<00:00:56.520> tend<00:00:56.699> to

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
partially this is because they tend to

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.520 
partially this is because they tend to
play<00:00:57.030> three<00:00:57.300> or<00:00:57.420> four<00:00:57.570> defensive<00:00:57.989> midfielders

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
play three or four defensive midfielders

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.410 
play three or four defensive midfielders
at<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.710> time<00:00:59.010> partially<00:00:59.820> it's<00:00:59.969> because<00:01:00.239> they're

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
at a time partially it's because they're

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.900 
at a time partially it's because they're
not<00:01:00.539> as<00:01:00.690> adventuresome<00:01:01.469> but<00:01:01.890> either<00:01:02.070> way<00:01:02.579> it's

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
not as adventuresome but either way it's

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.789 
not as adventuresome but either way it's
made<00:01:03.270> for<00:01:03.510> more<00:01:03.780> shut<00:01:04.110> out<00:01:04.260> than<00:01:04.589> we've<00:01:04.769> seen

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.770 
goodson carlos bocanegra and a gooch in
a<00:01:53.549> way<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:53.850> they<00:01:53.939> probably<00:01:54.240> aren't<00:01:54.540> going<00:01:54.689> to

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
a way that they probably aren't going to

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.230 
a way that they probably aren't going to
have<00:01:54.899> enough<00:01:55.170> gas<00:01:55.439> in<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.770> tank<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.670> get<00:01:56.850> us<00:01:57.030> to

2014<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:59.070> generational<00:01:59.729> shift<00:02:00.060> that's

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
2014 so the generational shift that's

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.480 
2014 so the generational shift that's
been<00:02:00.540> needing<00:02:00.869> this<00:02:00.960> backline<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.799> has<00:02:02.250> to

been needing this backline it has to

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.850 
been needing this backline it has to
start<00:02:02.850> on<00:02:03.060> Wednesday<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.350> hope<00:02:04.560> will<00:02:04.770> be

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
start on Wednesday and the hope will be
