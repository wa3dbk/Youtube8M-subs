I've done it as a wireless version again
with<00:03:10.100> a<00:03:10.160> lot<00:03:10.280> of<00:03:10.400> research<00:03:10.750> and<00:03:12.460> with

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
with a lot of research and with

with a lot of research and with
collecting<00:03:14.780> parts<00:03:15.110> from<00:03:15.230> all<00:03:15.380> around<00:03:15.440> the

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
collecting parts from all around the

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.280 
collecting parts from all around the
world<00:03:15.860> especially<00:03:16.310> Australia<00:03:17.140> because<00:03:18.140> the

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:20.990 
wireless set in here which is which is

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.930 
wireless set in here which is which is
called<00:03:21.170> an<00:03:21.350> 11<00:03:21.770> set<00:03:23.110> there<00:03:24.110> just<00:03:24.610> it<00:03:25.610> was

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
called an 11 set there just it was

had<00:04:14.720> two<00:04:14.900> operators<00:04:16.420> just<00:04:17.420> 22<00:04:18.109> seats<00:04:18.440> for<00:04:18.890> the

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
had two operators just 22 seats for the

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.430 
had two operators just 22 seats for the
single<00:04:19.430> man<00:04:19.549> it's<00:04:19.820> probably<00:04:19.970> know<00:04:20.630> that<00:04:21.200> I

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
single man it's probably know that I

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.470 
single man it's probably know that I
don't<00:04:22.250> exactly<00:04:22.490> know<00:04:22.700> why<00:04:22.880> there's<00:04:23.150> two<00:04:23.300> seats

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
don't exactly know why there's two seats

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.000 
don't exactly know why there's two seats
but<00:04:23.660> that's<00:04:23.840> exactly<00:04:24.020> as<00:04:24.320> they<00:04:24.440> came<00:04:24.650> yeah

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
but that's exactly as they came yeah

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.920 
but that's exactly as they came yeah
probably

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
probably

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.970 
probably
well<00:04:26.930> they'd<00:04:27.110> only<00:04:27.200> be<00:04:27.410> one<00:04:27.590> wireless

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:27.980 
well they'd only be one wireless

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.550 
well they'd only be one wireless
operator<00:04:28.340> at<00:04:28.640> a<00:04:28.670> time<00:04:29.000> right<00:04:29.480> but<00:04:29.960> just<00:04:30.200> the

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
operator at a time right but just the

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.860 
operator at a time right but just the
general<00:04:30.920> I<00:04:31.160> mean<00:04:31.250> the<00:04:31.640> DeLorean<00:04:32.240> is<00:04:32.450> now

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
general I mean the DeLorean is now

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.450 
general I mean the DeLorean is now
we're<00:04:33.080> carrying<00:04:33.290> four<00:04:33.680> people<00:04:33.710> yeah<00:04:34.220> and

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
we're carrying four people yeah and

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
we're carrying four people yeah and
they're<00:04:34.640> two<00:04:34.730> in<00:04:34.850> the<00:04:34.910> front<00:04:35.030> two<00:04:35.210> in<00:04:35.300> the<00:04:35.420> back

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
they're two in the front two in the back

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.640 
they're two in the front two in the back
so<00:04:36.230> and<00:04:36.890> a<00:04:37.990> generator<00:04:38.990> set<00:04:39.350> there<00:04:39.500> yeah<00:04:39.620> a

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
so and a generator set there yeah a

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.430 
so and a generator set there yeah a
little-little<00:04:40.450> generator<00:04:41.450> set<00:04:41.780> that<00:04:41.960> I<00:04:41.990> found

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
little-little generator set that I found

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.820 
little-little generator set that I found
somewhere<00:04:42.860> and<00:04:43.900> that<00:04:44.900> you've<00:04:45.110> got<00:04:45.140> a<00:04:45.380> series

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
somewhere and that you've got a series

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.640 
somewhere and that you've got a series
of<00:04:46.390> basically<00:04:47.390> should<00:04:47.690> have<00:04:47.780> four<00:04:48.050> six<00:04:48.440> volt

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
of basically should have four six volt

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.380 
of basically should have four six volt
batteries<00:04:49.130> so<00:04:49.340> 2<00:04:49.400> 6<00:04:49.820> volt<00:04:50.000> batteries

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
batteries so 2 6 volt batteries

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.330 
batteries so 2 6 volt batteries
connected<00:04:50.660> to<00:04:51.110> make<00:04:51.260> 12<00:04:51.530> volts<00:04:51.830> to<00:04:51.920> power<00:04:52.190> the

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
connected to make 12 volts to power the

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.250 
connected to make 12 volts to power the
wireless<00:04:52.730> right<00:04:53.030> and<00:04:53.240> spare<00:04:53.690> batteries<00:04:54.110> at

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
wireless right and spare batteries at

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.590 
wireless right and spare batteries at
the<00:04:54.320> back<00:04:54.530> with<00:04:55.340> a<00:04:55.370> generator<00:04:55.910> to<00:04:56.210> charge<00:04:56.240> them

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
the back with a generator to charge them

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:09.140 
the back with a generator to charge them
as<00:04:56.870> required

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150
