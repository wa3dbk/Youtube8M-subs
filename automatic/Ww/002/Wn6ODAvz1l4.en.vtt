00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
that the drifting just gets ridiculous

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.530

it's<00:04:55.420> quite<00:04:55.780> pretty<00:04:56.080> by<00:04:56.440> ps1<00:04:57.100> standards<00:04:59.190> is

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
it's quite pretty by ps1 standards is

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.230 
it's quite pretty by ps1 standards is
it's<00:05:01.570> so<00:05:01.840> Arkady<00:05:02.470> I<00:05:02.770> mean<00:05:03.040> I'm<00:05:03.160> very<00:05:03.700> very<00:05:03.940> used

to<00:05:04.360> your<00:05:04.630> room<00:05:05.910> simulation<00:05:06.910> type<00:05:07.150> racing

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
to your room simulation type racing

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.890 
to your room simulation type racing
games<00:05:08.190> and<00:05:09.190> this<00:05:09.310> is<00:05:09.490> incredibly<00:05:10.000> Arkady<00:05:10.540> but

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
games and this is incredibly Arkady but

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.770 
games and this is incredibly Arkady but
it<00:05:11.020> is<00:05:11.290> one<00:05:11.890> of<00:05:12.040> the<00:05:12.190> few<00:05:12.460> games<00:05:12.760> in<00:05:13.180> my<00:05:13.210> opinion

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
it is one of the few games in my opinion

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.110

at<00:05:14.020> least<00:05:14.050> we're<00:05:14.470> that<00:05:14.650> does<00:05:14.950> work<00:05:15.340> and<00:05:15.850> it's

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
at least we're that does work and it's

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.780 
at least we're that does work and it's
not<00:05:16.600> detrimental<00:05:17.410> to<00:05:17.440> it<00:05:17.770> being<00:05:17.980> fun<00:05:18.460> because

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790
