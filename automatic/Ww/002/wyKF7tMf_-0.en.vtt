00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 on time and in sequence so you can 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.090
 be translated motto adopted by the company 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:14.160
 in the process of manufacturing line parts 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:16.289
 to assemble each piece 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.609
 produced for the car that is 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.220
 being mounted 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.100
 The measure avoids stockpiling and 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:27.300
 streamlines the process, everything starts in 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:30.150
 presses on the machine with technology 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.329
 Japanese steel sheets are molded 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.070
 after suffering the impact of almost 2500 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.670
 tons 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.250
 parts such as roof bonnet compartments 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.219
 the entire carcase pass through six 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.350
 ready-made modeling phases follow 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.690
 to the assembly line after passing 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.079
 by the paint shop and painting 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.420
 the work here is meticulous in the first 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.250
 which was formerly only steel 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.030
 begins to gain shape 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.280
 are more than a thousand 800 different pieces 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.500
 skilled hands of the operators and the 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.170
 accuracy of machines that assemble 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:16.979
 jigsaw puzzle game that got its name from jeep 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:19.680
 renegade the jeep automotive pole 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.040
 fiat-chrysler produces three versions of the 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.610
 renegade the engine may be a short story 8 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.450
 alcohol and gasoline or even 2.0 turbo 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.930
 diesel 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:35.100
 the exchange has 56 and up to nine gears 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:38.579
 manual or automatic attraction can be 4 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.799
 by two and the traditional four by four 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.500
 the whole factory plant is controlled 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.020
 for computers screens like this 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.119
 shows the identity of each car that 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.430
 on the treadmill and in the world of 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.220
 equipment and parts like this 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.259
 operators know exactly what 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.700
 do the first part of the assembly 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.259
 exactly this one 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.090
 he comes to me in painting only to 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.969
 body painted in no part 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.399
 assembled and the first ones that are placed 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.049
 on the mounted vehicle we have an assembly 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.330
 divided into seven steps 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.580
 this is the first and then went around 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.440
 around 8 hours the process follows 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.300
 the car reaches the end of the line to 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.700
 do final stages and was released 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.860
 to make everything work well in 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.110
 team is essential 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.770
 each group of six operators has a 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.610
 leader 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:29.250
 Gustavo is one of them with only 22 years 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.740
 student of production engineering knows 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.890
 responsible for coordinating people 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.900
 and gives an example of hard work 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.660
 here is really the first one job 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.640
 agent has a better team built 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.130
 by the group effected worldwide 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.840
 then the economy of the operators that this 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.180
 work is perfect 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.670
 is the operational state they 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.350
 make a place that is conducive to it 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.050
 do that particular function 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.959
 The determination of leaders is reflected in the 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.600
 which is based on the quality of the 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:03.120
 production and the result could not be 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.950
 other and after going through all 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.590
 those machines and at the hands of 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.680
 the process ends in this step. 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.170
 renegade chip is ready after passing 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.400
 by a series of quality tests will 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.920
 to win the streets 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.860
 these get together with the others I reneged 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.830
 says that for now occupy the patio but 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.540
 concessionaires already have a certain destination 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.060
 scattered throughout the country 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.519
 but here in the state the new car of the jeep 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.310
 will also win the whole world america 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:35.940
 latina is ready to receive the most 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:39.090
 of 250 thousand vehicles that will go straight 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.790
 of goiÃ¢nia with seal of quality and a 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.120
 little pernambuco in each kilometer 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.120
 wheeled
