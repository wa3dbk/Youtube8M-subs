00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
does it with pedal assist only there's

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.600 
does it with pedal assist only there's
no<00:00:39.300> throttle<00:00:39.989> on<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.469> handlebar<00:00:40.860> there's<00:00:41.489> no

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
no throttle on the handlebar there's no

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.250 
no throttle on the handlebar there's no
twist<00:00:41.879> grip<00:00:42.059> or<00:00:42.390> thumb<00:00:42.570> throttle<00:00:42.989> or<00:00:43.050> anything

assist and then also a recoup one and a
recoup<00:04:00.720> -<00:04:00.989> and<00:04:01.260> what<00:04:01.920> those<00:04:02.070> recuperation

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
recoup - and what those recuperation

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.509 
recoup - and what those recuperation
modes<00:04:03.060> are<00:04:03.329> is<00:04:03.510> basically<00:04:04.440> turns<00:04:04.829> the<00:04:05.130> motor

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
modes are is basically turns the motor

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.240 
modes are is basically turns the motor
into<00:04:06.180> a<00:04:06.209> generator<00:04:06.750> to<00:04:07.290> put<00:04:07.470> some<00:04:07.620> energy<00:04:07.980> back

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
into a generator to put some energy back

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.520 
into a generator to put some energy back
into<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.730> battery<00:04:09.390> pack<00:04:09.630> so<00:04:09.930> it's<00:04:10.230> basically

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
into the battery pack so it's basically

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.430 
into the battery pack so it's basically
recharging<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.670> battery<00:04:11.970> pack<00:04:12.209> and<00:04:12.540> where

goes to recoup to and basically it's

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.330 
goes to recoup to and basically it's
just<00:04:34.139> activating<00:04:34.770> that<00:04:34.889> system

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
just activating that system
