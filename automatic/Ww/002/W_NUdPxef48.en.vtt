00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.519
 well it's him and a half I hope that 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.440
 you're fine so we end up for 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:12.730
 a new small sawmill so the 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.889
 principle is very simple it's going to be 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.140
 several small videos in five minutes 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.700
 chrono by doing a very kama trick 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.900
 simple so it'll be for all 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.259
 budgets we will start quietly 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.720
 by an idol is only nemo neko part 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:28.060
 in his decorating team so basically it's 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.869
 a fairly simple kraft made for all 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.150
 budgets 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.940
 so I'm going to make two or three 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.590
 years or even a little compared to hd go 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.969
 especially for that so that I went 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.140
 see video in hd but alchemists 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:39.370
 to gain a little bit of time and the 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.890
 price is too high no what are we going 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.930
 to do is we are going to craft it so 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.940
 it's gone we already bought guys 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.129
 the ja's to start we'll try to 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.629
 therefore respect the time limit of 5 minutes 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.270
 even though I think I'm doing a little 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.760
 cut the kraft time and idols 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.780
 it makes sense to me 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.920
 So, how are we doing 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.969
 alliance in fact we will start 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.109
 quietly resources 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.429
 in any case I hope this series 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:05.470
 you will like me I count on you for 

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:06.630
 put a maximum of 2 inches blue that 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:12.840
 makes me super happy 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:16.030
 so we need the captain as well 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.340
 this is the captain's heart so 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.299
 I need 10 per kraft so in 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.400
 Returning need 40 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:22.720
 so I took 10 million to know 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.049
 exactly what we invested 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.790
 a little bit much clearer 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.350
 hop then we miss the substrates 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.240
 groves even if I have on me I 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.380
 play the game thoroughly I buy all in party 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:40.270
 to really put me in your place 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:42.460
 so substrate of groves and there I believe 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.960
 that I will buy mine though 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.540
 maybe not good it's not me 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.549
 first so I need how much already 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:53.619
 two i think yeah that's 2 so we're gonna 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:56.640
 to take four are then 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:02:04.899
 hdv resources so what does it take here 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:07.680
 we need the antenna antenna up so 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:07.680
 that's 20 of the cost 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:16.920
 then co who touch me and pau 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:18.959
 ask rinne for them I rather type 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.489
 mandri does in addition a point so there 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:27.560
 that I need 10 I take in vain 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:30.420
 koki poppy who knows which already 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.150
 said plains punt an agreement that 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:39.410
 live or plains 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:42.209
 so apparently it's not here it's here 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.760
 so it's my phone alone I think yeah 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.500
 that's okay so the convent 32 next 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.180
 we're going to go kraft and all that and for 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.950
 then finish the video by putting it in 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.599
 sale simply so - 13 28 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.519
 hop I hope they craftsman 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.099
 connect so these levels 110 years to 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:02.400
 doha the 110 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:06.359
 it should be pretty simple enough 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.709
 just then what's in Craftsman 110 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.720
 beautiful super and more at a craftsman one 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.549
 so we're going to hurt may need to 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.760
 troops and the hi video available for 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.889
 idol kraft 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.819
 why it did not work ah yes I 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:22.290
 believe that I removed the private mode 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:24.829
 abbas walked anyway where there 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:31.680
 how come I do not want 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:36.000
 level 110 yet I'm stupid I 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:39.799
 no kraft and the senses I re why 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:44.459
 I cut the private good question 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:47.120
 good you to bonta so here's the same thing 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.989
 so if it's cheaper to buy 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.340
 to buy the resources and then to 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.660
 do the essences often this is the case 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.980
 so I always advise you to 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.870
 look at the price before doing anything 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.299
 it is and especially before doing this 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.739
 asus kama look good if she walks 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.989
 on your server a calculation is a little 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.639
 investing for it to be more 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.290
 simple so I crafts quickly and we 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:05.609
 is saying so right now so that's it 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.280
 I just finished the kraft we're going 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:10.049
 put that right on sale already 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.720
 practically five minutes past 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:15.660
 super fast actually does honor so we 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.739
 has invested hardly we will say 580 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.160
 million try to be precise when 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.070
 even 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:26.490
 so we've invested 580000 and we're going 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:27.870
 resell his 500 35000 so what does 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.490
 exactly we will take the calculator 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.210
 a specific being still not to do the 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.430
 half things 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:38.520
 so five hundred thirty five thousand times 2 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:42.540
 which is 1m to 70 miles 1 thousand nine 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.680
 one hundred and ten thousand months plus the friend putting 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.160
 on sale will come 600 me 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.230
 of investments which makes 470 miles 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.310
 kama of profits so here we begin 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.750
 quietly with five hundred thousand 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.970
 camatte benefits plus it's a 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.690
 idol who by an idol forgiveness that leaves 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.250
 still pretty good 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.200
 so in any case think of putting a 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.120
 maximum of like for that's the beginning of 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.020
 this new series and we are therefore 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.020
 very soon hi to all
