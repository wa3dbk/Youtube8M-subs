00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:06.400
 hi hello killion i hope you are 

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:08.590
 pretty good and I already have my voice okay so 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:12.669
 that is pretty cool I'm back 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.570
 to make more videos and good I know that 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:16.900
 many of us have been waiting 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.789
 impatiently version 0 points 9.0 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.160
 since they added more blocks and 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.380
 several things and good today is the 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.490
 today I do not know why you work for me 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:30.910
 something my language that I bring you a mod that 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.980
 It will allow us to feel a little more 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.980
 closer and closer to this new version 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.440
 0.9 point zero and good first of all 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.770
 let's go with the installation tutorial 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.510
 because it's a little more specific ok 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.700
 in the description I will leave the link to 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:49.540
 where will they download what is a file 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.320
 zip that I have around here here is there 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.079
 more blogs 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.440
 al files ok let's see what it has 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:59.270
 inside another folder and good in what 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.540
 that here even says why it 's because 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.950
 who is made by dark toxic game and 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.020
 well you also need what is a 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.630
 texture and we also have what is a 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.860
 world generator folder here come 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.950
 the instructions but obviously good 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.830
 I'll tell you, you should put all the 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:20.570
 that are point xtra or are from cité de 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:24.410
 Little granite and rooms on all those 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.149
 they should put in the root is indicate 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.850
 that would be where all these are 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.170
 folders like with the world generator 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.570
 If you have already seen the video and if you do not 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.840
 I suggest you see it and well here 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:39.619
 we would have and also good I do not know if 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.259
 have seen there was also another other mode 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:45.410
 apart from this one here was this 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:48.259
 of the world's generator for what is that 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:52.600
 good so that when generating a world 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:56.630
 new all those new soles rather 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.190
 blocks names are generated in the world and 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.990
 we can get them 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.180
 let's go to this part 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.210
 perfect do not leave do not see do not see the 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.000
 secret the secret is secret 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.430
 the lie ok and good this mod adds 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.380
 several things apart from many craft eos 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.380
 well not many but kraft is 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.560
 interesting and good at first we can 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.380
 see here these blocks that would be the 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.390
 quartz envelopes that is no longer 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.610
 necessary to make the reactor at mnr to 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.440
 to be able to get the quartz but to 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.269
 will generate in the worlds that are generated 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.890
 activating the two bikes that we have in 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:37.140
 this part of here would be by blogs and the 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.630
 generator of the box world to 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.910
 activate them and generate a new world 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.910
 would these generate these envelopes of 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.390
 quartz and also apart would be generated 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.400
 others more and good 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.440
 to say others more I mean with the 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.510
 that are on this side first we have 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.300
 the north would be this one that will be generated and 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.959
 would be generated in the world and good here 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:03.500
 it's like the processed I do not know how 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.450
 call it equal diory but it also 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.340
 would generate what is the andés and you that is 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.620
 a little bit darker and this either as 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.330
 processed and also what is the granite 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.180
 and what would these down here be will be 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:17.270
 processed or this is identical to 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.920
 1.8 pc snapshot so it's pretty 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.510
 great and good as it is that the 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.480
 processed that are the ones that look good 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.390
 good too but hey do not know them 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.820
 spoke Carlos de moya ok and good here 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.370
 we can see how it is crafted by 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:34.820
 example the land exists that would be with 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.070
 this here and after is more let's go to 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.560
 character and then to make the asón 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.239
 poly set I do not know what is poly set but 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.420
 good to do those then you need 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.230
 8 or 4 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:49.360
 to do the olite that is what 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.720
 you start practically you need what 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:56.739
 which is like néstor and also quartz 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.640
 well pieces of quartz and good granite 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:02.030
 It does not matter 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.250
 and if that is already we can then create 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.610
 these are the poly set and it's 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.420
 pretty cool and good there's also another 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:12.420
 another thing that adds 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:15.330
 with him with this mode I think that even 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.250
 they saw it here we have it the door 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.290
 trap when the trap of 'iron that 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.090
 It would be this one here and it works a lot 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.100
 curious the weird thing is that you can only 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.770
 see yourself on that side and nothing already 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.980
 teach the other rays and good too 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:32.610
 add another block that would be the 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:34.620
 redstone that we have here and it is also 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:38.370
 something that I really liked and that also 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.770
 added is that you can try there's no 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.680
 Suddenly I get a cock no no no 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:46.320
 a rooster comes out but very rare and also what 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.630
 What we can do is ink the 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.760
 woods for example look here in red 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.190
 but I like it or yellow so I know 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:56.669
 is Maria here is the also but 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:05:00.000
 I want it, Rosita, this is what I want 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:01.320
 purple is what left it so red or see 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 you can also this color if you also 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.500
 can coffee and good can be 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.350
 any color any dye that 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.960
 we can have the same with 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.270
 these stone blocks we can also 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.039
 change the color without any problem and 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.139
 like these brick blocks 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:18.150
 Well, I call him that brick 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:20.789
 and it also works without any problem 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.469
 just like the berries and the block of 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:24.779
 quartz these are quartz blocks that 

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:27.270
 you can also paint and there is no 

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:29.340
 problem that 's a very good I do not know 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.469
 that should add it to minecraft to 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:35.249
 minecraft from pc at least to minecraft 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:37.949
 and because it's funny and I did not like that 

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:41.939
 so there is what this mod goes 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:43.650
 the truth that the friend looked and 

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:45.960
 good and remember to use the 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.479
 texture that also comes in the file 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.520
 zip and nothing in itself this would be all of this 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:51.870
 I hope you liked it, no 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.689
 forget to subscribe if you have not yet 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.969
 made a comment and we will see in 

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:59.479
 a next video so nothing until 

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:59.479
 then wow
