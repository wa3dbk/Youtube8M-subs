00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
notice how the spell on the player's

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.630 
notice how the spell on the player's
hand<00:01:23.420> is<00:01:23.810> actually<00:01:23.960> getting<00:01:24.500> bigger<00:01:24.650> as<00:01:24.979> the

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
hand is actually getting bigger as the

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:56.280 
hand is actually getting bigger as the
charge<00:01:25.880> is<00:01:25.940> getting<00:01:26.180> more<00:01:26.450> powerful

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.600 

lastly<00:01:57.290> I'll<00:01:57.590> try<00:01:57.800> this<00:01:57.860> out<00:01:58.190> with<00:01:58.220> a

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
lastly I'll try this out with a

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.060 
lastly I'll try this out with a
conjuration<00:01:59.330> spell<00:01:59.570> namely<00:02:00.170> bounce<00:02:00.440> sword

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
conjuration spell namely bounce sword

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.030 
conjuration spell namely bounce sword
so<00:02:01.880> typically<00:02:02.450> bound<00:02:02.900> sword<00:02:03.230> lasts<00:02:03.800> for

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
so typically bound sword lasts for

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.320 
so typically bound sword lasts for
around<00:02:04.660> 120<00:02:05.660> seconds<00:02:06.140> with<00:02:07.100> spell<00:02:07.820> charging

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
around 120 seconds with spell charging

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.630 
around 120 seconds with spell charging
you<00:02:08.509> can<00:02:08.690> make<00:02:08.840> this<00:02:08.990> last<00:02:09.259> for<00:02:09.590> quite<00:02:10.250> a<00:02:10.340> bit

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
you can make this last for quite a bit

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:26.390 
you can make this last for quite a bit
longer<00:02:10.880> as<00:02:11.360> I'll<00:02:12.230> show<00:02:12.260> you<00:02:12.470> in<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.710> video

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.500 

so<00:02:27.400> there<00:02:27.730> you<00:02:27.760> have<00:02:27.849> it

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
so there you have it

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.559
