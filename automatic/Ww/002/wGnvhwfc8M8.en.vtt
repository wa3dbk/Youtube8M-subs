00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
the Dark Knight Batman right from the

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.990 
the Dark Knight Batman right from the
very<00:03:11.470> beginning<00:03:11.950> that<00:03:11.980> I<00:03:12.130> saw<00:03:12.459> it<00:03:12.519> in<00:03:12.760> pictures

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
very beginning that I saw it in pictures

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.809 
very beginning that I saw it in pictures
I<00:03:13.180> don't<00:03:13.750> like<00:03:14.079> the<00:03:14.260> armor<00:03:14.590> it's<00:03:14.739> just<00:03:14.980> the

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
I don't like the armor it's just the

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.240 
I don't like the armor it's just the
discoloration<00:03:16.329> where<00:03:16.989> it's<00:03:17.170> got<00:03:17.349> I<00:03:17.680> know<00:03:17.860> it's

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
discoloration where it's got I know it's

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.020 
discoloration where it's got I know it's
supposed<00:03:18.430> to<00:03:18.579> be<00:03:18.640> more<00:03:18.849> of<00:03:18.940> a<00:03:19.000> SWOT<00:03:19.510> kind<00:03:19.930> of<00:03:21.030> I

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
supposed to be more of a SWOT kind of I

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.880 
supposed to be more of a SWOT kind of I
don't<00:03:22.870> know<00:03:22.930> what<00:03:23.140> I<00:03:23.170> came<00:03:23.380> or<00:03:23.650> what<00:03:23.769> they

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
don't know what I came or what they

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.819 
don't know what I came or what they
called<00:03:24.130> it<00:03:24.280> but<00:03:25.049> so<00:03:26.049> it<00:03:26.170> makes<00:03:26.319> more<00:03:26.530> sense

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
called it but so it makes more sense

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.530 
called it but so it makes more sense
that<00:03:26.920> it<00:03:27.130> is<00:03:27.160> different<00:03:27.640> colors<00:03:27.760> but<00:03:28.150> I<00:03:28.180> like

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
that it is different colors but I like

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.780 
that it is different colors but I like
the<00:03:28.900> original<00:03:29.410> Batman<00:03:29.650> armor<00:03:30.280> even<00:03:30.670> though

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
the original Batman armor even though

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.930 
the original Batman armor even though
it's<00:03:30.940> more<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.299> bulky<00:03:31.980> latex<00:03:32.980> I<00:03:33.280> just<00:03:33.819> like

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
it's more the bulky latex I just like

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.300 
it's more the bulky latex I just like
the<00:03:34.060> fact<00:03:34.269> that<00:03:34.360> it's<00:03:34.569> more<00:03:34.810> of<00:03:34.930> like<00:03:35.470> a<00:03:35.920> black

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
the fact that it's more of like a black

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.580 
the fact that it's more of like a black
all<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:36.819> way<00:03:36.940> through<00:03:37.360> and<00:03:37.599> it<00:03:37.989> doesn't<00:03:38.380> have

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
all the way through and it doesn't have

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.180 
all the way through and it doesn't have
as<00:03:38.890> many<00:03:39.069> of<00:03:39.310> these<00:03:39.430> I<00:03:40.530> don't<00:03:41.530> know<00:03:41.709> you<00:03:41.799> know<00:03:41.980> I

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
as many of these I don't know you know I

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.770 
as many of these I don't know you know I
think<00:03:42.489> my<00:03:42.730> biggest<00:03:42.970> problem<00:03:43.389> is<00:03:43.420> it<00:03:43.600> takes

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
think my biggest problem is it takes

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.479 
think my biggest problem is it takes
away<00:03:43.900> from<00:03:44.019> the<00:03:44.260> bat<00:03:44.410> logo<00:03:44.829> it's<00:03:44.980> hard<00:03:45.220> to<00:03:45.310> kind

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
away from the bat logo it's hard to kind

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:46.890 
away from the bat logo it's hard to kind
of<00:03:45.519> see<00:03:45.700> the<00:03:45.790> bat<00:03:45.940> logo<00:03:46.329> with<00:03:46.450> all<00:03:46.600> this<00:03:46.720> other

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
of see the bat logo with all this other

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.390 
of see the bat logo with all this other
stuff<00:03:47.230> that's<00:03:48.040> going<00:03:48.310> on<00:03:48.930> I<00:03:50.040> also<00:03:51.040> didn't<00:03:51.340> like

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
stuff that's going on I also didn't like

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.800 
stuff that's going on I also didn't like
the<00:03:51.519> fact<00:03:51.790> that<00:03:52.030> his<00:03:52.260> his<00:03:53.260> head<00:03:54.780> was<00:03:55.780> a

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
the fact that his his head was a

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.660 
the fact that his his head was a
separate<00:03:56.260> piece<00:03:56.530> from<00:03:56.739> the<00:03:56.950> neck<00:03:57.190> of<00:03:57.370> the<00:03:57.459> cowl

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
separate piece from the neck of the cowl

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.479 
separate piece from the neck of the cowl
of<00:03:57.970> course<00:03:58.269> it<00:03:58.420> makes<00:03:58.600> sense<00:03:58.920> for<00:03:59.920> you<00:04:00.370> know

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
of course it makes sense for you know

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.879 
of course it makes sense for you know
maneuverability<00:04:01.329> it<00:04:01.510> made<00:04:01.690> his<00:04:01.870> he<00:04:02.650> could

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:02.889 
maneuverability it made his he could

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:05.670 
maneuverability it made his he could
turn<00:04:03.220> his<00:04:03.280> head<00:04:03.579> a<00:04:03.639> little<00:04:03.850> easier<00:04:04.329> and<00:04:04.680> you

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
turn his head a little easier and you

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.370 
turn his head a little easier and you
know<00:04:06.090> but<00:04:07.090> I<00:04:07.120> mean<00:04:07.359> it's<00:04:07.540> small<00:04:07.720> grapes<00:04:08.139> it's

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
know but I mean it's small grapes it's

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.559 
know but I mean it's small grapes it's

you<00:06:38.860> know<00:06:38.979> some<00:06:39.010> of<00:06:39.400> the<00:06:39.490> variations<00:06:40.270> in<00:06:40.389> the

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:40.510 
you know some of the variations in the

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:42.930 
you know some of the variations in the
Joker<00:06:40.810> and<00:06:40.990> especially<00:06:41.830> some<00:06:42.190> variations<00:06:42.789> in

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:42.940 
Joker and especially some variations in

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.170 
Joker and especially some variations in
the<00:06:43.030> Batman<00:06:44.760> certainly<00:06:45.760> if<00:06:45.880> you<00:06:46.000> have<00:06:46.030> a

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:46.180 
the Batman certainly if you have a

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.570 
the Batman certainly if you have a
variant<00:06:46.780> Batman<00:06:47.260> with<00:06:47.500> the<00:06:47.650> Bruce<00:06:47.950> Wayne<00:06:48.160> head

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:48.580 
variant Batman with the Bruce Wayne head

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.879 
variant Batman with the Bruce Wayne head
you<00:06:49.270> could<00:06:49.419> take<00:06:49.750> that<00:06:49.780> head<00:06:50.260> off<00:06:50.289> and<00:06:50.650> put<00:06:50.860> it

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:50.889 
you could take that head off and put it

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:54.180 
you could take that head off and put it
on<00:06:51.070> the<00:06:51.340> Scarecrow<00:06:51.940> or<00:06:52.210> the<00:06:53.169> Joker<00:06:53.470> thug<00:06:53.889> body

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:54.190 
on the Scarecrow or the Joker thug body

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:56.490 
on the Scarecrow or the Joker thug body
and<00:06:54.460> then<00:06:54.580> you'd<00:06:54.700> have<00:06:54.880> a<00:06:54.960> casual<00:06:55.960> Bruce<00:06:56.200> Wayne

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:56.500 
and then you'd have a casual Bruce Wayne

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.450 
and then you'd have a casual Bruce Wayne
but<00:06:57.539> the<00:06:58.539> downside<00:06:58.780> to<00:06:59.169> that<00:06:59.229> is<00:06:59.500> for<00:06:59.800> a<00:06:59.860> 60

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:00.460 
but the downside to that is for a 60

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.420 
but the downside to that is for a 60
dollar<00:07:00.669> figure<00:07:01.229> with<00:07:02.229> the

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:02.430 
dollar figure with the

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:03.530 
dollar figure with the
Bruce<00:07:02.610> Wayne<00:07:02.850> head<00:07:03.090> I<00:07:03.120> don't<00:07:03.240> know<00:07:03.360> if<00:07:03.450> you
