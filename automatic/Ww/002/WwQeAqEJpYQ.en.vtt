00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
version is the a clamp version it can

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.160 
version is the a clamp version it can
come<00:00:17.310> in<00:00:17.490> a<00:00:17.550> din<00:00:17.760> version<00:00:18.180> as<00:00:18.300> well<00:00:18.330> obviously

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
come in a din version as well obviously

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.770 
come in a din version as well obviously
the<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:20.040> clamp<00:00:20.490> is<00:00:20.640> good<00:00:20.820> for<00:00:21.030> two<00:00:21.360> three<00:00:21.570> two

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:21.780 
the a clamp is good for two three two

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.029 
the a clamp is good for two three two
and<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.740> din<00:00:22.950> is<00:00:23.220> good<00:00:23.460> for<00:00:23.670> 300<00:00:24.270> bar<00:00:24.920> lots<00:00:25.920> of

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
features on the mark 25 it's first of

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.250 
features on the mark 25 it's first of
all<00:00:28.950> a<00:00:29.130> piston<00:00:29.670> regulator<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.630> it's<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.840> very

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
all a piston regulator so it's a very

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.220 
all a piston regulator so it's a very
high<00:00:31.680> performance<00:00:32.030> regulator<00:00:33.030> often<00:00:33.989> used

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
high performance regulator often used

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.740 
high performance regulator often used
for<00:00:34.410> very<00:00:34.650> deep<00:00:34.950> diving<00:00:35.250> but<00:00:36.000> excellent<00:00:36.510> for

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
for very deep diving but excellent for

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.430 
for very deep diving but excellent for
recreational<00:00:37.350> diving<00:00:37.650> as<00:00:37.950> well<00:00:38.900> it<00:00:39.900> features

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
recreational diving as well it features

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.210 
recreational diving as well it features
five<00:00:40.860> low-pressure<00:00:41.550> ports<00:00:42.470> for<00:00:43.470> on<00:00:43.770> the

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 
five low-pressure ports for on the

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.299 
five low-pressure ports for on the
outside<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.850> turret<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.810> one<00:00:46.290> on<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:47.070> top

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
outside of the turret and one on the top

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.660 
outside of the turret and one on the top
of<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.579> turret<00:00:48.200> much<00:00:49.200> discussion<00:00:49.590> occurs<00:00:50.340> on

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
of the turret much discussion occurs on

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.970 
of the turret much discussion occurs on
which<00:00:50.940> way<00:00:51.149> up<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.690> mark<00:00:51.930> 25<00:00:52.470> should<00:00:52.860> be

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
which way up the mark 25 should be

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.220 
which way up the mark 25 should be
orientated<00:00:53.700> it's<00:00:54.329> really<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.780> matter<00:00:55.050> of

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
orientated it's really a matter of

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.160 
orientated it's really a matter of
personal<00:00:55.829> preference<00:00:56.329> it<00:00:57.329> operates<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.899> same

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
personal preference it operates the same

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.799 
personal preference it operates the same
either<00:00:58.410> way<00:00:58.680> up<00:00:59.010> if<00:00:59.280> you<00:01:00.030> want<00:01:00.239> extreme

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
either way up if you want extreme

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.280 
either way up if you want extreme
performance<00:01:02.149> you<00:01:03.149> put<00:01:03.180> your<00:01:03.570> second<00:01:04.019> stage

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
performance you put your second stage

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.809 
performance you put your second stage
offer<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:05.100> very<00:01:05.399> top<00:01:06.149> of<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.020> turret<00:01:07.819> but

00:01:08.809 --> 00:01:08.819 
offer the very top of the turret but

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:11.559 
offer the very top of the turret but
really<00:01:09.569> for<00:01:09.840> most<00:01:09.990> recreational<00:01:10.740> diving

00:01:11.559 --> 00:01:11.569 
really for most recreational diving

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:14.510 
really for most recreational diving
that's<00:01:12.569> very<00:01:12.840> much<00:01:12.990> overkill<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.829> not

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
that's very much overkill and not

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.539 
that's very much overkill and not
required<00:01:14.999> it<00:01:15.899> has<00:01:16.079> two<00:01:16.380> high-pressure<00:01:17.009> ports

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
required it has two high-pressure ports

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.940 
required it has two high-pressure ports
one<00:01:18.270> on<00:01:18.389> either<00:01:18.539> side<00:01:18.929> which<00:01:19.529> allows<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.920> to

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
one on either side which allows you to

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.629 
one on either side which allows you to
have<00:01:20.039> a<00:01:20.130> gauge<00:01:20.429> in<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.759> computer<00:01:21.859> these<00:01:22.859> fins

00:01:23.629 --> 00:01:23.639 
have a gauge in a computer these fins

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:25.929 
have a gauge in a computer these fins
halfway<00:01:24.329> down<00:01:24.509> below<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.049> turret<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.529> turret

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
halfway down below the turret the turret

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:30.800 
halfway down below the turret the turret
swivels<00:01:26.939> for<00:01:27.209> comfort<00:01:28.549> generally<00:01:29.600> you'll<00:01:30.600> see

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
swivels for comfort generally you'll see

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.260 
swivels for comfort generally you'll see
that<00:01:30.959> the<00:01:31.079> orientation<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.880> turret

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
that the orientation of the turret

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.529 
that the orientation of the turret
allows<00:01:33.899> that<00:01:34.170> most<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.979> one<00:01:35.159> half<00:01:35.539> isn't

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
allows that most of one half isn't

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:39.800 
allows that most of one half isn't
actually<00:01:37.200> used<00:01:37.560> for<00:01:37.740> hoses<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:38.999> personally<00:01:39.749> I

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
actually used for hoses so personally I

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.629 
actually used for hoses so personally I
tend<00:01:40.109> to<00:01:40.259> put<00:01:40.560> this<00:01:40.709> section<00:01:41.159> towards<00:01:41.369> the

00:01:41.629 --> 00:01:41.639 
tend to put this section towards the

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:44.629 
tend to put this section towards the
back<00:01:41.849> of<00:01:42.029> the<00:01:42.149> head<00:01:42.439> so<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.529> hoses<00:01:43.920> come<00:01:44.429> out

00:01:44.629 --> 00:01:44.639 
back of the head so the hoses come out

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:46.309 
back of the head so the hoses come out
although<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.329> does<00:01:45.539> mean<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.079> back

00:01:46.309 --> 00:01:46.319 
although it does mean that the back

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:49.940 
although it does mean that the back
hoses<00:01:46.919> that<00:01:47.039> normally<00:01:47.399> go<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.700> BC<00:01:48.149> DS<00:01:48.950> tend

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
hoses that normally go to the BC DS tend

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.169 
hoses that normally go to the BC DS tend
to<00:01:50.419> come<00:01:51.419> out<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.689> bit<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:51.990> strange<00:01:52.319> angle

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
to come out of a bit of a strange angle

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:55.959 
to come out of a bit of a strange angle
but<00:01:54.179> it<00:01:54.419> is<00:01:54.539> completely<00:01:55.049> personal<00:01:55.380> preference

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
but it is completely personal preference

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:59.179 
but it is completely personal preference
you<00:01:56.969> have<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.209> fins<00:01:57.509> as<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:58.020> go<00:01:58.169> down<00:01:58.469> this<00:01:58.889> is

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
you have the fins as you go down this is

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.719 
you have the fins as you go down this is
the<00:01:59.959> system<00:02:00.959> thermal<00:02:01.560> insulation<00:02:02.069> system

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
the system thermal insulation system

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.879 
the system thermal insulation system
this<00:02:03.329> keeps<00:02:03.599> the<00:02:03.749> regulator<00:02:04.049> effectively

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:04.889 
this keeps the regulator effectively

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:08.469 
this keeps the regulator effectively

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
you see here are for the ambient chamber

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.979 
you see here are for the ambient chamber
that's<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.159> technical<00:02:23.610> part<00:02:23.879> with<00:02:24.209> inside<00:02:24.689> the

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
that's a technical part with inside the

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.530 
that's a technical part with inside the
first<00:02:25.650> stage<00:02:25.980> don't<00:02:26.730> eat<00:02:26.909> away<00:02:27.120> particularly

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
first stage don't eat away particularly

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.780 
first stage don't eat away particularly
about<00:02:27.780> that<00:02:28.019> as<00:02:28.500> you<00:02:29.250> move<00:02:29.370> towards<00:02:29.700> the

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
about that as you move towards the

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.130 
about that as you move towards the
bottom<00:02:30.180> of<00:02:30.299> the<00:02:30.360> regulator<00:02:31.010> you<00:02:32.010> have<00:02:32.250> this

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
bottom of the regulator you have this

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.339 
bottom of the regulator you have this
tap<00:02:34.140> again<00:02:35.129> this<00:02:35.790> can<00:02:36.090> go<00:02:36.450> on<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:36.689> top<00:02:36.900> some

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
tap again this can go on the top some

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.530 
tap again this can go on the top some
people<00:02:37.709> like<00:02:37.859> to<00:02:37.890> mount<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.400> regulator<00:02:38.849> this

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
people like to mount the regulator this

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.050 
people like to mount the regulator this
way<00:02:39.780> up<00:02:39.989> which<00:02:40.500> obviously<00:02:40.799> that<00:02:41.129> then<00:02:41.340> keeps<00:02:41.939> a

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
way up which obviously that then keeps a

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.780 
way up which obviously that then keeps a
very<00:02:42.359> low<00:02:42.540> profile<00:02:43.379> on<00:02:43.739> the<00:02:44.430> top<00:02:44.609> of<00:02:44.760> your

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
very low profile on the top of your

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.000 
very low profile on the top of your
cylinder<00:02:45.359> if<00:02:45.510> your<00:02:45.659> wreck<00:02:45.900> diving<00:02:46.290> or

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
cylinder if your wreck diving or

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.309 
cylinder if your wreck diving or
something<00:02:47.370> like<00:02:47.549> that<00:02:47.760> then<00:02:48.480> that<00:02:49.019> would<00:02:49.170> be

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
something like that then that would be

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.489 
something like that then that would be
the<00:02:49.440> way<00:02:49.590> up<00:02:49.769> to<00:02:50.040> mount<00:02:50.250> that
