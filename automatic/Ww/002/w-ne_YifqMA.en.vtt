as a duel disk in the front but uh most
of<00:03:06.440> our<00:03:07.060> this<00:03:08.060> valve<00:03:08.329> right<00:03:08.600> here<00:03:08.660> the<00:03:09.590> believe

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
of our this valve right here the believe

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:14.039 
of our this valve right here the believe
oh<00:03:09.980> you<00:03:10.819> can<00:03:11.180> be<00:03:11.359> switched<00:03:11.600> over<00:03:12.250> but<00:03:13.250> still

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
oh you can be switched over but still

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.860 
oh you can be switched over but still
there's<00:03:15.049> not<00:03:15.380> enough<00:03:15.680> clearance<00:03:15.980> there<00:03:16.870> too

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
there's not enough clearance there too

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.289 
there's not enough clearance there too
much<00:03:18.049> copper<00:03:18.319> for<00:03:18.709> that<00:03:18.829> wheel<00:03:19.040> but<00:03:19.760> I<00:03:19.790> figured

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
much copper for that wheel but I figured

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:25.120 
much copper for that wheel but I figured
out<00:03:20.450> how<00:03:20.750> I<00:03:21.049> can<00:03:21.380> actually<00:03:21.650> use<00:03:23.620> this<00:03:24.620> caliper

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
out how I can actually use this caliper

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:32.199 
out how I can actually use this caliper
and<00:03:28.329> on<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:30.530> rear<00:03:30.709> wheel<00:03:30.920> they<00:03:31.790> won't<00:03:32.060> look

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
and on the rear wheel they won't look

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:38.880 
and on the rear wheel they won't look
ratty<00:03:32.620> and

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.890 

all<00:03:39.850> is<00:03:40.210> going<00:03:40.390> to<00:03:40.420> be<00:03:40.569> a<00:03:40.600> kid<00:03:42.450> it's<00:03:43.450> going<00:03:43.810> to

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
all is going to be a kid it's going to

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.590 
all is going to be a kid it's going to
be<00:03:44.020> a<00:03:44.130> adapter<00:03:45.130> pretty<00:03:45.670> much<00:03:45.880> similar<00:03:46.360> the

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
be a adapter pretty much similar the

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.320 
be a adapter pretty much similar the
same<00:03:47.200> thickness<00:03:47.470> is<00:03:47.830> that<00:03:48.069> out<00:03:48.430> of<00:03:48.490> metal<00:03:48.850> and

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:56.910 

concordance<00:03:55.200> it<00:03:56.200> would<00:03:56.320> pretty<00:03:56.470> much<00:03:56.560> sit

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
concordance it would pretty much sit

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:04.800 
concordance it would pretty much sit
