00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.180 
think at the start of another word and
then<00:06:04.910> the<00:06:04.940> deal<00:06:05.150> don't<00:06:05.450> work<00:06:05.660> out<00:06:06.620> all<00:06:07.010> the

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
then the deal don't work out all the

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.680 
then the deal don't work out all the
words<00:06:07.340> yet<00:06:07.780> sound<00:06:08.780> and<00:06:09.200> so<00:06:09.500> I<00:06:09.530> need<00:06:10.210> to<00:06:11.210> strain

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:11.690 
words yet sound and so I need to strain

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.450 
words yet sound and so I need to strain
a<00:06:11.720> faster<00:06:11.810> too<00:06:12.500> much<00:06:12.650> month<00:06:12.920> still<00:06:13.160> have<00:06:13.310> too

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.460 
a faster too much month still have too

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:18.660 
a faster too much month still have too
much<00:06:13.550> months<00:06:13.820> to<00:06:13.970> put<00:06:14.090> me<00:06:14.180> ahead<00:06:14.300> too<00:06:14.570> slow<00:06:15.260> and

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:18.670 

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.390 

so<00:06:19.670> this<00:06:19.820> will<00:06:19.940> need<00:06:20.090> a<00:06:20.150> couple<00:06:20.450> of<00:06:20.690> watches
