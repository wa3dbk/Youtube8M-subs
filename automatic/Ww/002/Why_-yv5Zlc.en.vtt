 player create a developed world we have 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.069
 created 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.060
 good to start with those disasters 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.720
 lancaster natives something here they put 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.160
 his crafting table put here blocks of 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.330
 Diamond 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.330

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:58.540
 and in the center they will have to put a 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:04:02.990
 poet and that of a lava fee and here 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:05.540
 will come another lava account that is 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.790
 the one that creates natural disasters in 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:11.120
 spanair 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:15.049
 here if you put right to the air 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.509
 you can choose the natural disaster 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:20.780
 who want for example meteorite 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:25.850
 gamarra the gateway that is the wave of 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:29.360
 heat volcano monster the earth here 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:31.340
 let's make an industry and an example 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.310
 with the train monsters it will come out 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.800
 as a little thing begins as a 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.300
 drop cubes and the investors will 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.919
 chasing is as if not a monster 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.840
 under the earth and the men of the 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:45.320
 land cubes above if they want it 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.419
 destroy only stay then in only in 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.460
 skis and is not advisable that 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:52.060
 but stay here is going to start throwing 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:55.300
 how are you 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:58.110
 without fire and explode in exploding two 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:02.950
 times but it explodes once 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:06.390
 then for example we will be one 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:09.730
 an example with this skin that is like a 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:11.350
 black hole and it starts to be a hole here 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:13.480
 on earth 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.040
 this seems to me I do not know to me it seemed very 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.800
 useful to get minerals and all 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.390
 things because to come down like the 16th floor 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.740
 has gone down 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.740
