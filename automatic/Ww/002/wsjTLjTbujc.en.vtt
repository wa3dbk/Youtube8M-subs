under eye area i'm not very happy with

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.910

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
the coverage that it gave me it's like a

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.170 
the coverage that it gave me it's like a
concealer<00:03:28.760> that<00:03:29.620> does<00:03:30.620> not<00:03:31.010> really<00:03:31.459> cover<00:03:31.910> a

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
concealer that does not really cover a

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.229 
concealer that does not really cover a
lot<00:03:32.420> so<00:03:32.840> I<00:03:33.200> mean<00:03:33.769> I<00:03:33.980> guess<00:03:34.370> my<00:03:34.610> blemishes<00:03:34.820> are

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239
