years ago I made my own stir just
temporarily<00:00:38.160> just<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.790> mix<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.660> grout<00:00:40.500> mortar

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
temporarily just a mix of grout mortar

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.369 
temporarily just a mix of grout mortar
and<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.730> worked<00:00:41.879> out<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:42.059> well<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.750> still

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
and it worked out so well and I still

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:43.850 
and it worked out so well and I still
use<00:00:43.410> it

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
use it

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.310 
use it
problem<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.730> it's<00:00:44.910> big<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:45.539> I'm<00:00:46.020> going<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.200> use

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
problem is it's big so I'm going to use

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.660 
problem is it's big so I'm going to use
the<00:00:46.410> same<00:00:46.590> design<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.579> make<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.789> smaller<00:00:48.149> one

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
the same design and make a smaller one

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.250 
the same design and make a smaller one
basically<00:00:50.670> what<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:50.940> do<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.930> just<00:00:51.989> give<00:00:52.170> me<00:00:52.230> a

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
basically what I do is I just give me a

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.630 
basically what I do is I just give me a
straight<00:00:52.469> rod<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.070> just<00:00:53.250> have<00:00:53.340> this<00:00:53.430> laying

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640

little further cut it off it's like I
could<00:01:14.070> see<00:01:14.100> press<00:01:16.670> but<00:01:17.670> what<00:01:17.909> I'm<00:01:18.000> going<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.150> do

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
could see press but what I'm going to do

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:25.120 
could see press but what I'm going to do
is<00:01:19.530> weld<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.280> bottom

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.210 

and<00:01:25.220> this<00:01:25.909> is<00:01:26.119> your<00:01:26.619> grabbers<00:01:27.619> this<00:01:27.799> grabs<00:01:28.070> all

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
and this is your grabbers this grabs all

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.340 
and this is your grabbers this grabs all
the<00:01:28.280> crap<00:01:28.549> off<00:01:28.729> the<00:01:28.850> bottom<00:01:29.119> and<00:01:29.270> it<00:01:29.930> spins<00:01:30.140> in

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
the crap off the bottom and it spins in

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.700 
the crap off the bottom and it spins in
this<00:01:30.470> direction<00:01:31.180> so<00:01:32.180> these<00:01:32.540> are<00:01:32.960> never

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
this direction so these are never

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.230 
this direction so these are never
digging<00:01:34.009> into<00:01:34.280> the<00:01:34.460> side<00:01:34.640> of<00:01:34.670> the<00:01:34.820> can

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
digging into the side of the can

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.310 
digging into the side of the can
they're<00:01:35.630> going<00:01:35.810> away<00:01:35.930> but<00:01:36.680> then<00:01:36.830> you<00:01:36.950> need<00:01:37.100> a

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
they're going away but then you need a

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.170 
they're going away but then you need a
fins<00:01:39.320> then<00:01:40.310> I<00:01:40.369> just<00:01:40.520> have<00:01:40.640> two<00:01:40.820> little<00:01:41.060> pieces

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
fins then I just have two little pieces

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.090 
fins then I just have two little pieces
of<00:01:41.330> flat<00:01:41.540> stock<00:01:43.000> here<00:01:44.000> and<00:01:44.149> here<00:01:44.740> they're<00:01:45.740> one

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
of flat stock here and here they're one

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.149 
of flat stock here and here they're one
piece<00:01:46.810> and<00:01:47.810> I<00:01:48.080> just<00:01:48.289> drilled<00:01:48.560> some<00:01:49.130> holes

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
piece and I just drilled some holes

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.670 
piece and I just drilled some holes
drilled<00:01:50.060> a<00:01:50.119> couple<00:01:50.149> little<00:01:50.420> holes<00:01:50.659> and<00:01:51.020> a<00:01:51.500> big

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
drilled a couple little holes and a big

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.279 
drilled a couple little holes and a big
hole<00:01:51.890> the<00:01:52.670> big<00:01:52.820> hole<00:01:53.030> so<00:01:53.450> it<00:01:53.570> can<00:01:53.720> fit<00:01:54.020> around

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
hole the big hole so it can fit around

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:56.590 
hole the big hole so it can fit around
here<00:01:54.560> one<00:01:55.310> will<00:01:55.460> go<00:01:55.549> one<00:01:55.700> direction<00:01:55.820> the<00:01:56.570> other

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
here one will go one direction the other

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.870 
here one will go one direction the other
go<00:01:57.140> the<00:01:57.259> other<00:01:57.409> direction<00:01:57.610> like<00:01:58.610> a<00:01:58.640> little

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
go the other direction like a little

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.490 
go the other direction like a little
propeller<00:01:59.420> and<00:01:59.750> what<00:01:59.869> that'll<00:02:00.110> do<00:02:00.229> is<00:02:00.259> that'll

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
propeller and what that'll do is that'll

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.950 
propeller and what that'll do is that'll
preen<00:02:00.860> the<00:02:01.460> solids<00:02:01.850> off<00:02:01.970> the<00:02:02.119> bottom<00:02:02.420> and<00:02:02.750> push

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
preen the solids off the bottom and push

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.050 
preen the solids off the bottom and push
them<00:02:03.110> up<00:02:03.229> the<00:02:03.860> little<00:02:04.159> holes<00:02:04.369> in<00:02:04.640> there<00:02:04.819> are
