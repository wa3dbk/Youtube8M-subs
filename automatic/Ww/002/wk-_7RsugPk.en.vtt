00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.990
 ah 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.139
 two 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:21.259
 let's start with the application of 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.590
 our molds in this case we are going to 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:27.020
 use the platinum mold in that and it's 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.779
 currently the mold that has as 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.000
 recommended to be able to work with 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.040
 before the application we paste by 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.460
 below this granny who comes here to 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.219
 center 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.899
 and on the line you open your mold for 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.020
 can adjust it according to the nail 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.660
 natural that you have the molds of ns and 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.180
 they are covered with dancing which is a 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.059
 plastic so we can 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.670
 get very pronounced curves without 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.800
 that the mold is deformed contrary to 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.149
 other brands where we notice 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.860
 that when folding it 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.930
 immediately the form of 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.629
 this mold in this case you can 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.250
 readjust it when you have this same 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.990
 mold you arrange it to the best a nail and 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.090
 later you want to take her another one 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.039
 more girl you can do it with these molds 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.679
 platinum 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:15.660
 ns and was the first to patent a mold 

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:18.660
 for artificial nails this is already done 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.690
 more than 60 years so you can have 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.660
 trust that they have the best technology 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.700
 and in this case, the 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.789
 golden molds because this mold is 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.039
 fit better to any natural nail be 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:34.800
 a very narrow natural nail is a nail 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:38.100
 very wide natural 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:41.220
 or maybe a finger that has too much 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.000
 skin to the sides you can adjust it 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.000
 perfectly 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.869
 the length of this mold is the necessary 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.040
 for the average nails in the salon 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:56.930
 we will make an application where 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:58.640
 let's use an extra long tree but you 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.979
 you will realize that for customers of 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.290
 lounge where an application average 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.659
 it's a number two and a half years 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.330
 you can perfectly be using 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.369
 these molds without problems a number two 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.489
 or two and a half we are talking about a 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.340
 application of a client who 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:19.519
 like medium or short medium nails 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.920
 usually 10 clients long you're going to 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.870
 have that result in 7 clients of what 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.170
 what do you casually request? 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.420
 you are going to check the sides of the 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.480
 mold that will fit next to the 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.489
 Our customer's finger will check in 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.519
 the lateral part that the mold does not remain 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:40.160
 looking up or down and what 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.150
 let's adjust here to the center that does not 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.280
 we are left empty 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.739
 then in that way you will know that you have 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.480
 the correct application many times 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.810
 our clients have their fingers 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:55.280
 tricks not completely straight for it 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:58.819
 you can flip your hand 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.709
 and then check the front view of 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.690
 that way you 'll know if the mold continues 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.600
 correct or if you have to do some 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.310
 fit do not just stay with one 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.069
 seen because it's probably going to 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.260
 present many mistakes or you can do 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.510
 applications that in the end will not look 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.250
 aesthetically correct or that can 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.800
 have problems where they could 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.720
 breaking the nails is one of the reasons 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.880
 why people later do not 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.980
 they want to use the mold nails 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:29.810
 because they have a bad reputation for 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:32.200
 applications where the nail has lower 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.200
 durability
