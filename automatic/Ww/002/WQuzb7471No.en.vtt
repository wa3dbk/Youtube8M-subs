this is a messed up amazing I'm sorry
how<00:00:53.610> do<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.970> pick<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.540> right<00:00:54.660> path

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.300 

embrace<00:01:04.120> the<00:01:04.420> power<00:01:04.660> primate<00:01:05.320> and<00:01:05.560> you'll

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
embrace the power primate and you'll

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.000 
embrace the power primate and you'll
discover<00:01:06.820> the<00:01:06.940> right<00:01:07.270> path<00:01:07.600> is<00:01:07.990> often<00:01:08.650> the<00:01:08.800> one

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
discover the right path is often the one

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:23.410 
discover the right path is often the one
you're<00:01:09.280> already<00:01:09.580> on
