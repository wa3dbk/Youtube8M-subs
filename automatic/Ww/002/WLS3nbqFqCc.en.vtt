00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
villages a lot of planes you know it's

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.610

got a mushroom biome all the way down

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.550 
got a mushroom biome all the way down
there<00:00:20.890> so<00:00:21.070> it<00:00:21.220> does<00:00:21.460> have<00:00:21.490> all<00:00:22.150> I<00:00:22.420> think<00:00:23.200> every

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:26.520 
biome except for the Mountain biome I
mean<00:00:25.660> there<00:00:25.780> may<00:00:25.900> be<00:00:25.930> one<00:00:26.140> here<00:00:26.320> I<00:00:26.350> don't

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:26.530 
mean there may be one here I don't

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.890 
mean there may be one here I don't
remember<00:00:26.619> correctly<00:00:27.190> but<00:00:27.490> the<00:00:27.760> the<00:00:28.539> really

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
interesting thing about this map and the

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:31.620 
interesting thing about this map and the
reason<00:00:30.610> I<00:00:30.670> want<00:00:30.850> to<00:00:30.940> make<00:00:31.029> this<00:00:31.060> video<00:00:31.330> is

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
reason I want to make this video is

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.630 
reason I want to make this video is
right<00:00:32.020> here<00:00:32.349> as<00:00:32.920> you<00:00:33.070> can<00:00:33.160> see<00:00:33.340> I've<00:00:33.430> had<00:00:33.609> a

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
right here as you can see I've had a

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.130 
right here as you can see I've had a
marker<00:00:33.999> here<00:00:34.030> so<00:00:34.329> there's<00:00:34.510> a<00:00:34.569> dungeon<00:00:34.989> you

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
marker here so there's a dungeon you

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.540 
marker here so there's a dungeon you
know<00:00:35.260> right<00:00:35.530> under<00:00:35.739> the<00:00:35.829> village<00:00:36.159> but<00:00:36.370> it's

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
know right under the village but it's

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.930 
know right under the village but it's
not<00:00:36.819> really<00:00:37.059> right<00:00:37.359> under<00:00:37.809> its<00:00:38.530> basically<00:00:39.399> in

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
not really right under its basically in

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.509 
not really right under its basically in
this<00:00:40.420> guy's<00:00:40.809> basement<00:00:41.260> you<00:00:41.710> can<00:00:41.769> see<00:00:42.159> there<00:00:42.370> is

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:42.519 
this guy's basement you can see there is

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:44.520 
this guy's basement you can see there is
only<00:00:43.059> like<00:00:43.269> a<00:00:43.390> four<00:00:43.659> block<00:00:43.809> separation

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
only like a four block separation

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.229 
only like a four block separation
between<00:00:44.679> dungeon<00:00:45.280> cobblestone<00:00:45.850> and<00:00:46.030> house

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
between dungeon cobblestone and house

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.379 
between dungeon cobblestone and house
cobblestone<00:00:46.929> so<00:00:47.920> he's<00:00:48.699> pretty<00:00:48.969> much<00:00:49.179> got<00:00:49.359> a

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:49.389 
cobblestone so he's pretty much got a

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:50.969 
cobblestone so he's pretty much got a
dungeon<00:00:49.839> in<00:00:49.989> his<00:00:50.139> basement<00:00:50.319> and<00:00:50.739> it<00:00:50.829> is<00:00:50.949> a

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:50.979 
dungeon in his basement and it is a

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:52.500 
dungeon in his basement and it is a
surface<00:00:51.309> dungeon<00:00:51.879> to<00:00:51.999> I<00:00:52.059> just<00:00:52.300> kind<00:00:52.449> of

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
surface dungeon to I just kind of

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.419 
surface dungeon to I just kind of
cleared<00:00:52.749> out<00:00:52.839> the<00:00:52.870> sand<00:00:53.260> but<00:00:53.530> it<00:00:54.010> had<00:00:54.219> fallen

00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:54.429 
cleared out the sand but it had fallen

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:56.250 
cleared out the sand but it had fallen
in<00:00:54.760> right<00:00:54.969> here<00:00:55.149> so<00:00:55.329> you<00:00:55.389> could<00:00:55.690> see<00:00:56.049> it<00:00:56.139> from

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
in right here so you could see it from

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.369 
in right here so you could see it from
the<00:00:56.440> surface<00:00:56.949> and<00:00:57.659> you<00:00:58.659> know<00:00:58.780> what<00:00:58.929> I<00:00:59.079> don't

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
the surface and you know what I don't

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:00.899 
the surface and you know what I don't
see<00:00:59.620> this<00:00:59.769> a<00:00:59.799> lot<00:00:59.920> so<00:01:00.280> I<00:01:00.309> really<00:01:00.609> wanted<00:01:00.819> to

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:00.909 
see this a lot so I really wanted to

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:02.219 
see this a lot so I really wanted to
make<00:01:00.999> this<00:01:01.149> video<00:01:01.329> because<00:01:01.539> I<00:01:01.809> think<00:01:01.929> it's

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:02.229 
make this video because I think it's

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:03.719 
make this video because I think it's
pretty<00:01:02.530> funny<00:01:02.679> that<00:01:02.949> he's<00:01:03.159> got<00:01:03.339> this<00:01:03.459> in<00:01:03.609> his

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:03.729 
pretty funny that he's got this in his

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:07.080 
pretty funny that he's got this in his
basement<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:05.110> know<00:01:05.229> I'm<00:01:05.530> not<00:01:05.590> sure<00:01:06.159> all<00:01:06.399> what

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
basement you know I'm not sure all what

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.700 
basement you know I'm not sure all what
they<00:01:07.240> told<00:01:07.689> him<00:01:07.930> when<00:01:08.079> he<00:01:08.200> bought<00:01:08.380> this<00:01:08.530> house

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
they told him when he bought this house

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.440 
they told him when he bought this house
but<00:01:09.009> I<00:01:09.189> don't<00:01:09.369> think<00:01:09.549> anybody<00:01:09.759> told<00:01:10.149> him<00:01:10.360> about

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
but I don't think anybody told him about

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.020 
but I don't think anybody told him about
monsters<00:01:10.990> in<00:01:11.140> the<00:01:11.229> basement<00:01:11.680> so<00:01:11.950> yeah<00:01:12.610> I

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
monsters in the basement so yeah I

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.910 
monsters in the basement so yeah I

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
thought that was pretty funny the

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.230 
thought that was pretty funny the
coordinates<00:01:15.189> are<00:01:15.430> right<00:01:15.490> here<00:01:16.000> for<00:01:16.180> this

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
coordinates are right here for this

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.060 
coordinates are right here for this
village<00:01:16.659> and<00:01:16.899> obviously<00:01:17.710> you're<00:01:17.979> gonna
