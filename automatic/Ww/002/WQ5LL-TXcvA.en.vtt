controlling a computer from a remote

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.269 
controlling a computer from a remote
location<00:00:14.870> so<00:00:15.870> that<00:00:16.020> could<00:00:16.199> be<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.859> another

computer on the network or another

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.260 
computer on the network or another
computer<00:00:19.890> somewhere<00:00:20.250> else<00:00:20.400> in<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.820> world<00:00:21.000> as

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
computer somewhere else in the world as

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.570 
computer somewhere else in the world as
long<00:00:21.689> as<00:00:21.810> you've<00:00:21.930> got<00:00:22.310> everything<00:00:23.310> configured

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
long as you've got everything configured

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.630 
long as you've got everything configured
correctly<00:00:24.529> so<00:00:25.529> essentially<00:00:26.160> they<00:00:26.279> do<00:00:26.460> the

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
correctly so essentially they do the

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
correctly so essentially they do the
same<00:00:26.789> thing<00:00:27.199> VNC<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.529> RDP<00:00:29.359> but<00:00:30.359> there<00:00:30.539> are

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
same thing VNC and RDP but there are

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.450 
same thing VNC and RDP but there are
slight<00:00:30.929> differences<00:00:31.170> between<00:00:31.560> them<00:00:31.920> so<00:00:32.399> I'm

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
slight differences between them so I'm

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.590 
slight differences between them so I'm
going<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.700> try<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:32.910> explain<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.420> main

going to try to explain the main

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.479 
going to try to explain the main
differences<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.350> help<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.890> decide<00:00:35.190> which

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
differences and help you decide which

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.150 
differences and help you decide which
one<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.760> best<00:00:35.880> for<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.809> for<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.710> for

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
from their website it works just as well

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.910 
from their website it works just as well
as<00:01:21.750> they<00:01:22.320> were<00:01:22.680> not<00:01:22.710> built<00:01:23.130> into<00:01:23.310> Windows<00:01:24.920> so

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
as they were not built into Windows so

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.929 
as they were not built into Windows so
that's<00:01:26.759> kind<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:28.560> convenience<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.579> remote

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
that's kind of the convenience of remote

that's kind of the convenience of remote
desktop<00:01:30.420> connection<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:31.110> built<00:01:31.619> into<00:01:32.070> Windows

desktop connection to built into Windows

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.490 
desktop connection to built into Windows
if<00:01:32.579> you're<00:01:32.729> using<00:01:32.970> Windows<00:01:33.479> it's<00:01:34.049> really

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
if you're using Windows it's really

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.050 
if you're using Windows it's really
really<00:01:34.770> easy<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:35.340> connect<00:01:37.220> the<00:01:38.220> disadvantage

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
really easy to connect the disadvantage

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.749 
really easy to connect the disadvantage
of<00:01:39.270> RDP<00:01:39.990> is<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.909> treats<00:01:41.909> each<00:01:43.759> connection

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
of RDP is that it treats each connection

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.560 
of RDP is that it treats each connection
I<00:01:44.880> suppose<00:01:45.240> as<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.659> new<00:01:46.170> session<00:01:47.420> what<00:01:48.420> that

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
I suppose as a new session what that

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.840 
I suppose as a new session what that
means<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:49.820> you<00:01:50.820> if<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:52.070> have<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.100> user<00:01:53.460> logged

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
means is you if you have a user logged

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.880 
means is you if you have a user logged
on<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.299> machine<00:01:54.659> then<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.380> go<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.649> try

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
on to the machine then you go and try

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.260 
on to the machine then you go and try
and<00:01:56.009> connect<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.820> from<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.420> remote<00:01:57.990> location

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
and connect to it from a remote location

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.940 
and connect to it from a remote location
you'll<00:02:00.270> not<00:02:00.509> see<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:01.079> current<00:02:01.560> session

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
you'll not see that current session

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.980 
you'll not see that current session
that's<00:02:02.100> logged<00:02:02.460> onto<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:02.969> computer<00:02:03.180> you

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
that's logged onto that computer you

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.440 
that's logged onto that computer you
you'll<00:02:04.380> be<00:02:04.649> logged<00:02:04.890> on<00:02:05.130> again<00:02:05.759> as<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.090> new

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
you'll be logged on again as a new

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.339 
you'll be logged on again as a new
person<00:02:07.250> so<00:02:08.250> if<00:02:08.819> you're<00:02:09.539> trying<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.840> check<00:02:10.110> on

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
person so if you're trying to check on

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.920 
person so if you're trying to check on
something<00:02:10.830> that<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.129> computers<00:02:11.640> doing<00:02:11.930> RDP

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
something that the computers doing RDP

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.930 
something that the computers doing RDP
is<00:02:12.989> not<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.349> thing<00:02:13.530> for<00:02:13.739> you

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
is not the thing for you

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.320 
is not the thing for you
because<00:02:14.210> you'll<00:02:14.390> not<00:02:14.570> be<00:02:14.720> able<00:02:14.750> to<00:02:15.970> easily<00:02:16.970> and

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
because you'll not be able to easily and

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.920 
because you'll not be able to easily and
I'm<00:02:18.490> aware<00:02:19.490> of<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:19.790> fact<00:02:20.030> that<00:02:20.180> it's<00:02:20.420> possible

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
I'm aware of the fact that it's possible

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.520 
I'm aware of the fact that it's possible
but<00:02:21.790> using<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:23.030> default<00:02:23.750> client<00:02:24.350> and

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
but using the default client and

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.190 
but using the default client and
settings<00:02:25.010> it<00:02:25.520> doesn't<00:02:26.420> work<00:02:26.540> that<00:02:26.570> way

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
settings it doesn't work that way

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.450 
settings it doesn't work that way
and<00:02:28.100> VNC<00:02:28.430> does<00:02:29.420> however<00:02:29.720> VNC<00:02:30.710> will<00:02:31.100> to<00:02:31.220> show

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
and VNC does however VNC will to show

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.850 
and VNC does however VNC will to show
you<00:02:31.520> what<00:02:31.850> is<00:02:32.120> currently<00:02:32.660> being<00:02:32.750> shown<00:02:32.990> on<00:02:33.350> the

you what is currently being shown on the

check up on a backup a virus scan a file
download<00:02:42.430> VNC<00:02:43.430> will<00:02:43.820> show<00:02:44.120> you<00:02:44.180> exactly<00:02:44.840> what

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
download VNC will show you exactly what

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.810 
download VNC will show you exactly what
you<00:02:45.320> would<00:02:45.440> see<00:02:45.680> if<00:02:45.890> you<00:02:46.340> went<00:02:46.580> to<00:02:46.670> the

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
you would see if you went to the

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.310 
you would see if you went to the
physical<00:02:47.000> computer<00:02:47.720> and<00:02:47.840> turn<00:02:47.960> the<00:02:48.110> monitor

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
physical computer and turn the monitor

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.380 
physical computer and turn the monitor
on<00:02:49.060> so<00:02:50.060> that's<00:02:50.270> the<00:02:50.450> main<00:02:50.660> difference<00:02:51.190> I<00:02:52.390> find

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
on so that's the main difference I find

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.800 
on so that's the main difference I find
between<00:02:53.570> remote<00:02:54.290> desktop<00:02:54.800> connection<00:02:55.190> and

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
between remote desktop connection and

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.870 
between remote desktop connection and
VNC<00:02:57.670> VNC<00:02:59.590> isn't<00:03:00.590> built<00:03:00.950> into<00:03:01.280> Windows<00:03:01.640> which

VNC VNC isn't built into Windows which

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.660 
VNC VNC isn't built into Windows which
usually<00:03:02.330> requires<00:03:02.900> third<00:03:03.260> party<00:03:03.680> software<00:03:03.890> it

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
usually requires third party software it

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.360 
usually requires third party software it
is<00:03:05.210> however<00:03:07.420> built<00:03:08.420> into<00:03:08.840> like<00:03:08.990> the<00:03:09.710> server

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
connect using our DP at once so it does

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.370 
have limitations in that form VNC it
will<00:04:00.440> less<00:04:00.730> lots<00:04:01.730> of<00:04:01.880> people<00:04:02.269> connect<00:04:02.690> all<00:04:03.050> at

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
with VNC did also say the same thing if

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.620 
with VNC did also say the same thing if

five people managed to connect to a
computer<00:04:15.290> using<00:04:16.160> RDP<00:04:16.870> they'd<00:04:17.870> all<00:04:18.080> have<00:04:18.350> their

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
computer using RDP they'd all have their

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.880 
computer using RDP they'd all have their
own<00:04:18.620> session<00:04:19.220> that<00:04:19.700> they'll<00:04:20.120> see<00:04:20.570> a<00:04:20.890> different

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
own session that they'll see a different

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:23.860 
own session that they'll see a different
thing<00:04:22.220> as<00:04:22.400> though<00:04:22.610> they<00:04:23.060> were<00:04:23.150> using<00:04:23.630> five

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
thing as though they were using five

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.090 
thing as though they were using five
separate<00:04:24.320> computers

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
separate computers

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.990 
separate computers
um<00:04:27.350> so<00:04:28.350> you<00:04:28.410> just<00:04:28.680> need<00:04:28.830> to<00:04:28.980> decide<00:04:29.130> which<00:04:29.760> one

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
um so you just need to decide which one

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.760 
um so you just need to decide which one
you<00:04:30.030> want<00:04:30.210> which<00:04:30.720> one<00:04:30.960> will<00:04:31.140> work<00:04:31.320> best<00:04:31.380> for

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
you want which one will work best for

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.070 
you want which one will work best for
what<00:04:32.040> you're<00:04:32.250> trying<00:04:32.310> to<00:04:32.520> do<00:04:32.700> our<00:04:33.150> DP<00:04:33.810> is

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
what you're trying to do our DP is

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.440 
what you're trying to do our DP is
faster<00:04:34.770> than<00:04:35.070> VNC<00:04:35.490> because<00:04:36.030> of<00:04:36.150> the<00:04:36.240> way<00:04:36.360> it

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
faster than VNC because of the way it

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.400 
faster than VNC because of the way it
works<00:04:36.660> our<00:04:37.170> DP<00:04:37.740> a<00:04:37.770> kind<00:04:38.070> of<00:04:38.190> sends<00:04:39.410> everything

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
works our DP a kind of sends everything

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.340 
works our DP a kind of sends everything
you<00:04:40.650> see<00:04:40.830> as<00:04:40.950> information<00:04:41.760> so<00:04:42.090> it<00:04:42.150> sends<00:04:42.510> the

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
you see as information so it sends the

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.530 
you see as information so it sends the
color<00:04:43.680> of<00:04:43.920> things<00:04:44.190> that<00:04:44.430> sends<00:04:44.820> the

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
color of things that sends the

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.870 
color of things that sends the
coordinates<00:04:46.140> of<00:04:46.350> where<00:04:46.560> things<00:04:47.220> are<00:04:47.610> on<00:04:47.850> the

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
coordinates of where things are on the

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:54.950 
coordinates of where things are on the
screen<00:04:48.320> VNC<00:04:49.460> is<00:04:50.460> kind<00:04:50.730> of<00:04:53.150> it<00:04:54.150> doesn't<00:04:54.630> a

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
screen VNC is kind of it doesn't a

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.320 
screen VNC is kind of it doesn't a
different<00:04:55.350> way<00:04:55.560> it<00:04:55.890> just<00:04:56.310> basically<00:04:56.610> sends

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
different way it just basically sends

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.170 
different way it just basically sends
images<00:04:58.220> what's<00:04:59.220> probably<00:04:59.550> the<00:04:59.640> simplest<00:04:59.970> way

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
images what's probably the simplest way

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.690 
images what's probably the simplest way
I<00:05:00.270> can<00:05:00.570> explain<00:05:01.110> that<00:05:01.350> so<00:05:02.160> that's<00:05:02.520> the

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
I can explain that so that's the

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.070 
I can explain that so that's the
difference<00:05:03.030> between<00:05:03.210> how<00:05:03.630> they<00:05:03.870> actually

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
difference between how they actually

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.160 
difference between how they actually
work<00:05:04.770> so<00:05:04.800> that<00:05:05.100> means<00:05:05.310> remote<00:05:06.150> desktop<00:05:06.750> it's

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.170 
work so that means remote desktop it's

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.360 
work so that means remote desktop it's
faster<00:05:08.390> there's<00:05:09.390> as<00:05:10.320> far<00:05:10.380> as<00:05:10.740> I'm<00:05:10.860> aware<00:05:11.010> this

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
faster there's as far as I'm aware this

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.030 
faster there's as far as I'm aware this
there's<00:05:11.820> no<00:05:11.940> argument<00:05:12.720> there<00:05:12.780> remote<00:05:13.500> desktop

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
there's no argument there remote desktop

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.910 
there's no argument there remote desktop
is<00:05:14.190> it's<00:05:15.090> always<00:05:15.210> being<00:05:15.990> faster<00:05:16.500> for<00:05:16.620> me<00:05:16.770> you

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 
is it's always being faster for me you

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.850 
is it's always being faster for me you
can<00:05:17.070> kind<00:05:17.310> of<00:05:17.900> use<00:05:18.900> it<00:05:19.140> as<00:05:19.170> though<00:05:19.620> you're

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
can kind of use it as though you're

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.620 
can kind of use it as though you're
physically<00:05:20.340> sitting<00:05:20.640> at<00:05:20.910> the<00:05:21.090> computer

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
physically sitting at the computer

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.720 
physically sitting at the computer
especially<00:05:22.080> if<00:05:22.500> you're<00:05:22.650> on<00:05:22.740> the<00:05:22.860> same<00:05:23.040> network

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:23.730 
especially if you're on the same network

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.170 
especially if you're on the same network
you<00:05:24.000> usually<00:05:24.960> have<00:05:25.200> no<00:05:25.560> issues<00:05:25.890> with<00:05:26.100> lag<00:05:26.940> and

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
you usually have no issues with lag and

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.860 
you usually have no issues with lag and
things<00:05:27.840> like<00:05:28.020> that<00:05:28.430> and<00:05:29.430> so<00:05:29.640> they're<00:05:30.600> the<00:05:30.750> main

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
things like that and so they're the main

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.140 
things like that and so they're the main
differences<00:05:31.500> between<00:05:31.560> the<00:05:31.950> two<00:05:32.070> protocols

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
differences between the two protocols

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.620 
differences between the two protocols
neither<00:05:33.600> are<00:05:33.720> 100%<00:05:34.290> secure<00:05:34.980> so<00:05:35.420> if<00:05:36.420> you're

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
neither are 100% secure so if you're

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.590 
neither are 100% secure so if you're
trying<00:05:36.900> to<00:05:36.960> get<00:05:37.170> the<00:05:37.350> the<00:05:37.530> one<00:05:37.680> that<00:05:38.090> has<00:05:39.090> is

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
trying to get the the one that has is

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.710 
trying to get the the one that has is
the<00:05:39.900> most<00:05:40.110> secure<00:05:41.120> there's<00:05:42.120> probably<00:05:42.480> better

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
the most secure there's probably better

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.280 
the most secure there's probably better
solutions<00:05:43.940> if<00:05:44.940> I<00:05:45.390> was<00:05:45.510> going<00:05:45.690> to<00:05:45.750> choose<00:05:46.020> want

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
solutions if I was going to choose want

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.260 
solutions if I was going to choose want
to<00:05:46.410> be<00:05:46.560> more<00:05:46.740> secure<00:05:47.100> I'd<00:05:47.220> say<00:05:47.430> remote<00:05:47.730> desktop

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
to be more secure I'd say remote desktop

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.690 
to be more secure I'd say remote desktop
because<00:05:48.420> VNC<00:05:49.070> connects<00:05:50.070> to<00:05:50.250> the<00:05:50.370> current

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:50.700 
because VNC connects to the current

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.460 
because VNC connects to the current
session<00:05:50.910> so<00:05:51.660> that<00:05:51.720> means<00:05:51.990> if<00:05:52.140> you're<00:05:52.260> logged

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470
