00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
Garnett's and pretty much every category

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.270 
Garnett's and pretty much every category
these<00:00:37.590> two<00:00:37.829> groupies<00:00:38.730> are<00:00:39.090> based<00:00:39.629> off<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:40.110> the

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
these two groupies are based off of the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.510 
these two groupies are based off of the
silver<00:00:41.280> garnet<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:42.530> the<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.980> other<00:00:44.219> tool

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
silver garnet so the the other tool

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.430 
silver garnet so the the other tool
rubies<00:00:45.510> are<00:00:47.239> movie<00:00:48.239> versions<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.050> silver

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
rubies are movie versions of the silver

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.340 
rubies are movie versions of the silver
garnet<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.460> that's<00:00:51.059> why<00:00:51.270> they<00:00:51.570> probably<00:00:51.870> came

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
garnet so that's why they probably came

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.270 
garnet so that's why they probably came
and<00:00:52.649> compared<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.660> unexplained<00:00:55.129> but<00:00:56.129> it

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
and compared to the unexplained but it

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.459 
and compared to the unexplained but it
next<00:00:56.850> I'll<00:00:56.940> have<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.210> give<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.989> second<00:00:58.320> best

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
next I'll have to give the second best

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.319 
next I'll have to give the second best
to<00:00:58.829> the<00:01:00.980> all-time<00:01:01.980> scoring<00:01:02.340> one<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.879> just<00:01:03.120> a

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
to the all-time scoring one is just a

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.570 
to the all-time scoring one is just a
better<00:01:03.600> score<00:01:04.100> can<00:01:05.100> rebound<00:01:05.750> just<00:01:06.750> about<00:01:07.049> as

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
better score can rebound just about as

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.920 
better score can rebound just about as
good<00:01:08.580> as<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.350> glass<00:01:10.350> cleaner<00:01:10.710> one<00:01:11.659> except<00:01:12.659> for

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
good as the glass cleaner one except for

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.140 
good as the glass cleaner one except for
offensive<00:01:13.439> rebounding<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.490> think<00:01:14.820> that's<00:01:15.000> just

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
offensive rebounding I think that's just

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.980 
offensive rebounding I think that's just
about<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.600> only<00:01:16.700> main<00:01:17.700> difference<00:01:18.210> yet<00:01:18.630> and

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
about the only main difference yet and

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.710 
about the only main difference yet and
he's<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.380> much<00:01:19.650> better<00:01:19.680> post<00:01:20.280> player<00:01:20.610> than<00:01:21.600> the

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
he's a much better post player than the

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.870 
he's a much better post player than the
glass<00:01:21.960> cleaner<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.710> then<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.549> next<00:01:23.670> would

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
glass cleaner and then the next would

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.429 
glass cleaner and then the next would
have<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.119> be<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.299> glass<00:01:24.509> cleaner<00:01:24.840> he's<00:01:25.229> like

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
have to be the glass cleaner he's like

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.720 
have to be the glass cleaner he's like

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
a slightly better or offensive than the

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.930 
a slightly better or offensive than the
silver<00:01:31.030> player<00:01:31.560> but<00:01:32.700> definitely<00:01:33.700> want<00:01:33.880> to
