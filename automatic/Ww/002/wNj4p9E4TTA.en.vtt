look<00:00:13.049> for<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.559> Allspark<00:00:14.129> because<00:00:14.850> our

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
look for the Allspark because our

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.970 
look for the Allspark because our
computers<00:00:15.480> know<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.900> journal<00:00:16.230> location<00:00:16.770> it
