it<00:00:25.199> looks<00:00:25.380> beautiful<00:00:25.619> without<00:00:26.099> any<00:00:26.460> cover<00:00:26.609> at

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
it looks beautiful without any cover at

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.089 
it looks beautiful without any cover at
all<00:00:26.880> but<00:00:27.180> I'm<00:00:27.359> going<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.570> put<00:00:28.019> this<00:00:28.590> one<00:00:28.800> on<00:00:28.949> it

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
all but I'm going to put this one on it

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.669 
all but I'm going to put this one on it
also<00:00:30.000> when<00:00:30.390> I<00:00:30.420> used<00:00:30.810> Aaron's<00:00:31.289> printing

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
also when I used Aaron's printing

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.000 
also when I used Aaron's printing
instructions<00:00:32.719> they<00:00:33.719> didn't<00:00:33.960> cut<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.590> paper

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
instructions they didn't cut the paper

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.760 
instructions they didn't cut the paper
for<00:00:35.340> me<00:00:35.460> afterwards<00:00:35.969> so<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.899> left<00:00:37.079> this<00:00:37.500> white

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
for me afterwards so it left this white

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.799 
for me afterwards so it left this white
edge<00:00:38.040> around<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.670> but<00:00:39.030> I'm<00:00:39.300> actually<00:00:39.450> going<00:00:39.750> to

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
edge around it but I'm actually going to

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.750 
edge around it but I'm actually going to
leave<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.140> on<00:00:40.230> because<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.890> helps<00:00:41.219> with<00:00:41.430> the

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
leave it on because it helps with the

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.660 
leave it on because it helps with the
way<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:42.840> put<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.110> dust<00:00:43.320> jackets<00:00:43.620> off<00:00:43.770> so

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
way that I put the dust jackets off so

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.400 
way that I put the dust jackets off so
first<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.149> all<00:00:46.940> start<00:00:47.940> with<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.989> book<00:00:49.200> in<00:00:49.320> the

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
first of all start with the book in the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.170 
first of all start with the book in the
center<00:00:50.329> you<00:00:51.329> get<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.510> good<00:00:51.690> idea<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:53.750> where<00:00:54.750> to

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
center you get a good idea of where to

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:04.700 
center you get a good idea of where to
fold<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.390> on<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.960> top<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.500> bottom

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.160 

I'm<00:01:05.159> going<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.400> use<00:01:05.580> unlike<00:01:06.540> Aaron<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.020> don't

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
I'm going to use unlike Aaron I don't

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.410 
I'm going to use unlike Aaron I don't
have<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.320> really<00:01:07.500> fancy<00:01:07.710> tool<00:01:08.150> so<00:01:09.150> I'm<00:01:09.240> just

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
have a really fancy tool so I'm just

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.780 
have a really fancy tool so I'm just
using<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.750> letter<00:01:09.900> opener<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:11.070> score<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.640> the

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
using a letter opener to score it the

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.149 
using a letter opener to score it the
way<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:12.060> she<00:01:12.210> did

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.720 

so<00:01:18.820> then<00:01:18.969> I'm<00:01:19.090> going<00:01:19.119> to<00:01:19.329> just<00:01:19.869> make<00:01:20.020> sure

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:20.730 
so then I'm going to just make sure

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.010 
so then I'm going to just make sure
so<00:01:21.730> in<00:01:21.880> the<00:01:21.970> book<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:23.890> lined<00:01:24.190> up<00:01:24.340> on<00:01:24.520> the<00:01:24.610> bottom

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
so in the book is lined up on the bottom

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.620 
so in the book is lined up on the bottom
that<00:01:26.020> there's<00:01:26.230> some<00:01:26.410> room<00:01:26.590> at<00:01:26.710> the<00:01:26.800> top<00:01:27.630> and

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
that there's some room at the top and

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.820 
that there's some room at the top and
then<00:01:28.720> I'm<00:01:28.810> actually<00:01:28.960> just<00:01:29.200> gonna<00:01:29.410> fold<00:01:29.620> it<00:01:29.800> a

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
then I'm actually just gonna fold it a

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.300 
then I'm actually just gonna fold it a
little<00:01:30.100> bit<00:01:31.410> so<00:01:32.410> that<00:01:32.440> I<00:01:32.620> can<00:01:32.800> see<00:01:33.010> where<00:01:33.190> it's

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
little bit so that I can see where it's

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.030 
little bit so that I can see where it's
gonna<00:01:33.460> start<00:01:34.650> coming<00:01:35.650> over<00:01:35.830> on<00:01:35.920> the<00:01:35.950> other

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
gonna start coming over on the other

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.240 
gonna start coming over on the other
side<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.950> then<00:01:39.040> I'm<00:01:39.100> gonna<00:01:39.280> use<00:01:39.520> my<00:01:39.880> ruler<00:01:40.240> to

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
side and then I'm gonna use my ruler to

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.220 
side and then I'm gonna use my ruler to
score<00:01:42.250> across<00:01:42.610> and<00:01:43.180> I'm<00:01:43.690> gonna<00:01:43.840> make<00:01:44.020> sure<00:01:44.200> I

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.230 
score across and I'm gonna make sure I

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.270 
score across and I'm gonna make sure I
don't<00:01:44.380> score<00:01:45.390> right<00:01:46.390> where<00:01:46.690> the<00:01:46.840> fold<00:01:47.050> is

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
don't score right where the fold is

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.350 
don't score right where the fold is
because<00:01:48.280> I<00:01:48.400> want<00:01:48.610> to<00:01:48.670> have<00:01:48.820> a<00:01:48.850> little<00:01:49.180> more

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
because I want to have a little more

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.010 
because I want to have a little more
space<00:01:49.990> on<00:01:50.320> top<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:52.030> the<00:01:52.150> book<00:01:52.300> isn't<00:01:52.630> held<00:01:52.810> to

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
space on top so the book isn't held to

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:00.800 
space on top so the book isn't held to
type<00:01:53.260> by<00:01:53.470> the<00:01:53.560> jacket

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.649 

you

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
you

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.959 
you
so<00:02:03.350> if<00:02:03.619> you<00:02:03.740> have<00:02:03.890> the<00:02:04.310> top<00:02:04.520> and<00:02:04.549> the<00:02:04.820> bottom

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:04.969 
so if you have the top and the bottom

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:08.109 
so if you have the top and the bottom
folded<00:02:05.539> you<00:02:06.409> should<00:02:06.590> be<00:02:06.710> able<00:02:06.799> to<00:02:06.969> put<00:02:07.969> the

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
folded you should be able to put the

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:15.100 
folded you should be able to put the
book<00:02:08.330> on<00:02:08.739> and<00:02:10.030> have<00:02:11.030> it<00:02:11.209> pretty<00:02:11.630> much<00:02:11.780> fit<00:02:14.110> just

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
book on and have it pretty much fit just

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.800 
book on and have it pretty much fit just
enough<00:02:15.440> room<00:02:15.680> to<00:02:15.709> cover<00:02:15.980> it<00:02:16.160> with<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.370> book

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
enough room to cover it with the book

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.509 
enough room to cover it with the book
then<00:02:17.810> I'm<00:02:17.989> going<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:18.200> pretty<00:02:18.800> much<00:02:18.890> do<00:02:19.130> exactly

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
then I'm going to pretty much do exactly

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:28.449 
then I'm going to pretty much do exactly
what<00:02:19.670> Aaron<00:02:20.000> did<00:02:20.500> to<00:02:21.500> find<00:02:21.709> the<00:02:21.920> center<00:02:27.459> I'm

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
what Aaron did to find the center I'm

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:29.680 
what Aaron did to find the center I'm
going<00:02:28.640> to<00:02:28.700> crease<00:02:28.910> it<00:02:29.090> a<00:02:29.180> little<00:02:29.330> bit<00:02:29.510> just

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
going to crease it a little bit just

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:38.559 
going to crease it a little bit just
like<00:02:29.810> she<00:02:29.959> did<00:02:36.160> and<00:02:37.160> then<00:02:37.970> for<00:02:38.180> my<00:02:38.299> version

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
like she did and then for my version

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.839 
like she did and then for my version
since<00:02:39.560> you<00:02:39.739> have<00:02:40.569> the<00:02:41.569> little<00:02:41.720> fold<00:02:42.049> over<00:02:42.849> you

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 
since you have the little fold over you

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:54.720 
since you have the little fold over you
can<00:02:44.000> actually<00:02:44.920> fit<00:02:45.920> it<00:02:46.040> right<00:02:46.489> to<00:02:46.700> your<00:02:46.790> book

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.510 

and<00:02:55.730> then<00:02:56.180> all<00:02:56.360> you<00:02:56.450> have<00:02:56.540> to<00:02:56.630> do<00:02:56.750> is<00:02:57.400> do<00:02:58.400> the

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
and then all you have to do is do the

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:05.990 
and then all you have to do is do the
same<00:02:58.700> thing<00:02:58.910> on<00:02:59.000> the<00:02:59.060> other<00:02:59.090> side

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.200 

that<00:03:07.000> way<00:03:07.150> you<00:03:07.210> have<00:03:07.360> your<00:03:07.930> book<00:03:08.590> cover<00:03:09.210> held

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.210 
that way you have your book cover held

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.020 
that way you have your book cover held
on<00:03:10.360> really<00:03:10.720> tight<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:12.010> it<00:03:12.280> won't<00:03:12.430> slip<00:03:12.790> or

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
on really tight and it won't slip or

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.720 
on really tight and it won't slip or
slide<00:03:13.150> around<00:03:13.660> if<00:03:14.260> it's<00:03:14.620> in<00:03:14.770> your<00:03:14.950> bag<00:03:15.160> or

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
slide around if it's in your bag or

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.550 
slide around if it's in your bag or
while<00:03:16.420> you're<00:03:16.570> holding<00:03:16.780> and<00:03:17.080> reading<00:03:17.440> it

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
while you're holding and reading it

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.190 
while you're holding and reading it
which<00:03:18.460> is<00:03:18.610> always<00:03:18.790> my<00:03:18.910> least<00:03:19.210> taper<00:03:19.510> part<00:03:19.810> of<00:03:20.050> a

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
which is always my least taper part of a

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.500 
which is always my least taper part of a
dust<00:03:20.410> jacket<00:03:20.470> is<00:03:20.920> when<00:03:21.160> it<00:03:21.280> just<00:03:21.490> falls<00:03:22.300> off

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
dust jacket is when it just falls off

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.230 
dust jacket is when it just falls off
and<00:03:22.780> gets<00:03:22.900> flimsy<00:03:23.380> and<00:03:23.650> bends<00:03:24.490> and<00:03:24.910> stuff<00:03:25.120> like

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.240 
and gets flimsy and bends and stuff like

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.910 
and gets flimsy and bends and stuff like
that<00:03:25.420> this<00:03:25.630> actually<00:03:26.050> fits<00:03:26.260> more<00:03:26.500> like<00:03:26.560> the

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
that this actually fits more like the

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.440 
that this actually fits more like the
plastic<00:03:27.340> covers<00:03:27.610> that<00:03:27.820> they<00:03:27.910> have<00:03:28.090> at<00:03:28.360> the

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
plastic covers that they have at the

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.290 
plastic covers that they have at the
library<00:03:28.680> which<00:03:29.680> I<00:03:29.800> love<00:03:29.980> so<00:03:30.790> anyway<00:03:31.180> that's

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
library which I love so anyway that's

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.210 
library which I love so anyway that's
just<00:03:31.420> an<00:03:31.660> alternative<00:03:32.140> way<00:03:32.590> to<00:03:32.650> put<00:03:32.860> these<00:03:33.010> on

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
just an alternative way to put these on

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.430 
just an alternative way to put these on
