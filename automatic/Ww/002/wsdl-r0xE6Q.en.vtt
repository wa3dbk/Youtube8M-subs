00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.870
 both this is the third video made in a row 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.380
 So not that yearly every month is always the same 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:14.639
 For the first time, there is a topic I would like to do as a mobile video like Romy is 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.289
 always quite tough because not completely saved me 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.789
 and yes but go ahead I've got a video this review 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.769
 born as alderman Simitis 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:28.669
 and the Canarian drama the question where I bought them 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:30.529
 I'm sorry it's a unique piece 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.720
 I made this necklace myself 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.210
 is so from Munich trailer pulls resulted rose to meter finish I have 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.010
 Bought 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.010
 and then I made the chain myself, as it were 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.880
 the oldest tram-keeper is turned on and yes 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.360
 you can buy old tinker Zugerland 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.630
 Naturally 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.950
 and she but that you have with Haiti a whole box from there I have 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.950
 even as trailer and without trailer and stars 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.649
 and in the new idea and 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.500
 No in Calbe 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.330
 I think a lot of that will be in the end 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.200
 This can be there and I have more it has been a lot of detail work 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.320
 for example, to get these cribs that way 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.320
 as rosy as could have been and the eyes of the isotope Coco Schumann 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.960
 and sure 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.800
 Maybe there should and cash 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.850
 maybe he likes it so much, put it in context 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.180
 take up 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.860
 because it still happens very much the followers 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.620
 and 4 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.460
 Dennis Mielke meanwhile won the swimming courses DAX and Dr 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.689
 Mara tinkers I do not want that you because it's the Basques 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.050
 all bands belong 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.290
 for the Space Shuttle of Days makes such a long break 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.290
 maybe it's enough if you won last 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.460
 but it comes with Felix by third brother's silence and Ralph Lewin year 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.020
 meet and sat here blowing 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.800
 Matter surface but still the defensive artist earning power 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.630
 Well meal he got me no hustle and bustle have 5 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.740
 and war 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.990
 That's what he looks like 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.040
 her doctor costs 16 euros 35 a weaker so around 70 euros per 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.590
 year 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.819
 it is off for some parts though 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.819
 28 fans content 

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:25.389
 many other people also asked because we test days again such a gaudy 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:26.159
 to have 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:27.559
 and 

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:31.269
 I assume that I actually only ever buy pallets pretty crisp 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:31.989
 are 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.069
 and then of course the question can also be clear I always carry goals 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:37.439
 browns 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:39.889
 is because the palette is also something for me 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:42.599
 I would say yes 6 3 occurred 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.099
 These drive these and these 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:46.339
 the shooting time 

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:49.909
 are pretty vip-room France not poisoned market only the three girls 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:56.389
 Gold and browns they are and like almost all kids are or satined each one 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:59.389
 says Höpken 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:02.760
 Trapani from the top 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.760
 Ballen's coach is looking for Prause 

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:10.619
 then different and beautiful culture 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.699
 I think they are all very beautiful and 

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:18.339
 all pretty brave so i do not find them raining very often 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:23.340
 and 7 of Annika Kiehn I for even if only in emergencies has on the 

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:24.139
 Hood 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:26.279
 Finzi very nice 

00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:29.609
 put on pressure 9000 of all the slightly darker shade 

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:32.619
 and 16 applied 

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:34.819
 the ghetto Madoff means Ronny Schmidt 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.670
 mam he goes in the gold says oil traces of there is trouble 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.530
 very little color are visible it burned and of course very strong - 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.849
 and since then 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:48.180
 did not bring much 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.180
 she breaks opec member like from 1 Fri though 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.279
 and to make my life on the spot I have enforced their food 

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:59.809
 to present the action with and 

00:03:59.809 --> 00:04:02.809
 Here are the front hang and that there 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:06.239
 on the movable lid 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.059
 it was something i said the colors would be customers 

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:11.769
 I did not realize that now 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.629
 Although you did not find Damiani Krunic, maybe I have special ones 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:17.609
 Geese technique or something like that 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.139
 but I think down here only works 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:21.269
 against the dust 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.270
 and today so warned experiment made and have no eye shadow 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.560
 Base I've just happily got the numbers home 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.020
 improved users can be at 1 and that should just seriously 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.640
 a loophole that does not happen again 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.680
 but there is nothing in the qualification KUG 9 yet 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.550
 therefore have 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.580
 No, maybe there would be something Wildeck 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.059
 and have 

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:45.189
 I really like Palette for the circle 

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:49.409
 finally I have not tried the colors to apply 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:53.439
 but dry of ten she's really super call pigmented is a big one 

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:55.460
 Color spectrum thus with many brown tones 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.360
 then, for any case, whoever does not make it so happy holds 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.280
 and then there are still land heir gold shades showpiece Höhne shades of brown 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.090
 Pielhau high 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.070
 This is also about achieving this goal 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.210
 because Denmark joking about smoking 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.819
 all are doing pretty fawning hands and 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:12.830
 around 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.910
 yes sparkling shimmering that's definitely 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.800
 it is open as Calixto 1 and with Ericsson also firmly translated 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.409
 metallic Steiner and 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:26.259
 if you threaten the stones, Kids and Funky will look into them too 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:29.339
 Directions and that's supposed to reflect the palette and that's what makes it absolute 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.839
 in series often 

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:36.900
 I have often swings in the last video slots with politics and 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.949
 On my blog has already participated in the products of the very subtle bass n 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:44.860
 my first with Jacksons on monday not mentioned and 4 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.860
 swissinfo which linked me the article exactly 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:50.909
 and 

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:54.889
 as 50 yards away parried I manage to speak and I want to help and 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:58.409
 Century are always questions 

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:00.729
 service
