00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.690
 I do not think he deserved to score a goal 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.400
 I do not think many teams have half 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.390
 of him molinÃ³n already plugged to the stick 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.130
 in the first part 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.490
 I think that as you say the first 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.560
 part should have scored a goal not 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.340
 I know if it would come to us to draw or to 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.470
 another thing 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.690
 but if as well as the second part 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.520
 and we were comfortable 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.310
 we were able to steal the ball from 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.230
 sporting are the ones planned then almost 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.340
 they always came to us near the 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.410
 area 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.210
 already forces us to bank clear and not 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.150
 we have been watching 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:46.150
 we lacked a tad to rate 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.430
 a tad but we can not be before a 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.670
 great team that has lost a match in 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.769
 this league is not against betis 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.440
 and I think it deserves undeservedly against 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:57.840
 the betis 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.170
 mister we say now let's 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.370
 Albacete happy and that people think 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.759
 that we have lost may think that 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.810
 We are crazy but the feeling is 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.520
 we 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.869
 we are among the four 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.850
 last for that reason I think there are teams 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:19.210
 worse with us it seems 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.100
 we are going to play here a field 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.170
 of prestige with a hobby delivered 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.140
 a team that has left once alone 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.810
 we live this time I already tell you we have done 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.030
 twice to the stick in the first part 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.740
 of its fortune components of 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.899
 aim that you have to have in many 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.790
 moments the second if the sporting has 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:39.289
 tight too much we have not been able to 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.670
 play the game on the strip of land 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:43.189
 that we wanted we played it 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.370
 10 meters further back we steal value no 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:49.220
 we have offensive transition we do not handle 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.870
 and when facing a sporting that squeezes 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.470
 a lot with his people pushing behind that 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.480
 it's one more engine 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.070
 I have been difficult but we have lacked a 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.680
 little bit to tie here to 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.570
 One if 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:04.020
 leave happy for the point achieved 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.760
 and could not be the only one who continues 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.020
 next Please 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.910
 the team if who keeps showing his 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.370
 level of recovery and this is what 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.080
 to stay 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.510
 we started a second round three 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.090
 parties we have six points and each each 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.260
 nine points we take six we're going to 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.450
 save as good what we have 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.769
 what to think now that we are going to tell us already 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.239
 we do not go part of the second round there 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.220
 let's lose we have lost from here 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:31.470
 where they have lost many teams 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.060
 and I'm telling you if every nine points each 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.940
 three parties make six what they do not 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.740
 we know what 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.330
 Let's look at the descent posts from afar 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:42.870
 but good is what 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.940
 is what I play today we are sad 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.350
 because we have put forward to 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.960
 start the second part I thought I was going to 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.930
 be the second part as the first 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.340
 but we were not able to 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.019
 to play that game that we 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.420
 we wanted and where we wanted in the strip 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:58.519
 of desired land then then the 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.260
 push the thrust of sporting sporting 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.810
 that I already tell you but once yes but one 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.650
 Once a team is not chance before its 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.650
 public delivered and 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.420
 and we have lost
