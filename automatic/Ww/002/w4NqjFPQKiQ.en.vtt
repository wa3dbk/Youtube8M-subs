00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:38.589 
roots wrapped snip which increases base

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:40.229 
roots wrapped snip which increases base
respond<00:00:39.010> slow<00:00:39.219> down<00:00:39.429> the<00:00:39.579> gang<00:00:39.789> garland

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
respond slow down the gang garland

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.380 
respond slow down the gang garland
increase<00:00:40.600> it<00:00:40.749> decreases<00:00:41.589> the<00:00:41.710> overall<00:00:42.010> game

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
increase it decreases the overall game

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.470 
increase it decreases the overall game
and<00:00:43.390> I<00:00:44.370> got<00:00:45.370> put<00:00:45.579> in<00:00:45.670> this<00:00:45.789> toggle<00:00:46.059> switches

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
and I got put in this toggle switches

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.619 
and I got put in this toggle switches
between<00:00:46.659> the<00:00:46.960> stock<00:00:47.230> silicon<00:00:48.129> diodes<00:00:48.489> and<00:00:48.670> LED

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
between the stock silicon diodes and LED

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:54.899 
between the stock silicon diodes and LED
lamp<00:00:49.870> those<00:00:51.300> lamb<00:00:52.300> I<00:00:53.010> totally<00:00:54.010> missed<00:00:54.339> it<00:00:54.460> BAM

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:54.909 
lamp those lamb I totally missed it BAM

00:00:54.909 --> 00:01:00.059 
lamp those lamb I totally missed it BAM
that's<00:00:55.780> better<00:00:57.870> okay<00:00:58.870> so<00:00:58.929> first<00:00:59.350> off<00:00:59.710> this<00:01:00.010> is

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:00.069 
that's better okay so first off this is

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:02.669 
that's better okay so first off this is
the<00:01:00.670> toggles<00:01:01.389> are<00:01:01.449> in<00:01:01.539> stock<00:01:01.870> positions<00:01:02.440> and

00:01:02.669 --> 00:01:02.679 
the toggles are in stock positions and

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:05.160 
the toggles are in stock positions and
this<00:01:03.429> is<00:01:03.550> just<00:01:03.760> what<00:01:03.969> a<00:01:03.999> brat<00:01:04.570> sounds<00:01:05.019> like

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
this is just what a brat sounds like

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:16.470 
this is just what a brat sounds like
when<00:01:05.409> you<00:01:05.500> change<00:01:05.770> the<00:01:05.920> off<00:01:06.040> hand<00:01:06.250> side

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:16.480 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:43.330 

I

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.410 

okay<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:45.230> that's<00:01:46.230> got<00:01:46.440> a<00:01:46.470> lot<00:01:46.680> less<00:01:47.420> nasty

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
okay so that's got a lot less nasty

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.390 
okay so that's got a lot less nasty
treble<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.680> normally<00:01:49.800> get<00:01:50.130> when<00:01:50.340> you

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
treble that you normally get when you

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.830 
treble that you normally get when you
have<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.670> fit<00:01:50.880> all<00:01:50.910> the<00:01:51.210> way<00:01:51.330> off<00:01:51.510> so<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.750> think

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
have to fit all the way off so I think

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.050 
have to fit all the way off so I think
the<00:01:52.170> op<00:01:52.290> amp<00:01:52.440> really<00:01:52.740> helps<00:01:53.040> with<00:01:53.190> that<00:01:53.220> right

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
the op amp really helps with that right

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.700 
the op amp really helps with that right
now<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.360> first<00:01:54.600> hole<00:01:54.900> which<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.500> roots

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
now the first hole which is the roots

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:18.500 
now the first hole which is the roots
mod<00:01:56.010> let's<00:01:56.400> give<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.850> out<00:02:01.430> of<00:02:02.430> pocket

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.420 

do<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:19.319> notice<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.620> decrease<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:19.950> game<00:02:20.250> but

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
do you notice to decrease the game but

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:28.160 
do you notice to decrease the game but
also<00:02:20.519> up<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.569> basis<00:02:22.409> for<00:02:26.780> so<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:27.870> can<00:02:28.019> get

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
also up to the basis for so you can get

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:35.100 
also up to the basis for so you can get
more<00:02:28.230> usable<00:02:29.010> mid<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.849> low<00:02:30.000> gain<00:02:30.239> sound

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:42.780 

there's<00:02:36.110> a<00:02:36.170> lot<00:02:36.349> of<00:02:36.459> high<00:02:37.459> frequency<00:02:37.670> content

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.229 

but<00:02:43.790> she<00:02:43.940> can<00:02:44.090> dial<00:02:44.300> out<00:02:45.970> but<00:02:46.970> the<00:02:47.060> whole<00:02:47.209> thing

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
but she can dial out but the whole thing

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.449 
but she can dial out but the whole thing
always<00:02:47.959> sounds<00:02:49.569> pretty<00:02:50.569> full<00:02:50.959> pretty<00:02:51.890> thin

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
always sounds pretty full pretty thin

00:02:52.459 --> 00:03:01.570

sorry<00:02:52.819> for<00:02:53.330> with<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.569> roots<00:02:54.260> mode<00:02:54.530> on

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:09.730 

get<00:03:02.450> some<00:03:02.600> nice<00:03:02.810> full

sounds you still got a big gang in the
shopping

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.509 

so<00:03:28.780> yeah<00:03:28.989> basically<00:03:29.290> so<00:03:30.129> that's<00:03:30.280> what<00:03:30.430> the

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
so yeah basically so that's what the

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.570 
so yeah basically so that's what the
roots<00:03:30.730> map<00:03:31.590> mod<00:03:32.590> on<00:03:32.769> I<00:03:32.800> think<00:03:32.980> it<00:03:33.220> turns<00:03:33.459> it

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
roots map mod on I think it turns it

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.960 
roots map mod on I think it turns it
into<00:03:33.700> kind<00:03:33.940> of<00:03:34.060> like<00:03:34.269> more<00:03:34.690> useful<00:03:35.170> pedal

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
into kind of like more useful pedal

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.490 
into kind of like more useful pedal
overdrive<00:03:36.970> sounds<00:03:37.360> out<00:03:37.480> of<00:03:37.510> it<00:03:37.690> start<00:03:38.019> but

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
overdrive sounds out of it start but

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.690 
overdrive sounds out of it start but
good<00:03:38.620> type<00:03:38.800> of<00:03:38.920> switchable<00:03:39.250> because<00:03:39.489> then<00:03:39.610> you

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
good type of switchable because then you

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.740 
good type of switchable because then you
can<00:03:39.849> always<00:03:40.150> go<00:03:40.330> back<00:03:40.360> to<00:03:40.599> this<00:03:40.870> full<00:03:41.110> bloody

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.160 

rats<00:03:46.750> screen<00:03:47.290> now<00:03:47.860> this<00:03:48.250> one<00:03:48.549> is<00:03:48.760> diode<00:03:49.510> toggle

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
rats screen now this one is diode toggle

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.809 
rats screen now this one is diode toggle
when<00:03:50.620> I<00:03:50.650> flipped<00:03:50.980> that<00:03:51.099> two<00:03:51.250> diodes<00:03:51.459> the

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
when I flipped that two diodes the

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.070 
when I flipped that two diodes the
volume<00:03:52.090> is<00:03:52.180> going<00:03:52.239> to<00:03:52.360> go<00:03:52.450> up<00:03:52.480> the<00:03:52.780> gain<00:03:52.959> is

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
volume is going to go up the gain is

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.270 
volume is going to go up the gain is
going<00:03:53.230> to<00:03:53.290> go<00:03:53.379> down<00:03:53.410> the<00:03:53.739> compression<00:03:54.190> is

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
going to go down the compression is

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.729 
going to go down the compression is
going<00:03:54.400> to<00:03:54.459> go<00:03:54.580> down<00:03:54.610> so<00:03:55.239> I'm<00:03:55.330> going<00:03:55.540> to<00:03:55.739> like

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
going to go down so I'm going to like

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.860 
going to go down so I'm going to like
adjust<00:03:56.920> with<00:03:57.400> the<00:03:57.579> volume<00:03:58.000> before<00:03:58.420> I<00:03:58.630> switch

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
adjust with the volume before I switch

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.410 
adjust with the volume before I switch
it<00:03:59.049> on<00:03:59.200> the<00:03:59.349> side<00:03:59.590> let's<00:03:59.890> hear<00:04:00.160> some<00:04:00.420> stuff

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
it on the side let's hear some stuff

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:37.129 
it on the side let's hear some stuff
before<00:04:04.739> Alf<00:04:05.739> bars<00:04:06.250> can<00:04:06.579> be<00:04:06.610> played

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.070 

stay<00:04:38.139> oh<00:04:38.169> it's<00:04:38.620> more<00:04:39.240> this<00:04:40.240> is<00:04:40.389> with<00:04:40.539> Max<00:04:40.779> game

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
stay oh it's more this is with Max game

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:48.589 
stay oh it's more this is with Max game
goodbye

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:48.599 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:51.300 

you<00:04:49.599> notice<00:04:49.960> is<00:04:50.080> less<00:04:50.500> compressed<00:04:51.039> and

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
you notice is less compressed and

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:58.969 
you notice is less compressed and
there's<00:04:51.520> more<00:04:52.050> more<00:04:53.050> bass<00:04:53.319> in<00:04:53.530> there<00:04:53.710> as<00:04:53.830> well

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:06.040 

gets<00:04:59.979> a<00:05:00.069> bit<00:05:00.159> travel<00:05:00.490> years<00:05:00.699> ago

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.450 

you<00:05:07.050> can<00:05:07.259> figure<00:05:07.440> out<00:05:07.560> with<00:05:07.740> the<00:05:07.830> pillow<00:05:08.190> knob

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
you can figure out with the pillow knob

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.390 
you can figure out with the pillow knob
or<00:05:09.229> flip<00:05:10.229> on<00:05:10.379> the<00:05:10.410> rats<00:05:10.650> again<00:05:10.949> the<00:05:11.190> roots

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
or flip on the rats again the roots

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:22.120 
or flip on the rats again the roots
again

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:27.320 

so<00:05:23.130> with<00:05:23.730> your<00:05:23.970> LEDs<00:05:24.840> and<00:05:25.080> your<00:05:25.560> route<00:05:26.330> right

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
so with your LEDs and your route right

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.910 
so with your LEDs and your route right
on<00:05:27.510> they're<00:05:27.690> both<00:05:27.870> kind<00:05:28.230> of<00:05:28.290> reduce<00:05:28.590> the<00:05:28.740> gain

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:28.920 
on they're both kind of reduce the gain

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.010 
on they're both kind of reduce the gain
so<00:05:29.190> you<00:05:29.250> get<00:05:29.490> a<00:05:29.520> lot<00:05:29.760> more<00:05:29.820> range<00:05:30.570> in<00:05:30.870> that

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
so you get a lot more range in that

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:39.790 
so you get a lot more range in that
lower<00:05:31.230> gayness<00:05:31.710> or<00:05:31.860> so

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.730 

me

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:57.320 

I

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.749 

you

00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:03.560 

so<00:06:00.759> yeah<00:06:00.940> I<00:06:01.360> think<00:06:01.960> overall<00:06:02.320> adds<00:06:02.650> to<00:06:03.009> the

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
so yeah I think overall adds to the

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.909 
so yeah I think overall adds to the
flexibility<00:06:04.570> of<00:06:04.600> the<00:06:04.660> pillow<00:06:04.900> and<00:06:05.199> makes<00:06:05.800> it

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:05.919 
flexibility of the pillow and makes it

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:07.320 
flexibility of the pillow and makes it
into<00:06:06.009> something<00:06:06.400> that<00:06:06.580> it<00:06:06.850> certainly<00:06:07.150> isn't

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
into something that it certainly isn't

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.270 
into something that it certainly isn't
to<00:06:07.540> start<00:06:07.810> with<00:06:07.990> which<00:06:08.530> is<00:06:08.680> a<00:06:08.710> really<00:06:08.979> first

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 
to start with which is a really first

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.550 
to start with which is a really first
I'll<00:06:09.520> box<00:06:09.729> that<00:06:10.000> can<00:06:10.090> go<00:06:10.270> anywhere<00:06:10.930> from<00:06:11.110> clean

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 
I'll box that can go anywhere from clean

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.529 
I'll box that can go anywhere from clean
boost<00:06:11.830> all<00:06:12.190> the<00:06:12.430> way<00:06:12.580> to<00:06:12.639> manic<00:06:13.240> crazy

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:13.539 
boost all the way to manic crazy

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:16.440 
boost all the way to manic crazy
distortion
