00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
about to suggest another possibility

about to suggest another possibility
purely<00:02:24.630> speculation<00:02:25.080> I'll<00:02:25.320> give<00:02:25.440> you<00:02:25.560> one

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
purely speculation I'll give you one

purely speculation I'll give you one
minute<00:02:25.950> hang<00:02:26.340> on<00:02:26.490> I<00:02:26.580> have<00:02:26.730> another<00:02:26.940> question

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
minute hang on I have another question

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.190 
minute hang on I have another question
okay<00:02:28.640> III<00:02:29.640> think<00:02:29.940> that<00:02:30.390> President<00:02:30.570> Obama<00:02:30.870> is

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
okay III think that President Obama is

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.450 
okay III think that President Obama is
well<00:02:31.380> aware<00:02:31.560> this<00:02:31.620> an<00:02:31.830> extraterrestrial

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
well aware this an extraterrestrial

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.920 
well aware this an extraterrestrial
presence<00:02:32.580> admitted<00:02:33.240> he<00:02:33.360> was<00:02:33.390> roughly<00:02:33.690> tipped

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
presence admitted he was roughly tipped

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.260 
presence admitted he was roughly tipped
off<00:02:34.110> by<00:02:34.140> John<00:02:34.620> Podesta<00:02:34.910> but<00:02:35.910> he<00:02:35.970> can't<00:02:36.150> do

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
off by John Podesta but he can't do

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.650 
off by John Podesta but he can't do
anything<00:02:36.450> about<00:02:36.660> it<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.910> so<00:02:38.910> when<00:02:39.090> we<00:02:39.120> we

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
anything about it and so when we we

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.330 
anything about it and so when we we
successfully<00:02:40.410> petitioned<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:40.980> White<00:02:41.160> House

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
successfully petitioned the White House

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.180 
successfully petitioned the White House
and<00:02:41.610> they<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:42.300> they<00:02:42.360> had<00:02:42.570> to<00:02:42.690> respond<00:02:43.190> it's

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
and they and they had to respond it's

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.010 
and they and they had to respond it's
possible<00:02:44.730> that<00:02:44.880> they<00:02:45.030> gave<00:02:45.210> such<00:02:45.540> a<00:02:45.690> rigid

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
possible that they gave such a rigid

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.980 
possible that they gave such a rigid
fixed<00:02:47.010> almost<00:02:47.520> indefensible<00:02:48.000> position<00:02:48.360> not

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
fixed almost indefensible position not

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.560 
fixed almost indefensible position not
because<00:02:49.740> they're<00:02:49.860> ignorant<00:02:50.270> but<00:02:51.270> because

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
because they're ignorant but because

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.060 
because they're ignorant but because
that<00:02:51.690> was<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:51.959> best<00:02:52.170> they<00:02:52.410> could<00:02:52.470> do<00:02:52.830> to<00:02:53.040> help

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
that was the best they could do to help

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.430 
that was the best they could do to help
us<00:02:53.430> out<00:02:53.580> as<00:02:54.570> opposed<00:02:54.900> to<00:02:54.990> a<00:02:55.020> wishy-washy

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
us out as opposed to a wishy-washy

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.630 
us out as opposed to a wishy-washy
statement<00:02:55.980> they<00:02:56.040> could<00:02:56.160> have<00:02:56.250> danced<00:02:56.520> around

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
statement they could have danced around

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.699 
statement they could have danced around
and<00:02:57.090> by<00:02:57.630> giving<00:02:57.780> in<00:02:57.990> such<00:02:58.140> a<00:02:58.170> fixed<00:02:58.590> position

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
and by giving in such a fixed position

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.310 
and by giving in such a fixed position
like<00:02:59.130> that<00:02:59.160> we<00:02:59.490> can<00:02:59.670> pound<00:03:00.000> we<00:03:00.750> could<00:03:00.930> break<00:03:01.110> it

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
like that we can pound we could break it

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.750 
like that we can pound we could break it
and<00:03:01.350> if<00:03:01.620> we<00:03:01.740> break<00:03:01.950> it<00:03:02.130> we<00:03:02.280> break<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.580> truth

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
and if we break it we break the truth

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.570 
and if we break it we break the truth
embargo<00:03:02.970> so<00:03:03.450> it's<00:03:04.110> just<00:03:04.440> possible<00:03:04.709> that<00:03:05.010> the

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
embargo so it's just possible that the

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.580 
embargo so it's just possible that the
opposite<00:03:06.030> interpretation<00:03:06.720> is<00:03:06.840> that<00:03:06.870> this<00:03:07.350> is

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
opposite interpretation is that this is

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.040 
opposite interpretation is that this is
administration<00:03:08.280> trying<00:03:08.820> to<00:03:09.390> have<00:03:09.630> helped<00:03:09.870> us

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
administration trying to have helped us

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.890 
administration trying to have helped us
reach<00:03:10.470> in<00:03:10.800> to<00:03:11.040> help<00:03:11.190> them<00:03:11.490> I<00:03:11.790> just<00:03:12.570> throw<00:03:12.750> that

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
reach in to help them I just throw that

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.110 
reach in to help them I just throw that
out<00:03:12.959> because<00:03:13.740> these<00:03:14.310> things<00:03:14.580> are<00:03:14.790> so<00:03:14.970> much

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
out because these things are so much

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.290 
out because these things are so much
more<00:03:15.180> complicated<00:03:15.630> than<00:03:15.959> you<00:03:16.020> might<00:03:16.110> think
