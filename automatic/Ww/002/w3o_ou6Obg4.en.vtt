00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
little bit overwhelmed so it's best if

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.440

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.839 

let's<00:02:09.530> stick<00:02:09.679> with<00:02:09.830> that<00:02:09.950> same<00:02:10.190> idea<00:02:10.429> and

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
let's stick with that same idea and

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:12.610 
let's stick with that same idea and
let's<00:02:11.420> cycle<00:02:11.780> through<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.019> pickups<00:02:12.349> here<00:02:12.560> we
