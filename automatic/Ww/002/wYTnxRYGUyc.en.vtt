never really liked that leather style
never<00:04:46.949> I<00:04:48.380> accepted<00:04:49.380> on<00:04:49.500> the<00:04:49.530> dome<00:04:49.770> go<00:04:49.979> because

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
never I accepted on the dome go because

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.580 
never I accepted on the dome go because
that<00:04:50.460> was<00:04:50.639> the<00:04:51.060> original<00:04:51.509> but<00:04:52.139> other<00:04:52.349> than

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
that was the original but other than

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.020 
that was the original but other than
that<00:04:52.650> I've<00:04:52.919> never<00:04:53.099> really<00:04:53.370> been<00:04:53.400> a<00:04:53.520> big<00:04:53.610> fan<00:04:54.000> of

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
that I've never really been a big fan of

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.749 
that I've never really been a big fan of
it<00:04:54.270> so<00:04:54.660> I'm<00:04:54.750> questioning<00:04:54.990> whether<00:04:55.289> it's<00:04:55.440> habit

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:55.759 
it so I'm questioning whether it's habit

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:58.370 
it so I'm questioning whether it's habit
double<00:04:56.759> aced<00:04:56.940> or<00:04:57.720> whether<00:04:57.930> just<00:04:58.169> have<00:04:58.259> it

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
double aced or whether just have it
