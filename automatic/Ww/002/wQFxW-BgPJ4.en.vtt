00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.090 
I believe are all viable just some more
than<00:00:36.630> others<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:36.960> it<00:00:37.230> all<00:00:37.350> really<00:00:37.530> depends<00:00:37.980> on

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
than others and it all really depends on

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.100 
than others and it all really depends on

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
back then when I mentioned this bill

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.849

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
does that changes were very very recent

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.619 
does that changes were very very recent
so<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.070> was<00:00:59.250> kind<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.579> speculating<00:01:00.270> as<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.390> what

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
so I was kind of speculating as to what

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.389 
so I was kind of speculating as to what
I<00:01:00.660> think<00:01:00.930> will<00:01:01.079> truly<00:01:01.410> be<00:01:01.530> strong<00:01:01.890> now<00:01:02.160> don't

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
I think will truly be strong now don't

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.889 
I think will truly be strong now don't
get<00:01:02.489> me<00:01:02.609> wrong<00:01:02.640> this<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.149> still<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.359> great<00:01:03.629> build

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
get me wrong this is still a great build

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.660 
get me wrong this is still a great build
it<00:01:04.019> just<00:01:04.199> really<00:01:04.439> depends<00:01:04.860> on<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.070> player<00:01:05.400> and

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
it just really depends on the player and

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.490 
it just really depends on the player and
the<00:01:05.760> place<00:01:05.970> out<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.510> enjoy<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:07.140> just

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
the place out that you enjoy I just

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.080 
the place out that you enjoy I just
realized<00:01:07.830> later<00:01:08.100> on<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.430> really<00:01:08.760> do<00:01:08.909> like

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
realized later on that I really do like

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.670 
realized later on that I really do like
a<00:01:09.150> blade<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.540> ruined<00:01:09.720> King<00:01:09.960> on<00:01:10.110> zet<00:01:10.409> so<00:01:10.619> I

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
a blade of the ruined King on zet so I

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.230 
a blade of the ruined King on zet so I
decided<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.189> stick<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.700> make<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:11.939> build

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
decided to stick to it and make a build

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.820 
decided to stick to it and make a build
around<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.689> I'll<00:01:12.869> go<00:01:12.990> over<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.350> build<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.650> bit

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
around it I'll go over that build a bit

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.440 
around it I'll go over that build a bit
later<00:01:14.040> but<00:01:14.280> talking<00:01:14.520> about<00:01:14.850> this<00:01:15.060> one<00:01:15.299> you

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
later but talking about this one you

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.090 
later but talking about this one you
want<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.780> go<00:01:15.900> for<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.140> raw<00:01:16.439> damage<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.070> the

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.070 
want to go for the raw damage and the
whole<00:01:17.340> point<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.790> get<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.180> spike<00:01:18.570> damage<00:01:18.960> a

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
whole point is to get the spike damage a

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.870 
whole point is to get the spike damage a
lot<00:01:19.259> sooner<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.860> only<00:01:20.070> recommend<00:01:20.430> doing<00:01:20.729> this

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
lot sooner I only recommend doing this

second<00:02:30.150> build<00:02:30.299> of<00:02:30.480> this<00:02:30.599> video<00:02:30.989> which<00:02:31.140> is<00:02:31.170> also

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
second build of this video which is also

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.770 
second build of this video which is also
my<00:02:31.799> second<00:02:32.280> most<00:02:32.430> favorite<00:02:32.640> build<00:02:33.030> as<00:02:33.239> well<00:02:33.510> I

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
my second most favorite build as well I

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.449 
my second most favorite build as well I
title<00:02:34.230> this<00:02:34.349> one<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.680> old<00:02:34.829> school<00:02:35.190> Zed

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
title this one the old school Zed

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:36.949 
title this one the old school Zed
because<00:02:35.819> this<00:02:36.000> is<00:02:36.120> simply<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.510> build<00:02:36.750> you'll

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
because this is simply the build you'll

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.410 
because this is simply the build you'll
see<00:02:37.200> most<00:02:37.530> sets<00:02:37.860> do<00:02:38.069> especially<00:02:38.489> in<00:02:38.819> LCS<00:02:39.180> in

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
see most sets do especially in LCS in

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.059 
see most sets do especially in LCS in
high-level<00:02:39.810> play<00:02:40.049> but<00:02:40.440> before<00:02:40.709> we<00:02:40.829> go<00:02:40.950> into

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
high-level play but before we go into

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.619 
high-level play but before we go into
the<00:02:41.220> pros<00:02:41.430> and<00:02:41.459> cons<00:02:41.819> of<00:02:41.939> this<00:02:42.000> build<00:02:42.359> let's

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
the pros and cons of this build let's

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.360 
the pros and cons of this build let's
talk<00:02:42.780> about<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.109> bill<00:02:43.290> path<00:02:43.500> itself<00:02:43.890> so<00:02:44.310> you

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
talk about the bill path itself so you

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.830 
talk about the bill path itself so you
typically<00:02:44.760> do<00:02:45.000> when<00:02:45.150> they<00:02:45.239> get<00:02:45.359> the<00:02:45.480> colors

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
typically do when they get the colors

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.839 
typically do when they get the colors
first<00:02:46.049> get<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.590> brutalizer<00:02:47.010> going<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.609> then

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
first get the brutalizer going and then

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.039 
first get the brutalizer going and then
either<00:02:47.970> finish<00:02:48.420> your<00:02:48.540> blade<00:02:48.720> of<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:48.840> ruined

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
either finish your blade of the ruined

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:50.899 
either finish your blade of the ruined
king<00:02:49.349> or<00:02:49.560> get<00:02:49.890> your<00:02:50.010> choice<00:02:50.220> of<00:02:50.430> boots<00:02:50.700> like

lucidity<00:02:51.420> mobility<00:02:52.319> merc<00:02:52.889> boots<00:02:53.159> then<00:02:53.489> make

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
lucidity mobility merc boots then make

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.979 
lucidity mobility merc boots then make

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
king are finished if they are not then

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.819 
king are finished if they are not then

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
work towards last whisper and top it off

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:01.069 
work towards last whisper and top it off

with a beautiful infinity edge infinity

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:02.930 
with a beautiful infinity edge infinity
edge<00:03:01.200> in<00:03:01.349> your<00:03:01.590> most<00:03:01.769> works<00:03:02.099> so<00:03:02.459> well<00:03:02.489> together

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
edge in your most works so well together

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.640 
edge in your most works so well together
because<00:03:03.299> you<00:03:03.480> get<00:03:03.690> so<00:03:03.750> much<00:03:04.049> good<00:03:04.319> chance<00:03:04.500> from

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
because you get so much good chance from

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.530 
because you get so much good chance from
the<00:03:04.769> to<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.280> Yama's<00:03:05.639> active<00:03:06.030> effect<00:03:06.329> makes

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
the to the Yama's active effect makes

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.879 
the to the Yama's active effect makes
you<00:03:06.629> attack<00:03:06.930> more<00:03:07.290> so<00:03:07.409> you<00:03:07.500> have<00:03:07.590> a<00:03:07.620> higher

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:07.889 
you attack more so you have a higher

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:09.619 
you attack more so you have a higher
chance<00:03:07.920> of<00:03:08.400> creating<00:03:08.609> overall<00:03:09.120> and<00:03:09.359> in<00:03:09.540> all

chance of creating overall and in all
honesty<00:03:09.659> this<00:03:10.200> is<00:03:10.349> just<00:03:10.560> a<00:03:10.680> great<00:03:10.889> build<00:03:11.159> so

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
honesty this is just a great build so

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.129 
honesty this is just a great build so
let's<00:03:11.639> quickly<00:03:11.730> go<00:03:12.060> over<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.510> pros<00:03:12.720> and<00:03:12.930> cons

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139 
let's quickly go over the pros and cons

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:15.080 
let's quickly go over the pros and cons
like<00:03:13.379> I<00:03:13.530> said<00:03:13.769> a<00:03:13.920> very<00:03:14.159> standard<00:03:14.519> build<00:03:14.940> you'll

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
like I said a very standard build you'll

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.449 
like I said a very standard build you'll
see<00:03:15.269> most<00:03:15.540> let's<00:03:15.810> do<00:03:16.109> and<00:03:16.379> it<00:03:16.590> just<00:03:16.769> works<00:03:17.010> this

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
see most let's do and it just works this

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.759 
see most let's do and it just works this
is<00:03:17.609> probably<00:03:17.879> the<00:03:18.090> best<00:03:18.660> dueling<00:03:19.260> and<00:03:19.440> split

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
is probably the best dueling and split

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.470 
is probably the best dueling and split
pushing<00:03:19.980> build<00:03:20.370> out<00:03:20.549> of<00:03:20.730> all<00:03:20.970> three<00:03:21.209> of<00:03:21.299> them

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
pushing build out of all three of them

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.000 
pushing build out of all three of them
because<00:03:21.750> you<00:03:21.870> have<00:03:21.989> so<00:03:22.199> much<00:03:22.319> attack<00:03:22.739> speed

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
because you have so much attack speed

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.650 
because you have so much attack speed
your<00:03:23.220> yom<00:03:23.459> assembly<00:03:23.879> of<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.030> room<00:03:24.209> king<00:03:24.449> are

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
your yom assembly of the room king are

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.020 
your yom assembly of the room king are
simply<00:03:25.139> designed<00:03:25.709> to<00:03:25.980> duel<00:03:26.220> someone<00:03:26.519> now<00:03:26.970> i'm

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
simply designed to duel someone now i'm

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.610 
simply designed to duel someone now i'm
sure<00:03:27.209> most<00:03:27.359> of<00:03:27.510> you<00:03:27.569> are<00:03:27.750> asking<00:03:27.959> one<00:03:28.410> would<00:03:28.590> i

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
sure most of you are asking one would i

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.349 
sure most of you are asking one would i
choose<00:03:28.889> this<00:03:29.190> build<00:03:29.489> over<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.790> other<00:03:30.060> ones

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
choose this build over the other ones

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:31.759 
choose this build over the other ones
well<00:03:30.660> if<00:03:30.780> i<00:03:30.870> see<00:03:31.019> that<00:03:31.169> i'll<00:03:31.260> be<00:03:31.319> split<00:03:31.620> pushing

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
well if i see that i'll be split pushing

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.289 
well if i see that i'll be split pushing
a<00:03:31.949> lot<00:03:32.099> this<00:03:32.340> game<00:03:32.549> and<00:03:32.669> there's<00:03:32.819> not<00:03:32.940> really<00:03:33.180> a

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
a lot this game and there's not really a

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.059 
a lot this game and there's not really a
whole<00:03:33.389> lot<00:03:33.599> of<00:03:33.750> clumped<00:03:34.319> up<00:03:34.410> teamfights<00:03:34.919> that

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
whole lot of clumped up teamfights that

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:36.470 
whole lot of clumped up teamfights that
will<00:03:35.160> probably<00:03:35.400> happen<00:03:35.609> based<00:03:36.239> on<00:03:36.389> the

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
will probably happen based on the

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.180 
will probably happen based on the
champions<00:03:36.900> pick<00:03:37.230> then<00:03:37.500> typically<00:03:37.859> this<00:03:38.040> is

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
champions pick then typically this is

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.890 
champions pick then typically this is
the<00:03:38.310> build<00:03:38.489> of<00:03:38.669> choice<00:03:38.879> for<00:03:39.150> me<00:03:39.359> now<00:03:39.720> even

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
the build of choice for me now even

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.390 
the build of choice for me now even
though<00:03:40.109> i<00:03:40.139> truly<00:03:40.620> believe<00:03:40.859> this<00:03:41.040> build<00:03:41.280> is

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
though i truly believe this build is

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.129 
though i truly believe this build is
probably<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:42.030> worst<00:03:42.060> of<00:03:42.449> the<00:03:42.599> three<00:03:42.629> when<00:03:43.019> it

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
probably the worst of the three when it

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:44.539 
probably the worst of the three when it
comes<00:03:43.319> to<00:03:43.470> teamfights<00:03:43.919> around<00:03:44.220> there<00:03:44.340> early

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
comes to teamfights around there early

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.009 
comes to teamfights around there early
to<00:03:44.730> mid<00:03:44.910> game<00:03:45.060> unless<00:03:45.389> you<00:03:45.449> just<00:03:45.660> play<00:03:45.900> it<00:03:45.930> very

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
to mid game unless you just play it very

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.930 
to mid game unless you just play it very
well<00:03:46.440> on<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:46.799> flip<00:03:47.040> side<00:03:47.069> once<00:03:47.609> you<00:03:47.699> get<00:03:47.819> the

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
well on the flip side once you get the

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.180 
well on the flip side once you get the
last<00:03:48.150> whisper<00:03:48.480> and<00:03:48.840> especially<00:03:49.349> the<00:03:49.680> infinity

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
last whisper and especially the infinity

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.849 
last whisper and especially the infinity
edge<00:03:50.220> your<00:03:50.760> damage<00:03:51.209> absolutely<00:03:52.109> skyrockets

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
edge your damage absolutely skyrockets

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:54.800 
edge your damage absolutely skyrockets
and<00:03:52.980> your<00:03:53.280> mid<00:03:53.459> to<00:03:53.639> late<00:03:53.879> game<00:03:54.180> is<00:03:54.209> among<00:03:54.690> the

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
and your mid to late game is among the

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.300 
and your mid to late game is among the
best<00:03:54.840> of<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:55.379> three<00:03:55.560> bills<00:03:55.799> because

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
best of the three bills because

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.710 
best of the three bills because
eventually<00:03:56.609> you<00:03:56.849> get<00:03:57.030> to<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:57.269> point<00:03:57.480> where

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
eventually you get to the point where

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.330 
eventually you get to the point where
every<00:03:57.959> single<00:03:58.260> auto-attack<00:03:58.739> hurts<00:03:59.099> and<00:03:59.280> you

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
every single auto-attack hurts and you

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.580 
every single auto-attack hurts and you
simply<00:03:59.790> just<00:03:59.940> do<00:04:00.329> not<00:04:00.510> rely<00:04:00.989> on<00:04:01.260> your<00:04:01.409> death

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
simply just do not rely on your death

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.140 
simply just do not rely on your death
mark<00:04:01.829> for<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:02.040> damage<00:04:02.459> so<00:04:02.760> when<00:04:02.909> they<00:04:03.030> get

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
mark for the damage so when they get

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.030 
mark for the damage so when they get
infinity<00:04:03.690> edge<00:04:03.810> when<00:04:04.169> they<00:04:04.290> get<00:04:04.409> the<00:04:04.530> Q<00:04:04.709> assess

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
infinity edge when they get the Q assess

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.680 
infinity edge when they get the Q assess
you're<00:04:05.280> like<00:04:05.430> well<00:04:05.639> that's<00:04:05.909> pretty<00:04:06.150> cool<00:04:06.359> but

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
it into one big build so with this build

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.620 
it into one big build so with this build
the<00:04:58.800> bill<00:04:59.039> path<00:04:59.250> itself<00:04:59.610> can<00:04:59.940> differ<00:05:00.360> your

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
the bill path itself can differ your

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.120 
the bill path itself can differ your
first<00:05:00.840> option<00:05:01.050> is<00:05:01.289> just<00:05:01.350> like<00:05:01.680> the<00:05:01.800> second
