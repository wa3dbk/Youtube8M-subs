we<00:01:00.000> are<00:01:00.120> in<00:01:00.300> Sochi<00:01:00.600> today<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.050> it's<00:01:01.379> definitely

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
we are in Sochi today so it's definitely

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.990 
we are in Sochi today so it's definitely
very<00:01:02.039> important<00:01:03.260> to<00:01:04.260> make<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:05.070> people<00:01:05.250> aware

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
very important to make the people aware

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.340 
very important to make the people aware
of<00:01:06.060> from<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.570> one<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.930> they<00:01:07.020> have<00:01:07.200> to

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
of from the one and they have to

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.960 
of from the one and they have to
understand<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.890> before<00:01:08.010> we<00:01:08.280> do<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.549> racetrack

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
understand it before we do the racetrack

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.420 
understand it before we do the racetrack
I<00:01:09.000> reckon<00:01:09.450> because<00:01:09.750> like<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.830> success

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
I reckon because like that the success

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.690 
I reckon because like that the success
would<00:01:11.640> be<00:01:11.670> definitely<00:01:11.939> be<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.720> lot<00:01:13.110> bigger<00:01:13.700> what

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
would be definitely be a lot bigger what

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.080 
would be definitely be a lot bigger what
does<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:14.909> mean<00:01:15.180> for<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.540> as<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.840> file<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.439> other

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.280 
rush into a horse it make the racist
more<00:01:26.040> interesting<00:01:26.700> or<00:01:26.970> more<00:01:27.330> your<00:01:27.840> schedules

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
more interesting or more your schedules

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.700 
more interesting or more your schedules
more<00:01:28.500> narrow<00:01:28.800> I<00:01:29.360> think<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.570> at<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.530> end<00:01:31.650> of

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
more narrow I think that at the end of

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.890 
more narrow I think that at the end of
the<00:01:31.830> day<00:01:32.010> we<00:01:32.220> love<00:01:32.400> racing<00:01:32.940> all<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.450> drivers

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
the day we love racing all the drivers

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.570 
the day we love racing all the drivers
you<00:01:34.230> know<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.620> don't<00:01:34.890> mind<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.220> have<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.370> race

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
you know so I don't mind to have a race

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.260 
you know so I don't mind to have a race
more<00:01:35.910> obviously<00:01:37.160> the<00:01:38.160> calendar<00:01:38.640> starts<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.150> be

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
more obviously the calendar starts to be

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.570 
more obviously the calendar starts to be
a<00:01:39.300> very<00:01:39.840> tight<00:01:40.200> we've<00:01:40.500> got<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.710> lot<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:40.920> races<00:01:41.400> to

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
a very tight we've got a lot of races to

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.240 
a very tight we've got a lot of races to
fit<00:01:41.790> in<00:01:42.000> but<00:01:42.030> in<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.930> end<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.110> reckon<00:01:43.410> that<00:01:43.590> one

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
fit in but in the end I reckon that one

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.610 
fit in but in the end I reckon that one
more<00:01:44.430> race<00:01:44.610> will<00:01:44.820> not<00:01:44.850> be<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.120> problem<00:01:45.300> and<00:01:45.690> if

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
more race will not be a problem and if

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.350 
more race will not be a problem and if

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
very difficult to say if the new updates

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.540 
very difficult to say if the new updates
will<00:02:33.720> will<00:02:34.380> make<00:02:34.560> us<00:02:34.740> better<00:02:34.950> or<00:02:35.160> not<00:02:35.190> because

will will make us better or not because
you<00:02:35.790> don't<00:02:35.970> know<00:02:36.090> what<00:02:36.270> the<00:02:36.300> other<00:02:36.570> teams<00:02:36.780> are

you don't know what the other teams are
doing<00:02:36.959> but<00:02:37.380> I<00:02:37.680> reckon<00:02:38.430> that<00:02:38.610> it<00:02:39.209> can<00:02:39.390> still

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
doing but I reckon that it can still

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.570 
doing but I reckon that it can still
help<00:02:39.780> us<00:02:39.959> because<00:02:40.410> we<00:02:40.590> we<00:02:41.040> went<00:02:41.280> on<00:02:41.550> a

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
help us because we we went on a

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.970 
help us because we we went on a
completely<00:02:42.060> new<00:02:42.390> design<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:43.170> car<00:02:43.410> and

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
completely new design of car and

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.410 
completely new design of car and
obviously<00:02:44.250> it<00:02:44.459> takes<00:02:44.550> a<00:02:44.700> little<00:02:44.820> bit<00:02:45.060> of<00:02:45.120> time

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
obviously it takes a little bit of time

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.380 
obviously it takes a little bit of time
to<00:02:45.570> get<00:02:45.690> used<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:46.110> it<00:02:46.140> so<00:02:47.010> I<00:02:47.580> think<00:02:47.940> we<00:02:48.270> will

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
to get used to it so I think we will

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.670 
to get used to it so I think we will
really<00:02:48.750> see<00:02:48.930> that<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.230> car<00:02:49.440> is<00:02:49.560> getting

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
really see that the car is getting

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.979 
really see that the car is getting
better<00:02:49.950> too<00:02:50.160> at<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.520> end<00:02:50.610> of<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.790> year<00:02:50.840> so<00:02:51.840> in

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989

the same league right now is the

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.000 
the same league right now is the
strategy<00:03:40.510> raising<00:03:41.510> strategy<00:03:42.019> after<00:03:42.170> arosa<00:03:42.680> or

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
strategy raising strategy after arosa or

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.979 
strategy raising strategy after arosa or
and<00:03:43.400> red<00:03:43.610> bull<00:03:43.790> racing<00:03:43.940> are<00:03:44.480> they<00:03:44.540> different

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
and red bull racing are they different

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.490 
and red bull racing are they different
or<00:03:45.880> sometimes<00:03:46.880> you<00:03:47.030> are<00:03:47.120> testing<00:03:47.600> their<00:03:47.810> know

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
or sometimes you are testing their know

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.990 
or sometimes you are testing their know
they<00:03:48.769> are<00:03:48.890> completely<00:03:49.190> different<00:03:49.819> because

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
they are completely different because

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.699 
they are completely different because
obviously<00:03:50.360> the<00:03:50.780> team<00:03:51.019> are<00:03:51.200> completely

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
obviously the team are completely

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.009 
obviously the team are completely
separate<00:03:52.160> now<00:03:52.400> and<00:03:52.730> we<00:03:53.420> cannot<00:03:53.750> share

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
separate now and we cannot share

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:55.600 
separate now and we cannot share
anything<00:03:54.350> like<00:03:54.680> we<00:03:54.800> used<00:03:55.010> to<00:03:55.130> do<00:03:55.220> in<00:03:55.280> the<00:03:55.400> past

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
anything like we used to do in the past

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.840 
anything like we used to do in the past
but<00:03:56.300> at<00:03:57.200> the<00:03:57.410> end<00:03:57.440> of<00:03:57.590> the<00:03:57.739> day<00:03:57.920> it<00:03:58.430> depends

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
but at the end of the day it depends

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.819 
but at the end of the day it depends
also<00:03:59.000> where<00:03:59.299> you<00:03:59.420> start<00:03:59.720> if<00:04:00.200> you<00:04:00.320> start<00:04:00.560> at<00:04:00.769> the

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
also where you start if you start at the

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:03.009 
also where you start if you start at the
top<00:04:01.130> of<00:04:01.190> the<00:04:01.400> grid<00:04:01.640> or<00:04:01.970> in<00:04:02.090> the<00:04:02.180> middle<00:04:02.510> it

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
top of the grid or in the middle it

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:04.900 
top of the grid or in the middle it
makes<00:04:03.680> a<00:04:03.769> bit<00:04:03.890> of<00:04:04.010> a<00:04:04.070> difference<00:04:04.459> what<00:04:04.610> kind<00:04:04.640> of

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
makes a bit of a difference what kind of

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.819 
makes a bit of a difference what kind of
strategy<00:04:05.299> you<00:04:05.420> will<00:04:05.450> choose<00:04:05.780> so<00:04:06.049> i<00:04:06.260> would<00:04:06.650> say

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 
strategy you will choose so i would say

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:09.190 
strategy you will choose so i would say
that<00:04:06.880> everybody<00:04:07.880> is<00:04:08.269> going<00:04:08.450> into<00:04:08.780> in<00:04:09.049> those

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
that everybody is going into in those

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.590 
that everybody is going into in those
way<00:04:09.470> in<00:04:09.709> its<00:04:10.250> own<00:04:10.370> way<00:04:10.549> and<00:04:10.760> try<00:04:11.150> to<00:04:11.209> get<00:04:11.450> the

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
way in its own way and try to get the

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.750 
way in its own way and try to get the
maximum<00:04:11.989> out<00:04:12.470> of<00:04:12.530> it<00:04:12.739> what<00:04:13.549> do<00:04:13.640> you<00:04:13.670> think

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
maximum out of it what do you think

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.550 
maximum out of it what do you think
their<00:04:14.090> show<00:04:14.299> runs<00:04:14.570> like<00:04:14.840> that<00:04:14.870> we<00:04:15.260> have<00:04:15.410> it

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
their show runs like that we have it

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.409 
their show runs like that we have it
here<00:04:15.590> in<00:04:15.829> sochi<00:04:16.190> is<00:04:16.669> it<00:04:16.789> really<00:04:17.030> helped<00:04:17.299> to

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
here in sochi is it really helped to

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.360 
here in sochi is it really helped to
promote<00:04:17.690> the<00:04:18.109> former<00:04:18.500> one<00:04:18.769> it<00:04:18.919> definitely

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
promote the former one it definitely

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.550 
promote the former one it definitely
definitely<00:04:20.090> helps<00:04:20.780> a<00:04:20.870> lot<00:04:20.989> to<00:04:21.140> promote

because then they will have the race
they<00:04:24.140> will<00:04:24.289> know<00:04:24.470> already<00:04:24.740> what<00:04:25.039> formula<00:04:25.370> One

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
they will know already what formula One

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.390 
they will know already what formula One
is<00:04:25.640> and<00:04:26.210> they<00:04:26.930> will<00:04:27.080> the<00:04:27.560> city<00:04:27.830> you<00:04:28.070> know<00:04:28.100> it's

is and they will the city you know it's
important<00:04:28.820> to<00:04:28.910> get<00:04:29.030> the<00:04:29.120> city<00:04:29.330> behind<00:04:29.570> Formula

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
important to get the city behind Formula

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.130 
important to get the city behind Formula
One<00:04:30.580> also<00:04:31.580> it's<00:04:32.270> important<00:04:32.720> to<00:04:32.810> have<00:04:32.870> a<00:04:32.960> good

show it's important that people likes it
like<00:04:35.390> that<00:04:35.600> then<00:04:35.660> when<00:04:36.080> the<00:04:36.229> f1<00:04:36.530> will<00:04:36.710> come<00:04:36.919> it

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
like that then when the f1 will come it

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.700 
like that then when the f1 will come it
would<00:04:37.190> be<00:04:37.340> a<00:04:37.370> big<00:04:37.520> success
