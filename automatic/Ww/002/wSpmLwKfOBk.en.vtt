which is just a bit over 2 pound but

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.639 
which is just a bit over 2 pound but
what's<00:00:47.670> really<00:00:48.030> interesting<00:00:48.210> about<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:49.110> g1

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649

is<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.670> it's<00:00:50.820> actually<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.239> first

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
is that it's actually the first

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.600 
is that it's actually the first
ruggedized<00:00:52.289> tablet<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.949> come<00:00:53.129> out<00:00:53.309> with<00:00:53.460> this

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610

little sticker on it it's a Windows 8
pro<00:00:56.280> sticker<00:00:56.670> so<00:00:56.789> this<00:00:56.969> actually<00:00:57.270> ships<00:00:57.570> with

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640

particularly<00:01:07.799> impressed<00:01:08.189> with<00:01:08.549> Panasonic's

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
particularly impressed with Panasonic's

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.660 
particularly impressed with Panasonic's
effort<00:01:09.570> at<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.260> Toughbook<00:01:10.740> range<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.220> tablets

the<00:01:11.880> h1<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.600> h2<00:01:12.780> in<00:01:13.140> particular<00:01:13.470> we<00:01:14.130> felt<00:01:14.400> with

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
the h1 and h2 in particular we felt with

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.640 
the h1 and h2 in particular we felt with
pretty<00:01:14.670> lackluster<00:01:14.909> for<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.509> few<00:01:15.689> reasons<00:01:15.900> the

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
pretty lackluster for a few reasons the

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.590 
pretty lackluster for a few reasons the
first<00:01:16.830> one<00:01:16.979> being<00:01:17.280> screen<00:01:17.670> viewing<00:01:18.090> angle<00:01:18.450> so

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
first one being screen viewing angle so

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.300 
first one being screen viewing angle so

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.200 
that you can read it quite comfortably
outside<00:01:41.040> it's<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.400> little<00:01:41.640> bit<00:01:41.729> hard<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:41.970> show

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
outside it's a little bit hard to show

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.940 
outside it's a little bit hard to show
that<00:01:42.360> up<00:01:42.479> on<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.720> video<00:01:42.869> but<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:43.619> should<00:01:43.770> get

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
that up on the video but you should get

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.219 
that up on the video but you should get
the<00:01:44.070> idea<00:01:44.220> another<00:01:45.210> beautiful<00:01:45.689> thing<00:01:45.869> about

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
the idea another beautiful thing about

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.490 
the idea another beautiful thing about
the<00:01:46.409> display<00:01:46.770> on<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.920> g1<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:48.240> it's<00:01:48.360> a

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
the display on the g1 is that it's a

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.219 
the display on the g1 is that it's a
1600<00:01:49.500> by<00:01:50.070> 1200<00:01:50.579> resolution<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.780> it's<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:51.990> very

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
1600 by 1200 resolution so it's a very

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.050 
1600 by 1200 resolution so it's a very
high<00:01:52.500> resolution<00:01:52.770> display<00:01:53.579> for<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.850> little

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
high resolution display for a little

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.880 
high resolution display for a little
10-inch<00:01:54.420> tablet<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.079> it's<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.560> little<00:01:55.799> bit

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
10-inch tablet and it's a little bit

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.679 
10-inch tablet and it's a little bit
wider<00:01:56.100> so<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.729> can<00:01:56.880> be<00:01:57.000> used<00:01:57.180> comfortably

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
wider so that it can be used comfortably

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.200 
wider so that it can be used comfortably
in<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.960> portrait<00:01:58.290> view<00:01:58.619> yeah<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.520> g1<00:01:59.939> has<00:02:00.180> a

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
in the portrait view yeah the g1 has a

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.539 
in the portrait view yeah the g1 has a
little<00:02:00.509> port<00:02:00.840> cover<00:02:01.110> up<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.380> top<00:02:01.590> here<00:02:01.829> where

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
little port cover up the top here where

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.459 
little port cover up the top here where
you<00:02:02.670> can<00:02:02.850> see<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.329> can<00:02:03.780> get<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.049> sunlight<00:02:04.259> on

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
you can see I can get the sunlight on

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.160 
you can see I can get the sunlight on
that<00:02:04.740> we've<00:02:04.890> got<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.070> USB<00:02:05.369> port<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.509> also<00:02:06.840> HDMI

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
that we've got a USB port and also HDMI

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.309 
that we've got a USB port and also HDMI
port<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.039> an<00:02:08.429> audio<00:02:08.819> in<00:02:09.450> an<00:02:09.629> out<00:02:09.780> port<00:02:10.080> there

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
port and an audio in an out port there

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.260 
port and an audio in an out port there
so<00:02:10.590> we've<00:02:11.069> got<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.250> fair<00:02:11.459> bit<00:02:11.610> of<00:02:11.670> expansion

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
so we've got a fair bit of expansion

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.180 
so we've got a fair bit of expansion
here<00:02:12.420> it<00:02:12.780> is<00:02:12.930> a<00:02:12.959> USB<00:02:13.500> 3<00:02:13.770> port

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
here it is a USB 3 port

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.120 
here it is a USB 3 port
there<00:02:14.550> so<00:02:14.730> that's<00:02:14.880> a<00:02:15.030> nice<00:02:15.780> feature<00:02:16.130> also

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
there so that's a nice feature also

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.220 
there so that's a nice feature also
having<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.490> full<00:02:17.730> size<00:02:17.940> HDMI<00:02:18.240> if<00:02:18.720> you<00:02:18.810> ever<00:02:18.990> do

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
having the full size HDMI if you ever do

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.690 
having the full size HDMI if you ever do
need<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.500> connect<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:19.980> an<00:02:20.100> external<00:02:20.370> display

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
need to connect to an external display

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.250 
need to connect to an external display
or<00:02:21.240> a<00:02:21.270> projector<00:02:21.780> or<00:02:21.870> something<00:02:22.110> like<00:02:22.200> that

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
or a projector or something like that

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.830 
or a projector or something like that

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
having a full size HDMI is much better

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.180 
having a full size HDMI is much better
than<00:02:25.050> having<00:02:25.170> one<00:02:25.380> of<00:02:25.410> those<00:02:25.530> micro<00:02:26.010> sized

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
than having one of those micro sized

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.250 
than having one of those micro sized
HDMI<00:02:26.820> ports<00:02:27.180> will<00:02:27.300> always<00:02:27.600> fall<00:02:27.870> out<00:02:28.050> all<00:02:28.170> the

the<00:02:54.120> other<00:02:54.270> I<00:02:54.570> don't<00:02:54.960> think<00:02:55.290> that's<00:02:55.470> a<00:02:55.560> huge

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
the other I don't think that's a huge

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.770 
the other I don't think that's a huge
showstopper<00:02:56.220> but<00:02:57.180> it<00:02:57.270> is<00:02:57.390> something<00:02:57.600> to

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
showstopper but it is something to

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.780 
showstopper but it is something to
consider<00:02:57.960> we've<00:02:58.680> got<00:02:58.860> a<00:02:58.890> webcam<00:02:59.160> here<00:02:59.610> on<00:02:59.700> the

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
consider we've got a webcam here on the

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.490 
consider we've got a webcam here on the
front<00:03:00.030> and<00:03:00.180> we've<00:03:00.780> got<00:03:00.930> a<00:03:00.960> five<00:03:01.230> megapixel

camera on the back which we're fantastic
for<00:03:03.900> documentation<00:03:04.440> and<00:03:04.770> you<00:03:05.190> really<00:03:05.430> be<00:03:05.520> able

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
for documentation and you really be able

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.430 
for documentation and you really be able
to<00:03:05.760> take<00:03:05.970> advantage<00:03:06.390> of<00:03:06.420> that<00:03:06.630> in<00:03:06.810> Windows<00:03:07.050> 8

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
to take advantage of that in Windows 8

to take advantage of that in Windows 8
in<00:03:07.710> particular<00:03:08.070> now<00:03:08.880> the<00:03:08.940> battery<00:03:09.330> here<00:03:09.510> is

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
in particular now the battery here is

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.290 
in particular now the battery here is
removable<00:03:10.320> but<00:03:11.070> it's<00:03:11.250> not<00:03:11.400> hot<00:03:11.580> swappable<00:03:11.970> so

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
removable but it's not hot swappable so

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.400 
removable but it's not hot swappable so
that<00:03:12.450> means<00:03:12.630> you're<00:03:12.780> going<00:03:12.960> to<00:03:13.050> have<00:03:13.140> to<00:03:13.260> shut

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
that means you're going to have to shut

can only run on the Windows desktop that

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.070 
can only run on the Windows desktop that
said<00:05:05.260> of<00:05:05.380> course<00:05:05.560> this<00:05:06.520> being<00:05:06.729> Windows<00:05:07.120> 8<00:05:07.330> we

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
said of course this being Windows 8 we

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.960 
said of course this being Windows 8 we
have<00:05:08.260> access<00:05:08.650> to<00:05:08.919> all<00:05:09.220> of<00:05:09.280> the<00:05:09.550> metro-style

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.540 
have access to all of the metro-style
applications<00:05:10.960> that<00:05:11.139> you<00:05:11.260> get<00:05:11.500> in<00:05:11.949> Windows<00:05:12.370> 8

applications that you get in Windows 8

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.219 
applications that you get in Windows 8
so<00:05:12.910> we<00:05:13.060> do<00:05:13.210> have<00:05:13.389> things<00:05:13.720> like<00:05:13.930> a<00:05:13.960> touch

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:14.229 
so we do have things like a touch

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:15.779 
so we do have things like a touch
friendly<00:05:14.650> web<00:05:14.800> browser<00:05:15.070> here<00:05:15.340> that<00:05:15.490> you<00:05:15.580> can

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
access the one limitation that I found

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.689 
access the one limitation that I found
with<00:05:19.180> this<00:05:19.360> g1<00:05:19.960> is<00:05:20.199> the<00:05:20.800> fact<00:05:21.039> that<00:05:21.160> the<00:05:21.460> the

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:21.699 
with this g1 is the fact that the the

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:24.360 
with this g1 is the fact that the the
bezel<00:05:22.419> on<00:05:22.570> the<00:05:23.080> screen<00:05:23.380> goes<00:05:23.680> right<00:05:23.979> up<00:05:24.160> to<00:05:24.280> the

bezel on the screen goes right up to the

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.279 
bezel on the screen goes right up to the
edge<00:05:24.520> and<00:05:24.550> I'll<00:05:24.760> try<00:05:24.970> and<00:05:25.150> put<00:05:25.840> that<00:05:25.930> up<00:05:26.050> close

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:26.289 
edge and I'll try and put that up close

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:28.050 
edge and I'll try and put that up close
so<00:05:26.470> that<00:05:26.500> you<00:05:26.650> can<00:05:26.800> see<00:05:26.979> that<00:05:27.220> now<00:05:27.729> that's<00:05:27.910> a

so that you can see that now that's a

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.939 
so that you can see that now that's a
major<00:05:28.300> problem<00:05:28.630> in<00:05:28.900> Windows<00:05:29.260> 8<00:05:29.470> because<00:05:29.800> when

major problem in Windows 8 because when

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:31.409 
major problem in Windows 8 because when
it<00:05:30.039> comes<00:05:30.160> to<00:05:30.400> doing<00:05:30.520> things<00:05:30.760> like<00:05:30.910> swiping

GIS and asset management this is the

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.249 
GIS and asset management this is the
kind<00:07:07.180> of<00:07:07.240> tablet<00:07:07.600> that<00:07:07.690> you<00:07:07.780> probably<00:07:08.050> want<00:07:08.199> to

00:07:08.249 --> 00:07:08.259 
kind of tablet that you probably want to

00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:10.290 
kind of tablet that you probably want to
have<00:07:08.320> a<00:07:08.410> look<00:07:08.620> at<00:07:08.770> it<00:07:09.250> certainly<00:07:09.669> now<00:07:10.270> a

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:10.300 
have a look at it certainly now a

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.560 
have a look at it certainly now a
contender<00:07:11.050> to<00:07:11.199> the<00:07:11.229> motion<00:07:11.800> f5<00:07:12.330> series<00:07:13.330> which

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:13.570 
contender to the motion f5 series which

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.409 
contender to the motion f5 series which
has<00:07:13.810> been<00:07:14.050> by<00:07:14.349> far<00:07:14.380> the<00:07:15.310> dominant<00:07:15.520> tablet<00:07:16.300> in

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:16.419 
has been by far the dominant tablet in

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:18.510 
has been by far the dominant tablet in
this<00:07:16.539> category<00:07:16.870> and<00:07:17.139> Panasonic<00:07:18.070> have<00:07:18.130> finally

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:18.520 
this category and Panasonic have finally

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.249 
this category and Panasonic have finally
got<00:07:18.639> a<00:07:18.669> serious<00:07:19.030> competitor<00:07:19.750> to<00:07:19.870> that<00:07:20.020> product

00:07:20.249 --> 00:07:20.259 
got a serious competitor to that product

00:07:20.259 --> 00:07:21.930 
got a serious competitor to that product
so<00:07:20.620> we<00:07:20.770> expect<00:07:21.099> to<00:07:21.280> be<00:07:21.400> selling<00:07:21.699> a<00:07:21.759> lot<00:07:21.910> of

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:21.940 
so we expect to be selling a lot of

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.189 
so we expect to be selling a lot of
these<00:07:22.120> tablets<00:07:22.419> we'll<00:07:22.720> certainly<00:07:22.930> have<00:07:23.080> a

00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:23.199 
these tablets we'll certainly have a

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:24.600 
these tablets we'll certainly have a
demonstration<00:07:23.949> unit<00:07:24.190> for<00:07:24.310> you<00:07:24.370> to<00:07:24.460> have<00:07:24.580> a

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:24.610 
demonstration unit for you to have a

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.539 
demonstration unit for you to have a
look<00:07:24.759> at<00:07:24.970> as<00:07:25.210> well
