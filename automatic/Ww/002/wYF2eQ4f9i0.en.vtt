00:00:08.399 --> 00:00:11.399
 my name is gone 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:13.769
 for the region 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.730
 and parts baden-wÃ¼rttembergs responsible for the Forex revealed 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.210
 for the operational expansion 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.539
 AFP for talents 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:21.900
 for future leaders 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.900
 for our company 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:32.599
 Kon so we have been around 40 new attitude for centuries 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.190
 transacted throughout Germany 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.840
 because they are a growing company 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.690
 there are still some new offices this year, some new locations 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.010
 So both executives and financial advisers visit 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.480
 both people who already come on the market so have previous knowledge 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.280
 as well as 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.770
 Newcomers to the industry 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.600
 for the Isar all in all 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.210
 Between one hundred and three hundred people will be idylle executives 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.610
 So many talents 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:58.510
 we still like to 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.510
 Take up companies 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.190
 that's hard to say da Silva we have good experiences with 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.260
 career changers 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.370
 for example 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.840
 since Crisis science I would have made him or lawyers as well 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.920
 become one yourself 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.290
 but of course we are looking primarily 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.170
 Business Administration Economics graduates 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.890
 or any other interested party 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.820
 Your field of study right on people who do not feel like the desire 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.820
 To advise people 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.210
 As good as a consulting company, of course, we are looking for everything 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.370
 People who are equipped with a high degree of social competence 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:42.680
 Have empathy 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.290
 that deal well with people can be fun too 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.320
 to deal with people 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.690
 Per cent that are some of the most important soft skills so we 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.810
 of course, especially after the eternal search as in their previous lives 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.810
 whether professional or private or internships 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.620
 which 4 VR can bring that could be us everything at the SpoHo that can 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:01.710
 in politics 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.770
 but also 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.560
 Being at work all of these things are very much desired by us and certainly 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.560
 also helpful 

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:18.619
 for the financial crisis it always has its two sides there are certainly 

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:20.189
 many things that 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:23.919
 The Aldi will change a lot, among other things about our Porsche certainly 

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:24.739
 one 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.749
 is undergoing significant change 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:28.199
 we see that as positive 

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:30.649
 because the quality is getting more and more attention now 

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:34.289
 also have to be made transparent in the industry that means we had 

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:37.179
 yes believe that the industry will change positively 

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:39.879
 that's good for us, it's all about quality 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:43.559
 We clearly abstain from the principle that is high time for a German 

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:46.489
 Financial standard SPD still to develop this 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:47.639
 and from there 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:51.559
 I believe that the financial crisis is more helpful for our industry 1 

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:53.679
 dangerous in quotes 

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:57.179
 and I guess every graduate will be exactly that percent overseer 

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:02.029
 More babies on the job market certainly spend more times other than him 

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:03.479
 as arrive 

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:04.300
 So until 10 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.790
 since then a bit critical look should have which industry 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:07.669
 future 

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:10.599
 which profession does Europe's future look like? 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:12.510
 So sammer so the classic job Foppa 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.409
 one pulls heavy but those who look exactly where see fit and which 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:16.339
 Which 

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:19.759
 which researchers are involved and how, for example, the tax authorities 

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:21.499
 Toni undoubtedly has a future 

00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:23.789
 they are not really happy 

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:26.789
 as for him he has more advantages than disadvantages 

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:35.829
 yes I have a question that is so Bissinger make the colleagues 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.989
 some funny even funny about me this is my good fairy question as 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.580
 I dare to basically everyone with whom I sit together 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.399
 pretty much at the beginning of the conversation if he had the free choice today 

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:49.060
 3 have three wishes as free as the fairy godmother 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.780
 what things he does in his professional life of human dignity in his life 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:53.899
 professional activity 

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:56.969
 and depending on what few answers then 

00:03:56.969 --> 00:03:58.369
 I can recognize you well 

00:03:58.369 --> 00:04:01.139
 whether this can in principle fit for an advisory 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:02.469
 Village Association Sales Stop 

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:03.219
 the BA 

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:06.319
 yes, we are looking for people who are in the mood for sales 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:07.179
 buy advice 

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:10.119
 and I can read that good and then comes on everyone just like them 

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:12.399
 also a little smile 

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:15.039
 before I have any standard answers 

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:18.039
 Find standard questions 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:26.240
 I think both-and-of course that now the box 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.410
 normal answer to this question but I would say with us in ours 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.409
 Activity of this city is related to people 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:33.490
 tends to be one 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.960
 a high level of social competence 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.289
 you more important 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:39.610
 Of course, that should be a good education 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.379
 But I believe that sometimes time competent right experience 

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:44.610
 Benson guy is 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:45.750
 People profits is 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.650
 That's higher than pure grades 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.840
 since we were there no research that no scientific professions 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.620
 exercise 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.440
 then one in which it is also about bringing things over things 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.999
 to bring people closer to complexity 

00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:59.130
 easy to explain 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.720
 and that's why it's a little bit more important 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.720
 social skills 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:14.380
 I can remember that 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.380
 Always said that when you see me in the chair in five years 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:21.559
 When the Chelsea is active Pfeiffer "I have stopped 

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:24.139
 he was always good or good 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:27.139
 that was the best thing I've heard so far 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.529
 So that's what the ceiling was the blessed one 

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:41.029
 asked these memorized answers and it was sometime in the 

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:44.469
 or what do you have for life goals I am the one who immediately notices if someone 

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:47.739
 Son's decal is so if anyone is authentic or memorized 

00:05:47.739 --> 00:05:47.980
 Has 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.810
 Perfectly, then quickly re-old bad person fast too 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.669
 but there were already many 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:56.089
 People like Dirk Lottner know that they are synonymous, of course 

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:58.999
 He always tries to make it clear to him that I have to try 

00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:00.199
 get to know 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:02.389
 and not around Rome and when I'm about genetic testing 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:03.639
 that neither 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:04.840
 have or just what 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.059
 even on hard facts are important that is clear 

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:10.120
 Now it's about getting to know that should be easy 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.540
 and he himself because then you only see the job fit
