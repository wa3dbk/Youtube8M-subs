00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 good afternoon friends, this is probably mine 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.069
 the most crooked video and from sitting on the balcony 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.349
 did practice remembered one miraculous 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.259
 a thing that I really want 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.450
 share with you 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:17.820
 the quality is home but look up 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.119
 the end because i 'm sure she will bring 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:28.289
 you take the favor of many loved by two 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:30.599
 toothpicks and we continue to work with 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:35.100
 using toothpicks with our own 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:37.800
 eyes gently in the eyes straight poke 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.550
 no need to work yourself out at the beginning 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:45.180
 soft eyebrows need infusion 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:50.700
 with a sense of moderate pain go 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:52.620
 here is the third eye area on the edges 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.309
 fix a few seconds in each of 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.489
 points further when you got to the temples 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.780
 again from the inner corner of the eye you go 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:09.299
 on the bottom edge of the orbit 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:12.860
 to the outside after this you work 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:17.159
 back of the head 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:19.400
 stabbing straight through a whole series of tingling 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.400
 back of the head 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:29.660
 and then to you from 2 toothpicks 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.030
 only one is needed because with her 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.630
 help you will stimulate 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:40.180
 special points on the fingertips 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:49.670
 associated with eyes on one arm and 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:52.670
 then on the second hand give yourself 10 15 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.230
 seconds to reevaluate 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.550
 reload your visual analyzer 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:59.979
 and then look at that subject 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.200
 saw unclear 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.540
 You can immediately evaluate the effect of which 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.330
 is obtained from this practice in 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:12.830
 comments under the video write what you 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:15.760
 felt how the sight changed and 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.760
 meetings in the next video
