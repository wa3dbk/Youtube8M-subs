ooh very topic how to do it yeah this is

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.950 
ooh very topic how to do it yeah this is
one<00:01:44.789> of<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.970> things<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.270> gamer<00:01:45.479> be<00:01:45.659> he's<00:01:45.929> a

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
one of the things that gamer be he's a

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.130 
one of the things that gamer be he's a
high-risk<00:01:46.530> character<00:01:47.100> very<00:01:47.429> early<00:01:47.880> on

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
high-risk character very early on

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.309 
high-risk character very early on
high-risk<00:01:49.140> player<00:01:50.990> you<00:01:51.990> see<00:01:52.200> him

00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:52.319 
high-risk player you see him

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:54.499 
high-risk player you see him
uppercutting<00:01:53.009> against<00:01:53.819> knuckle<00:01:54.090> do<00:01:54.210> when<00:01:54.420> he

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
uppercutting against knuckle do when he

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.790 
uppercutting against knuckle do when he
didn't<00:01:54.659> even<00:01:54.750> have<00:01:54.929> meter<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.409> think<00:01:55.679> you

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
didn't even have meter that I think you

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:02.710 
didn't even have meter that I think you
see<00:01:56.039> it<00:01:56.479> he's<00:01:57.479> going<00:01:57.720> for<00:01:58.110> it

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.010 

again<00:02:03.700> that<00:02:04.700> range<00:02:05.000> is<00:02:05.240> just<00:02:05.360> where<00:02:05.660> a<00:02:05.810> Don's

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
again that range is just where a Don's

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.660 
again that range is just where a Don's
been<00:02:06.170> hanging<00:02:06.410> I<00:02:06.470> see<00:02:06.680> the<00:02:06.800> jump<00:02:07.100> on<00:02:07.340> reaction

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
been hanging I see the jump on reaction

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:15.100 
been hanging I see the jump on reaction
to<00:02:07.940> the<00:02:08.030> sonic<00:02:08.360> booms<00:02:13.720> that's<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.870> solution

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
to the sonic booms that's the solution

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.070 
to the sonic booms that's the solution
to<00:02:15.320> the<00:02:15.440> focus<00:02:15.770> you<00:02:16.400> can<00:02:16.430> focus<00:02:16.820> the<00:02:17.750> air

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080
