thinking<00:03:08.280> a<00:03:08.340> little<00:03:08.430> bit<00:03:08.549> more<00:03:08.760> about<00:03:08.970> it

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:09.409 
thinking a little bit more about it

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:11.629 
thinking a little bit more about it
let's<00:03:10.409> look<00:03:10.500> at<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.650> bottom<00:03:10.859> again<00:03:10.920> both<00:03:11.519> of

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:11.639 
let's look at the bottom again both of

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:14.599 
let's look at the bottom again both of
them<00:03:11.819> have<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.150> 20th<00:03:12.480> Century<00:03:12.780> Fox<00:03:12.810> logo<00:03:13.799> on

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.270 
them both have the kurt adler logo on
them<00:03:17.579> but<00:03:18.569> i<00:03:18.629> think<00:03:18.930> this<00:03:19.079> is<00:03:19.260> not<00:03:19.410> a<00:03:19.440> 20th

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
them but i think this is not a 20th

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.830 
them but i think this is not a 20th
Century<00:03:20.549> Fox<00:03:20.579> ripoff<00:03:21.209> I<00:03:21.389> think<00:03:21.569> this<00:03:21.660> is<00:03:21.720> a

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
Century Fox ripoff I think this is a

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.680 
Century Fox ripoff I think this is a
kurt<00:03:22.139> adler<00:03:22.319> ripoff<00:03:23.040> I<00:03:23.250> think<00:03:23.940> that<00:03:24.150> some

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
kurt adler ripoff I think that some

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.900 
kurt adler ripoff I think that some
factory<00:03:25.019> in<00:03:25.079> China<00:03:25.349> got<00:03:26.069> this<00:03:26.220> design<00:03:26.609> and

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
factory in China got this design and

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.270 
factory in China got this design and
said<00:03:27.060> okay<00:03:27.299> make<00:03:27.629> this<00:03:27.930> cheaper<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:28.799> so

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
said okay make this cheaper and so

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.220 
said okay make this cheaper and so
that's<00:03:29.459> what<00:03:29.639> they<00:03:29.790> did<00:03:29.849> so<00:03:30.510> I<00:03:30.540> think<00:03:30.659> Fox<00:03:30.989> got

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
that's what they did so I think Fox got

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.659 
that's what they did so I think Fox got
paid<00:03:31.409> i<00:03:31.530> don't<00:03:31.709> think<00:03:31.829> kurt<00:03:31.980> adler<00:03:32.159> got<00:03:32.459> paid

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:32.669 
paid i don't think kurt adler got paid

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:34.129 
paid i don't think kurt adler got paid
for<00:03:32.849> this<00:03:32.940> one<00:03:33.120> but<00:03:33.599> i'm<00:03:33.690> going<00:03:33.780> to<00:03:33.840> sell<00:03:34.019> these
