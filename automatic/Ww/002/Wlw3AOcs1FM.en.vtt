00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 yes laurent hello we are happy 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.350
 to find you here in marcoussis on 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.049
 one of the training grounds of the 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.450
 fifteen from France with a coach 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:11.250
 blues relaxed tonight philippe 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.099
 saint-andré after this beautiful match and this 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.369
 beautiful victory against the English 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:19.140
 relaxed we will say especially happy 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.170
 first of course of the victory against 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.519
 against England even though the ten 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.730
 last minutes were difficult 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.880
 and then especially relieved after the announcement 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.910
 31 players even if it's still 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.250
 difficult when in the life of a group 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.290
 we must separate from five players because 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.719
 that it is obviously the news of the day 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.489
 you announced this morning to your players 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.680
 the five who leave the group we are going to 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.680
 remember you had shawky sébastien 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.989
 vahaamahina loann goujon rémi lamerat and 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.550
 French trin-ducts are choices that 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.559
 were hard to do that was 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.079
 painful moments spent moments 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.930
 always difficult in the life of a 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.390
 group especially here I wanted and I 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.760
 do them but thank them because 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.430
 their professionalism their 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.560
 investment their mindset have 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.130
 been exceptional during the 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.430
 seven weeks 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.770
 I think we can see that he 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.450
 group lives well but because that's it 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.509
 but clan was exceptional so that's 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.420
 true that this morning it was difficult 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.770
 it was like we used to say 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.990
 that rugby is a second family and 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.490
 it's as if at one point you are 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.780
 there you separate from your family is this 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.119
 only to a player like François trin-duc 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.579
 finally he never convinced you 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.310
 over the four years no it's not because 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.750
 that French made made a fact a 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.390
 quality match at twickenham after one 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.770
 runs on on a three year cycle 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.049
 and a half and four years later it's true 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.700
 than françois compared to frédéric 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.140
 michalak or remy tales it is the one who has 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.270
 had the least amount of play time under my 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.210
 has been wandering for three and a half years 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.200
 but the problem is that 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.390
 at one point we asked ourselves 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.060
 question also to leave with with three 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.579
 opening half but the real 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.130
 problematic is that I wanted and 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.710
 my staff also three scorers 3 scorer 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.330
 world class and so that's 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.370
 for that we made the choice of two 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.260
 parties with 3.2 minul and fabien you 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.129
 have played four cups of the world in 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.349
 as a player 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.580
 how important is such 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:21.060
 list is this the culmination 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.780
 also of four years for a player and 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.849
 for a coach 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.709
 I lived in 4 cups of 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.910
 world and there are two in which 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.500
 I was not planned at the beginning ie 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.840
 that I had been discarded precisely during 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.629
 from when the list fell while 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.190
 side players it's very hard it's 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:37.140
 a collapse because somewhere 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.819
 I should have had 124 in nothing 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.080
 according to his age it's over for me 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.879
 and coaching side since I was 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.670
 coach a few years 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.900
 so I think that there must be some 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.470
 choice and at the same time you have to 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.410
 to justify 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:53.190
 and in relation to philippe's choices 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:56.519
 somewhere a feeling that he was 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.200
 consistent with its mandate at this 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.150
 moment we ask ourselves the question is this 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.310
 that I do I do I take 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.390
 decisions on my mandate in relation to 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.280
 players who have been the most consistent 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.659
 or of course these last two months 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.319
 especially on the last two matches 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:09.180
 facing England 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.069
 I also make the choice of politics 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.690
 of man fit in our fees and a 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.459
 arbitration to be done at that level then 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.959
 exactly how you you 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.000
 process after what must be said 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.750
 is that about these five players who 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.790
 like they did all this 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.040
 preparation with us and there are a lot 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.569
 of hope because I made two cuts 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.400
 of the world with fabien 91 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:29.220
 we did all the preparation together 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.470
 but 95 fabien arrived just for 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.930
 the semifinals in south africa and 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.790
 plays the semi finals so we know that 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.650
 it's difficult for these five players 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.030
 but there are workouts there are 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.069
 another friendly match during the 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.620
 competition we can have wounded and 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.239
 it's true that these five players took 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.860
 of the advanced on the others because they 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.299
 know the rules of life they 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.220
 know the systems and then especially 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.000
 here they have been irreproachable in 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.190
 their state of mind 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.990
 so you've played two games 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.880
 against the English it will remain a match 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.560
 of preparation against Scotland you 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.270
 advance you have the feeling that the 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.760
 the team is growing 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.920
 of course we move forward we are where we 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.340
 wanted to be after seven weeks after 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.500
 we know that we have on this match there I 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.950
 believe we have mastered we managed well 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.980
 68 68 minutes after the 12 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.329
 last minutes were difficult and 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.880
 so here we have to progress there 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.650
 on it we did not know how to close thoughtfully 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.380
 we were too long we left too much time 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.810
 to the English we missed the tackles 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.000
 also at the end of the loan at the end of the second 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.740
 half time we did not manage to keep 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.890
 the balloon while we did it during 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.080
 68 70 minutes including ccd work axes 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.330
 what are we going to do to play the pods where 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.640
 it's still I believe in front of the cameras 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.169
 of France 2 so there are still places 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.100
 also at the Stade de France so come 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.440
 numerous 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.520
 early September bear the blues without 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.320
 necessarily speak the match reference 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.220
 fabien this yesterday's benefit of 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.440
 the France team has been 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.270
 particularly accomplished you 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.130
 convinced this team and a month on the 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.600
 philippe's warrant i place this thing 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.550
 is three best matches I you 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.830
 wish of australia in november 2012 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.760
 well I do not place it very far from this 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.640
 market in terms of performance 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.710
 collective I liked this team 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.360
 is on the brink of long days that 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.210
 hope that there has been a displacement 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.960
 both offensive and collective we have seen 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.220
 players who will know that they 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.660
 would come down again to revive the 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.550
 balloons we've seen players move 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.140
 supports very close who has who has 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.790
 prevented those who prevented the English 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.750
 to defend and scratch the balloons and 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.729
 then also defensively 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.919
 except the last fifteen minutes a team 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:27.240
 who closes and although they had a good 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.650
 timing to ride who was still 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.330
 to control when to control 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.410
 and especially grazing to 2 interesting 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.729
 where there was a charming plating a 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.410
 threshing up to prevent the 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:35.970
 transmission is behind our lines that 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.830
 they are received reconstitute very quickly 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.600
 for me it's one of the best magical 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.460
 de france you have gained confidence 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.860
 on this match me no in competition 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.630
 subscribes after three years and sells 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.100
 armored but I believe so for the 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.690
 group 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.480
 for the state of mind for trust 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:53.850
 to know that after after seven 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.490
 weeks of preparation we are able 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.530
 to compete with the English of the 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.300
 dominate for 70 minutes after one 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.950
 remains in a third phase of 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.150
 preparation that is going to be the most 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.430
 important where we will go on the 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.930
 details we will go on the fuye 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.570
 sharpening we will go on explosiveness 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.010
 he'll have to be a little more one 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:13.140
 will say the cellars are on our 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.730
 game launches but what is sure 

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.110
 is that the team progresses thank you 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:18.180
 a lot philippe saint-andré 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:21.830
 laurent the france team advances in 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.830
 the prospect the world cup
