 Hello, this experiment is an animated cartoon. 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:16.550
 You like your animations so much. 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:21.920
 Make use of 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:26.720
 We come in very fast and the scene changes and we can not change until 2 o'clock 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.890
 10 like profane scenes will recognize an animation using this effect 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.419
 I make it. 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:36.190
 Use a mirror if we have any such animated statues in any way 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:41.450
 It's easy to recognize. 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:45.610
 If you open the art , 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.610

 When I made the device, I could easily see the fingerprints on the glass surface. 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:41.069
 So the other places do not care at all 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:42.300
 Because where the image is illuminating in this town, you can ask intelligent, so mandeusineun 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:47.040
 I recommend 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:51.860
 And there will be one blank paper. 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.860
 Please make an animation and try it once
