looking right at the camera what the

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.590 
looking right at the camera what the
hell<00:05:43.000> that<00:05:43.540> was<00:05:44.910> well<00:05:45.910> that<00:05:46.030> was<00:05:46.150> not<00:05:46.330> a<00:05:46.390> very

hell that was well that was not a very
good<00:05:46.720> game<00:05:46.900> I<00:05:47.140> think<00:05:47.380> we<00:05:47.800> got<00:05:47.950> one<00:05:48.220> hit<00:05:48.430> in<00:05:48.610> the

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:48.700 
good game I think we got one hit in the

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.159 
good game I think we got one hit in the
gap<00:05:48.820> I<00:05:49.180> thought<00:05:49.510> it<00:05:49.600> was<00:05:49.690> at<00:05:49.870> least<00:05:49.990> I<00:05:50.050> thought

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:50.169 
gap I thought it was at least I thought

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:52.050 
gap I thought it was at least I thought
it<00:05:50.229> was<00:05:50.380> in<00:05:50.440> the<00:05:50.500> gap<00:05:50.650> and<00:05:51.040> I<00:05:51.430> tried<00:05:51.669> to<00:05:51.760> run<00:05:51.850> too

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
it was in the gap and I tried to run too

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.490 
it was in the gap and I tried to run too
and<00:05:52.300> it<00:05:52.360> turned<00:05:52.510> out<00:05:52.630> to<00:05:52.780> just<00:05:52.810> you<00:05:53.169> know<00:05:53.229> be<00:05:53.290> a

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
and it turned out to just you know be a

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.409 
and it turned out to just you know be a
single<00:05:53.830> so<00:05:54.040> that<00:05:54.220> wasn't<00:05:54.370> kind<00:05:55.360> of

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:55.419 
single so that wasn't kind of

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:57.450 
single so that wasn't kind of
anticlimactic<00:05:55.750> but<00:05:56.260> that's<00:05:56.410> okay

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
anticlimactic but that's okay

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.820 
anticlimactic but that's okay
