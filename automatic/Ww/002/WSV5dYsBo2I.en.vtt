 the three best in the country because of their 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.609
 two thousand 686 specimens of 486 species and 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.759
 that thanks to good weather and habitat 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.250
 during the year 2013 109 were registered 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.559

 Regarding reproduction of different 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:55.390
 species since we have a climate that does not 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:58.450
 it's so warm or so cold then it's a 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.220
 temperate climate that is very important already 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.410
 that you can give the reproduction of 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.570
 different species many of these 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.190
 newly bud species are found 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.770
 in the area known as zoo

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:28.869
 the animals that are not fed by 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.180
 the parents then we bring it in this 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.580
 area then it is given a careful 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.040

 protected by being in danger of 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.980
 extinction and maintains a natal control of 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.060
