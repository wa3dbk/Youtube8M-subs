 spectacular ceremony that lasted 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.460
 about three hours so very at 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.190

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.380
 see a parody of precisely the queen 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:16.860
 quite pretty father one of the 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.740
 most important moments of precisely 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.280
 the ceremony was where seven young people 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.470

 and finally when Maria del Rosario 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.750
 espinoza 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.750
 laura sanchez on dives 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.840
 what a wonder in archery are the 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.480
 three remaining good bronze medals 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.000
 in this delegation that went to london it 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.390
 establishes as the second best Mexican 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.660
 just below Mexico 68 where 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.910
 managed to get nine medals 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.280
 externally outside of Mexico is the 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.620
 first time that number is achieved 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.590
 of medals with thousand congratulations to all 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.830
 and each of them every medal is very 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.620
 significant for mexico but good since 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.470
 they will receive their financial reward and 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.990
 also of love from all the 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.250
 public of mexico now let's talk about 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.760
 the Olympic torch 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.880
 its design resembles a golden mesh and 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.340
 contains 8,000 holes that represent 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.320
 the number of carriers and the distance 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.350
 in miles of travel until the day of 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:05.200
 the elaboration its triangular shape has 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.319
 several meanings one of them the 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.469
 Olympic values 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:13.109
 but excellence and friendship and 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:16.200
 also the highest Olympic motto more 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:18.359
 fast stronger and good to me too 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.209
 The logo caught my attention 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:24.090
 who occupied this occasion or demonstrate the 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:27.359
 number 2012 and includes the rings 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.450
 olympics the word london your design 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:33.750
 it is modern also symbolizes the spirit 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.030
 Olympic and the translation of the games 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.790
 towards people to join 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.189
 new people not sports people 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.340
 with talent and so good and for the first 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:47.400
 Once this logo will be used to 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.519
 the paralympic games and their creator 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.069
 was a brand consultant we know 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:56.270
 to London's pets and according to 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:58.880
 as inspired stories 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.820
 while they build in the stadium for 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.670
 the olympic games saw some 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:08.210
 drops of steel and that's what the 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:11.060
 inspired to make this oral logo and 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:13.910
 well we could observe 26 sports 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.430
 Olympians that span more than 39 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:20.120
 disciplines and now let's know a little 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:23.360
 more of the way and how are the 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:26.300
 medals have circular shape and in the 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.069
 Adverse is shown to the goddess or what 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.979
 on the back a design is observed 

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:33.440
 complex whose background looks like the 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:35.120
 an amphitheater and in the center is shown 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.909
 the logo of the Olympic games ' 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.610
 in addition a grid that evokes the 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:43.490
 energy that the athletes radiate 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.990
 the Tamesi river and a square figure that 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.479
 It is in the center that draws much 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.879
 attention and the designer of the prized 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:52.099

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:54.979
