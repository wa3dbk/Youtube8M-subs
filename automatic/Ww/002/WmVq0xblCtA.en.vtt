00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 the breath from a moment the exchange mattar 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.759
 maybe marotta while very serious 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.290
 shit to avoid undue a couple of 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.200
 pour more frays and then the 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.710
 they are ruining two opponents, it is 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.460
 of corradini 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:19.369
 and only one lap was made evident 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:22.110
 pull out the tag when we are at 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.300
 thirty-seventh minus 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.400
 time and the juventus benefit of football 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.590
 of production and is certainly the first 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.640
 great opportunity for the bianconeri 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.070
 almost a ballistic position 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.140
 ideal for roberto baggio head comes 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.940
 from the right position on the 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.590
 center and counting we review the 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.770
 do this penetration attempt 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.170
 central that goes to break against the 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.600
 legs the ball had passed I would say that the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.950
 evaluation of obesity more than just 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.690
 I would say that it is a position even from de 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.820
 agostini the juventus of the rest as 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.960
 free kick certainly a lot 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.600
 alternatives even if the eyes do 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.190
 so the meetings of my friends in 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.780
 right now they don't seem to be doing 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.890
 despair very well not even from this 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.900
 case of proceeding we have seen 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.430
 an almost marble expression of 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.570
 gigi maifredi that public youtube 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.820
 we have set in this case of 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.290
 function we know the thirty-eighth e 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.210
 therefore reviewing the dynamics also 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.310
 of the foul intervention we understand that 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.960
 the admonition imposed for the area 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.520
 it derives only from the father who ferrara 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.510
 protested against the director 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.580
 of competition 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.550
 let's see how the 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:27.340
 barrier there are simon in barrier and the 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.720
 there are seven possibilities for baggio 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.840
 possibility for baggio to go to the shooting 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.940
 sharp jump in May attention goals slips 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.040
 the ballistic ball masterpiece of 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.710
 roberto maggio is a game that gives away 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.600
 Juventus is very spectacular 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.700
 purpose I had done but Roberto May 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.760
 gave this beautiful signatures 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.040
 when we reached the 39th minute but 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.080
 I would say that I blame you for more than Naples 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.260
 this he was very good and you see 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.110
 that clement galli does not see much and that 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.240
 passes right into the only possible hole 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.670
 if he is behind the ball 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.110
 Meanwhile, let's review this again 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.300
 beautiful this beautiful 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.000
 I would say the double framing nature 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.710
 what a great responsibility perhaps 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.509
 the great fear of the curators 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.860
 Juventus who did study something 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.860
 we still stop at the globes
