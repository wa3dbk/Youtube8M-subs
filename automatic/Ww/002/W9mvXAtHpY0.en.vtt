 I have nothing against people 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.530
 who are attracted to people 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.530

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.060

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.430

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.920
 saying 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:32.310

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.310
 dolphin dave you stay without a skull 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:41.420
 although marquez 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:45.230
 will give me to make a video 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.230
 with yuca bild 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.870
 good 18 casualties two of them have been 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:57.020
 bloodthirsty pair of distant shots 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.880
 working already we have done it 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:04.030

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:30.630
 well it's fine let's go up 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:32.880
 let's see if we're going to give us here 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:36.140
 in the case where some shot will be missing 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.140
 so we do not get rid of it 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:48.280
 which I do not think we have done without 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.280
 marker 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.560
 last killed to which I give and marquez 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.140
 that was my distant shot and down I had 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.740
 another to the right to right eye just to 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.740
 car 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.130
 and the guy killed 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.980
 It is not worth that I do I say I flip 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.540
 it could have been a triple the boy 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.910
 could have hit a triple without 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.110
 I would have liked good, there was only one 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.770
 low to finish the game of the other 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.110
 team 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:20.500
 they follow the triple variation to move me 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:22.180
 I have electronic resistance 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.309
 and that 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:27.349

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.320
