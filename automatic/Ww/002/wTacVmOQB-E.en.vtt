Android<00:03:44.939> 4.1<00:03:45.739> so<00:03:46.739> it's<00:03:47.220> not<00:03:47.459> the<00:03:47.700> newest

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090

between<00:05:12.990> this<00:05:13.409> and<00:05:13.710> like<00:05:13.830> an<00:05:13.979> S<00:05:14.159> 3<00:05:14.550> or<00:05:14.849> 4<00:05:15.440> I've

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
between this and like an S 3 or 4 I've

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.409 
between this and like an S 3 or 4 I've
never<00:05:16.740> had<00:05:16.949> one<00:05:17.099> of<00:05:17.220> those<00:05:17.310> phones<00:05:17.639> so<00:05:17.970> I<00:05:18.060> can't

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
never had one of those phones so I can't

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:23.080 
never had one of those phones so I can't
really<00:05:18.599> tell<00:05:19.590> you<00:05:20.150> the<00:05:21.150> difference<00:05:21.570> I<00:05:21.870> mean<00:05:22.229> I

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
really tell you the difference I mean I

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.339 
really tell you the difference I mean I
guess<00:05:24.090> if<00:05:24.270> you<00:05:24.389> go<00:05:24.570> from<00:05:24.779> a<00:05:24.960> phone<00:05:25.139> like<00:05:25.320> that

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:25.349 
guess if you go from a phone like that

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:26.270 
guess if you go from a phone like that
to<00:05:25.740> phone<00:05:25.950> like

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280
