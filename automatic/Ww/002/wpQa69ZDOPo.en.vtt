00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.500
 today we are going to talk about what to project what 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:14.599
 which is a new car simulator that 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.250
 they were developing for a good time and 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.349
 that finally sees the light thanks to bandai 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.970
 namco but knowing that already in the market 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:21.800
 there are games like money for speed forza 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.239
 motorsport or a great tourism 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.509
 really now in grief that what 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:25.509
 buy 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.700
 boot game blocks you all the 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.800
 catalog of cars and tracks so that 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.570
 you can try there is a variant of 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.309
 cars that go from chachi karts to 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.980
 cars in prototype brands that maybe 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.780
 have never heard of project cars 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.580
 there are no unlockable money and no 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.620
 there are special powers to rewind the 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.540
 time is still wrong so your 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.220
 only incentive is to beat the time of 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.320
 your opponents or win races 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.879
 specific but for that you're going to 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.710
 need a lot of patience and skill 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.390
 to be able to be like a car as if 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.760
 you were really on the track and not 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.440
 wrong the initial controls 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.090
 are so attached to the reality that 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.710
 can discourage people who just 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.960
 they wanted a racing game that is 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.100
 easy to understand by red cars requires that 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.869
 invest enough time of 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.030
 familiarize yourself with all the settings of 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.680
 each vehicle in the long run can be very 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.990
 satisfying to win a race but 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.240
 as I mentioned that requires more work 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.830
 of what one would expect giblets 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.149
 allows to modify practically all 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.649
 the vehicles from the axis of 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.470
 transmission the duration of the tires 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:24.690
 aerodynamics or even strategy in 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.310
 pits to refuel in addition 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.869
 are the settings of each track that you 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.880
 allow to modify the climate and 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.409
 number of vehicles on track that up 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.520
 now surpasses any other simulator 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.500
 From the market 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.750
 sometimes it is overwhelming how much 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.679
 options that you have to take into account 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.479
 happily the interface is explained from 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:41.700
 clearly what its effects would be in 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.200
 the track the topic that you are going to delay a 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.210
 good time in finding the settings 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.350
 perfect to translate it from management and I 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.759
 would have liked to be able to modify the 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.289
 details inside the race instead 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.579
 go out to menus and reload 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.579
 the games over and over again 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.600
 Now that's a good training for 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.299
 the multiplayer mode that is the true 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.920
 challenge of the whole game where you compete with 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.270
 real times of real people who 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.270
 they are playing in simultaneous with you 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.840
 now if you want you can use a 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.729
 keyboard but my recommendation is that it 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.220
 get control both Xbox or 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.350
 play station because the vibration in the 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.440
 control is very good feel for pedal 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.680
 and the braking of each crash and between 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.680
 engines 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.050
 the online mode usually works 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.490
 pretty good although at certain times of 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.110
 day is hard to find others 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.270
 users that are available for 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.650
 compete with you is also the mode 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.120
 campaign that puts you a series 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.430
 goals that make you explore each 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.810
 vehicle category the graphics are 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.850
 they look pretty good in the models of 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.230
 cars are full of details the 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.700
 shock effects still have things that 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.590
 improve especially because the vehicles 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.970
 they still feel like solid blocks of 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.770
 steel that only comes off 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.510
 certain parts what yes there is that 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.910
 highlight are the effects of climate like 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.200
 the rain and the fog that you see 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.700
 spectacular at the end I get a 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.830
 impression that the game is missing something 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.240
 of spirit apparently the intention of 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.250
 the developers was to create a good 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.900
 racing simulator and point which 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.360
 I think they have managed to get quite 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.890
 well and in that sense the value of this 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.209
 game will depend a lot on how 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.060
 You are a fan of racing 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.740
 public professionals is a title 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.840
 interesting but it's not for everyone 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.910
 stressed that this is more a simulator of 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.620
 careers than a video game whereby 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.620
 it may end up being quite technical 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.810
 happily you are allowed to customize the 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.490
 experience to make it more accessible to 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.990
 all without neglecting the super 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.520
 fanatics who care about each 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.640
 small detail to win the 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.640
 career
