over there something electricity turning

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.740 
over there something electricity turning
of<00:04:54.020> the<00:04:54.200> ecosystem<00:04:55.000> under<00:04:56.000> the<00:04:56.150> curse<00:04:56.330> a<00:04:56.480> given

of the ecosystem under the curse a given
empowerment

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.410 

now<00:05:35.750> time<00:05:35.990> for<00:05:36.020> the<00:05:36.200> conclusion<00:05:36.970> as<00:05:37.970> I<00:05:38.240> said

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:38.420 
now time for the conclusion as I said

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.270 
now time for the conclusion as I said
before<00:05:38.570> the<00:05:38.840> seed<00:05:39.020> was<00:05:39.230> very<00:05:39.470> very<00:05:39.650> good<00:05:39.800> great

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 
before the seed was very very good great

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.740 
before the seed was very very good great
legroom<00:05:40.700> much<00:05:40.940> more<00:05:41.180> than<00:05:41.330> what<00:05:41.510> would<00:05:41.660> you

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
legroom much more than what would you

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.590 
legroom much more than what would you
expect<00:05:41.960> from<00:05:42.290> LCC<00:05:43.100> I<00:05:43.280> had<00:05:43.790> no<00:05:43.970> complaints<00:05:44.480> at

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.600 
expect from LCC I had no complaints at

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.340 
expect from LCC I had no complaints at
all<00:05:44.630> therefore<00:05:44.990> I'll<00:05:45.260> give<00:05:45.440> that<00:05:45.470> an<00:05:45.830> energon

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:47.350 
all therefore I'll give that an energon

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.230 
all therefore I'll give that an energon
now<00:05:48.350> the<00:05:48.410> crew<00:05:48.740> they<00:05:49.580> didn't<00:05:49.820> really<00:05:49.940> make<00:05:50.120> an

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
now the crew they didn't really make an

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.820 
now the crew they didn't really make an
appearance<00:05:50.510> throughout<00:05:50.900> the<00:05:51.050> flight<00:05:51.230> and<00:05:51.530> I

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
appearance throughout the flight and I

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.020 
appearance throughout the flight and I
didn't<00:05:52.010> really<00:05:52.100> get<00:05:52.310> a<00:05:52.370> greeting<00:05:52.820> either

didn't really get a greeting either

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.460 
didn't really get a greeting either
therefore<00:05:53.660> it's<00:05:54.350> my<00:05:54.560> opinion<00:05:54.830> better<00:05:55.160> three<00:05:55.370> I

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
therefore it's my opinion better three I

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.660 
therefore it's my opinion better three I
paid<00:05:57.470> around<00:05:57.590> two<00:05:57.860> thousand<00:05:58.160> rupees<00:05:58.250> for<00:05:58.580> this

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:58.670 
paid around two thousand rupees for this

paid around two thousand rupees for this
ticket<00:05:59.000> which<00:05:59.120> is<00:05:59.270> around<00:05:59.570> double<00:05:59.960> of<00:06:00.080> what<00:06:00.260> I

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380
