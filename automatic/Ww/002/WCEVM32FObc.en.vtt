 At the foot 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:48.820
 It is a Japanese pedal that there is no mountain Japan is easy to make sound and it is thought that there are three as well 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.949
 I think it was 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.699
 I think so too much because I use the third pedal in the middle and there are few 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:01:01.820
 I will 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:01:05.880
 It has been year-old, and it is number 25 but it is already the best in the sense of rareness 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:08.970

 Yes was the best is a little thin-year-old Toka I quiet this is also great as the other lively 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:43.100
 I think it will be better then, but it is this glittering thing, but always with this sound 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.060
