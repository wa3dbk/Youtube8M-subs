00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.310
 Hello, how are you all? 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.230
 Welcome and welcome to this new 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.059
 video review in this opportunity I'm going 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.010
 to talk about four products the 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:11.750
 Korean people and those you can find in 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.250
 the Chilean market I have many 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.990
 Korean products of which you could 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.850
 talking to them could be a video but 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.289
 only of Korean things but I think 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.789
 that the sea a little bit I want to intersperse 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.410
 with things that you can also find 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.180
 everyone is anywhere without 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.070
 abandon of course my purchases by 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.230
 Internet that I like so much if they want 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.359
 buy something that I have and do not know if 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.830
 buy it do not know if it works please 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.590
 tell me I can give you my opinion 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.969
 happy of life in our life so 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.649
 I'm going to start with a product that 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:39.260
 found in stores but it is not 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.809
 with another part is the america promote the 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.700
 yerba English pardon almost all 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.530
 dominant eyes cause allergies 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.480
 I can no longer use the other gene's 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.160
 the idea not even from l'oréal I bought it 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.829
 because I was missing makeup remover from 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.600
 eyes and it was super cheap if not good 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.399
 I think it's the best make-up remover in the 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.140
 I think the world is super good especially 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.910
 considering the price I leave it in the 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.440
 cotton and pressing a while and 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.359
 there I'm taking out the makeup you have to 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.280
 debating it a little bit is not solid just says 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:05.820
 not having silicones is super good and 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.040
 So far it has not produced 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.010
 Allergies as I say is cheap various 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.540
 two thousand 490 approximately is good as well 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.820
 that if they find it out there do not hesitate 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.850
 try it the next product is from the 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.619
 brand 100 10 10 is called pizza that by 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.630
 this one will be more ideal for the skins 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.940
 mixed like mine we have pores 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.619
 very marked leaves the skin very smooth is 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.060
 that cites the need brings me what 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.650
 you explain after the tonic and before 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.880
 the moisturizer every day and you go 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.770
 to notice that the makeup looks 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.900
 even better has a little effect 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.130
 similar to the perfections of this loader 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.990
 but of course they are not the same 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.720
 ingredients the exact same 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.820
 texture texture texture 10,000 times 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.920
 cheap the container is not much in the 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.780
 nice glass but in doser I do not know 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.520
 If you can see it there, it looks 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.039
 Suddenly work remains if you have to 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.780
 remove it you have to disassemble the container 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:54.180
 dry a little around the product is 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.700
 half boom better that does not kill me but 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.200
 the product itself is amazing of that I 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.759
 I use it every day I do not know if what 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.530
 they noticed that this product is missing and has 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.210
 pretty busy and I already ordered a 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.369
 new for when I run out because it 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.170
 transformed the essentials of my routine very 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.929
 well there with example is a great brand 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.519
 of products co 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.950
 The third product is the treatment 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:14.780
 instant the bid that I make mq of 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.730
 l'oréal this product was given to me by the 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.200
 real thank you thank you thank you and although I 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.000
 I have very wavy hair I was 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.840
 using for after drying 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.489
 analyze it how to rinse shampoo 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.129
 rinse conditioner treatment a 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.900
 in blocks and ready I do not know if they are 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.670
 many silicones or who would not know 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.469
 say it, do not be an expert on ingredients 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.209
 of the shampoo and conditioner is but 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:37.329
 indeed it is but there is much more 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.189
 docile the tips feel much better 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:42.439
 finished already much longer and a bird 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:44.599
 big defects 200 of the heaviest what 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:46.849
 I find an excellent product very well 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.290
 l'oréal so the little girls that 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.120
 want to perform hair only with 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.280
 plant and this kind of thing or they have 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.200
 the natural straight hair this product them 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.189
 it will work amazing and finally 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.709
 I'm going to talk about another product 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:59.840
 korean this tincture perez inc of the brand 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.870
 but let's say but but but 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.909
 but but but but but but but 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.680
 I'm occupying this time in this 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:08.150
 I bought it when they were when 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.859
 then of the increase see 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.540
 details if I have not finished much more 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:13.730
 bright and somewhat sticky so there's no 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.830
 a cap there you can see the sponge 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.870
 It is super easy application and the best 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.790
 is that it has a very good hard application 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.230
 a lot even costs a bit to get it out 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.700
 I think that's the big flaw but the 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.260
 truth is very good for people 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.420
 that we love make up I do not think we're 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.250
 run a lot of lipsticks is far one 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.750

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.480
