00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
this is my virtual pinball machine that

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.320 
this is my virtual pinball machine that
I've<00:00:04.560> been<00:00:04.710> working<00:00:04.920> on<00:00:05.330> still

want it so I'm just gonna enjoy it for a
little<00:00:16.049> while<00:00:16.320> before<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:16.770> get<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.220> time<00:00:17.430> to

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
little while before I get the time to

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.279 
little while before I get the time to
tear<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:17.850> all<00:00:17.940> down<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.240> start<00:00:18.750> over<00:00:18.930> again

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:21.289 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.140 

now<00:00:22.289> setup<00:00:22.710> like<00:00:23.010> this<00:00:23.250> allows<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:23.910> have<00:00:24.000> a

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
now setup like this allows you to have a

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.900 
now setup like this allows you to have a
whole<00:00:24.359> collection<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.990> pinball<00:00:25.230> machines<00:00:25.910> in

doesn't take up a whole lot of space and

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.940 
doesn't take up a whole lot of space and
because<00:00:32.189> there<00:00:32.910> are<00:00:32.940> exact<00:00:33.570> copies<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:34.500> the

because there are exact copies of the
actual<00:00:35.399> games<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.180> they<00:00:36.750> have<00:00:36.960> real<00:00:37.649> arcade

it<00:00:39.780> feels<00:00:40.290> surprisingly<00:00:40.530> like<00:00:41.309> playing<00:00:41.579> a

it feels surprisingly like playing a
real<00:00:41.879> machine<00:00:42.059> it's<00:00:42.510> just<00:00:42.809> smaller<00:00:45.500> now<00:00:46.500> the

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590

machines<00:01:37.130> it<00:01:38.090> never<00:01:38.570> really<00:01:39.050> worked<00:01:39.260> too<00:01:39.500> good

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
machines it never really worked too good

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.460 
machines it never really worked too good
on<00:01:39.830> my<00:01:40.040> system<00:01:40.580> so<00:01:40.820> I<00:01:41.540> got<00:01:41.930> rid<00:01:42.080> of<00:01:42.140> it<00:01:42.350> I

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
on my system so I got rid of it I

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.350 
on my system so I got rid of it I
replaced<00:01:42.830> it<00:01:43.010> with<00:01:43.040> pinball<00:01:43.610> axe<00:01:43.880> which<00:01:44.180> is

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
replaced it with pinball axe which is

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.170 
replaced it with pinball axe which is
pretty<00:01:45.259> new<00:01:45.530> it<00:01:45.710> was<00:01:45.830> just<00:01:46.070> started<00:01:46.460> in<00:01:46.610> May<00:01:46.880> of

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
pretty new it was just started in May of

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.859 
pretty new it was just started in May of
this<00:01:47.330> year

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
this year

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.560 
this year
and<00:01:47.960> it<00:01:48.950> has<00:01:49.130> been<00:01:49.310> working<00:01:49.520> great<00:01:49.970> that's

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
and it has been working great that's

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.900 
and it has been working great that's
very<00:01:50.690> easy<00:01:51.110> to<00:01:51.229> setup<00:01:51.619> very<00:01:52.369> easy<00:01:52.550> to<00:01:52.759> pick

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
very easy to setup very easy to pick

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.930 
very easy to setup very easy to pick
tables<00:01:53.180> and<00:01:53.660> I've<00:01:54.530> been<00:01:54.740> very<00:01:54.890> happy<00:01:54.979> with<00:01:55.430> it

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.980 

okay<00:01:58.940> here's<00:01:59.240> how<00:01:59.420> it<00:01:59.539> works

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
okay here's how it works

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.680 
okay here's how it works
now<00:02:00.590> pinball<00:02:01.070> X<00:02:01.310> gives<00:02:01.970> you<00:02:02.090> this<00:02:02.180> display

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
now pinball X gives you this display

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.600 
now pinball X gives you this display
mode<00:02:02.960> showing<00:02:03.470> the<00:02:03.560> back<00:02:03.740> glass<00:02:04.009> there<00:02:04.369> in<00:02:04.520> the

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
mode showing the back glass there in the

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.139 
mode showing the back glass there in the
play<00:02:04.820> field<00:02:05.060> and<00:02:06.280> you<00:02:07.280> can<00:02:07.399> use<00:02:07.610> the<00:02:07.789> flipper

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
play field and you can use the flipper

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.990 
play field and you can use the flipper
buttons<00:02:09.610> that<00:02:10.610> scrolls<00:02:11.060> through<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:11.420> tables

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
buttons that scrolls through the tables

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.550 
buttons that scrolls through the tables
now<00:02:14.000> you<00:02:14.060> see<00:02:14.180> there's<00:02:14.360> a<00:02:14.450> slight<00:02:14.630> delay<00:02:15.050> there

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
now you see there's a slight delay there

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.770 
now you see there's a slight delay there
for<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.430> playfield<00:02:16.880> to<00:02:17.090> come<00:02:17.239> up<00:02:17.420> it's

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
for the playfield to come up it's

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.570 
for the playfield to come up it's
because<00:02:18.110> some<00:02:18.380> of<00:02:18.410> these<00:02:18.590> it's<00:02:19.220> actually

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
because some of these it's actually

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.740 
because some of these it's actually
running<00:02:19.760> a<00:02:19.910> video<00:02:20.060> in<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:20.570> background

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
original machines the sound wasn't that

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:08.949 
original machines the sound wasn't that
great<00:04:07.550> to<00:04:07.670> begin<00:04:07.760> with<00:04:08.090> on<00:04:08.209> a<00:04:08.240> lot<00:04:08.450> of<00:04:08.600> them

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
great to begin with on a lot of them

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:12.130 
great to begin with on a lot of them
and<00:04:09.760> the<00:04:10.760> back<00:04:11.030> glass<00:04:11.300> image<00:04:11.690> there<00:04:11.870> looks<00:04:12.050> a

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
and the back glass image there looks a

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.020 
and the back glass image there looks a
little<00:04:12.260> washed<00:04:12.590> out<00:04:12.890> because<00:04:13.160> of<00:04:13.459> the<00:04:13.550> camera

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
little washed out because of the camera

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.330 
little washed out because of the camera
it<00:04:14.540> actually<00:04:15.320> looks<00:04:15.530> a<00:04:15.650> much<00:04:15.920> clearer<00:04:16.310> than

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
it actually looks a much clearer than

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.960 
it actually looks a much clearer than
that<00:04:16.519> in<00:04:16.790> person<00:04:18.040> play<00:04:19.040> field<00:04:19.310> looks<00:04:19.670> very

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
that in person play field looks very

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.640 
that in person play field looks very
good<00:04:20.299> and<00:04:20.570> sharp<00:04:21.850> and<00:04:23.169> there's<00:04:24.169> our<00:04:24.350> balls

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
good and sharp and there's our balls

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.180 
good and sharp and there's our balls
we're<00:04:24.980> sitting<00:04:25.280> and<00:04:25.460> ready<00:04:25.640> to<00:04:25.700> be<00:04:25.880> launched

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
we're sitting and ready to be launched

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.770 
we're sitting and ready to be launched
now<00:04:28.190> it's<00:04:28.340> obviously<00:04:28.790> hard<00:04:29.120> to<00:04:29.270> play<00:04:29.450> pinball

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
now it's obviously hard to play pinball

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.570 
now it's obviously hard to play pinball
and<00:04:30.020> you're<00:04:30.350> holding<00:04:30.650> the<00:04:30.710> camera<00:04:30.740> and<00:04:31.370> I<00:04:31.430> only

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
and you're holding the camera and I only

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:40.240 
and you're holding the camera and I only
got<00:04:31.820> one<00:04:31.880> flipper<00:04:32.360> to<00:04:32.450> use<00:04:34.210> but<00:04:38.470> these<00:04:39.470> do<00:04:39.890> run

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
got one flipper to use but these do run

00:04:40.250 --> 00:05:15.270 
got one flipper to use but these do run
very<00:04:40.790> smoothly<00:04:41.240> on<00:04:41.570> here

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.439 

obviously<00:05:16.280> all<00:05:16.430> tables<00:05:16.879> are<00:05:16.970> a<00:05:17.030> little<00:05:17.210> bit

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:17.449 
obviously all tables are a little bit

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:20.140 
obviously all tables are a little bit
different<00:05:18.280> this<00:05:19.280> one's<00:05:19.550> one<00:05:19.759> it<00:05:19.879> placed

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
different this one's one it placed

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:30.040 
different this one's one it placed
pretty<00:05:20.599> fast<00:05:20.990> pretty<00:05:21.470> quick<00:05:21.770> actions<00:05:28.870> you<00:05:29.870> can

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
pretty fast pretty quick actions you can

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.309 
pretty fast pretty quick actions you can
see<00:05:30.289> it<00:05:30.440> does<00:05:30.710> have<00:05:30.740> the<00:05:31.099> DMD<00:05:31.580> display<00:05:32.319> which

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:33.319 
see it does have the DMD display which

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:35.860
