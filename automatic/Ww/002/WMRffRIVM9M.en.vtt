00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:07.200
 in the first period they recede 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.480
 way too much it even goes below 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.910
 its middle line and this initiative 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.549
 personal to perhaps palliate a 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.080
 lack of play she is not a carrier 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.140
 because the game is not better 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.160
 all is foolish in the end is what you 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.920
 can understand what I mean 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.420
 but louis or not if the market in 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.180
 second period he may do it 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.830
 still in a leadership role in 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.390
 picking up but he's a lot more 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.279
 high he 's thirty meters when he's doing there 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.140
 as well the pass to matuidi it to 20 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.880
 goal meters when he does he is he 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.649
 is much higher the block and more 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.870
 Upstairs there not initiate him to 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.020
 to wander around and want to go abidal 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.690
 especially it breaks in France 3 I come back 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.969
 on one thing that supporters are 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.070
 happy when you win the matches 3 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.920
 040 myself the first I'm happy 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.510
 and it makes me happy but now he 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.879
 there is still no game project and 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.010
 even more when criticized and that 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.480
 players not pass loved playing 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.160
 individually what is still 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.320
 a collective football sport I want 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.060
 to say if in addition there is a player like 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.670
 ibrahimovic who has a lot of experience 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.659
 does the same thing and in addition as said 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.220
 daniel dessaint by cons I'm 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.140
 okay and daniel the fact that they 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.330
 go downstairs under the pretext that there is 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.890
 no I do not think he arranges the 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.810
 psg business is quite the opposite 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.850
 they are causing much more 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.189
 problems and the same request ancelotti 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.330
 where he is because if he decides in 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.890
 these boxes is reached it says nothing 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.659
 but that's why this is so it decides 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.890
 to do what he wants when he wants 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.900
 and that the coach would tell him 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.860
 automatically it means what 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.000
 well as the environments they are weak 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.320
 I'm going down I'm going to do the 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.390
 middle- aged job and I'm going to do 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.430
 also the attackers blitz to show 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.320
 really that it's me who does everything and 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.759
 that makes it so bad because me six 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.619
 days with me ibrahimovic when I 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.299
 I was playing I never accepted 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.009
 that the attacker drop each made 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.049
 his job exactly I agree 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.820
 with you and once and for all 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.369
 to close on the subject as you say ali 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.960
 it will take one day understand that we 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.049
 wants to be enthusiastic and there is no 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.969
 problem but our role is not that 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.320
 to get excited that you samuel I 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.430
 do not know if he's still here they want 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.229
 to party they will they do this 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.520
 that he wants there is no problem is 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.500
 one and three years the same role that we 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.120
 you your role its supporters of psg tu 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.960
 Do you want to get excited? 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.590
 What do you want 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.790
 we hear them come and go 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.950
 those who come to say when 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.340
 marseille that and had chained six 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.840
 victories 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.190
 it's beautiful it's perfect you can 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.540
 play the title and then four bad 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.010
 results and limit they came here 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.600
 cut the veins live and then a 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.450
 victory at ajaccio but finally the 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.400
 always in the game so we can be 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.620
 a little more posed beat the dinamo 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.480
 zagreb 3 4 5 0 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.620
 I want to draw any teaching 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.620
 point the line
