00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.860
 this mission is with them the idea Burt group of companies 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:30.019
 After the winter months, they should rather undergo a spring check 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.840
 When it was extremely cold, pipes could be frozen over 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.330
 and the masonry cracks 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.420
 catch the shirt and bow tie 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.030
 can not have spared anything and hidden the facade 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.480
 the house Zoar suffers just like the human I'm sorry interface 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.670
 and it is quite good when the warm season starts and it has to increase 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.030
 a health check led the house 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.280
 to call that sure that sometimes no damage can be detected and fort 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.500
 on the other hand, the longer RP is the admissibility of the house 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.910
 to back up 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.360
 every homeowner 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.530
 should perform the so-called spring check at his house 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.659
 no one can fix them with some skill themselves 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.290
 This can prevent happy consequential damage 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.930
 Bengtsson Sweden should be conditionally checked by an expert 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:22.909
 become 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:24.170
 So all the damage 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.030
 are massive and serious as for example in the education release 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.759
 Education that is something very unusual that percent then leads 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:32.330
 on 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.540
 the damage back which you can not fix but everything 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.830
 quite normal after the winter appearance, for example, silicone joints that often go 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.520
 looked after the children 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.149
 check and make yourself or make gutters out of rooms 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.149
 or gutters check yourself that you can do everything yourself 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.040
 dampened outer walls are no cause for concern these mostly dry from 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.130
 even until the moisture is ready squat in height of the house 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.980
 be careful 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.999
 because now that I know you, what should one do on 2 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:11.750
 It always depends on where and how the moisture contains the 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.900
 Moisture is always the most dangerous thing the house is there 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.280
 is 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.779
 you really have to AR 

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:20.439
 look it up and look regularly so that all joints have an opening 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:22.449
 can come in through moisture 

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:24.839
 Low earners are serviced 

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:27.710
 What must I be sure that the moisture from the bed 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.979
 if she's ever in the house then it probably already has it 

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:35.009
 Menne minute too late and what are you doing there are many possibilities 

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:38.669
 but that depends on where the moisture is coming in. Great and big 

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:42.349
 old Hendrik Wüst old building in between we will be reasonable if that 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:45.379
 so if the humidity is already in the house then a man with an expert too 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:48.379
 speak
