00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.610
 how to decorate the chopsticks for 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.100
 feather style hair we need 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.370
 wooden sticks and that's like for the 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.080
 skewers or potatoes palettes thick lath 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.699

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.089
 choose the color that you like the most 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:24.150
 scissors cutter sand a ribbon very very 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:25.200
 finite and gun to stick stones and 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.510
 stones 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.640
 preferably of efforts 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.710
 here we are going to use the technique of 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.690
 Fancy feathers in the box 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.480
 description I will leave the link for 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.090
 if you have to watch the video we sharpen the 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.820
 tips with a pencil sharpener or with a cutter 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.760
 as it is more comfortable if necessary 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.160
 we choose it to remove the rough 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.160
 We cut two pieces of ribbon from it 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.230
 size 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.370
 we put a line of glue in a 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.380
 stick end 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.830
 and we stick the edge of the ribbon 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.830
 and then the other so that they remain 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.830
 United 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.920
 we cut a curved shape 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.280
 and what will you say? 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.150
 it is not necessary but if you want you can 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.370
 varnish it I leave you also in the box 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.960
 information the link so you can see how 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.100
 make a varnish for crafts with 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.250
 unicel 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.409
 let's put a drop of glue and 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.070
 we will begin to roll the bar 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.070
 delgadito 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:04.140
 and now let's put glamor 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.030
 we heat the gun and we start 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.900
 hitting stones in the central part 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.890
 between the feathers to be filled and also 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.890
 back because no 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.870
 and that's how it's going to look good this is 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:23.620

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:26.049
