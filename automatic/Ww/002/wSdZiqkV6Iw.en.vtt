00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:10.469
 and all the same here the micros but 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.080
 I am marking one more day and we are with a 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.969
 minecraft tutorial this tutorial I'm going 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.220
 to explain how to make one of those four 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.420
 giants as you will know all four 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.420
 they are this size 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.600
 of this size but as you will have seen 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.320
 many are people who make them very much 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.920
 even bigger 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:36.880
 sometimes 100% blocks or not because I 'm going 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:40.920
 to teach with the first of all we are going to 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.970
 need a led marc and redstone torch 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.400
 well first of all we are going to do 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.470
 let's put a landmark here and let's go 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.989
 to put the network here as much as 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:53.060
 You see we have been charged this is like 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:55.550
 let's say it is delimiting us 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.600
 to one of the limits that we left him 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:01.440
 let's put here 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.019
 another lamp and here to cut this 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.970
 current a torch arrest and we already have 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.450
 here that it has begun to be delimited 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.360
 on this side then we go here that 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.840
 this the limit that we are going to put 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.840
 we can here 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.020
 wait a moment ago 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.439
 apparently here was a flaw for the 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.439
 calls 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:44.830
 let's go here 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:48.920
 we cut it and we have what 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:51.909
 is this now we would just miss this one 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.909
 come here 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.180
 short 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.170
 but the brand is wrong because you 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:02.750
 since it has is like this we would already have 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.870
 a square like that so now let's go 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:09.860
 here and with the right click 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.860
 and we click 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.330
 this red area is going to be marked once 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.150
 that we have this red area we take a 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.710
 qualy 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.170
 Y 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.980
 in theory if you put much subtracting the 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.980
 ass you will have like this 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:33.210
 but 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.940
 you go here do not remember that if you go to 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.950
 put on this side the qualy you would have 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.780
 to cut here because if it would not open 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:44.430
 the circuit since the rest let's say 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:47.180
 with a stop we put here the qualy and you see 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.180
 that has been delimited 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.530
 that we already have a size aquarium 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.410
 giant 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.910
 you see it 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.910
 I put this so that you compare 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.980
 compare is with that 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:11.060
 now what we would do would be and here 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.060
 we can remove the remaining 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.580
 we also have removed the landmark here 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:29.780
 and I believe that others have already 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:32.900
 disappeared because the motorcycle 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:36.560
 the engines as you know how we have 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:39.709
 red ton ton network then let's go to these are 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.130
 of stirling that is then removed 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.130
 carbon 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.090
 one 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.010
 and 3 and well now this is going to start what 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.210
 what is doing the bitch a moment I'm going to 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.310
 put the video of the moment that is done 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:59.709
 the qualy so I teach it for you to see 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:03.650
 it works 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:07.040
 we continue and good as you will see we continue 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.780
 here the good finished gang has already 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.480
 finished building is not over 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.870
 to excavate logically and as you can see 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:18.440
 already beginning to excavate that this change 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:21.889
 engine for a fuel that goes 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.930
 faster it heats up earlier but 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:25.849
 we go fast that green plus I put the 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.540
 chest to deposit the 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:32.840
 things and good people this is all 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:35.000
 so the qualy is done 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:38.240
 the big picture good here is a 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.260
 small mistake that before this does not 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:44.300
 Do not worry, it's not a bad thing or anything 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:46.699
 simply a visual error which and 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.139
 it will still work anyway 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:49.910
 people I hope you have a lot of luck with 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.350
 your big emails that you find 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:56.229
 many materials and if you liked 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.229
 subscribe be commented and punctual goodbye
