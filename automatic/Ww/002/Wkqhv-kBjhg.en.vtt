00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:16.060
 Good day, welcome to Saint Hubert, 2015, 

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.860
 on this beautiful, sunny day. 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.660
 A bit too sunny even, because of hunting horn 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.770
 to blow this is not ideal 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:35.360
 With an atmosphere that I have found here for 40 years, 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.960
 I am happy to come back to this mythical place, 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.260
 Saint Hubert in Belgium. 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.860
 I got the chapel from last night 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.460
 Saint Hubert. 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.770
 That is turning back to mythical places 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.760
 in every sense of the word. 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.160
 40 years ago, I was 13 years old, 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.260
 I came here for the first time. And now, so many years later, 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.560
 in other capacities, as a monitor, 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.760
 I greet all the monitors that enabled me 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.270
 come back as a monitor yourself. 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.860
 Super, magnificent. 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.560
 We are very satisfied with our first internship 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.460
 from Saint Hubert, 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.860
 especially with this nice weather and nice atmosphere. 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.960
 A bit warm, warm indeed. 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.160
 The bar is well stocked, what more do you want? 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.860
 The monitors are super, sympathetic and very competent. 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.960
 It is really enjoyable here on the internship 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.160
 from Saint Hubert so many good musicians and 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.660
 sure to meet excellent monitors. 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.160
 The best of the world. 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.960
 The atmosphere is great and it is very pleasant 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.860
 to see how the locals live 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:05.160
 accept the whole event. 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.170
 Saint Hubert is a historic city, 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.570
 full of traditions and memories of the hunting horn. 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.860
 Almost everyone here has already been to Saint Hubert. 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.060
 I came here from an early age as an intern 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.360
 and now as a monitor. With a great organization, 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.960
 nice framework and renowned monitors 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:34.060
 high quality from all over the world. 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.660
 I really appreciate the framework here, it is delicious, 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.170
 a small village in the middle of the woods. 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.260
 The monitors are ingenious, and we are making good progress. 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.860
 We are very satisfied here in Saint Hubert 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.760
 about the quality of the monitors. 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.870
 There is a particularly good atmosphere and very good weather. 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.570
 Simply ideal. 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.070
 For the first time we are very satisfied 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.660
 about the quality of the monitors, the beautiful weather. 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.370
 The trainees look happy 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.660
 and we are lucky to be able to keep the bar open. 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.260
 And the bar runs well, so everything goes well. 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.160
 Everyone seems satisfied with the quality delivered. 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.560
 For Saint Hubert, capital of the hunt 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.070
 and nature, it is for our municipality 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.670
 an honor to have this international hunting experience 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:42.970
 to be welcomed again. And I have heard, 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.060
 we left for a long time. 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.970
 Bravo to everyone for this great internship. 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.560
 Thank the organizers: 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.260
 the monitors, the volunteers, the trainees and 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.960
 everyone who participated in this internship. 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.293
