00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.074
I marinated the whole eggplants in early autumn.

00:00:06.074 --> 00:00:08.175
I gathered them in my garden.

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:11.387
You can see this recipe in my videos.

00:00:11.387 --> 00:00:14.195
Time passed. It's already winter.

00:00:14.195 --> 00:00:18.700
Today I want to prepare a salad of marinated eggplants.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.555
For this recipe we need:

00:00:20.555 --> 00:00:25.200
eggplants, onion, a little salt,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.685
homemade sunflower oil,

00:00:28.685 --> 00:00:32.000
little greenery: dill or parsley.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.026
You can do it without greenery.

00:00:36.026 --> 00:00:38.900
Open the jar.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.315
I got of 4 eggplant.

00:00:43.315 --> 00:00:46.615
This is enough for a salad. I put the rest into the refrigerator.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:55.400
Cut the eggplants into cubes.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:07.800
We shift sliced eggplants into a bowl, where we will mix all the ingredients.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.977
Cut the onion.

00:01:16.977 --> 00:01:24.105
Cut the onion finely. I do not like large chunks onions in salads.

00:01:24.105 --> 00:01:27.095
Slice very thinly lengthwise.

00:01:27.095 --> 00:01:31.800
Then also thinly crosswise.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.735
A little more chopped.

00:01:37.735 --> 00:01:42.400
To onion become smaller.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.800
Enough.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.285
We shift onion to the eggplants.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.200
Remain greenery.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.900
I washed it. Take not a whole bunch, a bit.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.216
Chop finely.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.500
We shift the greenery to the other products.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.800
You can use garlic instead of onion.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.474
Now salt a little. If you want, you can pepper.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.655
Add the fragrant sunflower oil.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.495
Stir.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.314
You will cook the eggplants salad literally in 10 minutes

00:02:45.314 --> 00:02:49.015
having such a wonderful home-made half-stuff.

00:02:49.015 --> 00:02:52.754
Cook with pleasure and enjoy!

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.900
