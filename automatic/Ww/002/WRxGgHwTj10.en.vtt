00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
get scared about shellfish and fish and

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.220 
get scared about shellfish and fish and
I<00:02:33.790> was<00:02:33.910> all<00:02:34.030> over<00:02:34.180> cooking<00:02:34.600> under<00:02:34.810> cooking<00:02:35.080> and

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
I was all over cooking under cooking and

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.810 
I was all over cooking under cooking and
knowing<00:02:35.380> exactly<00:02:35.560> what<00:02:35.860> to<00:02:35.950> do<00:02:36.070> with<00:02:36.220> it<00:02:36.310> but

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
knowing exactly what to do with it but

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.550 
knowing exactly what to do with it but
my<00:02:36.850> advice<00:02:37.090> really<00:02:37.540> is<00:02:37.660> to<00:02:37.780> keep<00:02:37.960> it<00:02:38.110> simple

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
my advice really is to keep it simple

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.130 
my advice really is to keep it simple
and<00:02:38.710> just<00:02:39.610> let<00:02:39.790> the<00:02:39.880> lovely<00:02:40.270> fresh<00:02:40.720> flavors

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
and just let the lovely fresh flavors

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.840 
and just let the lovely fresh flavors
come<00:02:41.320> through<00:02:41.350> and<00:02:42.100> just<00:02:42.280> with<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:42.490> minimal

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
come through and just with the minimal

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.450 
come through and just with the minimal
amount<00:02:43.090> of<00:02:43.150> cooking<00:02:43.840> on<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:44.020> seafood<00:02:44.680> that's

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
amount of cooking on the seafood that's

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:46.620 
amount of cooking on the seafood that's
why<00:02:45.580> pasta<00:02:45.940> dish<00:02:46.090> something<00:02:46.390> like<00:02:46.510> this

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
why pasta dish something like this

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.440 
why pasta dish something like this
really<00:02:47.260> lends<00:02:47.590> itself<00:02:47.920> to<00:02:48.070> and<00:02:48.520> the<00:02:49.000> shellfish

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
really lends itself to and the shellfish

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.930 
really lends itself to and the shellfish
and<00:02:49.630> seafood<00:02:49.690> because<00:02:50.650> it's<00:02:51.190> very<00:02:51.370> quick<00:02:51.880> to

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940
