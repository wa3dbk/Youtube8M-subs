00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.329 
this is the free motion quilting
tutorial<00:00:02.220> for<00:00:02.490> spiral<00:00:03.179> of<00:00:03.389> spirals<00:00:04.160> this<00:00:05.160> is

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
tutorial for spiral of spirals this is

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.240 
tutorial for spiral of spirals this is
stitched<00:00:05.609> by<00:00:05.910> first<00:00:06.299> starting<00:00:06.540> with<00:00:07.529> a<00:00:07.560> large

stitched by first starting with a large

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.610 
stitched by first starting with a large
spiral<00:00:09.030> and<00:00:09.510> it<00:00:09.750> might<00:00:09.900> take<00:00:10.080> a<00:00:10.110> little<00:00:10.320> bit<00:00:10.500> of

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
spiral and it might take a little bit of

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.759 
spiral and it might take a little bit of
time<00:00:10.920> for<00:00:11.219> you<00:00:11.370> to<00:00:11.490> stitch<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:12.000> whole<00:00:12.179> thing

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:12.769 
time for you to stitch the whole thing

time for you to stitch the whole thing
you<00:00:13.769> want<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.099> kind<00:00:14.280> of<00:00:14.340> fill<00:00:14.700> your<00:00:15.240> entire

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
quilting space whatever space you're

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.970 
quilting space whatever space you're
trying<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:18.000> fill<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.510> in<00:00:19.230> this<00:00:19.350> situation<00:00:19.890> I

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
trying to fill and in this situation I

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.340 
trying to fill and in this situation I
was<00:00:20.160> filling<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.550> four<00:00:20.789> inch<00:00:21.000> square<00:00:21.510> which<00:00:22.170> can

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
was filling a four inch square which can

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.590 
was filling a four inch square which can
be<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.560> little<00:00:22.830> tricky<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.460> fill<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.850> square<00:00:24.300> with

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
be a little tricky to fill a square with

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.230 
be a little tricky to fill a square with
a<00:00:24.630> circular<00:00:25.170> shape<00:00:25.519> if<00:00:26.519> you<00:00:26.670> find<00:00:26.880> yourself

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
a circular shape if you find yourself

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.450 
a circular shape if you find yourself
having<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.570> trouble<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:27.990> had<00:00:28.260> maybe<00:00:29.250> you

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
having the trouble I had maybe you

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.089 
having the trouble I had maybe you
should<00:00:29.670> mark<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.240> because<00:00:30.630> my<00:00:30.869> circle<00:00:31.859> didn't

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
should mark it because my circle didn't

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.910 
should mark it because my circle didn't
end<00:00:32.219> up<00:00:32.369> exactly<00:00:32.910> being<00:00:33.210> circular<00:00:33.899> it<00:00:34.620> ended

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
end up exactly being circular it ended

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.090 
end up exactly being circular it ended
up<00:00:35.100> actually<00:00:35.340> being<00:00:35.579> rather<00:00:36.120> oval<00:00:36.719> in<00:00:36.930> shape

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
up actually being rather oval in shape

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.709 
up actually being rather oval in shape
but<00:00:38.100> we're<00:00:38.489> not<00:00:38.670> really<00:00:39.000> keeping<00:00:39.180> score<00:00:39.660> I

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
but we're not really keeping score I

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.920 
but we're not really keeping score I
hope<00:00:40.020> not<00:00:40.230> at<00:00:40.440> least<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:41.460> anyway<00:00:42.270> once<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.719> get

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
hope not at least so anyway once you get

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.709 
hope not at least so anyway once you get
to<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.230> center<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.620> your<00:00:43.800> spiral<00:00:44.539> and<00:00:45.539> I'm

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
to the center of your spiral and I'm

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.229 
to the center of your spiral and I'm
almost<00:00:46.140> getting<00:00:46.530> there<00:00:46.680> right<00:00:47.010> now<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:48.120> the

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
almost getting there right now in the

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.959 
almost getting there right now in the
design<00:00:48.649> once<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.829> get<00:00:50.010> into<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.579> center<00:00:50.940> of

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
design once you get into the center of

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.680 
design once you get into the center of
your<00:00:51.210> spiral<00:00:51.510> you're<00:00:52.260> going<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:53.690> backtrack

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
your spiral you're going to backtrack

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.610 
your spiral you're going to backtrack
and<00:00:55.260> echo<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.399> spiral<00:00:57.000> about<00:00:57.809> an<00:00:58.170> eighth<00:00:58.410> of

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
and echo the spiral about an eighth of

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.830 
and echo the spiral about an eighth of
an<00:00:58.739> inch<00:00:58.859> away<00:00:59.340> from<00:00:59.789> your<00:01:00.270> first<00:01:00.480> sign<00:01:00.719> of

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
an inch away from your first sign of

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.319 
an inch away from your first sign of
stitching<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.309> takes<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.670> little<00:01:02.760> while<00:01:03.059> to

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
stitching and it takes a little while to

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.780 
stitching and it takes a little while to
get<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:03.899> initial<00:01:04.350> foundation<00:01:04.830> laid<00:01:05.489> but

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
get this initial foundation laid but

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.850 
get this initial foundation laid but
once<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.119> get<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.420> laid<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:07.110> provides<00:01:07.590> the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
once you get it laid it provides the

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.510 
once you get it laid it provides the
base<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.460> all<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.820> rest<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.420> your<00:01:09.570> spirals

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
base of all the rest of your spirals

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.910 
base of all the rest of your spirals
this<00:01:11.520> design<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.180> called<00:01:12.450> spiral<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.350> spirals

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
this design is called spiral of spirals

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.039 
this design is called spiral of spirals
which<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.490> essentially<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.630> spiral

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
which is essentially it is a spiral

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.340 
which is essentially it is a spiral
being<00:01:17.009> made<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.670> spirals<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.479> as<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.750> spiral<00:01:19.200> of

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
being made of spirals and as a spiral of

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.350 
being made of spirals and as a spiral of
itself<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.549> thought<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:21.030> was<00:01:21.090> kind<00:01:21.330> of

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
itself so I thought that was kind of

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.960 
itself so I thought that was kind of
cool<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:22.439> it's<00:01:22.619> definitely<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:23.009> fun<00:01:23.280> very

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
cool and it's definitely a fun very

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.969 
cool and it's definitely a fun very
attention-getting<00:01:24.869> design<00:01:25.350> this<00:01:25.799> is

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
attention-getting design this is

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.050 
attention-getting design this is
something<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.340> you're<00:01:26.549> gonna<00:01:26.670> want<00:01:27.000> to

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
something that you're gonna want to

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.390 
something that you're gonna want to
place<00:01:27.330> in<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.259> center<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.829> block<00:01:29.070> and

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
place in the center of a block and

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.899 
place in the center of a block and
really<00:01:29.909> let<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.390> do<00:01:30.750> all<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:32.009> work<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.790> know

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
really let it do all the work you know

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.230 
really let it do all the work you know
really<00:01:33.270> let<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.600> sit<00:01:33.869> there<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.400> kind<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.610> get

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
really let it sit there and kind of get

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.390 
really let it sit there and kind of get
all<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.509> attention<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.350> certainly<00:01:38.130> wouldn't

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
all the attention you certainly wouldn't

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.030 
all the attention you certainly wouldn't
want<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.880> try<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.600> place<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:40.320> near<00:01:40.950> a

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
want to try and place this near a

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.910 
want to try and place this near a
quilting<00:01:41.670> motif<00:01:42.030> or<00:01:42.299> on<00:01:42.420> top<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.869> or<00:01:43.079> behind<00:01:43.500> a

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
quilting motif or on top of or behind a

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.560 
quilting motif or on top of or behind a
quilting<00:01:44.310> motif<00:01:44.670> because<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.299> would<00:01:45.390> be

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
quilting motif because it would be

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.950 
quilting motif because it would be
basically<00:01:46.409> impossible<00:01:47.040> without<00:01:47.790> marking<00:01:48.570> to

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
basically impossible without marking to

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.609 
basically impossible without marking to
keep<00:01:49.200> all<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.860> lines<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.549> your<00:01:50.700> spiral

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
keep all the lines of your spiral

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.760 
keep all the lines of your spiral
consistent<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:53.159> even<00:01:54.409> this<00:01:55.409> is<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.649> little

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
consistent and even this is a little

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.240 
consistent and even this is a little
time-consuming<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:57.030> slightly<00:01:57.570> tedious<00:01:58.250> but

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
time-consuming and slightly tedious but

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.149 
time-consuming and slightly tedious but
echoing<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.360> one<00:02:00.570> of<00:02:00.659> those<00:02:00.810> skills<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:02.070> we

echoing is one of those skills that we

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.130 
echoing is one of those skills that we
have<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.490> learn<00:02:02.670> in<00:02:02.969> free<00:02:03.390> motion<00:02:03.600> quilting

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
have to learn in free motion quilting

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.730 
have to learn in free motion quilting
and<00:02:04.670> really<00:02:05.670> helps<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.530> kind<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.590> as<00:02:07.710> a

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
and really helps to kind of as a

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.219 
and really helps to kind of as a
foundation<00:02:08.429> for<00:02:08.910> all<00:02:09.300> free<00:02:09.599> motion<00:02:09.780> designs

so<00:02:10.920> if<00:02:11.039> you<00:02:11.160> feel<00:02:11.340> like<00:02:11.459> you<00:02:11.610> don't<00:02:12.120> know

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
so if you feel like you don't know

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.130 
so if you feel like you don't know
how<00:02:12.760> to<00:02:12.819> echo<00:02:13.209> very<00:02:13.450> well<00:02:13.689> this<00:02:13.840> would<00:02:14.019> be<00:02:14.109> a

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
how to echo very well this would be a

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.830 
how to echo very well this would be a
good<00:02:14.319> design<00:02:14.500> to<00:02:14.769> practice<00:02:15.219> it<00:02:15.510> once<00:02:16.510> you<00:02:16.689> get

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
good design to practice it once you get

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.170 
good design to practice it once you get
back<00:02:17.140> into<00:02:17.439> the<00:02:17.769> inside<00:02:18.159> of<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.340> spiral<00:02:18.819> then

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
back into the inside of the spiral then

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.959 
back into the inside of the spiral then
you're<00:02:19.359> going<00:02:19.629> to<00:02:19.780> start<00:02:20.049> stitching<00:02:20.969> circular

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:21.969 
you're going to start stitching circular

you're going to start stitching circular
shapes<00:02:22.329> and<00:02:23.430> then<00:02:24.430> go<00:02:24.670> right<00:02:24.700> inside<00:02:25.120> of<00:02:25.480> it

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
shapes and then go right inside of it

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:31.259 
shapes and then go right inside of it
and<00:02:25.890> create<00:02:26.890> a<00:02:26.920> spiral<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:30.310> it's<00:02:30.519> up<00:02:30.790> to<00:02:30.819> you
