00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
how to remove a M gel polish so at the

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.629 
how to remove a M gel polish so at the
moment<00:00:09.900> I've<00:00:10.170> got<00:00:10.200> Jessica's<00:00:10.860> generator<00:00:11.340> on

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
moment I've got Jessica's generator on

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.220 
moment I've got Jessica's generator on
but<00:00:11.849> I<00:00:11.910> know<00:00:11.969> that<00:00:12.210> this<00:00:12.330> also<00:00:12.780> works<00:00:12.990> with

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
but I know that this also works with

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.829 
but I know that this also works with
Gela<00:00:13.620> Shaz<00:00:13.920> well<00:00:14.130> I<00:00:14.370> would<00:00:15.360> think<00:00:15.630> that<00:00:15.690> this

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
Gela Shaz well I would think that this

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.540 
Gela Shaz well I would think that this
is<00:00:15.960> how<00:00:16.109> you<00:00:16.139> move<00:00:16.379> some<00:00:17.010> of<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.220> other<00:00:17.340> gel

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
is how you move some of the other gel

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.070 
is how you move some of the other gel
polishes<00:00:17.940> but<00:00:18.150> I'm<00:00:18.240> not<00:00:18.420> sure<00:00:18.660> I've<00:00:18.840> only

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
polishes but I'm not sure I've only

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.740 
polishes but I'm not sure I've only
tried<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:19.980> with<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.730> generation<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.539> the

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
tried it with the generation and the

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.679 
tried it with the generation and the
jelly<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:22.859> this<00:00:23.550> has<00:00:23.699> been<00:00:23.850> on<00:00:23.970> for<00:00:24.300> about<00:00:24.480> a
