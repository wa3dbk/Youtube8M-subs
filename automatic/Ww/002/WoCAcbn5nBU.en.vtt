00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.670 
their videos so much that it inspired me
to<00:04:02.160> actually<00:04:02.880> have<00:04:03.090> an<00:04:03.360> HD<00:04:03.630> PVR<00:04:03.810> but<00:04:04.320> it<00:04:04.380> broke

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
to actually have an HD PVR but it broke

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.220 
to actually have an HD PVR but it broke
and<00:04:04.980> when<00:04:05.820> I<00:04:05.850> get<00:04:05.970> a<00:04:06.120> new<00:04:06.330> one<00:04:06.540> it<00:04:06.840> somehow

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
and when I get a new one it somehow

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.110 
and when I get a new one it somehow
starts<00:04:07.650> working<00:04:07.980> in<00:04:08.190> but<00:04:08.489> hey<00:04:08.880> whatever

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
starts working in but hey whatever

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.590 
starts working in but hey whatever
that's<00:04:09.780> how<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:09.959> cookie<00:04:10.230> crumbles<00:04:10.260> so<00:04:11.600> this

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
that's how the cookie crumbles so this

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.600 
that's how the cookie crumbles so this
commentary<00:04:13.110> I<00:04:13.530> might<00:04:13.920> do<00:04:14.100> for<00:04:14.370> it
