that i was using off of my kitchen table
onto<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.500> floor<00:02:31.739> beneath<00:02:31.980> it<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:32.430> it<00:02:32.940> did

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
onto the floor beneath it and it did

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.839 
onto the floor beneath it and it did
crack<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.569> back<00:02:34.079> of<00:02:34.379> the<00:02:34.709> phone<00:02:35.220> there's<00:02:35.790> a

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
crack the back of the phone there's a

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.360 
crack the back of the phone there's a
small<00:02:36.060> hairline<00:02:36.329> crack<00:02:36.870> from<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.440> camera<00:02:38.190> out

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
small hairline crack from the camera out

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.430 
small hairline crack from the camera out
to<00:02:38.909> the<00:02:39.030> edge<00:02:39.150> of<00:02:39.329> the<00:02:39.390> device<00:02:39.780> you<00:02:40.230> can't

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
to the edge of the device you can't

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.530 
to the edge of the device you can't
really<00:02:40.560> feel<00:02:40.799> it<00:02:41.010> but<00:02:41.250> it's<00:02:41.280> there<00:02:41.489> and<00:02:41.940> i

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
really feel it but it's there and i

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.750 
really feel it but it's there and i
think<00:02:42.959> when<00:02:43.109> i<00:02:43.140> was<00:02:43.319> at<00:02:43.439> Google<00:02:43.799> and<00:02:44.069> the<00:02:44.099> Rubin

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
think when i was at Google and the Rubin

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.119 
think when i was at Google and the Rubin
had<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:45.569> phone<00:02:45.900> which<00:02:46.140> had<00:02:46.319> a<00:02:46.349> cracked<00:02:46.650> back<00:02:46.920> as

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
had a phone which had a cracked back as

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:49.460 
had a phone which had a cracked back as
well<00:02:47.370> so<00:02:48.060> that's<00:02:48.659> definitely<00:02:48.870> be<00:02:49.170> something

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
well so that's definitely be something

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.899 
well so that's definitely be something
we're<00:02:49.590> hearing<00:02:49.859> about<00:02:49.920> with<00:02:50.220> this<00:02:50.340> device<00:02:50.609> it

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 
we're hearing about with this device it

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:52.520 
we're hearing about with this device it
is<00:02:51.000> kind<00:02:51.269> of<00:02:51.329> a<00:02:51.420> negative<00:02:51.810> it's<00:02:52.349> a<00:02:52.409> nice

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
is kind of a negative it's a nice

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.530 
is kind of a negative it's a nice
looking<00:02:52.709> phone<00:02:53.129> the<00:02:53.609> design<00:02:53.909> is<00:02:54.090> not<00:02:54.120> a<00:02:54.269> big

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
looking phone the design is not a big

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.319 
looking phone the design is not a big
departure<00:02:54.870> from<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.530> last<00:02:55.769> Nexus<00:02:56.370> device<00:02:56.700> but

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
departure from the last Nexus device but

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:58.280 
departure from the last Nexus device but
it<00:02:57.389> definitely<00:02:57.510> seems<00:02:57.840> like<00:02:57.930> a<00:02:58.019> more

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
it definitely seems like a more

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.170 
it definitely seems like a more
expensive<00:02:58.680> product<00:02:59.430> there's<00:02:59.970> some<00:03:00.060> nice

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
expensive product there's some nice

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.970 
expensive product there's some nice
attention<00:03:00.420> to<00:03:00.569> detail<00:03:00.629> here<00:03:01.170> as<00:03:01.290> well<00:03:01.470> for

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
attention to detail here as well for

attention to detail here as well for
instance<00:03:02.040> on<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.370> back<00:03:02.519> of<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.790> phone

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
instance on the back of the phone

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.300 
instance on the back of the phone
there's<00:03:03.239> an<00:03:03.359> almost<00:03:03.540> holographic<00:03:04.310> stipple

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
there's an almost holographic stipple

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.129 
there's an almost holographic stipple
pattern<00:03:05.760> that<00:03:05.940> you<00:03:06.000> can't<00:03:06.420> see<00:03:06.569> in<00:03:06.690> most<00:03:06.840> light

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:07.139 
pattern that you can't see in most light

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:08.780 
pattern that you can't see in most light
but<00:03:07.440> once<00:03:07.680> in<00:03:07.799> a<00:03:07.859> while<00:03:08.040> it<00:03:08.220> gets<00:03:08.340> picked<00:03:08.639> up

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
but once in a while it gets picked up

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.580 
but once in a while it gets picked up
and<00:03:09.030> it's<00:03:09.389> kind<00:03:09.659> of<00:03:09.690> cool-looking<00:03:09.870> from<00:03:10.500> a

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
and it's kind of cool-looking from a

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.800 
and it's kind of cool-looking from a
spec<00:03:10.980> standpoint<00:03:11.609> however<00:03:12.180> I<00:03:12.329> think<00:03:12.599> the<00:03:12.690> most

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
spec standpoint however I think the most

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.750 
spec standpoint however I think the most
notable<00:03:13.319> thing<00:03:13.560> about<00:03:13.769> this<00:03:13.950> device<00:03:14.310> is<00:03:14.549> that

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
notable thing about this device is that

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.690 
notable thing about this device is that
there<00:03:15.299> is<00:03:15.450> no<00:03:15.659> LTE<00:03:16.079> version<00:03:16.470> now<00:03:17.280> that's<00:03:17.519> not<00:03:17.639> a

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
there is no LTE version now that's not a

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.819 
there is no LTE version now that's not a
very<00:03:17.879> big<00:03:18.000> deal<00:03:18.419> if<00:03:18.780> you<00:03:18.840> live<00:03:19.319> outside<00:03:19.590> of

Google<00:04:28.140> is<00:04:28.170> also<00:04:28.380> introducing<00:04:28.590> gesture

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
Google is also introducing gesture

typing<00:04:29.610> which<00:04:30.240> is<00:04:30.480> basically<00:04:31.050> their<00:04:31.350> version

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
typing which is basically their version

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.080 
typing which is basically their version
of<00:04:31.860> swype<00:04:32.010> but<00:04:32.520> it<00:04:32.610> works<00:04:32.760> in<00:04:32.910> conjunction

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
of swype but it works in conjunction

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.060

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
and in my testing was pretty good i

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.930 
and in my testing was pretty good i
don't<00:04:37.710> think<00:04:37.920> the<00:04:37.980> prediction<00:04:38.370> is<00:04:38.490> quite<00:04:38.790> as

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
don't think the prediction is quite as

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.750 
don't think the prediction is quite as
good<00:04:39.060> to<00:04:39.180> swipe<00:04:39.420> but<00:04:40.020> it's<00:04:40.590> about<00:04:40.860> ninety-five

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
good to swipe but it's about ninety-five

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.970 
good to swipe but it's about ninety-five
percent<00:04:42.000> as<00:04:42.420> good<00:04:42.630> which<00:04:42.870> is<00:04:43.110> basically<00:04:43.770> good

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
percent as good which is basically good

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.620 
percent as good which is basically good
