00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.520 
know about that one but that's where it
was<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.250> then<00:01:29.610> also<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:30.240> know<00:01:30.540> how<00:01:30.689> daring<00:01:31.439> of

was and then also you know how daring of

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.260 
was and then also you know how daring of
a<00:01:31.590> mission<00:01:31.799> was<00:01:32.070> was<00:01:32.369> this<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.700> do<00:01:32.850> something

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
and I think a lot of people would think

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.380 
and I think a lot of people would think
survival<00:01:35.159> tongs<00:01:35.369> might<00:01:35.670> be<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.850> little<00:01:36.000> crazy
