00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.039 
this way because that's my front perfect
I<00:01:55.280> can<00:01:56.280> go<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.520> side<00:01:56.759> view<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:57.210> can<00:01:57.840> go<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:57.990> a

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
I can go to a side view I can go to a

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.230 
I can go to a side view I can go to a
top<00:01:58.290> view<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.740> little<00:01:59.250> isometric<00:01:59.850> view<00:02:00.000> if<00:02:00.119> we

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
top view a little isometric view if we

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.700 
top view a little isometric view if we
want<00:02:00.560> maybe<00:02:01.560> we<00:02:01.680> want<00:02:01.799> that<00:02:02.009> isometric<00:02:02.310> view

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
want maybe we want that isometric view

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.130 
want maybe we want that isometric view
ok<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:05.040> now<00:02:05.969> maybe<00:02:06.149> over<00:02:06.390> here<00:02:06.420> we<00:02:06.719> want<00:02:06.930> a

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
ok and now maybe over here we want a

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.080 
ok and now maybe over here we want a
back<00:02:07.560> view<00:02:07.590> right

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
back view right

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.440 
back view right
so<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:09.989> can<00:02:10.140> go<00:02:10.200> auxiliary<00:02:10.590> view<00:02:10.800> off<00:02:10.979> this<00:02:11.450> come

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
so I can go auxiliary view off this come

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.580 
so I can go auxiliary view off this come
up<00:02:12.569> this<00:02:12.720> way<00:02:13.400> why<00:02:14.400> not<00:02:14.610> that's<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.390> top<00:02:15.599> I<00:02:15.870> can

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
up this way why not that's the top I can

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.500 
up this way why not that's the top I can
say<00:02:16.739> auxiliary<00:02:17.129> of<00:02:17.220> you<00:02:17.310> off<00:02:17.459> that<00:02:17.700> comes<00:02:18.390> off

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
say auxiliary of you off that comes off

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.000 
say auxiliary of you off that comes off
that<00:02:18.569> way<00:02:18.930> that's<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.260> back<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:19.650> then<00:02:19.769> I<00:02:19.860> can

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
that way that's the back and then I can

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.410 
that way that's the back and then I can
reposition<00:02:20.610> all<00:02:21.000> of<00:02:21.150> this<00:02:23.269> so<00:02:24.269> that

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
reposition all of this so that

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.789 
reposition all of this so that
everything<00:02:24.720> is<00:02:24.989> in<00:02:25.019> here<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:25.379> maybe<00:02:25.470> we<00:02:25.680> don't

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
everything is in here and maybe we don't

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.910 
everything is in here and maybe we don't
need<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:26.160> view<00:02:26.430> okay<00:02:27.440> so<00:02:28.440> we'll<00:02:28.560> delete<00:02:28.769> that

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
need that view okay so we'll delete that

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.920 
need that view okay so we'll delete that
view<00:02:29.160> will<00:02:29.310> delete<00:02:29.519> that<00:02:29.670> for<00:02:29.879> you<00:02:29.970> where

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
view will delete that for you where

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.259 
view will delete that for you where
position<00:02:31.410> things<00:02:31.650> in<00:02:31.799> here<00:02:31.950> like<00:02:32.099> so<00:02:32.370> maybe

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
position things in here like so maybe

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.400 
position things in here like so maybe
I'd<00:02:33.420> like<00:02:33.569> to<00:02:33.690> edit<00:02:34.519> that<00:02:35.519> projected<00:02:36.090> view

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
I'd like to edit that projected view

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.509 
I'd like to edit that projected view
when<00:02:37.410> I<00:02:37.440> do<00:02:37.530> that<00:02:37.739> notice<00:02:37.799> there's<00:02:38.370> this

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
when I do that notice there's this

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.220 
when I do that notice there's this
little<00:02:38.730> value<00:02:39.060> down<00:02:39.209> here<00:02:39.480> I<00:02:39.629> just<00:02:39.989> double

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
little value down here I just double

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.180 
little value down here I just double
click<00:02:40.379> on<00:02:40.440> it<00:02:40.530> that's<00:02:40.709> actually<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.040> view

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
click on it that's actually the view

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.190 
click on it that's actually the view
scale<00:02:41.489> I<00:02:41.730> would<00:02:42.269> like<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.420> scale<00:02:42.750> that<00:02:42.930> back<00:02:42.989> a

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
scale I would like to scale that back a

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.009 
scale I would like to scale that back a
little<00:02:43.440> bit<00:02:43.700> put<00:02:44.700> it<00:02:44.790> here<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.299> maybe<00:02:48.019> shaded

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
little bit put it here and maybe shaded

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.690 
little bit put it here and maybe shaded
one<00:02:49.200> out<00:02:51.049> okay<00:02:52.130> so<00:02:53.130> we<00:02:53.190> have<00:02:53.220> all<00:02:53.340> sorts<00:02:53.640> of

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
one out okay so we have all sorts of

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.360 
one out okay so we have all sorts of
options<00:02:53.879> in<00:02:54.150> here<00:02:54.620> you<00:02:55.620> can<00:02:55.799> set<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.129> scale

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
options in here you can set the scale

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.039 
options in here you can set the scale
you<00:02:56.430> can<00:02:56.640> set<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.000> style<00:02:57.239> you<00:02:57.480> can<00:02:57.510> do<00:02:57.690> it<00:02:57.810> ever

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
you can set the style you can do it ever

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.920 
you can set the style you can do it ever
you<00:02:58.410> want<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:58.680> do<00:02:59.180> let's<00:03:00.180> maybe<00:03:00.329> just<00:03:00.569> position

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
you want to do let's maybe just position

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.420 
you want to do let's maybe just position
this<00:03:01.079> a<00:03:01.110> little<00:03:01.230> bit<00:03:01.440> more<00:03:01.680> we'll<00:03:02.250> add<00:03:02.400> a

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
this a little bit more we'll add a

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.979 
this a little bit more we'll add a
couple<00:03:02.640> basic<00:03:03.060> dimensions<00:03:03.299> and<00:03:03.720> that'll<00:03:03.900> be

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
couple basic dimensions and that'll be

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.289 
couple basic dimensions and that'll be
enough<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.349> give<00:03:04.470> you<00:03:04.560> a<00:03:04.620> good<00:03:04.799> good<00:03:05.129> idea<00:03:05.400> so

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
enough to give you a good good idea so

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:11.330 
enough to give you a good good idea so
my<00:03:06.959> overall<00:03:07.110> from<00:03:07.790> top<00:03:08.790> to<00:03:08.819> bottom<00:03:10.040> it's<00:03:11.040> 38

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
my overall from top to bottom it's 38

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.160 
my overall from top to bottom it's 38
and<00:03:11.489> a<00:03:11.549> half<00:03:12.769> maybe<00:03:13.769> from<00:03:14.840> there<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:15.989> there

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
and a half maybe from there to there

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.319 
and a half maybe from there to there
maybe<00:03:16.799> that's<00:03:17.010> an<00:03:17.130> important<00:03:17.519> dimension<00:03:17.880> for

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
maybe that's an important dimension for

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:23.870 
maybe that's an important dimension for
you<00:03:18.859> we<00:03:19.859> have<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.160> overall<00:03:20.370> length<00:03:21.350> and<00:03:22.880> so

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
you we have the overall length and so

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:30.600 
you we have the overall length and so
forth<00:03:24.150> so<00:03:24.720> on

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.700 

we<00:03:31.150> may<00:03:31.270> be<00:03:31.300> from<00:03:31.570> front<00:03:32.050> to<00:03:32.080> back<00:03:32.170> there<00:03:32.560> as

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:32.710 
we may be from front to back there as

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.190 
we may be from front to back there as
well<00:03:33.360> it's<00:03:34.360> like<00:03:34.480> that<00:03:34.630> you<00:03:34.750> can<00:03:34.870> see<00:03:34.960> you<00:03:35.050> can

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
well it's like that you can see you can

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.170 
well it's like that you can see you can
quickly<00:03:35.410> get<00:03:35.650> your<00:03:35.830> documentation<00:03:36.280> done<00:03:36.580> now

point and maybe that point okay or maybe
the<00:03:54.700> first<00:03:54.850> point<00:03:55.180> we<00:03:55.540> want<00:03:55.720> it<00:03:55.780> to<00:03:55.810> be<00:03:55.930> here

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
the first point we want it to be here

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.820 
the first point we want it to be here
because<00:03:56.200> we<00:03:56.320> want<00:03:56.470> to<00:03:56.560> be<00:03:56.620> a<00:03:56.650> little<00:03:56.740> bit

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
because we want to be a little bit

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.350 
because we want to be a little bit
smaller<00:03:57.420> perfect<00:03:58.420> we'll<00:03:59.200> say<00:03:59.350> okay<00:04:00.360> maybe

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
smaller perfect we'll say okay maybe

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.000 
smaller perfect we'll say okay maybe
we'll<00:04:01.450> move<00:04:01.600> that<00:04:01.750> view<00:04:01.959> down<00:04:02.080> to<00:04:02.200> here<00:04:02.410> and

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
we'll move that view down to here and

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.580 
we'll move that view down to here and
like<00:04:03.340> that<00:04:03.600> you<00:04:04.600> now<00:04:04.750> have<00:04:04.780> everything<00:04:05.500> in

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
like that you now have everything in

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.050 
like that you now have everything in
here<00:04:05.740> that<00:04:05.890> you<00:04:06.010> need<00:04:06.300> ready<00:04:07.300> to<00:04:07.450> manufacture
