00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:08.240
 hello today we are going to learn to do the 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.550
 famous mark cake which are some biscuits 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.750
 very fast in less than five minutes 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:16.510
 that are made in a microwave-safe cup 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.790
 let's make it chocolate flavor and the 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:22.420
 ingredients we need are sugar 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:26.619
 butter yeast milk that already 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:30.580
 we have melted an egg flour cocoa 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:33.620
 in powder and utensils the cup one 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:37.790
 spoon and a fork 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:41.559
 to the beaten butter we're going to throw 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.559
 an egg that we have previously beaten 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.410
 two tablespoons of milk 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:56.149
 so we take the spoon as a measure and 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:59.120
 we beat when mixed we add 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.430
 a spoonful of sugar I use the 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.399
 brown because it's the one I like if I 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.230
 The manson and gary addis very sweet 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:08.210
 much 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:11.270
 we add as the tip of a 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.300
 teaspoon of yeast and the sieve masters 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.200
 so that it is more spongy we have to 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.250
 throw 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.250
 three tablespoons 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:29.090
 good 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.090
 I'm missing another that only half 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.520
 and the sieve masters 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.979
 we have mixed with flour and 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:44.810
 yeast is thicker and we add 3 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:47.500
 scoops come falling 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.500
 and good 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:55.450
 and we have ready the mass and 

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:55.450
 we throw in our cup 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.859
 we have to put the hunt now at 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:05.530
 microwave at full power during 

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:07.780
 two minutes then we painted it if we see 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.370
 which is not because it depends on each micro 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.500
 more we put another minute 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.900
 we already have our cake we have 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.450
 adorned to make it look more beautiful and 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.159
 two minutes and we can taste it if you 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.810
