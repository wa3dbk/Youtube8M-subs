00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
team it's gonna be a hybrid today unlike

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.180 
team it's gonna be a hybrid today unlike
the<00:00:15.240> other<00:00:15.719> two<00:00:16.020> that<00:00:16.320> I've<00:00:16.410> done<00:00:16.529> so<00:00:16.770> far<00:00:16.800> be

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
the other two that I've done so far be

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.650 
the other two that I've done so far be
nationality<00:00:17.789> so<00:00:18.000> it's<00:00:18.210> going<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.359> be<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.480> little

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
nationality so it's going to be a little

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.960 
nationality so it's going to be a little
bit<00:00:18.779> different<00:00:19.160> one<00:00:20.160> thing<00:00:20.340> before<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:20.670> start

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
bit different one thing before I start

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.200 
bit different one thing before I start
is<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.390> made<00:00:22.230> this<00:00:22.500> recording<00:00:23.430> when<00:00:23.789> I<00:00:23.820> did<00:00:24.090> it

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
is I made this recording when I did it

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.179 
is I made this recording when I did it
like<00:00:24.539> live<00:00:24.840> commentary<00:00:25.439> whilst<00:00:25.740> put<00:00:25.949> them<00:00:26.070> in

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
like live commentary whilst put them in

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.609 
like live commentary whilst put them in
and<00:00:26.449> I've<00:00:27.449> lost<00:00:27.660> that<00:00:27.869> commentary<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.529> was

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
and I've lost that commentary it was

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.500 
and I've lost that commentary it was
done<00:00:28.769> about<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:29.010> month<00:00:29.220> ago<00:00:29.369> so<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.090> price<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.330> a

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
done about a month ago so the price is a

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.849 
done about a month ago so the price is a
little<00:00:30.599> bit<00:00:30.900> different<00:00:31.170> as<00:00:31.260> well<00:00:31.410> so<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.590> can't

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
little bit different as well so I can't

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.319 
little bit different as well so I can't
really<00:00:31.980> put<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.250> price<00:00:32.309> on<00:00:32.669> how<00:00:32.790> much<00:00:32.969> this<00:00:33.090> team

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
really put a price on how much this team

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.020 
really put a price on how much this team
is<00:00:33.510> worth<00:00:33.829> exactly<00:00:34.829> but<00:00:35.370> I'm<00:00:35.820> guessing

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
is worth exactly but I'm guessing

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.319 
is worth exactly but I'm guessing
somewhere<00:00:36.510> between<00:00:36.690> 100<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.800> maybe<00:00:38.040> 120<00:00:38.790> may

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
somewhere between 100 and maybe 120 may

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.430 
somewhere between 100 and maybe 120 may
be<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.480> little<00:00:39.570> bit<00:00:39.750> more<00:00:39.899> maybe<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.200> little<00:00:40.290> bit

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
be a little bit more maybe a little bit

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.380 
be a little bit more maybe a little bit
less<00:00:40.590> depending<00:00:41.040> on<00:00:41.160> what<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.640> console<00:00:42.239> you're

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
less depending on what a console you're

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.720 
less depending on what a console you're
on<00:00:42.480> etc<00:00:43.350> by<00:00:43.530> what<00:00:44.160> it's<00:00:44.280> going<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.460> be<00:00:44.520> it's

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
on etc by what it's going to be it's

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.270 
on etc by what it's going to be it's
going<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:45.000> be<00:00:45.059> like<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.980> mixture<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.070> quite<00:00:47.250> a

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
going to be like a mixture of quite a

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.830 
going to be like a mixture of quite a

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
them green chemistry lines which is good

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.670 
them green chemistry lines which is good
and<00:04:35.949> then<00:04:36.370> if<00:04:36.490> we<00:04:36.610> swap<00:04:36.879> that<00:04:37.090> around<00:04:37.620> so<00:04:38.620> I'm
