amazing amazing
that<00:01:32.640> was<00:01:33.240> almost<00:01:33.479> too<00:01:34.020> perfect

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.910 

the<00:01:37.520> next<00:01:37.759> one<00:01:37.909> up<00:01:38.060> is<00:01:38.180> the<00:01:38.360> 12th<00:01:38.780> fret<00:01:39.020> usually

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
the next one up is the 12th fret usually

marked with a double dot the 12th fret
is<00:01:42.560> special<00:01:43.039> because<00:01:43.280> notes<00:01:43.759> 12<00:01:44.210> frets<00:01:44.509> apart

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
is special because notes 12 frets apart

is special because notes 12 frets apart
are<00:01:45.259> what<00:01:45.500> we<00:01:45.619> call<00:01:45.799> an<00:01:45.920> octave<00:01:46.429> higher<00:01:46.789> that

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
are what we call an octave higher that

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.539 
are what we call an octave higher that
means<00:01:47.659> it's<00:01:48.049> the<00:01:48.110> same<00:01:48.469> note<00:01:48.799> just<00:01:49.399> at<00:01:49.520> a

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549

higher pitch same thing with a 3rd and
15th<00:01:53.840> frets<00:01:54.200> 12<00:01:55.159> frets<00:01:55.429> apart<00:01:55.579> so<00:01:56.240> it's

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
15th frets 12 frets apart so it's

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:59.440
