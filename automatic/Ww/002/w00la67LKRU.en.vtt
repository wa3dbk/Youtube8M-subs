00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 after watching this video, I advise 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.839
 you look into the game store 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.700
 you play a huge amount of store 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.280
 discounts and special offers 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.059
 as well as a large selection and everyone will find 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.139
 something to taste so start 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.820
 Hello dear minecrafters and 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.590
 hello to all subscribers with you valera 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.800
 gangrene today i want to show how 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.630
 install x-ray on minecraft 1.6.4 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.490
 so let's start what we need to do 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.070
 it's pretty much just much 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.340
 simpler than version 1.5.2 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.809
 we can also find the root folder of the game 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:40.410
 through the start in the search we write a percentage and 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:43.680
 date date is on windows 7 so 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.870
 works but now we will be working with 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.750
 windows 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.960
 7-8 and also with windows xp so run 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.000
 launcher who will link under the video 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.210
 download this launcher install it 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.520
 and then absolutely everything from the very first 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.899
 version up to version 1.5 7.2 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.729
 hacked ie every version 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.409
 minecraft here also hacked you 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.409
 can install ford dzharty files 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:14.820
 clearly you can not water in this client 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.830
 to the client and this is exactly the version they are without 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.750
 mods they just go as you versions 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.850
 then you can put them on but 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.420
 I personally do not like this 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.430
 some fashion and so here we have downloaded our 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.170
 client yes without a client we will fail 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.000
 put them in the middle of this x-ray 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.740
 especially for this client he hangs up 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.159
 very small but very comfortable 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.729
 specifically for minecraft 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:41.820
 click select version 1.6.4 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.990
 and then it will be written to install 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.799
 settable 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.470
 we go now at my idea x-ray 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.210
 worth it but with you I will remove it 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.070
 and then install again show that he 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.840
 it works so when we install x-ray 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.840
 we are not writing a version 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.920
 avila bu how correctly and that means then 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.500
 that he stopped 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.479
 so he earned himself x-ray which 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.409
 will show us precious ore 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.599
 Press the x key English x to 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.150
 show more accurate coordinates we 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:14.819
 press the c key or with Russian 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.900
 so that we always have light doesn't matter 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:22.010
 while we are together in a cave or the night when 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:26.069
 click on the hell key but I have 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:28.340
 I do not know why the idea should be 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.140
 be dark 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:35.310
 okay in general when it is dark you 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.350
 press the l key English and all 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:44.250
 around it becomes as if now 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:46.610
 yes and so out of the game update 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.610
 customer 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.230
 so update went successfully go to 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:11.200
 our world go into the world and we have x-terra 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.489
 there is nothing registered in the chat and if 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.950
 i will click on x or on 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.290
 nothing happens we go out in general and 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.200
 our minecraft and yes now there are 2 more 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:23.170
 ways these ways can work 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.690
 on windows 8 on windows 7 on windows xp 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.510
 On each version, click the settings 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.030
 resource packs from when the package folder 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:35.500
 resources well here from now here 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:38.110
 our micro valya everything is very easy also in 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.340
 client we can when we run 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.739
 customer we can click on this one 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:46.000
 daddy click on daddy on 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:48.069
 hiding. maykravt but I think thats 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.060
 this way of transition will be much 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:53.590
 harder and longer and more unpleasant yes here we are 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.060
 we can just click these on the launcher 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.579
 daddy and everything is ready so now 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.829
 let's start installing minecraft more precisely 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.569
 x-ray click go here we went to 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.650

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:04.510

 winrar mention the more different it is guilty 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.639

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:40.150

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:42.669

 unzip to folder or desktop 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:55.840
 here are these files and then only 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:58.570
 throw in the daddy one in the archive 1.6.4 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.400

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.580
 archive 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:06.270

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.979

 Valya x3 installed go in the game on 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:21.360

 guys 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:31.919
 4 in on servers as if honestly for 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.990
 administration is a bit useful too 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:37.620
 because you can find mechanisms 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:40.410
 so that your server does not get littered so 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.240
 I think there will be a lot of positive feedback 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.669

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.250
