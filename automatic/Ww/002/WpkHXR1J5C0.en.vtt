00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:03.739
 and the elect already affect people 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:17.519
 anyone who has played a little bit besides beats knows of 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:19.269
 some games are violent 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:22.880
 some are even the use of violence as the main characteristic that is 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.759
 but did these games end up encouraging violence 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:31.609
 in the players one of the first games to be a cause of mass concern was 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:34.780
 the roast disrespect in 1936 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.340
 to the knowledge of our time 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.260
 The goal was to drive a car to run over the checkered monsters game 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.339
 ended up generating organized protests 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:47.510
 inspired the first laws to control electronic games many years 

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:51.619
 have passed, but according to the detainees by means of more realistic 

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:54.080
 pressure was increasing again 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.510
 and it was not just violence some games portrayed torture of discrimination 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.590
 This was enough to create a discussion that lasts even 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.590
 to give origin even in scientific research 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.790
 I say that the surveys said 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.800
 many studies have already been done to understand the relationship in three games 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.980
 and the aggressive behavior of the players, not to mention the 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.180
 to the press and the population 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.050
 sometimes the media draws attention to the fact that many 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.470
 people who have committed violent crimes like video games 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.490
 but statistically speaking 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.270
 This is the same as saying that people who commit violent crimes have a 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.520
 cell phone 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.240
 why today but 70% of the population of the United States is Jorge and 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.470
 games not only criminals and violent people but also contained them 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.900
 the gains of volvo ocean race and one of the expelled ones verified that the relation 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.640
 it is the opposite of the child or adolescent who does not play videogame the other factors of 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.230
 to develop aggressive behavior 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.540
 before the invention of the television of the cinema the humans mainly 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.760
 men were more violent with the popularization of the stade reims inclusive 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.190
 we are cruel 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.190
 juvenile crime rates fell further the vast majority of 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.180
 research points to the innocence of video games in relation to violence 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.489
 but it's no use many people still worry about it 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.340
 videogames are no problem, we know very well what the factors are. 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.120
 for a child to become an adult and the bed 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.239
 poor parents also who took them out structured power that is why 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.980
 before we attack with balls we need to define the children
