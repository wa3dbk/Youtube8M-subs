00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:19.019 
the end of the yarn in your hand as you

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.169 
the end of the yarn in your hand as you
wrap<00:00:19.499> around<00:00:19.529> once<00:00:20.159> we<00:00:20.519> have<00:00:20.669> enough<00:00:20.880> wraps

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:21.179 
wrap around once we have enough wraps

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:23.689 
wrap around once we have enough wraps
you'll<00:00:21.539> be<00:00:21.689> able<00:00:21.749> to<00:00:21.989> talk<00:00:22.169> this<00:00:22.349> end<00:00:22.589> in<00:00:22.949> and

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
you'll be able to talk this end in and

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.630 
you'll be able to talk this end in and
you<00:00:24.329> always<00:00:24.599> want<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:24.929> wrap<00:00:25.199> yarn<00:00:25.890> around<00:00:26.099> the

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
you always want to wrap yarn around the

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.659 
you always want to wrap yarn around the
outside<00:00:27.390> of<00:00:27.749> either<00:00:28.050> end

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:28.669 
outside of either end

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:31.089 
outside of either end
so<00:00:29.669> we're<00:00:29.759> going<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:29.909> start<00:00:30.089> by<00:00:30.239> going<00:00:30.390> under

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
so we're going to start by going under

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:37.130 
so we're going to start by going under
the<00:00:32.099> back<00:00:32.719> up<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:34.289> over<00:00:35.600> spit<00:00:36.600> on<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.840> front

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
the back up and over spit on the front

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.729 
the back up and over spit on the front
and<00:00:37.969> then<00:00:39.230> over<00:00:40.550> the<00:00:41.550> back<00:00:41.789> and<00:00:42.149> around<00:00:42.809> to

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
and then over the back and around to

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.630 
and then over the back and around to
start<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:45.710> so<00:00:46.710> each<00:00:46.949> time<00:00:46.980> we're<00:00:47.280> wrapping

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
start and so each time we're wrapping

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.220 
start and so each time we're wrapping
the<00:00:47.760> yarn<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:48.000> always<00:00:48.239> being<00:00:48.420> wrapped<00:00:48.719> around

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
the yarn is always being wrapped around

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.829 
the yarn is always being wrapped around
the<00:00:49.739> outside<00:00:49.769> of<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.399> edge<00:00:50.660> so<00:00:51.660> we're<00:00:51.750> going

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:51.839 
the outside of the edge so we're going

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:55.459 
the outside of the edge so we're going
to<00:00:51.899> go<00:00:52.019> under<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.769> back<00:00:53.070> up<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.780> over<00:00:55.350> the

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
to go under the back up and over the

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.560 
to go under the back up and over the
front<00:00:56.149> over<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.570> under<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.140> back<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:59.570> over

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
front over and under the back and over

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:08.170 
front over and under the back and over
the<00:01:01.140> bottom<00:01:01.499> of<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.800> front<00:01:02.300> so<00:01:03.300> under<00:01:05.240> over

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
the bottom of the front so under over

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.180 
the bottom of the front so under over
over<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.480> around<00:01:10.470> I'm<00:01:10.860> going<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.070> show

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
over and around I'm going to show

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.480 
over and around I'm going to show
another<00:01:11.460> time<00:01:11.760> from<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.000> beginning<00:01:12.650> go<00:01:13.650> under

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
another time from the beginning go under

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.850 
another time from the beginning go under
and<00:01:15.450> around<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:16.170> up<00:01:16.830> so<00:01:17.760> we've<00:01:17.850> done<00:01:18.060> half<00:01:18.860> and

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
and around and up so we've done half and

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.110 
and around and up so we've done half and
down<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.310> under<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.440> back<00:01:22.440> around<00:01:23.000> at<00:01:24.000> our

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
down and under and back around at our

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.750 
down and under and back around at our
beginning<00:01:26.180> you'll<00:01:27.180> get<00:01:27.390> faster<00:01:27.660> at<00:01:28.110> this<00:01:28.760> and

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
beginning you'll get faster at this and

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.190 
beginning you'll get faster at this and
you'll<00:01:29.940> find<00:01:30.330> a<00:01:32.270> rhythm<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.510> works<00:01:33.720> best<00:01:34.020> for

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
you'll find a rhythm that works best for

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:46.039 
you'll find a rhythm that works best for
you<00:01:39.770> see<00:01:40.770> if<00:01:40.920> this<00:01:41.160> angle<00:01:41.370> hopes

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.139 

under<00:01:49.890> if<00:01:50.890> you<00:01:50.979> think<00:01:51.130> about<00:01:51.250> it<00:01:51.399> under<00:01:51.700> and

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
under if you think about it under and

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:55.440 
under if you think about it under and
over<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:52.659> front<00:01:52.960> I'm<00:01:53.259> going<00:01:54.009> back<00:01:54.340> over<00:01:55.149> the

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
over the front I'm going back over the

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.429 
over the front I'm going back over the
front<00:01:55.979> do<00:01:56.979> the<00:01:57.100> back<00:01:57.280> over<00:01:57.579> the<00:01:58.000> front<00:01:58.439> back

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
front do the back over the front back

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:04.830 
front do the back over the front back
and<00:01:59.950> over<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:00.369> front<00:02:03.000> but<00:02:04.000> the<00:02:04.299> important

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
and over the front but the important

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.639 
and over the front but the important
thing<00:02:05.170> is<00:02:06.159> that<00:02:07.090> you<00:02:07.450> are<00:02:07.479> always<00:02:07.840> twisting

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
thing is that you are always twisting

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.680 
thing is that you are always twisting
the<00:02:08.769> yarn<00:02:08.950> around<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:09.519> outside<00:02:10.060> and<00:02:10.420> it's

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
the yarn around the outside and it's

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.470 
the yarn around the outside and it's
that<00:02:10.899> first<00:02:11.170> loop<00:02:11.560> that<00:02:12.519> is<00:02:12.849> only<00:02:13.209> a<00:02:13.239> little

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
that first loop that is only a little

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:22.220 
that first loop that is only a little
bit<00:02:13.720> tricky<00:02:14.760> so<00:02:15.760> you<00:02:15.819> can<00:02:16.060> kind<00:02:16.269> of<00:02:16.300> go<00:02:16.420> around

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.570 

yarn<00:02:43.290> around<00:02:45.680> until<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:46.770> have<00:02:46.800> a<00:02:46.920> scheme<00:02:47.340> that

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
yarn around until you have a scheme that
