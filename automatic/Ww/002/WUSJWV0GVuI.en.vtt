00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.950 

so<00:00:18.730> you<00:00:18.789> can<00:00:18.939> see<00:00:19.090> that<00:00:19.119> gives<00:00:19.539> me<00:00:19.689> quite<00:00:19.930> a

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960 
so you can see that gives me quite a

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.100 
so you can see that gives me quite a
little<00:00:20.230> range<00:00:20.560> of<00:00:20.800> motion<00:00:21.189> here<00:00:21.400> now<00:00:22.110> even

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.110 
little range of motion here now even

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.140 
little range of motion here now even
better<00:00:23.259> than<00:00:23.680> if<00:00:24.070> you<00:00:24.340> see<00:00:24.550> my<00:00:24.759> other<00:00:24.820> video

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150 
better than if you see my other video

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.230 
better than if you see my other video
with<00:00:25.540> the<00:00:25.720> lever<00:00:26.140> system<00:00:26.669> that<00:00:27.669> works<00:00:27.880> okay

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
with the lever system that works okay

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.470 
with the lever system that works okay
and<00:00:28.480> I<00:00:28.900> may<00:00:29.080> still<00:00:29.349> use<00:00:29.380> that<00:00:29.650> but<00:00:30.210> just<00:00:31.210> trying

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
and I may still use that but just trying

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.990 
and I may still use that but just trying
to<00:00:31.570> come<00:00:31.720> up<00:00:31.779> with<00:00:31.840> a<00:00:32.020> little<00:00:32.259> bit<00:00:32.820> simpler<00:00:33.820> way

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
to come up with a little bit simpler way

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.750 
to come up with a little bit simpler way
in<00:00:34.210> a<00:00:34.300> little<00:00:34.420> more<00:00:34.660> compact<00:00:35.290> way<00:00:35.559> I<00:00:35.860> came<00:00:36.399> up

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
in a little more compact way I came up

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.490 
in a little more compact way I came up
with<00:00:36.790> this<00:00:37.059> simple<00:00:37.360> slide<00:00:37.809> mechanism<00:00:38.050> so

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
with this simple slide mechanism so

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.740 
with this simple slide mechanism so
it'll<00:00:38.739> still<00:00:38.920> use<00:00:39.070> the<00:00:39.219> same<00:00:39.399> principle<00:00:39.750> it'll

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
it'll still use the same principle it'll

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.080 
it'll still use the same principle it'll
this<00:00:41.050> will<00:00:41.200> still<00:00:41.440> be<00:00:41.590> a<00:00:41.890> box<00:00:42.370> inside<00:00:42.640> of<00:00:42.880> a<00:00:42.940> box

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
this will still be a box inside of a box

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.930 
this will still be a box inside of a box
so<00:00:43.300> we'll<00:00:43.480> just<00:00:43.510> pretend<00:00:43.809> that<00:00:44.140> this<00:00:44.760> table<00:00:45.760> is

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
so we'll just pretend that this table is

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.760 
so we'll just pretend that this table is
one<00:00:46.180> plane<00:00:46.480> and<00:00:46.720> then<00:00:46.900> there<00:00:47.080> be<00:00:47.230> obviously<00:00:47.680> a

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
one plane and then there be obviously a

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.280 
one plane and then there be obviously a
it<00:00:48.160> would<00:00:48.280> be<00:00:48.430> a<00:00:48.460> box<00:00:49.090> is<00:00:49.420> what<00:00:49.720> this<00:00:49.930> would<00:00:50.110> set

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
it would be a box is what this would set

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.750 
it would be a box is what this would set
in<00:00:50.470> so<00:00:50.650> this<00:00:50.800> would<00:00:50.980> still<00:00:51.190> slide<00:00:51.460> back<00:00:51.730> and

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
in so this would still slide back and

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.990 
in so this would still slide back and
forth<00:00:52.000> inside<00:00:52.690> of<00:00:52.870> a<00:00:52.930> box<00:00:53.110> and<00:00:53.410> then<00:00:54.190> it<00:00:54.790> would

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
forth inside of a box and then it would

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.750 
forth inside of a box and then it would
simply<00:00:55.390> slide<00:00:55.630> back<00:00:55.900> and<00:00:55.930> forth<00:00:56.170> on<00:00:56.560> a<00:00:56.980> little

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
simply slide back and forth on a little

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.160 
simply slide back and forth on a little
piece<00:00:58.000> that<00:00:58.240> would<00:00:58.390> run<00:00:58.540> in<00:00:58.720> the<00:00:58.810> middle<00:00:59.020> on<00:00:59.140> a

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
piece that would run in the middle on a

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.500 
piece that would run in the middle on a
couple<00:00:59.530> of<00:00:59.680> pivots<00:01:00.640> and<00:01:00.760> then<00:01:01.060> it's<00:01:01.239> not<00:01:01.390> going

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
couple of pivots and then it's not going

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.240 
couple of pivots and then it's not going
to<00:01:01.600> have<00:01:01.750> to<00:01:01.900> be<00:01:02.020> so<00:01:02.380> deadly<00:01:02.620> accurate<00:01:03.130> because

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
to have to be so deadly accurate because

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.740 
to have to be so deadly accurate because
it's<00:01:03.460> going<00:01:03.550> to<00:01:03.610> lay<00:01:03.790> why<00:01:04.299> it<00:01:04.360> against<00:01:04.629> the

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
it's going to lay why it against the

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.109 
it's going to lay why it against the
side<00:01:04.960> of<00:01:04.989> the<00:01:05.140> box<00:01:05.290> so<00:01:05.680> then<00:01:06.610> I<00:01:06.640> just<00:01:06.729> have<00:01:07.090> to

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
side of the box so then I just have to

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:09.990 
side of the box so then I just have to
spring<00:01:07.600> load<00:01:07.840> this<00:01:08.740> mechanism<00:01:09.310> so<00:01:09.640> that<00:01:09.670> it

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
spring load this mechanism so that it

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.730 
spring load this mechanism so that it
was<00:01:10.180> spring<00:01:10.540> loaded<00:01:10.750> to<00:01:10.960> go<00:01:11.049> up<00:01:11.170> and<00:01:11.320> down<00:01:11.470> and

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
was spring loaded to go up and down and

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.160 
was spring loaded to go up and down and
this<00:01:11.860> gives<00:01:12.100> me<00:01:12.250> a<00:01:12.340> real<00:01:12.729> big<00:01:13.119> range<00:01:13.540> of<00:01:13.780> motion

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
this gives me a real big range of motion

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.450 
this gives me a real big range of motion
as<00:01:14.259> you<00:01:14.380> can<00:01:14.530> see<00:01:14.680> if<00:01:14.799> I<00:01:14.860> put<00:01:15.070> my<00:01:15.100> tape<00:01:15.430> measure

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
as you can see if I put my tape measure

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.959 
as you can see if I put my tape measure
here<00:01:16.079> it<00:01:17.079> gives<00:01:17.320> me<00:01:17.470> a<00:01:17.500> huge<00:01:17.860> range<00:01:18.340> of<00:01:18.549> motion

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:18.969 
here it gives me a huge range of motion

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:22.410 
here it gives me a huge range of motion
I<00:01:19.960> should<00:01:20.380> be<00:01:20.499> able<00:01:20.590> to<00:01:20.740> cover<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:22.090> know<00:01:22.210> like

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
I should be able to cover you know like

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.160 
I should be able to cover you know like
a<00:01:22.450> 65<00:01:23.079> 14<00:01:24.069> or<00:01:24.219> something<00:01:24.369> so<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.810> that's<00:01:26.020> what<00:01:26.139> I

and<00:01:42.429> that'll<00:01:42.759> tell<00:01:42.909> me<00:01:43.060> how<00:01:43.389> big<00:01:43.539> I<00:01:43.689> got<00:01:43.840> to

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:43.929 
and that'll tell me how big I got to

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:45.809 
and that'll tell me how big I got to
make<00:01:44.020> it<00:01:44.079> so<00:01:44.409> hopefully<00:01:45.039> you<00:01:45.310> guys<00:01:45.399> are<00:01:45.609> having

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929 
fun watching hopefully you'll keep

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:48.959 
fun watching hopefully you'll keep
tuning<00:01:47.229> in<00:01:47.380> and<00:01:47.529> we'll<00:01:48.369> see<00:01:48.490> if<00:01:48.520> we<00:01:48.639> can't<00:01:48.850> get

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:48.969 
tuning in and we'll see if we can't get

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:50.340 
tuning in and we'll see if we can't get
this<00:01:49.029> together<00:01:49.329> for<00:01:49.689> use<00:01:49.869> here<00:01:50.049> in<00:01:50.139> the<00:01:50.229> next

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
this together for use here in the next

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.929 
this together for use here in the next
little<00:01:50.499> while<00:01:50.649> I'm<00:01:50.920> corner<00:01:51.189> just<00:01:51.729> got<00:01:51.909> a

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
little while I'm corner just got a
