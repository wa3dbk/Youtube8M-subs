00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
scissors which is also pretty essential

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.109 
scissors which is also pretty essential
when<00:02:06.780> you're<00:02:06.810> cutting<00:02:07.340> you're<00:02:08.340> going<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.879> I

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
when you're cutting you're going to I

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.839 
when you're cutting you're going to I
place<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.810> loops<00:02:10.020> down<00:02:10.319> in<00:02:10.590> so<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.370> formed

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
place the loops down in so it formed

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.809 
place the loops down in so it formed
like<00:02:11.970> an<00:02:12.090> X

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
like an X

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.050 
like an X
then<00:02:13.060> first<00:02:13.810> loop<00:02:14.109> goes<00:02:14.409> in<00:02:14.650> use<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:15.609> ruler<00:02:16.030> to

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
then first loop goes in use the ruler to

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.860 
then first loop goes in use the ruler to
kind<00:02:16.599> of<00:02:16.689> Center<00:02:17.139> a<00:02:17.459> second<00:02:18.459> loop<00:02:18.730> so<00:02:19.689> there's

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
kind of Center a second loop so there's

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.420 
kind of Center a second loop so there's
your<00:02:20.019> first<00:02:20.079> bow<00:02:21.180> then<00:02:22.180> you're<00:02:22.329> gonna<00:02:22.420> add<00:02:23.430> the

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
your first bow then you're gonna add the

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.699 
your first bow then you're gonna add the
ribbon<00:02:24.670> sprays<00:02:25.209> which<00:02:26.019> again

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
ribbon sprays which again

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.220 
ribbon sprays which again
four<00:02:27.010> inches<00:02:27.340> long<00:02:27.579> I<00:02:27.909> cut<00:02:28.299> them<00:02:28.510> at<00:02:28.659> an<00:02:28.689> angle

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
four inches long I cut them at an angle

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:36.000 
four inches long I cut them at an angle
and<00:02:29.609> heat<00:02:30.609> seal<00:02:30.909> the<00:02:31.120> ends<00:02:34.139> those<00:02:35.139> go<00:02:35.439> down<00:02:35.680> and

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
and heat seal the ends those go down and

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.929 
and heat seal the ends those go down and
now<00:02:37.019> next<00:02:38.019> you're<00:02:38.409> going<00:02:38.620> to<00:02:38.799> use<00:02:39.129> your<00:02:39.370> 28

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:39.939 
now next you're going to use your 28

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:42.629 
now next you're going to use your 28
inches<00:02:40.359> of<00:02:40.659> ribbon<00:02:40.900> fold<00:02:41.709> it<00:02:41.919> in<00:02:42.010> half<00:02:42.040> to<00:02:42.249> find

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:42.639 
inches of ribbon fold it in half to find

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:45.240 
inches of ribbon fold it in half to find
your<00:02:42.819> Center<00:02:43.299> it<00:02:44.230> goes<00:02:44.409> down<00:02:44.650> into<00:02:44.859> the<00:02:45.010> mini

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
your Center it goes down into the mini

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.899 
your Center it goes down into the mini
bowdabra<00:02:45.459> and<00:02:46.090> use<00:02:46.569> the<00:02:46.840> ruler<00:02:47.730> you're<00:02:48.730> gonna

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:48.909 
bowdabra and use the ruler you're gonna

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:52.170 
bowdabra and use the ruler you're gonna
make<00:02:49.329> the<00:02:49.510> loops<00:02:49.750> at<00:02:49.989> the<00:02:50.019> two<00:02:50.439> inch<00:02:50.650> mark<00:02:51.180> some

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
make the loops at the two inch mark some

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.789 
make the loops at the two inch mark some
one<00:02:52.389> on<00:02:52.419> one<00:02:52.540> side<00:02:55.079> actually<00:02:56.079> this<00:02:56.469> should<00:02:56.530> go

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
one on one side actually this should go

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.849 
one on one side actually this should go
down<00:02:57.069> so<00:02:57.430> have<00:02:57.730> it<00:02:57.879> face<00:02:58.120> towards<00:02:58.569> you<00:02:58.859> and

00:02:59.849 --> 00:02:59.859 
down so have it face towards you and

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:07.170 
down so have it face towards you and
this<00:03:00.189> one<00:03:00.549> here<00:03:05.129> another<00:03:06.129> loop<00:03:06.639> at<00:03:06.849> the<00:03:06.879> two

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
this one here another loop at the two

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.679 
this one here another loop at the two
inch<00:03:07.329> mark

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:09.689 
inch mark

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:12.929 
inch mark
final<00:03:10.689> loop<00:03:10.930> use<00:03:11.650> your<00:03:11.829> one<00:03:12.099> to<00:03:12.819> hold

final loop use your one to hold

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:15.839 
final loop use your one to hold
everything<00:03:13.269> down<00:03:13.919> and<00:03:14.919> then<00:03:15.040> make<00:03:15.489> sure<00:03:15.519> your

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
everything down and then make sure your

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.890 
everything down and then make sure your
loops<00:03:16.180> are<00:03:16.419> even<00:03:17.879> and<00:03:18.879> you<00:03:19.000> have<00:03:19.150> the<00:03:19.299> tails<00:03:19.599> of

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
loops are even and you have the tails of

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.809 
loops are even and you have the tails of
the<00:03:19.930> bow<00:03:20.169> hanging<00:03:20.620> down<00:03:20.799> you<00:03:21.129> can<00:03:21.459> scrunch

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
the bow hanging down you can scrunch

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.699 
the bow hanging down you can scrunch
down<00:03:21.939> here<00:03:23.129> next<00:03:24.129> this<00:03:24.489> ribbon<00:03:24.909> is<00:03:25.500> 15<00:03:26.500> inches

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
down here next this ribbon is 15 inches

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.640 
down here next this ribbon is 15 inches
long<00:03:27.069> I've<00:03:27.310> dovetailed<00:03:28.030> one<00:03:28.509> end<00:03:28.870> to<00:03:29.199> the

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
long I've dovetailed one end to the

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:30.990 
long I've dovetailed one end to the
other<00:03:29.799> end<00:03:30.040> it<00:03:30.310> doesn't<00:03:30.639> matter<00:03:30.819> because

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
other end it doesn't matter because

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.580 
other end it doesn't matter because
that's<00:03:31.180> gonna<00:03:31.389> go<00:03:31.750> into<00:03:32.109> the<00:03:32.199> mini<00:03:32.439> bowdabra

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
that's gonna go into the mini bowdabra

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.819 
that's gonna go into the mini bowdabra
so<00:03:33.519> you<00:03:33.609> start<00:03:33.909> with<00:03:33.970> this<00:03:34.299> end<00:03:34.629> and<00:03:35.379> these<00:03:35.650> are

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
so you start with this end and these are

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.929 
so you start with this end and these are
just<00:03:35.979> small<00:03:36.250> little<00:03:36.879> loops<00:03:37.409> around<00:03:38.409> like<00:03:38.939> the

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:39.939 
just small little loops around like the

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:44.789 
just small little loops around like the
one<00:03:40.209> and<00:03:40.389> a<00:03:40.479> quarter<00:03:41.049> inch<00:03:42.040> mark<00:03:43.259> go<00:03:44.259> back<00:03:44.500> and

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
one and a quarter inch mark go back and

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:51.330 
one and a quarter inch mark go back and
forth<00:03:46.139> on<00:03:47.139> this<00:03:47.470> side<00:03:49.439> finish<00:03:50.439> on<00:03:50.680> this<00:03:50.949> side

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
forth on this side finish on this side

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.879 
forth on this side finish on this side
hold<00:03:51.909> it<00:03:52.030> down<00:03:52.209> and<00:03:52.479> put<00:03:52.659> your<00:03:52.780> line<00:03:53.079> in<00:03:55.889> and

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:56.889 
hold it down and put your line in and

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:58.499 
hold it down and put your line in and
then<00:03:57.129> the<00:03:57.489> way<00:03:57.579> this<00:03:57.729> is<00:03:57.939> cut<00:03:58.150> with<00:03:58.359> the

00:03:58.499 --> 00:03:58.509 
then the way this is cut with the

00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:00.959 
then the way this is cut with the
dovetail<00:03:59.319> you<00:03:59.919> have<00:04:00.040> a<00:04:00.069> little<00:04:00.400> bit<00:04:00.519> sticking

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:00.969 
dovetail you have a little bit sticking

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:03.539 
dovetail you have a little bit sticking
out<00:04:01.120> so<00:04:01.509> you<00:04:02.379> have<00:04:02.469> four<00:04:02.769> loops<00:04:03.099> and<00:04:03.400> then<00:04:03.489> the

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
out so you have four loops and then the

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:05.999 
out so you have four loops and then the
little<00:04:04.000> dove<00:04:04.209> tail<00:04:04.479> at<00:04:04.659> the<00:04:04.750> end<00:04:04.919> scrunch<00:04:05.919> down

00:04:05.999 --> 00:04:06.009 
little dove tail at the end scrunch down

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:09.089 
little dove tail at the end scrunch down
make<00:04:06.519> sure<00:04:06.729> the<00:04:06.909> bow<00:04:07.060> is<00:04:07.180> in<00:04:07.389> there<00:04:08.009> nice<00:04:09.009> and

bring the wire around to tie it in the

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.530 
bring the wire around to tie it in the
back<00:04:35.169> it's<00:04:35.950> really<00:04:36.460> important<00:04:37.000> that<00:04:37.090> you<00:04:37.270> tie

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
back it's really important that you tie

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.690 
back it's really important that you tie
the<00:04:37.600> wire<00:04:37.960> in<00:04:38.230> the<00:04:38.320> center<00:04:38.370> she<00:04:39.370> gonna<00:04:39.460> have<00:04:39.610> to

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
the wire in the center she gonna have to
