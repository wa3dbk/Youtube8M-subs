your<00:00:46.570> typical<00:00:46.690> high<00:00:47.079> performance<00:00:47.649> cap<00:00:47.890> we

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
your typical high performance cap we

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.090 
your typical high performance cap we
have<00:00:48.969> some<00:00:49.179> final<00:00:49.570> over<00:00:49.749> here<00:00:49.960> the<00:00:50.109> kids<00:00:50.350> as

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
have some final over here the kids as

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.180 
have some final over here the kids as
well<00:00:51.339> as<00:00:51.489> the<00:00:51.609> coaches<00:00:52.030> and<00:00:52.499> it's<00:00:53.499> just<00:00:53.679> a<00:00:53.829> just

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
well as the coaches and it's just a just

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.870

a<00:00:54.280> great<00:00:54.429> experience<00:00:54.519> all<00:00:55.030> round

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:57.880 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.850 

I<00:00:57.970> think<00:00:58.480> the<00:00:58.900> camp<00:00:59.110> is<00:00:59.260> still<00:00:59.440> great<00:00:59.620> because

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
I think the camp is still great because

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.040 
I think the camp is still great because
it<00:00:59.980> really<00:01:00.130> treats<00:01:00.790> the<00:01:01.510> girls<00:01:01.780> and<00:01:01.960> the<00:01:02.020> boys

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
it really treats the girls and the boys

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.410 
it really treats the girls and the boys
like<00:01:02.470> equals<00:01:02.920> and<00:01:03.190> it's<00:01:03.850> a<00:01:03.910> great<00:01:04.150> opportunity

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
like equals and it's a great opportunity

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.480 
like equals and it's a great opportunity
for<00:01:04.780> girls<00:01:05.110> to<00:01:05.290> get<00:01:05.440> high<00:01:05.740> level<00:01:06.100> low<00:01:06.250> gene

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
for girls to get high level low gene

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.730 
for girls to get high level low gene
which<00:01:07.270> is<00:01:07.420> something<00:01:07.780> that<00:01:07.930> they<00:01:08.560> don't

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
which is something that they don't

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.610 
which is something that they don't
necessarily<00:01:08.950> always<00:01:09.460> get<00:01:09.970> and<00:01:10.270> you<00:01:10.810> know<00:01:10.930> yeah

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 
necessarily always get and you know yeah

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.670 
necessarily always get and you know yeah
I<00:01:11.950> think<00:01:12.790> that<00:01:13.060> part<00:01:13.240> of<00:01:13.270> the<00:01:13.360> reason<00:01:13.390> this<00:01:13.810> the

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
I think that part of the reason this the

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.170 
I think that part of the reason this the
hockey<00:01:15.070> team<00:01:15.250> was<00:01:15.400> so<00:01:15.550> incredibly<00:01:15.880> successful

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
hockey team was so incredibly successful

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.330 
hockey team was so incredibly successful
was<00:01:16.960> because<00:01:16.990> they<00:01:17.470> played<00:01:17.650> against<00:01:17.890> boys<00:01:18.130> so

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
was because they played against boys so

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.190 
was because they played against boys so
for<00:01:18.520> these<00:01:18.610> young<00:01:18.880> girls<00:01:19.030> to<00:01:19.330> playing<00:01:19.870> against

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
for these young girls to playing against

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.530 
for these young girls to playing against
boys<00:01:20.350> in<00:01:20.680> a<00:01:20.770> safe<00:01:21.040> environment<00:01:21.190> is<00:01:22.060> definitely

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
boys in a safe environment is definitely

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.080 
boys in a safe environment is definitely
going<00:01:22.630> to<00:01:22.720> benefit

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
going to benefit

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.240 

cap<00:01:25.780> like<00:01:25.960> this<00:01:26.109> is<00:01:26.229> when<00:01:26.380> as<00:01:26.890> a<00:01:26.950> young<00:01:27.070> person

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
cap like this is when as a young person

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.039 
cap like this is when as a young person
I<00:01:27.850> think<00:01:28.270> definitely<00:01:28.390> would<00:01:28.659> have<00:01:28.689> given<00:01:28.929> me

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
I think definitely would have given me

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:31.980 
I think definitely would have given me
an<00:01:29.140> idea<00:01:29.259> of<00:01:29.619> what<00:01:30.100> it<00:01:30.250> takes<00:01:30.549> to<00:01:30.850> take<00:01:31.719> it<00:01:31.869> up

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
an idea of what it takes to take it up

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.690 
an idea of what it takes to take it up
to<00:01:32.079> the<00:01:32.109> next<00:01:32.200> level<00:01:32.439> or<00:01:32.799> you<00:01:32.890> play<00:01:33.490> for<00:01:33.640> your

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.929 
to the next level or you play for your
country<00:01:34.380> it's<00:01:35.380> it's<00:01:35.890> a<00:01:36.069> high<00:01:36.460> performance

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
country it's it's a high performance

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:38.219 
country it's it's a high performance
sort<00:01:37.030> of<00:01:37.119> an<00:01:37.270> environment<00:01:37.750> you<00:01:37.899> get<00:01:38.049> some

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.250 
know it helps a lot actually
I<00:01:50.869> think<00:01:51.770> the<00:01:51.950> best<00:01:52.580> memory<00:01:53.150> is<00:01:53.450> generally

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
I think the best memory is generally

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.160 
I think the best memory is generally
happens<00:01:54.560> on<00:01:54.710> the<00:01:54.830> last<00:01:55.070> day<00:01:55.369> when<00:01:55.869> all<00:01:56.869> the

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
happens on the last day when all the

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.480 
happens on the last day when all the
girls<00:01:57.440> and<00:01:57.619> all<00:01:57.680> the<00:01:57.799> boys<00:01:57.920> are<00:01:58.070> playing<00:01:58.310> and

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
girls and all the boys are playing and

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.800 
girls and all the boys are playing and
we<00:01:58.549> get<00:01:58.729> to<00:01:58.850> see<00:01:59.030> how<00:01:59.150> far<00:01:59.180> they'd<00:01:59.570> come<00:01:59.780> over
