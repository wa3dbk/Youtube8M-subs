00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
session just now you know caught a lot

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.750 
session just now you know caught a lot
of<00:00:48.769> ways<00:00:48.890> that<00:00:49.070> normally<00:00:49.339> wouldn't<00:00:49.489> caught

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
of ways that normally wouldn't caught

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.369 
of ways that normally wouldn't caught
because<00:00:49.909> you<00:00:50.239> know<00:00:50.690> it's<00:00:50.809> kind<00:00:50.960> of<00:00:50.989> mushy<00:00:51.110> wave

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
because you know it's kind of mushy wave

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:52.390 
because you know it's kind of mushy wave
and<00:00:51.530> you<00:00:51.589> don't<00:00:51.769> think<00:00:51.920> you<00:00:51.979> can<00:00:52.070> catch<00:00:52.190> it<00:00:52.339> but

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
and you don't think you can catch it but

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.189 
and you don't think you can catch it but
on<00:00:52.489> the<00:00:52.580> wave<00:00:52.670> jet<00:00:52.879> you<00:00:53.000> can<00:00:53.119> catch<00:00:53.299> it<00:00:53.479> so<00:00:53.720> it's

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
on the wave jet you can catch it so it's

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:55.479 
on the wave jet you can catch it so it's
still<00:00:54.409> you<00:00:54.949> know<00:00:54.979> even<00:00:55.220> though<00:00:55.280> you're<00:00:55.400> using

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
still you know even though you're using

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:56.740 
still you know even though you're using
a<00:00:55.640> wave<00:00:55.760> Jesse<00:00:56.059> seems<00:00:56.239> a<00:00:56.330> little<00:00:56.390> easier<00:00:56.690> to

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
a wave Jesse seems a little easier to

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.149 
a wave Jesse seems a little easier to
paddle<00:00:56.869> it's<00:00:57.019> still<00:00:57.229> a<00:00:57.260> workout<00:00:57.619> too<00:00:57.799> because

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
to trying it on and just see how much

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.389 
to trying it on and just see how much
earlier<00:01:29.600> I<00:01:29.840> can<00:01:29.899> pound<00:01:30.170> the<00:01:30.289> wave<00:01:30.499> and<00:01:30.679> and<00:01:31.009> if

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
earlier I can pound the wave and and if

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:32.679 
earlier I can pound the wave and and if
I<00:01:31.490> can<00:01:31.579> get<00:01:31.700> into<00:01:31.789> that<00:01:31.880> really<00:01:32.210> big<00:01:32.509> one<00:01:32.659> that

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
I can get into that really big one that

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:34.029 
I can get into that really big one that
I<00:01:32.869> couldn't<00:01:33.140> catch<00:01:33.259> before<00:01:33.590> you<00:01:33.740> know<00:01:33.829> because

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:34.039 
I couldn't catch before you know because

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:35.499 
I couldn't catch before you know because
every<00:01:34.520> time<00:01:34.579> I<00:01:34.700> start<00:01:34.880> to<00:01:34.939> eat<00:01:35.179> is<00:01:35.270> always<00:01:35.450> the

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
every time I start to eat is always the

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:36.700 
every time I start to eat is always the
way<00:01:35.630> that<00:01:35.810> gets<00:01:35.960> underneath<00:01:36.200> me<00:01:36.380> and<00:01:36.439> I<00:01:36.499> can't

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
way that gets underneath me and I can't

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.020 
way that gets underneath me and I can't
catch<00:01:36.890> it<00:01:36.920> or<00:01:37.130> I<00:01:37.189> just<00:01:37.340> look<00:01:37.490> at<00:01:37.609> I<00:01:37.640> like<00:01:37.850> don't

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
catch it or I just look at I like don't

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.539 
catch it or I just look at I like don't
even<00:01:38.179> want<00:01:38.299> to<00:01:38.329> try<00:01:38.539> because<00:01:38.719> so<00:01:38.990> gnarly<00:01:39.229> but

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
even want to try because so gnarly but

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:42.039 
even want to try because so gnarly but
they're<00:01:40.549> my<00:01:40.759> I<00:01:40.789> might<00:01:41.179> be<00:01:41.630> able<00:01:41.689> to<00:01:41.810> get<00:01:41.960> them

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
they're my I might be able to get them

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:43.899 
they're my I might be able to get them
on<00:01:42.140> this<00:01:42.289> board<00:01:42.560> so<00:01:42.770> if<00:01:43.069> I<00:01:43.249> don't<00:01:43.399> know<00:01:43.490> -<00:01:43.549> I<00:01:43.670> try

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
on this board so if I don't know - I try

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:45.429 
on this board so if I don't know - I try
it<00:01:43.969> so<00:01:44.179> I<00:01:44.210> think<00:01:44.420> later<00:01:44.719> this<00:01:44.840> next<00:01:45.289> to<00:01:45.350> the

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
it so I think later this next to the

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:46.809 
it so I think later this next to the
summer<00:01:45.649> coming<00:01:45.890> up<00:01:46.039> I'm<00:01:46.159> gonna<00:01:46.249> give<00:01:46.700> it<00:01:46.729> a

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:46.819 
summer coming up I'm gonna give it a

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:48.130 
summer coming up I'm gonna give it a
shot<00:01:46.999> and<00:01:47.149> see<00:01:47.210> how<00:01:47.359> big<00:01:47.509> a<00:01:47.569> wave<00:01:47.719> I<00:01:47.869> can<00:01:47.899> write

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
shot and see how big a wave I can write

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:56.649 
shot and see how big a wave I can write
a<00:01:48.170> choke<00:01:48.380> on<00:01:48.619> it<00:01:48.710> so

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.719
