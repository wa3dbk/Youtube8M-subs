being attacked four five six seven eight
nine<00:03:02.080> times<00:03:02.380> I<00:03:02.470> think<00:03:02.680> he's<00:03:02.770> taking<00:03:03.070> the<00:03:03.160> leap

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
nine times I think he's taking the leap

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.220 
nine times I think he's taking the leap
will<00:03:03.490> attack<00:03:03.760> by<00:03:03.940> now<00:03:04.180> so<00:03:04.780> it<00:03:04.900> looks<00:03:04.930> like<00:03:05.080> that

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
will attack by now so it looks like that

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.540 
will attack by now so it looks like that
lightning<00:03:05.530> bolts<00:03:05.680> gonna<00:03:05.830> have<00:03:05.950> to<00:03:06.070> go<00:03:06.160> towards

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
a creeping tar pit maybe it's maybe it

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.440 
a creeping tar pit maybe it's maybe it
may<00:03:08.860> not<00:03:09.010> be<00:03:09.070> a<00:03:09.190> lethal<00:03:09.400> attack<00:03:09.850> I<00:03:10.090> think<00:03:10.420> that

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
may not be a lethal attack I think that

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.940 
may not be a lethal attack I think that

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
bolt may be going upstairs make sure our

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.590 
bolt may be going upstairs make sure our
light<00:03:12.220> tolls<00:03:12.430> are<00:03:12.580> confirmed<00:03:13.030> exactly<00:03:13.180> where

light tolls are confirmed exactly where
they're<00:03:13.750> at<00:03:13.900> because<00:03:14.230> if<00:03:14.440> that<00:03:14.590> bolts<00:03:14.980> going

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
they're at because if that bolts going

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.740 
they're at because if that bolts going
upstairs<00:03:15.519> what<00:03:15.790> that<00:03:15.940> means<00:03:16.180> is<00:03:16.450> that<00:03:16.480> he's

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
upstairs what that means is that he's

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.150 
upstairs what that means is that he's
trying<00:03:16.989> to<00:03:17.140> draw<00:03:17.260> price<00:03:17.500> of<00:03:17.620> progress<00:03:17.769> to<00:03:18.040> win

brainstorm répondre aficionado is that

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:44.860 
brainstorm répondre aficionado is that
you're<00:05:43.910> supposed<00:05:44.150> take<00:05:44.270> the<00:05:44.389> mystery<00:05:44.599> card

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
you're supposed take the mystery card

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.390 
you're supposed take the mystery card
and<00:05:45.050> if<00:05:45.380> it's<00:05:45.530> a<00:05:45.590> blue<00:05:45.740> card<00:05:45.949> you're<00:05:46.070> redraws

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
and if it's a blue card you're redraws

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.620 
and if it's a blue card you're redraws
or<00:05:46.550> even<00:05:46.729> better<00:05:46.910> than

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:47.630 
or even better than

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:52.240 
or even better than
solutely<00:05:48.020> now<00:05:50.320> there's<00:05:51.320> a<00:05:51.380> grim<00:05:51.620> lava<00:05:51.860> man<00:05:52.070> sir

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
solutely now there's a grim lava man sir

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.090 
solutely now there's a grim lava man sir
in<00:05:52.430> that<00:05:52.640> group<00:05:52.910> and<00:05:53.090> a<00:05:53.780> red<00:05:54.260> elemental<00:05:54.800> blast

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:55.100 
in that group and a red elemental blast

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.540 
in that group and a red elemental blast
so<00:05:55.700> he<00:05:55.880> can<00:05:56.180> jump<00:05:57.170> for<00:05:57.620> a<00:05:57.650> little<00:05:58.010> bit<00:05:58.220> longer

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
so he can jump for a little bit longer

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.970 
so he can jump for a little bit longer
that<00:05:59.420> grim<00:05:59.630> lava<00:05:59.810> men<00:05:59.990> sir<00:06:00.140> can<00:06:00.410> hop<00:06:00.680> in<00:06:00.860> the

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:00.980 
that grim lava men sir can hop in the

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.730 
that grim lava men sir can hop in the
way<00:06:01.540> but<00:06:02.540> the<00:06:02.660> chump<00:06:02.930> actually<00:06:03.260> doesn't<00:06:03.500> help

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
way but the chump actually doesn't help

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.410 
way but the chump actually doesn't help
because<00:06:03.800> the<00:06:04.100> top<00:06:04.280> of<00:06:04.430> his<00:06:04.550> library<00:06:04.730> is<00:06:05.180> dead

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:05.420 
because the top of his library is dead

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.050 
because the top of his library is dead
yeah<00:06:05.810> and<00:06:06.050> additionally<00:06:06.980> we<00:06:07.730> saw<00:06:07.940> that

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
yeah and additionally we saw that

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.640 
yeah and additionally we saw that
there's<00:06:08.240> an<00:06:08.360> abrupt<00:06:08.570> decay<00:06:08.750> in<00:06:08.990> his<00:06:09.290> hand<00:06:09.500> so

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:09.650 
there's an abrupt decay in his hand so

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:10.900 
there's an abrupt decay in his hand so
he's<00:06:09.770> going<00:06:09.920> to<00:06:10.040> resolve<00:06:10.220> ancestral<00:06:10.760> visions

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:10.910 
he's going to resolve ancestral visions

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:12.640 
he's going to resolve ancestral visions
looks<00:06:11.780> like<00:06:11.900> he's<00:06:12.020> going<00:06:12.170> to<00:06:12.260> slide<00:06:12.440> some

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:12.650 
looks like he's going to slide some

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.100 
looks like he's going to slide some

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
man I think we're gonna go see an abrupt

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.340 
man I think we're gonna go see an abrupt
decay<00:06:16.700> you<00:06:17.120> can't<00:06:17.420> kind<00:06:17.600> of<00:06:17.720> that<00:06:17.900> get<00:06:18.140> that

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.350 
decay you can't kind of that get that

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:19.780 
decay you can't kind of that get that
out<00:06:18.530> of<00:06:18.560> the<00:06:18.740> way<00:06:18.770> get<00:06:19.160> you<00:06:19.370> out<00:06:19.520> of<00:06:19.550> the<00:06:19.700> way
