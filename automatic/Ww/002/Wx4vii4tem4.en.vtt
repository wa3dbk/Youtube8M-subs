00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.660
 what kitchen appliances is 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.869
 irreplaceable in the kitchen there is practically 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.879
 each house is of course a blender and this 

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:16.490
 online store photos my name is Julia and 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:19.390
 Today we have 5 blenders in the review 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.390
 from keen 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.540
 all these models have the same motor 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.900
 block and the difference between them is 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:32.599
 only in the configuration but they will tell 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.640
 detail a little later the first to that 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.489
 worth paying attention is high 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.679
 device power 700 watts not every 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.390
 the blender boasts such strength 

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:44.210
 thanks to it can be processed 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.940
 a large number of products for a very 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.800
 short time and the results will be just 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.600
 superb 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.620
 white blender motor block with 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.839
 gray inserts 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.629
 thanks to ergonomic non-slip 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:58.550
 pens are very convenient to use 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.749
 buttons are located successful and pressed 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.179
 easy enough 

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:04.159
 despite the fact that to work blender 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:06.800
 the button must constantly hold the hand 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.020
 not at all tired of a slight flaw 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.600
 is that select the desired speed 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.670
 no opportunity manufacturers 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.190
 left us a choice or standard 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.200
 speed or turbo and this is not very good 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.630
 because sometimes you need to clearly regulate 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.580
 cooking process change nozzles 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.250
 very simple just press two 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.440
 buttons on the sides and set the required 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.200
 regardless of the model in the arsenal of any 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.330
 blender there is a nozzle for grinding 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.370
 she is the main without her 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.860
 do with it you can cook 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:40.010
 baby food mixed soups 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.900
 mayonnaise sauces and much more now 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.330
 on your eyes with a blender 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.070
 kenwood we will make mayonnaise for this 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.970
 we will need sunflower oil 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.970
 mustard salt pepper and egg 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.970
 let's get started 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.580
 4 models of nozzle for grinding 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.220
 made of stainless steel and only in 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.810
 the fifth namely 710 blender she 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.970
 made of plastic 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.790
 of course stainless steel blender 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.459
 more eco-friendly durable and does not darken 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.940
 over time but plastic where 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.150
 easier 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.880
 pay attention to their knives 3 and they 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.739
 arranged at different angles thanks 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.040
 this cooking process becomes 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:47.519
 even easier at the base there are six notches 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.690
 they prevent splashing and 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.910
 attract ingredients to blades 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.700
 thanks to this you do not need to keep 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.400
 blender for a visa all the time ooo grooves 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.700
 inside the base push the product to 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.290
 blades complete with 13 and 14 models 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.690
 except the standard nozzle for 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.579
 grinding there is also a nozzle with 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.650
 enlarged leg with its help 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:11.349
 make a puree soup for a very short 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.260
 time due to the fact that ati avito her 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:16.030
 grounds large 10 centimeters she 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.730
 perfect for handling big 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.220
 quantities of the product using a blender 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.870
 kena today we make mashed soup for 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.540
 this we need onions 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.760
 olive oil 100 grams of cream 1 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.900
 carrots and two potatoes and most importantly 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.900
 no pans 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:49.620
 and if you can't imagine your life 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:52.410
 without varnish then pay attention to 11 or 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.630
 14 models are bundled with them 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.690
 whisk it can be done 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.959

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.850
 and much more 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.290
 Now let's talk about the nozzle which is 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:08.730
 only in one model 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.360
 14 n it is finely personal it just happens 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.030
 excited 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.790
 it can be used to make mashed potatoes 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.430
 from boiled vegetables like potatoes 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.470
 beet or carrot special blades 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.100
 and push the product through the small 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.400
 holes 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.530
 the tour is very gentle and airy 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.650
 mashed potatoes did not require much 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.600
 time and most importantly, we managed to try 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.040
 It turned out very Crimea all this in 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.740
 any model is included 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.960
 750 graduated bowl with handle 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.880
 milliliters big plus is then 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.720
 that it is equipped with a special rubber 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.940
 stand 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.050
 so that the glass does not fidget 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.850
 work surface 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.090
 by the way this stand can be used 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.919
 as a cover be careful sometimes 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.530
 after using in blender drive 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:55.410
 there may be gum from nozzles this 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.390
 no harm to the device just if 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.580
 you will not notice this tunis can take 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:02.430
 another tip so my advice to you 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.240
 always after use see everything 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.850
