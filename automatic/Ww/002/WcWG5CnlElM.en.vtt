yeah<00:02:26.300> there's<00:02:26.480> the<00:02:26.629> bone<00:02:26.780> shadow<00:02:27.280> so<00:02:28.280> all<00:02:28.430> the

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
yeah there's the bone shadow so all the

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.550 
yeah there's the bone shadow so all the
the<00:02:29.030> spiky<00:02:29.480> bits<00:02:29.629> they<00:02:29.959> were<00:02:30.019> all<00:02:30.200> given<00:02:30.470> the

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
the spiky bits they were all given the

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.789 
the spiky bits they were all given the
bone<00:02:30.709> colors<00:02:31.099> I've<00:02:31.700> got<00:02:31.879> some<00:02:32.290> that's<00:02:33.290> a<00:02:33.500> bolt

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
bone colors I've got some that's a bolt

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.130 
bone colors I've got some that's a bolt
gun<00:02:33.860> metal<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:34.700> there's<00:02:35.269> the<00:02:35.450> wood<00:02:35.660> there<00:02:35.959> as

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
gun metal and there's the wood there as

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.640 
gun metal and there's the wood there as
well<00:02:36.349> so<00:02:37.599> there<00:02:38.599> we<00:02:38.690> go<00:02:38.840> scorched<00:02:39.200> metal<00:02:39.530> is

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
well so there we go scorched metal is

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:46.710 
well so there we go scorched metal is
this<00:02:39.830> one<00:02:40.720> it's<00:02:41.720> kind<00:02:41.930> of<00:02:42.019> like<00:02:42.140> ten<00:02:42.349> bits<00:02:42.970> 4gw

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.160 

okay<00:02:47.720> so<00:02:47.780> here<00:02:48.079> we<00:02:48.140> go<00:02:48.260> a<00:02:48.349> bit<00:02:48.500> more<00:02:48.680> colors

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
okay so here we go a bit more colors

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.420 
okay so here we go a bit more colors
building<00:02:51.170> up<00:02:51.260> the<00:02:51.380> bones<00:02:51.590> here<00:02:51.920> so<00:02:51.950> that's<00:02:52.220> the

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
building up the bones here so that's the

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.789 
building up the bones here so that's the
the<00:02:52.730> bone<00:02:52.910> triad<00:02:53.450> so<00:02:54.019> just<00:02:54.230> working<00:02:54.380> my<00:02:54.590> way<00:02:54.620> up

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
the bone triad so just working my way up

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.160 
the bone triad so just working my way up
so<00:02:55.130> bone<00:02:55.310> shadow<00:02:55.579> goes<00:02:55.880> the<00:02:56.030> base<00:02:56.180> everything

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
so bone shadow goes the base everything

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.720 
so bone shadow goes the base everything
but<00:02:57.290> the<00:02:57.380> cracks<00:02:57.620> are<00:02:57.860> each<00:02:58.010> bone<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:58.610> then

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
but the cracks are each bone and then

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.369 
but the cracks are each bone and then
just<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.090> edge<00:02:59.239> highlighting<00:02:59.810> is<00:02:59.959> polished

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:00.379 
just the edge highlighting is polished

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.979 
just the edge highlighting is polished
bone<00:03:00.590> and<00:03:00.879> same<00:03:01.879> with<00:03:02.000> the<00:03:02.090> stones<00:03:02.420> here<00:03:02.750> so

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
bone and same with the stones here so

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.250 
bone and same with the stones here so
stone<00:03:03.230> shadow<00:03:04.090> cover<00:03:05.090> all<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:05.750> flat<00:03:05.959> areas

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
stone shadow cover all the flat areas

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.930 
stone shadow cover all the flat areas
with<00:03:06.379> stone<00:03:06.620> gray<00:03:06.829> and<00:03:07.160> then<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:07.400> edges<00:03:07.730> with

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
with stone gray and then the edges with

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.289 
with stone gray and then the edges with
stone<00:03:08.239> whether<00:03:08.810> it's<00:03:08.989> stone<00:03:09.970> and<00:03:10.970> you<00:03:11.060> can<00:03:11.180> see

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
stone whether it's stone and you can see

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:13.300 
stone whether it's stone and you can see
I've<00:03:11.450> done<00:03:11.480> the<00:03:11.810> finished<00:03:12.470> B<00:03:12.680> highlights<00:03:13.069> on

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
I've done the finished B highlights on

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.580 
I've done the finished B highlights on
the<00:03:13.489> wheel<00:03:13.640> they're<00:03:13.940> all<00:03:14.420> the<00:03:14.599> wood<00:03:14.810> that's

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
the wheel they're all the wood that's

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.660 
the wheel they're all the wood that's
just<00:03:15.829> that<00:03:15.980> would<00:03:16.370> shield<00:03:16.879> drown<00:03:17.209> triad

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
just that would shield drown triad

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.690 
just that would shield drown triad
now<00:03:20.329> with<00:03:20.840> these<00:03:21.079> I've<00:03:21.590> done<00:03:21.889> about<00:03:22.160> a<00:03:22.310> black

black wash and then highlighting the
edges<00:03:27.530> with<00:03:27.709> GW<00:03:28.250> chainmail<00:03:29.349> and<00:03:30.349> here's<00:03:30.560> a<00:03:30.769> bit

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:30.889 
edges with GW chainmail and here's a bit

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:32.949 
edges with GW chainmail and here's a bit
of<00:03:30.980> a<00:03:31.040> close-up<00:03:31.489> on<00:03:31.609> this<00:03:31.849> stone<00:03:32.150> not<00:03:32.780> too

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
of a close-up on this stone not too

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.099 
of a close-up on this stone not too
extreme<00:03:33.440> on<00:03:33.650> the<00:03:33.769> highlighting<00:03:34.810> again<00:03:35.810> just

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.109 
extreme on the highlighting again just

extreme on the highlighting again just
use<00:03:37.040> that<00:03:37.190> triad<00:03:38.319> okay<00:03:39.319> getting<00:03:39.980> closer<00:03:40.400> to

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:40.609 
use that triad okay getting closer to

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:42.970 
use that triad okay getting closer to
being<00:03:40.790> finished<00:03:40.849> here<00:03:41.450> you<00:03:42.230> can<00:03:42.349> see<00:03:42.530> the<00:03:42.739> the

all of the cracks and then I'm gonna

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.130 
all of the cracks and then I'm gonna
highlight<00:05:39.430> that<00:05:39.610> metal<00:05:40.060> later<00:05:40.270> so<00:05:40.840> it<00:05:40.900> doesn't

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:41.140
