00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
you kind of reeled him in a little bit

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.339 
you kind of reeled him in a little bit
with<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.370> few<00:02:50.640> laps<00:02:50.819> to<00:02:50.970> go<00:02:51.120> yeah<00:02:51.750> like<00:02:51.989> I<00:02:52.110> said<00:02:52.319> I

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
with a few laps to go yeah like I said I

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.740 
with a few laps to go yeah like I said I
was<00:02:52.860> pumped<00:02:53.190> up<00:02:53.310> real<00:02:53.610> real<00:02:53.819> bad<00:02:54.060> early<00:02:54.360> on<00:02:54.510> and

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
was pumped up real real bad early on and

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.809 
was pumped up real real bad early on and
it<00:02:54.959> went<00:02:55.140> away<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:55.590> I<00:02:55.860> started<00:02:56.580> putting<00:02:56.670> in

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
it went away and I started putting in

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.850 
it went away and I started putting in
some<00:02:56.940> decent<00:02:57.269> laps<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:57.780> we<00:02:58.319> kind<00:02:58.530> of<00:02:58.590> knew<00:02:58.830> I

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
some decent laps and we kind of knew I

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.559 
some decent laps and we kind of knew I
figured<00:02:59.310> we<00:02:59.430> I<00:02:59.640> wasn't<00:02:59.879> going<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:00.120> make<00:03:00.390> up

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
figured we I wasn't going to make up

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.930 
figured we I wasn't going to make up
tons<00:03:01.410> of<00:03:01.620> ground<00:03:01.830> on<00:03:02.010> him<00:03:02.129> but<00:03:02.310> I<00:03:02.340> want<00:03:02.700> to<00:03:02.819> put

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
tons of ground on him but I want to put

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.620 
tons of ground on him but I want to put
in<00:03:03.030> a<00:03:03.120> good<00:03:03.269> charge<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:03.950> make<00:03:04.950> sure<00:03:05.010> I<00:03:05.630> stayed

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
in a good charge and make sure I stayed

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.509 
in a good charge and make sure I stayed
at<00:03:06.780> a<00:03:06.810> solid<00:03:07.019> second<00:03:07.470> place<00:03:07.650> but<00:03:07.980> um<00:03:08.130> yeah<00:03:08.489> I

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
at a solid second place but um yeah I

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.759 
at a solid second place but um yeah I
was<00:03:08.549> real<00:03:08.819> unfortunate<00:03:08.970> for<00:03:09.480> Josh<00:03:09.989> and<00:03:10.019> Cory

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
was real unfortunate for Josh and Cory

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.440 
was real unfortunate for Josh and Cory
to<00:03:10.920> go<00:03:11.040> down<00:03:11.250> and<00:03:11.519> I<00:03:11.700> figured<00:03:12.269> those<00:03:12.390> guys

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
to go down and I figured those guys

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.420 
to go down and I figured those guys
would<00:03:12.720> be<00:03:12.840> right<00:03:12.989> up<00:03:13.019> there<00:03:13.140> too<00:03:13.440> yeah<00:03:14.160> might

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
would be right up there too yeah might

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.250 
would be right up there too yeah might

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
around I'm learning quickly there's a it

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.689 
around I'm learning quickly there's a it
doesn't<00:06:10.889> seem<00:06:11.009> like<00:06:11.039> there's<00:06:11.370> a<00:06:11.430> lot<00:06:11.580> to<00:06:11.669> learn

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:11.699 
doesn't seem like there's a lot to learn

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:14.870 
doesn't seem like there's a lot to learn
from<00:06:12.800> last<00:06:13.800> year<00:06:14.159> because<00:06:14.490> I<00:06:14.580> was<00:06:14.699> catching

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 
from last year because I was catching

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.490 
from last year because I was catching
those<00:06:15.060> guys<00:06:15.120> and<00:06:15.539> riding<00:06:15.779> with<00:06:15.900> them<00:06:16.020> but<00:06:16.199> i'm

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.500 
those guys and riding with them but i'm

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.629 
those guys and riding with them but i'm
starting<00:06:16.770> with<00:06:16.949> them<00:06:17.099> as<00:06:17.159> a<00:06:17.219> whole<00:06:17.340> different

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:17.639 
starting with them as a whole different

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:19.580 
starting with them as a whole different
story<00:06:17.819> it's<00:06:18.090> it's<00:06:18.360> it's<00:06:18.719> pretty<00:06:18.960> weird<00:06:19.139> I<00:06:19.379> I

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
story it's it's it's pretty weird I I

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:20.869 
story it's it's it's pretty weird I I
figured<00:06:20.069> I'd<00:06:20.159> be<00:06:20.250> doing<00:06:20.460> a<00:06:20.490> little<00:06:20.639> bit<00:06:20.759> better
