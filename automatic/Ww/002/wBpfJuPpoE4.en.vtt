flawlessly I still feel like it's a tool
that's<00:01:28.369> better<00:01:28.909> than<00:01:29.179> the<00:01:29.210> knife<00:01:29.569> because<00:01:30.079> it

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
that's better than the knife because it

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.629 
that's better than the knife because it
quickly<00:01:32.869> and<00:01:33.170> easily<00:01:33.319> takes<00:01:33.829> out<00:01:34.069> the<00:01:34.100> center

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
jury's a little bit still out it seems

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.889 
jury's a little bit still out it seems
to<00:01:51.759> have<00:01:51.970> some<00:01:52.180> good<00:01:52.299> benefits<00:01:54.720> but<00:01:55.720> at<00:01:55.810> the

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
to have some good benefits but at the

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:04.820 
to have some good benefits but at the
same<00:01:56.170> time<00:01:56.350> it's<00:01:56.590> definitely<00:01:57.040> not<00:01:57.189> perfect

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.320 

but<00:02:05.830> if<00:02:05.920> you're<00:02:06.100> making<00:02:06.429> strawberry<00:02:06.729> jam<00:02:07.090> I<00:02:07.270> do

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.240 
and then here's all that all I'm really
losing<00:03:08.540> is<00:03:08.840> that<00:03:09.019> center<00:03:09.470> white<00:03:09.739> part<00:03:10.069> of<00:03:10.189> the

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250
