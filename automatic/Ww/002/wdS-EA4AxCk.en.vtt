sitting for horror type stuff so we set
out<00:02:10.000> to<00:02:10.119> do<00:02:10.270> a<00:02:10.660> skeleton<00:02:11.530> and<00:02:11.739> lots<00:02:12.010> of<00:02:12.130> silly

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
out to do a skeleton and lots of silly

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.650 
out to do a skeleton and lots of silly
things<00:02:12.910> are<00:02:13.000> scaled<00:02:13.209> to<00:02:13.270> the<00:02:13.330> five<00:02:15.510> we've<00:02:16.510> got

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
things are scaled to the five we've got

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.090 
things are scaled to the five we've got
quite<00:02:16.810> a<00:02:16.870> lot<00:02:16.900> of<00:02:17.020> attack<00:02:17.410> moves<00:02:17.770> and<00:02:18.040> then

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
quite a lot of attack moves and then

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.800 
quite a lot of attack moves and then
these<00:02:18.280> I<00:02:18.340> think<00:02:18.640> that's<00:02:18.880> quite<00:02:19.030> powerful<00:02:19.360> in

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
these I think that's quite powerful in

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.809 
these I think that's quite powerful in
it<00:02:19.959> but<00:02:20.319> at<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:20.470> same<00:02:20.590> time<00:02:20.860> he's<00:02:21.069> got<00:02:21.280> huge

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
it but at the same time he's got huge

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.630 
it but at the same time he's got huge
floppy<00:02:22.330> feet<00:02:22.630> making<00:02:23.290> look<00:02:23.560> a<00:02:23.739> bit<00:02:24.370> sort<00:02:24.610> of

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
floppy feet making look a bit sort of

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.000 
floppy feet making look a bit sort of
onesie<00:02:25.450> as<00:02:25.540> he<00:02:25.630> runs<00:02:25.810> around<00:02:25.959> that<00:02:26.800> we're<00:02:26.920> not

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
onesie as he runs around that we're not

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.680 
onesie as he runs around that we're not
trying<00:02:27.310> to<00:02:27.340> do<00:02:27.489> a<00:02:27.519> character<00:02:27.819> that's<00:02:28.120> Conan

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
trying to do a character that's Conan

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.780 
trying to do a character that's Conan
the<00:02:28.720> Barbarian<00:02:28.810> or<00:02:29.410> something<00:02:29.680> he's<00:02:29.830> here's<00:02:30.730> a

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
the Barbarian or something he's here's a

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.600 
the Barbarian or something he's here's a
bit<00:02:31.560> alternative<00:02:32.560> it's<00:02:33.220> a<00:02:33.310> sort<00:02:33.489> of<00:02:33.519> an

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
bit alternative it's a sort of an

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.400 
bit alternative it's a sort of an
accidental<00:02:34.030> hero<00:02:34.360> really<00:02:34.750> though<00:02:35.260> I<00:02:35.290> think

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
accidental hero really though I think

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.630 
accidental hero really though I think
it's<00:02:35.620> more<00:02:35.739> for<00:02:35.950> people<00:02:36.069> who<00:02:36.310> are<00:02:36.370> growing<00:02:36.519> up

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
it's more for people who are growing up

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.569 
it's more for people who are growing up
who<00:02:36.790> still<00:02:37.030> think<00:02:37.239> that<00:02:37.269> kids
