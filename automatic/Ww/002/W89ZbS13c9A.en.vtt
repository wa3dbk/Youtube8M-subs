00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:12.919
 the side in the month under analysis - the person in charge of the pedagogical section 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:17.419
 to marry us and responsible for the film project that hinders 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:21.489
 Let's talk a little bit about life to two today. 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:23.279
 and the relationship with money 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.470
 the palm trees promise to tell you why it's so hard we 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.009
 we talked with our partners with our partner about the issues 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:32.340
 financial 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.010
 or better 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.170
 difficult to talk about money when the family's financial situation 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.240
 go well 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.240
 this is a problem that many people face an opponent 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.550
 one of the amendments 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.880
 of married husbands worried about the economic situation 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.540
 family and does not know how to 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.460
 by the way 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.430
 with your partner 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.120
 some specialists who study the subject of human behavior and they have some 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.429
 which may have happened because it is a challenge until then. 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:06.700
 you to talk to your partner partners about sensitive issues and the 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.630
 money without stops 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.980
 the first reason 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.770
 basit would be our human condition 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.130
 we have our subjectivity to our individuality and in questions 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.310
 financial 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.330
 this is also present 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.820
 we have in relation to the day of our personal history 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.630
 because we have learned that we have lived from childhood in our 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.870
 home and we do it for the adult life and when we are going to divide the space 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.160
 with another person 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.510
 when you miss the issues are two different games in the form of verify 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:40.900
 financial matters are 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.060
 very different 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.650
 willing to generate new conflicts 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.370
 is a classic example the couple's is very good because weighted the searches 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.400
 hope this does planning and the other 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.869
 it is most recent to pay dearly 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:57.770
 dying, do not pay attention to him 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.220
 the inclusion of serious 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.450
 The use of credit card this big difference usually brings new 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.520
 conflicts 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.370
 inside the house 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.870
 the other factor that very few djs is the moment 

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:15.809
 must be to express your discontent with the 

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:16.330
 situation 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.049
 do not belong to your family 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:19.620
 this fear ahead 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.170
 because you can keep thinking so if I talk to him about it 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.459
 her about our situation. 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.769
 this can take away from our pattern of state coexistence 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.739
 in a good counterattack which is a practical fallacy about this 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.999
 and disrupt my relationship that goes so well 

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:42.799
 other man also of the responsibility that this conversation will generate in her the 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.990
 newcastle and when you bring scenes ready for the table 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.099
 You're going to have to take 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.140
 two attitudes and sometimes unconsciously we are afraid of this 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:54.510
 responsibility that will be established at that time 

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:58.919
 so this is a very important question that we should think about which are 

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:02.099
 our fears all we do not talk about money 

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:08.079
 and what are our tables that prevent us from being exchanging an idea with the 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.729
 our partner in this regard 

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:12.739
 another problem that happened 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.879
 is the person feel effects of the financial situation 

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:18.879
 when financial dependence 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:24.319
 print a character that negative meaning to person it becomes hostage 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:25.459
 in this situation 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.479
 and this will generate distress anxiety 

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:31.949
 discontent and this ends up affecting the 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:36.589
 so if one person is dependent financially the other the other is that 

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:39.479
 has in charge the value of the house 

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:44.639
 she can so far direct the expenses and the other feels hostage elano 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:48.839
 she does not have the courage to lean, she does not have the courage to share ideas 

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:51.839
 because it does not contribute significant income 

00:03:53.279 --> 00:03:55.239
 already in the family environment 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:56.489
 and finally 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.559
 says it's not related to lack of money but it's what happens a lot 

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:02.399
 between couples 

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:06.670
 it's just different if it could be different said carvalhaes 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:07.929
 divided 

00:04:07.929 --> 00:04:10.429
 are couples who share the same roof 

00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:14.059
 he has his works but he does not share the common dream 

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:17.269
 I share planning to name do not glimpse 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.740
 really a 2 in the league in wages they follow different paths 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.639
 and this has some moment ends up impacting on the relationship of the couple 

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:31.770
 You can not even live in neighborhoods like patients, right? 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.560
 if I knew it would be so easy if it was so magical I would give it to you 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.390
 here some concepts 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.960
 but when it comes to human behavior 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.349
 it's very complex you talk about some solutions 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:47.610
 we can think in an average first moment 

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:51.349
 I want to have a great deal of self-knowledge. 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:55.469
 we need to understand what our limits are to our blockages 

00:04:55.969 --> 00:05:00.339
 we did not talk about the financial situation with partnerships because we 

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:02.319
 we do not do family planning 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:07.139
 so you start to find the solution of each person's private 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:09.199
 through questioning 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:13.969
 It is necessary to question more if it were an awareness, I am not 

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:17.830
 satisfied with my financial life feef it is necessary to speak this with my 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:18.460
 companion 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.010
 companion, but why not? 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.710
 I do not make the limits because he 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.230
 What is it that I have in mind so I'm so you'll start attitude is 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:30.050
 disassemble these locks you have 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.919
 ra the basis for all this there is no other way is dialogue dialogue 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:37.960
 sincere and respectful squeeze 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:43.509
 and heated the people are together are dividing the same at the same time 

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:46.129
 and that situation 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:50.669
 feelings of love and respect have to be greater than any 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:54.169
 divergence that the couple can 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.529
 meet 

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:58.870
 have as principle the suspect 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:03.979
 respect for individuality we are fortunately different people and it is in this 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:07.969
 we learn we need to face the financial difficulties 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.990
 as a first step towards personal improvement improvement 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.990
 of the couple do not transform 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.779
 for the marriage couple 

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:20.830
 and is based on 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.289
 in respect and in love 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:27.800
 or one last tip is the following we need to hunt with our mate 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.960
 and companion every day every day we need to look at him to admire him 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.169
 and at home 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:35.460

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:40.440

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:45.020
