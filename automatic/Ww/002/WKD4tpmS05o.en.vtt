00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:21.960
 simply refurbished in all ice nation 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.670
 Let's assume the role of men 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.710
 Ripley daughter from the movie 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.300
 Known ellen ripley and ten years 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.380
 after the disappearance of all has on 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.109
 the end still not the hope 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.489
 lost find their mother 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.399
 therefore goes with a group of 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.989
 waves titanic operation to the space station 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.120
 Sevastopol where allegedly the 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.030
 are born black box in ostrow 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.030
 are just that spaceship with the man 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.460
 that mum then disappeared naturally 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.050
 but as you can see everything goes wrong 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.329
 Young Ripley gets fucked by her companions 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.039
 separated and must be alone from now on 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:59.699
 through this what both hit where 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:01.140
 apparently so much in the bad lies of 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.969
 Now you creep quietly through the 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.000
 dark corridors and ventilation shafts 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.890
 the space station encounters innumerable 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.780
 body bags and get rid of the 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.150
 absorb a threatening atmosphere 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.700
 although all nation does not belong to 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.400
 graphic top class has on 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.140
 consoles even annoying edged flicker 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.610
 but the excellent soundscape and 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.680
 the beautiful light shade play worry 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.670
 for a great atmosphere already at the 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.670
 first movie remembers 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.890
 playfully offers isolation unfortunately 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.990
 not a lot of variety creeps up 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.150
 hiding soft enemies 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.680
 in between you have to like in doom 3 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.480
 continuous keycards or 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.520
 Access codes look for yours before 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.830
 locked rooms could get into it 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.960
 and that was already on dhoom 3 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.380
 a bit old-fashioned 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.360
 also the occasional riddles are 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.310
 absolutely simple here, for example 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.320
 we just press the flashing one 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.500
 buttons to find a generator 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.820
 finally the door opens on it 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.820
 everybody is coming 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:17.379
 functioning 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.760
 the story is a bit flat and 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.620
 Probably none of the films to none 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.849
 At the time it is surprising 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.260
 actually not that bad there 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.750
 The atmosphere is still incredible 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.790
 is thrilling and the alien feeling great 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.500
 it starts to get annoying 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.510
 that the intermediate sequence and often 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.400
 the characters just jerk 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:50.829
 are set mediocre and the dialoge 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:52.329
 we are really moderate at first 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:52.690
 only with hostile people too 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:54.640
 do 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.230
 puts isolation really when 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.099
 finally the alien appears its big 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.319
 in front 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.910
 paired with the gloomy atmosphere and 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.280
 the very good background sound is 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.959
 A glorious threat is generated 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.120
 feels hunted from now on every time 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.790
 and pay attention to every step and every 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.950
 Sound really scary is so 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.019
 do not erase the thrill of the 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.530
 But the first film is getting really good 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.530
 captured 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.440
 with the emergence of the alien becomes the 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.760
 introduced creep mechanics but not 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.000
 only by the increased tension 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.760
 extended you can now also anytime 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.110
 Die has counted you all at once 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.950
 you have already seen yours 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:48.550
 virtual life and you will 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.550
 often from 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.950
 we die when we go through a door 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:04:00.500
 want to go and the alien ours 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:01.550
 rushed back we come to die because 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.330
 that alien us in the exploration 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.330
 surprised 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:16.730
 and we die while we are in 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.680
 hide under a table and hide 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:23.120
 the alien through the frame of the 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:30.340
 looks at table and kills moment okay 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:30.340
 But now it has to be expensive 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.120
 distracted because other people shoot 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.480
 we can pass by very quickly 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.480
 to sneak 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.940
 what the hell can now by starting the 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:52.410
 on you just to kill me shoot the 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:54.150
 sneaking past your back 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.340
 the mechanics of the actually quite right 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.010
 durchschaubar is the ki but unfortunately 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.990
 it was not perfect and inconsistent 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.300
 just watching us look at us 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.680
 The livestock here almost directly with but 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.680
 not that we are present 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.780
 not only the cone to the aliens 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.330
 always changes to wondrous 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.310
 wise also the extraterrestrial heard 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.030
 varies greatly 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.680
 here we hide 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.680
 quiet as a mouse so as not to attract attention 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:35.280
 okay, it's gone quickly then 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:36.930
 the other direction damme is the must 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.380
 have heard it again quickly 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.380
 hide 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:56.960
 hello alien 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:06:00.979
 okay that's good sneak now 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:11.810
 Continue and switch this watch quietly 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:16.129
 he does not look so fast 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:21.020
 gone now what did you hear that 

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:22.610
 but not the explosion or what this 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.110
 incomprehensible death do not gnaw 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.690
 only strong in the atmosphere but 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.639
 also knew well 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:30.590
 spaced memory point yet 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:32.539
 while the ki is unfinished and arbitrary 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:35.900
 are the human npcs just 

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:37.690
 stupid who saw me and asks 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.729
 just if something has been heard 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:42.380
 quite a nose remains playful 

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:43.909
 selection unfortunately also always flat 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.229
 crafting system with the tools 

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:47.599
 Unfortunately, that's what it is 

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:49.039
 the noise maker we put on 

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:50.810
 Use here and attract the alien 

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:53.150
 can only be used because it is the 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:54.620
 Just want to put on others 

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.449
 unfortunately happens then nothing 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.009
 tactics planning or skillful 

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:59.719
 Deception is played by the player 

00:06:58.009 --> 00:07:04.250
 not required thereby uses that 

00:06:59.719 --> 00:07:06.080
 Gameplay very fast starting later in the game 

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.430
 Although we find a flamethrower with 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.330
 that the chase away for a short time 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.099
 leave her here 

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:12.169
 However, here too the bug has devil 

00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:13.610
 slammed often the alien reacted 

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:17.289
 In our test, not even if we 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.289
 make the fire under the ass 

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:21.760
 far too rarely sets all isolation 

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:23.590
 highlights and the few exceptions 

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.690
 for those flashbacks where we have the 

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:28.450
 black box of the nostro mountains sat 

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:30.220
 playfully alone on atmosphere 

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:33.460
 We do not continue in this section 

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:36.780
 to go straight or like us 

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.780
 just to be flat from here 

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:44.320
 overall comes over his successful 

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.610
 The atmosphere is not the only way out 

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:49.120
 Although at the beginning it was excellent 

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:51.160
 succeeded countless bugs ki misfires and 

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.720
 destroy incomprehensible death 

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.820
 the thrill but gradually 

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.650
 also missing narrative and 

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:58.590
 playfully just the highlights around 

00:07:56.650 --> 00:08:03.060
 to take the title from mediocrity 

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:03.060
 wasted potential a pity
