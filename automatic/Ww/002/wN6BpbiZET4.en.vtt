00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
I believe is more of a thriller so one

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.490 
I believe is more of a thriller so one
is<00:02:49.680> also<00:02:49.980> Korean<00:02:50.340> it<00:02:50.700> is<00:02:51.030> about<00:02:51.270> two<00:02:51.990> people

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
is also Korean it is about two people

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.780 
is also Korean it is about two people
who<00:02:52.680> live<00:02:52.950> in<00:02:52.980> apartments<00:02:53.459> next<00:02:53.550> to<00:02:53.670> each

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
who live in apartments next to each

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.270 
who live in apartments next to each
other<00:02:53.910> apartment<00:02:54.870> 301<00:02:55.110> 302<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:55.980> complete

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
other apartment 301 302 and the complete

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.980 
other apartment 301 302 and the complete
opposites<00:02:56.730> and<00:02:56.910> they<00:02:57.000> hate<00:02:57.150> each<00:02:57.180> other<00:02:57.390> so<00:02:57.930> I

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
opposites and they hate each other so I

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.030 
opposites and they hate each other so I
think<00:02:58.050> they<00:02:58.410> start<00:02:58.620> trying<00:02:58.709> to<00:02:58.860> kill<00:02:58.980> each

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.740 
think they start trying to kill each
other<00:02:59.160> I<00:02:59.430> believe<00:02:59.940> that's<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.240> premise<00:03:00.420> of<00:03:00.630> it

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
really happy about four lads this one I

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.860 
really happy about four lads this one I
received<00:04:05.400> a<00:04:05.489> bootleg<00:04:05.790> of<00:04:05.880> it<00:04:06.060> and<00:04:06.239> I<00:04:06.600> snapped

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
received a bootleg of it and I snapped

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.870 
received a bootleg of it and I snapped
that<00:04:07.170> because<00:04:07.650> I<00:04:07.680> don't<00:04:08.010> like<00:04:08.070> the<00:04:08.250> legs<00:04:08.459> so<00:04:08.850> I

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
that because I don't like the legs so I

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.699 
that because I don't like the legs so I
got<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.120> official<00:04:09.480> version<00:04:09.600> and<00:04:09.989> the<00:04:10.410> bootleg

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
got the official version and the bootleg

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.550 
got the official version and the bootleg
subtitles<00:04:11.190> were<00:04:11.280> really<00:04:11.580> awful<00:04:11.940> and<00:04:12.350> it<00:04:13.350> turns

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
subtitles were really awful and it turns

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.289 
subtitles were really awful and it turns
out<00:04:13.709> that<00:04:13.769> that's<00:04:14.190> just<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:14.549> film<00:04:14.790> I<00:04:15.030> think

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
out that that's just the film I think

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:16.460 
out that that's just the film I think
part<00:04:15.450> of<00:04:15.510> the<00:04:15.600> reason<00:04:15.630> is<00:04:15.959> because<00:04:16.049> this<00:04:16.260> film

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
part of the reason is because this film

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.930 
part of the reason is because this film
is<00:04:16.590> set<00:04:16.739> way<00:04:16.979> back<00:04:17.010> in<00:04:17.430> ancient<00:04:17.760> Korea<00:04:18.299> and<00:04:18.570> so

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
is set way back in ancient Korea and so

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.900 
is set way back in ancient Korea and so
when<00:04:20.940> you<00:04:21.030> have<00:04:21.180> the<00:04:22.140> old<00:04:22.320> and<00:04:22.530> Korean<00:04:22.919> dialect

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
when you have the old and Korean dialect

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.670 
when you have the old and Korean dialect
I<00:04:24.090> think<00:04:24.330> American<00:04:24.720> translators<00:04:25.289> whoever

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
I think American translators whoever

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.540 
I think American translators whoever
translated

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
translated

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.279 
translated
has<00:04:27.060> a<00:04:27.090> harder<00:04:27.419> time<00:04:27.599> translating<00:04:28.080> it<00:04:28.259> to

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:28.289 
has a harder time translating it to

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:31.040 
has a harder time translating it to
english<00:04:28.710> that<00:04:29.129> movie<00:04:29.370> is<00:04:29.400> the<00:04:30.300> evil<00:04:30.539> twin<00:04:30.780> and

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
english that movie is the evil twin and

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.320 
english that movie is the evil twin and

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.790 
this one i think i'm gonna do a kind of
a<00:05:02.669> personal<00:05:03.030> update<00:05:03.360> because<00:05:04.110> i'm<00:05:04.379> thinking

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
a personal update because i'm thinking

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.619 
a personal update because i'm thinking
about<00:05:04.860> starting<00:05:05.099> a<00:05:05.280> new<00:05:05.400> channel<00:05:05.610> not<00:05:06.210> leaving

00:05:06.619 --> 00:05:06.629 
about starting a new channel not leaving

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:08.180 
about starting a new channel not leaving
this<00:05:06.719> one<00:05:06.900> at<00:05:07.020> all<00:05:07.110> but<00:05:07.530> starting<00:05:08.009> a<00:05:08.069> new

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
this one at all but starting a new

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.550 
this one at all but starting a new
channel<00:05:08.370> may<00:05:08.610> be<00:05:08.900> like<00:05:09.900> during<00:05:10.199> the<00:05:10.349> summer

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
channel may be like during the summer

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.790 
channel may be like during the summer
probably<00:05:10.879> because<00:05:11.879> I<00:05:12.330> hardly<00:05:13.289> have<00:05:13.469> time<00:05:13.590> for

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
probably because I hardly have time for

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.379 
probably because I hardly have time for
this<00:05:13.889> channel<00:05:14.159> right<00:05:14.340> now<00:05:14.400> and<00:05:14.729> I'm<00:05:15.270> really

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
this channel right now and I'm really

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:18.379 
this channel right now and I'm really
swamped<00:05:15.690> but<00:05:17.030> starting<00:05:18.030> a<00:05:18.090> new<00:05:18.180> channel

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:18.389 
swamped but starting a new channel

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:20.119 
swamped but starting a new channel
having<00:05:18.930> completely<00:05:19.680> to<00:05:19.830> do<00:05:19.919> with<00:05:20.039> the

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:20.129 
having completely to do with the

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:21.800 
having completely to do with the
different<00:05:20.400> subject<00:05:20.729> but<00:05:20.789> figured<00:05:21.629> I'd<00:05:21.719> just

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
different subject but figured I'd just

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.600 
different subject but figured I'd just
let<00:05:21.960> you<00:05:21.990> guys<00:05:22.199> in<00:05:22.349> on<00:05:22.409> it<00:05:22.560> most<00:05:23.400> of<00:05:23.550> you

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
let you guys in on it most of you

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:24.920 
let you guys in on it most of you
probably<00:05:23.639> won't<00:05:23.969> be<00:05:24.270> interested<00:05:24.690> in<00:05:24.750> it

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
probably won't be interested in it

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.260 
probably won't be interested in it
because<00:05:25.080> it's<00:05:25.409> it's<00:05:26.280> more<00:05:26.520> of<00:05:26.669> a<00:05:26.819> writing

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
because it's it's more of a writing

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.390 
because it's it's more of a writing
thing<00:05:27.479> but<00:05:27.870> if<00:05:27.990> you're<00:05:28.110> a<00:05:28.139> writer<00:05:28.349> and<00:05:29.099> you're

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400
