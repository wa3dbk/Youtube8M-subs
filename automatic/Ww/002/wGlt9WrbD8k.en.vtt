00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
out with a smaller travel alarm clock it

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.410 
out with a smaller travel alarm clock it
is<00:00:34.620> how<00:00:35.160> much<00:00:35.280> smaller<00:00:35.550> well<00:00:36.059> let's<00:00:36.210> take<00:00:36.390> a

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
is how much smaller well let's take a

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.840 
is how much smaller well let's take a
look<00:00:36.800> that's<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:38.040> compared<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.489> an<00:00:38.610> iPhone

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
look that's it compared to an iPhone

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.119 
look that's it compared to an iPhone
it's<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.270> little<00:00:39.540> shorter<00:00:39.809> than<00:00:39.840> iPhone<00:00:40.290> it's<00:00:41.070> a

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
it's a little shorter than iPhone it's a

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.130 
it's a little shorter than iPhone it's a
little<00:00:41.340> bit<00:00:41.430> wider<00:00:41.610> than<00:00:41.879> an<00:00:41.969> iPhone<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.960> it's

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
little bit wider than an iPhone and it's

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.720 
little bit wider than an iPhone and it's
certainly<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.649> lot<00:00:43.860> thicker<00:00:44.100> than<00:00:44.340> an<00:00:44.430> iPhone

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
certainly a lot thicker than an iPhone

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.240 
certainly a lot thicker than an iPhone
but<00:00:45.390> it's<00:00:45.570> really<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.930> perfect<00:00:46.230> size<00:00:46.620> for<00:00:47.010> a
