00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
see you go to engage the torque tube and

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.500 
see you go to engage the torque tube and
here<00:02:15.470> we<00:02:15.560> go<00:02:15.740> with<00:02:16.120> hopefully<00:02:17.120> this<00:02:17.270> is<00:02:17.390> going

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
here we go with hopefully this is going

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.670 
here we go with hopefully this is going
to<00:02:17.600> be<00:02:17.720> relatively<00:02:18.650> low<00:02:19.040> maintenance<00:02:19.520> but

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
to be relatively low maintenance but

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.970 
to be relatively low maintenance but
down<00:02:21.680> here<00:02:21.980> I<00:02:22.010> don't<00:02:22.250> often<00:02:22.370> see<00:02:23.709> you<00:02:24.709> see<00:02:24.890> this

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
down here I don't often see you see this

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.070 
down here I don't often see you see this
right<00:02:25.190> here<00:02:25.600> the<00:02:26.600> tail<00:02:27.560> gears<00:02:27.830> are<00:02:28.070> or<00:02:28.670> jack

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
right here the tail gears are or jack

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.890 
right here the tail gears are or jack
but<00:02:30.080> I<00:02:30.190> mean<00:02:31.190> it<00:02:31.310> did<00:02:31.459> get<00:02:31.820> going<00:02:32.000> hard<00:02:32.330> my

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
but I mean it did get going hard my

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.110 
but I mean it did get going hard my
fault<00:02:33.940> you<00:02:34.940> fly<00:02:35.150> you<00:02:35.209> buy<00:02:35.480> but<00:02:36.110> I<00:02:36.940> think<00:02:37.940> what

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
fault you fly you buy but I think what

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.870 
fault you fly you buy but I think what
you<00:02:38.239> can<00:02:38.360> expect<00:02:39.310> definitely<00:02:40.310> stock<00:02:40.580> up<00:02:40.790> on

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
you can expect definitely stock up on

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.410 
you can expect definitely stock up on
these<00:02:41.030> blade<00:02:41.300> grips<00:02:41.600> and<00:02:41.930> canopies<00:02:42.410> and<00:02:43.420> the

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
these blade grips and canopies and the

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.890 
these blade grips and canopies and the
tailbone<00:02:45.050> definitely<00:02:46.010> these<00:02:46.100> gears<00:02:46.900> is

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
tailbone definitely these gears is

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.390 
tailbone definitely these gears is
that's<00:02:48.140> the<00:02:48.290> problem<00:02:49.040> in<00:02:49.160> the<00:02:49.220> future

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
that's the problem in the future

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.449 
that's the problem in the future
hopefully<00:02:50.239> we'll<00:02:50.630> see<00:02:50.840> somebody<00:02:51.500> like<00:02:51.560> micro

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
hopefully we'll see somebody like micro
