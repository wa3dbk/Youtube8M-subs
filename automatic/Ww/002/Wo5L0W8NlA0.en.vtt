00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.840
 alonso director of the anh 

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.850
 in this video I wanted to explain some 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.730
 issues regarding training 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:15.180
 knives of many of the schools that 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.180
 teach 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.740
 unfortunately with this bad knife not 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.050
 there are many people that really are 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.239
 professional but they have actually 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.789
 surrendered a little to the field without failing in 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:30.710
 this a mixture with respect to what 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:34.190
 is the knife and how do people really 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.860
 does not know and has no idea how is the 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.949
 work well prosecuted within this 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.900
 art here in the hands of a person who 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:45.309
 makes them believe that they are really having 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.309
 knife when it is not like that 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.719
 courses 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.640
 the vision 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.400
 for books it 's okay the question is 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.410
 why do they redesign this 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.410
 that is to be supposed to I 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.820
 those the effects of playing 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.340
 and the many videos of courses and things 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:29.070
 what is happening 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.070
 so they teach me this so that others 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.290
 Four. Five 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.680
 with work and all 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.050
 later they copy it annunciation 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:52.600
 we finished with that video 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:56.900
 for example ending in the column 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:59.300
 these shorts in order the examples can 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.580
 be many and very varied 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.890
 what it means for nice people 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.530
 is that if there is not a program behind 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.630
 but a way to chain all this and 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.069
 a way that has some coherence what 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.410
 what is being learned is a lot of 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.780
 nothing what I learn are others of 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.660
 loose techniques and not only later with 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.330
 the use of the knife 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.060
 I am a person who practices this 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.210
 another wine that people had 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.700
 they take out a little caucasia and actually 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.380
 they have nothing there is no program a 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.590
 system that does not have a program for 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:36.210
 subsist 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.490
 that evolves as it evolves 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.950
 if there is not a program we are a person 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.750
 very skilled is a very skilled person and that 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.450
 have very good simplifications facts 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.190
 for example is the case of thieves 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.080
 this occasion brings this search 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.760
 simplified to simplify the one that 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.490
 have known a lot and have trained 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.860
 the best teachers like the 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.140
 crisis school there is a simplified and 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.690
 here he has dedicated a lot that has happened 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.490
 I have and I remain the knife but for 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.860
 to be able to do all that has had to do 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.810
 a lot and based on this will simplify the 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.550
 we have simplifications of people who do not 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.620
 I understand nothing 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.480
 you understand people who do not train 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.970
 absolutely nothing then what 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.530
 we have to see when it's time to go 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.190
 to a seminar from a person who says 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.170
 be suitable in the art of the knife is 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.780
 really the person knows so that 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.270
 it deserves because it shows us this for what 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.640
 It serves me and if I'm going to show 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.540
 others we also do Cuba we explain you 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.540
 why 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:45.959
 we work as shepherds 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:50.150
 but passos and many everywhere 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:52.730
 160 that would start having another type 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.500
 applications and not just an exercise 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.530
 machining where I do not even understand 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.830
 what am I doing 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:02.530
 I hope it will help you clarify the 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.360
 people who still do not know the knife 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.860
 who unfortunately believes that he is 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.290
 taking into account let's go when in 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.569
 actually entering you're going back to 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.510
 repeat the techniques have to have 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.160
 some foundation if I'm doing the 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.540
 teak company blue or is working that 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.180
 spend them on making a foundation 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.010
 there must be something behind 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.020
 after the exercise if not what I am 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.120
 doing is an isolated exercise or 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.180
 messy that will not serve me for 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.639
 nothing because I do not know the rest nor in 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.830
 depth 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.419
 well I hope that this video serves to 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.249
 clarify I repeat the same thing about 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.650
 I will always find it to none 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:40.469
 person only in defense of the 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.240
 person they consume in practice and 

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:44.219
 that unfortunately is deceived by 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.319
 people who know they are not professional and 

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:50.180
 he lies to the people he 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:50.180
 instruct many thanks to all
