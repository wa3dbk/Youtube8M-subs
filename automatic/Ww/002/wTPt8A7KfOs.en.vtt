to you know six months map to the bottle

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.270 
to you know six months map to the bottle
this<00:02:15.959> is<00:02:16.079> great<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.470> mean<00:02:16.650> I'm<00:02:16.769> super<00:02:17.129> pumped

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
this is great I mean I'm super pumped

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.860 
this is great I mean I'm super pumped
with<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:17.610> quality<00:02:18.030> of<00:02:18.209> this<00:02:18.329> fruit<00:02:18.540> and<00:02:18.750> I'm

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
with the quality of this fruit and I'm

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.979 
with the quality of this fruit and I'm
I've<00:02:19.799> never<00:02:20.069> used<00:02:20.609> it<00:02:20.880> before<00:02:21.000> so<00:02:21.510> I'm<00:02:21.720> ready

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
I've never used it before so I'm ready

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.699 
I've never used it before so I'm ready
to<00:02:22.109> get<00:02:22.230> going<00:02:22.260> on<00:02:22.590> there<00:02:22.769> you<00:02:22.889> go

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
to get going on there you go

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.960 
to get going on there you go
so<00:02:25.709> when<00:02:26.190> are<00:02:26.250> we<00:02:26.280> going<00:02:26.459> to<00:02:26.520> get<00:02:26.610> that<00:02:26.790> nice

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
so when are we going to get that nice

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.210 
so when are we going to get that nice
and<00:02:27.300> nice<00:02:27.690> and<00:02:27.959> pink<00:02:28.170> tup<00:02:28.470> because<00:02:28.920> what<00:02:29.069> this

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
and nice and pink tup because what this

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.479 
and nice and pink tup because what this
does<00:02:29.520> one<00:02:30.180> it<00:02:30.390> gives<00:02:30.599> sugar<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:31.890> water<00:02:32.220> so

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
does one it gives sugar to the water so

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.520 
does one it gives sugar to the water so
it<00:02:32.610> gets<00:02:32.819> the<00:02:33.060> East<00:02:33.270> kind<00:02:33.480> of<00:02:33.599> warmed<00:02:33.840> up<00:02:33.959> plus

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
it gets the East kind of warmed up plus

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.320 
it gets the East kind of warmed up plus
it's<00:02:35.160> got<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.430> temperature<00:02:35.849> of<00:02:35.940> what<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.180> bin

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
it's got the temperature of what the bin

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.059 
it's got the temperature of what the bin
is<00:02:36.360> at<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:36.870> it's<00:02:37.140> going<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.290> acclimate<00:02:37.950> the

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
is at and it's going to acclimate the

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.110 
is at and it's going to acclimate the
yeast<00:02:38.280> in<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.520> environment<00:02:38.760> that<00:02:38.970> we're

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
yeast in the environment that we're

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.729 
yeast in the environment that we're
going<00:02:39.239> to<00:02:39.300> be<00:02:39.390> putting<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.810> very<00:02:40.170> coolness<00:02:40.620> i

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
going to be putting the very coolness i

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.589 
going to be putting the very coolness i
did<00:02:40.860> i<00:02:40.980> did<00:02:41.099> not<00:02:41.280> know<00:02:41.340> that<00:02:41.489> so<00:02:41.970> what<00:02:42.480> I<00:02:42.510> need

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
grow and don't start to acclimate to its

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:37.979 
grow and don't start to acclimate to its
new<00:03:36.760> environment<00:03:36.909> which<00:03:37.629> is<00:03:37.750> all<00:03:37.870> this

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
new environment which is all this

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.530 
new environment which is all this
delicious<00:03:38.500> sweet<00:03:39.430> juice<00:03:39.730> with<00:03:40.120> a<00:03:40.150> lot<00:03:40.359> of

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
delicious sweet juice with a lot of

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.809 
delicious sweet juice with a lot of
sugar<00:03:40.689> in<00:03:40.840> there<00:03:41.140> and<00:03:41.439> the<00:03:42.219> temperature<00:03:42.670> is<00:03:42.700> a

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
sugar in there and the temperature is a

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:44.190 
sugar in there and the temperature is a
little<00:03:43.090> cool<00:03:43.269> right<00:03:43.480> now<00:03:43.510> but<00:03:43.689> as

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
little cool right now but as

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.679 
little cool right now but as
fermentation<00:03:44.560> starts<00:03:45.129> and<00:03:45.489> it<00:03:45.939> generates<00:03:46.359> the

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:46.689 
fermentation starts and it generates the

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:48.929 
fermentation starts and it generates the
carbon<00:03:47.260> dioxide<00:03:47.709> it<00:03:48.129> gets<00:03:48.340> converts<00:03:48.670> the

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:48.939 
carbon dioxide it gets converts the
