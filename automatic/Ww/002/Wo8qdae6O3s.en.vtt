they light up such a massive area you

as<00:02:07.220> the<00:02:07.580> game<00:02:08.210> puts<00:02:08.510> in<00:02:08.690> and<00:02:08.840> you<00:02:08.899> can<00:02:09.050> see<00:02:09.229> here

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
as the game puts in and you can see here

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.080 
as the game puts in and you can see here
I<00:02:09.500> make<00:02:09.770> it<00:02:09.950> I've<00:02:10.130> over<00:02:10.610> stopped<00:02:10.910> on<00:02:11.060> the

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
I make it I've over stopped on the

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.330 
I make it I've over stopped on the
capacitors<00:02:11.720> but<00:02:11.960> actually<00:02:12.650> my<00:02:12.800> power

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
capacitors but actually my power

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.250 
capacitors but actually my power
stations<00:02:13.700> not<00:02:13.880> really<00:02:14.270> running<00:02:14.510> at<00:02:14.870> a<00:02:15.080> high

stations not really running at a high
temperature<00:02:15.440> at<00:02:15.860> all<00:02:16.010> so<00:02:16.340> I'm<00:02:16.910> thinking

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
temperature at all so I'm thinking

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.810 
temperature at all so I'm thinking
that's<00:02:17.990> good<00:02:18.410> for<00:02:18.710> handling<00:02:19.160> fires<00:02:19.490> in<00:02:19.790> the

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
that's good for handling fires in the

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.970 
that's good for handling fires in the
long<00:02:20.060> run<00:02:20.090> and<00:02:21.050> I<00:02:21.140> have<00:02:21.170> heard<00:02:21.500> rumor<00:02:21.830> that

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
long run and I have heard rumor that

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.880 
long run and I have heard rumor that
that<00:02:22.670> is<00:02:22.820> an<00:02:23.000> important<00:02:23.540> way<00:02:24.080> to<00:02:24.140> stop<00:02:24.530> the

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
that is an important way to stop the

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.620 
that is an important way to stop the
fires<00:02:25.160> coming<00:02:25.310> in<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:25.790> long<00:02:25.970> run<00:02:28.420> right<00:02:29.420> so

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
fires coming in the long run right so

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.509 
can see I've made the deliveries area
larger<00:03:24.260> but<00:03:24.410> I've<00:03:24.500> also<00:03:24.650> pulled<00:03:25.040> it<00:03:25.160> back<00:03:25.190> from

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
larger but I've also pulled it back from

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.610 
larger but I've also pulled it back from
the<00:03:25.610> road<00:03:25.790> so<00:03:26.390> when<00:03:26.660> you're<00:03:26.930> out<00:03:27.080> at<00:03:27.320> a<00:03:27.410> point

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
the road so when you're out at a point

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.380 
the road so when you're out at a point
where<00:03:27.769> you've<00:03:28.100> got<00:03:28.280> no<00:03:28.430> money<00:03:28.670> like<00:03:28.910> I<00:03:29.090> have

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
where you've got no money like I have

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.280 
where you've got no money like I have
and<00:03:29.600> you're<00:03:30.410> you've<00:03:31.239> you've<00:03:32.239> built<00:03:32.690> as<00:03:32.900> many

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
and you're you've you've built as many

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.250 
and you're you've you've built as many
cells<00:03:33.650> as<00:03:34.040> you<00:03:34.220> have<00:03:34.400> prisoners<00:03:34.900> you<00:03:35.900> can't

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
cells as you have prisoners you can't

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.259 
cells as you have prisoners you can't
really<00:03:36.560> accept<00:03:37.250> any<00:03:37.550> more<00:03:37.730> prisoners<00:03:38.120> then

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
really accept any more prisoners then

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.660 
really accept any more prisoners then
because<00:03:38.450> it<00:03:38.570> would<00:03:38.690> just<00:03:38.930> be<00:03:39.140> too<00:03:39.320> much<00:03:39.640> what<00:03:40.640> I

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
because it would just be too much what I

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.870 
because it would just be too much what I
do<00:03:40.820> is<00:03:41.030> I<00:03:41.500> downsize<00:03:42.500> my<00:03:42.530> deliveries<00:03:43.220> area<00:03:43.550> take

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
do is I downsize my deliveries area take

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.729 
do is I downsize my deliveries area take
it<00:03:44.000> away<00:03:44.060> from<00:03:44.239> the<00:03:44.510> road<00:03:44.690> here<00:03:44.989> so<00:03:45.440> if<00:03:45.500> we<00:03:45.590> go

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
it away from the road here so if we go

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.170 
it away from the road here so if we go
into<00:03:45.860> the<00:03:46.070> liveries<00:03:46.400> we<00:03:46.610> can<00:03:46.790> expand<00:03:47.330> it<00:03:47.450> again

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
into the liveries we can expand it again

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.240 
into the liveries we can expand it again
simply<00:03:48.599> highlighting<00:03:48.959> out<00:03:49.230> here<00:03:49.469> and<00:03:49.650> the

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
simply highlighting out here and the

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.309

prisoners<00:03:50.700> will<00:03:50.879> be<00:03:51.030> dropped<00:03:51.269> off<00:03:51.450> but<00:03:51.750> if<00:03:52.019> you

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
prisoners will be dropped off but if you

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.339 
prisoners will be dropped off but if you
do<00:03:52.560> this<00:03:53.180> right-click<00:03:54.180> will<00:03:54.840> hold<00:03:55.079> down<00:03:55.230> the

right mouse button and gets rid of that

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.339 
right mouse button and gets rid of that
little<00:03:57.030> area<00:03:57.239> of<00:03:57.480> deliveries<00:03:57.930> and<00:03:58.230> the

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
little area of deliveries and the

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:59.839 
little area of deliveries and the
prisoners<00:03:58.769> don't<00:03:58.950> actually<00:03:59.129> get<00:03:59.459> dropped<00:03:59.730> off

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
prisoners don't actually get dropped off

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:01.759 
prisoners don't actually get dropped off
they<00:04:00.060> just<00:04:00.269> carry<00:04:00.480> on<00:04:00.569> driver<00:04:00.930> so<00:04:01.500> it's<00:04:01.620> a<00:04:01.680> good

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
they just carry on driver so it's a good

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.160 
they just carry on driver so it's a good
way<00:04:01.950> of<00:04:02.030> stalling<00:04:03.030> their<00:04:03.780> prisoner

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
way of stalling their prisoner

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.470 
way of stalling their prisoner
deliveries<00:04:04.680> so<00:04:04.920> that<00:04:05.099> you<00:04:05.189> can<00:04:05.400> get<00:04:06.329> the

deliveries so that you can get the

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.690 
deliveries so that you can get the
