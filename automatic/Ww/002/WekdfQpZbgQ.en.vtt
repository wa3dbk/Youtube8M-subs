 Hello dear friends with you I am Yuri 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.759
 axenov is the gameplay and today we 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:10.309
 look at four toys on our 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.309
 good long traditions today will be 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:15.330
 Hello dear friends with you I am Yuri 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.119
 Axenov this gameplay today on our 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.810
 good old traditions we look at 4 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.570
 android games 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.090
 and today we're picking up the models and more 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.890
 chop off our fingers but a couple more 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.349
 games will be well, what are the first game 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.300
 called man'sa this game in which you 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.189
 it is necessary to collect models 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.710
 but only one model is available here. 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.940
 free all other kit and you 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.640
 will have to buy 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.980
 inside the game there are a lot of them 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.920
 quantity but they cost enough 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.620
 expensive probably better go buy kits 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.180
 From plastic most these toys glue 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.860
 but the toy is pretty good 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.510
 interesting and I think she will win many and 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.879
 conquers and many will want all the same 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.340
 play even here in the test suite where 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.989
 need to assemble a sports car and so 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.770
 all you need to do first open 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.960
 instruction 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.450
 and after that we can already collect 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.670
 here we are all shown in what order and 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.670
 what parts where to attach that is 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.140
 we get the part and attach it as 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.299
 you see the level of graphics in the game 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.680
 cool enough everything in 3d can be rotated 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.479
 zoom in and generally do all that 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.250
 just like you probably in real 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:28.530
 life of course when are you going to 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.920
 Reale is much more interesting but even 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.759
 Despite this, I was personally very 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.680
 very interesting to play this game so 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.900
 get up eat everything a after you 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.000
 collected all that was needed on the first 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.869
 sheet just turn the page and 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.950
 continue to build the necessary parts 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.350
 are highlighted and you just need them 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.930
 put in the right places of course 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.939
 it would be more interesting if the instructions were not 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.670
 was because it would then collect 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.950
 everything would be much more problematic more difficult but it 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.259
 probably added some kind of hardcore 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.549
 toys toy is very high quality and 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.969
 very interesting and everyone who loves 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:09.360
 designers run download play but to 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:11.370
 Unfortunately, not just one set 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.870
 the second game is called speed idol 3d 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.239
 here you can select all 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.190
 Type that is a skin but it is different such 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.250
 Here is the graphic design but in principle 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.049
 they have no load for you 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.049
 bring push start management 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.970
 something with tapas and you need 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:29.879
 manage this here is a bundle of light 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.760
 which moves on some bright 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:34.950
 light path using something to the right you 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.170
 turn right with steps 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.940
 to the left turns relo and very here in 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.370
 such a spirit to play the only thing 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.959
 confuses me in this game is music she 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.720
 for some reason reminds me very much 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.780
 music creativity group butyrka type 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.239
 there was a smell of spring blizzards hang up and stuff 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.370
 to whom the music from this game reminds 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:57.239
 butyryku put a finger top who 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.040
 watched clips group butyrka and respects and 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.849
 love this group in general something i 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.069
 broke up 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.799
 the toy itself is not bad at all 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:07.170
 reminds fedex 3d but a little bit with 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.870
 another implementation but with enough 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.670
 nice visual design and here 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.530
 she is a mega hardcore game in which you 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.200
 be able to chop off your fingers called 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.970
 to the timber concert and in this game you what 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.419
 need to do need to tap on 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:24.299
 the screen at the moment when these are all 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:27.209
 dots will pass over the line if you remember 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.340
 at the wrong moment you risk chopping off 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.639
 your fingers in this and that hardcore 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:36.060
 general toy is the successor 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:38.459
 traditions 1 tobacco games 1 tobacco pancakes 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.109
 what i say games in which you need 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.810
 make just one click then 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:44.940
 There is a press xtu in and, accordingly, you need 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.129
 just tap at the right moments and then 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.769
 you can set your record my 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:51.739
 record for the moment 7 it caused u 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:55.139
 I have enough difficulty so much 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:57.150
 nastrogat but look damn again 7 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:59.609
 and the last game is called djir to appear 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.440
 my camera runs out of memory maybe 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:03.329
 now i'm gone let's take a look at 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.519
 this puzzle 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:08.699
 what to do here and here to you 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.209
 you need to rotate the gears and so 

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:11.519
 the most 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:14.519
 complete the level and get to the portal 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:16.079
 orange spikes as you see disappear and 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.160
 you can wait for the right moment 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.250
 to go through 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.250
 pressing the white button you remove the white 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.220
 spikes and thereby free your way 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.400
 after that we wait again 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:31.040
 disappears orange and successfully complete 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.320
 mission further mission will be even more difficult 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.080
 I didn't like hardcore yet 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.420
 the design of the game is quite simple but with 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.880
 Taste I would say to play like this 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:43.430
 interesting game mega hardcore if 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:47.410
 at first everything will be easy enough then 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:49.700
 then you will just burn 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.600
 one place because you will 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.030
 to get tired 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.590
 and play well for today all 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.780
 Thank you all for your attention 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.600
 subscribe to the channel put your finger 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:02.650

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.650
 I did not run out of memory
