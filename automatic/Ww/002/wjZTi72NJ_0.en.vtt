to<00:00:57.190> do<00:00:57.339> they<00:00:57.369> followed<00:00:58.239> the<00:00:58.330> game<00:00:58.510> plan<00:00:58.780> I

00:00:59.039 --> 00:00:59.049 
to do they followed the game plan I

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:02.009 
to do they followed the game plan I
thought<00:00:59.500> they<00:00:59.619> fought<00:00:59.890> hard<00:01:00.159> and<00:01:01.059> I<00:01:01.780> thought

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:02.019 
thought they fought hard and I thought

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:05.130 
thought they fought hard and I thought
we<00:01:02.170> score<00:01:02.619> two<00:01:02.799> great<00:01:03.010> goals<00:01:03.900> you<00:01:04.900> know<00:01:04.930> the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
only disappointing part was I thought we

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.899 
only disappointing part was I thought we
gave<00:01:08.200> up<00:01:08.350> a<00:01:08.439> couple<00:01:08.470> soft<00:01:08.920> goals<00:01:09.130> we<00:01:09.460> did
