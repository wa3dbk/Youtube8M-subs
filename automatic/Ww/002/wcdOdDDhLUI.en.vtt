00:00:06.416 --> 00:00:09.883
 Hi, with you "Just like a beast," the program is about who people are like. 

00:00:09.883 --> 00:00:12.512
 And today it is Oryctolagus cuniculus Totoshka, 

00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:15.452
 and I, Zhenya Timonova, give him every support in this. 

00:00:15.822 --> 00:00:19.884
 Last time we talked about the most severe period in the life of animals, about childhood. 

00:00:19.884 --> 00:00:22.658
 The young sacrifice in danger, they can be eaten in hunger, 

00:00:22.658 --> 00:00:26.517
 they are trapped during migrations, they are killed during genetic conflicts, 

00:00:26.517 --> 00:00:29.487
 Yes, and they can just hit, just so that it does not turn around here. 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.509
 Animals, especially animals of mass breeding, do not stand on ceremony with cubs: 

00:00:33.685 --> 00:00:36.835
 It is always easier to give birth to new ones than to launder these. 

00:00:37.238 --> 00:00:39.668
 We, the people, can not afford this. 

00:00:39.811 --> 00:00:41.501
 But not because we are so good 

00:00:41.501 --> 00:00:45.076
 but because our children, our young ones, 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.765
 they are not only the most expensive and hard-to-live in the world, 

00:00:48.765 --> 00:00:50.635
 but also the smartest. 

00:00:51.044 --> 00:00:54.044
 And so they twist as human adults as they want. 

00:00:54.284 --> 00:00:58.280
 Yes, good grandfather Natural Selection gave good kids a lot of ways 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.440
 reinforce the desired adult behavior and prevent unwanted. 

00:01:03.351 --> 00:01:05.663
 In fact, children behave like parasites, 

00:01:05.663 --> 00:01:10.260
 if you remember our wonderful release about parasitic neuroprogramming. 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.887
 They learned simply to brilliantly manipulate adults, 

00:01:12.887 --> 00:01:14.919
 moreover they make it so thin 

00:01:14.919 --> 00:01:17.931
 that even the very thought of the manipulative nature of children's behavior 

00:01:17.931 --> 00:01:20.341
 You have a deep protest. 

00:01:20.843 --> 00:01:24.049
 Here, in fact, like that of a caterpillar with rider's cocoons: 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.255
 "How can you, children - is holy!" 

00:01:26.255 --> 00:01:28.495
 Well, firstly, the saint must somehow survive. 

00:01:28.495 --> 00:01:31.925
 And secondly, they became holy, by evolutionary standards, just yesterday. 

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:37.453
 And before that, they were just hard-hitting and sooo long maturing babies, 

00:01:37.453 --> 00:01:42.054
 of which only those few survived who knew how to bend this world under themselves 

00:01:42.054 --> 00:01:44.696
 and pass on this quality to your children. 

00:01:44.836 --> 00:01:47.354
 So, born of evolution, simple but reliable, 

00:01:47.354 --> 00:01:48.812
 mechanisms of taming adults. 

00:01:48.812 --> 00:01:49.542
 The first. 

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:53.666
 In order not to be eaten and left you, you have to become very, very cute. 

00:01:53.666 --> 00:01:57.428
 Human babies have a much thicker fat layer 

00:01:57.428 --> 00:01:59.300
 than, for example, young monkeys. 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.300
 That is, it was not enough for your mother that you have such a huge head, 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.470
 you also, fat! 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:10.575
 Chubby whole! Chubby ... What cheeks, knobs with peretezhechkami, Uchi-way! 

00:02:10.575 --> 00:02:15.243
 Infants benefit from being plump, because moms like plump babies. 

00:02:15.243 --> 00:02:19.674
 And in general, the whole baby-shape: a big head, big eyes, 

00:02:19.674 --> 00:02:23.825
 rounded shape - it very successfully blocks aggressive impulses in adults 

00:02:23.825 --> 00:02:28.973
 and, on the contrary, causes the desire to press, warm, feed ... 

00:02:28.973 --> 00:02:30.243
 And in general, the plan works. 

00:02:30.243 --> 00:02:33.825
 But so that mom can deal with you all the time, you also need a dad. 

00:02:33.825 --> 00:02:37.395
 And dad also needs to activate his parental instinct. 

00:02:37.395 --> 00:02:40.758
 The vast majority of babies after birth are like fathers. 

00:02:40.758 --> 00:02:45.085
 Then it can change, but first it should be clear: "Whose child?" - "My child!" 

00:02:45.085 --> 00:02:47.125
 Emotional reinforcement. 

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:48.891
 Smile baby 

00:02:48.891 --> 00:02:53.149
 Especially the one that turns parents into a puddle of syrup. 

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:56.222
 At first, babies smile at everyone around them. 

00:02:56.222 --> 00:02:59.508
 Yes that people, in fact, even the ball with painted eyes and mouth 

00:02:59.508 --> 00:03:00.705
 they will smile too. 

00:03:00.705 --> 00:03:03.404
 The task of the stage here is this carpet bombing - 

00:03:03.404 --> 00:03:07.454
 strike and calm all surrounding adult power. 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:11.087
 And then he will shoot and will act more selectively: 

00:03:11.087 --> 00:03:15.297
 the world will be divided into friends and foes, and the mimimins will be foreshadowed only by their own. 

00:03:15.298 --> 00:03:16.688
 Sorry, the ball! .. 

00:03:16.688 --> 00:03:17.961
 Hormonal reinforcement. 

00:03:17.961 --> 00:03:22.347
 In fact, the female breast is not the most convenient thing to feed, as it is intended ... 

00:03:22.347 --> 00:03:23.917
 not just for feeding. 

00:03:24.141 --> 00:03:29.881
 She climbs the baby in the nose, interferes with breathing, feeding is delayed, and everything would be terrible, 

00:03:29.883 --> 00:03:34.308
 if in its process oxytocin was not produced - 

00:03:34.308 --> 00:03:36.168
 hormone that stimulates maternal love, 

00:03:36.168 --> 00:03:40.771
 and prolactin, a hormone that disables the female brain. 

00:03:40.771 --> 00:03:44.763
 This is the question of how in just a few weeks, 

00:03:44.763 --> 00:03:51.193
 Madam President of the International Corporation is turning into Mrs. We Poured. 

00:03:51.193 --> 00:03:53.983
 Because the main principle of successful parasitism: 

00:03:53.983 --> 00:03:58.863
 "If you want someone elseâ€™s body to take care of you, share resources with you, 

00:03:58.863 --> 00:04:02.342
 you have to change his mind. " 

00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:06.734
 But if evolutionarily successful children are children who like their parents, 

00:04:06.734 --> 00:04:10.186
 then where do these terrible teenagers, who simply enrage everyone, come from? 

00:04:10.186 --> 00:04:13.418
 There is a hypothesis that since puberty 

00:04:13.418 --> 00:04:16.368
 the character and appearance of adolescents spoil in order 

00:04:16.372 --> 00:04:21.092
 to avoid genetically fraught with closely related crossbreeding. 

00:04:21.092 --> 00:04:25.484
 That is, children must be nice to be cared for, and teenagers 

00:04:25.484 --> 00:04:29.342
 should become nasty so that they are not ... In general, so that they are not bothered. 

00:04:30.082 --> 00:04:33.962
 By the way, a special talent for manipulation when parents literally twist the rope - 

00:04:33.962 --> 00:04:37.692
 This is a gain in tactics, but a loss in strategy. 

00:04:37.692 --> 00:04:40.577
 Yes, you will spend your childhood well, but your children, 

00:04:40.577 --> 00:04:44.419
 to whom you pass this ability, they, too, will come off on you to the fullest. 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:46.969
 That's why we love our grandchildren so much - 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:49.489
 they will avenge our children for us. 

00:04:49.579 --> 00:04:51.996
 With you it was "Just like a beast," bye!
