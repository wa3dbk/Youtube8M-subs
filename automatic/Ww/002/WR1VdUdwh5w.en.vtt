Superbike<00:02:01.380> racing<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:01.920> it's<00:02:02.100> got<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.219> very<00:02:02.520> high

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
Superbike racing so it's got a very high

what<00:02:05.939> you're<00:02:06.030> going<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.210> find<00:02:06.420> out<00:02:06.479> this<00:02:06.570> tire

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
what you're going to find out this tire

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.589 
what you're going to find out this tire
is<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.920> profile<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:09.000> tread<00:02:09.390> compound

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
is that the profile the tread compound

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.479 
is that the profile the tread compound
and<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.379> zero<00:02:10.590> Degree<00:02:10.890> belts<00:02:11.190> we<00:02:11.280> talked

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
and the zero Degree belts we talked

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.820 
and the zero Degree belts we talked
about<00:02:11.610> all<00:02:11.910> of<00:02:12.150> those<00:02:12.300> go<00:02:12.569> into<00:02:13.020> the

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
about all of those go into the

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.010 
about all of those go into the
enhanced<00:02:14.100> patch<00:02:14.370> technology<00:02:15.060> so<00:02:15.270> basically

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
enhanced patch technology so basically

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.630 
enhanced patch technology so basically
no<00:02:16.140> matter<00:02:16.230> where<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.710> tire<00:02:16.950> is<00:02:17.100> at<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.490> it's

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
no matter where the tire is at and it's

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.580 
no matter where the tire is at and it's
lean<00:02:17.910> angle<00:02:18.120> it's<00:02:18.600> going<00:02:18.720> to<00:02:18.780> have<00:02:18.900> as<00:02:19.020> much<00:02:19.350> of

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
lean angle it's going to have as much of

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.320 
lean angle it's going to have as much of
a<00:02:19.740> contact<00:02:20.190> patch<00:02:20.370> as<00:02:20.580> possible<00:02:21.030> giving<00:02:21.240> the

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
a contact patch as possible giving the

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.870 
a contact patch as possible giving the
maximum<00:02:21.720> performance<00:02:21.870> so<00:02:22.500> high<00:02:23.400> silica

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
maximum performance so high silica
