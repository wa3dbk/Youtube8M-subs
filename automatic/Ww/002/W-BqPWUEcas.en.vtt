00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 fundamental is the issue of teaching 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.790
 superior in regard to life 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.860
 academic life of the institution is 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.460
 the way we deal with the 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.130
 knowledge that in our tradition has 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.279
 been a great way to see the 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.490
 knowledge as a mere representation 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:26.250
 and I will insist is that in fact we 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.580
 we need to conceive it as a process 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:33.649
 the construction of the objects that we 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.920
 we want to know or need to know 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:40.980
 transforming the investigative and 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:44.100
 research as the basis of the 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.430
 our pedagogical didactic procedure 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.800
 I'm crying, you see this with maybe one of the 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.500
 problems of teaching because 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.840
 students often do not understand 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.460
 that this process of knowledge of 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.309
 search it is a pedagogical process 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.230
 I also do not associate research that this 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.989
 can be a serious problem not then I 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.470
 I think that entering walls is the main 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.470
 problem as I intend it too 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.500
 there are other problems that 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.070
 afflict Brazilian higher education but 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.820
 It is society's problems that are 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:24.140
 outside the doors of the institutions of 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.420
 but here in the academic process the 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.630
 our Achilles heel is precisely 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.689
 This is what the expectation of the student 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.840
 students do not come is not to 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.860
 university with this mentality of 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.829
 he only learns by building knowledge 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:48.090
 and there he is very much in expectation of the 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:50.909
 finished product and and instead of 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.420
 of the production process of the 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:58.079
 knowledge is what generates this 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.700
 apparent dichotomy of this difficulty and 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.630
 impasses all that we are 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.189
 facing 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.240
 and you can solve to give to stimulate 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.540
 This research search is 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.780
 r is such a story is not this is one in 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.370
 pedagogical revolution and we are 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.130
 needing 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:19.239
 it is not done even in the short term 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:21.790
 not a single segment of education is 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:25.060
 a mentality that needs to be changed 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:28.590
 there are now in each of the stages that we 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.900
 find ourselves we must insist is there 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:35.440
 if you collect from the university student, 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.480
 and look for a didactic process that 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.080
 wake up a little to this perspective 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.450
 that changing people needs to change this 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.220
 way of conceiving the knowledge and 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.390
 consequently the way of conceiving 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.390
 learning too
