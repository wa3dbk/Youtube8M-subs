00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.909

 the protests that took over the country 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.599

 background good evening rio grande do sul eu 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.840
 I believe that when we have a 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.349
 problem the first solution is to recognize 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.780
 it 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.940
 the Brazilian went ahead he took a 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.459
 attitude I'm very proud to be

 to see this is in the finalist and mine 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:07.340
 question is over the years of the past 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:11.150
 years the Brazilian states did not 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.459
 economic and political positions. 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.540
 on the national scene 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:21.140
 do you believe that a south is woking 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:24.340
 gained in its representativeness before 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.340

 good the southern big river is a state 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:40.519
 very strong and because of this he comes 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:44.590
 growing more and more on the scene 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:49.430
 showing that the people of Rio Grande do Sul 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:51.910
 can rather build an evolved state and 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.650
 very very strong even 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.870
 regardless of anything 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.200
 Happen to the joke 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.510
 Thank you my same new piratini 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:06.019
 hamburg two envelopes remain 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.579
 finalists two questions and what does the 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:10.700
 ask now is the juror carmen flores 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:12.410
 Your question meat, good night 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.740
 Hamburg 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:18.920
 do you think that the education of a 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:21.920
 adopted by a gay couple is 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:24.200
 different from the creation of a couple 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.660
 heterosexual 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.120
 Good night, Carmen, good night to everyone. 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.440
 juries and a special year my beloved river 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.600
 great southern 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.230
 well I believe that the education of a 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:38.990
 child is not directly linked to the 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:41.600
 sexual choice of their parents, but 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.540
 education that they will give her also the 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.820
 culture of which the parents live the character 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.890
 that they will pass on to that child and 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:52.040
 also the child they are going to 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:57.050
 for this child then certainly not 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:05:01.160
 is not a synonym for difference is not 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:04.460
 one is not a difference when they are couples 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:07.550
 straight or homosexual 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.620
 thank you same new hamburg and the last 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.390
 right to answer my hopes 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.370
 Let's find out who the jury is for 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.600
 ask you guys will you rodrigues for 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.600
 please ask your question 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:24.909
 is now waiting for you is and congratulations 

00:05:22.209 --> 00:05:25.989
 do you think the arrest of those involved in the 

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:27.309
 monthly 

00:05:25.989 --> 00:05:29.769
 changes the history of Brazilian justice 

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:32.800
 it is not just an isolated case 

00:05:29.769 --> 00:05:34.300
 hello, good night, background. Good night. 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.119
 Rio Grande do Sul 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.580
 so that's right this question I 

00:05:37.119 --> 00:05:42.369
 I believe that the stresses involved 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:45.459
 rather than imprisonment of those involved 

00:05:42.369 --> 00:05:48.989
 in the mensalão was a milestone 

00:05:45.459 --> 00:05:52.569
 important in law and I believe that 

00:05:48.989 --> 00:05:56.800
 this is one of the solutions to 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:58.869
 into the mistakes our country 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.059
 thank you and good night, thank you 

00:05:58.869 --> 00:06:03.339
 Renata 

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:07.499
