00:00:00.332 --> 00:00:01.832
 Subtitled by FreddyKrugger! 

00:00:19.783 --> 00:00:21.652
 Another dream that will never come true 

00:00:21.652 --> 00:00:24.131
 Just to increase your pain 

00:00:24.571 --> 00:00:26.554
 Another life that I have taken from you 

00:00:26.554 --> 00:00:29.317
 A gift to add to your pain and suffering 

00:00:29.526 --> 00:00:31.367
 Another truth that you can never believe 

00:00:31.367 --> 00:00:33.785
 It has completely invalidated you 

00:00:34.255 --> 00:00:36.317
 All the screams that you start to hear 

00:00:36.535 --> 00:00:39.203
 Trapped in your mind and the sound is deafening 

00:00:41.464 --> 00:00:44.705
 Let me enlighten you 

00:00:46.283 --> 00:00:50.714
 This is the way I pray 

00:00:51.086 --> 00:00:55.506
 The sky is not hot enough 

00:00:55.985 --> 00:01:00.430
 Burn me alive inside 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.317
 Living my life is not difficult enough 

00:01:05.674 --> 00:01:07.114
 Take everything 

00:01:22.856 --> 00:01:24.677
 Another nightmare about to come true 

00:01:24.677 --> 00:01:27.176
 It will manifest tomorrow 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.613
 Another love that I have taken from you 

00:01:29.844 --> 00:01:32.342
 Lost in time, on the verge of suffering 

00:01:32.556 --> 00:01:34.432
 Another proof of the evil I spawn 

00:01:34.432 --> 00:01:36.804
 It will level you completely 

00:01:37.348 --> 00:01:39.374
 Relive everything you fear 

00:01:39.374 --> 00:01:42.244
 Live in the dark, and the world is threatening 

00:01:44.477 --> 00:01:47.674
 Let me enlighten you 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.819
 This is the way I pray 

00:01:54.136 --> 00:01:58.475
 The sky is not hot enough 

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:03.718
 Burn me alive inside 

00:02:03.718 --> 00:02:08.156
 Living my life is not difficult enough 

00:02:08.562 --> 00:02:10.002
 Take everything 

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:31.154
 Back to me 

00:02:31.384 --> 00:02:32.070
 Back to me 

00:02:32.307 --> 00:02:33.011
 Back to me 

00:02:33.244 --> 00:02:33.913
 Come to me 

00:02:34.145 --> 00:02:35.346
 Do not leave me to anyone 

00:02:35.586 --> 00:02:36.208
 Come to me 

00:02:36.208 --> 00:02:37.034
 Back to me 

00:02:37.034 --> 00:02:37.924
 Back to me 

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:38.861
 Come to me 

00:02:38.861 --> 00:02:40.260
 Stand aside! 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.028
 Back to me 

00:02:41.028 --> 00:02:41.791
 Back to me 

00:02:41.791 --> 00:02:42.650
 Back to me 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.572
 Come to me 

00:02:43.818 --> 00:02:44.971
 Do not leave me to anyone 

00:02:45.214 --> 00:02:45.806
 Come to me 

00:02:45.806 --> 00:02:46.614
 Back to me 

00:02:46.614 --> 00:02:47.469
 Back to me 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.838
 you made me go 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.696
 The sky is not hot enough 

00:02:57.062 --> 00:03:01.684
 Burn me alive inside 

00:03:01.944 --> 00:03:06.287
 Living my life is not difficult enough 

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:11.337
 They took everything from you 

00:03:11.664 --> 00:03:16.026
 The sky is not hot enough 

00:03:16.474 --> 00:03:21.024
 Burn me alive inside 

00:03:21.337 --> 00:03:26.000
 Living my life is not difficult enough 

00:03:26.251 --> 00:03:27.691
 Take everything
