this is really cool ok it must be fun to

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.610 
this is really cool ok it must be fun to
jump<00:02:23.989> start<00:02:26.019> that's<00:02:27.019> just<00:02:27.110> some<00:02:27.290> car<00:02:27.470> humor

which<00:02:28.310> I'm<00:02:28.459> starting<00:02:28.790> it<00:02:28.880> we're<00:02:29.570> gonna<00:02:29.690> check

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
which I'm starting it we're gonna check

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.310 
which I'm starting it we're gonna check
out<00:02:30.019> under<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.410> hood<00:02:31.480> yes<00:02:32.480> it's<00:02:33.079> going<00:02:33.200> to<00:02:33.230> be

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
out under the hood yes it's going to be

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.860

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
that's really eco is so eco there's no

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.480 
that's really eco is so eco there's no
engine<00:02:42.030> now<00:02:42.270> what's<00:02:42.540> going<00:02:42.780> on<00:02:42.900> it's<00:02:43.560> design

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
engine now what's going on it's design

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.310 
engine now what's going on it's design
for<00:02:44.760> drag<00:02:44.940> racing<00:02:45.210> so<00:02:45.600> right<00:02:45.810> now<00:02:45.840> I<00:02:45.990> have<00:02:46.170> all

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
for drag racing so right now I have all

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.200 
for drag racing so right now I have all
the<00:02:46.530> weight<00:02:46.740> of<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.160> batteries<00:02:47.550> over<00:02:48.120> the

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
the weight of the batteries over the

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.450 
the weight of the batteries over the
rear<00:02:48.420> wheels<00:02:48.630> and<00:02:48.990> I<00:02:49.020> have<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.380> motor<00:02:49.590> almost

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
rear wheels and I have the motor almost

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.880 
rear wheels and I have the motor almost
dead<00:02:50.730> center<00:02:51.060> of<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.210> car<00:02:51.300> so<00:02:51.960> if<00:02:52.500> i<00:02:52.590> move<00:02:52.740> the

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
dead center of the car so if i move the

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.290 
dead center of the car so if i move the
batteries<00:02:53.220> to<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.430> front<00:02:53.730> i'm<00:02:53.850> set<00:02:54.060> up<00:02:54.150> for

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
batteries to the front i'm set up for

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.950 
batteries to the front i'm set up for
autocross<00:02:55.070> it's<00:02:56.070> beautiful<00:02:56.760> great<00:02:57.420> I<00:02:57.660> mean

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
autocross it's beautiful great I mean

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.900 
autocross it's beautiful great I mean
the<00:02:58.050> acceleration<00:02:58.650> is<00:02:58.680> incredible<00:02:59.280> fifty

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
the acceleration is incredible fifty

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.120 
the acceleration is incredible fifty
percent<00:03:00.210> it'll<00:03:00.870> lift<00:03:01.080> both<00:03:01.320> of<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.680> tires<00:03:01.890> off

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
percent it'll lift both of the tires off

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.730 
percent it'll lift both of the tires off
it<00:03:03.000> pops<00:03:03.240> a<00:03:03.360> wheelie<00:03:03.540> okay<00:03:04.230> that's<00:03:04.440> how<00:03:04.530> fast

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
it pops a wheelie okay that's how fast

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.650 
it pops a wheelie okay that's how fast
it<00:03:04.920> is<00:03:05.100> and<00:03:05.640> you<00:03:05.730> have<00:03:05.820> a<00:03:05.880> lot<00:03:05.940> of<00:03:06.150> try<00:03:06.390> space

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
it is and you have a lot of try space

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:07.820 
it is and you have a lot of try space
because<00:03:06.930> there's<00:03:07.080> no<00:03:07.200> engine<00:03:07.560> it's<00:03:07.710> just

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
because there's no engine it's just

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.670 
because there's no engine it's just
motors<00:03:08.250> right<00:03:08.670> exactly<00:03:09.030> and<00:03:09.900> you<00:03:10.050> know<00:03:10.650> I

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
motors right exactly and you know I

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.470 
motors right exactly and you know I
built<00:03:11.040> it<00:03:11.220> because<00:03:11.880> i<00:03:12.000> only<00:03:12.120> had<00:03:12.270> enough<00:03:12.360> money

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
built it because i only had enough money

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.990 
built it because i only had enough money
to<00:03:12.780> do<00:03:12.870> it<00:03:12.990> once<00:03:13.230> i<00:03:13.590> need<00:03:14.100> to<00:03:14.340> build<00:03:14.550> it<00:03:14.730> to<00:03:14.760> do

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
to do it once i need to build it to do

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.050 
to do it once i need to build it to do
all<00:03:15.390> kinds<00:03:16.230> of<00:03:16.260> experimentations<00:03:17.130> so<00:03:17.910> it's

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
all kinds of experimentations so it's

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.449 
all kinds of experimentations so it's
like<00:03:18.150> I<00:03:18.270> keep<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:18.660> motor<00:03:18.840> compartment<00:03:19.459> open

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
like I keep the motor compartment open

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.130 
like I keep the motor compartment open
so<00:03:20.700> that<00:03:20.730> if<00:03:20.970> someone<00:03:21.240> gives<00:03:21.510> me<00:03:21.660> a<00:03:21.780> battery

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
so that if someone gives me a battery

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.170 
so that if someone gives me a battery
pack<00:03:22.350> to<00:03:22.380> test<00:03:22.800> out<00:03:23.040> and<00:03:23.370> can<00:03:23.490> just<00:03:23.610> bolt<00:03:23.880> it<00:03:24.030> in

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
pack to test out and can just bolt it in

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.199 
pack to test out and can just bolt it in
an<00:03:24.420> hour<00:03:25.050> or<00:03:25.430> very<00:03:26.430> kuna<00:03:26.760> how<00:03:26.880> much<00:03:27.030> did<00:03:27.180> it

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
an hour or very kuna how much did it

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.360 
an hour or very kuna how much did it
cost<00:03:27.330> for<00:03:27.630> you<00:03:27.750> to<00:03:27.810> do<00:03:27.990> this<00:03:28.170> sixty<00:03:29.160> five

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
cost for you to do this sixty five

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.610 
cost for you to do this sixty five
thousand<00:03:29.790> dollars<00:03:30.030> that's<00:03:30.480> it<00:03:30.840> sixty-five

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
thousand dollars that's it sixty-five

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.860 
thousand dollars that's it sixty-five
thousand<00:03:32.010> so<00:03:32.220> we<00:03:32.340> can<00:03:32.490> have<00:03:32.610> their<00:03:32.760> own<00:03:32.870> Shelby
