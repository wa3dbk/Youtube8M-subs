00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:08.430
 and good as I told several of 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:11.940
 you or in some videos I wanted to do 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.530
 in healthy recipes because all good 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.540
 we have to learn to eat a little 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.700
 healthier and good this time 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.119
 let's make a paste 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.199
 with a tremendous basil cheese 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:25.350
 spinach that you know is very 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.990
 healthy and oil salt and pepper is 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.630
 all it takes is super easy and you 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.300
 I put the basil I put a little sprig already 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.790
 washed well is more or less like that here in the 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.730
 americans call me baseball 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:44.200
 We are going to put more or less I already 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:47.150
 wash your hands we're going to put the cheese 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:51.550
 I think more or less this amount 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.550
 and we are going to put oil 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.280
 salt and pepper 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.379
 That's all forgiveness and spinach him 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.559
 we have to put some of that attempts and 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:07.659
 if you are going to make this recipe please 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.659
 use the seed oil 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.950
 then healthier this recipe does not 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.080
 it can be because it's going to have the 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.560
 cereals that is the pasta 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.940
 of dairy products that I know are the 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.120
 spinach 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:31.330
 and the ones between the end of the year here better 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.660
 this is not going to hurt them much 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.660
 less 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.950
 all this will be to taste 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.619
 and pepper 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.860
 I'll go back now and I'll return 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.680
 I say if he needed more oil because 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.420
 actually has very little and that's going to 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.950
 be all filling up they are going to put their 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.930
 pasta cooked and nothing nothing else this is 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.670
 very healthy for children who do not 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.250
 like to eat vegetables that have joy 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.830
 you know that the people who 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.250
 they also need iron that is what 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.380
 they have spinach then nothing 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.860
 more we return it in this return and they 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.860
 I say like 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.140
 they're going to throw the spaghetti or the kind of 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.810
 sopor that you want then the 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.090
 bow tie of the sticks yo 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.890
 serious in spaghetti and it stays that way 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.870
 when it warms it it will soften a 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.580
 little because the cheese comes and comes 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.470
 the oil and that's going to be a little bit 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.460
 smoother then 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:51.030
 so bring the spaghetti 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:54.170
 as you see it looks good well rich remember 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.630
 basil spinach here they call it baseball 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.790
 cheese a little bit of salt because I already had 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.180
 the cheese comes out the cheese that you 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.180
 want 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.739
 and the oil and that's it and anamÃ¡ I'm going 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.670
 to accompany with a very small and 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.590
 Now I'm going to make a salad but 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.150
 in another video and well I hope you 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.370
 like not to be afraid of pasta 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.140
 because our body also needs 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.989
 be 'the is in fact children need 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.790
 enough of enrique best to wear 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.890
 spinach so we can put them there 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.690
 nutrients and my child can eat it 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.920
 they love this soup and I hope that if 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.920
 they have children you also
