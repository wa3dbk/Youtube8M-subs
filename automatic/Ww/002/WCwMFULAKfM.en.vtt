seven chord which is an odd ball one if
you're<00:00:42.690> doing<00:00:43.019> just<00:00:43.290> trigger<00:00:43.680> triads

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:53.410 

just<00:00:47.300> F<00:00:47.450> sharp<00:00:47.660> minor<00:00:47.930> flat<00:00:48.470> fire<00:00:51.670> so<00:00:52.670> this<00:00:53.390> is

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
just F sharp minor flat fire so this is

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.290 
just F sharp minor flat fire so this is
a<00:00:53.570> one<00:00:53.900> because<00:00:54.650> I<00:00:54.800> got<00:00:54.980> gold<00:00:57.910> don't<00:00:58.910> think

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
that also so I'm going to key a G so if

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.340 
that also so I'm going to key a G so if
I<00:01:06.380> go<00:01:06.410> 1<00:01:07.010> 2<00:01:07.310> 3<00:01:07.990> 4<00:01:08.990> 5<00:01:09.650> 6<00:01:10.310> i'm<00:01:10.670> going<00:01:11.300> to<00:01:11.390> a<00:01:11.420> 625

give us up to five four three section of
a<00:02:23.420> 4.34<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.870> fire<00:02:27.680> it's<00:02:28.680> pretty<00:02:29.130> simple<00:02:29.460> I

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
a 4.34 the fire it's pretty simple I

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.000 
a 4.34 the fire it's pretty simple I
don't<00:02:30.120> you<00:02:30.180> start<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:30.750> could<00:02:31.230> get<00:02:31.410> confused<00:02:31.890> a

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
don't you start you could get confused a

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.590 
don't you start you could get confused a
little<00:02:32.130> bit<00:02:32.340> about<00:02:32.550> it<00:02:32.760> it<00:02:33.060> takes<00:02:33.300> a<00:02:33.480> while

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
little bit about it it takes a while

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.250 
little bit about it it takes a while
just<00:02:33.810> like<00:02:34.170> basic<00:02:34.650> basic<00:02:35.220> theory<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:36.960> apply

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
just like basic basic theory and apply

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.790 
just like basic basic theory and apply
it<00:02:37.290> in<00:02:37.500> on<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.740> guitar<00:02:39.440> this<00:02:40.440> works<00:02:40.710> pretty

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
it in on the guitar this works pretty

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.440 
it in on the guitar this works pretty
good<00:02:40.980> because<00:02:41.250> it<00:02:41.460> really<00:02:41.610> breaks<00:02:41.850> it<00:02:42.090> off<00:02:42.240> and

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
good because it really breaks it off and

00:02:42.450 --> 00:03:07.690 
good because it really breaks it off and
stick<00:02:42.630> them

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.960 

that's<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:08.790> neat<00:03:08.940> little<00:03:09.090> tool<00:03:10.040> is<00:03:11.040> usually<00:03:11.520> the

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
that's a neat little tool is usually the

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.490 
that's a neat little tool is usually the
three<00:03:12.180> works<00:03:12.420> for<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:14.300> 5d<00:03:15.300> and<00:03:15.330> a<00:03:15.510> b-<00:03:16.080> sound

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
three works for the 5d and a b- sound

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.880 
three works for the 5d and a b- sound
really<00:03:16.800> holes<00:03:17.930> and<00:03:20.780> the<00:03:21.780> c<00:03:22.020> major<00:03:22.140> seven<00:03:22.470> for

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
really holes and the c major seven for

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.920 
really holes and the c major seven for
the<00:03:22.920> E<00:03:23.040> minor<00:03:23.960> giving<00:03:24.960> your<00:03:25.080> 7<00:03:25.910> reminder

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.929 

we're<00:03:29.560> pretty<00:03:29.829> close<00:03:30.099> for<00:03:30.430> that<00:03:30.549> one<00:03:30.700> not

00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:30.939 
we're pretty close for that one not

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:42.370 
we're pretty close for that one not
really

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:48.390 

Oh
