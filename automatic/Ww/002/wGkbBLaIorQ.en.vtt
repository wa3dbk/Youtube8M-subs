00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.760
 Flageolet is a gentle crystal sound 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.400
 which are extracted by the shield of the right hand 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:16.450
 at the same time touching someone from 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:19.560
 the fingers of the left hand are very delicate 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.560
 light touch 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.070
 but not all conclusions but only 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.650
 certain namely on the twelfth on 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.430
 seventh 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.800
 and on the fifth bass strings more 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.250
 susceptible to flageolet am on them 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:44.060
 extract and some others and so 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:54.110
 open string 11 from 7 to 5 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:54.580
 4 3 each and there are already intermediate ones 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.790
 fruit 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.660
 the essence of flageoil is that 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.570
 oscillating string 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.740
 besides its main sound publishes more 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.660
 overtones i.e. sounds higher 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.610
 which are absorbed by the main sound 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:15.640
 here we only hear low bass 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:18.350
 sounds and words does not catch 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.940
 contained inside this sound here these 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.990
 here are our at sound 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.650
 by touch country in certain 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.660
 places we put out the main sound and 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.300
 release that overtone which 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:36.800
 is in this place if by country 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:39.130
 touch exactly on her middle and this 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.440
 there will be 12 watts that is the place where 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.060
 body ends 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.650
 that 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.530
 will extract an octave regret he will 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.860
 sound an octave higher than open 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.860
 string 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:58.290
 accordingly, if this distance 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:01.620
 divide again in half it will be 5 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:05.300
 watt and here we will have again 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.300
 octave from what was here 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:12.340
 if this distance is divided in half 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.340
 again these will be an octave higher 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.480
 let be 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:27.000
 if we divide the string into 3 equal 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:30.390
 pieces and touch the points 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.330
 separation then we get a sound that will 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:39.600
 a fifth through an octave above the main 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:45.770
 tones and this will be from the seventh fret and fret 19 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.770
 here are two identical sounds 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:53.330
 the sound is such a quint loft grass 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.140
 also maybe you vest on the ninth year 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.710
 it sounds exactly the same only on the vest 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.400
 the fourth 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:07.330
 namely the big third in two octaves 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.330
 here is the main tone 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:13.450
 it will be something different as dividing the string 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:17.230
 on five equal parts of natural points 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:21.790
 division will be 4 namely on the fourth 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:25.209
 fret on the ninth on the sixteenth and somewhere 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.719
 right here at the edge of the outlet fla flame vests 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:31.920
 whole fragments of some are played without 

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:31.920
 for example the preludes of villalobos and 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.810
 whole chords are used here worse than years
