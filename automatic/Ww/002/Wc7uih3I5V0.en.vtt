00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
easy way to practice and we're actually

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.400 
easy way to practice and we're actually
going<00:00:07.620> to<00:00:07.680> practice<00:00:08.130> on<00:00:08.280> a<00:00:08.309> grapefruit<00:00:09.410> you

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
going to practice on a grapefruit you

going to practice on a grapefruit you
notice<00:00:10.679> I'm<00:00:10.800> wearing<00:00:10.950> rubber<00:00:11.280> gloves<00:00:11.370> here

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910

notice I'm wearing rubber gloves here
always<00:00:12.540> work<00:00:12.750> with<00:00:12.929> your<00:00:12.990> machine<00:00:13.860> whether

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
always work with your machine whether

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.799 
always work with your machine whether
your<00:00:14.340> practice<00:00:14.759> or<00:00:14.880> not<00:00:15.120> use<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.630> rubber

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
your practice or not use the rubber

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.170 
your practice or not use the rubber
gloves<00:00:16.170> because<00:00:16.590> it's<00:00:17.190> hard<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.699> get<00:00:17.850> used<00:00:18.000> to

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
gloves because it's hard to get used to

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.929 
gloves because it's hard to get used to
handle<00:00:18.600> on<00:00:18.660> everything<00:00:19.140> with<00:00:19.609> rubber<00:00:20.609> gloves

on<00:00:21.119> if<00:00:21.390> you<00:00:21.630> do<00:00:21.750> it<00:00:21.869> without<00:00:21.960> them<00:00:22.439> just<00:00:22.650> for

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
on if you do it without them just for

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.529 
on if you do it without them just for
your<00:00:23.039> practicing<00:00:23.699> when<00:00:23.850> you<00:00:23.939> really<00:00:24.210> start<00:00:24.510> to

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
your practicing when you really start to

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.480 
your practicing when you really start to
tattoo<00:00:25.019> you're<00:00:25.560> gonna<00:00:25.680> put<00:00:25.890> these<00:00:26.010> gloves<00:00:26.250> on

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
tattoo you're gonna put these gloves on

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.529 
tattoo you're gonna put these gloves on
and<00:00:26.550> everything<00:00:27.090> is<00:00:27.150> going<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.359> feel

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
and everything is going to feel

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.330 
and everything is going to feel
different<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.140> so<00:00:28.349> get<00:00:28.830> used<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.250> working

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
different to you so get used to working

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.099 
different to you so get used to working
all<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.000> time<00:00:30.060> with<00:00:30.390> rubber<00:00:30.599> gloves<00:00:30.900> you

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
all the time with rubber gloves you

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.810 
all the time with rubber gloves you
always<00:00:31.500> have<00:00:31.679> on<00:00:31.830> mine<00:00:32.009> I'm<00:00:32.489> going<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.669> show

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
always have on mine I'm going to show

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.880 
always have on mine I'm going to show
you<00:00:32.880> again<00:00:33.690> how<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:33.930> set<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.320> Machine<00:00:34.620> up<00:00:34.649> I'm

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
you again how to set the Machine up I'm

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.030 
you again how to set the Machine up I'm
gonna<00:00:35.040> set<00:00:35.760> this<00:00:35.910> up<00:00:36.120> with<00:00:36.469> an<00:00:37.469> outlining

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
gonna set this up with an outlining

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:51.560 
gonna set this up with an outlining
needle<00:00:49.640> what<00:00:50.640> I'm<00:00:50.730> going<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:50.879> use<00:00:50.940> on<00:00:51.239> this<00:00:51.390> for

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
needle what I'm going to use on this for

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.779 
needle what I'm going to use on this for
the<00:00:51.629> practice<00:00:52.140> this<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.530> number<00:00:52.949> 5<00:00:53.309> that

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
the practice this is a number 5 that

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.209 
the practice this is a number 5 that
means<00:00:53.820> there's<00:00:54.239> 5<00:00:54.570> needles<00:00:55.050> in<00:00:55.199> here<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:56.100> are

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
means there's 5 needles in here that are

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.799 
means there's 5 needles in here that are
pushed<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.640> round<00:00:56.969> point<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.629> it's<00:00:57.719> an

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
pushed to a round point and it's an

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.569 
pushed to a round point and it's an
outliner<00:00:58.260> it's<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.890> little<00:00:59.100> different<00:00:59.460> than

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
outliner it's a little different than

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.250 
outliner it's a little different than
the<00:00:59.670> shader<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.090> told<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.539> before<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.989> shader

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
the shader I told you before the shader

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.110 
the shader I told you before the shader
isn't<00:01:01.559> more<00:01:01.710> like<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.890> brush<00:01:02.280> type

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
isn't more like a brush type

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.870 
isn't more like a brush type
configuration<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.769> needle<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.220> we're

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
configuration and the needle so we're

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.820 
configuration and the needle so we're
going<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.060> set<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.420> one<00:01:06.630> up<00:01:06.689> in<00:01:06.960> here<00:01:07.020> which

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
going to set this one up in here which

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.160 
going to set this one up in here which
one<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.159> do<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.460> take<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.210> needle<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.869> see<00:01:10.049> how

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
one to do is take the needle you see how

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.260 
one to do is take the needle you see how
the<00:01:10.229> hoop<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:10.710> on<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.979> bar<00:01:11.189> there's<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.060> little

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
the hoop is on the bar there's a little

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.630 
the hoop is on the bar there's a little
break<00:01:12.479> in<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.750> hoop<00:01:12.930> here<00:01:13.229> if<00:01:13.590> it's<00:01:14.070> coiled

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
break in the hoop here if it's coiled

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.399 
break in the hoop here if it's coiled
that<00:01:14.909> way<00:01:15.150> what<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.780> want<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:15.990> do<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.170> set<00:01:16.380> that

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
that way what you want to do is set that

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.870 
that way what you want to do is set that
into<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.830> Machine<00:01:17.159> go<00:01:17.280> through<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.610> bottom

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
into the Machine go through the bottom

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.700 
into the Machine go through the bottom
of<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.030> Machine<00:01:18.330> set<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.320> up<00:01:19.409> there's<00:01:19.619> a

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
of the Machine set it up there's a

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.679 
of the Machine set it up there's a
little<00:01:19.950> rubber<00:01:20.100> grommet<00:01:20.759> on<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.360> end<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.630> that

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
little rubber grommet on the end of that

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.450 
little rubber grommet on the end of that
armature<00:01:22.259> bar<00:01:22.470> you're<00:01:22.799> going<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:22.979> push<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
armature bar you're going to push the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.420 
armature bar you're going to push the
needle<00:01:23.610> bar<00:01:23.970> over<00:01:24.450> that<00:01:24.600> grommet<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:26.130> it's<00:01:26.310> on

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
needle bar over that grommet so it's on

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.969 
needle bar over that grommet so it's on
there<00:01:26.580> good<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:26.790> tight<00:01:27.020> ok<00:01:28.020> if<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:28.829> have<00:01:28.920> a

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
there good and tight ok if you have a

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.620 
there good and tight ok if you have a
problem<00:01:29.340> getting<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.700> onto<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.180> grommet

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
problem getting this onto the grommet

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.850 
problem getting this onto the grommet
I'll<00:01:30.810> show<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.079> another<00:01:31.200> way<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.500> can<00:01:31.710> do<00:01:31.829> it

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
I'll show you another way you can do it

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.530 
I'll show you another way you can do it
first<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.369> can<00:01:32.490> take<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.790> grommet<00:01:33.180> right<00:01:33.360> off

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
first you can take the grommet right off

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.210 
first you can take the grommet right off
the<00:01:33.720> end<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:34.020> there<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.740> can<00:01:34.860> see<00:01:35.009> there's<00:01:35.159> a

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
the end of there you can see there's a

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.310 
the end of there you can see there's a
little<00:01:35.430> steel<00:01:35.729> pole<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.990> can<00:01:37.140> actually

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
little steel pole you can actually

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.789 
little steel pole you can actually
insert<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.250> grommet<00:01:38.670> into<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.119> needle<00:01:39.540> bar

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
insert the grommet into the needle bar

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.080 
insert the grommet into the needle bar
sometimes<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.070> easier<00:01:41.460> because<00:01:41.759> they're

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
sometimes this is easier because they're

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.010 
sometimes this is easier because they're
hard<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.360> get<00:01:42.509> on<00:01:42.630> when<00:01:42.780> they're<00:01:42.869> on<00:01:42.960> the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
hard to get on when they're on the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.810 
hard to get on when they're on the
machine<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.950> then<00:01:44.130> just<00:01:44.310> run<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.670> other

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
machine and then just run it the other

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.249 
machine and then just run it the other
way<00:01:44.970> through<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.299> Machine<00:01:45.570> just<00:01:45.780> pull<00:01:46.140> it

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
way through the Machine just pull it

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.260 
way through the Machine just pull it
through<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.799> then<00:01:47.520> just<00:01:47.820> stick<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.119> whole

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
through and then just stick the whole

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.700 
through and then just stick the whole
thing<00:01:48.299> right<00:01:48.659> on<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.930> end<00:01:49.079> of<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.290> armature

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
thing right on the end of the armature

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.389 
thing right on the end of the armature
bar<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:50.520> always<00:01:50.939> remember<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:52.310> when<00:01:53.310> you

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
bar you always remember that when you

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.889 
bar you always remember that when you
put<00:01:53.579> this<00:01:53.700> needle<00:01:54.030> on<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.509> loop<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.869> going

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
put this needle on the loop is going

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.959 
put this needle on the loop is going
that<00:01:55.290> way<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:55.860> that's<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.369> way<00:01:56.490> your<00:01:56.670> needle

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
that way so that's the way your needle

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.910 
that way so that's the way your needle
is<00:01:57.090> set<00:01:57.329> you'll<00:01:57.899> see<00:01:58.079> how<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.320> needle<00:01:58.710> is

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
is set you'll see how the needle is

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.520 
is set you'll see how the needle is
soldered<00:01:59.369> onto<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.850> bar<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.869> needles<00:02:01.229> got<00:02:01.409> to

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
soldered onto the bar the needles got to

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.350 
soldered onto the bar the needles got to
be<00:02:01.619> on<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.890> bottom<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.790> bar<00:02:02.939> should<00:02:03.119> be<00:02:03.180> on

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
be on the bottom of the bar should be on

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.999 
be on the bottom of the bar should be on
top<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.810> needle<00:02:03.960> solder<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.649> bottom

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
top of the needle solder to the bottom

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.060 
top of the needle solder to the bottom
now<00:02:05.790> your<00:02:05.969> needles<00:02:06.270> in<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.479> machine

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
now your needles in the machine

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.830 
now your needles in the machine
you<00:02:07.460> loosen<00:02:07.880> up<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.149> Chuck<00:02:08.390> a<00:02:08.420> little<00:02:08.630> bit

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
you loosen up the Chuck a little bit

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.600 
you loosen up the Chuck a little bit
that's<00:02:09.020> going<00:02:09.200> to<00:02:09.259> hold<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.590> tube<00:02:09.830> we're

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
that's going to hold the tube we're

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.930 
that's going to hold the tube we're
going<00:02:10.729> to<00:02:10.789> get<00:02:10.880> it<00:02:10.970> to<00:02:11.150> volunteer<00:02:12.790> I'm<00:02:13.790> gonna

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
going to get it to volunteer I'm gonna

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.010 
going to get it to volunteer I'm gonna
give<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.210> two<00:02:14.330> of<00:02:14.450> you<00:02:14.510> here<00:02:14.570> with<00:02:14.780> a<00:02:14.810> bigger

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
give the two of you here with a bigger

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.320 
give the two of you here with a bigger
grip<00:02:15.380> on<00:02:15.590> it<00:02:15.800> just<00:02:16.340> because<00:02:16.760> it's<00:02:16.940> easier<00:02:17.209> to

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
grip on it just because it's easier to

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.170 
grip on it just because it's easier to
look<00:02:17.480> at<00:02:17.800> slide<00:02:18.800> that<00:02:19.040> up<00:02:19.280> inside<00:02:19.820> of<00:02:19.850> there

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
look at slide that up inside of there

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.030 
look at slide that up inside of there
and<00:02:20.360> then<00:02:21.230> you're<00:02:21.380> kind<00:02:21.500> of<00:02:21.620> basically

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
and then you're kind of basically

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.560 
and then you're kind of basically
threading<00:02:22.550> the<00:02:22.610> needle<00:02:22.640> through<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.180> little

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
threading the needle through the little

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.230 
threading the needle through the little
end<00:02:23.810> of<00:02:23.959> the<00:02:24.080> the<00:02:25.070> tube<00:02:25.310> there<00:02:25.580> that's<00:02:26.000> all<00:02:26.120> you

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
end of the the tube there that's all you

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.300 
end of the the tube there that's all you
want<00:02:26.390> to<00:02:26.480> do<00:02:26.570> is<00:02:26.720> get<00:02:26.870> it<00:02:26.990> so<00:02:27.140> falls<00:02:28.040> right

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
want to do is get it so falls right

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.730 
want to do is get it so falls right
inside<00:02:28.670> that<00:02:28.970> and<00:02:29.630> be<00:02:29.870> careful<00:02:30.320> with<00:02:30.440> this<00:02:30.560> too

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
inside that and be careful with this too

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.380 
inside that and be careful with this too
you<00:02:30.860> don't<00:02:30.920> want<00:02:31.100> to<00:02:31.160> bend<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.430> needle<00:02:31.730> when

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
you don't want to bend the needle when

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.270 
you don't want to bend the needle when
you're<00:02:32.510> doing<00:02:32.780> it<00:02:32.900> so<00:02:32.930> go<00:02:33.200> real<00:02:33.500> slow<00:02:33.770> and<00:02:34.070> then

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
you're doing it so go real slow and then

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.420 
you're doing it so go real slow and then
just<00:02:35.060> draw<00:02:35.300> that<00:02:35.480> up<00:02:35.720> and<00:02:36.260> tighten<00:02:37.250> this<00:02:37.370> down

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
just draw that up and tighten this down

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.710 
just draw that up and tighten this down
I'm<00:02:37.850> going<00:02:37.970> to<00:02:38.030> show<00:02:38.150> you<00:02:38.180> the<00:02:38.360> end<00:02:38.480> of<00:02:38.630> this

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
I'm going to show you the end of this

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.860 
I'm going to show you the end of this

tube so you know how far enough when
we're<00:02:41.870> going<00:02:41.959> to<00:02:42.020> tighten<00:02:42.230> this<00:02:42.470> Chuck<00:02:42.800> up

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
we're going to tighten this Chuck up

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.560 
we're going to tighten this Chuck up
here<00:02:43.190> so<00:02:43.370> that<00:02:43.550> the<00:02:43.730> tube<00:02:43.940> doesn't<00:02:44.180> slide

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
here so that the tube doesn't slide

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.560 
here so that the tube doesn't slide
around<00:02:45.430> now<00:02:46.430> you'll<00:02:46.640> be<00:02:46.670> able<00:02:46.880> to<00:02:47.090> see<00:02:47.300> the

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
of the tube it's about that maybe the

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.660 
of the tube it's about that maybe the
thickness<00:03:03.110> of<00:03:03.230> a<00:03:03.350> couple<00:03:03.739> sheets<00:03:04.010> of<00:03:04.160> papers
