00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 Hello, Sir, Modest Tastes from the kitchen 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.920
 In this section, we will share the description of "Tomato Sauce" 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.640
 But if you want to have a look at the necessary materials before 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.720
 half a pound of chicken 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.720
 3-4 pieces of tomato 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.040
 1 tbsp butter 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.600
 1 teaspoon of salt 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.880
 and 1 teaspoon of black pepper 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.480
 we know the necessary ingredients for roasting tomato 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.600
 In the meantime we have washed our stonework, now we will begin our chopping process 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.920
 cut into several pieces 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.960
 stony 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.240
 but very tasty 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.960
 you will already notice 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.680
 let's go by the fire to roast now 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.640
 we leave the butter in the pan 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.480
 after waiting for a little melting 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.720
 we'll roast at least 15 minutes 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.480
 we also chop our tomatoes in the meantime 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.680
 We have 4 tomatoes 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.040
 our tomatoes are a bit small 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.480
 if there is a bigger one, 2 will be sufficient 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.320
 peel 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.880
 we cut our tomato 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.200
 will add to the roasting stone 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.920
 stony 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.080
 it took about 15 minutes, it was 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.800
 now we add the tomatoes we cut 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.000
 salt on ... 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.160
 and after adding black pepper ... 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.360
 tomato 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.840
 as you can see tomatoes also completely lost shape 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.880
 we can take fire now 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.440
 time 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.000
 Let's serve immediately 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 let's shuffle before 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.640
 there is no more work left 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.080
 the tomato's juice is completely melted, it's over 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.240
 Modest Flavors in this part of the kitchen ... 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.240
 we shared a different and delicious recipe 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.240
 We learned about the construction of "Roasting Tomato Sauce" 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.920
 I would like you to try and remember us as soon as possible 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.680
 goodbye...
