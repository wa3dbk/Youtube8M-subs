00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.410
 Hi, guys, I'm the league from here. 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.059
 child nutritionist at the 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.340
 doctor william aliotti her many 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.740
 people say it's expensive to diet 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.640
 but today we will learn to do the 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.039
 Just one homemade game of death 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.580
 goes beyond 10 of utis 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:28.410
 how are we going to use two liters of 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:31.610
 clear skimmed milk and only one 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.450
 whole or skimmed yogurt pot 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.540
 tasteless 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.510
 the skim will basically stick with 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.190
 a slightly less dense and 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.750
 or integral will have a 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.969
 denser consistency 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.520
 What I chose to do today is kogut. 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.039
 skimmed we 'll put two liters 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.579
 of milk a milkmaid and we'll take 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.579
 to fire 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.039
 as boiling milk it can 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.449
 to report some popular films 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.579
 called cream 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:09.360
 then you can get a spoon that 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:12.780
 removing these films, turn off the 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.659
 fire and wait a few minutes can be in 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.070
 about 15 to 20 minutes until the milk 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.860
 start to govern 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.700
 you can touch your little finger 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.799
 obviously and put up with a little bit if 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.780
 you can because you're already at the point 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.869
 if it's too hot you have to 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.740
 wait it gets warm but not cold 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:37.729
 The next step is you pick up on 70 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:42.350
 grams basically a pot of yogurt 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:46.070
 same ready-to-market skimmed 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:50.040
 putting in that milk that is already lukewarm 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:52.229
 very well you can use a spoon 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.350
 or that equipment is what he calls went 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.409
 which is basically to give a mixed 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.659
 and become more homogeneous at first he 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.730
 It will be fine liquid and how folks 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:10.480
 to make it all from here 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:12.100
 in utis you will use a lid and 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:17.320
 some plans 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:19.150
 You put here covers it well. 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.090
 closed 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.190
 you can use up to two to three cloths 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.660
 and after allowing himself to rest around 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.450
 eight o'clock 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.910
 If you have a very hot day, you can 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.310
 leave for about six hours and already 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.370
 and checking for the ones who like my last 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.080
 more every two hours or more. 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.810
 the less you use a shell to 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.650
 taking the serum that was forming this 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.930
 liquid 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.360
 By the end of these eight hours, you're going 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.030
 have a game with a good consistency and 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.640
 finished at 8 o'clock already puts 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.450
 and is consuming along the 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.670
 week 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.290
 This was my tip today. 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.290
 You liked it and until the next
