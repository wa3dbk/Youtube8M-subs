00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
so let me go into browser and you can

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.920 
so let me go into browser and you can
actually<00:01:47.369> change<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.850> size<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.630> layout

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
actually change the size of the layout

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.200 
actually change the size of the layout
so<00:01:49.500> as<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.710> can<00:01:49.829> see<00:01:50.040> there<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.250> an<00:01:50.460> example<00:01:50.850> of

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
so as you can see there is an example of

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.840 
so as you can see there is an example of
what<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:51.840> will<00:01:51.960> look<00:01:52.020> like<00:01:52.250> so<00:01:53.250> let<00:01:53.460> me<00:01:53.490> slide

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
what it will look like so let me slide

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.780 
what it will look like so let me slide
the<00:01:54.119> right<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.750> then<00:01:55.560> actually<00:01:56.100> apply<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.490> and

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
the right and then actually apply it and

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.670 
the right and then actually apply it and
let's<00:01:57.000> see<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.509> difference<00:01:57.899> from<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.079> regular

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
let's see the difference from a regular

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.490 
let's see the difference from a regular
browser

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.630 

just<00:02:04.500> try<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:04.950> one<00:02:05.159> more<00:02:05.189> time<00:02:05.570> apply<00:02:06.710> okay<00:02:07.710> so

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
just try it one more time apply okay so

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.699 
just try it one more time apply okay so
in<00:02:08.910> my<00:02:09.030> four<00:02:09.300> might<00:02:09.569> force<00:02:09.929> close<00:02:10.259> let's<00:02:10.530> see

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
in my four might force close let's see

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.100 
in my four might force close let's see
if<00:02:10.770> you<00:02:10.950> see<00:02:11.130> if<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.370> works<00:02:12.239> turn<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.900> browser

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
if you see if it works turn the browser

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.160 
if you see if it works turn the browser
let's<00:02:14.069> see<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.220> difference<00:02:14.630> so<00:02:15.630> as<00:02:15.690> you<00:02:15.810> can<00:02:15.930> see

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
maybe a 10 inch tablet this is a great

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.259 
maybe a 10 inch tablet this is a great
way<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.620> make<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.489> buttons<00:02:35.760> bigger<00:02:35.970> so<00:02:36.180> they

way to make the buttons bigger so they

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.390 
way to make the buttons bigger so they
can<00:02:36.420> read<00:02:36.600> everything<00:02:37.019> easier<00:02:37.400> especially

can read everything easier especially

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.009 
can read everything easier especially
the<00:02:38.700> web<00:02:38.819> pages<00:02:39.000> you<00:02:39.360> can<00:02:39.390> see<00:02:39.630> all<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.780> words

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
the web pages you can see all the words

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.990 
the web pages you can see all the words
are<00:02:40.260> much<00:02:40.500> bigger<00:02:40.709> and<00:02:40.860> much<00:02:41.340> easier<00:02:41.430> if<00:02:41.850> they

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
are much bigger and much easier if they

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.170 
are much bigger and much easier if they
are<00:02:42.150> farsighted<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.959> that<00:02:43.080> nearsighted<00:02:44.180> so

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
are farsighted and that nearsighted so

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.400 
are farsighted and that nearsighted so
there's<00:02:45.330> another<00:02:45.540> great<00:02:45.810> feature<00:02:45.989> and<00:02:46.319> you

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
let's do calculator let's change it to a

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.970 
let's do calculator let's change it to a
little<00:02:58.560> bit<00:02:58.650> bigger<00:02:58.799> apply<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.930> ok<00:03:00.930> it<00:03:01.440> says

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
little bit bigger apply and ok it says

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.430 
little bit bigger apply and ok it says
okay<00:03:02.569> success<00:03:03.569> for<00:03:03.690> you<00:03:03.750> apply<00:03:03.989> that's<00:03:04.260> going

okay success for you apply that's going

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.620 
okay success for you apply that's going
to<00:03:04.530> calculator<00:03:04.980> now<00:03:05.220> as<00:03:05.549> you<00:03:06.269> can<00:03:06.359> see<00:03:06.420> the

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
to calculator now as you can see the

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.599 
to calculator now as you can see the
bigger<00:03:06.870> buttons<00:03:07.170> so<00:03:08.100> you<00:03:08.190> can<00:03:08.310> see<00:03:08.459> now

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:08.609 
bigger buttons so you can see now

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:10.520 
bigger buttons so you can see now
they're<00:03:08.820> a<00:03:08.850> lot<00:03:09.030> bigger<00:03:09.239> I<00:03:09.540> believe<00:03:10.049> I<00:03:10.380> haven't

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
they're a lot bigger I believe I haven't

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.340 
they're a lot bigger I believe I haven't
actually<00:03:11.190> never<00:03:11.489> use<00:03:11.700> kakeland<00:03:11.940> tablet<00:03:12.660> so

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
actually never use kakeland tablet so

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.840 
actually never use kakeland tablet so
they<00:03:13.590> should<00:03:13.859> be<00:03:13.920> a<00:03:13.950> lot<00:03:14.100> bigger<00:03:14.250> yes<00:03:14.579> as<00:03:14.730> you

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
they should be a lot bigger yes as you

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.000 
they should be a lot bigger yes as you
can<00:03:14.970> see<00:03:15.150> it<00:03:15.329> is<00:03:15.480> overly<00:03:16.049> large<00:03:16.200> X<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:16.920> all

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
can see it is overly large X and all

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.130 
can see it is overly large X and all
that<00:03:17.220> so<00:03:18.030> that's<00:03:18.239> another<00:03:18.510> way<00:03:18.780> that<00:03:18.810> you<00:03:18.989> can

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
that so that's another way that you can

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.870 
that so that's another way that you can
make<00:03:19.380> all<00:03:19.590> your<00:03:19.920> parents<00:03:20.370> and<00:03:20.519> maybe<00:03:20.700> your

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
make all your parents and maybe your

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
life's easier if made by making them

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.229 
life's easier if made by making them
everything<00:03:22.980> a<00:03:23.040> lot<00:03:23.160> bigger<00:03:23.400> there's<00:03:24.120> one

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
everything a lot bigger there's one

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.940 
everything a lot bigger there's one
