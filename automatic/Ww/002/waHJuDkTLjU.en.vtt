00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.250
 and the current youtube community I hope 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.420
 that my gamer is going very well 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.770
 explore projects and good this time 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.509
 we are in a new video tutorial and 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.229
 Well, let's see what we finish 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:24.700
 of berg a while ago that would be what it is 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.500
 walk in the water when this really 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.329
 it's very simple do not be buj or something like that 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.649
 but hey, it's really a curiosity 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:32.020
 that I have planned for a video 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:33.069
 tutorial in the future but fine here 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.319
 As you can see he is walking on the 

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:36.640
 water I usually fall I wind and 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:39.159
 the whole thing and I'm walking on the 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.479
 good water like I do not really 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.399
 I'm walking on the water because 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.450
 because as they see and could see in the 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:45.250
 video was a bit sunken but 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.189
 he really did not believe me then that's what 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.659
 achieved because you look down and there's 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:52.450
 nothing ok then well I think that 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.819
 we need we need what would be a 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.200
 Ice cube and good many cudillero 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:58.479
 to do something like what you just 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.770
 do in a bucket of water and well then 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.759
 any material not here as they can 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.649
 see what I'm going to do is a structure 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.569
 a small structure like a well type 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.009
 and what I'm going to do is lower it down 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:08.200
 a few levels to make it look like 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.849
 there's nothing down and that I'm still going to 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.920
 to be able to walk on this and good as 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:14.650
 I'm going to do because the ice here as 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.959
 can but I'm going to place the ice no no 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.950
 you see you do not see in the water this in 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.230
 reality would be 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.209
 Curiously because that is here as 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.709
 can see I put the ice then put 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.420
 water and good it looks like there's no 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.950
 no block and there should be a block 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.930
 you should be able to see the block of ice 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.640
 but you do not see then this is like a 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.989
 type camouflage or something maybe 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.519
 could use to trolling or any 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.319
 thing and good here as you can see the same 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.599
 is with a font type or something like that 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.790
 water and then I can not go because because 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.989
 the ice cube I go out and you can not see I'm going 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.370
 to surround the structure and good as 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.530
 you can appreciate nowhere you see it is 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.750
 as if the ice was invisible this 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.370
 explains the two ways both that the 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.049
 water cover the ice like ice 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.250
 now covers the water ok 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:54.190
 well now let's see what would be 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.360
 I'm going to go fast here and then 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.849
 now let's create what would be a 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.260
 structure but before good here how 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.569
 we can I will start to remove so that 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.760
 see that everything is made of ice 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.560
 that the water is on and below is the 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.329
 block of what would be the ice that 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.099
 I want to start removing it so they can see 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:11.019
 what does it really cost us on the 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.180
 prayer is common is an illusion for is 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.860
 that is called cristian I edition and then 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.810
 it seems I'm walking on the 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.340
 water or good that I do not fall when stepping on the 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.780
 water because good because the cubes are 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.360
 of ice down but how 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.590
 the water is invisible and vice versa 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.209
 then you can not really count 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.190
 then it could be one to troll 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.810
 or things and it's a curious fact 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.130
 but here how can they see or not be what 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.560
 which will be a small structure so that 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.850
 can appreciate that both the ice covers 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.290
 water as water covers the ice 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.060
 because I really would not know how 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.530
 answer this does not work anymore the 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.260
 PC version in this update that 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.670
 is the most recent the 179 kroes but 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.110
 here as you can see in the xbox yet 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.970
 it works this is something that discovering 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.800
 a video of someone for my data 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.060
 curious what I'm going to do later and 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.350
 well I realized that this curiosity 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.360
 it no longer served in pc but if 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.620
 it worked an xbox and then as soon as 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.780
 we did curious to do this tutorial 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.450
 He's like this guy but he's given him no 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.400
 I really know but in the end it is to compose 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.900
 just the ice covers the water completely 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.130
 but still the water is there if I remove 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.600
 the ice is going to start watering 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.069
 everywhere and anyway that's all 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.660
 I hope you liked the video 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.819
 I 'm not going to leave it down here in the 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.519
 description what would be in part 2 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:16.130
 episode 2 of my series that came from 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:17.750
 challenges with my friends and 2nd 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.940
 down in the description so they go 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.370
 the videos and the contents and others 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.690
 I'm also going to leave you a video what 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.010
 it would be of the curiosities so that 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.140
 can learn more things and well 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:30.200
 like by milestones like sign up miyem 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:32.290
 vertex play tv 12 and see you on xbox 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.290
 live 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:43.719
 Hieronymite expects good second attempt 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.129
 I bet if it comes out I really was not 

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:47.100
 something I did to him on purpose but you know 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:49.760
 if it's going 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.760
 and here goes 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:58.680
 and what it does is outside wait do not have 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.680
 cough please I'll make a take
