00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
it just won't work as efficiently so

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.540 
it just won't work as efficiently so
make<00:01:46.679> sure<00:01:46.709> that<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.039> just<00:01:47.220> do<00:01:47.399> them

make sure that you just do them

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.550 
make sure that you just do them
individually<00:01:47.810> and<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.959> can<00:01:49.110> repeat<00:01:49.380> the

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
individually and you can repeat the

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.990 
individually and you can repeat the
exact<00:01:49.830> same<00:01:50.009> steps<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.490> we<00:01:50.580> had<00:01:50.700> done<00:01:50.850> for

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
exact same steps that we had done for

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.090 
exact same steps that we had done for
the<00:01:51.090> silver<00:01:51.360> nail<00:01:51.509> here<00:01:51.929> is<00:01:52.080> an<00:01:52.229> up-close<00:01:52.709> clip

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100

the silver nail here is an up-close clip
of<00:01:53.310> what<00:01:53.550> mine<00:01:54.390> looks<00:01:54.660> like<00:01:54.869> obviously<00:01:55.380> your

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
of what mine looks like obviously your

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.410 
of what mine looks like obviously your
pattern<00:01:55.920> will<00:01:56.099> probably<00:01:56.700> be<00:01:56.910> a<00:01:56.940> little<00:01:57.209> bit

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
pattern will probably be a little bit

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.749 
pattern will probably be a little bit
different<00:01:58.039> so<00:01:59.039> now<00:01:59.160> I'm<00:01:59.310> going<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.550> show<00:01:59.700> you
