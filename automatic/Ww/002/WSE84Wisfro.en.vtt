00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.090
 How about guys this time I come with a 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.970
 very interesting trick that consists of 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.960
 use our copies roll or if 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.960
 we have an illusion 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.800
 oh yes we have the command styles too 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:23.910
 we can use it on roll 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.910
 let's see how to use it 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.289
 first we activate our copies 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.269
 we select the copies 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:40.200
 and press the m key and then in line 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:43.800
 let's see let's see how the 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.460
 the copies are destroyed to attack 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.460
 for us 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.210
 the blanket style or if we have breaks of 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.900
 delusion 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:58.430
 not so that it has not been on a roll 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:01:00.910
 interesting you know every time you 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.910
 disappear 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:09.119
 already know how to press m 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.119
 select copies press m 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.329
 and we're going to see that the copies are 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.329
 destroyed 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:15.329
 follow 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.310
 affected 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.310
 style 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:33.890
 I'm going to add 2 good boys 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.900
 continuing with the tip with reference of 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.750
 stream 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.110
 another another interesting little trick is 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.550
 put 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:50.010
 the forest when we have the setter in 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:52.260
 the 3 we can put an eye on the forest 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.240
 it does not seem we have to connect a tree 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.670
 I recommend bleeckere more or less 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.190
 over here because as you know this 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.780
 protector that as beat encore is the 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.479
 good shielding and if you can get to 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.260
 take out a center they can put in laws of 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.260
 forest over here 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:15.410
 these trees would give us vision of rose 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.410
 very important to me gameplay 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.550
 good I wanted to teach 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.130
 with temperance so 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:35.300
 so you know not all boys of 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:39.510
 today and share 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:42.000
 the page of your total the channel of 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:46.670
 youtube that would be contributing much more 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.670
