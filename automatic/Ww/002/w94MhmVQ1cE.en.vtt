 okay, we still have a good demand can 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.610
 way of putting me back down 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:06.030
 thunder which of these was the number 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:09.030

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.690
 the cue flip fishing 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.690
 flute control or jeddah 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:21.389
 i have no idea really where not the 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.229
 app store and april how do I know what 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:27.300
 it endured in depth in April 2009 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:29.430
 what kind of question would I say 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.740
 the cube 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.470
 but i do n't know so i go 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.729
 ask the public for help 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.010
 the audience you are going to help you but 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:38.790
 help and embarrassed usually have them 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.530
 it worked out well 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.600
 audience so hopefully a bit 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.580
 clear that for example 80% and then 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.070
 20% for the rest then so nice and clear 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.450
 if everywhere there is 25% I remember 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.050
 nothing 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.050
 so come on 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:58.740
 flight control tango and shake 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.530
 never heard what you have to do in it 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.900
 but apparently was number one beautiful 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.030
 one thousand dollars in the package old one thousand 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.020
 even in the package 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.720
 we will be going with that for a moment 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:12.660
 printing above your handlebar is of course 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.950
 just neatly name me via email and 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.060
 you really get the questions a lot 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.729
 more difficult 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:20.220
 first 15 cm rotterdam except that 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:23.760
 last then that was just real 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:27.360
 bit weird ok hood that what is the 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:31.070
 nickname of michael sykes and sas 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.310
 Sergeant in the game Chris Crysis Warhead 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:39.140
 crazy 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:41.789
 number cycle or brand the only one 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:46.169
 nickname that I could here 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:49.139
 and finds fit is mad men 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:51.040
 michael mad men sykes would be the most 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:54.280
 are logical 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:59.530
 if I am wrong and then we will thunder 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:06:03.390
 I have nothing with men at the bottom 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.390
 Must take a bit of a gamble your life 

00:06:07.769 --> 00:06:13.599
 What is it 

00:06:10.209 --> 00:06:15.689
 saiko that is not pain after man 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:15.689
 hey 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.810
 those are not nicknames 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:25.310
 or our son's general physical 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:27.590
 condition a thousand euros a nice one 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.819
 won the cup think or know 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.259
 we can in any case sell for 

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:34.330
 ten dollars have 1000 and 10 euros 

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:34.330
 won but from continuous 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.310
 am now so happy with actually lost on it 

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:41.900
 but obviously dollar often also gamers 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.520
 Well if you're like often 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.990
 you have to do this more often and you have to 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.520
 try to go more often because million 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.050
 have again put a forever moment 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.430
 like on this video 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.539
 this episode is a bit shorter because it 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.189
 just some very stupid mistake 

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:53.960
 actually set something free for me 

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:55.430
 It was only logical if we were higher up 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.020
 ladder come there are these episodes 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.669
 also St longer a curve 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.289
 the cool find like this video then 

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:02.479
 for a moment you help me enormously 

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:03.620
 Do your professional games help them through to me? 

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:05.539
 and maybe we will just soon 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.580
 the million are going to win and then we are going 

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:08.900
 do nice things with bliss I think 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.729
 male looking guys thanks for that 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.319
 especially like it and i'm going to be this guy 

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:13.699
 build because earlier on 

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:16.150
 the question hits 

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:16.150
 lucky
