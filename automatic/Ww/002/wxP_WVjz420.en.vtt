00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.889
 what acting is intelligence 

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:10.090
 that's why the intelligent 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:10.889
 drive ahead and me too 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.750
 support 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.400
 in critical situations when we go to 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.960
 example schiller is 30 on it 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.060
 we already know exactly what else 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.699
 a sign 30 30 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.380
 hello set camera which can be 500 meters 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:26.080
 look far and scans in front of me 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.820
 range from 50 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.740
 right now okay but only indicates the 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.039
 does not drive now 50 or reminds approximately 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.830
 on 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.030
 but then I come this statement 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.309
 I will come back again to 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.989
 Now we have just banned here 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:39.300
 black times if I have a clear one now 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.040
 he warns me so he recognizes tempolimits 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.600
 just prohibitions and their easy 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.640
 prohibition and overtaking prohibition and their 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.570
 repeal 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.370
 gc also has 3d 50 meters far is 3d 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.500
 capable and now not only recognizes 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.090
 signs but also recognizes me 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.089
 standing obstacles ahead driving 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.500
 Obstacles Pedestrian now recognizes 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:01.870
 example also that means if I on the 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.210
 road traffic is bin month merck 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.299
 saw what happened either an accident 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.590
 but the system warns me that is called him 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:10.090
 knows the situation says that 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.040
 Pedestrian or not so I had to 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.140
 gibson was then when I still have 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.270
 Do not react then a case 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.470
 initiate autonomous braking on Switzerland 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.400
 the pedestrian force to day awaits me 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.159
 and does a fully autonomous stunt 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.320
 up to 50 km / h can fully autonomous 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.990
 avoid accident or you do not have 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.060
 braked slowed me down , please 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.950
 If we were on the front sign sign 70 better 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.480
 Look, yes, and he shows me that 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.450
 not why not because it is not 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.330
 Rains twice in front 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.780
 Obstacle expect the same situation 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:47.800
 But before that, he would have to clear the way 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.750
 and the fuel foot on the brake 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.970
 they have now like the sony plus in it 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.450
 or now I have the times in it 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.450
 the distronic plus 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.240
 So he is self-employed again 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.329
 slowed down that works only if 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.710
 no no no there the pedestrians I habs 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:04.159
 but now with s tronic made once 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.299
 without 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.299
 Here we have the rear view camera 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.210
 the shield card seen 70 in the wet 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.150
 we did not see anything 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.980
 I'll say a chance to simulate 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.780
 We sometimes rain it usually does that 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.450
 automatically search over the rain 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:26.100
 by now that not for years 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.480
 son not living seems a manually 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.320
 man the sail by and just look 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:35.550
 from how he reacts and if he reacts 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.550
 if a nice and over 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.019
 70 okay when wet 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.870
 but now he can not only recognize 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.430
 what happen sooner then detects 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.359
 what happens behind me is his name 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.879
 can be a threatening rear impact 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:53.989
 recognize 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:56.209
 that means if I am at the traffic light now 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.400
 for example, stand and come behind me 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.549
 and made to and that is the na 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.170
 this will be chaplain in which he is very fast 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.909
 the hazard warning lights make you that is 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.469
 You do not notice who this is cold and behind us 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:08.689
 on it, the mur pulls on the brake 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:10.340
 why not we in the one 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:12.799
 Cross-traffic pushed in a crossroads 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.599
 stand or if we are now a park 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.970
 So car is with that I'm not there 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.590
 clean then give it up ok now we do so as 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.109
 we would sit in it in the car 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.519
 just not here and now to see whole times 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:22.879
 how the following traffic changed I was 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.620
 towards it 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:31.820
 First of all, you were seen that way and 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:34.290
 So yes, a big help 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.760
 Now you can also change the distance automatically 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.690
 to the preceding vehicle hold 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.190
 Look, I can do that 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.290
 speed set between 30 and 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.710
 200 km h like a distance radar here 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.430
 ahead 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:45.630
 well there's offered from the grill in the grill and 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.880
 I set the speed to 40 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.080
 km / h to the foot of the gas pedal and brake 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.340
 and I do not do anything now 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.030
 in addition to another distracts 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.770
 assistants 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.410
 that means he keeps me in automatically 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.580
 the trail helps me with gentle turns 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.860
 by not having any 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.360
 road markings have thereby 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.280
 now have no road markings 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.540
 I orientated to 60 km h in the 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.200
 preceding vehicles 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.200
 Yes 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.329
 look at the vehicle for us 

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:12.329
 brakes 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:20.709
 yes vehicle it can be after that they are 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.930
 that can be ok until the standstill 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.979
 Of course, a cool thing 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.180
 do you have any frank is that 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:27.400
 but everything works only with 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.270
 automatic transmission cvt gear not 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.270
 right
