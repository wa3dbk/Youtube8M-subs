today<00:00:04.410> we're<00:00:04.620> gonna<00:00:04.770> show<00:00:05.460> you<00:00:05.490> how<00:00:05.700> to

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
today we're gonna show you how to

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:06.650 
today we're gonna show you how to
correctly

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
correctly

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.830 
correctly
align<00:00:07.049> your<00:00:07.440> pads<00:00:08.010> caliper<00:00:08.849> with<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.570> rotor

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
align your pads caliper with the rotor

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.379 
align your pads caliper with the rotor
it's<00:00:10.769> very<00:00:10.980> important<00:00:11.580> that<00:00:11.849> you<00:00:12.269> get

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
it's very important that you get

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.390 
it's very important that you get
everything<00:00:12.719> doing<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.530> same<00:00:13.740> amount<00:00:13.920> of<00:00:14.160> work

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
everything doing the same amount of work

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.050 
everything doing the same amount of work
quite<00:00:14.969> often<00:00:15.470> you<00:00:16.470> find<00:00:16.740> that<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.490> caliper

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
quite often you find that the caliper

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.109 
quite often you find that the caliper
and<00:00:18.359> pads<00:00:18.779> are<00:00:19.230> very<00:00:19.850> misaligned<00:00:20.850> with<00:00:20.970> a

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
and pads are very misaligned with a

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.170 
and pads are very misaligned with a
rotor<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.779> you<00:00:21.840> find<00:00:22.109> that<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.260> piston<00:00:22.830> is

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
rotor and you find that a piston is

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.990 
rotor and you find that a piston is
doing<00:00:24.180> too<00:00:24.359> much<00:00:24.539> work<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.609> they're<00:00:26.609> not<00:00:26.789> both

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
doing too much work and they're not both

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.839 
doing too much work and they're not both
coming<00:00:27.359> out<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.750> meet<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.560> rotor<00:00:28.849> correctly

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
coming out to meet the rotor correctly

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.799 
coming out to meet the rotor correctly
so<00:00:30.750> what<00:00:31.470> we're<00:00:31.619> going<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.800> show<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.809> the

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
so what we're going to show you is the

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.270 
so what we're going to show you is the
way<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.110> correctly<00:00:34.739> align<00:00:35.190> your<00:00:35.969> pads<00:00:37.129> the<00:00:38.129> way

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
way to correctly align your pads the way

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.580 
way to correctly align your pads the way
you<00:00:38.340> do<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.760> basically<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:40.110> start<00:00:40.350> by

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
you do that basically you start by

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.630 
you do that basically you start by
pushing<00:00:40.950> your<00:00:42.620> Pistons<00:00:43.620> back<00:00:43.860> very<00:00:44.190> gently<00:00:44.250> to

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
pushing your Pistons back very gently to

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.330 
pushing your Pistons back very gently to
get<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.879> very<00:00:45.059> small<00:00:45.360> screwdriver<00:00:45.930> just<00:00:46.920> ease

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
get a very small screwdriver just ease

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.560 
get a very small screwdriver just ease
the<00:00:47.399> screwdriver<00:00:48.329> in<00:00:48.570> between<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.079> pad<00:00:49.440> and

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
the screwdriver in between the pad and

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.540 
the screwdriver in between the pad and
the<00:00:51.570> piston<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.260> just<00:00:52.620> gently<00:00:52.920> push<00:00:53.520> the

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
the piston and just gently push the

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.479 
the piston and just gently push the
pistons<00:00:54.300> back<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:55.289> they're<00:00:55.440> fully<00:00:55.739> retracted

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
pistons back so they're fully retracted

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.510 
pistons back so they're fully retracted
into<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.210> caliper<00:00:57.620> I'll<00:00:58.620> give<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.039> break

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
into the caliper I'll give you a break

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.459 
into the caliper I'll give you a break
obviously<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.329> wheel<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.629> are<00:01:00.960> run<00:01:01.199> very

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
obviously a wheel that are run very

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.509 
obviously a wheel that are run very
freely<00:01:02.480> like<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.629> get<00:01:03.840> both<00:01:04.439> Pistons<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.250> come

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
freely like to get both Pistons to come

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.660 
freely like to get both Pistons to come
out<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.000> meet<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.869> pad<00:01:07.140> equally<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.369> pads

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
out and meet the pad equally so the pads

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.250 
out and meet the pad equally so the pads
hit<00:01:08.970> both<00:01:09.810> sides<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.409> disk<00:01:10.680> properly<00:01:12.260> take

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
hit both sides of the disk properly take

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.460 
hit both sides of the disk properly take
your<00:01:13.439> screwdriver<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.460> your<00:01:15.299> brake<00:01:15.900> front<00:01:16.320> or

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
your screwdriver and your brake front or

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.340 
your screwdriver and your brake front or
rear<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.799> depends<00:01:17.100> which<00:01:17.250> ones<00:01:17.490> you're<00:01:17.670> doing

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
rear it depends which ones you're doing

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.910 
rear it depends which ones you're doing
gently<00:01:19.350> depress<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.430> lever<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:21.470> look<00:01:22.470> at

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
gently depress the lever and look at

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.200 
gently depress the lever and look at
which<00:01:24.439> piston<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.680> beginning<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.790> actuate

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
which piston is beginning to actuate

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.929 
which piston is beginning to actuate
quicker<00:01:27.840> than<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.530> other<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.100> just<00:01:29.130> slightly

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
quicker than the other and just slightly

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:30.890 
quicker than the other and just slightly
hold<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.479> back

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
hold it back

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.399 
hold it back
so<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.590> other<00:01:31.740> piston<00:01:32.310> can<00:01:32.520> catch<00:01:32.790> up<00:01:33.259> if<00:01:34.259> you

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
so the other piston can catch up if you

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.850 
so the other piston can catch up if you
do<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.799> equally<00:01:35.400> on<00:01:35.640> both<00:01:36.180> sides<00:01:36.860> you'll

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
do that equally on both sides you'll

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.300 
do that equally on both sides you'll
find<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:39.770> door

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
find the door

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.840 
find the door
Pat's<00:01:43.270> will<00:01:43.659> meet<00:01:43.960> the<00:01:44.170> rotor<00:01:44.640> exactly<00:01:45.640> in<00:01:45.760> the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
Pat's will meet the rotor exactly in the

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.140 
Pat's will meet the rotor exactly in the
middle<00:01:46.030> give<00:01:46.810> you<00:01:46.960> no<00:01:47.860> path<00:01:48.159> contacts<00:01:48.970> with

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
middle give you no path contacts with

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.270 
middle give you no path contacts with
the<00:01:49.299> disk<00:01:49.570> and<00:01:50.500> they'll<00:01:50.710> give<00:01:50.860> you<00:01:50.890> a<00:01:51.040> very

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
the disk and they'll give you a very

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.210 
the disk and they'll give you a very
good<00:01:51.369> solid<00:01:52.150> lever<00:01:52.420> feel<00:01:52.840> it's<00:01:53.799> probably<00:01:54.100> one

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
good solid lever feel it's probably one

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.340 
good solid lever feel it's probably one
of<00:01:54.250> the<00:01:54.400> most<00:01:54.490> important<00:01:55.060> things<00:01:55.270> with<00:01:56.080> brakes

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
of the most important things with brakes

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.620 
of the most important things with brakes
is<00:01:56.530> to<00:01:56.680> make<00:01:57.040> sure<00:01:57.250> that<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:57.909> Pistons<00:01:58.330> been

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
is to make sure that the Pistons been

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.280 
is to make sure that the Pistons been
doing<00:01:58.899> exactly<00:01:59.020> the<00:01:59.500> same<00:01:59.530> that<00:01:59.950> work
