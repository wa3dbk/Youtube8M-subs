 hi to all your kids in there 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.769
 this new video we will see the unboxing 

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:14.599
 of the max iq 220 s a heat sink a 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.829
 liwan liquid of n max 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.020
 the sink is a tribute to the 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:20.120
 enermax that I thank you find the links to 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.620
 site on the Facebook description page 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.030
 I recommend you tell us if 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.060
 you want to leave a nice like 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.410
 we are doing it shortly with unboxing 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.180
 well guys here we are with the box 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.920
 containing the heat sink all around 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.419
 as always we have various images and 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.400
 information in the back 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.980
 we can see some features 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.350
 the various image sizes and 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.090
 heatsink specifications while in the 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.220
 front part we have an image of the 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.150
 heat sink and the model we pass 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.150
 now at the unboxing 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.710
 inside we have a booklet with 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.360
 instructions and guarantee a box 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.280
 containing all the accessories for the 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.280
 montage that we will see better in a while 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.500
 two 120 mm fans 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.940
 and to finish the sink we pass 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.970
 now to see everything in detail in the 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.860
 detail we have two 120 mm fans 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:51.420
 universal backplate for intel sockets 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:55.290
 lga775 11 50 11 55 11 56 13 66 and people 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.899
 times m2m ii plus m three m3 class fn1 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.910
 and fm2 brackets for socket and i 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.619
 arms for intel sockets and that though 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.130
 we find already mounted on the water block 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.950
 thickness for intel sockets lga775 I saw 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.830
 for socket intel lga2011 viveur 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.260
 backplate often in plastic data with 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.200
 insulating adhesive integrated springs for i 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.870
 backplate I saw for fan screws for the 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.040
 fixing to the caze molex for pump in the 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.320
 in which case we did not want to use 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.420
 leader on the motherboard cable with 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.760
 connector or four fins split ad 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.830
 y in two 4-way connectors for 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.760
 power the fans and finally syringe 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.950
 of thermal paste 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.600
 let's now go to the sink we see 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.260
 some specifications and dimensions of the 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.769
 radiator height 154 mm width 120 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.390
 thickness 27 smooth tubes 300 mm long that 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.850
 connect radiators and water blocks 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.470
 materials the area aluminum radiator 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.329
 of the water block in copper contact 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.610
 of the front and back of the 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.260
 radiator are present in total 8 holes 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.120
 four for each side for mounting 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.840
 of the fans the fixing of the radiator 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.850
 arcade 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.650
 also on the sides we find the covers in 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.690
 aluminum bearing the enermax logo 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.579
 the radiator water block are 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.220
 connected by and two smooth tubes from 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:07.140
 300 mm in vacuum the block we can 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.329
 see the contact area with the ACI more 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.250
 copper and we can see the eight screws 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:13.079
 which close the perfect waterblock for 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.700
 avoid any kind of spillage 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.799
 in the front we have the place 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.510
 of the enermax with around four LEDs 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.579
 of white color that will light up 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.440
 in my opinion when the pump is running 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.030
 very beautiful to see in the part 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.370
 top we can see the cable of 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.959
 power supply with 3 pin connector and both 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.030
 on this side it is on the opposite one 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.010
 we can see two screws that block i 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.810
 mounting brackets for this 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.610
 case towards katyn tel on the right side 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.970
 we have the attack of the tubes that can 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.350
 to be 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.730
 booked to better adapt to 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:43.530
 configuration in which the 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:45.360
 heat sink will be mounted on one side 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.950
 finally we have the switch 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.680
 for speed control three 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.380
 levels in this case silent from a 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:58.160
 minimum of 1,500 to a maximum of 1200 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:04:01.920
 rpm minimum performance 500 maximum 1600 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.720
 and finally overclock minimum 500 maximum 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.540
 two thousand what can we say about this 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.670
 heatsink with a 758 ai 20k 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.860
 overclocked to 4.2 GHz the 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.570
 temperatures are around 64 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.950
 however, remember that 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.690
 temperatures also vary based on 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.370
 the environmental one that started with cables 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.019
 etc. then every result goes 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.060
 assessed taking into account these too 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.890
 factors on the aesthetic and product side for 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.810
 as far as the radiator is concerned 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.730
 well thanks to the side covers that 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.710
 bear the enermax logo on 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.419
 waterblock instead has some LEDs 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.280
 white color that make it too 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.230
 thanks to the particular design and quite a lot 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.030
 pleasant personal note for the fans 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.070
 with batwing design and that is to the di 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.320
 bat as you know I'm a fan 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.300
 scathing of batman and that design for me 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.160
 turns out to be a very welcome addition 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.900
 obviously it's not just a feature 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.669
 aesthetic as the particular design 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.620
 and also serves to improve air flow 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:51.990
 as for the noise level with the 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.700
 fans at most 2000 rpm results 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.440
 quite annoying then less than 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.419
 marco patch test hardly it 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.010
 you will keep at maximum in daily use 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:01.200
 I personally recommend the profile 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.700
 silent that as shown by the name and a 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.110
 profile 8 to guarantee great 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.250
 silence but in any case 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.110
 as the temperature increases 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.729
 will also increase the speed of the 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.530
 fans always trying however to 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:12.240
 maintain a certain acoustic comfort 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.190
 as for the performances are 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.380
 very good nothing to say under this 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.240
 appearance we come to the defects the noise 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.800
 from element of the maximum regime and i 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.930
 switch to change the speed of the 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.310
 fans the noise is a very flaw 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.350
 relatively as it is one 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.210
 consequence of 2,000 revolutions of rotations 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.590
 per minute for switches 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.630
 instead these are found directly 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.070
 on the fans so every time 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.380
 we want to change to the maximum speed 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.289
 we must necessarily open the case 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.360
 it is a jesus 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:38.919
 I personally think it would have been 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.229
 much easier and useful to use 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:42.819
 of an adapter or extension to insert 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:44.139
 in the expansion slots here is the 

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:45.969
 express behind arcade 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:47.199
 ultimately we are talking about 

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:49.389
 an excellent all in one heat sink 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:51.490
 very good performance aesthetically 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:53.589
 very nice especially the design of the 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.629
 fans and quiet enough during 

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:57.099
 the use of silent mode well 

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:59.289
 boys the heat sink unboxing 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:00.999
 ends here you can find it online at 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:02.619
 a price of around 60 euros 

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:04.240
