just<00:01:34.770> yet<00:01:34.860> because<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.549> just<00:01:35.700> would<00:01:35.820> have

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
just yet because it just would have

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.670 
just yet because it just would have
taken<00:01:36.000> too<00:01:36.360> much<00:01:36.540> time<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.990> it's<00:01:37.320> better<00:01:37.530> than

taken too much time and it's better than

taken too much time and it's better than
it's<00:01:37.829> coming<00:01:38.070> out<00:01:38.159> on<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.400> next-gen<00:01:38.729> consoles

it's coming out on the next-gen consoles

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.120 
it's coming out on the next-gen consoles
anyways<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:39.960> they<00:01:40.079> could<00:01:40.290> have<00:01:40.409> added<00:01:40.560> all<00:01:40.920> the

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
anyways so they could have added all the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.399 
anyways so they could have added all the
atoms<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.549> make<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.729> first-person<00:01:42.299> mode<00:01:42.509> level

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
atoms to make a first-person mode level

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.020 
atoms to make a first-person mode level
that<00:01:43.649> they<00:01:43.740> wanted<00:01:44.130> but<00:01:44.369> they<00:01:44.490> weren't<00:01:44.880> sure

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
that they wanted but they weren't sure

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.969 
that they wanted but they weren't sure
if<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.420> world<00:01:45.630> would<00:01:45.810> have<00:01:45.960> held<00:01:46.170> up<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.799> way

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
if the world would have held up the way

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.280 
if the world would have held up the way
they'd<00:01:47.159> have<00:01:47.250> wanted<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.850> in<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.630> last<00:01:48.899> gen

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
they'd have wanted to in the last gen

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.139 
they'd have wanted to in the last gen
and<00:01:49.470> current<00:01:50.009> gen<00:01:50.189> because<00:01:50.640> there's<00:01:50.790> so<00:01:51.000> much

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
and current gen because there's so much

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.060 
and current gen because there's so much
more<00:01:51.420> available<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.810> us<00:01:52.079> in<00:01:52.259> terms<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.860> memory

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
more available to us in terms of memory

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.920 
more available to us in terms of memory
in<00:01:53.280> terms<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.640> power<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:54.149> these<00:01:54.360> next<00:01:54.780> gen

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
in terms of power in these next gen

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.020 
in terms of power in these next gen
consoles<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.560> guess<00:01:55.979> current<00:01:56.369> yet<00:01:56.579> now<00:01:56.729> they

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
consoles I guess current yet now they

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.880 
consoles I guess current yet now they
were<00:01:57.090> able<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.450> make<00:01:57.600> first-person<00:01:58.469> mode<00:01:58.500> a

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
were able to make first-person mode a

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.100 
were able to make first-person mode a
thing<00:01:59.369> in<00:01:59.549> these<00:01:59.850> next<00:02:00.060> gen<00:02:00.299> consoles<00:02:00.750> so

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
thing in these next gen consoles so

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.690 
thing in these next gen consoles so
that's<00:02:01.259> pretty<00:02:01.409> much<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.740> guys<00:02:01.920> first<00:02:02.280> person

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
that's pretty much it guys first person

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.670 
that's pretty much it guys first person
had<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.090> be<00:02:03.210> rebuilt<00:02:03.479> from<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.930> ground<00:02:04.020> up

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
had to be rebuilt from the ground up

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.289 
had to be rebuilt from the ground up
Rockstar<00:02:05.280> didn't<00:02:05.460> just<00:02:05.700> implement<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.270> know

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
Rockstar didn't just implement you know
