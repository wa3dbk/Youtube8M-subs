going<00:04:07.269> to<00:04:07.329> make<00:04:07.569> your<00:04:07.810> Kinect<00:04:08.260> more<00:04:08.739> sensitive

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
going to make your Kinect more sensitive

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.259 
going to make your Kinect more sensitive
to<00:04:10.510> just<00:04:10.840> your<00:04:11.049> voice<00:04:11.230> and<00:04:11.709> it's<00:04:12.069> not<00:04:12.760> going<00:04:13.180> to

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
to just your voice and it's not going to

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:14.849 
to just your voice and it's not going to
cut<00:04:13.480> you<00:04:13.690> off<00:04:13.720> at<00:04:14.079> all<00:04:14.230> because<00:04:14.470> it<00:04:14.709> has

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:14.859 
cut you off at all because it has

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:17.819 
cut you off at all because it has
nothing<00:04:15.190> to<00:04:15.220> cut<00:04:15.489> off<00:04:15.669> so<00:04:16.320> let's<00:04:17.320> just<00:04:17.530> go<00:04:17.799> over

don't know why this is just where it
works<00:05:03.640> but<00:05:03.940> pretty<00:05:04.270> much<00:05:04.420> these<00:05:04.570> red<00:05:04.780> lights

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
works but pretty much these red lights

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.440 
works but pretty much these red lights
here<00:05:05.320> that's<00:05:05.950> what<00:05:06.220> that's<00:05:06.850> what<00:05:07.000> I<00:05:07.030> surround

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
get real close to this control over here

00:05:17.650 --> 00:06:10.010 
get real close to this control over here
because<00:05:17.830> I<00:05:17.890> need<00:05:18.040> two<00:05:18.220> hands<00:05:18.460> so<00:05:18.669> hold<00:05:19.060> tight

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.830 

and<00:06:10.410> that's<00:06:10.710> it<00:06:10.890> sounds<00:06:11.460> great<00:06:11.640> now<00:06:11.880> a<00:06:12.300> couple

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
and that's it sounds great now a couple

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.570 
and that's it sounds great now a couple
of<00:06:12.930> notes<00:06:13.110> every<00:06:13.500> headsets<00:06:13.950> different<00:06:14.400> I've

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 
of notes every headsets different I've

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.280 
of notes every headsets different I've
got<00:06:14.610> these<00:06:14.940> maxed<00:06:15.390> out<00:06:15.540> but<00:06:15.750> they're<00:06:15.900> cheapy

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:16.290 
got these maxed out but they're cheapy

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:17.810 
got these maxed out but they're cheapy
so<00:06:16.590> the<00:06:16.950> sounds<00:06:17.250> going<00:06:17.370> to<00:06:17.460> be<00:06:17.520> a<00:06:17.550> little<00:06:17.700> bit

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:17.820 
so the sounds going to be a little bit

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.120 
so the sounds going to be a little bit
different<00:06:18.150> that<00:06:18.180> it's<00:06:18.360> calibrating<00:06:18.870> from<00:06:19.130> you

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.130 
different that it's calibrating from you

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:21.410 
different that it's calibrating from you
may<00:06:20.250> have<00:06:20.370> to<00:06:20.490> adjust<00:06:20.580> your<00:06:20.880> volume<00:06:21.000> a<00:06:21.210> little

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:21.420 
may have to adjust your volume a little

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:25.120 
may have to adjust your volume a little
bit<00:06:21.540> also<00:06:22.050> your<00:06:23.040> distance<00:06:23.490> from<00:06:23.670> the<00:06:23.880> Kinect

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:25.130 
bit also your distance from the Kinect

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.680 
bit also your distance from the Kinect
even<00:06:26.130> though<00:06:26.250> it's<00:06:26.460> calibrated<00:06:27.030> to<00:06:27.330> hear<00:06:27.660> a

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:27.690 
even though it's calibrated to hear a

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:30.080 
even though it's calibrated to hear a
noise<00:06:27.960> that<00:06:28.320> it<00:06:28.440> needs<00:06:28.620> to<00:06:28.710> cancel<00:06:29.010> out<00:06:29.370> there

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.090 
noise that it needs to cancel out there

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.370 
noise that it needs to cancel out there
is<00:06:30.240> no<00:06:30.480> noise<00:06:30.660> because<00:06:31.020> it's<00:06:31.170> in<00:06:31.260> your

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:31.380 
is no noise because it's in your

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.200 
is no noise because it's in your
headphones<00:06:31.770> so<00:06:32.190> it's<00:06:32.520> just<00:06:32.850> going<00:06:33.060> to<00:06:33.120> be

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.210 
headphones so it's just going to be

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.540 
headphones so it's just going to be
hearing<00:06:33.420> your<00:06:33.600> voice<00:06:33.780> you<00:06:34.650> speak<00:06:34.980> normal

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:35.550 
hearing your voice you speak normal

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.490 
hearing your voice you speak normal
natural<00:06:36.300> and<00:06:36.540> you're<00:06:36.690> going<00:06:36.840> to<00:06:36.870> sound<00:06:37.110> great

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:37.500 
natural and you're going to sound great

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:39.630 
now there are a couple of things a few

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.600 
now there are a couple of things a few
people<00:06:39.930> have<00:06:40.020> said<00:06:40.200> I<00:06:40.470> sound<00:06:41.100> like<00:06:41.190> I'm<00:06:41.400> blown

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:41.610 
people have said I sound like I'm blown

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.120 
people have said I sound like I'm blown
out<00:06:41.850> if<00:06:42.480> I<00:06:42.720> get<00:06:42.780> excited<00:06:43.290> are<00:06:43.560> four<00:06:43.710> raise<00:06:43.860> my

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:44.130 
out if I get excited are four raise my

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:45.740 
out if I get excited are four raise my
voice<00:06:44.310> or<00:06:44.640> from<00:06:44.790> yelling<00:06:45.000> at<00:06:45.150> someone<00:06:45.390> for<00:06:45.510> not

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:45.750 
voice or from yelling at someone for not

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:47.870 
voice or from yelling at someone for not
taking<00:06:45.870> the<00:06:46.050> ejected<00:06:46.650> or<00:06:46.830> it<00:06:47.400> gets<00:06:47.610> a<00:06:47.760> little

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:47.880 
taking the ejected or it gets a little

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.270 
taking the ejected or it gets a little
distorted<00:06:48.270> because<00:06:48.630> the<00:06:49.110> mic<00:06:49.290> is<00:06:49.500> incredibly

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:50.280 
distorted because the mic is incredibly

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.640 
distorted because the mic is incredibly
sensitive<00:06:50.550> so<00:06:51.180> just<00:06:51.690> talk<00:06:51.900> at<00:06:52.050> a<00:06:52.110> normal<00:06:52.470> pace

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.650 
sensitive so just talk at a normal pace

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.680 
sensitive so just talk at a normal pace
and<00:06:53.040> you'll<00:06:53.280> be<00:06:53.460> okay

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:54.690 
and you'll be okay

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:56.270 
and you'll be okay
there's<00:06:55.110> still<00:06:55.290> a<00:06:55.320> few<00:06:55.560> tweaks<00:06:55.890> you<00:06:56.130> might

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.280

there's still a few tweaks you might
want<00:06:56.490> to<00:06:56.550> do<00:06:57.110> perhaps<00:06:58.110> when<00:06:58.380> it<00:06:58.500> does<00:06:58.650> the

00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 
want to do perhaps when it does the

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.770 
want to do perhaps when it does the
microphone<00:06:59.340> calibration<00:07:00.210> you<00:07:00.390> might<00:07:00.570> want<00:07:00.750> to

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:00.780 
microphone calibration you might want to

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.410 
microphone calibration you might want to
pull<00:07:00.960> your<00:07:01.080> headset<00:07:01.470> away<00:07:01.830> so<00:07:01.890> the<00:07:02.430> Kinect<00:07:03.270> is

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:06.330 
completely free but few little tricks

completely free but few little tricks
you<00:07:06.600> can<00:07:06.780> try<00:07:07.080> to<00:07:07.140> maybe<00:07:07.560> sound<00:07:07.950> better<00:07:08.220> but

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:08.460 
you can try to maybe sound better but

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.070 
you can try to maybe sound better but
the<00:07:08.580> only<00:07:08.700> way<00:07:08.880> you're<00:07:09.030> going<00:07:09.150> to<00:07:09.180> know<00:07:09.390> is<00:07:09.750> if
