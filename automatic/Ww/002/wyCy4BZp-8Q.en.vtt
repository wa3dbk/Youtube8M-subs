00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.069 
first go pretty much impossible I'm
doing<00:01:59.549> short<00:01:59.880> increments<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.570> then<00:02:00.689> linking

doing short increments and then linking
them<00:02:01.229> together<00:02:01.380> is<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.740> lot<00:02:02.009> easier<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.759> what

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:03.359 
them together is a lot easier and what

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:05.889 
them together is a lot easier and what
more<00:02:03.509> precise<00:02:03.929> we<00:02:04.140> get<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.499> desired<00:02:04.890> shape

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
more precise we get the desired shape

anything the sorts pointed because then

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:15.360 
anything the sorts pointed because then
it's<00:02:14.340> very<00:02:14.430> restore
