discouraging to the point where you
might<00:00:35.040> just<00:00:35.280> give<00:00:35.520> up<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:35.790> say<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.030> know<00:00:36.270> what

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
might just give up and say you know what

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.560 
might just give up and say you know what
this<00:00:37.050> isn't<00:00:37.530> for<00:00:37.680> me<00:00:37.790> which<00:00:38.790> has<00:00:39.090> been<00:00:39.420> the

experience of so many people because

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.350 
experience of so many people because
they<00:00:42.930> get<00:00:43.110> overwhelmed<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.180> because<00:00:45.180> they

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
they get overwhelmed and because they

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.410 
they get overwhelmed and because they
make<00:00:45.629> this<00:00:46.170> big<00:00:46.890> process<00:00:47.340> bigger<00:00:48.059> than<00:00:48.270> what

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
make this big process bigger than what

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.090 
make this big process bigger than what
it<00:00:48.450> really<00:00:48.539> has<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:48.960> be<00:00:49.260> instead<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.739> attacking

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
it really has to be instead of attacking

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.180 
it really has to be instead of attacking
it<00:00:50.460> with<00:00:50.940> small<00:00:51.410> sections<00:00:52.410> that<00:00:52.649> they<00:00:52.860> can

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
it with small sections that they can

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.270 
it with small sections that they can
achieve<00:00:54.230> here's<00:00:55.230> here's<00:00:55.590> one<00:00:55.829> thing<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.250> I

achieve here's here's one thing that I
would<00:00:56.399> really<00:00:56.850> recommend<00:00:57.260> when<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.379> comes<00:00:58.710> to

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
would really recommend when it comes to
