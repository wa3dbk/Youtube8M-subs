pattern which is rare when it comes to
GTA<00:01:22.950> clothes<00:01:23.310> but<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:24.090> actually<00:01:24.330> looks<00:01:24.509> pretty

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
GTA clothes but it actually looks pretty

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.420 
GTA clothes but it actually looks pretty
cool<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.290> especially<00:01:25.619> if<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:26.009> like<00:01:26.159> using

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
cool and especially if you like using

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.910 
cool and especially if you like using
the<00:01:26.909> regular<00:01:27.450> sniper<00:01:28.140> rifle<00:01:28.470> like<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.710> first

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
the regular sniper rifle like the first

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.649 
the regular sniper rifle like the first
one<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.189> unlocked<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.880> goes<00:01:30.240> really<00:01:30.540> well

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
one you unlocked that goes really well

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.630 
one you unlocked that goes really well
with<00:01:30.810> this<00:01:31.049> outfit<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.710> this<00:01:31.860> may<00:01:32.040> not<00:01:32.189> be<00:01:32.250> one

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
with this outfit and this may not be one

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.370 
with this outfit and this may not be one
of<00:01:32.729> your<00:01:32.880> main<00:01:33.299> outfits<00:01:33.840> but<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.020> think<00:01:34.200> it's<00:01:34.290> a

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
of your main outfits but I think it's a

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.230 
of your main outfits but I think it's a
fun<00:01:34.590> outfit<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.100> use<00:01:35.220> especially<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.909> know<00:01:36.030> if

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.370 
like you know you would see I mean the
farmer<00:02:44.300> look<00:02:44.540> that's<00:02:44.750> sort<00:02:44.990> of<00:02:45.050> just<00:02:45.110> a

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380

different<00:02:45.830> take<00:02:46.100> on<00:02:46.130> I<00:02:46.610> guess<00:02:46.820> the<00:02:47.090> zombie

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
different take on I guess the zombie

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.210 
different take on I guess the zombie
look<00:02:47.690> and<00:02:47.960> I<00:02:48.050> personally<00:02:48.410> think<00:02:48.530> it's<00:02:48.830> really

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
look and I personally think it's really

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
three we have a outfit that this one

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.280 
three we have a outfit that this one
actually<00:02:55.760> takes<00:02:55.910> a<00:02:56.120> few<00:02:56.600> glitches<00:02:56.840> to<00:02:57.140> make

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
actually takes a few glitches to make

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.590 
actually takes a few glitches to make
but<00:02:57.560> I<00:02:57.590> think<00:02:57.950> it<00:02:58.130> looks<00:02:58.490> amazing<00:02:58.910> once<00:02:59.450> you're

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
but I think it looks amazing once you're

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.720 
but I think it looks amazing once you're
done<00:02:59.780> with<00:02:59.930> it<00:03:00.110> it's<00:03:00.620> called<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:01.070> World<00:03:01.310> War<00:03:01.490> 2

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
soldier although I guess it really could

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.620 
soldier although I guess it really could
be<00:03:03.530> any<00:03:03.800> soldier<00:03:04.250> but<00:03:04.460> to<00:03:04.910> make<00:03:05.090> this<00:03:05.240> outfit

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
once you walk out you should have

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.160 
once you walk out you should have
everything<00:04:01.360> equipped<00:04:02.360> I<00:04:02.570> know<00:04:02.660> it's<00:04:02.900> kind<00:04:03.110> of

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
everything equipped I know it's kind of

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.050 
everything equipped I know it's kind of
confusing<00:04:03.350> but<00:04:04.130> if<00:04:04.250> you<00:04:04.340> remember<00:04:04.760> some<00:04:04.970> of

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
confusing but if you remember some of

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.460 
confusing but if you remember some of
the<00:04:05.120> old<00:04:05.300> glitches<00:04:05.720> it'll<00:04:06.080> kind<00:04:06.350> of<00:04:06.410> make

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
the old glitches it'll kind of make

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.770 
the old glitches it'll kind of make
sense<00:04:06.739> but<00:04:07.040> once<00:04:07.610> you<00:04:07.700> have<00:04:07.880> that<00:04:08.030> that<00:04:08.510> is<00:04:08.660> the

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
sense but once you have that that is the

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.570 
sense but once you have that that is the
outfit<00:04:09.140> it<00:04:09.350> actually<00:04:09.800> looks<00:04:09.950> really<00:04:10.040> cool<00:04:10.400> I

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
outfit it actually looks really cool I

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.150 
outfit it actually looks really cool I
really<00:04:10.610> like<00:04:11.060> the<00:04:11.330> way<00:04:11.450> the<00:04:11.660> tube<00:04:11.959> connects<00:04:12.890> or

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
really like the way the tube connects or

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.729 
really like the way the tube connects or
somewhat<00:04:13.610> connects<00:04:13.970> with<00:04:14.209> the<00:04:14.450> the<00:04:15.170> gas<00:04:15.380> mask

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
somewhat connects with the the gas mask

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:17.530 
somewhat connects with the the gas mask
and<00:04:16.070> then<00:04:16.459> obviously<00:04:16.669> just<00:04:16.910> add<00:04:17.180> in<00:04:17.269> the<00:04:17.359> black

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
and then obviously just add in the black

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.080 
and then obviously just add in the black
helmet<00:04:17.870> on<00:04:17.930> top<00:04:18.140> so<00:04:18.470> sort<00:04:18.950> of<00:04:19.070> make<00:04:19.760> it<00:04:19.940> that

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
helmet on top so sort of make it that

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.570 
helmet on top so sort of make it that
soldier<00:04:20.600> feel<00:04:20.930> I<00:04:21.230> think<00:04:21.590> this<00:04:21.710> one<00:04:21.890> is<00:04:21.919> one<00:04:22.550> of

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
soldier feel I think this one is one of

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.040 
soldier feel I think this one is one of
the<00:04:22.729> coolest<00:04:22.970> soldier<00:04:23.419> outfits<00:04:23.750> we've<00:04:23.900> done

the one in the game it's just not

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.620 
the one in the game it's just not
possible<00:04:48.040> but<00:04:48.880> I<00:04:48.940> think<00:04:49.090> it<00:04:49.360> turned<00:04:49.540> out

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
possible but I think it turned out

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.720

same glitch that we just did with the
soda<00:05:10.390> machine<00:05:10.740> it's<00:05:11.740> fairly<00:05:12.010> easy<00:05:12.280> to<00:05:12.370> do<00:05:12.610> and

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
soda machine it's fairly easy to do and

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.760 
soda machine it's fairly easy to do and
I'll<00:05:13.360> go<00:05:13.480> ahead<00:05:13.750> and<00:05:13.870> put<00:05:14.020> up<00:05:14.050> the<00:05:14.140> picture<00:05:14.590> on

I'll go ahead and put up the picture on

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.290 
I'll go ahead and put up the picture on
the<00:05:14.890> screen<00:05:15.160> of<00:05:15.340> what<00:05:15.550> it<00:05:15.640> looks<00:05:15.820> like<00:05:15.940> in<00:05:16.180> the

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
the screen of what it looks like in the

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.050 
the screen of what it looks like in the
game<00:05:16.570> and<00:05:16.890> the<00:05:17.890> colors<00:05:18.250> are<00:05:18.460> completely<00:05:18.640> off

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
game and the colors are completely off

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.850 
game and the colors are completely off
obviously<00:05:19.570> this<00:05:19.720> one<00:05:19.900> in<00:05:20.050> GTA<00:05:20.320> is<00:05:20.350> all<00:05:20.590> black

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
obviously this one in GTA is all black

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.620 
obviously this one in GTA is all black
we<00:05:21.160> don't<00:05:21.370> have<00:05:21.610> the<00:05:21.790> colors<00:05:22.060> to<00:05:22.210> make<00:05:22.330> it<00:05:22.480> like

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
we don't have the colors to make it like

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.410 
we don't have the colors to make it like
the<00:05:22.780> one<00:05:22.960> in<00:05:23.200> the<00:05:23.770> game<00:05:23.980> which<00:05:24.490> you<00:05:24.640> can<00:05:24.940> do<00:05:25.120> and

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.420 
the one in the game which you can do and

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.630 
the one in the game which you can do and
I<00:05:25.600> might<00:05:25.780> show<00:05:26.050> this<00:05:26.230> you<00:05:26.890> can<00:05:27.070> switch<00:05:27.340> up<00:05:27.370> the

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:27.640 
I might show this you can switch up the

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.030 
I might show this you can switch up the
pants<00:05:28.000> to<00:05:28.180> make<00:05:28.330> it<00:05:28.420> sort<00:05:28.570> of<00:05:28.660> a<00:05:28.750> tan<00:05:29.140> jean

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:30.040 
pants to make it sort of a tan jean

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.190 
pants to make it sort of a tan jean
pants<00:05:30.580> if<00:05:30.730> you<00:05:30.760> wanted<00:05:31.210> to<00:05:31.390> I<00:05:31.630> mean<00:05:32.080> obviously

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
pants if you wanted to I mean obviously

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.600 
pants if you wanted to I mean obviously
that's<00:05:32.560> up<00:05:32.740> to<00:05:32.860> you<00:05:32.950> can<00:05:33.100> mess<00:05:33.220> around<00:05:33.370> with

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
that's up to you can mess around with

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.180 
that's up to you can mess around with
that<00:05:33.790> yourself<00:05:34.600> but<00:05:34.900> personally<00:05:35.710> I<00:05:35.740> think<00:05:35.920> the

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
that yourself but personally I think the

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.980 
that yourself but personally I think the
black<00:05:36.430> all-black<00:05:36.940> looks<00:05:37.270> the<00:05:37.540> best<00:05:37.690> just

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
black all-black looks the best just

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.440 
black all-black looks the best just
because<00:05:38.290> it<00:05:38.560> matches<00:05:38.830> and<00:05:39.340> everything<00:05:40.210> goes

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.450 
because it matches and everything goes

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.390 
because it matches and everything goes
together<00:05:40.660> and<00:05:41.110> maybe<00:05:41.770> you<00:05:41.890> can<00:05:42.010> just<00:05:42.100> imagine

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
together and maybe you can just imagine

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.850 
together and maybe you can just imagine
it<00:05:42.700> as<00:05:42.880> you<00:05:43.030> know<00:05:43.150> pre-war<00:05:43.690> I<00:05:44.110> guess<00:05:44.350> fallout
