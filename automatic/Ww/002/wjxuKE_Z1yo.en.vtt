what have you but um so did the problem

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.210 
what have you but um so did the problem
is<00:02:06.119> that<00:02:06.149> he<00:02:06.780> said<00:02:07.380> these<00:02:07.530> are<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.770> evens<00:02:08.069> had

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
is that he said these are the evens had

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.010 
is that he said these are the evens had
a<00:02:08.250> pilot<00:02:08.670> but<00:02:08.819> it<00:02:08.910> was<00:02:09.000> terrible<00:02:09.390> so<00:02:09.899> he

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
a pilot but it was terrible so he

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.750 
a pilot but it was terrible so he
decided<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.440> do<00:02:10.590> in<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.770> completely<00:02:11.250> different

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
decided to do in a completely different

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.070 
decided to do in a completely different
show<00:02:11.940> which<00:02:12.209> I<00:02:12.330> love<00:02:12.629> I<00:02:12.780> love

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
because that was the thing about the

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.030 
because that was the thing about the
optimum<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.210> office<00:02:15.570> eventually<00:02:16.020> became<00:02:16.320> its

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
optimum the office eventually became its

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.800 
optimum the office eventually became its
own<00:02:17.190> show<00:02:17.520> but<00:02:18.060> at<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.180> very<00:02:18.210> beginning<00:02:18.510> they

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
own show but at the very beginning they

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.240 
own show but at the very beginning they
just<00:02:18.990> said<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.320> in<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.680> same<00:02:19.830> with<00:02:20.010> with

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
just said and in the same with with

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.340 
just said and in the same with with
coupling<00:02:20.700> know<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.090> office<00:02:21.420> succeeded<00:02:21.900> the

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
coupling know the office succeeded the

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.990 
coupling know the office succeeded the
American<00:02:22.650> office<00:02:22.950> succeeded<00:02:23.460> and<00:02:23.550> survived

American office succeeded and survived

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.630 
American office succeeded and survived
and<00:02:24.300> became<00:02:24.930> its<00:02:25.050> own<00:02:25.170> thing<00:02:25.440> coupling<00:02:26.250> lasted

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
and became its own thing coupling lasted

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.550 
and became its own thing coupling lasted
like<00:02:26.730> an<00:02:26.880> episode<00:02:27.330> or<00:02:27.510> something<00:02:27.900> because

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
like an episode or something because

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.370 
like an episode or something because
what<00:02:28.830> they<00:02:28.950> do<00:02:29.010> is<00:02:29.130> it<00:02:29.400> just<00:02:29.610> take<00:02:29.970> the

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
what they do is it just take the

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.650 
what they do is it just take the
original<00:02:31.380> British<00:02:31.710> episode<00:02:32.100> and<00:02:32.280> then<00:02:32.340> try<00:02:32.580> to

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
original British episode and then try to

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.880 
original British episode and then try to
just<00:02:34.310> um<00:02:35.360> tweak<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.540> slightly<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.530> make<00:02:37.680> it

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
just um tweak the slightly to make it

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.830 
just um tweak the slightly to make it
work<00:02:38.070> for<00:02:38.100> an<00:02:38.340> American<00:02:38.640> audience<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:39.120> it

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
work for an American audience and it

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.960 
work for an American audience and it
just<00:02:40.080> doesn't<00:02:40.830> always<00:02:41.040> work<00:02:41.190> or<00:02:41.490> doesn't<00:02:41.730> work

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
just doesn't always work or doesn't work

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.630 
just doesn't always work or doesn't work
very<00:02:42.000> well<00:02:42.210> so<00:02:42.390> I'm<00:02:42.840> really<00:02:43.620> excited<00:02:43.800> to<00:02:44.340> hear

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
that he is doing a completely different
