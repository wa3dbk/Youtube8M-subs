 two 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:07.750
 two 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.750
 p 

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:14.949
 p 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:18.359
 two 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.419
 it touched him directly 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:23.809
 the computer in friends x I'm going to tell you how to form that gómez 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.399
 what do you have and windows in English 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:30.519
 what we have to act we put them the type of man and we think a lack of 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:33.250
 than your children because button to load it 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.310
 to the complex installation 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.020
 the trick is what will get us out 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.540
 remember that we are working with the windows the installed computation the 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.570
 windows xp the central comedy 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.310
 and I'm going here I'm going to give a record of 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.030
 windows xp professional 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.980
 I hope you answered me in the happy 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.980
 down has a subsidiary 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.140
 that such clients to continue 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.830
 it serves to repair 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.670
 free three partials 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.920
 the first clear option 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.850
 zertuche 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.630
 av whole 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.039
 to go to the installation of the clean spot in the chest 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:10.740
 at present 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.080
 so it is pointed 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.690
 most recent release 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.690
 simon kjaer this is the first option 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.610
 hopefully load the screens do not you think the windows contract where we 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.310
 explain what wiki wiki blablabla 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.930
 so good atmosphere 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.340
 here we are simply going to accept the contract that binds them 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.000
 the attacks and as getafe or facts 7 accept 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.300
 efe what is 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.970
 for the central 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.970
 and say yes to give 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.480
 but we are going to present 18 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.100
 accepting all the contract that we are marked as a species and in the sentence 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.290
 let's take advantage 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.110
 is loading the information 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.219
 remember that I am working with the computer that is installed 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:06.150
 the windows xp competition 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.309
 and I'm going to impress the public xp palm 

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:12.639
 cracked 

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:15.159
 but a matter of which there is a partition 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:18.760
 so what I'm going to do in stages and scientific so it seems to be 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.649
 a good option 

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:24.969
 delete the partition that higuaín 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:27.579
 looted as exposes several sessions 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:29.569
 enter to install 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.139
 d to erase the partition 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:33.739
 and it is that three phases 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.519
 what I'm going to do as a basement like we only love cortez 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.369
 energy here in this space 

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:43.249
 both decide here about 2 3 4 15 and 20 thousand 

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:46.409
 this act is that we are going to go one by one 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:50.709
 this by rambo partitions like this case I only have one part machine 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:51.599
 Computer 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.089
 possibly china workshop 

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:56.159
 the one that pressed efe 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:58.759
 and it seems to me that this one 

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:01.169
 yes I am sure that the sacyr table 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:04.169
 in any case to continue 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:05.829
 what is 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:06.979
 to cancel 

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:09.979
 As I'm sure I'm doing I'm going to give a more tint 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:16.419
 villa allende 

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:21.659
 the actress assures that it is to win it 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:24.619
 let's press the chili key 

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:29.269
 l to delete this game has been resolved the decision has why 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.769
 he returned to madrid 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.769
 let's be l for ropes 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.909
 or that orange clay here seems that there is no longer any partition 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:43.259
 yesterday that is now what we are going to do 

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:47.620
 give whole milk to go directly to the installation we give 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.620
 enter once for all the parts 

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:52.759
 mourners 

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:55.239
 She seems like I want clear way 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.049
 in on this lawn 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:58.200
 I think two 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.749
 carpentier fall fast 

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:01.819
 with the norm 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:05.079
 as he attacked engine that not many things this 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.349
 it is simply a version depend on delivered 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:10.449
 the scientist 

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:12.019
 I'm going to put that art 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:13.629
 the southern part use it 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:15.419
 np ss 

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:18.900
 instead quick that this color this keyboard we had 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.779
 current generation rivas 

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:25.180
 like that up there and there are no people 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.830
 remember that we feel safe or we get here we do not have why and we want 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:29.520
 go out 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.309
 If I call center let's continue 

00:04:32.309 --> 00:04:35.590
 what are we doing with the gates and how this point of being 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.590
 and formal type ecofin so I will not do 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.779
 a whole day simply 

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:45.830
 we wait for the formative system 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.129
 in front of an unconscious or 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:49.439
 that we do not wait for you 

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:52.439
 here 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:58.520
 or that once it's over 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.719
 It was fast 

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:02.289
 will start hosting all the files 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:05.289
 criticized that the archival auto the officer added 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:10.539
 so what did it do a lot for? 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:13.539
 ausol video and continued uribe droughts 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.270
 remember that he is a pilot because the poor the dt 

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:21.050
 as a set 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.089
 although it is 70 percent 

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:25.620
 well debut is baking 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.620
 according to the archives 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.770
 being elusive 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.770
 with a 74 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:42.800
 we wanted 100% of the installation 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.210
 here says it does not compute now it's going to restart 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:49.279
 in I write a 2 8% 

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:52.279
 we hope that happens and ended in September 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.650
 We believe that payment 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.650
 wait for it to restart 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:10.080
 that phrase we press any key to go to facilities 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.830
 We're not going to do that or we do not have any because everything 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.180
 the beginning when we put the disk installation of windows to be able 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.430
 know that this one 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.699
 because we cross ourselves 

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:21.439
 two more people 

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:23.580
 and we expect sacrifices that 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.330
 Here at meat we see that today we take into account the celebration of vision 

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:30.159
 or they tell me 

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:33.159
 windows xp professional 

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:42.529
 is that while it starts 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.400
 you go alicante on the screen 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.080
 specific 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.080
 good night v 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:56.460
 that is to be left then they fear that this time also of pec 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.680
 conformation a computer 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.860
 hours later 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.330
 good and also that she 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.409
 she started warming up the action 

00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:07.740
 already making collection already cost him about the information 

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.569
 culiacán 

00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:14.559
 dynamic apex dynamic updates 

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:18.269
 size prepared the installation and now we are installing in the trial 

00:07:19.349 --> 00:07:22.349
 there are those who say that the installation is to complete it 

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:26.139
 39 minutes 

00:07:26.819 --> 00:07:29.169
 not always what to fear 

00:07:29.169 --> 00:07:31.969
 how fast they are sick 

00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:33.360
