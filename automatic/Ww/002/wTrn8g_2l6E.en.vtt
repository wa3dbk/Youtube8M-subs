00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.989
 I roll up such 

00:00:53.749 --> 00:01:01.850

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.850
 I have three liters but there let 100 more 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.580

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.900
 liquids I put you in the pot on 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.410
 fire and boil 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:43.840
 and for every one and a half liters to me on in general 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:49.180
 no need for 3 liters 2 tablespoons 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:52.900
 total sony and 200 grams of sugar there I already 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:55.390
 put in the bank here we will now 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.369
 pour vinegar here if liter here 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.090
 can or even 800 grams 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:04.860
 I take a 9 percent full 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:08.050
 almost a spoonful of vinegar to 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.140
 leave so as not to confuse there 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:19.000
 and if the jar is small then 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:21.310
 half only spoon enough vinegar 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.110
 and so in every jar 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:31.860
 then pour our brine and roll up 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:38.500

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:47.340
