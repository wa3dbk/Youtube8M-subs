00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
expensive at the moment I believe he's

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.940 
expensive at the moment I believe he's
around<00:03:36.090> 350<00:03:36.780> k<00:03:36.989> at<00:03:37.169> the<00:03:37.230> time<00:03:37.440> recorded

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.500 
around 350 k at the time recorded
perhaps<00:03:38.489> not<00:03:38.669> so<00:03:38.819> at<00:03:38.940> the<00:03:39.000> time<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.299> video

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510

perhaps not so at the time the video
going<00:03:39.660> like<00:03:39.870> some<00:03:40.169> short<00:03:40.530> more<00:03:40.829> packs<00:03:41.099> would

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
going like some short more packs would

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.390 
going like some short more packs would
have<00:03:41.370> been<00:03:41.519> opened<00:03:42.030> but<00:03:42.769> 91<00:03:43.769> pace<00:03:43.980> air<00:03:44.250> to

but<00:04:21.630> I<00:04:21.660> feel<00:04:22.049> like<00:04:22.169> in<00:04:22.380> this<00:04:22.560> situation

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
but I feel like in this situation

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.709 
but I feel like in this situation
perhaps<00:04:23.280> benteke<00:04:23.909> might<00:04:24.240> have<00:04:24.360> been<00:04:24.450> the<00:04:24.479> more

00:04:24.709 --> 00:04:24.719 
perhaps benteke might have been the more

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:26.959 
perhaps benteke might have been the more
suited<00:04:25.140> one<00:04:25.349> Lukaku<00:04:26.130> for<00:04:26.280> me<00:04:26.340> just<00:04:26.580> wasn't

00:04:26.959 --> 00:04:26.969 
suited one Lukaku for me just wasn't

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:27.540 
suited one Lukaku for me just wasn't
getting<00:04:27.060> involved

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
getting involved

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.399 
getting involved
enough<00:04:27.759> maybe<00:04:28.000> even<00:04:28.300> another<00:04:28.479> Pacey<00:04:29.020> player

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:29.409 
enough maybe even another Pacey player

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:31.909 
enough maybe even another Pacey player
like<00:04:29.919> a<00:04:29.949> storage<00:04:30.490> or<00:04:30.669> something<00:04:30.970> because<00:04:31.150> I

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
like a storage or something because I

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.619 
like a storage or something because I
just<00:04:32.919> did<00:04:33.069> not<00:04:33.220> seem<00:04:33.520> like<00:04:33.970> your<00:04:34.150> car<00:04:34.360> key<00:04:34.509> was

00:04:34.619 --> 00:04:34.629 
just did not seem like your car key was

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:36.089 
just did not seem like your car key was
getting<00:04:34.870> enough<00:04:35.050> on<00:04:35.169> it<00:04:35.289> but<00:04:35.470> he<00:04:35.800> is<00:04:35.919> when<00:04:36.069> I

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:36.099 
getting enough on it but he is when I

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:37.680 
getting enough on it but he is when I
was<00:04:36.220> plays<00:04:36.400> that<00:04:36.610> when<00:04:36.879> you<00:04:37.210> use<00:04:37.240> them<00:04:37.539> in<00:04:37.599> the

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
was plays that when you use them in the

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.300 
was plays that when you use them in the
right<00:04:37.780> situation<00:04:38.349> if<00:04:38.500> you<00:04:38.650> can<00:04:38.770> get<00:04:38.919> across<00:04:39.069> on

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
right situation if you can get across on

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.860 
right situation if you can get across on
to<00:04:39.430> me<00:04:39.550> if<00:04:39.639> you<00:04:39.729> come<00:04:39.849> around<00:04:39.970> his<00:04:40.240> strength<00:04:40.479> he

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
to me if you come around his strength he

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.420 
to me if you come around his strength he
is<00:04:40.960> absolutely<00:04:41.259> fantastic<00:04:41.500> but<00:04:41.949> perhaps<00:04:42.099> I

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
is absolutely fantastic but perhaps I

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.279 
is absolutely fantastic but perhaps I
just<00:04:42.879> wasn't<00:04:43.030> doing<00:04:43.419> that<00:04:43.449> properly<00:04:43.990> but

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
just wasn't doing that properly but

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:45.869 
just wasn't doing that properly but
let's<00:04:44.979> first<00:04:45.159> hear<00:04:45.310> the<00:04:45.430> end<00:04:45.550> of<00:04:45.639> this<00:04:45.699> episode
