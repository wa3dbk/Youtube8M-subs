00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.509
 serious if you asked me 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:25.210

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:26.829

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:30.399
 or that it is from pinocho is mine but that is 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.670
 of whole wood in the middle of the field is 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:36.730
 super nice I love it either is 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.309
 carmelo hand although it emits super well in 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.219
 my tattoo in question is this beige is 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.809
 one and with nobody you say that by the way the 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:46.989
 tattoo I have to review it because 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:49.780
 I'm super smart you know and when I get 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.789
 I was healing, I did not know that 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.519
 He healed and I saw that I got a scab and 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:56.800
 I said I think it's rotting ready 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:59.260
 from me with all my intelligence I 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.809
 I started the postilla that had been the 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.909
 tattoo and he went all the ink with the 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.560
 Apostille because I am a super person 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:06.640
 ready and super cultivated like you 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.670
 you will know 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.250
 now the meaning juanma comes because 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.100
 It's statues a car with no one if I tell you 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.630
 story is worth it for video encounter 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.700
 so that you do not ask me anymore we are going to 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.880
 focus again on the tattoo with after 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.100
 of this one is made a texture I do not know what 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.280
 typography is one that is and wind there is 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.090
 wind to a stick 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.119
 well as you see is a u with eder is 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.770
 super normal and is and I wanted to tattoo 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.600
 something that had to do with strength and 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.509
 with will not with willpower 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.460
 not with force and with will a point in 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.250
 the two words have the one of brings 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:48.500
 one point is strength and another is will and 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:51.149
 in total English in total, not altogether 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.970
 encompasses the meaning of the song of 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.880
 'you and i' by lady gaga because to me that 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.399
 song fills me up when you're lidl 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.520
 manserja I really like that song end 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.619
 I'm not the monster of these but yes 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.539
 It strikes me, Lady Gaga, not me 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.720
 like to be classified within a genre 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:13.230
 you know I do not like that I respect the 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.350
 people that but not me and I 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.300
 I want to act out a mockingjay is whether or asia 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.590
 if you have read the trilogy of 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.420
 Hunger games or you know what they are 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.610
 the hunger games you will know what it is 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.130
 a good moussacre because I want to tattoo 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.459
 the mockingjay symbol here on the back 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.470
 because I like it or because some bad ones I love 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.200
 tatuar a phrase from the 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.950
 of the advantages of being an outcast that 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.560
 I also liked the movie a lot 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.560
 book I did not read it but the phrase I 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.330
 like how it is explained and how it is 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.510
 translated also into Spanish because 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.420
 you know that when you fold a movie to 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.040
 Spanish many many expressions are 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.470
 they lose good not because I like it 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.590
 I like it a lot and I was here 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.200
 I just recorded here as in the middle of 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.140
 field you know jagger good because that 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.080

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.880

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.180

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.680

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.959

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.150

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.810

 read I like it because I say I speak you know 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.260

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.630
 your head when you see so fast time and 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.130
 that you tell me that if you have something 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.110
 tattooed if you want to tattoo something a 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.300
 a lot of things I want to exploit the 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.310
 comments section 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.030
