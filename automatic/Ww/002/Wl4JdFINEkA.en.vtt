00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
blow but I think that these cards these

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.069 
blow but I think that these cards these
independents<00:02:34.880> ID<00:02:35.000> cards<00:02:35.329> really<00:02:35.660> do<00:02:35.840> support

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079 
independents ID cards really do support

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:39.520 
independents ID cards really do support
that<00:02:36.980> style<00:02:37.370> of<00:02:37.549> play<00:02:38.000> and<00:02:38.299> the<00:02:38.569> value<00:02:39.079> get<00:02:39.260> you

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
that style of play and the value get you

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.840 
that style of play and the value get you
get<00:02:39.650> out<00:02:39.859> of<00:02:40.010> them<00:02:40.130> is<00:02:40.280> pretty<00:02:40.700> incredible

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
get out of them is pretty incredible

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.020 
get out of them is pretty incredible
like<00:02:41.269> I<00:02:41.799> might<00:02:42.799> hesitate<00:02:43.099> to<00:02:43.610> take<00:02:43.730> a<00:02:43.790> foot

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.520 
like I might hesitate to take a foot
captain<00:02:44.420> and<00:02:44.690> an<00:02:45.440> Opie<00:02:45.709> event<00:02:45.950> like

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
captain and an Opie event like

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.640 
captain and an Opie event like
20<00:02:47.250> points<00:02:47.640> but<00:02:48.240> i<00:02:48.270> would<00:02:48.420> not<00:02:48.840> hesitate<00:02:49.260> to

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
20 points but i would not hesitate to

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.740 
20 points but i would not hesitate to
take<00:02:50.130> a<00:02:50.190> fleet<00:02:50.400> captain<00:02:50.819> 200<00:02:51.540> points

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
take a fleet captain 200 points

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.270 
take a fleet captain 200 points
absolutely<00:02:52.440> no<00:02:52.770> hesitation<00:02:52.920> whatsoever

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
absolutely no hesitation whatsoever

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.730 
absolutely no hesitation whatsoever
because<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:54.480> value<00:02:54.750> get<00:02:55.110> out<00:02:55.260> of<00:02:55.380> this<00:02:55.440> card

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
because the value get out of this card

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.840 
because the value get out of this card
at<00:02:55.920> that<00:02:56.190> point<00:02:56.520> level<00:02:56.700> is<00:02:57.590> astronomical<00:02:58.590> so<00:02:59.520> I

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
at that point level is astronomical so I

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.050 
at that point level is astronomical so I
think<00:03:00.600> that<00:03:01.260> when<00:03:01.470> it<00:03:01.620> comes<00:03:01.920> to<00:03:02.280> Romulans

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
think that when it comes to Romulans

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.760 
think that when it comes to Romulans
it'll<00:03:03.360> be<00:03:03.420> really<00:03:03.600> interesting<00:03:03.690> to<00:03:04.080> see<00:03:04.530> how

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
it'll be really interesting to see how

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.830 
it'll be really interesting to see how
they<00:03:05.010> use<00:03:05.250> this<00:03:05.370> card<00:03:05.730> I<00:03:05.910> think<00:03:06.480> that<00:03:06.630> putting

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
they use this card I think that putting

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.140 
they use this card I think that putting
two<00:03:07.020> not<00:03:07.200> sure<00:03:07.380> on<00:03:07.560> this<00:03:07.739> card<00:03:08.130> just<00:03:08.970> makes

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
two not sure on this card just makes

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.420 
two not sure on this card just makes
sense<00:03:09.510> because<00:03:10.200> you<00:03:10.590> can<00:03:10.739> just<00:03:10.770> keep<00:03:11.250> her

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
sense because you can just keep her

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.690 
sense because you can just keep her
moving<00:03:11.640> wherever<00:03:12.060> you<00:03:12.180> need<00:03:12.209> to<00:03:12.450> move<00:03:12.870> her

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
moving wherever you need to move her

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.860 
moving wherever you need to move her
since<00:03:14.700> she'll<00:03:14.910> be<00:03:15.030> moving<00:03:15.180> lasting<00:03:15.660> fleet

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
since she'll be moving lasting fleet

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.350 
since she'll be moving lasting fleet
anyways<00:03:16.140> to<00:03:16.380> get<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.100> benefit<00:03:17.670> of<00:03:17.819> her

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
anyways to get the benefit of her

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.150 
anyways to get the benefit of her
ability<00:03:19.050> and<00:03:19.400> and<00:03:20.400> I<00:03:20.640> just<00:03:20.940> I<00:03:21.090> think<00:03:21.420> that<00:03:22.160> for

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
ability and and I just I think that for

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.060 
ability and and I just I think that for
that<00:03:23.250> Opie<00:03:23.550> that<00:03:23.820> that's<00:03:24.090> just<00:03:24.239> a<00:03:24.390> smart<00:03:24.660> move

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
that Opie that that's just a smart move

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.250 
that Opie that that's just a smart move
but<00:03:26.070> I<00:03:26.100> also<00:03:26.250> think<00:03:26.670> that<00:03:27.150> when<00:03:28.050> you<00:03:28.140> play

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
but I also think that when you play

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.380 
but I also think that when you play
bigger<00:03:28.440> games<00:03:28.709> these<00:03:29.190> cards<00:03:29.459> are<00:03:29.610> really

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
bigger games these cards are really

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.210 
bigger games these cards are really
really<00:03:30.840> gonna<00:03:31.080> be<00:03:31.260> incredibly<00:03:31.680> useful<00:03:31.739> so

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
really gonna be incredibly useful so

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.400 
really gonna be incredibly useful so
that's<00:03:33.000> what<00:03:33.300> i<00:03:33.330> think<00:03:33.540> of<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:33.900> ramen<00:03:34.140> in<00:03:34.260> car

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
that's what i think of the ramen in car

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.280 
that's what i think of the ramen in car
care<00:03:34.860> are<00:03:34.950> the<00:03:35.040> fleet<00:03:35.220> card<00:03:35.819> rules<00:03:36.120> um<00:03:36.450> just
