00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.690
 Welcome to Metabolism TV your source of correct information on the metabolism 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:25.430
 and health, I'm Frank Suarez specialist in obesity and metabolism. 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:32.850
 Listen! Metiritas, metiras y mentirotas, let's talk today about deceptive labels and 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:40.050
 of the labels that give incorrect information or say, almost truth, ok. Look, many 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.080
 people want to lose weight because obesity has become an epidemic, other people 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.600
 They want to control their diabetes because diabetes is also an epidemic, diabetes and 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.199
 obesity are related, it is known that more than 90% of people with diabetes 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.891
 suffer from obesity therefore there is a direct relationship between obesity and diabetes, if 

00:01:00.891 --> 00:01:06.729
 you have treated 200 thousand diets, if you have lost weight and come back and bounce again, do not go 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:12.630
 of the vicious cycle of the diets, know that the solution is to know about the metabolism, 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.890
 Above all it is knowing, having knowledge, knowing what it is that you are ingesting, 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.579
 how are you ingesting it, what things affect the metabolism, what kind of water to use, 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:28.530
 which is information that we have in the book The Power of Metabolism, but let's 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.659
 speak specifically of the labels that are out there, notice, one of the bad 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.270
 understood that there is that people believe, for lack of information, that they should 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:45.170
 We are looking for foods that are low in calories, we have been counting calories for 40 years 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.289
 and it has been seen that counting calories definitely does not work because people are increasingly 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:54.929
 fatter wants that to say that does not work, even the calorie diets many times 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:00.350
 are diets of going hungry, when a person goes hungry the thyroid function is reduced, 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.900
 it is created as a hypothyroidism and then the person begins to gain weight wants to say 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.530
 It does not work to go hungry, if you want to lose weight and you want to lose weight permanently 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.820
 you have to improve the metabolism, the way to improve the metabolism is to work 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:20.010
 with the metabolism and not take for granted these lies that are on the labels I'm going to 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:27.069
 teach some for you to see, look, for example here has a food that basically 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:32.872
 they sell it as frozen food is called Lean Cuisine which is food to put the person 

00:02:32.872 --> 00:02:39.489
 thin but basically what is pasta, the pasta is from wheat is a starch, the starch 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.470
 it is converted into glucose and the glucose then becomes fat and that is the sequence, 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.620
 nobody, really will be able to lose weight with this, of course this is based on the theory 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.849
 that as he is low in fat because the person is going to lose weight, because that assumes that 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.349
 you eat a lot of fat that is what is going to get fat, let me tell you that if you 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:03.380
 put to eat fat, and fat nothing else you would be this skinny. Fat is not 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.990
 what fattens as explained in the book The Power of Metabolism, so that fat 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:12.360
 can fatten you have to exist in your body insulin, if there is no insulin the fat 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.420
 can not reach the cells, therefore you have to control what insulin produces 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.709
 And what does insulin produce? Carbohydrates, for example this food is high in carbohydrates, 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:28.549
 It's pasta. It produces a lot of insulin, it produces a lot of glucose and glucose and insulin goes 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.720
 to convert into fat. Now you will also see for example foods like these that use 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.290
 for diabetics, it's a pity that they are offering these for diabetics, because 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.371
 they sell this to the diabetic under the idea that it is low in the glycemic index, the 

00:03:43.371 --> 00:03:49.470
 glycemic index is, it is a measure of how fast or how slowly, a food goes up 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.530
 glucose in the blood, the reality is that this is a high-carbohydrate food, 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:01.250
 if you look at the carbohydrate content it is very high, a diabetic consumes this and 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.480
 definitely that your sugar will rise is not theoretical, it's not that Frank tells you 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.709
 Suarez If you are diabetic and eat 3 such cookies, take the measure of 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:16.000
 blood with your meter before eating it and an hour later take it again to 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.360
 that you see that it went up 50, 50 points with only 3 cookies of those, but on the other 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.040
 side we try to sell the idea of ​​calories that this brings nothing but 100 calories, 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.790
 the reality is that we've talked before and it's not going to work because it's a food, 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:36.080
 is a high carbohydrate food, when it is high in carbohydrates it will not allow 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.670
 slim down. There is also some deception with the theme of the portions, for example here 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:46.640
 you have a soup, a soup that is sold to you and it says here on the label that 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:53.480
 this is two parts, the reality is that everyone who does this eats the whole can, 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.050
 That is the truth and you know it. Does that mean that when you give that measure, you want 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.780
 that is to say that it is low in carbohydrate content, the reality is that if you 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:10.230
 will take two servings of this, we are eating a total of 56 grams of carbohydrates not 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.880
 There is a way that you can lose weight with that. Now the biggest lie of all 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.140
 what I've seen is this, this is incredible, this is incredible! This is truly 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:25.140
 for bobos, they sell us on television the idea and you have seen it, many of you 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:31.720
 have seen it, that one can lose weight eating corn chips, that is completely illogical, 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:38.170
 because how is it possible that someone can think that you can lose weight by giving your body 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:46.080
 corn, the same thing they use to fatten chickens and pigs, where does that fit? 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.220
 When you start using this, you can lose weight 2 weeks and what will go down 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:55.250
 It is pure water and will go down pure water because a certain hormonal imbalance is formed 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:01.000
 have so much cereal, so much glucose in the body, but you're going to see that there's no way you 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.530
 can lower permanently feeding your body with cereal, gentlemen, the cereal 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:12.650
 is what they use to feed the cattle, the pigs, the chickens, the cereal is starch, 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:17.710
 the starch by definition in the dictionary says it is simple sugar, you can not lose weight 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:23.940
 with that. How many of these firms know that we are looking for "how to lose weight" 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:29.750
 They sell us that idea, they give us a personality, someone famous on television, someone with 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:35.580
 authority that says that this thins, this does not lose weight. This what is going to lose weight 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:40.190
 It's the pocket, it's not going to lose weight otherwise. So look at the truth always triumphs.
