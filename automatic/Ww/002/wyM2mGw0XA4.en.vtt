00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.760 
or any sort of vessel that goes deep
underwater<00:01:44.880> what<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.420> do<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.899> when<00:01:46.619> you're

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
underwater what you do is when you're

descending with this you unscrew this
release<00:01:49.320> valve<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:49.979> actually

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
release valve and it actually

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.649 
release valve and it actually
pressurizes<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.880> case<00:01:51.179> as<00:01:51.390> you're<00:01:51.509> going

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659

down and as your ascending and the
reason<00:01:54.119> why<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.359> do<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:54.810> because<00:01:54.990> at<00:01:55.499> those

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
reason why I do that is because at those

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.200 
reason why I do that is because at those
depths<00:01:55.979> helium<00:01:56.579> is<00:01:56.700> actually<00:01:56.969> one<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.119> the

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
depths helium is actually one of the

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.940 
depths helium is actually one of the
smallest<00:01:57.509> molecules<00:01:58.140> will<00:01:58.409> actually<00:01:58.710> work

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
smallest molecules will actually work

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.289 
smallest molecules will actually work
its<00:01:59.189> way<00:01:59.399> into<00:01:59.729> the<00:02:00.299> case<00:02:01.259> seals<00:02:01.619> in<00:02:02.119> inside<00:02:03.119> of

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
its way into the case seals in inside of

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.940 
its way into the case seals in inside of
the<00:02:03.390> watch<00:02:03.569> so<00:02:03.869> if<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.140> came<00:02:04.350> back<00:02:04.530> up<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:04.890> you

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
the watch so if you came back up and you

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.340 
the watch so if you came back up and you
didn't<00:02:05.280> have<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.399> release<00:02:05.729> valve<00:02:05.929> the<00:02:06.929> crystal

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
didn't have a release valve the crystal

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.840 
didn't have a release valve the crystal
might<00:02:07.499> actually<00:02:07.679> pop<00:02:08.100> out<00:02:08.280> so<00:02:08.520> this<00:02:08.670> is<00:02:08.819> a

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
might actually pop out so this is a

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.249 
might actually pop out so this is a
pretty<00:02:09.179> serious<00:02:09.390> watch<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.020> comes<00:02:10.200> with

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
pretty serious watch that it comes with

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.860 
pretty serious watch that it comes with
that<00:02:10.470> it's<00:02:11.039> submersible<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.790> 500<00:02:12.270> meters<00:02:12.300> and

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
that it's submersible to 500 meters and

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.070 
that it's submersible to 500 meters and
it<00:02:13.500> has<00:02:13.620> this<00:02:13.770> huge<00:02:14.070> case<00:02:14.430> back<00:02:14.930> screw<00:02:15.930> down

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
it has this huge case back screw down

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.150 
it has this huge case back screw down

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.170 
day as a watch so really like that
another<00:02:31.680> really<00:02:31.950> cool<00:02:32.220> feature<00:02:32.280> on<00:02:32.730> this<00:02:32.880> is

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
the trade iam gas tubes so it uses

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.880 
the trade iam gas tubes so it uses
superglue<00:02:36.570> innova<00:02:36.990> on<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.350> hands<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:37.770> as

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
superglue innova on the hands and as

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.430 
superglue innova on the hands and as
well<00:02:38.070> as<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.390> seconds<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:39.630> on<00:02:39.960> the<00:02:40.050> top<00:02:40.260> on

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
well as the seconds and on the top on

trade<00:02:45.540> iam<00:02:45.690> gas<00:02:45.870> tubes<00:02:46.200> which<00:02:46.410> are<00:02:46.530> filled

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
trade iam gas tubes which are filled

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.960 
trade iam gas tubes which are filled
with<00:02:46.980> with<00:02:47.640> tritium<00:02:48.450> which<00:02:49.220> lasts<00:02:50.220> for<00:02:50.400> 25

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
with with tritium which lasts for 25

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.940 
with with tritium which lasts for 25
years<00:02:51.150> never<00:02:51.450> has<00:02:51.600> to<00:02:51.690> be<00:02:51.780> charged<00:02:52.200> and<00:02:52.410> it's

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
years never has to be charged and it's

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.250 
years never has to be charged and it's
actually<00:02:53.010> guaranteed<00:02:53.700> for<00:02:53.970> 10<00:02:54.180> years<00:02:54.420> so<00:02:54.690> it's

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
actually guaranteed for 10 years so it's

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.910 
actually guaranteed for 10 years so it's
in<00:02:55.560> blue<00:02:55.860> which<00:02:56.730> is<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:57.000> best<00:02:57.180> color<00:02:57.450> for

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
in blue which is the best color for

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.800 
in blue which is the best color for
diving<00:02:58.920> to<00:02:59.460> be<00:02:59.580> visible<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.270> under<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.600> water

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
diving to be visible and under the water

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.560 
diving to be visible and under the water
and<00:03:01.160> really<00:03:02.160> neat<00:03:02.340> so<00:03:02.610> you<00:03:02.970> can<00:03:03.150> be<00:03:03.300> you<00:03:03.510> know

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
and really neat so you can be you know

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.420 
and really neat so you can be you know
anywhere<00:03:03.990> anytime<00:03:04.290> this<00:03:04.710> thing<00:03:04.950> will<00:03:05.100> always

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
anywhere anytime this thing will always

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.280 
anywhere anytime this thing will always
glow<00:03:05.700> screw<00:03:06.660> down<00:03:06.780> crown<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.820> your<00:03:08.820> typical

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
glow screw down crown and your typical

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.540 
glow screw down crown and your typical
dive<00:03:10.290> strap<00:03:10.620> with<00:03:10.770> the<00:03:10.890> wrinkles<00:03:11.070> in<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.310> top

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
dive strap with the wrinkles in the top

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.250 
dive strap with the wrinkles in the top
it's<00:03:11.790> also<00:03:11.880> got<00:03:12.060> perforations<00:03:12.540> on<00:03:12.870> it<00:03:13.050> so<00:03:13.140> it

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
it's also got perforations on it so it

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.900 
it's also got perforations on it so it
dries<00:03:13.440> out<00:03:13.590> a<00:03:13.650> little<00:03:13.770> bit<00:03:13.920> quicker<00:03:14.160> a<00:03:14.430> couple

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
dries out a little bit quicker a couple

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.580 
dries out a little bit quicker a couple
centimeters<00:03:15.210> longer<00:03:15.660> than<00:03:15.930> a<00:03:15.990> typical<00:03:16.140> band

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
centimeters longer than a typical band

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.310 
centimeters longer than a typical band
so<00:03:17.040> you<00:03:17.130> can<00:03:17.250> get<00:03:17.370> it<00:03:17.430> over<00:03:17.640> a<00:03:18.030> wetsuit<00:03:18.540> put<00:03:19.260> it

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
so you can get it over a wetsuit put it

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.410 
so you can get it over a wetsuit put it
on<00:03:19.440> top<00:03:19.590> or<00:03:20.190> over<00:03:20.430> gloves<00:03:20.670> even<00:03:20.940> anything<00:03:21.209> like

on top or over gloves even anything like

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.530 
on top or over gloves even anything like
that<00:03:21.450> but<00:03:22.440> this<00:03:22.560> is<00:03:22.709> a<00:03:22.740> really<00:03:23.040> good-looking

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540
