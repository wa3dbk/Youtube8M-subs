for<00:03:17.019> the<00:03:17.080> Monster<00:03:17.470> Mash<00:03:17.680> and<00:03:17.980> uh<00:03:18.150> I<00:03:19.150> don't<00:03:19.810> get

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
for the Monster Mash and uh I don't get

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.290 
for the Monster Mash and uh I don't get
the<00:03:20.019> attack<00:03:20.260> race<00:03:20.470> which<00:03:20.709> sucks<00:03:21.010> but<00:03:21.310> I

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
the attack race which sucks but I

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.120 
the attack race which sucks but I
thought<00:03:22.900> he<00:03:23.019> might<00:03:23.140> switches<00:03:23.590> turn<00:03:23.769> not<00:03:23.950> whine

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
thought he might switches turn not whine

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.520 
thought he might switches turn not whine
to<00:03:24.280> lose<00:03:24.459> his<00:03:24.640> reunit<00:03:24.970> lists<00:03:25.239> but<00:03:26.080> instead<00:03:26.380> he

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
to lose his reunit lists but instead he

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.790 
to lose his reunit lists but instead he
just<00:03:26.560> goes<00:03:26.860> for<00:03:27.070> a<00:03:27.130> shadow<00:03:27.489> ball<00:03:27.760> and<00:03:27.970> I<00:03:28.620> go<00:03:29.620> for

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
goes for the animus Vox which if you get

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.070 
goes for the animus Vox which if you get
that<00:04:58.450> reference

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
that reference

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.320 
that reference
you're<00:04:59.590> either<00:04:59.740> a<00:04:59.890> glitch<00:05:00.220> mob<00:05:00.430> fan<00:05:00.670> like

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
you're either a glitch mob fan like

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.800 
you're either a glitch mob fan like
myself<00:05:01.450> or<00:05:01.900> you<00:05:02.110> take<00:05:03.630> Latin<00:05:04.630> or<00:05:05.410> something<00:05:05.890> I

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
myself or you take Latin or something I

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.060 
myself or you take Latin or something I
think<00:05:07.810> that<00:05:07.960> half<00:05:08.200> the<00:05:08.380> reason<00:05:08.560> I<00:05:08.770> made<00:05:08.950> this

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
think that half the reason I made this

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.590 
think that half the reason I made this
tech<00:05:09.310> stack<00:05:09.550> was<00:05:09.730> just<00:05:09.910> to<00:05:10.000> make<00:05:10.120> references

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
tech stack was just to make references

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.150 
tech stack was just to make references
that<00:05:10.720> I<00:05:10.810> liked<00:05:11.050> two<00:05:11.320> things<00:05:11.560> and<00:05:11.770> then<00:05:11.860> to<00:05:11.980> see

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
that I liked two things and then to see

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.170 
that I liked two things and then to see
if<00:05:12.250> other<00:05:12.370> people<00:05:12.700> got<00:05:12.850> it

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
if other people got it

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.970 
if other people got it
I<00:05:13.210> don't<00:05:13.570> know<00:05:13.630> that's<00:05:13.750> just<00:05:13.870> me<00:05:14.080> speaking<00:05:14.800> of

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 
I don't know that's just me speaking of

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.070 
I don't know that's just me speaking of

so<00:05:25.090> um<00:05:25.560> Draco<00:05:26.560> media<00:05:26.830> are<00:05:26.920> gonna<00:05:27.040> do<00:05:27.250> a<00:05:27.280> little

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
so um Draco media are gonna do a little

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.730 
so um Draco media are gonna do a little
under<00:05:27.760> half<00:05:27.910> and<00:05:28.270> by<00:05:29.050> that<00:05:29.230> logic<00:05:29.410> I<00:05:29.620> was

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
under half and by that logic I was

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.950 
under half and by that logic I was
thinking<00:05:30.010> well<00:05:30.190> I<00:05:30.400> can<00:05:30.700> sub<00:05:30.940> now<00:05:31.090> and<00:05:31.360> his<00:05:31.720> next

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
thinking well I can sub now and his next

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.270 
thinking well I can sub now and his next
one<00:05:32.140> will<00:05:32.260> probably<00:05:32.410> do<00:05:32.650> a<00:05:32.680> little<00:05:32.890> under<00:05:33.250> a

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
one will probably do a little under a

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.370 
one will probably do a little under a
quarter<00:05:33.730> or<00:05:34.300> a<00:05:34.360> kurta<00:05:34.990> so<00:05:35.680> um<00:05:36.450> yeah<00:05:37.450> but<00:05:37.810> maybe

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
quarter or a kurta so um yeah but maybe

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.960 
quarter or a kurta so um yeah but maybe
orangey<00:05:39.040> just<00:05:39.250> screwed<00:05:39.400> me<00:05:39.490> over<00:05:39.520> because<00:05:39.760> it

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
orangey just screwed me over because it
