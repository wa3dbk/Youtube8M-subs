just<00:01:48.550> absolutely<00:01:48.730> no<00:01:49.150> way<00:01:49.450> that<00:01:49.479> I<00:01:49.690> would<00:01:49.900> be

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
just absolutely no way that I would be

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.680 
just absolutely no way that I would be
able<00:01:50.110> to<00:01:50.290> spend<00:01:50.560> even<00:01:51.040> 75<00:01:51.790> dollars<00:01:52.180> a<00:01:52.210> week<00:01:52.479> on

getting my face microdermabrasion

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.240 
getting my face microdermabrasion
because<00:01:55.240> it<00:01:55.930> adds<00:01:56.110> up<00:01:56.350> really<00:01:56.530> fast<00:01:56.830> so<00:01:57.070> with

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
because it adds up really fast so with

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.640 
because it adds up really fast so with
this<00:01:57.460> kit<00:01:57.760> you<00:01:57.790> pay<00:01:58.120> a<00:01:58.330> one-time<00:01:58.630> fee<00:01:58.900> and<00:01:59.500> it's

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
this kit you pay a one-time fee and it's

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.469 
this kit you pay a one-time fee and it's
gonna<00:01:59.770> be<00:02:00.010> less<00:02:00.430> than<00:02:00.700> it<00:02:00.850> would<00:02:00.970> even<00:02:01.210> be<00:02:01.240> to

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
gonna be less than it would even be to

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.030 
gonna be less than it would even be to
get<00:02:01.630> one<00:02:01.930> microderm<00:02:02.500> treatment

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
get one microderm treatment

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.250 
get one microderm treatment
microdermabrasion<00:02:03.970> is<00:02:04.150> known<00:02:04.510> to<00:02:04.750> treat<00:02:04.960> fine

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
microdermabrasion is known to treat fine

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.170 
microdermabrasion is known to treat fine
lines<00:02:05.530> and<00:02:05.770> wrinkles<00:02:06.010> but<00:02:06.610> that's<00:02:06.790> honestly

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
lines and wrinkles but that's honestly

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.859 
lines and wrinkles but that's honestly
not<00:02:07.360> the<00:02:07.570> reason<00:02:07.870> that<00:02:07.990> I<00:02:08.049> use<00:02:08.200> it

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
not the reason that I use it

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.690 
not the reason that I use it
really<00:02:09.170> using<00:02:09.379> it<00:02:09.619> for<00:02:09.830> acne<00:02:10.280> scarring

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
really using it for acne scarring

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.509 
really using it for acne scarring
blotchy<00:02:11.510> skin<00:02:11.720> and<00:02:12.230> uneven<00:02:12.830> skin<00:02:12.980> tone<00:02:13.340> and

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
blotchy skin and uneven skin tone and

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.520 
blotchy skin and uneven skin tone and
basically<00:02:13.879> what<00:02:14.150> microdermabrasion<00:02:15.049> is<00:02:15.290> is

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
basically what microdermabrasion is is

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.309 
basically what microdermabrasion is is
it<00:02:15.920> just<00:02:15.950> sends<00:02:16.730> off<00:02:16.849> the<00:02:17.239> first<00:02:17.629> upper<00:02:18.110> layer

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
it just sends off the first upper layer

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.559 
it just sends off the first upper layer
of<00:02:18.349> your<00:02:18.739> skin<00:02:18.799> so<00:02:19.370> it<00:02:19.459> gets<00:02:19.670> rid<00:02:19.909> of<00:02:19.940> all<00:02:20.269> the

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
of your skin so it gets rid of all the

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.420 
of your skin so it gets rid of all the
dead<00:02:20.840> skin<00:02:21.019> cells<00:02:21.440> that<00:02:21.530> have<00:02:21.769> built<00:02:22.040> up<00:02:22.220> and

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
dead skin cells that have built up and

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.490 
dead skin cells that have built up and
that's<00:02:22.549> essentially<00:02:22.909> what<00:02:23.060> scarring<00:02:23.629> is<00:02:23.870> then

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
that's essentially what scarring is then

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.649 
that's essentially what scarring is then
the<00:02:24.680> body<00:02:24.860> naturally<00:02:25.239> replaces<00:02:26.239> the<00:02:26.360> skin

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:26.659 
the body naturally replaces the skin

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:28.839 
the body naturally replaces the skin
that<00:02:26.900> you<00:02:27.079> basically<00:02:27.620> send<00:02:27.950> it<00:02:28.099> off<00:02:28.340> with

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
that you basically send it off with

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.449 
that you basically send it off with
fresh<00:02:29.120> new<00:02:29.599> clear<00:02:29.989> skin<00:02:30.349> the<00:02:30.709> microderm<00:02:31.250> that

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
fresh new clear skin the microderm that

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.360 
fresh new clear skin the microderm that
I<00:02:31.489> use<00:02:31.879> also<00:02:32.360> has<00:02:32.569> vacuum<00:02:33.200> suction<00:02:33.860> so<00:02:34.280> it

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
I use also has vacuum suction so it

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.160 
I use also has vacuum suction so it
really<00:02:34.579> helps<00:02:34.940> to<00:02:35.120> get<00:02:35.269> the<00:02:35.329> oils<00:02:35.900> and<00:02:36.049> the

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
really helps to get the oils and the

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.229 
really helps to get the oils and the
dirt<00:02:36.440> out<00:02:36.620> of<00:02:36.650> your<00:02:36.739> pores<00:02:37.159> as<00:02:37.370> well<00:02:37.610> and<00:02:37.849> that

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
dirt out of your pores as well and that

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.119 
dirt out of your pores as well and that
can<00:02:38.390> really<00:02:38.599> help<00:02:38.870> minimize<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.470> size<00:02:39.920> of

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:40.129 
can really help minimize the size of

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:41.979 
can really help minimize the size of
your<00:02:40.250> pores<00:02:40.519> but<00:02:41.000> one<00:02:41.120> of<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.299> reasons<00:02:41.660> that<00:02:41.840> I

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
your pores but one of the reasons that I

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.650 
your pores but one of the reasons that I
really<00:02:42.109> really<00:02:43.010> love<00:02:43.480> microdermabrasion<00:02:44.480> is

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
and how fast it is so I'm gonna jump

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.250 
and how fast it is so I'm gonna jump
into<00:03:07.549> that<00:03:07.730> demo<00:03:08.000> right<00:03:08.269> now<00:03:08.299> so<00:03:08.870> for<00:03:09.200> the

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
into that demo right now so for the

into that demo right now so for the
filing<00:03:09.590> discs<00:03:10.010> themselves<00:03:10.220> you<00:03:10.670> can<00:03:10.790> pick

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
filing discs themselves you can pick

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.879 
filing discs themselves you can pick
from<00:03:11.060> two<00:03:11.599> different<00:03:11.989> sizes<00:03:12.200> and<00:03:12.590> two

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:12.889 
from two different sizes and two

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:14.890 
from two different sizes and two
different<00:03:13.040> colors<00:03:13.579> that<00:03:13.819> have<00:03:13.970> two<00:03:14.480> different

different colors that have two different

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.809 
different colors that have two different
levels<00:03:15.079> of<00:03:15.380> strength<00:03:15.769> so<00:03:15.980> the<00:03:16.099> smaller<00:03:16.430> ones

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
levels of strength so the smaller ones

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.190 
levels of strength so the smaller ones
are<00:03:16.970> gonna<00:03:17.090> be<00:03:17.299> for<00:03:17.540> those<00:03:17.660> hard-to-reach

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
are gonna be for those hard-to-reach

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.039 
are gonna be for those hard-to-reach
areas<00:03:18.919> and<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.819> bigger<00:03:20.030> files<00:03:20.359> are<00:03:20.720> for<00:03:20.959> the
