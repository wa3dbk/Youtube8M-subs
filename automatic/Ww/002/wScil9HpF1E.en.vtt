to<00:02:59.739> having<00:02:59.770> a<00:03:00.190> Linksys<00:03:00.580> router<00:03:00.850> for<00:03:01.380> your<00:03:02.380> Mac

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
to having a Linksys router for your Mac

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.250 
to having a Linksys router for your Mac
is<00:03:03.190> that<00:03:03.220> you<00:03:03.640> cannot<00:03:04.980> encrypt<00:03:05.980> it<00:03:06.190> so<00:03:07.080> it<00:03:08.080> will

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
is that you cannot encrypt it so it will

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.050 
is that you cannot encrypt it so it will
be<00:03:08.440> an<00:03:08.530> unsecured<00:03:09.220> Network<00:03:09.640> and<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:12.790> resolve

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
be an unsecured Network and to resolve

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.350 
be an unsecured Network and to resolve
this<00:03:13.390> is<00:03:13.660> I<00:03:13.840> got<00:03:14.050> this<00:03:14.260> for<00:03:14.760> xbox<00:03:15.760> live<00:03:16.030> in<00:03:16.209> my

this is I got this for xbox live in my
xbox<00:03:16.870> and<00:03:18.930> so<00:03:19.930> to<00:03:20.080> resolve<00:03:20.440> this<00:03:20.620> I<00:03:20.739> just<00:03:20.799> got<00:03:21.010> a

xbox and so to resolve this I just got a
rather<00:03:21.850> long<00:03:22.150> Ethernet<00:03:22.690> cable<00:03:23.019> which<00:03:23.200> is

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
rather long Ethernet cable which is

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.620 
rather long Ethernet cable which is
wired<00:03:23.830> around<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:24.459> walls<00:03:24.700> here<00:03:25.330> and<00:03:25.510> goes

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
wired around the walls here and goes

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
I clicked here where it says wireless

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.910 
I clicked here where it says wireless
network<00:03:42.730> mode<00:03:42.970> right<00:03:43.299> here<00:03:43.360> and<00:03:45.600> you'll<00:03:46.600> see

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
network mode right here and you'll see

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.850

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
tells you what kind of networks you will

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.500 
tells you what kind of networks you will

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.949 
allow to use this network and mix will
allow<00:04:01.959> both<00:04:02.230> be<00:04:03.060> self-explanatory<00:04:04.060> G<00:04:04.690> also

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
allow both be self-explanatory G also

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:06.870 
allow both be self-explanatory G also
suffix<00:04:05.530> planetory<00:04:05.920> and<00:04:06.549> there's<00:04:06.700> also

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
suffix planetory and there's also

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.170 
suffix planetory and there's also
disabled<00:04:07.810> which<00:04:08.470> will<00:04:08.680> not<00:04:08.830> allow<00:04:09.180> will

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
disabled which will not allow will

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.460 
disabled which will not allow will
disable<00:04:10.570> the<00:04:11.320> whole<00:04:11.530> wireless<00:04:12.160> network<00:04:12.670> and

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
disable the whole wireless network and

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.140 
disable the whole wireless network and
so<00:04:14.470> that's<00:04:14.680> what<00:04:14.829> I've<00:04:14.950> done<00:04:14.980> to<00:04:15.640> keep<00:04:15.670> people

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480 
about half an hour and it works like a

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.050 
about half an hour and it works like a
dream

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060

dream
now<00:04:51.530> first<00:04:52.530> certain<00:04:52.950> things<00:04:53.250> like<00:04:54.890> for<00:04:55.890> some

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
now first certain things like for some

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.550 
now first certain things like for some
routers<00:04:56.730> on<00:04:56.940> location<00:04:57.630> for<00:04:57.660> the<00:04:58.050> router<00:04:58.260> you

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
routers on location for the router you

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.140 
routers on location for the router you
will<00:04:58.710> not<00:04:58.860> need<00:04:59.130> to<00:04:59.190> change<00:04:59.430> the<00:05:01.790> the<00:05:02.790> network

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
will not need to change the the network

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.200 
will not need to change the the network
settings<00:05:03.660> because<00:05:04.140> it<00:05:04.470> might<00:05:04.650> be<00:05:04.830> that<00:05:05.100> no<00:05:06.090> one

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
settings because it might be that no one

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.380 
settings because it might be that no one
will<00:05:06.390> be<00:05:06.540> able<00:05:06.570> to<00:05:06.840> access<00:05:07.050> it<00:05:07.650> from<00:05:08.390> outside

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
will be able to access it from outside
