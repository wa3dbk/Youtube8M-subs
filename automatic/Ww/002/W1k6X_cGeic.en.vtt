tonight<00:00:04.710> to<00:00:04.859> talk<00:00:05.069> about<00:00:05.250> stringing<00:00:05.759> of

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
tonight to talk about stringing of

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.750 
tonight to talk about stringing of
crosses<00:00:06.569> from<00:00:06.810> top<00:00:07.109> to<00:00:07.140> bottom<00:00:07.410> okay<00:00:08.040> so<00:00:08.099> i<00:00:08.429> did

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
crosses from top to bottom okay so i did

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.450 
crosses from top to bottom okay so i did
a<00:00:08.790> video<00:00:09.059> earlier<00:00:09.510> this<00:00:09.960> week<00:00:10.260> about<00:00:10.590> some

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
a video earlier this week about some

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.169 
a video earlier this week about some
tips<00:00:11.759> on<00:00:12.590> faster<00:00:13.590> cross<00:00:13.860> reading<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:14.670> in<00:00:15.030> that

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
tips on faster cross reading and in that

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.990 
tips on faster cross reading and in that
video<00:00:15.420> i<00:00:15.870> mentioned<00:00:16.560> that<00:00:16.920> i<00:00:16.980> always<00:00:17.369> string

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
video i mentioned that i always string

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.590 
video i mentioned that i always string
Mike<00:00:18.210> Ross's<00:00:18.539> top<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.619> bottom<00:00:20.100> okay<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.359> got

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
Mike Ross's top to bottom okay and I got

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.480 
Mike Ross's top to bottom okay and I got
a<00:00:21.630> couple<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:22.170> questions<00:00:22.680> from<00:00:22.890> people<00:00:23.130> about

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
a couple of questions from people about

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.920 
a couple of questions from people about
why<00:00:24.269> do<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:24.480> always<00:00:24.600> do<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.320> in<00:00:25.590> fact<00:00:25.800> one<00:00:26.730> guy

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
why do I always do that in fact one guy

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.300 
why do I always do that in fact one guy
had<00:00:27.930> asked<00:00:28.289> me<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.439> question<00:00:28.590> on<00:00:28.890> youtube

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
had asked me a question on youtube

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.189 
had asked me a question on youtube
comment<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:30.090> I<00:00:30.150> told<00:00:30.390> him<00:00:30.539> last<00:00:30.960> night

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
comment and so I told him last night

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.139 
comment and so I told him last night
that<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.439> was<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.590> little<00:00:32.340> bit<00:00:32.489> too<00:00:32.669> complicated

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
that it was a little bit too complicated

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.780 
that it was a little bit too complicated
to<00:00:33.570> cover<00:00:33.899> in<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.260> comment<00:00:34.829> so<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.460> would<00:00:35.670> do

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
to cover in a comment so that I would do

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.910 
to cover in a comment so that I would do
a<00:00:35.820> video<00:00:36.239> about<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:37.020> okay<00:00:37.260> so<00:00:37.320> that's<00:00:37.620> what<00:00:37.800> I'm

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
a video about it okay so that's what I'm

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.580 
a video about it okay so that's what I'm
doing<00:00:37.950> here<00:00:38.399> tonight<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:39.059> talk<00:00:40.020> about<00:00:40.050> why<00:00:40.559> I

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
doing here tonight is talk about why I

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.860 
doing here tonight is talk about why I
always<00:00:40.920> string<00:00:41.370> my<00:00:41.489> crosses<00:00:42.059> from<00:00:42.540> top<00:00:42.840> to

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
always string my crosses from top to

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.889 
always string my crosses from top to
bottom<00:00:43.079> okay<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.059> the<00:00:45.059> reason<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.629> well<00:00:45.809> let

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
bottom okay and the reason is well let

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.680 
bottom okay and the reason is well let
me<00:00:45.989> let<00:00:46.110> me<00:00:46.200> first<00:00:46.410> say<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:46.770> am<00:00:47.100> NOT<00:00:47.690> any

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
me let me first say that I am NOT any

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.750 
me let me first say that I am NOT any
type<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:48.960> engineer<00:00:49.770> don't<00:00:50.129> have<00:00:50.280> any<00:00:50.460> sort<00:00:50.670> of

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
type of engineer don't have any sort of

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.020 
type of engineer don't have any sort of
structural<00:00:51.710> engineering<00:00:52.710> background<00:00:53.579> okay<00:00:54.000> i

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
structural engineering background okay i

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.330 
structural engineering background okay i
tend<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.480> base<00:00:54.690> my<00:00:54.719> decisions<00:00:55.500> more<00:00:55.770> on<00:00:56.010> just

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
tend to base my decisions more on just

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.970 
tend to base my decisions more on just
simple<00:00:57.239> logic<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.930> intuition<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.590> basically

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
simple logic and intuition and basically

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.549 
simple logic and intuition and basically
what<00:00:59.520> just<00:00:59.760> makes<00:00:59.969> sense<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.510> me<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:01.730> so

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
what just makes sense to me and so

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.460 
what just makes sense to me and so
stringing<00:01:04.559> crosses<00:01:05.189> top<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:06.119> bottom<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.810> kind

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
stringing crosses top to bottom is kind

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.130 
stringing crosses top to bottom is kind
of<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.710> good<00:01:08.250> practice<00:01:08.939> or<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.119> best<00:01:09.360> practice<00:01:09.960> in

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
of a good practice or a best practice in

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.380 
of a good practice or a best practice in
the<00:01:10.170> stringing<00:01:10.650> community<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.880> reason

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
the stringing community and the reason

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.420 
the stringing community and the reason
that<00:01:12.659> it's<00:01:13.290> been<00:01:13.409> explained<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.920> me<00:01:14.070> is

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
that it's been explained to me is

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.740 
that it's been explained to me is
because<00:01:15.020> when<00:01:16.490> if<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.549> string<00:01:18.000> your<00:01:18.030> crosses

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
because when if you string your crosses

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.859 
because when if you string your crosses
top<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.920> bottom<00:01:20.450> when<00:01:21.450> you're<00:01:21.600> getting<00:01:21.689> close

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
top to bottom when you're getting close

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.810 
top to bottom when you're getting close
to<00:01:22.110> finishing<00:01:22.590> off<00:01:22.860> your<00:01:23.040> crosses<00:01:23.520> you've<00:01:23.670> got

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
to finishing off your crosses you've got

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.010 
to finishing off your crosses you've got
all<00:01:23.909> your<00:01:24.000> main<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.390> done<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.720> most<00:01:24.900> your

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
all your main is done and most your

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.230 
all your main is done and most your
crosses<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.770> there's<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.130> lot<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.400> stress<00:01:27.000> and

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
crosses and there's a lot of stress and

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.929 
crosses and there's a lot of stress and
pressure<00:01:27.509> on<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.590> frame<00:01:28.890> from<00:01:29.490> all<00:01:29.700> the

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
pressure on the frame from all the

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.490 
pressure on the frame from all the
tension<00:01:30.390> that's<00:01:30.509> already<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:30.869> place<00:01:31.170> for<00:01:31.409> the

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
tension that's already in place for the

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.800 
tension that's already in place for the
strings<00:01:31.740> you've<00:01:31.890> already<00:01:32.159> done<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.810> it's

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
strings you've already done and it's

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.270 
strings you've already done and it's
putting<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.140> lot<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.380> pressure<00:01:34.740> down<00:01:35.040> here<00:01:35.189> on

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
putting a lot of pressure down here on

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.969 
putting a lot of pressure down here on
the<00:01:35.310> frame<00:01:35.670> but<00:01:36.509> because<00:01:37.290> it's<00:01:37.500> down<00:01:37.680> here<00:01:37.920> at

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
the frame but because it's down here at

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.100 
the frame but because it's down here at
the<00:01:38.040> throat<00:01:38.490> area<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.090> frame<00:01:39.360> you've<00:01:39.900> got

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
the throat area of the frame you've got

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.499 
the throat area of the frame you've got
a<00:01:40.140> lot<00:01:40.409> more<00:01:40.439> support<00:01:41.250> okay<00:01:41.610> you've<00:01:42.180> got<00:01:42.360> the

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
a lot more support okay you've got the

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.660 
a lot more support okay you've got the
whole<00:01:42.630> throat<00:01:43.020> area<00:01:43.259> kind<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.009> supporting

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
whole throat area kind of supporting

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.630 
whole throat area kind of supporting
this<00:01:44.850> hoop<00:01:45.210> so<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:46.590> know<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.920> pressure<00:01:47.189> and

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
this hoop so you know the pressure and

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.219 
this hoop so you know the pressure and
stress<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.329> tension<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.689> is<00:01:48.810> putting<00:01:49.110> on

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
stress and tension that is putting on

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.929 
stress and tension that is putting on
there<00:01:49.500> it's<00:01:49.710> being<00:01:50.009> supported<00:01:50.549> by<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.729> other

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
there it's being supported by the other

the mains end at the throat I never do
bottom<00:03:46.380> to<00:03:46.500> top<00:03:46.650> crosses<00:03:47.220> I<00:03:47.370> always<00:03:47.940> do<00:03:48.150> top<00:03:48.480> to

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
bottom to top crosses I always do top to

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.200 
bottom to top crosses I always do top to
bottom<00:03:49.080> okay<00:03:49.410> and<00:03:49.650> so<00:03:50.070> really<00:03:50.580> when<00:03:51.000> you're

bottom okay and so really when you're
when<00:03:51.420> you're<00:03:51.570> dealing<00:03:51.810> with<00:03:52.110> different

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
when you're dealing with different

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.590 
when you're dealing with different
different<00:03:52.980> frame<00:03:53.250> patterns<00:03:53.670> I<00:03:53.880> mean<00:03:54.060> you<00:03:54.390> kind

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
different frame patterns I mean you kind

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.540 
different frame patterns I mean you kind
of<00:03:54.660> have<00:03:54.810> three<00:03:55.110> options<00:03:55.290> okay<00:03:55.800> you<00:03:56.280> can<00:03:56.430> do<00:03:56.520> a

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
of have three options okay you can do a

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.490 
of have three options okay you can do a
one<00:03:56.850> piece<00:03:57.090> traditional<00:03:57.750> pattern<00:03:58.110> that's

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
one piece traditional pattern that's

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.410 
one piece traditional pattern that's
what<00:03:58.710> I<00:03:58.740> actually<00:03:58.920> use<00:03:59.280> on<00:03:59.460> this<00:03:59.670> racket<00:04:00.150> okay

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
what I actually use on this racket okay

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.140 
what I actually use on this racket okay
so<00:04:00.840> I<00:04:00.870> strength<00:04:01.380> half<00:04:01.770> the<00:04:02.010> mains<00:04:02.250> and<00:04:02.610> tie

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
so I strength half the mains and tie

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.090 
so I strength half the mains and tie
them<00:04:03.270> off<00:04:03.450> and<00:04:03.750> then<00:04:04.380> the<00:04:04.500> other<00:04:04.680> half<00:04:04.920> the

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
them off and then the other half the

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.490 
them off and then the other half the
mains<00:04:05.370> with<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.090> long<00:04:06.360> side<00:04:06.720> basically<00:04:07.260> I<00:04:07.380> do

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
mains with the long side basically I do

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.410 
mains with the long side basically I do
half<00:04:07.830> the<00:04:07.860> mains<00:04:08.280> and<00:04:08.580> then<00:04:09.000> I<00:04:09.090> do<00:04:09.150> all<00:04:09.390> my

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
half the mains and then I do all my

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.990 
half the mains and then I do all my
crosses<00:04:10.020> but<00:04:10.560> risen<00:04:11.160> this<00:04:11.280> is<00:04:11.400> kind<00:04:11.640> of<00:04:11.700> just<00:04:11.730> a

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
crosses but risen this is kind of just a

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.690 
crosses but risen this is kind of just a
one<00:04:12.209> piece<00:04:12.390> traditional<00:04:13.080> pattern<00:04:13.530> is<00:04:13.709> because

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
one piece traditional pattern is because

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.360 
one piece traditional pattern is because
the<00:04:15.330> mains<00:04:15.630> on<00:04:15.959> this<00:04:16.140> racket<00:04:16.590> end<00:04:16.799> at<00:04:17.070> the<00:04:17.100> end

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
the mains on this racket end at the end

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.090 
the mains on this racket end at the end
at<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:17.640> top<00:04:17.910> so<00:04:18.810> I'm<00:04:19.109> already<00:04:19.410> up<00:04:19.620> here<00:04:19.650> so<00:04:20.040> I

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
at the top so I'm already up here so I

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.259 
at the top so I'm already up here so I
time<00:04:20.370> one<00:04:20.609> off<00:04:20.729> the<00:04:20.940> top

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
time one off the top

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:22.969 
time one off the top
on<00:04:21.329> my<00:04:21.479> short<00:04:21.720> side<00:04:21.959> and<00:04:22.259> then<00:04:22.560> on<00:04:22.620> my<00:04:22.740> long

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
on my short side and then on my long

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.499 
on my short side and then on my long
side<00:04:23.250> my<00:04:23.490> string<00:04:23.789> i'm<00:04:23.940> already<00:04:24.150> up<00:04:24.240> here<00:04:24.330> at

00:04:24.499 --> 00:04:24.509 
side my string i'm already up here at

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:26.480 
side my string i'm already up here at
the<00:04:24.569> top<00:04:24.629> so<00:04:25.199> i<00:04:25.259> just<00:04:25.470> start<00:04:25.710> my<00:04:25.830> crosses<00:04:26.280> and

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
the top so i just start my crosses and

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.700 
the top so i just start my crosses and
work<00:04:26.639> down<00:04:26.849> really<00:04:27.389> simple<00:04:27.960> nothing<00:04:28.289> to<00:04:28.530> worry

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
work down really simple nothing to worry

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.159 
work down really simple nothing to worry
about<00:04:28.770> but<00:04:29.550> then<00:04:29.909> when<00:04:30.330> you've<00:04:30.479> got<00:04:30.659> a<00:04:30.720> pattern

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
about but then when you've got a pattern

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.469 
about but then when you've got a pattern
where<00:04:31.319> the<00:04:31.440> means<00:04:31.680> end<00:04:32.009> of<00:04:32.190> the<00:04:32.310> throat<00:04:32.669> then

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
where the means end of the throat then

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.899 
where the means end of the throat then
you've<00:04:33.690> got<00:04:33.900> to<00:04:33.930> decide<00:04:34.199> if<00:04:34.800> you<00:04:34.949> assuming<00:04:35.759> you

00:04:35.899 --> 00:04:35.909 
you've got to decide if you assuming you

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:38.450 
you've got to decide if you assuming you
don't<00:04:36.090> want<00:04:36.419> to<00:04:36.509> do<00:04:36.659> bottom<00:04:37.560> to<00:04:37.770> top<00:04:37.949> crosses

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
don't want to do bottom to top crosses

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.369 
don't want to do bottom to top crosses
which<00:04:38.610> i<00:04:38.729> never<00:04:38.789> do<00:04:39.300> then<00:04:39.810> you've<00:04:39.990> got<00:04:40.169> two

00:04:40.369 --> 00:04:40.379 
which i never do then you've got two

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:42.680 
which i never do then you've got two
options<00:04:40.409> of<00:04:41.099> what<00:04:41.280> you<00:04:41.460> can<00:04:41.610> do<00:04:41.789> you<00:04:42.000> can<00:04:42.300> first

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
options of what you can do you can first

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.960 
options of what you can do you can first
you<00:04:42.840> can<00:04:42.960> do<00:04:43.050> a<00:04:43.080> two-piece<00:04:43.590> pattern<00:04:44.039> so<00:04:44.580> again

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
you can do a two-piece pattern so again

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.240 
you can do a two-piece pattern so again
you<00:04:45.509> have<00:04:45.599> two<00:04:45.810> pieces<00:04:46.020> of<00:04:46.199> string<00:04:46.409> you<00:04:46.860> do<00:04:47.009> all

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
you have two pieces of string you do all

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.040 
you have two pieces of string you do all
your<00:04:47.400> mains<00:04:47.639> with<00:04:47.970> one<00:04:48.180> piece<00:04:48.419> and<00:04:48.720> tie<00:04:48.990> them

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
your mains with one piece and tie them

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.290 
your mains with one piece and tie them
off<00:04:49.289> and<00:04:49.590> you<00:04:50.099> start<00:04:50.129> your<00:04:50.520> crosses<00:04:51.030> with<00:04:51.210> the

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
off and you start your crosses with the

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.330 
off and you start your crosses with the
second<00:04:51.659> piece<00:04:51.780> of<00:04:51.930> string<00:04:52.139> at<00:04:52.289> the<00:04:52.379> top<00:04:52.590> string

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
second piece of string at the top string

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.850 
second piece of string at the top string
them<00:04:53.490> top<00:04:53.759> down<00:04:54.060> and<00:04:54.419> then<00:04:54.900> tie<00:04:55.080> off<00:04:55.259> your<00:04:55.289> your

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
them top down and then tie off your your

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.469 
them top down and then tie off your your
buff<00:04:56.039> your<00:04:56.250> end<00:04:56.490> of<00:04:56.669> your<00:04:56.789> crosses<00:04:57.180> down<00:04:57.330> here

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
buff your end of your crosses down here

00:04:57.479 --> 00:04:59.270 
buff your end of your crosses down here
at<00:04:57.569> the<00:04:57.599> bottom<00:04:57.659> okay<00:04:58.560> so<00:04:58.620> that's<00:04:58.860> one<00:04:59.130> option

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
at the bottom okay so that's one option

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.640 
at the bottom okay so that's one option
is<00:04:59.520> to<00:04:59.669> do<00:04:59.759> it<00:04:59.849> to<00:05:00.030> peace<00:05:00.270> another<00:05:00.960> option<00:05:01.289> is

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
is to do it to peace another option is

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.170 
is to do it to peace another option is
to<00:05:01.830> do<00:05:01.979> what's<00:05:02.190> called<00:05:02.370> and<00:05:02.669> around<00:05:03.000> the<00:05:03.150> world

to do what's called and around the world

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.610 
to do what's called and around the world
pattern<00:05:03.870> or<00:05:04.020> a<00:05:04.050> lot<00:05:04.199> of<00:05:04.289> times<00:05:04.440> you'll<00:05:04.590> see

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
pattern or a lot of times you'll see

with<00:05:13.440> an<00:05:13.620> around-the-world<00:05:14.009> pattern<00:05:14.460> but

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
with an around-the-world pattern but

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.369 
with an around-the-world pattern but
basically<00:05:15.509> the<00:05:15.719> whole<00:05:15.810> premise<00:05:16.169> of<00:05:16.500> it<00:05:16.740> is<00:05:17.159> to

00:05:18.369 --> 00:05:18.379 
basically the whole premise of it is to

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:21.290 
basically the whole premise of it is to
use<00:05:19.379> string<00:05:19.800> string<00:05:20.190> your<00:05:20.370> mains<00:05:20.639> and<00:05:21.090> then

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
use string string your mains and then

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.149 
use string string your mains and then
you<00:05:21.509> make<00:05:21.750> sure<00:05:22.050> that<00:05:22.319> your<00:05:22.500> mains<00:05:22.710> are<00:05:22.889> at<00:05:23.039> the

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:23.159 
you make sure that your mains are at the

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:25.459 
you make sure that your mains are at the
top<00:05:23.400> so<00:05:23.849> maybe<00:05:24.060> like<00:05:24.569> in<00:05:24.750> one<00:05:24.930> pattern<00:05:25.169> that<00:05:25.349> i

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:25.469 
top so maybe like in one pattern that i

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:27.439 
top so maybe like in one pattern that i
use<00:05:25.740> called<00:05:26.130> the<00:05:26.219> dire<00:05:26.460> desire<00:05:26.909> around<00:05:27.330> the

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:27.449 
use called the dire desire around the

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:30.529 
use called the dire desire around the
world<00:05:27.630> pattern<00:05:27.990> I<00:05:28.139> string<00:05:29.130> all<00:05:29.250> my<00:05:29.400> mains<00:05:29.669> but

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539 
world pattern I string all my mains but

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:33.550 
world pattern I string all my mains but
I<00:05:30.569> leave<00:05:30.900> off<00:05:31.139> the<00:05:31.169> last<00:05:31.710> mean<00:05:32.130> on<00:05:32.460> each<00:05:32.729> side

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
I leave off the last mean on each side

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.080 
I leave off the last mean on each side
so<00:05:34.560> that<00:05:34.740> moves<00:05:35.039> that<00:05:35.400> since<00:05:35.610> I've<00:05:35.699> left<00:05:35.909> off

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
so that moves that since I've left off

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:37.490 
so that moves that since I've left off
the<00:05:36.120> last<00:05:36.330> main<00:05:36.630> that<00:05:36.900> means<00:05:37.110> that<00:05:37.259> I'm<00:05:37.349> up

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
the last main that means that I'm up

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.469 
the last main that means that I'm up
here<00:05:37.620> at<00:05:37.740> the<00:05:37.800> top<00:05:37.860> with<00:05:38.219> my<00:05:38.370> string<00:05:38.699> so<00:05:39.180> I<00:05:39.240> can

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
here at the top with my string so I can

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:41.089 
here at the top with my string so I can
do<00:05:39.569> a<00:05:39.599> cross<00:05:39.900> with<00:05:40.110> one<00:05:40.319> tie<00:05:40.560> it<00:05:40.620> off<00:05:40.830> and<00:05:41.069> then

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:41.099 
do a cross with one tie it off and then

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:43.339 
do a cross with one tie it off and then
I've<00:05:41.520> got<00:05:41.550> the<00:05:41.819> other<00:05:42.090> other<00:05:42.419> pieces<00:05:42.750> of<00:05:43.020> the

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:43.349 
I've got the other other pieces of the

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:46.550 
I've got the other other pieces of the
main<00:05:43.529> here<00:05:43.770> to<00:05:43.919> do<00:05:44.039> my<00:05:44.159> crosses<00:05:44.900> top<00:05:45.900> to<00:05:46.139> bottom

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
main here to do my crosses top to bottom

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.459 
main here to do my crosses top to bottom
and<00:05:46.680> then<00:05:47.430> basically<00:05:47.930> then<00:05:48.930> you're<00:05:49.139> kind<00:05:49.380> of

00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:49.469 
and then basically then you're kind of

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:51.050 
and then basically then you're kind of
left<00:05:49.680> with<00:05:49.889> those<00:05:50.009> last<00:05:50.250> two<00:05:50.460> mins<00:05:50.729> that<00:05:50.909> you

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
left with those last two mins that you

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.480 
left with those last two mins that you
got<00:05:51.210> to<00:05:51.360> finish<00:05:51.539> so<00:05:52.110> basically<00:05:52.620> that's<00:05:52.800> where

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
got to finish so basically that's where

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.459 
got to finish so basically that's where
the<00:05:53.610> name<00:05:53.849> of<00:05:53.909> the<00:05:54.180> pattern<00:05:54.509> comes<00:05:54.750> in<00:05:55.020> so<00:05:55.259> I

00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:55.469 
the name of the pattern comes in so I

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:57.559 
the name of the pattern comes in so I
kind<00:05:55.919> of<00:05:55.979> do<00:05:56.130> my<00:05:56.279> last<00:05:56.520> cross<00:05:56.819> and<00:05:57.150> then

00:05:57.559 --> 00:05:57.569 
kind of do my last cross and then

00:05:57.569 --> 00:05:59.360 
kind of do my last cross and then
basically<00:05:57.779> I<00:05:58.080> have<00:05:58.289> to<00:05:58.440> go<00:05:58.560> around<00:05:58.800> the<00:05:59.340> world

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
basically I have to go around the world

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.330 
basically I have to go around the world
so<00:06:00.150> I<00:06:00.180> have<00:06:00.360> to<00:06:00.509> string<00:06:00.840> the<00:06:00.960> last<00:06:01.199> main<00:06:01.469> string

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
so I have to string the last main string

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.550 
so I have to string the last main string
or<00:06:02.460> cross<00:06:02.669> up<00:06:02.969> here<00:06:03.419> and<00:06:03.539> string<00:06:04.020> the<00:06:04.139> last<00:06:04.349> me

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
or cross up here and string the last me

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.620 
or cross up here and string the last me
on<00:06:04.800> this<00:06:05.069> side<00:06:05.340> okay<00:06:05.520> so<00:06:05.729> I'm<00:06:06.210> not<00:06:06.419> going<00:06:06.569> to

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630 
on this side okay so I'm not going to

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.689 
on this side okay so I'm not going to
get<00:06:06.750> into<00:06:06.900> an<00:06:07.050> around-the-world<00:06:07.380> pattern<00:06:07.919> all

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:08.699 
get into an around-the-world pattern all

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:12.019 
get into an around-the-world pattern all
the<00:06:08.909> little<00:06:10.069> intricacies<00:06:11.069> of<00:06:11.279> it<00:06:11.669> in<00:06:11.880> this

00:06:12.019 --> 00:06:12.029 
the little intricacies of it in this

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:16.670 
the little intricacies of it in this
video<00:06:13.789> on<00:06:14.789> my<00:06:15.060> I<00:06:15.090> learned<00:06:15.719> to<00:06:15.900> string<00:06:16.169> DVD

00:06:46.429 --> 00:06:46.439 
reason why first of all why I do top to

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:49.639 
reason why first of all why I do top to
bottom<00:06:46.619> cross<00:06:47.159> as<00:06:47.399> always<00:06:47.789> and<00:06:48.029> then<00:06:48.719> kind<00:06:49.559> of

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:49.649 
bottom cross as always and then kind of

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:52.309 
bottom cross as always and then kind of
give<00:06:49.800> you<00:06:49.919> a<00:06:49.979> couple<00:06:50.159> of<00:06:50.399> ways<00:06:51.330> of<00:06:51.659> how<00:06:51.929> you<00:06:51.989> can

00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:52.319 
give you a couple of ways of how you can

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:54.320 
give you a couple of ways of how you can
do<00:06:52.469> that<00:06:52.619> by<00:06:52.679> two<00:06:52.919> piece<00:06:53.309> pattern<00:06:53.669> around<00:06:54.179> the

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:54.330 
do that by two piece pattern around the

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.559 
do that by two piece pattern around the
world<00:06:54.539> pattern<00:06:54.929> so<00:06:55.259> gang<00:06:55.919> I<00:06:56.099> hope<00:06:56.339> that<00:06:56.610> does

00:06:57.559 --> 00:06:57.569 
world pattern so gang I hope that does

00:06:57.569 --> 00:06:59.239 
world pattern so gang I hope that does
does<00:06:57.929> it<00:06:58.050> justice<00:06:58.439> and<00:06:58.679> answers<00:06:58.979> a<00:06:59.009> question

00:06:59.239 --> 00:06:59.249 
does it justice and answers a question
