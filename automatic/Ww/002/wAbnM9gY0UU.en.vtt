much
mainly<00:00:33.960> because<00:00:34.140> um<00:00:35.239> if<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:36.630> was<00:00:36.719> any<00:00:36.870> bigger<00:00:37.079> I

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
mainly because um if it was any bigger I

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.229

wouldn't<00:00:37.620> have<00:00:37.770> had<00:00:38.219> room<00:00:38.460> for<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:38.760> I'd

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
wouldn't have had room for it and I'd

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.450 
wouldn't have had room for it and I'd
have<00:00:39.420> missed<00:00:39.570> out<00:00:39.809> on<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.370> really<00:00:41.370> really

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
have missed out on it I really really

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.000

like<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.790> vehicle<00:00:42.149> itself<00:00:42.739> packed<00:00:43.739> with

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
like the vehicle itself packed with

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.000 
like the vehicle itself packed with
features<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.960> I<00:00:45.960> haven't<00:00:46.230> actually<00:00:46.379> got<00:00:46.680> them

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
features and I haven't actually got them

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.540 
features and I haven't actually got them
to<00:00:47.190> hand<00:00:47.489> but<00:00:48.210> there<00:00:49.020> are<00:00:49.260> firing<00:00:49.770> missiles<00:00:50.129> in

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
to hand but there are firing missiles in

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.500 
to hand but there are firing missiles in
these<00:00:51.030> holes<00:00:51.920> inside<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.100> wings<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.510> also

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
these holes inside of the wings and also

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.110 
these holes inside of the wings and also
when<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.530> open<00:00:55.980> up<00:00:56.210> this<00:00:57.210> front<00:00:57.449> bit<00:00:59.120> there

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
when you open up this front bit there

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.240 
when you open up this front bit there
are<00:01:01.879> then<00:01:02.879> fire<00:01:03.239> missiles<00:01:03.690> in<00:01:04.680> there<00:01:04.979> as<00:01:05.100> well

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
are then fire missiles in there as well

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.609 
are then fire missiles in there as well

and if I remember rightly to press these
buttons<00:01:07.680> on<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.369> side<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:09.090> they<00:01:09.750> fire<00:01:10.020> out<00:01:10.200> so

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.050 

I've<00:01:16.950> just<00:01:17.189> lost<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.880> mm-hmm

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
I've just lost that mm-hmm

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
I've just lost that mm-hmm
-<00:01:21.650> there<00:01:22.650> as<00:01:22.979> you'll<00:01:23.189> notice<00:01:23.490> oh<00:01:24.000> this<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.780> what

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
- there as you'll notice oh this is what

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.990 
- there as you'll notice oh this is what
I<00:01:25.110> lots<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.530> compare<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:27.350> when<00:01:28.520> the<00:01:29.520> stencil

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
I lots to compare it to when the stencil

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.140 
I lots to compare it to when the stencil
triggers<00:01:30.360> like<00:01:30.570> this<00:01:31.040> it<00:01:32.040> kinda<00:01:32.610> reminds<00:01:33.090> me

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
triggers like this it kinda reminds me

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.499 
triggers like this it kinda reminds me
of<00:01:34.130> the<00:01:35.130> Jedi<00:01:35.579> Starfire<00:01:37.759> see<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.880> comparison

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
of the Jedi Starfire see the comparison

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.630 
of the Jedi Starfire see the comparison
tsunami<00:01:40.520> kind<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.640> like<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:42.180> similar<00:01:43.399> style<00:01:44.399> to

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
tsunami kind of like a similar style to

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.580 
tsunami kind of like a similar style to
that

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
that

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.570 
that
I<00:01:46.619> think<00:01:47.610> that's<00:01:47.760> really<00:01:48.000> quite<00:01:48.450> good<00:01:49.490> it's<00:01:50.490> a

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
I think that's really quite good it's a

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.719 
I think that's really quite good it's a
nice<00:01:50.760> little<00:01:50.940> feature<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:52.159> I<00:01:53.159> will<00:01:53.369> do<00:01:53.580> the

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
nice little feature and I will do the

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.180 
nice little feature and I will do the
Jedi<00:01:53.940> Starfighter<00:01:54.240> pretty<00:01:54.750> soon<00:01:54.979> yeah<00:01:55.979> that's

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
Jedi Starfighter pretty soon yeah that's

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.590 
Jedi Starfighter pretty soon yeah that's
the<00:01:56.340> one<00:01:56.460> with<00:01:56.580> the<00:01:56.610> hyperspace<00:01:57.180> ring<00:01:57.420> and

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
the one with the hyperspace ring and

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.780 
the one with the hyperspace ring and
also<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.869> big<00:02:01.440> button<00:02:01.650> on<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.890> bottom<00:02:02.040> just

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
also a big button on the bottom just

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.870 
also a big button on the bottom just
there<00:02:02.970> paint<00:02:03.390> with<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.110> you've<00:02:04.350> got<00:02:04.880> the

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
there paint with that and you've got the

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.510 
there paint with that and you've got the
string<00:02:06.149> out<00:02:06.270> rings<00:02:09.679> how<00:02:10.679> much<00:02:10.860> her<00:02:11.130> in<00:02:11.340> its

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
string out rings how much her in its

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.150 
string out rings how much her in its
flight<00:02:12.150> mode<00:02:12.510> by<00:02:12.870> that<00:02:13.140> I<00:02:13.410> think<00:02:13.650> he<00:02:13.920> looks<00:02:14.100> a

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
flight mode by that I think he looks a

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.449 
flight mode by that I think he looks a
lot<00:02:14.250> about<00:02:15.530> there's<00:02:16.530> also<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:16.830> landing<00:02:17.430> gear

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
lot about there's also a landing gear

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.130 
lot about there's also a landing gear
which<00:02:17.850> isn't<00:02:18.030> that<00:02:18.239> good<00:02:18.570> actually<00:02:18.989> it's

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
which isn't that good actually it's

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.310 
which isn't that good actually it's
kinda<00:02:19.590> suckish<00:02:20.510> don't<00:02:21.510> really<00:02:21.690> tend<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:22.050> stand

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
kinda suckish don't really tend to stand

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.400 
kinda suckish don't really tend to stand
it<00:02:22.530> it<00:02:23.340> should<00:02:23.610> be<00:02:23.640> a<00:02:23.760> lot<00:02:23.940> tire<00:02:24.269> so<00:02:25.170> when<00:02:25.320> you

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
it it should be a lot tire so when you

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.830 
it it should be a lot tire so when you
stand<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:25.920> it<00:02:26.400> kind<00:02:26.610> of<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:27.209> know<00:02:27.239> just<00:02:27.600> Falls

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
stand it it kind of you know just Falls

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.210 
stand it it kind of you know just Falls
