for RC I'm the type of person that if I

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.990 
for RC I'm the type of person that if I
can<00:00:38.670> make<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:39.030> I'm<00:00:39.149> not<00:00:39.300> going<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.540> buy<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:40.530> I

the factory one this wood came off of it
what<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.600> did<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.110> actually<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.800> cut<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.730> all

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
baffle that was in there weld it back

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.210 
baffle that was in there weld it back
together<00:01:03.359> it's<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.080> crude<00:01:04.350> welding<00:01:04.739> job<00:01:04.949> but

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
together it's a crude welding job but

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:31.770 
together it's a crude welding job but
it'll<00:01:06.180> work<00:01:06.560> it'll<00:01:07.560> serve<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.920> purpose

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.740 

and<00:01:32.780> then<00:01:33.320> added<00:01:33.950> a<00:01:34.100> stack<00:01:34.730> on<00:01:34.940> here<00:01:35.150> otherwise

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
and then added a stack on here otherwise

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.520 
and then added a stack on here otherwise
the<00:01:36.140> actual<00:01:36.710> exhaust<00:01:37.040> came<00:01:38.030> out<00:01:38.210> here<00:01:38.630> which<00:01:39.350> I

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
the actual exhaust came out here which I

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.840 
the actual exhaust came out here which I
just<00:01:39.770> pounded<00:01:40.490> this<00:01:40.610> down<00:01:40.850> well<00:01:41.210> let<00:01:41.360> it<00:01:41.390> shut

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
just pounded this down well let it shut

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.000 
just pounded this down well let it shut
so<00:01:43.850> this<00:01:44.690> is<00:01:44.810> ready<00:01:44.990> to<00:01:45.110> go<00:01:45.230> almost<00:01:45.620> ready<00:01:45.920> to

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
so this is ready to go almost ready to

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.170 
so this is ready to go almost ready to
go<00:01:46.100> back<00:01:46.250> on<00:01:46.370> I<00:01:46.430> got<00:01:46.580> to<00:01:46.670> clean<00:01:46.880> it<00:01:46.970> up<00:01:47.030> a<00:01:47.120> little

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
go back on I got to clean it up a little

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.840 
go back on I got to clean it up a little
bit<00:01:47.480> here<00:01:47.690> clean<00:01:47.990> up<00:01:48.080> the<00:01:48.170> weld<00:01:48.380> and<00:01:48.650> then<00:01:49.550> for

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
bit here clean up the weld and then for

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.130 
bit here clean up the weld and then for
the<00:01:50.030> intake<00:01:51.220> on<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:52.490> carburetor<00:01:53.080> kind<00:01:54.080> of

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
the intake on the carburetor kind of

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.690 
the intake on the carburetor kind of
like<00:01:54.230> a<00:01:54.310> ram<00:01:55.310> air<00:01:55.550> or<00:01:55.790> forced<00:01:56.210> air<00:01:57.520> make<00:01:58.520> this

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
like a ram air or forced air make this

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.350 
like a ram air or forced air make this
little<00:01:59.290> stack<00:02:00.290> right<00:02:00.560> here<00:02:00.970> this<00:02:01.970> screws

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
little stack right here this screws

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.830 
little stack right here this screws
right<00:02:02.600> on<00:02:02.750> top<00:02:02.990> of<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:03.230> carb<00:02:04.360> this<00:02:05.360> angled

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
right on top of the carb this angled

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.919 
right on top of the carb this angled
part<00:02:06.080> right<00:02:06.200> here<00:02:06.440> actually<00:02:07.280> faces<00:02:07.790> the<00:02:08.630> prop

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
part right here actually faces the prop

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.550 
part right here actually faces the prop
so<00:02:09.260> say<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.280> prop<00:02:10.520> is<00:02:10.700> right<00:02:10.850> here<00:02:11.350> this<00:02:12.350> thing

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
so say the prop is right here this thing

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.420 
so say the prop is right here this thing
is<00:02:12.620> mounted<00:02:13.070> like<00:02:13.220> this<00:02:13.510> so<00:02:14.510> what<00:02:14.720> happens<00:02:15.110> is

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
is mounted like this so what happens is

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.150 
is mounted like this so what happens is
now<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.490> air<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:17.720> prop<00:02:18.020> wash<00:02:18.290> from<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:18.950> prop

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
now the air the prop wash from the prop

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.340 
now the air the prop wash from the prop
is<00:02:19.340> basically<00:02:20.060> thing<00:02:20.390> just<00:02:20.660> jammed<00:02:21.020> into<00:02:21.260> the

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
is basically thing just jammed into the

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.110 
is basically thing just jammed into the
car<00:02:21.650> right<00:02:22.430> down<00:02:22.580> the<00:02:22.760> throat<00:02:22.790> of<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.120> tube<00:02:25.120> so

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
car right down the throat of the tube so

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.720 
car right down the throat of the tube so
yeah<00:02:26.330> I'm<00:02:27.050> about<00:02:27.170> to<00:02:27.290> put<00:02:27.530> this<00:02:27.680> on<00:02:27.920> this<00:02:28.580> is

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
yeah I'm about to put this on this is
