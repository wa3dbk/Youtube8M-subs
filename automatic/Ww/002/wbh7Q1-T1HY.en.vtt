 Italian touch abbot 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.170
 which day is insisted here is the dough 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.750
 I have a video but I put it here 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.629
 they are 12 recipes to make two breads 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.469
 because very good comes 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.539
 bread and delicious and quick to my music him 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:55.440

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:59.100
 recipe true 222 bread made tell 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.870

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.970
 typewriters whom do you remember when I am so 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:09.439
 let's jump but then when i'm 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:13.770
 started using a lot of cons 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:17.640
 thoughts recipes in the sense that in the book 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:22.880
 for example just 4 recipes 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.880
 it's on plain white bread buns keychain 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.240
 they are only three and the white effects are trimmed 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.570
 wholemeal flour only then 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.570
 what 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.369
 accelerated for normal baking here 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.299
 Baking needs but the thing that I 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:48.299
 I tried my first bread 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.899
 I got a chamber to see 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:55.560
 then I got up and sank 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:57.149
 I did not like it in general, but part of them 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.880
 internal make there of course 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.159
 different from my past leboff and bat 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.829
 on and whether it is fine new yes what is there 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:11.190
 something wrong then 2 grids I tried 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:13.160
 already in my opinion they tried 1 recipe 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.630
 these old books 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.120
 old typewriter because there is little 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.400
 recipes or did not work okay I think 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.400
 Well, then try it from the new book 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.090
 just white bread for 5 turned out Christmas trees 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:30.540
 sticks on size so not coming 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.690
 account for them as on the internet my 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.830
 recipes for this machine kenwood 200 to 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.349
 350 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.060
 because there is no recipe but if there is 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.959
 some guys are wrong at all 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.299
 so there is someone who wants to take this machine 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.579
 this you have to work hard to look for besides 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:54.030
 recipe see me for years was myself 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:56.790
 edges Sasha so it is very uncomfortable that 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.489
 recipes are bad few recipes and pat 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.840
 Kid on a string there are many recipes here 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.239
 books him signals 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:07.380
 I don’t know it on the disk either 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:10.380
 recipes have to look and what else 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.310
 what minus i am still on my pair 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.040
 bread maker did 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.870
 dough for gave birth to ravioli for 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.050
 dumplings and chebureks matter in 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.770
 bread maker on my old car just 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.630
 two in three minutes he is here kneading dough 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.670
 one and a half chat and tactics 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.980
 domesticated from the dough even before now 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.290
 more up to 20 something I need so much 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.569
 wait for the frequency of the mission then the tree stick 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.690
 I ate Osama I'll try to knead 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:41.760
 dough in your combine all this is also a minus 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:44.380
 what's my tent stove minutes 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.019
 mystery minutes for twenty-three minutes 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:51.220
 reached dough awesome what she 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:53.319
 slow beautiful but if it is without 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.060
 yeast of course sure it 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:58.870
 ok effects for both dumplings for 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.910
 ravioli and for man but for pasta 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:08.080
 for climbing of course, too, came to this 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:10.660
 dough and this is some minus black bread 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:14.380
 bread i got my old stuff in the oven 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:19.299
 for two and a half chip well, somewhere 2 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:22.390
 o no hands for 33 34 to 36 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:25.330
 and in this new cleo oven volumes 434 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:27.660
 so I really want to get it 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:32.080
 certainly not profitable because more 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:36.130
 energy but what to do well then what 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:39.010
 cons still like my sporadic 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.850
 rode nickname was on the cover is big 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.039
 glass and 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.960
 and there it was light and all that was visible 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:46.180
 done inside described 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.669
 small-small window and black 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:53.590
 glass and everything is not clear sees nothing 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:56.229
 Well, the cost and how the CIA will check the enemies 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.500
 I don so who wants to choose you 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:01.250
 breadmaker choose 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:04.080
 very special 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:07.290
 I advise you to choose 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.509
 I ’ve delonghi stove 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:12.650
 on whether that department that became 3 each 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:15.960
 the car is not such as they say 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:19.350
 modern as this one is new 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:23.190
 headbutt but she is very cool awesome 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:25.710
 flowed any dairy French bread 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.300
 white plain and protein kim flour 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.699
 I can once again seeds 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:33.210
 I did it made even where the up 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:37.830
 grivus and awesome mobile parshin all 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:40.560
 makes it the only thing that seems to me 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:44.940
 that no longer issues such here 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:47.430
 you look at the car for a long time 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.020
 so when you get either stove 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.210
 I advise you delonghi 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:54.120
 which I was the author is very awesome 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:58.110
 floor stove and so here it is of course 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:00.720
 better but so far I found little pros 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:05.960
 can't see there is one plus that's what it is 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.960
 Of course most beautiful new here and 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.289
 what other advantages 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:18.340
 Nikolai never drank well 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:22.330
 okay okay, well, here I see 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:24.880
 trying brother still search for recipes herself still 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:27.040
 recipes on the internet and then one another 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:31.290
 then twitter so this and there is something fast 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:35.220
 read reviews and all sorts of reviews of people 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:38.340
 recipes read some chicks do 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.340
 party work 

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:47.230
 Kampala about my bread maker so far 

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:49.180
 more minuses than pluses so someone 

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:52.420
 asked me about the brand if you 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:53.620
 want to buy a bread maker you don't listen 

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:56.440
 do n't look at him 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:07:01.240
 kenwood not kenwood there did less breaking 

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:03.180
 you yourself are looking for on the Internet all the reviews about 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:06.640
 bread makers 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:09.580
 what programs are there and how many 

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:12.760
 of time it's all taking up this cool stove 

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:15.280
 when she does everything much longer than 

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:21.870
 I do not know the reason no more throw it big 

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:21.870
 there I was little but she was sitting 

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.919
 why suspicious
