in<00:00:00.089> this<00:00:00.210> video<00:00:00.450> I<00:00:00.570> want<00:00:00.870> to<00:00:00.900> discuss

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:01.260 
in this video I want to discuss

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.720 
in this video I want to discuss
something<00:00:01.730> another<00:00:03.080> element<00:00:04.080> in<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:05.279> process

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
something another element in the process

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.110 
something another element in the process
of<00:00:05.879> becoming<00:00:06.029> a<00:00:06.470> fast<00:00:07.470> at<00:00:07.859> playing<00:00:08.400> alternate

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
of becoming a fast at playing alternate

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.799 
of becoming a fast at playing alternate
pegging<00:00:09.510> which<00:00:10.230> is<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:11.099> movement<00:00:11.450> how<00:00:12.450> large

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
pegging which is the movement how large

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.620 
pegging which is the movement how large
the<00:00:13.349> movement<00:00:13.860> of<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.759> picking<00:00:15.210> hand<00:00:15.389> is

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
the movement of the picking hand is

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.680 
the movement of the picking hand is
whenever<00:00:15.960> it<00:00:16.320> is<00:00:16.470> playing<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.490> note<00:00:17.820> because

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
whenever it is playing and note because

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.840 
whenever it is playing and note because
if<00:00:19.109> you<00:00:19.199> want<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.500> play<00:00:19.680> fast<00:00:20.039> you<00:00:20.430> also<00:00:20.580> need

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
if you want to play fast you also need

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.480 
if you want to play fast you also need
to<00:00:20.880> decrease<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.590> amount<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.220> movement

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
to decrease the the amount of movement

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.089 
to decrease the the amount of movement
that<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.150> do<00:00:24.330> in<00:00:25.019> order<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.410> just<00:00:25.619> play<00:00:25.859> and

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
that you do in order to just play and

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.790 
that you do in order to just play and
note<00:00:27.529> in<00:00:28.529> general<00:00:29.750> in<00:00:30.750> here<00:00:31.019> this<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.529> very

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
note in general in here this is a very

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.950 
note in general in here this is a very
small<00:00:32.099> movement

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.280 

so<00:00:36.560> there's<00:00:37.340> no<00:00:37.490> need<00:00:37.670> to<00:00:37.730> play<00:00:38.480> such<00:00:38.930> a<00:00:38.960> large

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
so there's no need to play such a large

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.110 
so there's no need to play such a large
movement<00:00:39.590> when<00:00:40.190> you<00:00:40.280> can<00:00:40.490> play<00:00:40.730> the<00:00:40.880> same

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
movement when you can play the same

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.230 
movement when you can play the same
sound<00:00:41.420> with<00:00:41.840> such<00:00:42.080> a<00:00:42.110> small<00:00:43.150> of<00:00:44.150> course

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:44.240 
sound with such a small of course

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.410 
sound with such a small of course
there's<00:00:44.660> a<00:00:44.720> difference<00:00:45.590> in<00:00:45.850> in<00:00:46.850> if<00:00:47.240> you're

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
there's a difference in in if you're

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.290 
there's a difference in in if you're
just<00:00:47.450> playing<00:00:47.900> on<00:00:48.020> one<00:00:48.290> string<00:00:48.680> or<00:00:49.670> if<00:00:49.880> you<00:00:50.060> are

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
just playing on one string or if you are

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.660 
just playing on one string or if you are
moving<00:00:50.600> through<00:00:51.350> a<00:00:51.470> scale<00:00:51.800> that<00:00:52.220> covers<00:00:52.580> all

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
moving through a scale that covers all

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.750 
moving through a scale that covers all
six<00:00:53.030> strings<00:00:53.270> for<00:00:53.480> example<00:00:54.250> okay<00:00:55.250> we'll<00:00:55.610> get

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
six strings for example okay we'll get

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.670 
six strings for example okay we'll get
to<00:00:55.910> that<00:00:55.940> later<00:00:56.090> this<00:00:56.930> is<00:00:57.080> something<00:00:57.410> that<00:00:57.440> you

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
to that later this is something that you

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.290 
to that later this is something that you
can<00:00:57.830> absolutely<00:00:58.990> fix<00:00:59.990> very<00:01:00.560> easily<00:01:01.000> just<00:01:02.000> by

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
can absolutely fix very easily just by

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.680 
can absolutely fix very easily just by
having<00:01:02.780> your<00:01:02.930> keeping<00:01:03.320> your<00:01:03.470> focus<00:01:03.830> on<00:01:04.190> this

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
having your keeping your focus on this

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.830 
having your keeping your focus on this
element<00:01:05.690> for<00:01:06.440> a<00:01:06.470> few<00:01:06.800> weeks<00:01:07.180> whenever<00:01:08.180> you<00:01:08.630> are

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
element for a few weeks whenever you are

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.440 
element for a few weeks whenever you are
going<00:01:09.140> through<00:01:09.290> your<00:01:09.470> trills<00:01:09.770> and<00:01:10.150> the<00:01:11.150> scales

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
going through your trills and the scales

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.880 
going through your trills and the scales
and<00:01:11.720> whatever<00:01:13.450> so<00:01:14.450> what<00:01:14.630> you<00:01:14.720> could<00:01:14.869> do<00:01:15.050> is<00:01:15.290> you

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
and whatever so what you could do is you

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.609 
and whatever so what you could do is you
could<00:01:16.040> for<00:01:16.550> example<00:01:16.580> practice<00:01:17.479> phone<00:01:18.290> oppa

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
could for example practice phone oppa

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:24.490 
could for example practice phone oppa
string<00:01:18.970> pattern<00:01:22.210> and<00:01:23.210> then<00:01:23.420> experiment<00:01:24.110> on

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
string pattern and then experiment on

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.960 
string pattern and then experiment on
how<00:01:25.210> little<00:01:26.210> you<00:01:26.479> can<00:01:26.660> use<00:01:27.550> how<00:01:28.550> little<00:01:28.760> of<00:01:28.910> the

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
how little you can use how little of the

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.940 
how little you can use how little of the
pic<00:01:29.240> you<00:01:29.390> can<00:01:29.570> use<00:01:29.780> to<00:01:30.080> produce<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:30.770> same

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
pic you can use to produce the same

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.530 
pic you can use to produce the same
amount<00:01:31.130> of<00:01:32.229> sound

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.300 

actually<00:01:38.540> also<00:01:38.710> another<00:01:39.710> extremely

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
actually also another extremely

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.520 
actually also another extremely
important<00:01:40.640> thing<00:01:40.790> is<00:01:40.970> the<00:01:41.480> the<00:01:41.900> smaller<00:01:42.290> the

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
important thing is the the smaller the

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.520 
important thing is the the smaller the
movement<00:01:42.920> is<00:01:43.070> the<00:01:43.310> easier<00:01:43.700> it<00:01:43.760> becomes<00:01:44.120> to<00:01:44.530> to

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
movement is the easier it becomes to to

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.980 
movement is the easier it becomes to to
find<00:01:45.770> the<00:01:45.980> perfect<00:01:46.690> synchronicity<00:01:47.690> between

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
find the perfect synchronicity between

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.910 
find the perfect synchronicity between
right<00:01:48.860> and<00:01:49.010> left<00:01:49.220> hand<00:01:49.930> so<00:01:50.930> the<00:01:51.260> larger<00:01:51.740> the

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
right and left hand so the larger the

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.580 
right and left hand so the larger the
movement<00:01:52.310> is<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:53.390> more<00:01:53.600> precise<00:01:54.050> it<00:01:54.260> has<00:01:54.410> to

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
movement is the more precise it has to

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.160 
movement is the more precise it has to
be<00:01:54.740> so<00:01:55.070> keep<00:01:55.580> the<00:01:55.760> movement<00:01:56.150> as<00:01:56.720> small<00:01:57.020> as

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
be so keep the movement as small as

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.280 
be so keep the movement as small as
possible

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.870 

I<00:02:03.320> just<00:02:03.620> you<00:02:04.100> can<00:02:04.220> choose<00:02:04.400> whatever<00:02:04.610> you<00:02:04.790> want

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
I just you can choose whatever you want

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.990 
I just you can choose whatever you want
to<00:02:05.150> play<00:02:05.570> on<00:02:05.720> the<00:02:06.130> fret<00:02:07.130> board<00:02:07.160> in<00:02:07.580> whatever

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
to play on the fret board in whatever

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.609 
to play on the fret board in whatever
string<00:02:08.390> but<00:02:08.570> in<00:02:08.660> this<00:02:08.780> case<00:02:09.020> I<00:02:09.080> just<00:02:09.200> chose

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
string but in this case I just chose

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.030 
string but in this case I just chose
seven<00:02:10.100> nine<00:02:10.340> ten<00:02:10.700> twelve<00:02:11.890> back-and-forth

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
seven nine ten twelve back-and-forth

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:20.920 
seven nine ten twelve back-and-forth
string<00:02:17.800> the<00:02:18.800> other<00:02:18.830> thing<00:02:19.430> is<00:02:19.820> if<00:02:20.450> I<00:02:20.600> choose<00:02:20.780> to

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
string the other thing is if I choose to

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:28.120 
string the other thing is if I choose to
play<00:02:21.080> through<00:02:21.320> a<00:02:21.380> whole<00:02:21.650> scale<00:02:26.830> you<00:02:27.830> know<00:02:27.890> just

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
play through a whole scale you know just

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.910 
play through a whole scale you know just
play<00:02:28.310> a<00:02:28.340> B<00:02:28.640> major<00:02:28.880> scale<00:02:32.650> then<00:02:33.650> this<00:02:33.800> is<00:02:33.890> a

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
play a B major scale then this is a

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:44.080 
play a B major scale then this is a
different<00:02:34.310> situation<00:02:42.040> then<00:02:43.040> there's<00:02:43.370> a<00:02:43.610> in

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
different situation then there's a in

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.540 
different situation then there's a in
every<00:02:44.450> case<00:02:44.840> in<00:02:45.170> in<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:45.620> case<00:02:45.830> where<00:02:46.100> I<00:02:46.130> move

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
every case in in the case where I move

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.430 
every case in in the case where I move
from<00:02:46.820> one<00:02:47.120> string<00:02:47.390> to<00:02:47.450> another<00:02:47.600> then<00:02:48.260> there's

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
from one string to another then there's

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.140 
from one string to another then there's
of<00:02:48.590> course<00:02:48.800> there's<00:02:49.010> a<00:02:49.100> limit<00:02:49.459> on<00:02:49.580> how<00:02:49.820> small<00:02:50.090> I

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
of course there's a limit on how small I

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.810 
of course there's a limit on how small I
can<00:02:50.480> make<00:02:50.690> the<00:02:50.930> movement<00:02:51.350> because<00:02:51.620> I<00:02:51.890> still<00:02:52.610> do

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
can make the movement because I still do

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.460 
can make the movement because I still do
have<00:02:53.030> to<00:02:53.500> get<00:02:54.500> across<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:55.220> string<00:02:56.350> in<00:02:57.350> order

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
have to get across the string in order

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.949 
have to get across the string in order
to<00:02:57.650> play<00:02:57.890> the<00:02:58.070> next<00:02:58.190> note<00:02:58.340> but<00:02:59.239> whenever<00:02:59.840> I

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
to play the next note but whenever I

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.150 
to play the next note but whenever I
believe<00:03:00.260> if<00:03:00.410> I<00:03:00.530> play<00:03:00.709> a<00:03:00.739> three<00:03:00.980> note<00:03:01.130> per

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
believe if I play a three note per

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.570 
believe if I play a three note per
string<00:03:01.250> per<00:03:01.580> position<00:03:02.360> for<00:03:02.630> example<00:03:03.340> on<00:03:04.340> all

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
string per position for example on all

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.540 
string per position for example on all
the<00:03:04.790> other<00:03:05.000> strings<00:03:05.420> I<00:03:05.660> can<00:03:05.900> still<00:03:06.489> keep<00:03:07.489> the

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
the other strings I can still keep the

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.729 
the other strings I can still keep the
amount<00:03:08.180> of<00:03:08.390> movement<00:03:08.810> as<00:03:08.959> small<00:03:09.320> as<00:03:09.500> possible

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
amount of movement as small as possible

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.199 
amount of movement as small as possible
and<00:03:10.450> another<00:03:11.450> thing<00:03:11.690> I<00:03:11.840> added<00:03:12.350> to<00:03:12.470> that<00:03:12.620> is

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
and another thing I added to that is

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.490 
and another thing I added to that is
whenever<00:03:14.209> you<00:03:14.600> move<00:03:14.780> from<00:03:14.989> one<00:03:15.080> string<00:03:15.470> to

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
whenever you move from one string to

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.040 
whenever you move from one string to
another<00:03:15.680> you<00:03:16.459> should<00:03:16.489> keep<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.270> amount<00:03:17.870> of

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
another you should keep the amount of

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.190 
another you should keep the amount of
movement<00:03:18.260> as<00:03:18.950> small<00:03:19.340> as<00:03:19.459> possible<00:03:20.030> as<00:03:20.239> well<00:03:20.690> as

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
movement as small as possible as well as

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.850 
movement as small as possible as well as
when<00:03:21.860> you<00:03:21.980> play<00:03:22.130> on<00:03:22.160> one<00:03:22.400> string<00:03:22.640> because<00:03:23.860> if

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
when you play on one string because if

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.550 
when you play on one string because if
you<00:03:25.130> make<00:03:25.400> it<00:03:25.520> a<00:03:25.580> very<00:03:25.700> large<00:03:26.120> movement<00:03:26.560> that's

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
you make it a very large movement that's

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.360 
you make it a very large movement that's
also<00:03:27.970> you<00:03:28.970> increase<00:03:29.360> the<00:03:29.600> possibility<00:03:30.320> of

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
also you increase the possibility of

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.710 
also you increase the possibility of
hitting<00:03:31.370> the<00:03:31.489> other<00:03:31.610> strings<00:03:32.030> so<00:03:32.330> you<00:03:32.390> still

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
hitting the other strings so you still

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.440 
hitting the other strings so you still
want<00:03:32.930> to<00:03:33.020> keep<00:03:33.200> the<00:03:33.800> movement<00:03:34.730> as<00:03:34.970> small<00:03:35.300> as

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
want to keep the movement as small as

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.600 
want to keep the movement as small as
small<00:03:35.930> as<00:03:36.050> possible<00:03:36.230> take<00:03:36.920> a<00:03:36.950> look<00:03:37.190> here<00:03:37.370> how

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
small as possible take a look here how

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.229 
small as possible take a look here how
it<00:03:37.730> looks<00:03:37.970> when<00:03:38.480> I<00:03:38.510> play<00:03:38.780> through<00:03:39.020> a<00:03:39.080> scale

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
it looks when I play through a scale

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.480 
it looks when I play through a scale
I<00:03:41.239> choose<00:03:41.690> another<00:03:41.959> scale<00:03:42.350> now

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.490 
I choose another scale now

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.830 
I choose another scale now
so<00:03:44.490> my<00:03:44.700> fingers<00:03:45.030> don't<00:03:45.240> get<00:03:45.450> in<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.630> way<00:03:45.780> you

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
so my fingers don't get in the way you

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.680 
so my fingers don't get in the way you
can<00:03:46.080> see<00:03:46.200> you<00:03:46.350> can<00:03:46.640> still<00:03:47.640> keep<00:03:47.850> a<00:03:48.000> very<00:03:48.240> small

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
can see you can still keep a very small

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:57.730 
can see you can still keep a very small
amount<00:03:49.680> of<00:03:49.860> movement<00:03:50.130> here<00:03:50.660> taking<00:03:51.660> hand

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.960 

what<00:03:58.740> you<00:03:58.830> do<00:03:58.950> is<00:03:59.100> you<00:03:59.160> do<00:03:59.280> is<00:03:59.430> this<00:03:59.670> is<00:03:59.730> not

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
what you do is you do is this is not

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.460 
what you do is you do is this is not
something<00:04:00.300> you<00:04:00.390> do<00:04:00.570> with<00:04:00.780> a<00:04:00.810> metronome<00:04:01.200> or

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
something you do with a metronome or

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.900 
something you do with a metronome or
anything<00:04:01.650> this<00:04:01.920> is<00:04:01.980> just<00:04:02.100> something<00:04:02.520> you<00:04:02.730> go

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
anything this is just something you go

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.400 
anything this is just something you go
through<00:04:03.120> a<00:04:03.210> scale<00:04:03.650> and<00:04:04.650> keep<00:04:04.920> your<00:04:05.100> focus<00:04:05.790> on

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
through a scale and keep your focus on

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.560 
through a scale and keep your focus on
on<00:04:07.410> the<00:04:08.190> picking<00:04:08.520> hand<00:04:08.700> instead<00:04:09.120> up<00:04:09.240> on<00:04:09.390> the

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
on the picking hand instead up on the

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.390 
on the picking hand instead up on the
fretting<00:04:09.990> hand<00:04:10.020> and<00:04:10.470> said<00:04:10.800> you<00:04:11.040> don't<00:04:11.160> have

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
fretting hand and said you don't have

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.610 
fretting hand and said you don't have
really<00:04:11.640> to<00:04:11.880> look<00:04:12.510> that<00:04:12.690> much<00:04:12.960> just<00:04:13.140> to<00:04:13.290> feel

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
really to look that much just to feel

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.760 
really to look that much just to feel
how<00:04:13.950> close<00:04:14.220> you<00:04:14.520> get<00:04:14.820> to<00:04:14.880> the<00:04:15.120> strings<00:04:15.710> kind<00:04:16.710> of

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:16.770 
how close you get to the strings kind of

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:22.850 
how close you get to the strings kind of
a<00:04:16.860> Jedi<00:04:17.130> mind<00:04:17.520> technique<00:04:21.020> slowly<00:04:22.020> do<00:04:22.530> it<00:04:22.680> the

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
a Jedi mind technique slowly do it the

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.670 
a Jedi mind technique slowly do it the
more<00:04:23.130> precise<00:04:23.610> you<00:04:23.880> can<00:04:23.990> make<00:04:24.990> the<00:04:25.140> techniques

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
more precise you can make the techniques

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.410 
more precise you can make the techniques
it's<00:04:25.920> really<00:04:26.250> nerdy<00:04:26.460> stuff<00:04:26.670> but<00:04:27.120> it<00:04:27.210> actually

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
it's really nerdy stuff but it actually

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.100 
it's really nerdy stuff but it actually
will<00:04:27.990> leverage<00:04:28.400> the<00:04:29.400> speed<00:04:29.850> once<00:04:30.840> you<00:04:30.930> get

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
will leverage the speed once you get

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.000 
will leverage the speed once you get
this<00:04:31.260> technique<00:04:31.770> down<00:04:31.950> will<00:04:32.730> better<00:04:33.000> the<00:04:33.330> the

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
this technique down will better the the

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.700 
this technique down will better the the
possibility<00:04:35.010> of<00:04:35.220> increasing<00:04:35.880> the<00:04:36.120> speed<00:04:36.710> when

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
possibility of increasing the speed when

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.000 
possibility of increasing the speed when
you<00:04:37.950> do<00:04:38.100> stuff<00:04:38.670> like<00:04:38.850> this<00:04:39.380> and<00:04:40.380> get<00:04:40.680> it<00:04:40.800> down

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
you do stuff like this and get it down

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:48.940 
you do stuff like this and get it down
get<00:04:41.850> used<00:04:42.150> to<00:04:42.360> it<00:04:44.060> and<00:04:45.060> then<00:04:45.720> also<00:04:47.570> can<00:04:48.570> you

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
get used to it and then also can you

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.670 
get used to it and then also can you
experiment<00:04:49.950> do<00:04:50.280> the<00:04:50.430> phone<00:04:50.700> of<00:04:50.820> the<00:04:50.940> string

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
experiment do the phone of the string

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.710 
experiment do the phone of the string
it's<00:04:52.680> just<00:04:52.920> a<00:04:53.130> form<00:04:53.880> of<00:04:53.940> a<00:04:54.000> string<00:04:54.210> yeah<00:04:54.420> on<00:04:54.690> a

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
you can move the hand it's very little

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.120 
you can move the hand it's very little
