usually<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:53.699> if<00:00:54.090> they<00:00:54.390> didn't<00:00:54.690> if<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:54.989> wasn't

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
usually is if they didn't if it wasn't

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.450 
usually is if they didn't if it wasn't
right<00:00:55.469> then<00:00:55.680> they<00:00:55.770> wouldn't<00:00:55.980> have<00:00:56.039> put<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.370> on

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
right then they wouldn't have put it on

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.150 
right then they wouldn't have put it on
the<00:00:56.579> schedule<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:57.350> on<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.620> we<00:00:58.770> will<00:00:58.949> see

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.640 
Undertaker on this Monday Night Raw and
now<00:01:02.250> this<00:01:02.579> raises<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.359> huge<00:01:03.719> question<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.439> he

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
now this raises the huge question is he

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.649 
now this raises the huge question is he
going<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.040> return<00:01:05.339> at<00:01:05.580> battleground<00:01:05.970> or<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.540> he

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
going to return at battleground or is he

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.830 
going to return at battleground or is he
just<00:01:06.689> going<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.260> return<00:01:07.590> on<00:01:07.830> Raw<00:01:08.150> is<00:01:09.150> very

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
just going to return on Raw is very

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.990 
just going to return on Raw is very
insane<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.830> other<00:01:10.979> big<00:01:11.250> question<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.820> who

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
insane and the other big question is who

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.469 
insane and the other big question is who
will<00:01:12.180> he<00:01:12.330> be<00:01:12.479> facing<00:01:12.780> now<00:01:13.560> my<00:01:14.400> idea<00:01:14.580> even

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
will he be facing now my idea even

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.630 
will he be facing now my idea even
though<00:01:15.810> we've<00:01:15.990> already<00:01:16.170> seen<00:01:16.470> Triple<00:01:16.920> H<00:01:17.070> face

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.270 
though we've already seen Triple H face
the<00:01:17.880> Undertaker<00:01:18.330> multiple<00:01:18.990> times<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.560> think<00:01:20.159> we

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
the Undertaker multiple times I think we

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.140 
the Undertaker multiple times I think we
got<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.580> see<00:01:21.290> if<00:01:22.290> it's<00:01:22.619> possible<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.549> set<00:01:24.000> up

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150
