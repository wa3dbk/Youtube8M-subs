considerations you know chorong bins

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.820 
considerations you know chorong bins
making<00:00:26.270> sure<00:00:26.420> your<00:00:26.779> your<00:00:27.170> corn<00:00:27.440> has<00:00:27.650> the

making sure your your corn has the
ability<00:00:28.190> you<00:00:28.670> know<00:00:28.760> to<00:00:29.290> to<00:00:30.290> store<00:00:30.529> for<00:00:30.800> through

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
ability you know to to store for through

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.430 
ability you know to to store for through
the<00:00:31.580> winter<00:00:31.759> yeah<00:00:32.390> so<00:00:32.689> once<00:00:33.110> it's<00:00:33.290> gone

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
the winter yeah so once it's gone

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.040 
the winter yeah so once it's gone
through<00:00:33.650> the<00:00:33.830> dryer<00:00:34.210> we<00:00:35.210> cool<00:00:35.480> it<00:00:35.510> out<00:00:35.780> and

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
through the dryer we cool it out and

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.560 
through the dryer we cool it out and
then<00:00:36.170> it's<00:00:36.320> put<00:00:36.560> into<00:00:36.890> storage<00:00:37.850> bins<00:00:38.270> for

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
then it's put into storage bins for

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.760 
then it's put into storage bins for
short<00:00:39.500> term<00:00:39.740> or<00:00:39.950> possibly<00:00:40.280> long<00:00:40.520> term<00:00:40.790> storage

you<00:00:42.770> know<00:00:42.860> you've<00:00:43.310> got<00:00:43.460> a<00:00:43.489> certain<00:00:43.760> quality

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
you know you've got a certain quality

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.430 
you know you've got a certain quality
there<00:00:44.570> in<00:00:45.320> order<00:00:45.740> to<00:00:46.420> maximize<00:00:47.420> the<00:00:47.780> aeration

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
there in order to maximize the aeration

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.250 
there in order to maximize the aeration
capability<00:00:49.160> of<00:00:49.280> your<00:00:49.430> system<00:00:49.900> when<00:00:50.900> you<00:00:51.020> put

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
capability of your system when you put

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.140 
capability of your system when you put
corn<00:00:51.530> into<00:00:51.800> a<00:00:51.830> bin<00:00:52.070> the<00:00:52.430> fines<00:00:52.700> tend<00:00:53.000> to

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.150 
corn into a bin the fines tend to

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.000 
corn into a bin the fines tend to
congregate<00:00:53.660> in<00:00:53.840> the<00:00:54.080> center<00:00:54.380> of<00:00:54.500> the<00:00:54.590> bin<00:00:54.740> and

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
congregate in the center of the bin and

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.730 
congregate in the center of the bin and
if<00:00:55.970> they're<00:00:56.270> left<00:00:56.630> there<00:00:57.140> in<00:00:57.380> other<00:00:57.470> words<00:00:57.680> you

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:57.740 
if they're left there in other words you

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.800 
if they're left there in other words you
don't<00:00:57.890> do<00:00:58.040> anything<00:00:58.220> about<00:00:58.400> it<00:00:58.540> the<00:00:59.540> air<00:00:59.690> is

00:00:59.800 --> 00:00:59.810 
don't do anything about it the air is

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.150 
don't do anything about it the air is
going<00:00:59.960> to<00:01:00.020> the<00:01:00.320> aeration<00:01:00.590> air<00:01:00.860> is<00:01:00.980> going<00:01:01.070> to

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
going to the aeration air is going to

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.860 
going to the aeration air is going to
take<00:01:01.310> the<00:01:01.430> easiest<00:01:01.850> way<00:01:02.120> through<00:01:02.420> that<00:01:02.600> bin

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
take the easiest way through that bin

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.289 
take the easiest way through that bin
which<00:01:03.500> is<00:01:03.740> around<00:01:04.040> the<00:01:04.339> edges<00:01:04.850> or<00:01:05.030> the<00:01:05.059> outside

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
which is around the edges or the outside

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:07.630 
which is around the edges or the outside
of<00:01:05.570> the<00:01:05.750> bin<00:01:05.960> because<00:01:06.140> the<00:01:06.950> fines<00:01:07.250> in<00:01:07.610> the

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
of the bin because the fines in the

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.840 
of the bin because the fines in the
center<00:01:08.119> impede<00:01:08.900> air<00:01:09.170> flow<00:01:09.590> and<00:01:09.890> the<00:01:10.430> air<00:01:10.549> takes

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
center impede air flow and the air takes

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.270 
center impede air flow and the air takes
the<00:01:11.030> path<00:01:11.299> of<00:01:11.509> least<00:01:11.570> resistance<00:01:11.810> by<00:01:12.799> coring

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
the path of least resistance by coring

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.160 
the path of least resistance by coring
the<00:01:13.400> bin<00:01:13.610> you<00:01:13.880> do<00:01:14.330> two<00:01:14.540> things<00:01:14.750> one<00:01:15.140> you

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
the bin you do two things one you

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.440 
the bin you do two things one you
establish<00:01:15.860> the<00:01:16.009> flow<00:01:16.220> funnel<00:01:16.700> no<00:01:17.180> words<00:01:17.329> it's

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
establish the flow funnel no words it's

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.330 
establish the flow funnel no words it's
going<00:01:17.749> down<00:01:17.960> through<00:01:18.469> the<00:01:18.679> unloading<00:01:19.130> grade

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
going down through the unloading grade

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.370 
going down through the unloading grade
at<00:01:19.490> the<00:01:19.579> bottom<00:01:19.850> of<00:01:19.939> the<00:01:19.999> bin<00:01:20.179> and<00:01:20.359> second<00:01:21.200> you

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
at the bottom of the bin and second you

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.550 
at the bottom of the bin and second you
remove<00:01:21.920> or<00:01:22.509> yeah<00:01:23.509> you<00:01:23.539> remove<00:01:24.049> most<00:01:24.350> of<00:01:24.499> the

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
remove or yeah you remove most of the

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.550 
remove or yeah you remove most of the
fines<00:01:24.859> in<00:01:25.130> the<00:01:25.189> center<00:01:25.670> of<00:01:25.759> the<00:01:25.850> bin<00:01:26.560> ideally

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
fines in the center of the bin ideally

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.649 
fines in the center of the bin ideally
you'd<00:01:27.679> like<00:01:27.859> to<00:01:27.979> see<00:01:28.159> that<00:01:28.189> material<00:01:28.969> cleaned

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
you'd like to see that material cleaned

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.160 
you'd like to see that material cleaned
and<00:01:29.990> then<00:01:30.200> put<00:01:30.469> back<00:01:30.649> in<00:01:30.890> the<00:01:31.009> bin<00:01:32.170> practically

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
and then put back in the bin practically

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.230 
and then put back in the bin practically
you<00:01:33.770> could<00:01:34.009> take<00:01:34.219> that<00:01:34.369> material<00:01:34.520> out<00:01:34.880> to<00:01:34.909> put

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
you could take that material out to put

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.480 
you could take that material out to put
it<00:01:35.329> right<00:01:35.479> back<00:01:35.719> in<00:01:35.960> that<00:01:36.079> same<00:01:36.319> bin<00:01:36.649> the<00:01:37.249> fact

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
it right back in that same bin the fact

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.099 
it right back in that same bin the fact
that<00:01:37.609> you've<00:01:37.819> moved<00:01:38.119> it<00:01:38.359> out<00:01:38.539> of<00:01:38.689> the<00:01:38.749> bin<00:01:38.929> and

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:39.109 
that you've moved it out of the bin and

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:41.919 
that you've moved it out of the bin and
back<00:01:39.259> in<00:01:39.499> the<00:01:40.130> the<00:01:40.999> problem<00:01:41.420> with<00:01:41.569> the<00:01:41.689> fines

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:41.929 
back in the the problem with the fines

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:43.899 
back in the the problem with the fines
is<00:01:42.200> less<00:01:42.560> severe<00:01:42.979> than<00:01:43.189> if<00:01:43.310> you<00:01:43.399> hadn't<00:01:43.700> cored

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
is less severe than if you hadn't cored

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.179 
is less severe than if you hadn't cored
the<00:01:44.030> bin<00:01:44.149> at<00:01:44.299> all<00:01:44.450> what<00:01:45.289> about<00:01:45.469> your<00:01:45.679> bins<00:01:45.950> I

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
the bin at all what about your bins I

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:47.440 
the bin at all what about your bins I
mean<00:01:46.340> what<00:01:46.490> type<00:01:46.789> of<00:01:46.819> diligence<00:01:47.389> should

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
mean what type of diligence should

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.419 
mean what type of diligence should
growers<00:01:48.109> be<00:01:48.259> doing<00:01:48.530> to<00:01:48.649> check<00:01:48.829> out<00:01:48.979> those<00:01:49.159> bins

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429 
growers be doing to check out those bins

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:52.599 
growers be doing to check out those bins
before<00:01:49.819> you<00:01:49.880> start<00:01:50.090> loading<00:01:50.299> them<00:01:50.450> up<00:01:51.609> ideally

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:52.609 
before you start loading them up ideally

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:55.480 
before you start loading them up ideally
you<00:01:53.210> know<00:01:53.329> the<00:01:54.319> the<00:01:54.530> bin<00:01:54.710> should<00:01:54.740> be<00:01:54.979> clean<00:01:55.280> as

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
you know the the bin should be clean as

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.949 
you know the the bin should be clean as
much<00:01:55.670> as<00:01:55.850> possible<00:01:56.060> and<00:01:56.479> one<00:01:56.600> of<00:01:56.749> the<00:01:56.810> things

00:01:56.949 --> 00:01:56.959 
much as possible and one of the things

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:59.679 
much as possible and one of the things
we<00:01:57.139> talk<00:01:57.350> about<00:01:57.530> is<00:01:57.939> cleaning<00:01:58.939> underneath<00:01:59.359> the

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
we talk about is cleaning underneath the

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:02.379 
we talk about is cleaning underneath the
floor<00:01:59.929> not<00:02:00.920> many<00:02:01.159> people<00:02:01.369> do<00:02:01.670> it<00:02:01.700> because<00:02:01.969> if

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:02.389 
floor not many people do it because if

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:03.940 
floor not many people do it because if
you<00:02:02.539> if<00:02:02.869> you<00:02:02.990> find<00:02:03.259> a<00:02:03.350> problem<00:02:03.590> you<00:02:03.829> really

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
you if you find a problem you really
