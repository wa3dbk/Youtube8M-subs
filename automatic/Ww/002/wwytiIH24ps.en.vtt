00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:14.440
 ball to all of us guys here are packed 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:17.660
 in reality see this tutorial 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:21.340
 very simple 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.340
 and requires first 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.550
 owning your own 5 gta 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.170
 this is not what we were interested in 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.050
 this beautiful ticket here that should 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.360
 be present in all pairs if 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.780
 I'm not mistaken even the basic versions one 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.730
 which I own and of course 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.829
 however if you take it used you risk that 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:51.320
 the code already redeemed by 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:53.360
 former owner once 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:58.730
 you have found the leaflet you have to go 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:05.630
 on the playstation store and now you have to 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:10.509
 scroll down to 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.509
 reach the redeem codes section 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.899
 here you must enter your code 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:22.640
 obviously I don't insert it because 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:28.330
 already unloaded dream was not on 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:30.860
 sign your grandfather 98 and offline 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:34.280
 view content here it is 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:37.369
 expect that charge as you see are 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.150
 only 100 kb so really very small 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:44.270
 the size in fact the download lasted 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:46.159
 a second in practice after doing 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.079
 so you will have this operation 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.479
 installed 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:52.780
 but now let's see how we can do it 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.780
 use 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:02:14.360
 then from your to the fruit you want to go 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:16.970
 in contacts and look for blimp as you have 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.540
 seen this senorita will answer 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.180
 which will make us airship available 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.490
 in the nearest port we say to the 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.230
 position from which you then call in 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:32.680
 this case I called from the house of 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.680
 michael is where the airship is located 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:40.610
 ok now that you have reached the place 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:44.440
 we can admire the majesty of 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.440
 this fantastic vehicle 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:57.140
 here it is but between yellow and blue mac blend 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:03:00.500
 indeed blue here is the piloting is 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.910
 really very simple and at a 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.940
 airship I also think it goes 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.820
 fast enough because we can 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:12.070
 note it is not really slow but it is clumsy 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.070
 in the movements to tack 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.240
 so it's not really ideal for 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.290
 pass in the midst of skyscrapers and 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.880
 palaces that say guys this was a 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.350
 tutorial just for the people who me 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.950
 very few have ever redeemed a code 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:33.370
 I think 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.370
 so let's see you at a next video 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.670
 no
