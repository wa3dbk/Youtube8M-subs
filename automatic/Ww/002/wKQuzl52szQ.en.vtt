and<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.650> cuticles<00:00:14.070> are<00:00:14.160> nice<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:14.490> tidy<00:00:14.670> and

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
and the cuticles are nice and tidy and

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.360 
and the cuticles are nice and tidy and
then<00:00:15.900> you<00:00:15.990> can<00:00:16.170> decide<00:00:16.470> if<00:00:16.530> you<00:00:16.710> need<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.160> put

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:17.370 
then you can decide if you need to put

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.000 
then you can decide if you need to put
any<00:00:17.580> cotton<00:00:18.060> wool<00:00:18.240> in<00:00:18.510> between<00:00:18.930> any<00:00:19.650> of<00:00:19.830> the

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
any cotton wool in between any of the

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.860 
any cotton wool in between any of the
tools<00:00:20.250> if<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:20.880> do<00:00:21.000> just<00:00:21.210> pull<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.540> little<00:00:21.600> bit

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:21.870 
tools if you do just pull a little bit

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.950 
tools if you do just pull a little bit
rule<00:00:22.740> enter<00:00:23.160> Bowl<00:00:23.370> and<00:00:23.640> pop<00:00:24.540> it<00:00:24.690> in<00:00:24.780> between

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
rule enter Bowl and pop it in between

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.660 
rule enter Bowl and pop it in between
and<00:00:25.380> that<00:00:25.410> means<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:26.010> you're<00:00:26.130> not<00:00:26.160> going<00:00:26.430> to

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
and that means that you're not going to

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.610 
and that means that you're not going to
get<00:00:26.790> any<00:00:27.090> nail<00:00:27.300> polish<00:00:27.540> transferred<00:00:28.200> onto<00:00:28.440> the

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:28.620 
get any nail polish transferred onto the

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.680 
get any nail polish transferred onto the
skin<00:00:28.860> on<00:00:29.010> either<00:00:29.100> side<00:00:29.430> or<00:00:29.940> you<00:00:30.270> can<00:00:30.300> use<00:00:30.660> a

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:30.690 
skin on either side or you can use a

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.659 
skin on either side or you can use a
tool<00:00:30.990> separator<00:00:31.530> but<00:00:31.950> we<00:00:32.070> found<00:00:32.189> these<00:00:32.399> quite

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
tool separator but we found these quite

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.430 
tool separator but we found these quite
awkward<00:00:33.030> so<00:00:33.149> I<00:00:33.180> preferred<00:00:33.570> doing<00:00:33.899> it<00:00:34.020> with<00:00:34.260> the

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
awkward so I preferred doing it with the

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.470 
awkward so I preferred doing it with the
cotton<00:00:34.710> mill<00:00:34.829> method<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:35.850> just<00:00:36.059> make<00:00:36.210> sure

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
cotton mill method so just make sure

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.079 
cotton mill method so just make sure
that<00:00:36.739> no<00:00:37.739> needles<00:00:38.160> for<00:00:38.370> instance<00:00:38.670> this<00:00:38.850> one

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:39.089 
that no needles for instance this one

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:40.880 
that no needles for instance this one
could<00:00:39.749> actually<00:00:39.870> end<00:00:40.199> up<00:00:40.289> getting<00:00:40.469> some<00:00:40.739> nail

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
could actually end up getting some nail

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.610 
could actually end up getting some nail
polish<00:00:41.190> onto<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.929> adjoining<00:00:42.929> tool<00:00:43.289> so<00:00:43.469> just

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
polish onto the adjoining tool so just

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.680 
polish onto the adjoining tool so just
pop<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.800> little<00:00:44.039> bit<00:00:44.219> there<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:45.179> separates

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
pop a little bit there and it separates

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.290 
pop a little bit there and it separates
them<00:00:45.839> for<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.820> then<00:00:47.820> if<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.120> had<00:00:48.269> a

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
them for you and then if you had a

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.419 
them for you and then if you had a
client<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.989> they're<00:00:49.379> getting<00:00:49.620> ready<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.949> go

00:00:50.419 --> 00:00:50.429 
client and they're getting ready to go

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:51.709 
client and they're getting ready to go
and<00:00:50.879> leave<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.149> cell<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.510> when<00:00:51.600> you're

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
and leave the cell and when you're

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.360 
and leave the cell and when you're
finished<00:00:51.839> then<00:00:52.530> what<00:00:52.769> you<00:00:52.859> would<00:00:52.980> do<00:00:53.069> is<00:00:53.190> ask

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
finished then what you would do is ask

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.950 
finished then what you would do is ask
them<00:00:53.519> to<00:00:53.670> bring<00:00:53.760> flipflops<00:00:54.210> with<00:00:54.539> them<00:00:54.719> so

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
them to bring flipflops with them so

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.840 
them to bring flipflops with them so
they<00:00:55.109> can<00:00:55.140> pop<00:00:55.499> them<00:00:55.679> on<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.100> then<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.699> can

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
they can pop them on and then you can

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.369 
they can pop them on and then you can
paint<00:00:57.179> the<00:00:57.300> nails<00:00:57.479> and<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:57.839> way<00:00:58.019> there's<00:00:58.260> no

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
paint the nails and that way there's no

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.419 
paint the nails and that way there's no
chance<00:00:58.409> that<00:00:58.829> they're<00:00:58.979> going<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.159> smudge

00:00:59.419 --> 00:00:59.429 
chance that they're going to smudge

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:01.340 
chance that they're going to smudge
their<00:00:59.670> nails<00:00:59.819> after<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.239> finished<00:01:00.539> them<00:01:00.719> but

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350
