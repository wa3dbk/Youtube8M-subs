00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello to all and all youtube friends 

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.470
 today I want to introduce you to my character 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:13.440
 of the world of warcraft is called or more 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:19.789
 witch level 85 half team 3 93 91 as 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:23.859
 see here 384 3 97 84 97 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.859
 104 97 84 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.460
 what I do have to change 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.800
 urgently are the pants and this 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:34.890
 but good otherwise good 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:39.000
 then I want you I want to show you my 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.690
 rotation and my dps and pretty much the 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.690
 character itself 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.320
 I am demonology 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.039
 the bending and destruction is going very wrong 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.370
 so I'm always demonology with 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.180
 my vile guard 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.309
 so let's try the dps first 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.579
 that he always used is equal 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.710
 apocalyptic 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.350
 metamorphosis and I start here doing the 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:09.009
 rolls when it goes by the discharge of 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:12.850
 shadows garlic starts to turn me is 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.390
 it does a lot more damage and then it hurts 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.009
 you will see 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.009
 now let's start 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.460
 but I do not do well 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.460
 what are you doing Spain 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:45.369
 as you see it is going up me of psa 28 31 30 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.990
 it is always kept here 33 32 and 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.840
 here now it starts to go down 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.320
 do not worry now start lowering 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:58.280
 unless 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.280
 30 will stay in 28 24 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:07.600
 this is my normal bps 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.600
 On 28 27 24 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.810
 because this measures psi the good of the 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.909
 sorcerers is that they never spend their sister 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.450
 whenever you spend a little human 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:19.780
 or mushrooms you use the transfusion of life and already 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.780
 is 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.640
 while castillas makes your profile in 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.890
 different things 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.590
 and so could it be an eternity 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:33.520
 because the transfusion of life if I 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.470
 they take away life but I can also cure 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.060
 according to what stands out look at my life now 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.750
 I cured 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.670
 and I'm cured and I'm cured 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.640
 that's why I tell you there may be a 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.850
 eternity that's how good the voices 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.180
 put a lot between all the glued 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:54.260
 and all 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:56.750
 fill is also clear 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.230
 the sorcerers are very good in good areas 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.090
 of jewel 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.420
 to start going down because they only attack 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.420
 to my fish 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.000
 well that in areas also the sorcerer 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.000
 is very good 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:20.450
 now it goes down more 20 325 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:24.040
 but well that's all this is my sorcerer 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:28.090
 flow also commission forgot to say 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.310

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:35.430
 course in kitchen and first aid 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.430
 it's also that I'm here trying 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.270
 trying 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:46.280
 but it's a new fresh rule 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.280
 well I guess in the problem 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.290
