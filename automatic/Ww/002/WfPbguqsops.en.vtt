00:00:03.604 --> 00:00:05.806
The dating game show
where two sexual women

00:00:05.906 --> 00:00:07.574
guess how their
relationship

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:10.477
with three eligible
bachelors might end.

00:00:10.577 --> 00:00:11.845
Let's meet our
contestants.

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:14.047
Amy, tell us a little
bit about yourself.

00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:16.116
Okay, um,
well, I'm a--

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:17.551
I'm 31 years old.

00:00:17.651 --> 00:00:21.088
I'm from Columbus, Ohio.

00:00:21.188 --> 00:00:22.623
And I enjoy repeating
the same mistakes

00:00:22.723 --> 00:00:24.992
over and over again
and never growing.

00:00:25.092 --> 00:00:26.727
Fun.

00:00:26.827 --> 00:00:28.996
Larissa, I understand
you're from Indiana?

00:00:29.096 --> 00:00:31.765
That's right and
romantically, I do have a type

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:34.401
and that's anyone who
reminds me of my dad.

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:36.403
Ho-ho, Papa,
can you hear me?

00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:37.771
(laughing)

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:38.906
Okay, let's play.

00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:40.874
Here's our first
bachelor.

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:42.009
Hi, my name's Brent.

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:43.777
I'm an accountant
from Atlanta.

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:47.214
So Amy, how do you see this
relationship ending?

00:00:47.314 --> 00:00:50.884
Okay, uh, we'll go on
three terrible dates

00:00:50.984 --> 00:00:54.688
and, uh, he'll make me order
appetizers as entrees

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:58.792
and even though I'm mildly
disgusted by him

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:00.961
it'll bother me that I never
hear from him again.

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:02.696
I could believe that.

00:01:02.796 --> 00:01:03.931
Larissa.

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:07.100
Uh, I think we'd probably go
out for about two months.

00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:10.504
And then I would discover that
he writes movie reviews

00:01:10.604 --> 00:01:12.339
for a white
supremacist website.

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.241
Let's see what
Brent has to say.

00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:15.676
My favorite movie
was "Lincoln."

00:01:15.776 --> 00:01:16.844
I thought
Daniel Day-Lewis

00:01:16.944 --> 00:01:18.846
was incredible as
that war criminal.

00:01:18.946 --> 00:01:20.681
Perfect ending.

00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:22.916
Larissa, you're
on the board.
Whoo!

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:24.484
Let's meet our
next bachelor.

00:01:24.585 --> 00:01:25.953
Hey, my name is Ryan.

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:28.322
I'm from the Bronx and
I work at Fill-a-Bear.

00:01:28.422 --> 00:01:30.691
A lot of people mishear
that as Build-a-Bear.

00:01:30.791 --> 00:01:32.526
But Fill-a-Bear
is different.

00:01:32.626 --> 00:01:34.328
See I empty out
old Teddy Bears

00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:37.731
and then I sell the
carcasses to Build-a-Bear.

00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:39.099
Larissa.

00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:41.235
Well, first of all, I will
fall in love with Brent

00:01:41.335 --> 00:01:42.769
because he looks
like my dad,

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.638
uh, which will
cause me to turn

00:01:44.738 --> 00:01:47.774
into a hoarder
like my mother...

00:01:47.875 --> 00:01:49.142
Ten seconds Larissa.

00:01:49.243 --> 00:01:52.546
Oh, uh, and then, uh, we'll
have a huge fight one day

00:01:52.646 --> 00:01:54.147
when he throws out
one of my treasures,

00:01:54.248 --> 00:01:55.716
an umbrella that
says Advil on it

00:01:55.816 --> 00:01:57.351
and then he walks out
of my life forever

00:01:57.451 --> 00:01:58.519
and I call my dad...

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.520
(buzzer)

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:00.621
Amy.

00:02:00.721 --> 00:02:02.823
Okay, after dating
for about six months

00:02:02.923 --> 00:02:04.925
I accidentally
get pregnant

00:02:05.058 --> 00:02:06.860
and even though we're not
really together anymore

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.629
he won't let me
get an abortion?

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:09.630
(bell dinging)

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:10.631
Good answer.

00:02:10.731 --> 00:02:13.267
Well, let's see what
Ryan has to say.

00:02:13.367 --> 00:02:14.735
I would never pay
child support.

00:02:14.835 --> 00:02:16.503
But I'm strongly
pro-life.

00:02:16.603 --> 00:02:17.804
Don't argue with me

00:02:17.905 --> 00:02:19.840
'cause I'm not smart enough
to defend my position.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.175
Yankees rule.

00:02:21.275 --> 00:02:22.309
Amy, you nailed it.

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:23.310
Nice.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.079
Let's check out our
final bachelor.

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:28.115
I work at the
Apple Genius Bar.

00:02:28.215 --> 00:02:30.317
Amy, how do you
see this ending?

00:02:30.417 --> 00:02:33.554
Okay, um, I think I've
got this one, Tom.

00:02:33.654 --> 00:02:35.222
We'll date for
about eight months

00:02:35.322 --> 00:02:37.090
and then I'll open
a folder on his desktop

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:38.392
labeled
football stuff

00:02:38.492 --> 00:02:40.160
and find 400 photos
of Daniel Radcliffe.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.161
(bell dinging)

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:42.162
Amy, I'm gonna stop
you right there.

00:02:42.262 --> 00:02:43.163
You're absolutely right.

00:02:43.263 --> 00:02:44.631
Yes, yes, yes.

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:46.233
It's happened a lot.

00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:48.402
I'm gay.

00:02:48.502 --> 00:02:50.170
Congratulations,
Amy, you win.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.139
Nice!

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:57.477
Join us next week for another
episode of "How..."

00:02:57.578 --> 00:02:59.413
Hey, dad, it's me.

00:03:01.148 --> 00:03:03.617
Well, I lost just like
you said I would.

00:03:06.086 --> 00:03:09.423
Yeah, I can call
you back later.
