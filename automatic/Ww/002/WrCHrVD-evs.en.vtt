would if I did it by hand so I'm going
to<00:00:40.030> show<00:00:40.180> you<00:00:40.239> how<00:00:40.480> to<00:00:40.510> do<00:00:40.660> that<00:00:40.840> now

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
to show you how to do that now

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.119 
to show you how to do that now
so<00:00:43.210> I<00:00:43.239> use<00:00:43.750> word<00:00:44.199> 2007<00:00:44.949> you<00:00:45.879> can<00:00:46.059> use<00:00:46.270> other

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
so I use word 2007 you can use other

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.299 
so I use word 2007 you can use other
word<00:00:48.129> processors<00:00:48.789> but<00:00:50.010> that's<00:00:51.010> what<00:00:51.190> this

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
word processors but that's what this

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.660 
word processors but that's what this
demo<00:00:51.670> is<00:00:51.910> using<00:00:53.309> so<00:00:54.309> here's<00:00:55.269> word<00:00:55.510> 2007<00:00:56.079> and

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
demo is using so here's word 2007 and

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.400 
demo is using so here's word 2007 and
what<00:00:57.670> you<00:00:57.760> want<00:00:57.969> to<00:00:58.000> do<00:00:58.120> first<00:00:58.420> is<00:00:58.690> change<00:00:59.079> the

more<00:01:19.450> paper<00:01:19.720> sizes<00:01:20.020> to<00:01:20.920> put<00:01:21.400> that<00:01:21.520> in<00:01:21.670> and<00:01:22.420> then

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
more paper sizes to put that in and then

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.469 
more paper sizes to put that in and then
now<00:01:23.860> you're<00:01:24.159> left<00:01:24.400> with<00:01:24.759> this<00:01:25.740> portrait

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
now you're left with this portrait

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.719 
now you're left with this portrait
orientation<00:01:28.950> but<00:01:29.950> you<00:01:30.100> probably<00:01:30.400> want

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
orientation but you probably want

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.700 
orientation but you probably want
landscape<00:01:31.360> cyclic<00:01:31.750> orientation<00:01:32.439> to<00:01:32.530> click

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
landscape cyclic orientation to click

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.160 
landscape cyclic orientation to click
landscape<00:01:33.159> and<00:01:34.149> let's<00:01:34.509> zoom<00:01:35.170> out<00:01:35.290> here<00:01:37.170> and

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
landscape and let's zoom out here and

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.560 
landscape and let's zoom out here and
that<00:01:39.009> looks<00:01:40.710> more<00:01:41.710> natural<00:01:41.890> but<00:01:42.820> now<00:01:43.000> if<00:01:43.180> I<00:01:43.299> put

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
that looks more natural but now if I put

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.160 
that looks more natural but now if I put
in<00:01:43.659> some<00:01:43.840> dummy<00:01:44.079> text<00:01:44.200> here<00:01:44.710> and<00:01:45.640> see<00:01:46.360> that<00:01:46.390> it

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
in some dummy text here and see that it

of the card not aligned side because if
the<00:04:48.680> text<00:04:49.039> doesn't<00:04:49.190> line<00:04:49.460> up<00:04:49.490> with<00:04:49.669> these

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
the text doesn't line up with these

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.510 
the text doesn't line up with these
lines<00:04:50.479> and<00:04:50.840> it<00:04:50.900> could<00:04:51.050> look<00:04:51.139> weird<00:04:51.410> I<00:04:51.710> also

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
lines and it could look weird I also

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.900 
lines and it could look weird I also
could<00:04:52.910> have<00:04:53.000> printed<00:04:53.479> double-sided<00:04:54.910> because

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
could have printed double-sided because

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.100 
could have printed double-sided because
in<00:04:56.180> my<00:04:56.360> in<00:04:56.750> my<00:04:56.780> printer<00:04:57.229> settings<00:04:57.970> there's<00:04:58.970> a

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
in my in my printer settings there's a

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.560 
in my in my printer settings there's a
duplex<00:05:00.110> printing<00:05:00.440> option<00:05:01.150> but<00:05:02.150> I<00:05:02.180> decided

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
duplex printing option but I decided

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.969 
duplex printing option but I decided
against<00:05:03.080> it<00:05:03.199> because<00:05:03.259> I<00:05:03.889> was<00:05:04.490> I<00:05:04.789> was<00:05:05.860> doing<00:05:06.860> my

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:06.979 
against it because I was I was doing my

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:08.980 
against it because I was I was doing my
speech<00:05:07.280> and<00:05:07.610> you<00:05:07.669> could<00:05:07.789> see<00:05:08.030> the<00:05:08.330> text<00:05:08.750> on<00:05:08.840> the

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
speech and you could see the text on the

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.089 
speech and you could see the text on the
back<00:05:09.199> it<00:05:09.949> would<00:05:10.250> really<00:05:10.580> make<00:05:11.030> it<00:05:11.300> seem<00:05:12.199> like<00:05:12.860> I

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:13.099 
back it would really make it seem like I

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:16.510 
back it would really make it seem like I
didn't<00:05:13.370> practice<00:05:13.870> and<00:05:14.870> I<00:05:14.960> did<00:05:15.139> I<00:05:15.349> just<00:05:16.160> like

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
didn't practice and I did I just like

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.029 
didn't practice and I did I just like
having<00:05:16.789> my<00:05:17.000> speech<00:05:17.210> with<00:05:17.360> me

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.039 
having my speech with me

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:24.360 
having my speech with me
so<00:05:20.139> that<00:05:21.139> is<00:05:21.949> how<00:05:22.250> you<00:05:22.610> print<00:05:23.330> the<00:05:23.510> note<00:05:23.659> cards

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
so that is how you print the note cards

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:32.199 
so that is how you print the note cards
on<00:05:25.370> the<00:05:25.460> computer<00:05:28.870> wish<00:05:29.870> me<00:05:30.050> luck
