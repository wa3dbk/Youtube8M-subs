00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.860
 It's been all right some cameras from 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.540
 who does not have a pre-configuration that 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.590
 help us a lot and in the moments that 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.180
 We do not want to worry too much about 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.860
 the camera in the camera settings. 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.200
 camera is very easy to use 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.029
 is the basic zone where the basic zone 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.680
 she stays in this sector here where I have 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.150
 various exposure modes 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.220
 the first module of exposure that I 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.600
 show you is the automatic 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.160
 when I put the camera on 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.780
 in this world she will choose all the 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.920
 configurations for me then in a 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.420
 situation that I do not want to be me 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.550
 worrying about the settings may 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.350
 be a good way that happens 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.730
 it will measure the ambient light and will 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.460
 set up if the subject was 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.050
 dying she will accompany this subject 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.790
 it's a separate matter she'll do the 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.410
 focus is that the subject is stopped 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.600
 helps quite another way of 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.640
 Creative zone exposure is the portrait 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.739
 happens in this mode when I 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.969
 I select the camera understands that I 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.520
 I want to bring attention to the subject 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:00.680
 then it will open the precise diaphragm 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.690
 focus the whole background and bring all the attention 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.220
 for this person I 'm photographing 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.530
 one another configuration that happens is good 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.560
 Nice thing she puts the continuous shot 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.390
 so take a photo 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.710
 as long as you do not have your finger triggered 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.510
 it 's cool here 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:19.610
 the next landscape module that happens 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.380
 here in our camera is the 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.119
 camera will close the iris to 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.130
 put the whole landscape focus 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.200
 it will also put the single shot 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.140
 taking a photo at a time 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.000
 okay one other thing she will highlight the tones 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.680
 blues and greens of my scene that are the 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.080
 most common a landscape is the sky by 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.509
 example macro mode that happens in the 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.920
 camera in this mode the camera understands what 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.869
 Are you photographing the small object? 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.340
 then it will open the diaphragm to 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.479
 to sharpen the bottom and bring the 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.340
 attention to that subject that you 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.350
 You are photographing another configuration 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.880
 happens on the camera it raises the 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.619
 flash if she feels that the 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.780
 Your subject matter will help her 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.640
 illuminate your subject and if you like 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.540
 macro you are worth watching the video and 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.640
 objective 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.229
 there we talk about the macro objective 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.259
 that you can get very close to 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.210
 your sport mode subject that happens in 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.320
 the camera when I select this mode to 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.540
 The camera understands that what I am 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.100
 photographing is in motion so she 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.470
 will set a shutter speed 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.110
 faster to freeze that 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.450
 subject but I do not need to use this mode 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.830
 sport just to photograph sports I 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.720
 can I use it to shoot any 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.690
 thing that is in motion then 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.640
 There are children running. 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.080
 Back and forth I want to freeze these 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.210
 children freeze this subject has a 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.830
 photo and select this mode 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.680
 another cool thing to setup 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.840
 this way it puts the focus 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.640
 following the subject then if the subject 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.440
 stir and went front to back 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.300
 she can follow and focus on my 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.520
 I do not miss the photo subject, I'm fine. 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.230
 Nice to wear night portrait 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.300
 This is a really cool way to use me. 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.540
 I select it on some cameras by 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.070
 sector in other cameras at that scn 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.200
 happens on my camera when I 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.310
 I select this mode is the camera going 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.750
 understand that the environment that I am 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.630
 photographing has little light 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.950
 so she is going to make an exhibition 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.080
 by placing a slow shutter where the 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.760
 fragma more open laughter more sensitive 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.470
 to catch that little light that has 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.720
 an environment and it will associate 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.000
 exposure to the flash by giving 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.410
 more natural to my scene another way 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.990
 It's really cool to use the creative. 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.910
 camera happens on the camera 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.380
 the camera gets all automatic it goes 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.540
 resolve all settings for me 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.460
 but they leave none I can 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.960
 choose I want a more focused background 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.570
 a more focused fund 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.270
 want to see just entered the open menu click 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.190
 which is the button here and there on one side 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.200
 to the left I have a more 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.040
 focused and to the right has a background 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.780
 more focused 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.670
 how easy it is to use the basic zone of the 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.520
 your s fall so now experiment 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.780
 use the other landscape portrait modes and 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.160
 if you want to have a little more 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.830
 settings on your camera 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.090
 watch the video about the creative zone 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.090
 beauty to the next staff
