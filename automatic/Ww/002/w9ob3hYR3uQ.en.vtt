higher res I'm going to turn up the

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.810 
higher res I'm going to turn up the
pinch

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:39.450 

not<00:00:29.480> that<00:00:29.750> I<00:00:29.830> may<00:00:30.830> be<00:00:30.890> a<00:00:31.010> little<00:00:31.189> bit<00:00:31.340> less

be kind of savvy with it and it's going

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.619 
be kind of savvy with it and it's going
to<00:00:53.320> make<00:00:53.440> thin<00:00:53.890> marks<00:00:54.460> and<00:00:54.670> thick<00:00:54.910> marks<00:00:55.360> just

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
to make thin marks and thick marks just

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:22.610 
to make thin marks and thick marks just
let<00:00:55.870> it<00:00:55.989> happen<00:00:56.170> it's<00:00:56.589> cool

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.110

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
you one little kind of trick that I like

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.630 
you one little kind of trick that I like
if<00:02:45.650> I<00:02:45.860> go<00:02:46.069> to<00:02:46.129> the<00:02:46.310> standard<00:02:46.730> brush<00:02:48.640> then

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
if I go to the standard brush then

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.770 
if I go to the standard brush then
choose<00:02:50.180> this<00:02:51.080> brush<00:02:51.530> this<00:02:51.950> is<00:02:52.160> my<00:02:52.310> pen<00:02:52.640> brush

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.860 

and<00:02:56.780> if<00:02:57.019> I<00:02:57.110> hold<00:02:57.379> ctrl<00:02:58.010> command<00:02:58.280> I<00:02:58.730> can<00:02:59.510> kind<00:02:59.810> of

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
and if I hold ctrl command I can kind of

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:11.100 
and if I hold ctrl command I can kind of
mask<00:03:00.230> off<00:03:00.610> little<00:03:01.610> tiny<00:03:01.880> areas

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.850 

ok<00:03:11.710> just<00:03:12.070> like<00:03:12.280> that<00:03:12.990> and<00:03:13.990> I<00:03:14.050> can<00:03:14.200> mask<00:03:14.440> off<00:03:14.650> all

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
ok just like that and I can mask off all

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.510 
ok just like that and I can mask off all
the<00:03:14.980> in<00:03:15.100> between<00:03:15.490> areas<00:03:15.700> if<00:03:15.970> I<00:03:16.090> wanted<00:03:16.450> to<00:03:17.520> the

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
the in between areas if I wanted to the

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:27.870 
the in between areas if I wanted to the
next<00:03:18.820> step<00:03:19.030> would<00:03:19.240> be<00:03:19.300> in<00:03:19.690> versing<00:03:20.530> that<00:03:20.680> mask

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.680 

and<00:03:28.000> in<00:03:28.630> those<00:03:28.810> areas<00:03:29.320> I<00:03:30.000> could<00:03:31.000> take<00:03:31.270> a<00:03:31.300> drag

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
and in those areas I could take a drag

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.150 
and in those areas I could take a drag
rectangle<00:03:32.350> with<00:03:32.650> some<00:03:32.950> kind<00:03:33.160> of<00:03:33.250> Oh<00:03:34.980> some<00:03:35.980> kind

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
rectangle with some kind of Oh some kind

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:53.240 
rectangle with some kind of Oh some kind
of<00:03:36.190> pattern<00:03:40.740> take<00:03:41.740> off<00:03:41.920> lazy<00:03:42.160> Mouse<00:03:42.430> of<00:03:42.670> course

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.100 

and<00:03:53.850> maybe<00:03:54.060> not<00:03:54.300> that<00:03:54.330> pattern<00:03:54.900> because

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
and maybe not that pattern because

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.130 
and maybe not that pattern because
that's<00:03:55.290> ugly<00:03:56.450> but<00:03:57.450> I<00:03:57.510> think<00:03:57.720> you<00:03:57.810> get<00:03:57.960> the<00:03:58.020> idea

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
that's ugly but I think you get the idea

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:07.630 
that's ugly but I think you get the idea
you<00:03:58.920> can<00:03:59.070> produce<00:03:59.340> a<00:03:59.580> pattern

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.320 

in<00:04:08.030> just<00:04:08.569> certain<00:04:08.900> little<00:04:09.140> areas<00:04:10.000> now<00:04:11.000> I<00:04:11.030> don't

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
in just certain little areas now I don't

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:12.640 
in just certain little areas now I don't
really<00:04:11.510> want<00:04:11.750> to<00:04:11.780> do<00:04:11.930> that<00:04:11.959> so<00:04:12.290> I<00:04:12.350> don't<00:04:12.530> want

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
really want to do that so I don't want

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.880 
really want to do that so I don't want
to<00:04:12.709> screw<00:04:13.160> this<00:04:13.190> up<00:04:15.459> and<00:04:16.459> it's<00:04:16.730> all<00:04:16.850> about

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
to screw this up and it's all about

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:28.220 
to screw this up and it's all about
subtleties<00:04:20.260> like<00:04:21.260> that<00:04:21.590> that<00:04:21.920> looks<00:04:22.130> nice

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.230 

so<00:04:28.830> that's<00:04:29.010> just<00:04:29.160> in<00:04:29.460> that<00:04:29.610> one<00:04:29.670> little<00:04:29.880> area

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
so that's just in that one little area

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.020 
so that's just in that one little area
now<00:04:30.620> so<00:04:31.620> those<00:04:31.830> are<00:04:31.980> just<00:04:32.040> little<00:04:32.400> tricks<00:04:32.700> I'm

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
now so those are just little tricks I'm

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.520 
now so those are just little tricks I'm
just<00:04:33.240> going<00:04:33.420> to<00:04:33.480> leave<00:04:33.630> it<00:04:33.660> plain<00:04:33.990> because<00:04:34.440> I

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
just going to leave it plain because I

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.950 
just going to leave it plain because I
want<00:04:34.710> to<00:04:34.800> keep<00:04:34.920> it<00:04:35.130> as<00:04:35.400> as<00:04:36.620> easy<00:04:37.620> for<00:04:38.630> you<00:04:39.630> to

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
want to keep it as as easy for you to

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.850 
want to keep it as as easy for you to
mimic<00:04:40.830> and<00:04:41.100> I<00:04:42.090> want<00:04:42.420> you<00:04:42.630> to<00:04:42.750> extrapolate<00:04:43.110> I'm

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
mimic and I want you to extrapolate I'm

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.470 
mimic and I want you to extrapolate I'm
just<00:04:44.100> going<00:04:44.220> to<00:04:44.250> give<00:04:44.400> you<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:44.610> ideas<00:04:45.060> and<00:04:45.090> let

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
just going to give you the ideas and let

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:51.890 
just going to give you the ideas and let
you<00:04:45.600> run<00:04:45.870> with<00:04:45.900> it<00:04:47.690> all<00:04:48.690> right<00:04:49.610> so<00:04:50.720> i'm<00:04:51.720> going

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
you run with it all right so i'm going

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.950 
you run with it all right so i'm going
to<00:04:51.990> say<00:04:52.110> completed<00:04:52.830> and<00:04:53.720> then<00:04:54.720> i'm<00:04:54.810> going<00:04:54.900> to

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
to say completed and then i'm going to

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.660 
to say completed and then i'm going to
say<00:04:55.910> transform<00:04:56.910> clear<00:04:57.900> pivot<00:04:58.320> and<00:04:58.580> put<00:04:59.580> it

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
say transform clear pivot and put it

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:00.890 
say transform clear pivot and put it
together<00:04:59.790> with<00:05:00.000> the<00:05:00.120> other<00:05:00.210> form<00:05:00.630> and<00:05:00.780> see

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
together with the other form and see

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
together with the other form and see
what<00:05:01.050> it<00:05:01.110> looks<00:05:01.230> like<00:05:03.470> that<00:05:04.470> means<00:05:04.650> getting

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:04.920 
what it looks like that means getting

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:10.010 
what it looks like that means getting
out<00:05:05.070> a<00:05:05.100> solo<00:05:05.400> mode<00:05:08.420> so<00:05:09.420> already<00:05:09.780> it<00:05:09.990> looks

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
out a solo mode so already it looks

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.470 
out a solo mode so already it looks
pretty<00:05:10.800> nice<00:05:11.040> the<00:05:11.220> way<00:05:11.340> it<00:05:11.370> is<00:05:14.150> all<00:05:15.150> right<00:05:15.300> so

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:15.480 
pretty nice the way it is all right so

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.390
