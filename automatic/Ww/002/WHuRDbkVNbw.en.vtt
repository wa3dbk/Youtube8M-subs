00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
always going to be the one crossing over

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.119 
always going to be the one crossing over
the<00:00:47.010> front<00:00:47.390> underneath<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.750> over<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.739> then

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
you're just gonna tighten then tried a

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.500 
you're just gonna tighten then tried a
little<00:00:52.140> bit<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:53.219> peace<00:00:53.520> in<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.910> right<00:00:54.120> goes

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
little bit so peace in the right goes

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.790 
little bit so peace in the right goes
over<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.350> front<00:00:55.620> under<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.879> over<00:00:57.750> over<00:00:58.500> the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
front under and over and as you can see

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.490 
front under and over and as you can see
a<00:01:02.129> braid<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.640> already<00:01:03.030> starting<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.570> form<00:01:03.870> so

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
a braid is already starting to form so

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.140 
a braid is already starting to form so
at<00:01:04.619> any<00:01:04.799> point<00:01:04.920> in<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.369> process<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:06.119> can

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
at any point in this process you can

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.940 
at any point in this process you can
just<00:01:06.450> tie<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.720> off<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.229> have<00:01:07.350> fringe<00:01:07.710> hanging

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950
