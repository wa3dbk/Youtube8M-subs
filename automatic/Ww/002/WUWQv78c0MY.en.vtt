black fly rod that Sage has come out
with<00:01:02.760> so<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.870> know<00:01:03.960> it's<00:01:04.170> it's<00:01:04.680> not<00:01:04.979> flashy

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
with so you know it's it's not flashy

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.149 
with so you know it's it's not flashy
yet<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.880> makes<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.210> statement

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
yet it makes a statement

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.289 
yet it makes a statement
the<00:01:08.159> next<00:01:08.399> thing<00:01:08.520> you'll<00:01:08.640> notice<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:09.030> as<00:01:09.179> we

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
the next thing you'll notice is as we

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.200 
the next thing you'll notice is as we
move<00:01:09.630> up<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.960> rod<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.560> new<00:01:10.829> low<00:01:11.310> profile<00:01:11.880> or

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
move up the rod is a new low profile or

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.899 
move up the rod is a new low profile or
slimline<00:01:12.659> ferrule<00:01:13.109> design<00:01:13.520> basically<00:01:14.520> it's<00:01:14.729> a

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
slimline ferrule design basically it's a

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.090 
slimline ferrule design basically it's a
it's<00:01:15.359> a<00:01:15.450> smaller<00:01:15.899> ferrule<00:01:16.380> design<00:01:16.740> that

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
it's a smaller ferrule design that

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.709 
it's a smaller ferrule design that
reduces<00:01:17.579> the<00:01:17.759> weight<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.149> ferrule<00:01:18.479> by<00:01:18.600> as

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:18.719 
reduces the weight of the ferrule by as

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:21.590 
reduces the weight of the ferrule by as
much<00:01:18.869> as<00:01:18.929> 70<00:01:19.409> percent'<00:01:19.909> the<00:01:20.909> technology

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
much as 70 percent' the technology

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.450 
much as 70 percent' the technology
that's<00:01:21.810> used<00:01:22.109> in<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.380> ferrule<00:01:22.710> design<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.310> the

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
that's used in the ferrule design is the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.880 
that's used in the ferrule design is the
same<00:01:23.729> technology<00:01:24.359> used<00:01:24.509> throughout<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.049> rod

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
same technology used throughout the rod

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.010 
same technology used throughout the rod
they<00:01:26.369> call<00:01:26.579> it<00:01:26.670> kinetic<00:01:27.359> technology

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
they call it kinetic technology

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.480 
they call it kinetic technology
basically<00:01:28.439> what<00:01:28.799> they've<00:01:28.950> done<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:29.340> they've

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
basically what they've done is they've

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.239 
basically what they've done is they've
found<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:30.030> way<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.570> pack<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.649> carbon<00:01:32.039> fiber

00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:32.249 
found a way to pack the carbon fiber

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:34.969 
found a way to pack the carbon fiber
molecules<00:01:32.850> more<00:01:33.569> tightly<00:01:33.929> within<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.530> rod<00:01:34.740> or

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
molecules more tightly within the rod or

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.580 
molecules more tightly within the rod or
within<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.310> blank<00:01:35.579> they<00:01:36.270> use<00:01:36.479> less<00:01:36.749> resin<00:01:37.319> and

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
within the blank they use less resin and

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.130 
within the blank they use less resin and
you<00:01:38.520> which<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.759> end<00:01:38.909> up<00:01:39.090> with<00:01:39.240> as<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.420> rod<00:01:39.749> or<00:01:40.109> a

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
rod blank that weighs less that's just

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.660 
rod blank that weighs less that's just
as<00:01:42.479> strong<00:01:42.810> but<00:01:43.560> you're<00:01:43.770> eliminating<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.640> lot

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670

of<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.119> side-to-side<00:01:45.539> wobble<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:46.679> the

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:46.889 
of the side-to-side wobble so the

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:48.590 
of the side-to-side wobble so the
kinetic<00:01:47.340> technology<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.210> same<00:01:48.420> way<00:01:48.569> of

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
kinetic technology is the same way of

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.599 
kinetic technology is the same way of
saying<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.649> we're<00:01:49.799> making<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.189> more<00:01:50.399> accurate

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:50.609 
saying that we're making a more accurate

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:52.550 
saying that we're making a more accurate
fly<00:01:51.030> rod<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.479> doesn't<00:01:51.810> wobble<00:01:51.960> side-to-side

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
fly rod that doesn't wobble side-to-side

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.230 
fly rod that doesn't wobble side-to-side
and<00:01:53.069> and<00:01:53.490> where<00:01:53.639> you<00:01:53.729> notice<00:01:54.090> that

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
and and where you notice that

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.230 
and and where you notice that
side-to-side<00:01:54.659> wobble<00:01:55.409> is<00:01:55.999> when<00:01:56.999> you<00:01:57.090> might

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
side-to-side wobble is when you might

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.059 
side-to-side wobble is when you might
have<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.450> cast<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:58.079> looks<00:01:58.259> great<00:01:58.590> for<00:01:58.950> like

00:01:59.059 --> 00:01:59.069 
have a cast that looks great for like

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:00.800 
have a cast that looks great for like
you<00:01:59.340> know<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.490> first<00:01:59.759> nine<00:02:00.179> tenths<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:00.689> the

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
you know the first nine tenths of the

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.989 
you know the first nine tenths of the
cast<00:02:01.049> but<00:02:01.350> at<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.469> very<00:02:01.679> end<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.130> hooks<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.969> the

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:02.999 
cast but at the very end it hooks to the

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:05.449 
cast but at the very end it hooks to the
left<00:02:03.329> or<00:02:03.630> hooks<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:04.109> the<00:02:04.229> right<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:05.130> what<00:02:05.310> that

00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:05.459 
left or hooks to the right and what that

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:06.980 
left or hooks to the right and what that
is<00:02:05.609> is<00:02:05.819> that's<00:02:05.939> you<00:02:06.509> know<00:02:06.569> as<00:02:06.659> you're<00:02:06.810> working

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
is is that's you know as you're working

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.169 
is is that's you know as you're working
on<00:02:07.319> one<00:02:07.590> play<00:02:07.859> inside<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.490> know<00:02:08.610> back<00:02:08.940> and

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
on one play inside you know back and

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.580 
on one play inside you know back and
forth<00:02:09.390> with<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.660> rod<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.170> rod<00:02:10.200> itself

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
forth with the rod the rod itself

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.520 
forth with the rod the rod itself
wobbles<00:02:11.520> within<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:12.570> plane<00:02:12.960> and<00:02:13.470> that

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
wobbles within that plane and that

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.860 
wobbles within that plane and that
wobbling<00:02:14.190> is<00:02:14.310> transferred

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
wobbling is transferred

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.660 
wobbling is transferred
you're<00:02:15.049> casting<00:02:15.590> into<00:02:15.769> the<00:02:15.860> line<00:02:16.099> and<00:02:16.430> you<00:02:16.489> end

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
you're casting into the line and you end

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.770 
you're casting into the line and you end
up<00:02:16.849> missing<00:02:17.360> your<00:02:17.750> mark<00:02:17.989> so<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:19.489> stage<00:02:19.760> one<00:02:20.120> is

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
up missing your mark so the stage one is

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.479 
up missing your mark so the stage one is
a<00:02:20.840> fly<00:02:21.200> rod<00:02:21.409> that<00:02:21.680> basically<00:02:21.950> is<00:02:22.129> gonna<00:02:22.280> make

that's not going to cause those fish to
spook<00:02:34.370> because<00:02:34.700> you're<00:02:34.819> gonna<00:02:34.909> hit<00:02:35.120> your<00:02:35.329> mark
