of these photos is sitting shoe boxes so

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.470 
of these photos is sitting shoe boxes so
it's<00:00:08.280> really<00:00:08.429> a<00:00:08.550> good<00:00:08.730> idea<00:00:08.790> to<00:00:09.150> be<00:00:09.269> able<00:00:09.420> to

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
it's really a good idea to be able to

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.690 
it's really a good idea to be able to
get<00:00:09.599> them<00:00:09.780> out<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:10.320> use<00:00:11.190> them<00:00:11.400> and<00:00:11.550> share

them with your friends so normally you'd

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.430 
them with your friends so normally you'd
want<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.150> use<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.330> photo<00:00:15.630> scanner<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.230> get<00:00:16.350> the

iphone 4s what I do is I put the the

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.440 
iphone 4s what I do is I put the the
photo<00:00:37.380> near<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.340> light<00:00:38.579> source<00:00:38.850> like<00:00:39.149> this<00:00:39.329> is

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
photo near a light source like this is

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.209 
photo near a light source like this is
near<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.660> window<00:00:39.840> but<00:00:40.230> it's<00:00:40.890> not<00:00:41.040> in<00:00:41.129> direct

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
near a window but it's not in direct

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.670 
near a window but it's not in direct
sunlight<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.879> also<00:00:42.260> will<00:00:43.260> try<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.469> get<00:00:43.559> this

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
sunlight it also will try and get this

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.130 
sunlight it also will try and get this
as<00:00:43.860> square<00:00:44.129> as<00:00:44.160> we<00:00:44.280> possibly<00:00:44.460> can<00:00:44.960> once<00:00:45.960> it

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
as square as we possibly can once it

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.350 
as square as we possibly can once it
square<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:47.160> just<00:00:47.340> snap<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:47.940> just<00:00:48.120> snap

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
square you just snap it and I just snap

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.869 
square you just snap it and I just snap
a<00:00:48.390> few<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:49.160> hopefully<00:00:50.160> one<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.370> those<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.730> going

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
a few so hopefully one of those is going

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.720 
a few so hopefully one of those is going
to<00:00:50.940> be<00:00:51.059> in<00:00:51.180> focus<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.780> look<00:00:52.170> good<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.730> then

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
to be in focus and look good and then

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.580 
to be in focus and look good and then
we'll<00:00:54.449> put<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.690> in<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.840> computer<00:00:57.469> once<00:00:58.469> you've

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
we'll put it in the computer once you've

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.619 
we'll put it in the computer once you've
got<00:00:58.800> your<00:00:58.829> photo<00:00:59.160> in<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.609> computer<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.449> can

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
got your photo in the computer you can

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.689 
got your photo in the computer you can
then<00:01:00.840> manipulate<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:01.949> get<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.309> best<00:01:02.460> out

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
then manipulate it to get the best out

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.549 
then manipulate it to get the best out
of<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.989> obviously<00:01:03.989> you're<00:01:04.110> not<00:01:04.170> going<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.470> be

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
of it obviously you're not going to be

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.830 
of it obviously you're not going to be
able<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.799> do<00:01:04.920> as<00:01:05.070> much<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:06.000> this<00:01:06.180> photo<00:01:06.450> as<00:01:06.689> you

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
able to do as much to this photo as you

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.440 
able to do as much to this photo as you
can<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.860> one<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.400> has<00:01:08.549> been<00:01:08.760> taken<00:01:09.119> directly

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
can to one that has been taken directly

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.740 
can to one that has been taken directly
from<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.750> digital<00:01:10.140> camera<00:01:10.670> but<00:01:11.670> it's<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.659> next

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
from a digital camera but it's the next

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.960 
from a digital camera but it's the next
best<00:01:13.020> thing<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.760> depending<00:01:14.760> on<00:01:14.850> your

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
best thing and depending on your

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.480 
best thing and depending on your
original<00:01:15.479> photo<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:16.710> can<00:01:16.860> probably<00:01:17.130> do<00:01:17.220> quite

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
original photo you can probably do quite

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.090 
original photo you can probably do quite
a<00:01:17.520> lot<00:01:17.610> with<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.680> first<00:01:19.680> thing<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:19.920> probably

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
a lot with it first thing you probably

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.600 
a lot with it first thing you probably
want<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.430> do<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:21.210> crop<00:01:22.009> now<00:01:23.009> that's<00:01:23.220> because

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
want to do is crop now that's because

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.460 
want to do is crop now that's because
when<00:01:24.210> we<00:01:24.330> took<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.659> original<00:01:24.750> photo<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.350> can

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
when we took the original photo you can

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.340 
when we took the original photo you can
see<00:01:25.710> there<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.100> edges<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:27.090> little<00:01:27.840> bit<00:01:28.229> out<00:01:28.320> of

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
see there the edges a little bit out of

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.830 
see there the edges a little bit out of
skew<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:28.979> depends<00:01:29.460> on<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.909> how<00:01:30.570> long<00:01:30.720> you

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
skew and it depends on you how long you

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.679 
skew and it depends on you how long you
take<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.140> set<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:31.920> up<00:01:32.040> but<00:01:32.240> we<00:01:33.240> can<00:01:33.390> fix<00:01:33.540> that

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
take to set it up but we can fix that

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.590 
take to set it up but we can fix that
quite<00:01:34.049> easily<00:01:34.079> in<00:01:34.530> here<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.270> it<00:01:36.270> won't

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
quite easily in here and it won't

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.780 
quite easily in here and it won't
constrain<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.200> way<00:01:37.560> we'll<00:01:37.860> all<00:01:38.100> be<00:01:38.310> able<00:01:38.340> to

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
constrain that way we'll all be able to

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.109 
constrain that way we'll all be able to
follow<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.810> original<00:01:39.900> photo<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.950> bit<00:01:41.939> more

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
follow the original photo a bit more

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.190 
follow the original photo a bit more
closely<00:01:43.460> so<00:01:44.460> do<00:01:44.610> something<00:01:44.850> like<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.509> you

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
closely so do something like that you

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.569 
closely so do something like that you
can<00:01:46.320> see<00:01:46.530> here<00:01:46.770> we're<00:01:46.890> missing<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.250> bit<00:01:47.399> so

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
can see here we're missing a bit so
