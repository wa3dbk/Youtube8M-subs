scalp is something that we are trying to

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.960 
scalp is something that we are trying to
own<00:01:51.990> as<00:01:52.229> Pashu<00:01:52.619> as<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.770> brand<00:01:53.039> we<00:01:53.460> are<00:01:53.490> having<00:01:53.880> it

in most of our cars and this will be a

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:57.919 
in most of our cars and this will be a
precursor<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.819> everything<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.479> happens<00:01:57.780> in

back<00:02:03.569> of<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.990> car<00:02:04.170> done<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:05.099> see<00:02:05.280> this

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
back of the car done and you see this

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.719 
back of the car done and you see this
big<00:02:05.610> band<00:02:05.939> at<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.539> back<00:02:06.689> which<00:02:06.899> is<00:02:07.049> lit<00:02:07.319> up

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
big band at the back which is lit up

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.570 
big band at the back which is lit up
this<00:02:08.729> band<00:02:09.000> for<00:02:09.479> us<00:02:09.630> represents<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.890> connection

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
this band for us represents a connection

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.789 
this band for us represents a connection
to<00:02:11.730> our<00:02:11.760> our<00:02:12.660> past<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.860> 205<00:02:14.579> the<00:02:15.150> 405<00:02:15.690> even<00:02:16.410> oxi

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
to our our past the 205 the 405 even oxi

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.100 
to our our past the 205 the 405 even oxi
up<00:02:16.890> had<00:02:17.579> such<00:02:17.819> a<00:02:17.849> band<00:02:18.120> in<00:02:18.269> the<00:02:18.390> back<00:02:18.540> so<00:02:18.930> this

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
up had such a band in the back so this

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.050 
up had such a band in the back so this
for<00:02:19.319> us<00:02:19.440> is<00:02:19.470> very<00:02:19.590> poor<00:02:19.950> but<00:02:20.340> we've<00:02:20.519> treated<00:02:20.760> it

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
for us is very poor but we've treated it

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.839 
for us is very poor but we've treated it
here<00:02:21.360> in<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:22.079> very<00:02:22.349> very<00:02:22.560> modern<00:02:22.860> almost<00:02:23.670> like

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
here in a very very modern almost like

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.089 
here in a very very modern almost like
an<00:02:24.000> LCD<00:02:24.299> sort<00:02:24.599> of<00:02:24.690> way<00:02:24.810> as<00:02:25.079> a<00:02:25.110> Faton<00:02:25.440> LCD<00:02:25.799> screen

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
an LCD sort of way as a Faton LCD screen

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.660 
an LCD sort of way as a Faton LCD screen
and<00:02:26.280> below<00:02:27.030> it<00:02:27.120> you<00:02:27.239> see<00:02:27.420> this<00:02:27.569> giant<00:02:28.670> diffuser

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
and below it you see this giant diffuser

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.840 
and below it you see this giant diffuser
which<00:02:30.660> is<00:02:31.010> actually<00:02:32.010> very<00:02:32.040> functional<00:02:32.609> it

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
which is actually very functional it

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.720 
which is actually very functional it
sticks<00:02:33.359> the<00:02:33.569> car<00:02:34.019> down<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.739> floor<00:02:35.100> when

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
sticks the car down to the floor when

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.630 
sticks the car down to the floor when
it's<00:02:35.850> doing<00:02:36.390> high<00:02:36.510> speeds

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
it's doing high speeds

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.420 
it's doing high speeds
at<00:02:37.850> the<00:02:38.090> back<00:02:38.300> we<00:02:39.050> have<00:02:39.080> the<00:02:39.350> extractor<00:02:39.920> which

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
at the back we have the extractor which

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.640 
at the back we have the extractor which
extracts<00:02:40.970> all<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:41.720> heat<00:02:41.870> out<00:02:42.050> of<00:02:42.110> the<00:02:42.320> engine

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
extracts all the heat out of the engine

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.260 
extracts all the heat out of the engine
cabin<00:02:42.950> because<00:02:43.700> of<00:02:43.790> course<00:02:44.000> it's<00:02:44.120> a

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
cabin because of course it's a

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.290 
cabin because of course it's a
mid-engine<00:02:45.260> sports<00:02:45.650> car<00:02:45.950> and<00:02:46.490> then<00:02:46.910> Jainism

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
mid-engine sports car and then Jainism

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.250 
mid-engine sports car and then Jainism
in<00:02:47.780> there

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.380 

so<00:02:50.800> the<00:02:50.890> whole<00:02:51.099> concept<00:02:51.640> of<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:51.849> X<00:02:51.940> here<00:02:52.209> has

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
so the whole concept of the X here has

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.009 
so the whole concept of the X here has
been<00:02:52.569> to<00:02:53.290> keep<00:02:54.099> the<00:02:54.129> visual<00:02:55.019> functionality

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
been to keep the visual functionality

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:01.710 
been to keep the visual functionality
alive<00:02:56.610> to<00:02:57.610> work<00:02:57.819> and<00:02:59.700> display<00:03:00.700> I<00:03:00.970> mean<00:03:01.569> to

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
alive to work and display I mean to

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.860 
alive to work and display I mean to
represent<00:03:02.319> visually<00:03:02.910> the<00:03:03.910> design<00:03:04.239> philosophy

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
represent visually the design philosophy

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.809 
represent visually the design philosophy
of<00:03:04.959> per<00:03:05.170> emotion<00:03:05.650> and<00:03:05.800> emotion<00:03:05.950> how<00:03:06.580> we<00:03:06.640> are

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
of per emotion and emotion how we are

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.280 
of per emotion and emotion how we are
showing<00:03:06.880> this<00:03:07.209> here<00:03:07.480> on<00:03:07.630> the<00:03:07.750> exterior<00:03:07.959> again

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
showing this here on the exterior again

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.050 
showing this here on the exterior again
is<00:03:08.410> through<00:03:08.650> the<00:03:08.769> current<00:03:09.069> materials<00:03:09.459> we've

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
is through the current materials we've

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.390 
is through the current materials we've
got<00:03:10.300> copper<00:03:10.660> which<00:03:11.230> talks<00:03:11.980> about<00:03:12.220> the

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
got copper which talks about the

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.180 
got copper which talks about the
emotional<00:03:12.959> part<00:03:13.959> and<00:03:14.140> then<00:03:14.530> we've<00:03:14.709> got<00:03:14.890> carbon

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
emotional part and then we've got carbon

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.890 
emotional part and then we've got carbon
fiber<00:03:15.400> and<00:03:15.700> all<00:03:15.880> the<00:03:16.030> beautiful<00:03:16.239> technical

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
fiber and all the beautiful technical

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.670 
fiber and all the beautiful technical
materials<00:03:17.290> talking<00:03:17.739> about<00:03:17.890> technology<00:03:19.680> so

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
materials talking about technology so

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.880 
materials talking about technology so
this<00:03:21.370> is<00:03:21.580> a<00:03:21.610> supercar<00:03:22.299> so<00:03:22.630> for<00:03:23.140> the<00:03:23.260> interior<00:03:23.709> I

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
this is a supercar so for the interior I

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.309 
this is a supercar so for the interior I
was<00:03:24.190> asked<00:03:24.610> to<00:03:24.849> be<00:03:25.239> to<00:03:25.510> do<00:03:25.630> something<00:03:26.080> very

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
was asked to be to do something very

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.460 
was asked to be to do something very
efficient<00:03:26.980> so<00:03:27.940> I<00:03:28.420> thought<00:03:28.930> about<00:03:29.049> how<00:03:29.319> I<00:03:29.349> could

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
efficient so I thought about how I could

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.280 
efficient so I thought about how I could
do<00:03:29.799> an<00:03:30.400> interior<00:03:30.910> that<00:03:31.150> is<00:03:31.540> very<00:03:31.780> light<00:03:32.019> and

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
do an interior that is very light and

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.550 
do an interior that is very light and
then<00:03:33.130> I<00:03:33.340> thought<00:03:33.640> about<00:03:33.849> an<00:03:34.780> egg<00:03:34.959> box<00:03:35.230> so<00:03:35.440> the

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
then I thought about an egg box so the

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.550 
then I thought about an egg box so the
concept<00:03:35.950> of<00:03:36.040> the<00:03:36.160> interior<00:03:36.610> is<00:03:36.849> an<00:03:37.299> egg<00:03:37.450> box<00:03:37.690> so

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
concept of the interior is an egg box so

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.100 
concept of the interior is an egg box so
it's<00:03:38.829> made<00:03:39.040> out<00:03:39.160> of<00:03:39.220> like<00:03:39.489> a<00:03:39.519> very<00:03:40.209> very

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
it's made out of like a very very

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.949 
it's made out of like a very very
fragile<00:03:42.150> material<00:03:43.150> but<00:03:43.420> the<00:03:43.540> process<00:03:43.930> that

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
fragile material but the process that

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.009 
fragile material but the process that
puts<00:03:44.319> it<00:03:44.530> in<00:03:44.709> shape<00:03:45.010> makes<00:03:45.790> it<00:03:45.970> robust<00:03:46.390> and<00:03:46.690> can

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
puts it in shape makes it robust and can

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:51.900 
puts it in shape makes it robust and can
protect<00:03:48.060> you<00:03:49.060> can<00:03:49.239> protect<00:03:49.660> the<00:03:50.590> occupants<00:03:51.340> of

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
protect you can protect the occupants of

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:52.789 
protect you can protect the occupants of
the<00:03:52.269> car

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
the car

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.099 
the car
the<00:03:53.799> architecture<00:03:54.579> of<00:03:54.760> of<00:03:55.510> the<00:03:55.930> whole

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
the architecture of of the whole

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:59.430 
the architecture of of the whole
interior<00:03:56.620> is<00:03:56.799> very<00:03:57.150> it's<00:03:58.150> very<00:03:58.209> visual<00:03:58.840> we

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
interior is very it's very visual we

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.940 
interior is very it's very visual we
have<00:03:59.620> a<00:03:59.650> small<00:04:00.250> steering<00:04:00.639> wheel<00:04:00.940> and<00:04:01.209> we<00:04:01.299> have

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
have a small steering wheel and we have

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.340 
have a small steering wheel and we have
we<00:04:02.950> have<00:04:02.980> the<00:04:03.310> IP<00:04:03.579> above<00:04:04.299> the<00:04:04.750> steering<00:04:05.170> wheel

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
we have the IP above the steering wheel

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.009 
we have the IP above the steering wheel
and<00:04:05.650> closer<00:04:06.010> to<00:04:06.459> the<00:04:06.670> to<00:04:07.209> the<00:04:07.359> road<00:04:07.540> so<00:04:07.840> the

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
and closer to the to the road so the

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:11.460 
and closer to the to the road so the
architecture<00:04:08.560> of<00:04:09.389> the<00:04:10.389> of<00:04:10.750> the<00:04:10.989> driving

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
architecture of the of the driving

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.099 
architecture of the of the driving
instruments<00:04:12.160> is<00:04:12.670> like<00:04:12.940> the<00:04:13.060> 208<00:04:13.420> and<00:04:13.900> that's

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 
instruments is like the 208 and that's

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:18.029 
instruments is like the 208 and that's
very<00:04:14.380> visual<00:04:14.829> and<00:04:15.930> it's<00:04:16.930> very<00:04:17.169> ergonomic<00:04:17.769> so

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039 
very visual and it's very ergonomic so

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:21.740 
very visual and it's very ergonomic so
the<00:04:19.030> the<00:04:19.870> whole<00:04:20.079> interior<00:04:20.650> is<00:04:20.950> made<00:04:21.340> out<00:04:21.549> of

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
the the whole interior is made out of

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.219 
the the whole interior is made out of
pooling<00:04:22.750> of<00:04:23.020> materials<00:04:23.740> at<00:04:24.400> the<00:04:24.669> right<00:04:25.229> areas

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
pooling of materials at the right areas

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:28.590 
pooling of materials at the right areas
to<00:04:26.590> support<00:04:26.770> the<00:04:27.460> body<00:04:27.669> and<00:04:27.970> to<00:04:28.389> bring

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
to support the body and to bring

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.950 
to support the body and to bring
functions<00:04:29.169> to<00:04:30.160> to<00:04:30.610> to<00:04:30.820> the<00:04:30.970> body<00:04:31.150> the<00:04:31.750> whole

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
functions to to to the body the whole

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.900 
functions to to to the body the whole
interior<00:04:32.289> is<00:04:32.710> made<00:04:33.039> out<00:04:33.220> of<00:04:33.370> one<00:04:33.610> single

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
interior is made out of one single

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.810 
interior is made out of one single
envelope<00:04:34.349> so<00:04:35.349> there<00:04:35.830> is<00:04:35.979> no<00:04:36.160> seats<00:04:36.490> anymore

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
envelope so there is no seats anymore

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.839 
envelope so there is no seats anymore
there<00:04:37.210> is<00:04:37.300> no<00:04:37.510> central<00:04:38.260> console<00:04:38.800> there<00:04:39.610> is<00:04:39.700> no

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:39.849 
there is no central console there is no

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:42.060 
there is no central console there is no
dashboard<00:04:40.479> it's<00:04:40.660> so<00:04:40.870> like<00:04:41.139> one

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
dashboard it's so like one

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.780 
dashboard it's so like one
no<00:04:42.190> no<00:04:42.250> that<00:04:43.180> is<00:04:43.360> a<00:04:43.770> deform<00:04:44.770> to<00:04:44.920> bring<00:04:45.220> function

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
no no that is a deform to bring function

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.060 
no no that is a deform to bring function
so<00:04:46.060> the<00:04:46.330> it's<00:04:46.930> in<00:04:47.320> that<00:04:47.470> sense<00:04:47.800> it's

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
so the it's in that sense it's

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.840 
so the it's in that sense it's
completely<00:04:48.670> new<00:04:49.500> and<00:04:50.500> that's<00:04:50.920> why<00:04:51.160> there<00:04:51.730> are

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
completely new and that's why there are

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.730 
completely new and that's why there are
there<00:04:52.150> are<00:04:52.180> there<00:04:52.390> are<00:04:52.480> no<00:04:52.600> seats<00:04:52.870> coming<00:04:53.500> from

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
there are there are no seats coming from

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.920 
there are there are no seats coming from
the<00:04:53.950> concept<00:04:54.340> of<00:04:54.460> the<00:04:54.520> egg<00:04:54.760> box<00:04:55.060> which<00:04:55.360> is<00:04:55.600> made

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
the concept of the egg box which is made

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:56.610 
the concept of the egg box which is made
out<00:04:56.050> of<00:04:56.080> paper

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
out of paper

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.590 
out of paper
we<00:04:56.950> tried<00:04:57.340> first<00:04:57.670> to<00:04:57.940> think<00:04:58.180> about<00:04:58.420> how<00:04:58.540> we

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
we tried first to think about how we

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.500 
we tried first to think about how we
could<00:04:58.870> made<00:04:59.590> an<00:04:59.740> interior<00:05:00.040> made<00:05:00.430> out<00:05:00.580> only<00:05:01.240> of

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
could made an interior made out only of

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.090 
could made an interior made out only of
paper<00:05:01.810> but<00:05:02.520> after<00:05:03.520> several<00:05:03.790> tries<00:05:04.620> we<00:05:05.620> decided

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
paper but after several tries we decided

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.270 
paper but after several tries we decided
to<00:05:06.310> maybe<00:05:06.940> put<00:05:07.660> something<00:05:07.960> that<00:05:08.440> is<00:05:08.590> more

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
to maybe put something that is more

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.730 
to maybe put something that is more
comfortable<00:05:09.850> comfortable<00:05:10.840> and<00:05:11.140> more<00:05:11.290> durable

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
comfortable comfortable and more durable

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.860 
comfortable comfortable and more durable
for<00:05:11.800> the<00:05:12.070> interior<00:05:12.430> so<00:05:12.760> this<00:05:13.420> whole<00:05:13.630> project

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
for the interior so this whole project

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.000 
for the interior so this whole project
is<00:05:14.230> also<00:05:14.470> about<00:05:15.330> finding<00:05:16.330> new<00:05:16.690> materials<00:05:17.650> on

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
is also about finding new materials on

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.730 
is also about finding new materials on
its<00:05:18.250> materials<00:05:19.080> craftsmanship<00:05:20.080> so<00:05:20.410> that's

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
its materials craftsmanship so that's

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.790 
its materials craftsmanship so that's
why<00:05:20.950> we<00:05:21.100> have<00:05:21.280> the<00:05:21.670> felt<00:05:22.110> we<00:05:23.110> have<00:05:23.230> also<00:05:23.440> a<00:05:23.620> new

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
why we have the felt we have also a new

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.860 
why we have the felt we have also a new
material<00:05:24.280> called<00:05:24.550> the<00:05:24.820> newspaper<00:05:25.360> wood<00:05:25.660> that

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
material called the newspaper wood that

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:01.420 
material was vineyard all the gripping

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.260 
material was vineyard all the gripping
like<00:06:02.020> on<00:06:02.440> the<00:06:02.620> door<00:06:02.890> handle<00:06:03.340> there's<00:06:03.700> a<00:06:03.910> grip

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.270 
like on the door handle there's a grip

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.080 
like on the door handle there's a grip
here<00:06:04.600> on<00:06:05.200> the<00:06:05.410> steering<00:06:05.710> wheel<00:06:05.860> on<00:06:06.640> the<00:06:06.820> crime

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
here on the steering wheel on the crime

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.230 
here on the steering wheel on the crime
control<00:06:07.450> all<00:06:08.410> the<00:06:08.620> grip<00:06:08.890> is<00:06:09.640> made<00:06:10.030> out<00:06:10.210> of

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
control all the grip is made out of

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.260 
control all the grip is made out of
milling<00:06:10.960> path<00:06:11.200> so<00:06:11.620> it<00:06:11.950> shows<00:06:12.250> it<00:06:12.640> shows<00:06:12.760> how

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
milling path so it shows it shows how

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:14.880 
milling path so it shows it shows how
the<00:06:13.330> material<00:06:13.930> is<00:06:14.020> processed<00:06:14.230> we

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:14.890 
the material is processed we

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.070 
the material is processed we
intentionally<00:06:15.520> kept

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 
intentionally kept

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.969 
intentionally kept
the<00:06:17.259> milling<00:06:18.039> path<00:06:18.310> of<00:06:18.610> the<00:06:18.879> of<00:06:19.210> the<00:06:19.419> tool<00:06:19.979> to

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:20.979 
the milling path of the of the tool to

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:25.140 
the milling path of the of the tool to
act<00:06:21.159> as<00:06:21.520> a<00:06:21.580> grip<00:06:22.569> so<00:06:23.250> we<00:06:24.250> have<00:06:24.550> to<00:06:24.849> really

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.150 
act as a grip so we have to really

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.499 
act as a grip so we have to really
orient<00:06:25.780> and<00:06:26.470> mill<00:06:26.800> this<00:06:27.069> part<00:06:27.490> in<00:06:27.789> a<00:06:28.060> way<00:06:28.210> that

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:28.509 
orient and mill this part in a way that

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:31.140 
orient and mill this part in a way that
it<00:06:28.780> will<00:06:28.900> leave<00:06:29.139> some<00:06:29.440> traces<00:06:29.949> that<00:06:30.610> goes<00:06:30.849> with

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:31.150 
it will leave some traces that goes with

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.080 
it will leave some traces that goes with
the<00:06:31.360> lines<00:06:31.720> of<00:06:31.930> the<00:06:32.050> rest<00:06:32.259> of<00:06:32.440> the<00:06:32.530> car<00:06:32.800> and<00:06:33.090> it

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.090 
the lines of the rest of the car and it

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:35.790 
the lines of the rest of the car and it
is<00:06:34.150> also<00:06:34.479> the<00:06:34.780> case<00:06:35.020> on<00:06:35.229> the<00:06:35.319> steering<00:06:35.620> wheel

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 
is also the case on the steering wheel

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.210 
is also the case on the steering wheel
and<00:06:36.190> on<00:06:36.370> the<00:06:36.490> climb<00:06:36.729> control
