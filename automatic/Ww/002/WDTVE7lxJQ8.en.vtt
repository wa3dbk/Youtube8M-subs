00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
hi everybody welcome to the n-channel

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.610 
hi everybody welcome to the n-channel
video<00:00:03.000> blog<00:00:03.300> today<00:00:03.720> what<00:00:03.929> I<00:00:03.959> want<00:00:04.170> to<00:00:04.230> focus<00:00:04.350> on

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
video blog today what I want to focus on

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.140 
video blog today what I want to focus on
is<00:00:04.859> how<00:00:04.980> to<00:00:05.040> use<00:00:05.190> a<00:00:05.220> clamp<00:00:05.460> meter<00:00:05.700> so<00:00:05.879> let's<00:00:06.029> get

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
is how to use a clamp meter so let's get

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.540 
is how to use a clamp meter so let's get
right<00:00:06.299> into<00:00:06.480> this<00:00:06.950> now<00:00:07.950> what<00:00:08.099> a<00:00:08.130> current<00:00:08.460> meter

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
right into this now what a current meter

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.250 
right into this now what a current meter
allows<00:00:08.790> us<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.150> do<00:00:09.300> is<00:00:09.450> to<00:00:09.599> quickly<00:00:09.750> take<00:00:10.230> a

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
allows us to do is to quickly take a

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.629 
allows us to do is to quickly take a
measurement<00:00:10.620> of<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.950> current<00:00:11.219> being<00:00:11.340> induced

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
measurement of the current being induced

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.520 
measurement of the current being induced
through<00:00:11.880> wire<00:00:12.090> and<00:00:12.690> now<00:00:12.840> this<00:00:12.960> is<00:00:13.139> an<00:00:13.230> awesome

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
through wire and now this is an awesome

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.900 
through wire and now this is an awesome
little<00:00:13.559> tool<00:00:13.860> because<00:00:14.190> now<00:00:14.519> you<00:00:14.580> don't<00:00:14.820> have

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
little tool because now you don't have

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.070 
little tool because now you don't have
to<00:00:15.000> break<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.179> circuit<00:00:15.599> in<00:00:15.690> order<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:15.929> take

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
to break the circuit in order to take

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.890 
to break the circuit in order to take
measurements<00:00:17.180> now<00:00:18.180> general<00:00:18.539> there's<00:00:18.720> two

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
measurements now general there's two

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.330 
measurements now general there's two
types<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.289> current<00:00:19.619> meters<00:00:19.830> there's<00:00:20.100> ones

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
types of current meters there's ones

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.920 
types of current meters there's ones
that<00:00:20.490> are<00:00:20.609> just<00:00:20.640> able<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.119> measure<00:00:21.330> AC<00:00:21.570> and

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
that are just able to measure AC and

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.450 
that are just able to measure AC and
there's<00:00:22.380> others<00:00:22.650> that<00:00:22.680> are<00:00:22.890> able<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.220> measure

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
there's others that are able to measure

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.400 
there's others that are able to measure
DC<00:00:23.910> using<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.269> Hall<00:00:24.420> effect<00:00:24.449> now<00:00:25.230> I'm<00:00:25.289> not

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
DC using the Hall effect now I'm not

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.599 
DC using the Hall effect now I'm not
going<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.619> go<00:00:25.710> in<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.890> details<00:00:26.039> of<00:00:26.340> how<00:00:26.460> they

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
going to go in the details of how they

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:27.830 
going to go in the details of how they
work<00:00:26.760> I'm<00:00:26.939> just<00:00:27.000> going<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.330> focus<00:00:27.480> on<00:00:27.689> their

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
work I'm just going to focus on their

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.019 
work I'm just going to focus on their
operational<00:00:28.410> function<00:00:28.800> now<00:00:29.429> traditionally

operational function now traditionally
if<00:00:30.090> you<00:00:30.150> want<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.449> measure<00:00:30.539> current<00:00:30.929> with<00:00:31.019> a

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
if you want to measure current with a

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.990 
if you want to measure current with a
multimeter<00:00:31.619> you<00:00:31.890> just<00:00:32.460> have<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.700> break<00:00:32.850> the

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
multimeter you just have to break the

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.490 
multimeter you just have to break the
circuit<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.420> plug<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.719> into<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.989> corresponds

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
circuit and plug it into the corresponds

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.560 
circuit and plug it into the corresponds
to<00:00:34.950> take<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.280> current<00:00:35.550> measurement<00:00:35.730> where

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
to take the current measurement where

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.209 
to take the current measurement where
when<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:36.870> use<00:00:37.079> something<00:00:37.440> like<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.950> current

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
when you use something like the current

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.860 
when you use something like the current
leader<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.850> can<00:00:38.969> just<00:00:39.149> quickly<00:00:39.360> throw<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.750> on

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
leader you can just quickly throw it on

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.119 
leader you can just quickly throw it on
and<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.140> have<00:00:40.320> your<00:00:40.469> measurement<00:00:40.829> almost

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
and you have your measurement almost

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.920 
and you have your measurement almost
instantaneously<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.360> this<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.750> great

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
instantaneously and this is great

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.600 
instantaneously and this is great
because<00:00:43.200> first<00:00:43.379> off<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.920> main<00:00:44.100> function<00:00:44.520> that

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
because first off the main function that

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.639 
because first off the main function that
place<00:00:44.850> for<00:00:45.030> me<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.300> safety<00:00:45.539> right<00:00:46.260> here<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.469> have

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
place for me is safety right here I have

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.139 
place for me is safety right here I have
a<00:00:46.680> set<00:00:46.890> up<00:00:47.010> for<00:00:47.219> measuring<00:00:47.579> current<00:00:47.789> for<00:00:48.120> a

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
a set up for measuring current for a

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.670 
a set up for measuring current for a
regular<00:00:48.570> multimeter<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.200> as<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.440> can<00:00:49.559> see

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
regular multimeter and as you can see

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.580 
regular multimeter and as you can see
it's<00:00:49.890> not<00:00:50.070> your<00:00:50.250> ideal<00:00:50.579> situation<00:00:51.410> now<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.469> know

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
it's not your ideal situation now I know

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.380 
it's not your ideal situation now I know
there<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:52.949> some<00:00:53.129> client<00:00:53.399> meters<00:00:53.610> where<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.180> is

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
there is some client meters where it is

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.850 
there is some client meters where it is
the<00:00:54.539> multimeter<00:00:54.930> itself<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.620> can<00:00:55.710> take

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
the multimeter itself so you can take

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.740 
the multimeter itself so you can take
current<00:00:56.160> measurements<00:00:56.789> right<00:00:57.180> directly<00:00:57.570> you

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
current measurements right directly you

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.970 
current measurements right directly you
don't<00:00:57.809> have<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.109> worry<00:00:58.199> about<00:00:58.260> conversions<00:00:58.890> or

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
don't have to worry about conversions or

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.799 
don't have to worry about conversions or
anything<00:00:59.129> like<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.399> although<00:01:00.390> they<00:01:00.750> do

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
anything like that although they do

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.420 
anything like that although they do
exist<00:01:01.199> I'm<00:01:01.410> not<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.590> huge<00:01:01.829> fan<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.070> them<00:01:02.309> I

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
exist I'm not a huge fan of them I

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.250 
exist I'm not a huge fan of them I
prefer<00:01:03.030> again<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.480> combination<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:04.080> both

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
prefer again the combination of both

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.630 
prefer again the combination of both
where<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.680> can<00:01:04.799> throw<00:01:04.949> this<00:01:05.070> attachment<00:01:05.339> on

in<00:01:20.580> order<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.850> take<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.030> measurement<00:01:21.270> and

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
in order to take a measurement and

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.660 
in order to take a measurement and
there's<00:01:22.320> some<00:01:22.470> pros<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.710> there's<00:01:23.130> cons<00:01:23.220> to

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
there's some pros and there's cons to

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.179 
there's some pros and there's cons to
this<00:01:23.759> first<00:01:24.420> off<00:01:24.630> highly<00:01:25.320> accurate<00:01:25.500> when

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
this first off highly accurate when

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.440 
this first off highly accurate when
you're<00:01:26.310> using<00:01:26.490> something<00:01:26.820> like<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.360> know

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
you're using something like you know

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.960 
you're using something like you know
your<00:01:27.659> loop<00:01:28.200> 289<00:01:28.560> here<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.100> get<00:01:29.220> monstrous

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
your loop 289 here you get monstrous

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.690 
your loop 289 here you get monstrous
results<00:01:30.509> for<00:01:30.689> accuracy<00:01:31.200> where<00:01:31.950> if<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.310> use

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
results for accuracy where if you use

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.219 
results for accuracy where if you use
something<00:01:32.939> like<00:01:33.090> your<00:01:33.360> current<00:01:33.509> meter<00:01:33.750> the

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
something like your current meter the

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.590 
something like your current meter the
results<00:01:34.619> aren't<00:01:34.920> as<00:01:34.979> accurate<00:01:35.490> now<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.390> also

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
results aren't as accurate now you also

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.210 
results aren't as accurate now you also
get<00:01:36.840> direct<00:01:37.170> readings<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.770> what<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:37.979> mean<00:01:38.159> is

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
get direct readings and what I mean is

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.069 
get direct readings and what I mean is
when<00:01:38.520> you're<00:01:38.640> using<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.939> plant<00:01:39.210> meter<00:01:39.420> you

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
when you're using a plant meter you

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.260 
when you're using a plant meter you
don't<00:01:40.320> have<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.890> direct<00:01:41.310> current<00:01:41.579> reading<00:01:42.000> you

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
don't have a direct current reading you

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.149 
don't have a direct current reading you
get<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.509> translation<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.380> what<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.619> mean<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:44.009> you

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
get a translation and what I mean is you

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.370 
get a translation and what I mean is you
get<00:01:44.399> millivolts<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.180> for<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.049> current<00:01:46.259> meter

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
get millivolts and for the current meter

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.289 
get millivolts and for the current meter
I'm<00:01:46.530> using<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.920> 1<00:01:47.130> millivolt<00:01:47.399> equals<00:01:47.909> 1<00:01:48.090> amp

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
I'm using it 1 millivolt equals 1 amp

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.969 
I'm using it 1 millivolt equals 1 amp
and<00:01:48.750> now<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.259> really<00:01:49.500> nice<00:01:49.649> friendly

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
and now that is a really nice friendly

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.560 
and now that is a really nice friendly
ratio<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.460> work<00:01:50.610> with<00:01:50.820> but<00:01:51.030> not<00:01:51.180> all<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.390> them

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
ratio to work with but not all of them

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.700 
ratio to work with but not all of them
have<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:51.869> ratio<00:01:52.350> next<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.759> cheapness

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
have that ratio next is the cheapness

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.350 
have that ratio next is the cheapness
this<00:01:55.710> is<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.890> pretty<00:01:56.280> decently<00:01:56.729> cheap<00:01:57.030> setup

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
this is a pretty decently cheap setup

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.600 
this is a pretty decently cheap setup
for<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.570> high<00:01:57.689> accuracy<00:01:58.110> but<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.189> problem<00:01:59.520> is

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
for a high accuracy but the problem is

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.819 
for a high accuracy but the problem is
this<00:02:00.060> right<00:02:00.360> here<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:00.750> not<00:02:01.110> cheap<00:02:01.439> so<00:02:01.469> when<00:02:01.740> you

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
this right here is not cheap so when you

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.139 
this right here is not cheap so when you
start<00:02:02.009> adding<00:02:02.280> these<00:02:02.369> features<00:02:02.430> onto<00:02:02.939> your

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
start adding these features onto your

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.530 
start adding these features onto your
multimeter<00:02:03.570> your<00:02:03.869> costs<00:02:04.229> go<00:02:04.290> up<00:02:04.380> massively<00:02:05.159> as

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
multimeter your costs go up massively as

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.310 
multimeter your costs go up massively as
well<00:02:06.540> as<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.899> fact<00:02:07.079> that

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
well as the fact that

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.499 
well as the fact that
multimeters<00:02:08.069> themselves<00:02:08.520> if<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:09.300> start

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
multimeters themselves if you start

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.880 
multimeters themselves if you start
looking<00:02:09.599> at<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.869> cons<00:02:10.080> for<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.379> multimeters

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
looking at the cons for the multimeters

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.430 
looking at the cons for the multimeters
they<00:02:11.340> can't<00:02:11.640> hit<00:02:11.940> high<00:02:12.360> current

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
they can't hit high current

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.350 
they can't hit high current
I<00:02:13.470> mean<00:02:13.680> this<00:02:13.860> multimeter<00:02:14.400> right<00:02:14.580> here<00:02:14.820> has<00:02:15.000> 10

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
I mean this multimeter right here has 10

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.730 
I mean this multimeter right here has 10
amps<00:02:15.660> I<00:02:15.780> mean<00:02:15.930> there's<00:02:16.080> something<00:02:16.320> I<00:02:16.350> can<00:02:16.530> take

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
amps I mean there's something I can take

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.980 
amps I mean there's something I can take
20<00:02:17.190> measurements<00:02:17.520> for<00:02:18.000> let's<00:02:18.210> just<00:02:18.300> say<00:02:18.510> 20

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
20 measurements for let's just say 20

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.140 
20 measurements for let's just say 20
seconds<00:02:19.350> 30<00:02:19.500> seconds<00:02:20.070> and<00:02:20.190> then<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:20.850> have<00:02:21.030> to

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
seconds 30 seconds and then you have to

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.880 
seconds 30 seconds and then you have to
turn<00:02:21.270> them<00:02:21.420> off<00:02:21.600> where<00:02:22.230> this<00:02:22.380> can<00:02:22.620> measure<00:02:22.770> up

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
turn them off where this can measure up

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.220 
turn them off where this can measure up
to<00:02:23.010> 400<00:02:23.670> amps<00:02:23.910> of<00:02:24.000> current<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.450> that's

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
to 400 amps of current and that's

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.840 
to 400 amps of current and that's
continuous<00:02:25.770> operation<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:26.520> you<00:02:26.610> can<00:02:26.730> get

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
continuous operation and you can get

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.810 
continuous operation and you can get
ones<00:02:27.090> I<00:02:27.210> hit<00:02:27.420> up<00:02:27.450> into<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:27.750> thousands<00:02:28.350> and

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
ones I hit up into the thousands and

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.010 
ones I hit up into the thousands and
when<00:02:29.820> you're<00:02:29.940> using<00:02:30.060> your<00:02:30.270> multimeter<00:02:30.720> it's

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
when you're using your multimeter it's

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.200 
when you're using your multimeter it's
not<00:02:31.350> as<00:02:31.560> safe<00:02:31.740> like<00:02:32.370> I<00:02:32.460> stressed<00:02:32.730> before<00:02:32.880> you

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
not as safe like I stressed before you

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.910 
not as safe like I stressed before you
start<00:02:33.480> making<00:02:33.660> little<00:02:33.930> sketchy<00:02:34.290> connections

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
start making little sketchy connections

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.160 
start making little sketchy connections
because<00:02:35.310> there's<00:02:35.610> a<00:02:35.670> log<00:02:35.850> exposed<00:02:36.330> metal<00:02:36.660> and

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
because there's a log exposed metal and

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.480 
because there's a log exposed metal and
I<00:02:37.260> have<00:02:37.410> to<00:02:37.500> protect<00:02:37.740> you<00:02:37.800> from<00:02:37.920> grounds<00:02:38.310> and

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
I have to protect you from grounds and

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.970 
I have to protect you from grounds and
yourself<00:02:38.910> it<00:02:39.060> has<00:02:39.210> a<00:02:39.270> lot<00:02:39.720> of<00:02:39.750> time<00:02:40.050> so<00:02:40.770> when

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
yourself it has a lot of time so when

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.410 
yourself it has a lot of time so when
you're<00:02:41.100> breaking<00:02:41.460> the<00:02:41.550> circuit<00:02:41.880> you<00:02:42.000> have<00:02:42.030> to

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
you're breaking the circuit you have to

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.690 
you're breaking the circuit you have to
look<00:02:42.510> at<00:02:42.660> that<00:02:42.780> as<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:42.930> consequence<00:02:43.490> so<00:02:44.490> now<00:02:44.610> if

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
look at that as a consequence so now if

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.830 
look at that as a consequence so now if
you<00:02:44.820> look<00:02:44.850> at<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.120> sketch<00:02:45.330> for<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.600> clamp

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
you look at the sketch for the clamp

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.390 
you look at the sketch for the clamp
meter<00:02:46.020> you<00:02:46.320> can<00:02:46.350> tell<00:02:46.680> that<00:02:46.830> you<00:02:46.980> don't<00:02:47.190> have

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
meter you can tell that you don't have

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.830 
meter you can tell that you don't have
to<00:02:47.550> break<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.880> circuit<00:02:48.240> and<00:02:48.390> that's<00:02:48.540> a<00:02:48.660> huge

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
to break the circuit and that's a huge

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.840 
to break the circuit and that's a huge
advantage<00:02:48.960> first<00:02:49.710> off<00:02:49.890> speed<00:02:50.370> you<00:02:50.580> just<00:02:50.760> go

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
like that and you're done

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.650 
like that and you're done
next<00:02:52.470> is<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:53.100> fact<00:02:53.310> of<00:02:53.760> safety<00:02:54.150> I<00:02:54.360> can't

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
next is the fact of safety I can't

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.420 
next is the fact of safety I can't
stress<00:02:55.020> that<00:02:55.050> enough<00:02:55.350> safety<00:02:55.920> teams<00:02:56.160> in<00:02:56.310> this

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
stress that enough safety teams in this

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.250 
stress that enough safety teams in this
field<00:02:56.690> electricity<00:02:57.690> that's<00:02:57.780> a<00:02:57.870> potential

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
field electricity that's a potential

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.360 
field electricity that's a potential
killin<00:02:58.560> anytime<00:02:58.920> you're<00:02:59.070> making

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
killin anytime you're making

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.460 
killin anytime you're making
disconnecting<00:03:00.180> you<00:03:00.750> have<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.020> potential<00:03:01.320> to

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
disconnecting you have the potential to

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.550 
disconnecting you have the potential to
cause<00:03:01.950> harm<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.610> you<00:03:02.880> machinery<00:03:03.480> anything<00:03:03.990> so

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
cause harm to you machinery anything so

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.870 
cause harm to you machinery anything so
I<00:03:04.590> find<00:03:04.920> these<00:03:05.040> things<00:03:05.250> a<00:03:05.400> really<00:03:05.700> safe

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
I find these things a really safe

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.600 
I find these things a really safe
operating<00:03:06.510> system<00:03:06.900> next<00:03:07.830> is<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.340> fact<00:03:08.520> that

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
operating system next is the fact that

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.010 
operating system next is the fact that
you<00:03:08.760> can<00:03:08.910> hit<00:03:09.000> those<00:03:09.180> high<00:03:09.330> currents<00:03:09.720> like<00:03:09.900> I

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
you can hit those high currents like I

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.050 
you can hit those high currents like I
said<00:03:10.260> before<00:03:10.410> with<00:03:11.160> this<00:03:11.340> one<00:03:11.610> you<00:03:11.820> can<00:03:11.970> hit

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
said before with this one you can hit

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.550 
said before with this one you can hit
400<00:03:12.600> but<00:03:12.750> there's<00:03:12.900> other<00:03:13.050> models<00:03:13.380> that<00:03:13.470> could

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
400 but there's other models that could

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.430 
400 but there's other models that could
hit<00:03:13.740> 3,000<00:03:14.340> amps<00:03:14.790> no<00:03:15.360> problems<00:03:15.810> so<00:03:16.290> it's

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
hit 3,000 amps no problems so it's

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.900 
hit 3,000 amps no problems so it's
extremely<00:03:16.650> awesome<00:03:17.070> because<00:03:17.400> once<00:03:17.670> again

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
extremely awesome because once again

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.460 
extremely awesome because once again
your<00:03:18.030> typical<00:03:18.209> multimeter<00:03:18.870> can<00:03:19.020> only<00:03:19.140> handle

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
your typical multimeter can only handle

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.640 
your typical multimeter can only handle
about<00:03:19.650> 10<00:03:19.920> amps<00:03:20.250> now<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:20.850> cons<00:03:21.180> not<00:03:22.140> accurate

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
about 10 amps now the cons not accurate

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.860 
about 10 amps now the cons not accurate
these<00:03:23.160> things<00:03:23.489> maybe<00:03:23.820> hit<00:03:24.180> five<00:03:24.480> percent

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
these things maybe hit five percent

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.360 
these things maybe hit five percent
accuracy<00:03:25.200> I<00:03:25.320> mean<00:03:25.650> there's<00:03:25.800> better<00:03:25.950> models

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
accuracy I mean there's better models

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.100 
accuracy I mean there's better models
which<00:03:26.520> can<00:03:26.700> hit<00:03:26.850> that<00:03:26.970> accuracy<00:03:27.510> but<00:03:27.959> then

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
which can hit that accuracy but then

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.770 
which can hit that accuracy but then
your<00:03:28.230> price<00:03:28.470> take<00:03:28.709> goes<00:03:28.890> up<00:03:29.100> monstrously<00:03:29.780> so

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
your price take goes up monstrously so

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.540 
your price take goes up monstrously so
that's<00:03:31.050> the<00:03:31.200> next<00:03:31.380> thing<00:03:31.530> is<00:03:31.770> the<00:03:31.920> cost<00:03:32.160> this

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
that's the next thing is the cost this

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.180 
that's the next thing is the cost this
cost<00:03:33.150> about<00:03:33.390> 400<00:03:34.050> bucks<00:03:34.140> so<00:03:34.800> when<00:03:34.920> you<00:03:34.980> start

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
cost about 400 bucks so when you start

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.770 
cost about 400 bucks so when you start
factoring<00:03:35.400> this<00:03:35.730> into<00:03:36.000> your<00:03:36.090> multimeter<00:03:36.540> what

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
factoring this into your multimeter what

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.360 
factoring this into your multimeter what
you<00:03:36.870> need<00:03:37.020> to<00:03:37.140> you<00:03:37.680> know<00:03:37.800> do<00:03:38.130> all<00:03:38.250> these

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
you need to you know do all these

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.040 
you need to you know do all these
measurements<00:03:38.880> you're<00:03:39.450> going<00:03:39.600> to<00:03:39.690> be<00:03:39.780> really

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
measurements you're going to be really

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.170 
measurements you're going to be really
amplifying<00:03:40.590> what<00:03:40.950> your<00:03:41.160> operational<00:03:41.820> system

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
amplifying what your operational system

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.210 
amplifying what your operational system
costs<00:03:42.630> and<00:03:42.810> there's<00:03:43.380> not<00:03:43.530> a<00:03:43.590> direct<00:03:43.800> reading

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
costs and there's not a direct reading

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.300 
costs and there's not a direct reading
now<00:03:45.030> like<00:03:45.480> I<00:03:45.600> said<00:03:45.660> 1<00:03:46.380> millivolt<00:03:46.650> on<00:03:46.950> this<00:03:47.100> case

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
now like I said 1 millivolt on this case

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.430 
now like I said 1 millivolt on this case
equals<00:03:47.610> 1<00:03:47.790> amp<00:03:48.030> so<00:03:48.570> I<00:03:48.600> know<00:03:48.750> this<00:03:48.989> isn't<00:03:49.290> really

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
equals 1 amp so I know this isn't really

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.259 
equals 1 amp so I know this isn't really
stressing<00:03:50.130> out<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.250> mind<00:03:50.580> but<00:03:50.760> you<00:03:50.850> do<00:03:51.060> have

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
stressing out the mind but you do have

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.270 
stressing out the mind but you do have
to<00:03:51.420> be<00:03:51.540> aware<00:03:51.570> that<00:03:51.810> you<00:03:52.440> do<00:03:52.650> have<00:03:52.860> to<00:03:52.980> do<00:03:53.070> some

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
to be aware that you do have to do some

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.970 
to be aware that you do have to do some
conversions<00:03:54.110> another<00:03:55.110> confer<00:03:55.560> clamp<00:03:55.800> meter

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
conversions another confer clamp meter

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.350 
conversions another confer clamp meter
is<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.400> fact<00:03:56.580> that<00:03:56.640> you<00:03:56.760> need<00:03:56.880> a<00:03:56.940> minimal

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
is the fact that you need a minimal

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.240 
is the fact that you need a minimal
magnetizing<00:03:58.050> current<00:03:58.230> and<00:03:58.739> what<00:03:58.920> I<00:03:58.950> mean<00:03:59.130> is

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
magnetizing current and what I mean is

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.710 
magnetizing current and what I mean is
you<00:03:59.370> need<00:03:59.519> a<00:03:59.670> minimal<00:04:00.180> current<00:04:00.510> flowing

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
you need a minimal current flowing

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.030 
you need a minimal current flowing
through<00:04:00.870> your<00:04:01.019> circuit<00:04:01.410> before<00:04:01.530> justin<00:04:01.920> will

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
through your circuit before justin will

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.800 
through your circuit before justin will
actually<00:04:02.340> pick<00:04:02.489> up<00:04:02.610> a<00:04:02.700> reading<00:04:02.880> now<00:04:03.570> there<00:04:03.720> are

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
actually pick up a reading now there are

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:04.970 
actually pick up a reading now there are
some<00:04:03.900> higher-end<00:04:04.110> ones<00:04:04.470> I<00:04:04.560> can<00:04:04.709> take<00:04:04.860> up

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
some higher-end ones I can take up

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.710 
some higher-end ones I can take up
milliamps<00:04:05.610> and<00:04:05.760> stuff<00:04:05.880> like<00:04:05.970> that<00:04:06.180> but<00:04:06.600> then

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
milliamps and stuff like that but then

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.900 
milliamps and stuff like that but then
your<00:04:06.870> priced<00:04:07.080> it<00:04:07.260> goes<00:04:07.410> up<00:04:07.620> significantly<00:04:08.370> or

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
your priced it goes up significantly or

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.670 
your priced it goes up significantly or
something<00:04:09.209> this<00:04:09.390> you<00:04:09.600> need<00:04:09.750> a<00:04:09.780> minimal<00:04:10.170> 1<00:04:10.440> amp

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680

flowing through your circuit before you

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.500 
flowing through your circuit before you
can<00:04:12.330> register<00:04:12.540> a<00:04:12.810> reading<00:04:13.080> on<00:04:13.170> it<00:04:14.330> now<00:04:15.330> when

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
can register a reading on it now when

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.699 
can register a reading on it now when

you are taking a measurement with the
clamp<00:04:17.070> meter<00:04:17.250> you<00:04:17.730> can't<00:04:17.940> just<00:04:18.090> throw<00:04:18.180> it<00:04:18.269> onto

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
clamp meter you can't just throw it onto

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.279 
the power line you have to find isolated
lines<00:04:20.910> in<00:04:21.090> order<00:04:21.269> to<00:04:21.330> do<00:04:21.479> that<00:04:21.630> and<00:04:21.870> that's

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
lines in order to do that and that's

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:23.510 
lines in order to do that and that's
because<00:04:22.620> there's<00:04:22.860> multiple<00:04:23.039> currents

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
because there's multiple currents

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.680 
because there's multiple currents
running<00:04:23.669> in<00:04:23.820> here<00:04:23.970> they<00:04:24.090> cancel<00:04:24.479> each<00:04:24.570> other

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
running in here they cancel each other

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.120 
running in here they cancel each other
out<00:04:24.840> so<00:04:25.169> it's<00:04:25.590> one<00:04:25.710> of<00:04:25.800> those<00:04:25.860> things<00:04:26.039> they

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
out so it's one of those things they

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.320 
out so it's one of those things they
have<00:04:26.310> to<00:04:26.460> be<00:04:26.550> aware<00:04:26.729> of<00:04:26.789> when<00:04:27.030> you<00:04:27.150> take

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
have to be aware of when you take

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.350 
have to be aware of when you take
measurements<00:04:28.520> now<00:04:29.520> in<00:04:29.639> order<00:04:29.819> to<00:04:29.879> take<00:04:29.939> a<00:04:30.000> DC

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
measurements now in order to take a DC

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.850 
measurements now in order to take a DC
measurement<00:04:30.509> what<00:04:31.050> we're<00:04:31.169> gonna<00:04:31.319> do<00:04:31.439> first<00:04:31.620> is

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
measurement what we're gonna do first is

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.649 
measurement what we're gonna do first is
turn<00:04:32.069> this<00:04:32.189> on<00:04:32.400> then<00:04:33.030> as<00:04:33.150> you<00:04:33.210> can<00:04:33.300> see<00:04:33.360> on<00:04:33.569> the

00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:33.659 
turn this on then as you can see on the

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:35.360 
turn this on then as you can see on the
display<00:04:33.780> screen<00:04:34.050> right<00:04:34.379> here<00:04:34.409> we<00:04:34.860> have<00:04:35.159> a

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
display screen right here we have a

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.369 
display screen right here we have a
negative<00:04:35.639> reading<00:04:36.060> of<00:04:36.240> millivolts<00:04:36.780> so<00:04:37.259> it

00:04:37.369 --> 00:04:37.379 
negative reading of millivolts so it

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:39.110 
negative reading of millivolts so it
just<00:04:37.530> means<00:04:37.680> we<00:04:37.800> have<00:04:37.979> to<00:04:38.129> adjust<00:04:38.490> this<00:04:38.729> until

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
just means we have to adjust this until

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.209 
just means we have to adjust this until
we<00:04:39.210> have<00:04:39.240> a<00:04:39.719> zero<00:04:39.990> reading<00:04:40.409> so<00:04:40.919> this<00:04:41.009> is<00:04:41.159> a

00:04:41.209 --> 00:04:41.219 
we have a zero reading so this is a

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:42.499 
we have a zero reading so this is a
quick<00:04:41.370> little<00:04:41.490> calibration<00:04:42.180> and<00:04:42.330> works

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:42.509 
quick little calibration and works

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:44.390 
quick little calibration and works
fairly<00:04:42.719> well<00:04:42.900> when<00:04:43.650> you<00:04:43.740> get<00:04:43.860> it<00:04:43.949> on<00:04:44.039> to<00:04:44.280> your

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
fairly well when you get it on to your

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.980 
fairly well when you get it on to your
higher<00:04:44.550> accuracy<00:04:44.909> meters<00:04:45.389> there's<00:04:45.659> a<00:04:45.719> lot<00:04:45.900> of

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
higher accuracy meters there's a lot of

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.469 
higher accuracy meters there's a lot of
distortion<00:04:46.259> and<00:04:46.560> this<00:04:47.370> is<00:04:47.520> only<00:04:47.729> for<00:04:48.030> the<00:04:48.120> DC

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
distortion and this is only for the DC

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.230 
distortion and this is only for the DC
as<00:04:48.689> you're<00:04:49.409> only<00:04:49.590> using<00:04:49.800> the<00:04:50.159> holo<00:04:50.370> effect<00:04:50.789> for

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
as you're only using the holo effect for

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.480 
as you're only using the holo effect for
DC<00:04:51.569> measurements<00:04:52.020> and<00:04:52.139> so<00:04:52.919> what<00:04:53.039> I<00:04:53.069> have<00:04:53.280> here

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
DC measurements and so what I have here

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.490 
DC measurements and so what I have here
is<00:04:53.699> the<00:04:53.849> shortened<00:04:54.210> out<00:04:54.300> DC<00:04:54.539> power<00:04:54.930> supply<00:04:55.289> I'm

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
is the shortened out DC power supply I'm

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.740 
is the shortened out DC power supply I'm
going<00:04:56.009> to<00:04:56.069> be<00:04:56.129> running<00:04:56.370> it<00:04:56.460> at<00:04:56.580> 2<00:04:56.759> amps<00:04:57.090> so<00:04:57.240> just

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
going to be running it at 2 amps so just

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:58.879 
going to be running it at 2 amps so just
make<00:04:57.900> sure<00:04:58.050> if<00:04:58.139> you're<00:04:58.229> trying<00:04:58.530> this<00:04:58.680> at<00:04:58.860> home

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
make sure if you're trying this at home

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:00.770 
make sure if you're trying this at home
that<00:04:59.219> you<00:04:59.310> have<00:04:59.370> the<00:04:59.729> voltage<00:04:59.940> dropped<00:05:00.479> way

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
that you have the voltage dropped way

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.209 
that you have the voltage dropped way
down<00:05:00.960> low<00:05:01.169> so<00:05:01.349> you<00:05:01.440> don't<00:05:01.680> blow<00:05:01.860> up<00:05:01.979> anything

00:05:02.209 --> 00:05:02.219 
down low so you don't blow up anything

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:04.550 
down low so you don't blow up anything
so<00:05:03.090> once<00:05:03.330> again<00:05:03.449> we<00:05:03.690> just<00:05:03.840> throw<00:05:03.990> that<00:05:04.169> on<00:05:04.229> and

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
so once again we just throw that on and

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.550 
so once again we just throw that on and
turn<00:05:05.400> it<00:05:05.520> on<00:05:05.639> and<00:05:05.819> as<00:05:06.360> you<00:05:06.389> can<00:05:06.659> see<00:05:06.870> we're

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
turn it on and as you can see we're

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.700 
turn it on and as you can see we're
reading<00:05:08.060> 2<00:05:09.060> millivolts<00:05:09.659> right<00:05:09.810> there<00:05:09.990> so<00:05:10.590> what

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
reading 2 millivolts right there so what

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.170 
reading 2 millivolts right there so what
that<00:05:10.800> means<00:05:11.039> is<00:05:11.250> that<00:05:11.280> there's<00:05:11.639> 2<00:05:11.819> amps<00:05:12.090> of

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
that means is that there's 2 amps of

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.550 
that means is that there's 2 amps of
current<00:05:12.210> flowing<00:05:12.629> and<00:05:12.870> as<00:05:13.050> you<00:05:13.169> can<00:05:13.229> see<00:05:13.289> right

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
current flowing and as you can see right

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.200 
current flowing and as you can see right
there<00:05:13.620> on<00:05:13.770> the<00:05:13.949> panel<00:05:14.250> that's<00:05:14.729> what's<00:05:14.969> going

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
there on the panel that's what's going

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.089 
there on the panel that's what's going
through<00:05:15.240> our<00:05:15.479> circuit<00:05:15.840> now<00:05:16.590> what<00:05:16.710> I<00:05:16.740> have<00:05:16.949> here

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:17.099 
through our circuit now what I have here

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:18.320 
through our circuit now what I have here
is<00:05:17.219> a<00:05:17.250> biscuit<00:05:17.610> joiner<00:05:17.669> and<00:05:17.909> what<00:05:18.090> we're<00:05:18.210> going

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
is a biscuit joiner and what we're going

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.519 
is a biscuit joiner and what we're going
to<00:05:18.360> be<00:05:18.479> doing<00:05:18.599> this<00:05:18.810> morning<00:05:19.169> the<00:05:19.229> current

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:19.529 
to be doing this morning the current

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:21.709 
to be doing this morning the current
flow<00:05:19.680> going<00:05:19.919> into<00:05:20.370> the<00:05:20.759> biscuit<00:05:20.909> joiner<00:05:21.120> so

00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:21.719 
flow going into the biscuit joiner so

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:22.790 
flow going into the biscuit joiner so
we're<00:05:21.810> going<00:05:21.900> to<00:05:21.990> monitor<00:05:22.169> the<00:05:22.349> breakdown

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
we're going to monitor the breakdown

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.860 
we're going to monitor the breakdown
current<00:05:23.190> and<00:05:23.340> all<00:05:23.460> that<00:05:23.639> fun<00:05:23.819> stuff<00:05:23.879> and<00:05:24.629> as

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
current and all that fun stuff and as

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.019 
current and all that fun stuff and as
you<00:05:25.020> can<00:05:25.110> see<00:05:25.259> right<00:05:25.409> here<00:05:25.469> I<00:05:25.860> have<00:05:26.550> this

00:05:27.019 --> 00:05:27.029 
you can see right here I have this

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:29.059 
you can see right here I have this
circuit<00:05:27.509> where<00:05:27.810> I<00:05:27.840> can<00:05:28.199> get<00:05:28.349> into<00:05:28.590> one<00:05:28.800> line

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:29.069 
circuit where I can get into one line

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:31.070 
circuit where I can get into one line
and<00:05:29.310> I'm<00:05:29.729> going<00:05:29.849> to<00:05:29.879> be<00:05:30.000> using<00:05:30.300> my<00:05:30.419> fluke<00:05:30.719> 289

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
and I'm going to be using my fluke 289

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.899 
and I'm going to be using my fluke 289
and<00:05:31.500> I'm<00:05:31.740> going<00:05:31.889> to<00:05:31.949> be<00:05:32.009> using<00:05:32.159> the<00:05:32.370> mid<00:05:32.520> max<00:05:32.729> so

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:32.909 
and I'm going to be using the mid max so

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:43.519 
and I'm going to be using the mid max so
we<00:05:33.000> can<00:05:33.150> see<00:05:33.330> everything

00:05:43.519 --> 00:05:43.529 

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:45.510
