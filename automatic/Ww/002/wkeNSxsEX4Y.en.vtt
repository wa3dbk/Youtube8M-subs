I<00:02:48.120> put<00:02:48.330> that<00:02:48.510> in<00:02:48.920> so<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.040> pretty<00:02:50.220> much<00:02:50.310> tells

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
above the video there and then you can

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.300 
above the video there and then you can
pick<00:02:54.630> whatever<00:02:54.840> font<00:02:55.319> you<00:02:55.560> want<00:02:55.709> the<00:02:55.980> headline
