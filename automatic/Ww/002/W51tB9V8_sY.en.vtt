 bean 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:33.059
 Oh 5 com 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:39.179
 You 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:44.249
 First of all, as for power, 

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:45.390
 Now, to make good players, it can not be the power alone , 

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:51.629
 A lot of help 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:55.799
 But I also helped the family in the moon like the capital 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.100
 With the help of family members and the help of Australian teachers in the beginning 

00:00:55.799 --> 00:01:01.960
 In addition 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:10.750
 Everyone in the channel is not alone in their efforts, 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:11.470
 Because I am really trying to make this one player a success, 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:18.509
 Wan 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:18.509
 Due to the collaboration of the people around you I think those things were also 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:31.540
 To get here doengeot gatguyo Now the juniors 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:35.380
 Now Flavio Tome environment even when I'm there now, frankly, second youngest player in the age 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:43.420
 Rather than too much inde jotahjin environment 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:49.360
 First of all, there are a lot of young players who need to start a 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:53.530
 Play environment training time is no longer a link. 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:56.979
 I usually do a lot of regular openings so that players can 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:01.990
 Person removed 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:03.990
 In that time, I now hold four second split flows are incoming too much 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:09.000
 In short supply 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:12.120
 So let's focus on the players 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:18.420
 So it works, and the two get a lot of that. 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:24.000
 Support the big players are going to be doing a lot of years ago primer also need a lot of career 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:29.730
 And it seems that the players are not 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:33.430
 It is not the person who succeeds a little more effort to take care of these big judeon 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:39.249
 Den Amour d country experience 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:42.480
 I am looking forward to seeing far more goals, 

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:42.480
 I wish I could work hard.
