 covering about 4500 hectares including more than 500 greenhouse

 the first horticultural region in France this represents a pole of around 760 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.620

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.000
 percent after attending this show 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.260
 he continues on everyone 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.940
 the opportunity to meet for now 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.940
 for proof talk about news 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.660
 why why then simply do not want to seize history 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.430
 actually the police 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.610
 in danger or a 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.750
 the French industry that goes through tangier called loire 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.500
 and at the time the great cowboy means of locomotion what is 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.020
 boats and people traveling around the world have brought back plans 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.070
 and they brought back through the law surely 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.670
 angers and the army 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:25.640
 and 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.909
 with the time in mass and angers which became the big center of production 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.880
 horticultural 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.630
 it is a historical phenomenon because it is an absolutely privileged place 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.409
 to rebuild 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.530
 since Tuesday a particularly mild climate with angevin sweetness 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.570
 in terms of safeguarding is quite appropriate to the culture of peace 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.350
 pinewood 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.350
 and then of course an Iberian network with the law reigns 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.410
 the affluence of yesterday particularly suited 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.080
 then to horticulture engineer and trÃ©and 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.270
 who is friendly to horticulture easynet his team a lot of entities 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.950
 who has proven himself on the issue 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.039
 and then and all the ancillary services that have been woven around like schools 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.349
 % and services dhr the necessary funds 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.349
 what makes it so when I was recognized for his ethics 

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:32.029
 when we see that the diversity of all the little ones say that it is 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:33.819
 shrub trees and 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.109
 he articulates the bubbles we have today the biggest names in the 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:40.109
 French nurseries that are installed in the department 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:43.659
 a year ago our days 100 to 500 horticultural companies 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:46.130
 Diageo 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.079
 that go beyond small businesses and big business 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:52.599
 the young are very well distributed at the peak of horticultural production 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.599
 it is a plant nursery with perennial plants 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:04.369
 we manipulate much higher point 

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:08.939
 by allowing developers the seaside resort of watering has one the 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:11.189
 climate issue IT management is at a turning point 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:14.319
 industrialized appearance try to best meet expectations 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.230
 in a world that is more and more uncertain and in particular for 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.159
 nursery 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:27.069
 another major axis of development serenely and try to anticipate 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.999
 the future 

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:29.070
 we can only suffer 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.100
 it means being able to develop concrete solutions of 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.239
 service holiday products both for our business customers 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.239

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:43.460
 beyond its vocation as the flagship of horticulture 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.930
 and the angelic nursery the plant show goes beyond the borders 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.650
 I understood those of the hexagon by displaying a true vocation 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.539
 international 

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:54.579

 e 

00:04:04.529 --> 00:04:06.729

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:09.729
