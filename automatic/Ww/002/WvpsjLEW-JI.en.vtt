00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.740
 in 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.020
 in the galaxy s3 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:30.340
 and well we 're not going to show it before 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:33.840
 what else happens here is we are going to 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.840

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.370

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.530

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.369
 we give him 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.110
 a pretty good enough touch that 's 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.170

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.870

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.810
 if you listen too 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:14.140

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.270
 review the music application 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:30.190
 it really is excellent 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:33.760

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.019
 that makes this good the pressure is not 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.590
 something to whom calm and you touch according to 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:53.370
 a quiet music let's see 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.370

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.650

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.330
 the contacts good if they are the same 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.800

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:44.090

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:47.090
