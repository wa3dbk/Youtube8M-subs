00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 I'm all guys I'm capable of that 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.740
 this new video we're going to see how 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.899
 get some more credit 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.040
 using the sale on the market 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.139
 of the playstation 4 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.849
 the web app as you all know seen 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.830
 that you asked me in so many buy and 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.080
 I really thank you 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.029
 is in maintenance in quotation marks ie in 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.800
 she said just don't do it 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.600
 more use bayern side to these 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.090
 poor idiots that make up the game 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.519
 then we block our service 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.199
 they paid with their beautiful 69 euros 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.300
 and 90 we are going to do 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.790
 buying and selling on the playstation 4 that does 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.670
 really shit since it crashes 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.290
 all a mess a lot of time we leave 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.000
 miss that look at me nasty mon amour 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.379
 the method I propose to you is really 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.149
 a very simple thing consists in 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.480
 when going to the consumables tab e 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.210
 look for the style cards understood must be done 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.489
 when you have few credits for da 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.960
 invest like 12,000 13 thousand or not 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.180
 you can make some purchases 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.010
 thick as style and vi reporters 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.109
 shadow advice because it is the one between the 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.629
 more expensive and bought by everyone 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.460
 although the beneficial effects to me do not 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.409
 are still clear now let's go to 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.159
 see what its price is 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.500
 as you can see flies to 3300 3400 3500 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.650
 in short, it flies at this price so if 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:18.450
 we calculate 5 percent of 3400 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:23.280
 we will come 180 so we must 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.080
 make 3500 or rather 3400 minus 203,000 2 e 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.250
 so you have to buy at a price 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.710
 minor 2002 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.979
 in this case I am 2007 and how 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:36.950
 you can see I bought one at 2005 if 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:39.360
 I put it at 3400 or 3500 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.630
 I will easily manage to sell it and 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.299
 I will make a good profit a discreet trouble 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.579
 Now you have to do is put us here at 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.680
 break our balls because this is a 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.810
 the fuck took us the bayern car 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.479
 so I have to become a dump 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.430
 I recommend living as you can see 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.030
 I always change the price, I promise you 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.860
 2000 and 2007 no worse hicks to wheel for 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.689
 the simple fact that though though 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.369
 location does not actually update a 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.000
 fuck and you have to be careful too 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.110
 because if you do it too many times not 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.280
 you can ask 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.020
 you can even get to ask 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.910
 the captcha code as you can see here 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.130
 I obviously looked for one from 1500 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.830
 because it is not easy to press the keys 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.300
 to perfection and being able to buy it 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.210
 in a nanosecond 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.450
 you have to consider that you are always 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:30.000
 many perched there waiting for 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.310
 take the good cards but trust that 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.800
 it really brings you so much money and there 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.860
 I can absolutely guarantee also 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.420
 when recorded this video because 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.660
 clearly I'm not in live 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:46.290
 I was at a typical time it was 1 PM 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.989
 14 so people were not 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.780
 lots of connected when there are more 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:54.690
 connected persons and it is logical that there 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.640
 are more consumable cards is the medium 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.070
 who live a child to use if 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.690
 you have a 10 and 12 thousand budget this is the 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.209
 second method I want to show you is 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.140
 this is to use and mario gotze 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.640
 that is a player of 10,000 and 12,000 e 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.080
 look for it at a reasonable price like 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.470
 you can see here they are doing a 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.150
 country check manual and I see it flying 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.190
 11,500 by calculating I earn I wanted 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.120
 to do was up to a thousand down for 5 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.190
 one hundred 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.220
 I went to the conclusion I had to 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.950
 buy it at 10,000 you want to see that 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.870
 I'll make 1600 buy players clothes 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.570
 because I did it so fast that 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.430
 after chicago I went on com x prize ie 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.799
 compare price and then see not 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.209
 I get to buy them well they ran away 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.220
 really some even to a 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.549
 price is how you can see this if 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.110
 1800 escaped me and I stayed there 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.239
 really bad because they are so much money and 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.360
 explained could also this 8900 ho 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.590
 made of terror and flees me but they have 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.510
 found so many in succession 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.480
 in fact this 10 thousand and I managed to 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.150
 buy them that i'm a mess they are 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.980
 managed to buy her a few hours in the vito 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.299
 you don't see this 10,000 for example ce 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.190
 I did it quietly I resold 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.430
 to 11 thousand 750 making a total gain 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.630
 of a thousand words 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.549
 then the second proceeding il 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.100
 second method if you have a little more money 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:13.500
 and this is to use players who 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.120
 ranging from a range of credits from 8,000 to 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.890
 11000 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.930
 sometimes it also happens that the accusation tea 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:21.359
 prices for example if I succeeded 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.370
 buy this here at 9100 I did a 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.870
 two thousand earning there was so much stuff 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.360
 well now that you understand the method 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.820
 gone and procreate that I had sold 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.620
 all the shops 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.750
 the video ends here if you have 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.180

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.280

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.400
 who gave us 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.440
 the bayern car that made me make millions 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.000

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.760
