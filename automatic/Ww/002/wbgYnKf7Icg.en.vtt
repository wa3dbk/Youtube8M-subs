by the way Optifine is kind of screwy

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:38.930 
by the way Optifine is kind of screwy
with<00:03:33.810> a<00:03:33.870> FTB<00:03:35.150> but<00:03:36.769> so<00:03:37.769> if<00:03:38.220> you<00:03:38.400> want<00:03:38.579> to<00:03:38.699> install

a jar mod that's like too many items

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.030 
a jar mod that's like too many items
where<00:03:42.959> you<00:03:43.049> drag<00:03:43.199> and<00:03:43.349> drop<00:03:43.470> which<00:03:43.680> I<00:03:43.769> wouldn't

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
where you drag and drop which I wouldn't

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.229 
where you drag and drop which I wouldn't
suggest<00:03:44.129> installing<00:03:44.730> too<00:03:44.970> many<00:03:45.120> items

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
suggest installing too many items

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.150 
suggest installing too many items
because<00:03:45.540> it<00:03:45.660> will<00:03:45.750> screw<00:03:45.930> up<00:03:45.959> not<00:03:46.799> enough

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
because it will screw up not enough

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:53.289 
because it will screw up not enough
items<00:03:47.690> but<00:03:48.690> yeah<00:03:48.840> so<00:03:49.560> I<00:03:50.069> hope<00:03:50.489> this<00:03:51.019> helped<00:03:52.019> and

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299
