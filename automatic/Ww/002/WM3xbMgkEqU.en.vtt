be run harddrive scan required and

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.430 
be run harddrive scan required and
that's<00:00:47.010> gonna<00:00:47.250> block<00:00:47.840> you<00:00:48.840> from<00:00:48.870> running

clicking it until it opens or you make a

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.689 
clicking it until it opens or you make a
little<00:00:58.530> bit<00:00:58.620> easier<00:00:58.949> on<00:00:59.010> yourself

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
little bit easier on yourself

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.250

I<00:01:00.500> completely<00:01:01.500> credit<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.570> silo<00:01:03.570> box<00:01:03.780> for<00:01:04.080> this

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
I completely credit a silo box for this

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.760 
I completely credit a silo box for this
and<00:01:05.450> basically<00:01:06.450> he<00:01:06.720> went<00:01:07.110> ahead<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.500> correct

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
and basically he went ahead and correct

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.649 
and basically he went ahead and correct
the<00:01:08.100> activation<00:01:08.820> code<00:01:08.970> for<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.360> thing<00:01:09.479> so

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
the activation code for this thing so

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.080 
the activation code for this thing so
you<00:01:09.750> can<00:01:09.869> put<00:01:10.049> in<00:01:10.200> anything<00:01:11.130> as<00:01:11.430> email<00:01:12.560> and

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
then paste the activation code it'll be

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.300 
then paste the activation code it'll be
in<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.670> description<00:01:18.799> it'll<00:01:19.799> say<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.159> it's
