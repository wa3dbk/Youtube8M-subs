this is actually a pretty fast you're

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.660 
this is actually a pretty fast you're
not<00:00:09.150> match<00:00:09.420> and<00:00:09.809> you<00:00:10.139> know<00:00:10.230> i<00:00:10.260> managed<00:00:10.559> to

everything<00:00:14.219> so<00:00:14.639> I<00:00:14.670> thought<00:00:15.089> I'd<00:00:15.240> do<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.570> little

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
everything so I thought I'd do a little

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.890 
everything so I thought I'd do a little
quick<00:00:16.020> commentary<00:00:16.980> because<00:00:17.600> that's<00:00:18.600> what<00:00:18.869> I

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
quick commentary because that's what I

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.160 
quick commentary because that's what I
do<00:00:19.020> yeah<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:20.359> so<00:00:21.359> yeah<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.510> pick<00:00:21.720> up<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.930> sniper

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
do yeah and so yeah I pick up the sniper

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.470 
do yeah and so yeah I pick up the sniper
right<00:00:22.410> here<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.830> I<00:00:23.310> want<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:23.880> always<00:00:24.240> try<00:00:24.449> to

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
right here and I want I always try to

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.000 
right here and I want I always try to
keep<00:00:24.689> my<00:00:24.869> distance<00:00:25.050> when<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.590> juggernaut<00:00:25.980> is

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
a bore and they never then they never

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.660 
a bore and they never then they never
get<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.640> score<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.860> and<00:01:22.860> continues<00:01:23.490> like<00:01:23.640> this

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.100 
I think it's time for them to stop
pretend<00:01:26.310> get<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.790> girl<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.330> break<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.840> trend

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110
