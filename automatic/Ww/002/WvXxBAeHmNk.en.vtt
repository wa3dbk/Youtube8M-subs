good gun by the way when everyone gets a
good<00:00:59.920> gun<00:01:00.250> like<00:01:00.580> a<00:01:00.760> ray<00:01:01.059> gun<00:01:01.090> or<00:01:01.750> heavy<00:01:02.620> machine

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
good gun like a ray gun or heavy machine

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.330

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
gun there's this room where the zombies

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.040 
gun there's this room where the zombies
will<00:01:09.369> only<00:01:09.640> approach<00:01:10.360> you<00:01:10.600> from<00:01:10.810> one

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
will only approach you from one

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.440 
will only approach you from one
direction<00:01:11.259> and<00:01:11.860> that's<00:01:12.729> how<00:01:12.850> I<00:01:12.880> got<00:01:13.150> to<00:01:13.300> level

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
direction and that's how I got to level

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.590 
direction and that's how I got to level
100<00:01:13.750> so<00:01:14.229> it's<00:01:14.380> really<00:01:14.560> the<00:01:14.740> best<00:01:14.890> strategy<00:01:15.600> or

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
100 so it's really the best strategy or

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.800 
100 so it's really the best strategy or
playing<00:01:17.050> this<00:01:17.910> which<00:01:18.910> I<00:01:19.060> will<00:01:19.240> show<00:01:19.270> you<00:01:19.509> when

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
playing this which I will show you when

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.520 
playing this which I will show you when
I<00:01:19.840> get<00:01:19.960> a<00:01:20.140> weapon<00:01:20.890> here<00:01:21.310> and<00:01:22.200> enough<00:01:23.200> to<00:01:23.410> open

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
I get a weapon here and enough to open

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:32.950 
I get a weapon here and enough to open
the<00:01:23.770> door

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.870 

I<00:01:33.049> recommend<00:01:34.010> doing<00:01:34.159> this<00:01:34.310> as<00:01:34.520> early<00:01:34.790> as

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
I recommend doing this as early as

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.060 
I recommend doing this as early as
possible<00:01:35.090> once<00:01:36.020> everyone<00:01:36.320> gets<00:01:36.440> a<00:01:36.710> good<00:01:36.830> gun

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
possible once everyone gets a good gun

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.810 
possible once everyone gets a good gun
like<00:01:37.310> a<00:01:37.340> ray<00:01:37.610> gun<00:01:38.229> is<00:01:39.229> the<00:01:40.159> best<00:01:40.400> time<00:01:40.580> to<00:01:40.700> go

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
like a ray gun is the best time to go

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:47.290 
like a ray gun is the best time to go
it's<00:01:41.150> doing<00:01:41.390> possible<00:01:42.729> so
