00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 the theme in the clues the comment is from 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.779
 reginaldo reme and catar that he is 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.700
 two-time world champion because 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.630
 usually works better when you're under 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.730
 pressure 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.769
 just like last year at the time 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.289
 decisive he was better than the rivals 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.810
 and won but if that mark had not 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.420
 suffered the accident of silves that 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.789
 caused two fractures in his leg and left 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.980
 out of seven races the title 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.250
 would hardly be with the hacker and 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.150
 for the many mistakes he made in the year in 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.460
 world formula 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.079
 the accident he killed won was one of 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.040
 most violent in the history of 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.170
 motoring 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.149
 the grass on the shoulder did not reduce 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.000
 the speed of the car that broke in 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.520
 pieces and flipped so many times that the 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.140
 belt did not immobilize the rider inside the 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.780
 survival cell 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.690
 greg monroe was taken care of on the track and who 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.110
 he saw with attention he soon realized that the case 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.030
 it was very serious 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.280
 formula 1 has long recognized the 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.399
 inefficiency of grass in escape areas 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.519
 and began to use gravel today to the gravel 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.110
 already overcome and security technicians 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.540
 study alternatives as a type of 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.000
 asphalt more abrasive than that of the track 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.010
 so the rider has at least the chance 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.270
 of braking mainly at speed 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.119
 ovals 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.850
 grass is the biggest enemy formula 1 if 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.040
 yields to the new champion that formula 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.689
 world has the second fatal accident 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.619
 this season 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.930
 clegg died in one of the most horrible 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:33.479
 accidents in motor racing history 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.880
 on the tenth round of the race in 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.250
 California he lost control of the 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.080
 reigned round and hit the wall of 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.900
 speed protection 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.880
 168 kilometers per hour the scene was so 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.570
 shocking that the American broadcaster 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.940
 the race did not repeat the 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.820
 title of the season conquered by 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:59.600
 juan pablo montoya 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:02.000
 obfuscated by the tragic accident but the 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.880
 car week also lived 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.970
 moments of joy, formula 1 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.840
 he gave mika hackman a very 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.970
 criticized and always far from unanimity 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.020
 the Finnish came to draw attention 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.770
 on tracks at 90 in formula 3 but one 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.410
 shadow 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.700

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.459
 schumacher 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.220
 frustration over defeat and crying 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.950
 began to become a brand. 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.190
 registered it debuted in formula 1 in 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.980
 lock and 91 without much fanfare 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:41.390
 two years later, nor the fact that he was 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.290
 the side of airton sena helped him in 95

 accident in gp australia luck 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.580

 first win in the grand prix of

 mclaren was once again the great team 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.489
 from the 80's 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.700

 schumacher this season some mistakes 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:14.060
 brought the criticism back but the 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.709
 undisputed win in japan and uhf 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.720

 the accident happened on the tenth 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:24.230
 the strongest blow was on this wall of 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.799
 about 365 km per 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.440
 hour 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.870
 Greg ended up dying after an hour 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.329
 and half of the race started in a 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.209
 hospital in the beautiful hill town next to the 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:38.120
 circuit had many internal injuries 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:41.329

 of the year and greg died doing what 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:56.120
 he most liked to occur accelerate now 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.829
 Look at him from the top. 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.319

 below that continue in motoring 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:06.889
 This exciting but risk sport 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.750
 This year's season had ten winners 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:11.480
 different in a considered result 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:14.269

 crown of nations 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:26.900
 the Brazilian highlight was undoubtedly 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:29.360
 christian fittipaldi that even does not 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.979

 winning the championship balance can 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:49.910
 can be seen in the decision between montoya and dario
