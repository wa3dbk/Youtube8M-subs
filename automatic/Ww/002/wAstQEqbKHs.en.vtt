to get out a couple of reviews out there

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.210 
to get out a couple of reviews out there
for<00:00:21.390> you<00:00:21.510> guys<00:00:21.539> so<00:00:21.960> here's<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.710> case<00:00:22.859> itself

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
for you guys so here's the case itself

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.040 
for you guys so here's the case itself
it<00:00:23.670> is<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.850> leather<00:00:24.180> case<00:00:24.420> I'm<00:00:24.689> not<00:00:24.810> exactly

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
it is a leather case I'm not exactly

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.420 
it is a leather case I'm not exactly
sure<00:00:25.230> if<00:00:25.320> it's<00:00:25.560> real<00:00:25.769> leather<00:00:26.010> or<00:00:26.250> faux

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
sure if it's real leather or faux

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.160 
sure if it's real leather or faux
leather<00:00:26.670> but<00:00:26.970> I<00:00:27.240> think<00:00:27.689> when<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:27.900> comes<00:00:27.990> to

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
leather but I think when it comes to

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.330 
leather but I think when it comes to
leather<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.439> only<00:00:28.560> thing<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:28.800> matters<00:00:29.130> is

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
leather the only thing that matters is

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.490 
leather the only thing that matters is
how<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:29.670> looks<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.179> fits<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:30.869> one<00:00:31.019> does

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
how it looks and fits and this one does

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.049 
how it looks and fits and this one does
both<00:00:31.740> pretty<00:00:32.070> well<00:00:32.279> so<00:00:32.520> I'm<00:00:32.610> not<00:00:32.730> really<00:00:32.940> too

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
both pretty well so I'm not really too

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.819 
both pretty well so I'm not really too
concerned<00:00:33.090> about<00:00:33.809> them<00:00:34.050> now<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.620> case

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
concerned about them now the case

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.500 
concerned about them now the case
retails<00:00:35.190> for<00:00:35.250> 30<00:00:35.579> bucks<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.000> it's<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.149> folio

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
retails for 30 bucks and it's a folio

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.569 
retails for 30 bucks and it's a folio
style<00:00:36.570> case<00:00:36.840> as<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.230> can<00:00:37.380> see<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.920> the

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
style case as you can see and the

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.799 
style case as you can see and the
benefit<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.120> that<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.329> that<00:00:39.450> it's<00:00:39.660> very

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
benefit of that is that it's very

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.720 
benefit of that is that it's very
similar<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.379> Valentina's<00:00:40.950> case<00:00:41.160> but<00:00:41.610> it's

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
similar to the Valentina's case but it's

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.490 
similar to the Valentina's case but it's
almost<00:00:41.879> half<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.360> price<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:42.870> there<00:00:43.290> are<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> few

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
almost half the price so there are a few

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.420 
almost half the price so there are a few
differences<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:43.980> I'll<00:00:44.070> point<00:00:44.250> out

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
differences that I'll point out

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.639 
differences that I'll point out
throughout<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.969> overview<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:45.960> here<00:00:46.469> we<00:00:46.559> have

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
throughout the overview so here we have

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.410 
throughout the overview so here we have
the<00:00:46.770> case<00:00:46.920> itself<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:47.850> can<00:00:48.000> see<00:00:48.149> on<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
the case itself you can see on the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.029 
the case itself you can see on the
inside<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.840> have<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.140> hard<00:00:49.379> plastic<00:00:49.890> which

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
inside you have that hard plastic which

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.459 
inside you have that hard plastic which
is<00:00:50.160> very<00:00:50.340> similar<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.809> one<00:00:52.050> on<00:00:52.199> the

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
is very similar to the one on the

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.260 
is very similar to the one on the
valentinus<00:00:53.010> as<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.280> mentioned<00:00:53.640> before<00:00:53.730> except

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
valentinus as I mentioned before except

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.330 
valentinus as I mentioned before except
it's<00:00:54.390> missing<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:55.199> sticker<00:00:55.469> so<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.100> holds

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
it's missing the sticker so that holds

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.770 
it's missing the sticker so that holds
it<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:56.460> place<00:00:56.579> really<00:00:56.940> nicely<00:00:57.180> nice<00:00:57.570> and

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
it in place really nicely nice and

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.510 
it in place really nicely nice and
secure<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:58.320> it's<00:00:58.469> not<00:00:58.559> really<00:00:58.800> going<00:00:58.980> anywhere

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
secure so it's not really going anywhere

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.459 
secure so it's not really going anywhere
you<00:00:59.969> have<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.180> soft<00:01:00.480> suede<00:01:00.719> right<00:01:01.079> here<00:01:01.320> to

and also some tri-di branding on the
back<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.500> can<00:01:13.650> see<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.250> leather<00:01:14.520> material

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
back you can see the leather material

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.719 
back you can see the leather material
that<00:01:16.020> cups<00:01:16.350> up<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.950> front<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.520> got<00:01:17.700> a

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
that cups up to the front and you got a

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.010 
that cups up to the front and you got a
little<00:01:18.000> bit<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.210> cutout<00:01:18.450> for<00:01:18.689> your<00:01:18.810> speaker

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
little bit of a cutout for your speaker

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.170 
little bit of a cutout for your speaker
up<00:01:19.380> there<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.580> main<00:01:20.700> difference<00:01:20.729> between

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
up there so the main difference between

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.910 
up there so the main difference between
this<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.600> Valentinus<00:01:22.229> or<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.439> know<00:01:22.650> the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
this is Valentinus or I know the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.440 
this is Valentinus or I know the
valentinus<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.549> genuine<00:01:24.000> leather<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.360> it

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
valentinus is genuine leather and it

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.270 
valentinus is genuine leather and it
feels<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.750> little<00:01:24.840> bit<00:01:24.990> better<00:01:25.229> but<00:01:25.890> also<00:01:25.950> that

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
feels a little bit better but also that

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.859 
feels a little bit better but also that
this<00:01:26.400> one's<00:01:26.580> just<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.820> more<00:01:27.299> slimmer<00:01:27.630> as<00:01:27.780> you

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
this one's just to more slimmer as you

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.780 
this one's just to more slimmer as you
can<00:01:28.020> see<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:28.500> this<00:01:28.619> one<00:01:28.860> doesn't<00:01:29.310> have<00:01:29.400> as<00:01:29.610> much

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
can see so this one doesn't have as much

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.700 
can see so this one doesn't have as much
leather<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.450> leather<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.810> not<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.200> cushion

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
leather so the leather is not a cushion

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.560 
leather so the leather is not a cushion
on<00:01:31.770> here<00:01:32.070> it's<00:01:32.220> just<00:01:32.280> an<00:01:32.549> addition<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.450> add

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
on here it's just an addition to add

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.050 
on here it's just an addition to add
some<00:01:33.720> rigidity<00:01:33.990> basically<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:35.009> let's<00:01:35.850> pop

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
some rigidity basically so let's pop

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.300 
some rigidity basically so let's pop
this<00:01:36.270> on<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.630> phone<00:01:36.840> very<00:01:37.560> simple<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:37.979> do<00:01:38.070> just

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
this on the phone very simple to do just

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.830 
this on the phone very simple to do just
start<00:01:38.400> off<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.729> volume<00:01:39.030> rocker<00:01:39.210> side<00:01:39.479> and

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
start off to the volume rocker side and

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.690 
start off to the volume rocker side and
get<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.409> installed<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:41.009> can<00:01:41.310> see<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.579> do<00:01:41.670> have

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
get it installed you can see you do have

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.249 
get it installed you can see you do have
that<00:01:41.909> slot<00:01:42.210> for<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.420> credit<00:01:42.600> card<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.229> can

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
that slot for a credit card and you can

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.840 
that slot for a credit card and you can
just<00:01:43.560> pop<00:01:44.040> something<00:01:44.430> in<00:01:44.549> there<00:01:44.700> if<00:01:44.759> you

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
just pop something in there if you

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.969 
just pop something in there if you
wanted<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.720> main<00:01:45.930> difference<00:01:46.320> again<00:01:46.710> is

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
wanted to the main difference again is

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.310 
wanted to the main difference again is
the<00:01:47.159> fact<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.759> one<00:01:48.000> has<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.509> lot<00:01:49.290> of

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
the fact that this one has a lot of

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.960 
the fact that this one has a lot of
slots<00:01:49.680> for<00:01:49.860> credit<00:01:50.220> cards<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.579> this<00:01:50.640> one<00:01:50.820> has

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
slots for credit cards and this one has

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.490 
slots for credit cards and this one has
even<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.360> slot<00:01:51.570> for<00:01:51.600> money<00:01:51.960> whereas<00:01:52.229> this<00:01:52.320> one

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
even a slot for money whereas this one

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.990 
even a slot for money whereas this one
is<00:01:52.590> basically<00:01:52.890> just<00:01:52.979> if<00:01:53.520> you're<00:01:53.700> going<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:53.939> the

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
is basically just if you're going to the

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.550 
is basically just if you're going to the
gym<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.420> can<00:01:54.540> throw<00:01:54.840> your<00:01:54.990> membership<00:01:55.530> card

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
gym you can throw your membership card

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.990 
gym you can throw your membership card
in<00:01:55.890> there<00:01:56.040> maybe<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.280> credit<00:01:56.610> card<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:56.850> that's

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
in there maybe a credit card and that's

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.690 
in there maybe a credit card and that's
about<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:58.229> if<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.409> close<00:01:58.649> this<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.369> main

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
about it so if you close this the main

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.069 
about it so if you close this the main
issue<00:01:59.939> with<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.299> case<00:02:00.479> is<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.719> fact<00:02:00.960> that

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
issue with the case is the fact that

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.260 
issue with the case is the fact that
boom<00:02:01.890> there's<00:02:02.430> nothing<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.820> keep<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.149> secure

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
boom there's nothing to keep it secure

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.420 
boom there's nothing to keep it secure
so<00:02:03.750> this<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.200> gonna<00:02:04.290> be<00:02:04.380> flopping<00:02:04.860> around<00:02:04.979> and

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
so this is gonna be flopping around and

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.730 
so this is gonna be flopping around and
that's<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.850> huge<00:02:06.240> issue<00:02:06.360> for<00:02:06.750> me<00:02:06.930> I<00:02:07.140> wish<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.649> has

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
that's a huge issue for me I wish it has

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.520 
that's a huge issue for me I wish it has
maybe<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.069> magnetic<00:02:08.789> latch<00:02:09.330> on<00:02:09.629> it<00:02:09.660> or<00:02:10.020> just<00:02:10.050> a

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
maybe a magnetic latch on it or just a

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.680 
maybe a magnetic latch on it or just a
snap<00:02:11.160> closure<00:02:11.489> like<00:02:11.790> on<00:02:11.940> here<00:02:12.209> it<00:02:12.360> doesn't

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
snap closure like on here it doesn't

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.370 
snap closure like on here it doesn't
doesn't<00:02:12.959> really

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
doesn't really

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.470 
doesn't really
look<00:02:13.680> great<00:02:14.010> but<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:14.550> does<00:02:14.700> get<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:15.000> job<00:02:15.030> then

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
look great but it does get the job then

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.480 
look great but it does get the job then
and<00:02:15.720> this<00:02:16.050> is<00:02:16.140> just<00:02:16.290> super<00:02:16.500> annoying<00:02:16.890> every

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
and this is just super annoying every

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.130 
and this is just super annoying every
time<00:02:17.670> it<00:02:17.790> just<00:02:17.910> flaps<00:02:18.210> around<00:02:18.540> and<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.930> huge

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
time it just flaps around and the huge

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.960 
time it just flaps around and the huge
fan<00:02:19.380> of<00:02:19.410> that<00:02:19.560> but<00:02:19.890> as<00:02:20.340> I<00:02:20.520> mentioned<00:02:20.640> how<00:02:20.910> the

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
fan of that but as I mentioned how the

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.570 
fan of that but as I mentioned how the
Excel<00:02:21.300> interior<00:02:21.840> very<00:02:22.350> comfortable<00:02:22.950> you<00:02:23.430> can

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
Excel interior very comfortable you can

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.180 
Excel interior very comfortable you can
see<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:24.060> fitment<00:02:24.360> is<00:02:24.720> absolutely<00:02:25.560> fantastic

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
see the fitment is absolutely fantastic

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.860 
see the fitment is absolutely fantastic
so<00:02:26.220> it's<00:02:26.460> not<00:02:26.610> really<00:02:26.790> going<00:02:26.940> anywhere<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:27.600> is

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
so it's not really going anywhere it is

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.930 
so it's not really going anywhere it is
very<00:02:28.290> secure<00:02:28.740> in<00:02:28.890> there<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:29.520> can<00:02:29.670> see<00:02:29.790> the

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
very secure in there you can see the

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.970 
very secure in there you can see the
front<00:02:30.210> has<00:02:30.390> no<00:02:30.630> lay<00:02:30.780> on<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:30.990> table<00:02:31.110> design<00:02:31.320> so

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
front has no lay on the table design so

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.710 
front has no lay on the table design so
if<00:02:32.220> you<00:02:32.580> do<00:02:32.670> drop<00:02:32.970> it<00:02:33.180> you're<00:02:33.360> probably<00:02:33.540> gonna

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
if you do drop it you're probably gonna

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.090 
if you do drop it you're probably gonna
drop<00:02:33.960> it<00:02:34.140> like<00:02:34.230> this<00:02:34.290> but<00:02:34.710> if<00:02:34.800> you're<00:02:34.920> unlucky

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
drop it like this but if you're unlucky

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.880 
drop it like this but if you're unlucky
it<00:02:35.550> will<00:02:35.730> open<00:02:35.910> up<00:02:36.240> and<00:02:36.420> you're<00:02:37.260> gonna<00:02:37.680> get<00:02:37.830> a

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
it will open up and you're gonna get a

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.800 
it will open up and you're gonna get a
cracked<00:02:38.190> screen<00:02:38.520> so<00:02:38.850> that's<00:02:39.210> why<00:02:39.420> I<00:02:39.450> wish<00:02:39.690> I

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
cracked screen so that's why I wish I

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.360 
cracked screen so that's why I wish I
had<00:02:40.020> a<00:02:40.050> sort<00:02:40.350> of<00:02:40.380> snap<00:02:40.680> closure<00:02:40.980> or<00:02:41.130> something

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
had a sort of snap closure or something

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.980 
had a sort of snap closure or something
to<00:02:41.430> keep<00:02:41.520> it<00:02:41.670> shut<00:02:41.880> because<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.780> leather

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
to keep it shut because the leather

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.140 
to keep it shut because the leather
could<00:02:43.230> act<00:02:43.410> as<00:02:43.590> a<00:02:43.680> protection<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.880> screen

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
could act as a protection to the screen

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.600 
could act as a protection to the screen
you<00:02:45.360> can<00:02:46.140> also<00:02:46.320> see<00:02:46.680> on<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.190> right<00:02:47.340> hand<00:02:47.430> side

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
you can also see on the right hand side

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.670 
you can also see on the right hand side
you<00:02:47.700> got<00:02:47.820> access<00:02:47.940> to<00:02:48.210> your<00:02:48.510> power<00:02:48.750> button<00:02:49.020> nice

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
you got access to your power button nice

it's a simple case it's affordable and

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.530 
it's a simple case it's affordable and
it<00:03:35.160> will<00:03:35.370> get<00:03:35.580> the<00:03:35.700> job<00:03:35.910> done<00:03:36.180> so<00:03:36.390> that's

it will get the job done so that's

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.360 
it will get the job done so that's
