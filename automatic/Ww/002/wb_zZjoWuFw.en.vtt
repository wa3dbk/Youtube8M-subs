00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 hello clients in clips on we are not the 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.069
 unique Spanish that we have 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.179
 moved to Las Vegas to this ces 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:12.120
 2015 welcome but it has also come 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.590
 the Spanish bq that as you know not only 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.699
 manufactures smartphones in Europe 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:24.330
 but it also has 3d printing as well 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:26.849
 that we're going to see what beco to transfer the 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.500
 3d printing to 46 countries including the 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.699
 American market in which they are to 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.590
 point to enter and that's why they have 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.190
 moved to here and also to 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.500
 show us a scanner in 3-d this 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.079
 we have here that is called cyclops 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.850
 eye club and that is super simple as 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.950
 you are seeing right now what we have 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.260
 is a platform where we have a 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.270
 figure that we want to replicate in 3-d for 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.860
 we want this, of course, for 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.570
 Then print any object 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.270
 Any object that we want with 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.980
 3d printing this scanner although you can 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.180
 it seems the opposite is super simple 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.480
 what we have are 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:04.360
 the sre is one on each side that they go to 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.910
 mark the figure all those marks the 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.870
 is going to pick up this camera that we have 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.220
 here stuck in that little red piece and 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.830
 then all that anchored with the 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.770
 corresponding screws that go 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.770
 also to this platform that is rotating 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.440
 so you can scan all the 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.750
 Surface of the object we want later 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.670
 print in three dimensions by the way 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.910
 that the red pieces that are here are 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.800
 also printed in 3-d so let's go 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.410
 better impossible a very system 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.300
 simple that is a canopy that is to say 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.460
 that you can assemble yourselves and 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.890
 they promise that it takes only 30 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.190
 minutes to have it ready to be able 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.110
 do it by the way that both the software 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.550
 as the hardware is free with which 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.979
 anyone is a new 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.110
 developer if you for example you are given 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.180
 very well and you can not only 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.670
 modify the platform ie the 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.800
 scanner cycle in 3d but also the 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.509
 software to be able to scan and power 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.460
 do what you hell you want see the 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.850
 laser light beams 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.670
 They alternate between each other and there 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.850
 a small movement of the platform 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.640
 that you can notice so that you can 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.520
 perfectly scan both the 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.530
 depth of the object as well as the 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.209
 height surely there are many you think 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.950
 right now that with 3d printing only 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.140
 you can print objects in a plastic 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.350
 like for example the pele to a plastic 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:32.110
 normal and current like this but is that 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.900
 you can also make prints in 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.510
 a flexible plastic like this the row 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.670
 flex that you see that I'm sinking the 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.350
 face to the doll and can also be 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.440
 do in other fun materials 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.540
 like bamboo wood or almost almost almost 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.790
 any other material that has the 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.830
 ability to be ductile is to say that it 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.420
 threads can do the limit for 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.310
 Practical applications is yours 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.680
 imagination can do any 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.600
 thing from a clip to close the 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.720
 bags of potatoes that is something super 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.459
 practical at home until things very much 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.900
 more complex that combine different 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:10.390
 materials as is articulated hand 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.409
 this scanner shake love cyclops or like 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.209
 what you want to call comes to complement 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:15.280
 the rest of the family products 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.620
 of bq print that is the web box that 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.220
 is a complete printer that is already 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.319
 assembled and is prey and three effects that 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.950
 it is also mounted and that is already 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.879
 available as you see is a little 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.189
 complex a little bit more complex 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:32.200
 ride that the scanner but of course 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:33.790
 it is also very good results 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.280
 well I'll see if with a printer 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.640
 of these I do some slippers like 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.109
 this flexible plastic flex row and 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.409
 I make for example the slippers of 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:45.700
 'back to the future' well what happens is 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:46.989
 I'm a little more complicated 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.150
 fact that they are made alone but the 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.870
 hope never gets lost see you in 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.870
 the next video
