 electronic answering machines and so on 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.329
 these have 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:25.150
 a lot of sensitive semiconductor devices 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.939
 to electrostatic fields 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.590
 that if they become frequent 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.670
 oo considerable 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:33.880
 they would be damaged 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.880
 you will see otellini tibán 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.570
 the cost of laying 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.010
 ground in your current installation 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.010
 equals the cost of a repair a replacement 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.010
 of any of the mentioned devices 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.870
 for the criminal installation to the land 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.190
 fundamental to consider the type of soil 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.380
 where the connection will be made 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.590
 i inserting him 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.530
 elektro 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.610
 since the lower the resistance of the terrain 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.350
 the grounding system 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.350
 will work more efficiently 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.990
 resistivity the ground 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.440
 it increases 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.270
 in direct proportion to the content of rocks 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.360
 and sand 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.860
 Conversely 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.190
 while greater 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.020
 opportunity 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.330
 get the ground 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.630
 this resistance will decrease considerably 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.280
 the average values ​​of resistivity 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.010
 according to the type of soil 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.210
 They are the following 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.560
 for pierre organizes an appointment 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.420
 ten points for my part 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.230
 for earth moisture 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.150
 yes in 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.240
 for dry lands 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.110
 and for rock 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.130
 in conil 700 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.760
 the sandy soil 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.820
 is considered 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.750
 having greater resistivity 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.639
 for not retaining moisture 

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:12.169
 and not present a uniformity for the contact 

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:16.449
 there are different methods for pizzi 

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:17.670
 the resistance of 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.709
 a rock terrain 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.819
 or sand 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.069
 this will be 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.359
 depending on 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:27.359
 type of illegal or there 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.399
 the grounding electrodes 

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:33.849
 They are classified into three types according to the form of their installation 

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:41.029
 horizontal 

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:48.809
 the deep electrodes consisting of using a rod to host web 

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:51.249
 buried the calico min 

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:53.009
 by blows 

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:56.009
 by performing a deep excavation 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.129
 said rod with shame is an inebriated circular bar 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:06.529
 small copper coating of 0 points 25 

00:03:06.529 --> 00:03:08.229
 ministers 

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:12.749
 with a length of 3 meters that is acquired in the vending houses of 

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:14.469
 electric material 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:17.469
 at prices 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:20.579
 If more is required 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.579
 another variable will be used 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.999
 this type of electrodes 

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:32.689
 they are used in places where the soil says wet earth 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:35.010
 an easy country 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.010
 perform an excavation 

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:42.900
 This method is the most recommended for the installations that already exist 

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:46.469
 for being the easiest to make 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.660
 the experts two stowaways such 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:50.609
 with the system 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.159
 in the big-headed cycle 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:53.379
 to discover 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:56.249
 of the same or larger cross section 

00:03:56.249 --> 00:03:58.409
 the ground conductor 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:00.279
 at a depth 

00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:03.319
 50 cent 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:08.369
 and over a length that is calculated based on the resistivity of the ground 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:12.499
 the cti to metro of the conduit 

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:16.069
 the cost of a copper conductor for this type of installation 

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:19.239
 exp similar to the grill 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.110
 this type of facility is recommended in subdivisions 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.479
 uu new constructions 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:29.569
 where is this simple design film 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:32.569
 where will the installation go 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:35.889
 where they exist on the hard 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:37.229
 and extensive 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:39.699
 as roncal 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:42.860
 a real shame 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.340
 would make excavation difficult 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.120
 causing the grill method 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.120
 it was very expensive 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:56.059
 you can also use copper plates 

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:57.330
 in which case 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.939
 the dimensions are determined under similar criteria of resistance 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.770
 and that is what the sheet repeats 

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:13.240
 finally those who cough chemical are those shallow horizontal 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:17.379
 to which the mystery surrounding the elect has been modified 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:19.229
 and they are 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:22.610
 mainly the following 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.629
 carbon 

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:28.649
 where once the good conductor rod has been buried 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:33.830
 It is then covered with mineral coal that is also called 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:34.669
 coke 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:37.669
 the space around the conductive material 

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:41.309
 in order to ensure low resistance 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.740
 another method of using a sudden scraper 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.610
 along the driver's route ovarian 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.210
 said chair 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.629
 has a property that absorbs carbon dioxide water 

00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:58.639
 getting put 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:00.129
 increase contact 

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:01.469
 it was electric 

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:02.740
 getting 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.039
 better drainage of the court 

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:09.249
 it is necessary after its placement 

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:13.259
 saturate with simple water students several days 

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:14.360
 if 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.300
 of not being fed season 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.110
 the third method 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.169
 consists of surrounding the electrode 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:24.629
 counted saline solutions 

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:29.479
 whose reaction with each other will form a stable gelatinous mixture 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:30.389
 which 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:33.150
 is conductive of electricity 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.099
 and insoluble in water 

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:36.629
 and with the great advantage 

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:39.629
 that is absorbed 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.200
 Finally, the 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.210
 trobo was contacted ashore 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.439
 with lightweight synthetic resins 

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:51.550
 this electrolytic type 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.520
 enriching element 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.160
 resulting in a long-acting resistivity straw 

00:06:58.689 --> 00:07:01.830
 the use of sulfates or salts is no longer recommended 

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:03.909
 because it is highly corrosive 

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:06.539
 on the pedals mainly with hard work
