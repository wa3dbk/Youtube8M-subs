yeah<00:04:25.660> that's<00:04:25.870> about<00:04:25.990> it<00:04:26.290> so<00:04:27.090> obviously<00:04:28.090> you

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
yeah that's about it so obviously you

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.000 
yeah that's about it so obviously you
download<00:04:28.690> the<00:04:28.840> app<00:04:28.870> so<00:04:29.470> it<00:04:29.620> doesn't<00:04:29.890> actually

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
download the app so it doesn't actually

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.000 
download the app so it doesn't actually
need<00:04:30.400> to<00:04:30.550> include<00:04:30.820> an<00:04:31.060> app<00:04:31.270> in<00:04:31.480> the<00:04:31.600> box<00:04:32.010> like

need to include an app in the box like

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.640 
need to include an app in the box like
you<00:04:33.760> half<00:04:33.880> expect<00:04:34.300> like<00:04:34.510> but<00:04:34.660> you<00:04:35.050> know<00:04:35.140> half

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
you half expect like but you know half

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.170 
you half expect like but you know half
expect<00:04:36.070> the<00:04:36.160> kinds<00:04:36.400> of<00:04:36.460> people<00:04:36.700> who<00:04:36.850> are<00:04:36.880> like

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
expect the kinds of people who are like

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.580 
expect the kinds of people who are like
you<00:04:37.600> know<00:04:37.690> they<00:04:37.810> want<00:04:37.990> the<00:04:38.080> simplest<00:04:38.320> possible

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
you know they want the simplest possible

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.320 
you know they want the simplest possible
router<00:04:39.010> so<00:04:39.280> something<00:04:39.490> below<00:04:39.760> despite<00:04:40.090> link

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
router so something below despite link

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.810 
router so something below despite link
says<00:04:40.510> don't<00:04:40.690> be<00:04:40.780> like<00:04:40.930> owns<00:04:41.140> it's<00:04:41.770> uh<00:04:42.010> turns

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
says don't be like owns it's uh turns

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.820 
says don't be like owns it's uh turns
with<00:04:42.940> an<00:04:43.060> app<00:04:43.270> for<00:04:43.480> iOS<00:04:43.750> Android<00:04:44.110> on<00:04:44.350> like<00:04:44.590> cat

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
with an app for iOS Android on like cat

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.080 
with an app for iOS Android on like cat
where<00:04:45.580> is<00:04:45.670> it

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
where is it

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.910 
where is it
I'm<00:04:46.870> just<00:04:47.050> kidding<00:04:47.260> what<00:04:47.470> most<00:04:47.650> people

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
I'm just kidding what most people

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.650 
I'm just kidding what most people
probably<00:04:48.010> going<00:04:48.310> to<00:04:48.370> do<00:04:48.460> that<00:04:48.640> I<00:04:48.910> also

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
probably going to do that I also

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.940 
probably going to do that I also
wouldn't<00:04:50.020> really<00:04:50.230> put<00:04:50.440> it<00:04:50.560> past<00:04:50.650> some<00:04:50.920> people

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
wouldn't really put it past some people

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:51.980 
wouldn't really put it past some people
uh<00:04:51.490> ah

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
uh ah

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.260 
uh ah
so<00:04:52.990> I<00:04:53.020> think<00:04:53.260> other<00:04:54.250> than<00:04:54.370> the<00:04:54.490> physical<00:04:55.000> unit

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
so I think other than the physical unit

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.880 
so I think other than the physical unit
this<00:04:55.420> looks<00:04:55.630> pretty<00:04:55.810> much<00:04:55.990> exactly<00:04:56.410> like<00:04:56.650> the

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
this looks pretty much exactly like the

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.620 
this looks pretty much exactly like the
forty<00:04:57.190> two<00:04:57.310> hundred<00:04:57.340> in<00:04:57.790> fact<00:04:58.000> I<00:04:58.390> might

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
forty two hundred in fact I might

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.500 
forty two hundred in fact I might
exactly<00:04:59.669> let's<00:05:00.669> go<00:05:00.910> on<00:05:01.030> a<00:05:01.090> journey<00:05:01.480> of

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
exactly let's go on a journey of

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.750 
exactly let's go on a journey of
discovery<00:05:01.890> find<00:05:02.890> out<00:05:03.040> if<00:05:03.190> it<00:05:03.310> looks<00:05:03.520> exactly

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
discovery find out if it looks exactly

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.550 
discovery find out if it looks exactly
like<00:05:04.300> a<00:05:04.480> forty<00:05:04.780> two<00:05:04.930> hundred<00:05:07.050> okay<00:05:08.080> stepped<00:05:08.440> on

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
like a forty two hundred okay stepped on

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.060 
like a forty two hundred okay stepped on
cat<00:05:08.800> food

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
cat food
