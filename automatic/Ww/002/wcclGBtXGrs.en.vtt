00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.400 
worms well there are a couple of good

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.450 
worms well there are a couple of good
reasons<00:00:43.810> number<00:00:44.810> one<00:00:44.960> what<00:00:45.710> we're<00:00:45.860> doing<00:00:46.220> with

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
reasons number one what we're doing with

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.130 
reasons number one what we're doing with
this<00:00:46.640> system<00:00:46.880> is<00:00:47.270> we're<00:00:47.660> going<00:00:47.780> to<00:00:47.870> be<00:00:47.960> using

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
this system is we're going to be using

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.500 
this system is we're going to be using
all<00:00:48.440> of<00:00:48.470> our<00:00:48.650> kitchen<00:00:48.950> waste<00:00:49.400> and<00:00:49.670> all<00:00:50.270> of

all of our kitchen waste and all of

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.660 
all of our kitchen waste and all of
those<00:00:50.630> kitchen<00:00:51.050> scraps<00:00:51.260> are<00:00:51.530> now<00:00:51.739> no<00:00:52.220> longer

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
those kitchen scraps are now no longer

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.300 
those kitchen scraps are now no longer
in<00:00:52.880> your<00:00:53.120> landfill<00:00:53.720> so<00:00:54.050> it's<00:00:54.200> reducing<00:00:54.739> your

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:55.310 
in your landfill so it's reducing your

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.450 
in your landfill so it's reducing your
total<00:00:55.760> household<00:00:56.480> waste<00:00:56.810> that<00:00:57.649> waste<00:00:58.010> is<00:00:58.280> then

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
total household waste that waste is then

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.479 
total household waste that waste is then
being<00:00:59.000> turned<00:00:59.329> into<00:00:59.660> compost<00:01:00.260> with<00:01:01.250> these

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
being turned into compost with these

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.539 
being turned into compost with these
worms<00:01:01.820> and<00:01:02.149> that<00:01:02.930> compost<00:01:03.590> is<00:01:03.829> really<00:01:04.369> going

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
worms and that compost is really going
