00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
lines instead of five in the Luigi game

lines instead of five in the Luigi game
and<00:00:28.800> you're<00:00:28.949> gonna<00:00:29.300> believe<00:00:30.300> me<00:00:30.980> I'm<00:00:31.980> going<00:00:32.189> to

and you're gonna believe me I'm going to
be<00:00:32.399> doing<00:00:32.579> these<00:00:32.850> in<00:00:33.120> stage<00:00:33.420> order<00:00:33.840> starting

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290

be doing these in stage order starting
with<00:00:34.350> honey<00:00:34.739> hi<00:00:34.920> galaxy<00:00:36.680> like<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.800> said<00:00:37.860> I'm

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
with honey hi galaxy like I said I'm

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.020 
with honey hi galaxy like I said I'm
going<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.430> be<00:00:38.489> editing<00:00:38.879> out<00:00:39.000> all<00:00:39.950> failures

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
going to be editing out all failures

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.280 
going to be editing out all failures
simply<00:00:42.030> because<00:00:42.329> there's<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:42.780> much<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.200> it

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
simply because there's so much of it

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.069 
simply because there's so much of it
that<00:00:43.940> all<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.120> failure<00:00:45.570> will<00:00:45.780> just<00:00:45.930> go

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
that all the failure will just go

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.639 
that all the failure will just go
fiddler<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:48.170> there<00:00:49.170> just<00:00:49.379> really<00:00:49.500> wasn't

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
fiddler and I there just really wasn't

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.220 
fiddler and I there just really wasn't
anything<00:00:50.160> funny<00:00:51.680> about<00:00:53.719> this<00:00:54.719> one<00:00:54.960> probably

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
anything funny about this one probably

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.700 
anything funny about this one probably
be<00:00:55.739> about<00:00:55.890> 10<00:00:56.129> minutes<00:00:56.160> again<00:00:58.010> just<00:00:59.010> because

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
be about 10 minutes again just because

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.299 
be about 10 minutes again just because
he<00:01:01.040> pretty<00:01:01.250> much<00:01:01.399> doesn't<00:01:01.820> let<00:01:02.149> up<00:01:02.329> until<00:01:02.540> very

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
he pretty much doesn't let up until very

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:12.100 
he pretty much doesn't let up until very
end<00:01:05.290> and<00:01:06.400> you'll<00:01:07.400> quickly<00:01:07.610> see<00:01:07.820> why<00:01:08.030> I<00:01:11.110> tried

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
end and you'll quickly see why I tried

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.870 
end and you'll quickly see why I tried
to<00:01:12.140> make<00:01:12.409> a<00:01:12.440> better<00:01:12.650> cut<00:01:12.950> here<00:01:13.250> but<00:01:13.490> I<00:01:13.700> just

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
to make a better cut here but I just

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:21.960 
to make a better cut here but I just
couldn't<00:01:14.300> find<00:01:18.100> one<00:01:19.100> thing<00:01:19.310> that<00:01:19.490> you<00:01:19.899> most

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
couldn't find one thing that you most

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.880 
couldn't find one thing that you most
Randy<00:01:22.970> the<00:01:23.210> lamp<00:01:23.479> started<00:01:23.750> possible<00:01:24.470> really

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
Randy the lamp started possible really

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.570 
Randy the lamp started possible really
let's<00:01:25.040> the<00:01:25.220> only<00:01:25.430> advantage<00:01:26.950> as<00:01:27.950> you<00:01:28.190> can<00:01:28.369> see

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
let's the only advantage as you can see

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.180 
let's the only advantage as you can see
hospital<00:01:29.240> volumes<00:01:30.080> like<00:01:30.259> crazy<00:01:30.590> and<00:01:30.920> it's

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
hospital volumes like crazy and it's

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.250 
hospital volumes like crazy and it's
just<00:01:31.460> about<00:01:31.610> every<00:01:31.880> publication

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
just about every publication

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.340 
just about every publication
I<00:01:34.650> was<00:01:35.160> gonna<00:01:35.400> show<00:01:35.700> all<00:01:35.940> the<00:01:36.390> shortcut<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.320> the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
I was gonna show all the shortcut to the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.050 
I was gonna show all the shortcut to the
stage<00:01:37.740> but<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.750> could<00:01:39.750> pull<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.020> off<00:01:40.940> this<00:01:41.940> is

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
stage but I could pull it off this is

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:52.700 
stage but I could pull it off this is
why<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.240> wish<00:01:50.630> to<00:01:51.630> land<00:01:51.900> to<00:01:52.050> this<00:01:52.200> honey<00:01:52.470> and

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
why I wish to land to this honey and

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.620 
why I wish to land to this honey and
jump<00:01:53.040> around<00:01:53.190> for<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.550> while<00:01:53.670> this<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.240> where

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
jump around for a while this is where

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.140 
jump around for a while this is where
you<00:01:54.780> overtake<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.260> quickly<00:01:55.770> if<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.760> get<00:01:56.910> stuck

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
you overtake it quickly if you get stuck

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.850 
you overtake it quickly if you get stuck
there<00:01:57.300> twice<00:01:57.570> this<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:58.020> probably<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.440> easier

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
there twice this is probably the easier

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.860 
there twice this is probably the easier
than<00:01:59.250> cosmically<00:01:59.790> degrees<00:02:00.300> is<00:02:00.480> simply

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
than cosmically degrees is simply

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.020 
than cosmically degrees is simply
because<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.380> back

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
because of that back

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.130 
because of that back
now<00:02:03.600> rather<00:02:04.229> than<00:02:04.470> show<00:02:05.100> failures<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:06.270> do<00:02:06.750> have

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
now rather than show failures I do have

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.130 
now rather than show failures I do have
something<00:02:07.440> else<00:02:07.740> planned

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.990 

and<00:02:10.770> you'll<00:02:11.100> see<00:02:12.680> shortly<00:02:13.680> what<00:02:14.310> I'm<00:02:14.490> gonna<00:02:14.670> do

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
is I'm going to show the cosmic Luigi

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.960 
is I'm going to show the cosmic Luigi
rates<00:02:18.450> again<00:02:19.160> but<00:02:20.160> i'm<00:02:20.400> going<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.730> show<00:02:20.940> you

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
rates again but i'm going to show you

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.660 
rates again but i'm going to show you
what<00:02:21.930> it<00:02:22.050> looks<00:02:22.080> like<00:02:22.410> side<00:02:22.770> by<00:02:22.800> side<00:02:23.250> with<00:02:23.550> the

what it looks like side by side with the

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.330 
what it looks like side by side with the
cosmic<00:02:24.090> mario<00:02:24.390> race<00:02:27.530> okay<00:02:28.530> quiet<00:02:28.860> for<00:02:29.160> this

cosmic mario race okay quiet for this

00:02:29.340 --> 00:03:20.940 
cosmic mario race okay quiet for this
because<00:02:30.120> this<00:02:30.390> should<00:02:30.630> speak<00:02:30.870> brazil

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950

so you guys now you can see just how

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.010 
so you guys now you can see just how
much<00:03:24.800> slower<00:03:25.280> cosmic<00:03:25.940> Mario<00:03:26.270> is<00:03:26.450> the<00:03:26.480> cosmic

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
much slower cosmic Mario is the cosmic

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:33.280 
much slower cosmic Mario is the cosmic
Luigi<00:03:27.560> I<00:03:29.380> got<00:03:30.380> three<00:03:30.530> more<00:03:30.709> these<00:03:30.950> to<00:03:31.130> do
