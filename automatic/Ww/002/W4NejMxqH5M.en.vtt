00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.390
 little friends of the forest and unibet 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.939
 Hello 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:25.290
 remmy him and sun because he 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.330
 ad 25 degrees Wednesday in paris for 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.340
 the pg barcelona whose going crazy 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.200
 who also takes something that 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.790
 could necessarily benefit from liam 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.620
 So here we are enjoying the sun 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.000
 finally I removed that because I imagine 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.930
 that those who watch the video I can 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.260
 scare the children 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.690
 it's a little raspberry but before 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.550
 that's talking about porto bayern which is 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.970
 probably the most 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.640
 unbalanced in any case these matches 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:54.650
 to go 1-5 for the win the port 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.470
 home 310 2 draws 1 73 for bayern 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.160
 for bayern 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.320
 for now we do not have the impression 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.970
 that they have drawn so much from their 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.170
 reserves it could happen when 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.560
 even regularly enough to put me 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.869
 monumental sheets an opponent thinks 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.520
 even though the Bavarians are 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.390
 in all sectors of 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.990
 play so I think if they play this 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.170
 match with the necessary concentration 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:25.290
 the suspense should already have killed for the 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:28.440
 return match and bends the famous father and 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.860
 barcelona there is no longer the 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:36.030
 co-authors are not hyper on the side of the pg 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.880
 4.40 the victory of the psg 3 70 the null price 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.240
 interesting and 1.90 the victory of the 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.710
 barça 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.960
 so obviously already when you 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.130
 Barça has no reason 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.240
 even in full 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:56.220
 this optimistic is not that the Catalans 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.560
 dominates the planet uefa as it was the 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.500
 case there are four five seasons for a 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.930
 rather simple reason is that iniesta and 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.299
 especially xavi its little bit declining 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.530
 even boosket what is normal they 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.690
 are not all young and then they have 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.640
 so played two games so at 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.670
 midfield level the barca 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.930
 is no longer barça of yesteryear however they 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.459
 have an incredible attack that is 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.800
 certainly the best attack of the 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:24.900
 world with suarez messi and neymar 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.130
 we saw it I think are the two 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.700
 maps we still have both matches 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.510
 hen 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:33.240
 I think at five they had to have 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.220
 six goal chances they scored five 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:41.020
 so the realism of the Catalan attacked 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:44.920
 this is obviously the key to this quarter 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.990
 of final obviously the psg will play this 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.430
 first leg at the parc des princes ampputé 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:54.220
 40 % of its holders david luiz 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.590
 injured thiago motta who could play 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.400
 but my opinion if it is she who would 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.400
 either in 2011 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.380
 vera tibre has suspended loukas in phase of 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.140
 reprise 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.340
 to have suspended this makes a lot of air 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.380
 to have a lot of problems in the 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.230
 camp opposite 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.790
 now the psg for many months 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.550
 and many years has given 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:20.319
 guaranteed at the park they still 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:22.459
 beaten you have to remember the barca 3 2 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.920
 during matches of chickens while they 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.600
 he had already Vait santiago silva 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:32.269
 and without ibrahimovic 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:34.069
 so why do not we know we know where 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.560
 can happen we know that the psg has a 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:39.980
 asset in this game is the aerial game 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.330
 where they are stronger than the Catalans 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.600
 probably on kicks 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.510
 arrested 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.840
 sometimes assisted by defensive absences from 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:51.170
 this level there on the side of the barça here 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.120
 it will be necessary for the pg to be realistic 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.900
 a Belgian will have opportunities that's 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:00.950
 sure it is realistic always the case 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:04.310
 but go home as already optimistic 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:09.430
 predict a draw of the juve of mona 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:10.790
 what Thursday to a short victory of psg 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.310
 maybe two 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:17.329
 a trick or a little 1-0 that are 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.859
 also held that only 20 because 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.660
 the it will allow the psg to recover 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:24.110
 still a lot of people for the for 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:26.450
 the way back here we expect a lot from the 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.940
 hinge marquinhos thiago silva foot 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:32.150
 the one that will carry huge 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:34.310
 responsibilities facing ataq from the barça and 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.979
 and then that's hyper that tin sky 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.229
 can come na na ravier pastore who 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:40.630
 is always exceptional when 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:42.260
 Catalans then in addition now he is 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:47.060
 exceptional in other matches 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:49.350
 also no and above all we see a big 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.950
 football game 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:56.770
 that's almost what's essential 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:05:02.550
 all said with some gravity 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:02.550
 because France is afraid never forget it
