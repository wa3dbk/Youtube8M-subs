00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 Have you ever asked yourself that? 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.430
 why so many different toothbrushes 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.080
 there are hard there are soft there 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.210
 are some with grooves down to it 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.280
 there is electric with us turning 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.309
 today everything about the topic toothbrushes and 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.260
 we meet right now julia stain and 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.699
 manager of toto think one 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.699
 answer expensive questions 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.350
 but it is better for my teeth 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.940
 a hard toothbrush or a soft one 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.350
 That's a tough one to come 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.050
 always entirely on the customer needs to 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.460
 that means I have sensitive 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.840
 gums I have exposed 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.220
 of course, I have to do a great job on my necks 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.530
 Use soft toothbrush 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.550
 that means that in bristles more often than 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.340
 at a middle or at a 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.840
 hard brush and becomes the supersoft 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.360
 his brush my teeth as well 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.949
 Thoroughly clean like the hard one 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.660
 Dentists actually recommend 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.090
 tends to be a soft toothbrush 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.540
 because customers tend to be too hard 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.739
 to press 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.690
 that is natural 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.030
 sensitive gums and there must 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.260
 Take care of the cleaning performance 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.520
 You can say it in now 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.500
 actually as good as you have to 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.150
 maybe the softest number one 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.440
 Clean a bit thoroughly but then 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.390
 it is not a difference 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.250
 which is the better pay 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.159
 would have the electric toothbrush the 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.270
 conventional hand toothbrush qualitatively 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.430
 there is no difference in terms 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.690
 the cleaning performance of one 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.909
 electric toothbrush or one 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.140
 hand toothbrush that is to say both have 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.270
 actually the same result wise 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.409
 Teeth clean teeth at one 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.390
 Electric toothbrush is fine 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.340
 faster and easier is two minutes 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.770
 the ideal cleaning time and mine 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.359
 hand toothbrush three minutes even the 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.640
 mother with heart wrote us 

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:42.560
 how is it when children are 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.960
 now motor not yet developed 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.509
 who in children maybe electric 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.490
 Toothbrush better and more suitable than 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.719
 the conventional toothbrush here too 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.950
 the same topic applies 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:53.030
 Of course it works faster and faster 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.829
 easier with the electric 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.509
 toothbrush but you have to do the same 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.100
 be behind and see that 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.149
 correct cleaning technique is learned 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.829
 whether I have a hand toothbrush now 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.609
 use or is an electrical 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.399
 not really matter 

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:06.320
 a question has reached us there is the 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.939
 special toothbrushes for dental braces 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.050
 carrier yes there is our 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:14.540
 assortment and that is where we have the 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.000
 junior bracket toothbrush there we have 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.100
 especially shorter filaments in the 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.230
 brush inside the head that means that the 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:25.390
 bristles do not stick to the rating 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.390
 going for so auÃŸenrum said exactly 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.020
 the sina and written she wanted 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.360
 know how are the bristles in 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.200
 the toothbrush threaded that is 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.110
 of course a complex one 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.310
 production process behind it 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.440
 but simplified 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.680
 here you see filaments that are 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.470
 then the bristles, so to speak 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.850
 of course and the boston the 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.920
 filaments are then bundle 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.440
 summarized and become these bundles 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.370
 then with these anchors in the bristles 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.630
 head fixed the next question had to 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.550
 we explain because I understand them 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.310
 namely not quite why are at 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.550
 a toothbrush filaments 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.440
 rounded 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:14.450
 if you are looking for a sensitive toothbrush 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.860
 are so thin helps you know love 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.110
 she and that is it so that all 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.910
 filaments are always rounded off both 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.650
 Toothbrushes at a sensitive 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.020
 It is, however, so that the toothbrush 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.240
 filaments are pointed that they 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.430
 even thinner are even finer and thus 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.870
 just sensitive and thus they can do that 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.240
 of course, do not hurt the gums 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.190
 what can be the reason for that 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.060
 that the bristle after brushing 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.980
 fail 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.180
 So actually with a quality 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.710
 be sausages should not at all 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.230
 happen that the bristles fail 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.610
 we have very strict 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.470
 Quality Assurance 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.870
 that the bristles definitely stay in there 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.450
 in the brushhead there will be different in the 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.620
 train tests made that is what force 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.120
 I would have to raise with them 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.370
 ever go out and you need 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.840
 The voters power so much 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.840
 not they are going to in no case to 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:10.230
 for the cs here remember the 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.850
 back the tooth offers what am I doing 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.400
 because with the grooves are the grooves 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.830
 tongue cleaner around the tongue of occupy 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.480
 and remove bacteria and the tongue 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:20.670
 Cleaning should actually be daily 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.940
 Dental care is more important than other tours 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.940
 Turn over exactly and scrape off the coverings 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.940
 scrape off 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.520
 but you can do it too 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.290
 just want to hold 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.210
 and now seriously at the end of the 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.260
 day without toothbrush yes only one 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.960
 plus where do they come from? 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.490
 different prices are the prices 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.050
 decisive which filaments I 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.550
 that uses what bristles and 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.040
 as the breakfast of course made 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.320
 is and william has us the question of all 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.720
 Asked how often should I 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.430
 Should I change my toothbrush? 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.290
 a general statement is hard to 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.960
 meet because depending on how hard pushes 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:58.080
 For example, we will see here now 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.400
 on a robot test which as agreed 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.260
 that's not mine that definitely is not 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.820
 my at the so-called bouquet 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.920
 effect that means the bristles end 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.540
 turn outward and thus have 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.040
 not all posts end the 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.510
 possibility in the interdental spaces too 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.890
 arrive and thus of course that is 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.470
 cleaning performance is no longer given 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.850
 and experiential say after two to 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.770
 Three months should be the latest 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.420
 Change toothbrush and it agrees 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.540
 that I have my toothbrush after one 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:23.130
 flu snuff disease to dispose of 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.020
 she's right he's definitely right 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.580
 in any case by that that the 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.740
 Toothbrush always in contact with the 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.480
 saliva is that means we with the 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.500
 mucous membranes are there then of course 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.690
 also always the bacteria at the 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.180
 Toothbrush and therefore always change to 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.460
 a disease away there will be many people 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.560
 thanks for the beautiful simple many 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.150
 thanks to you all for your great questions 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.980
 We would be very happy if you at 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:47.300
 next time should be there again 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.300
 I now first circuit
