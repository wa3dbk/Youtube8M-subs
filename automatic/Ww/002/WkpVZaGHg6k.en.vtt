it's like the square
I<00:06:41.309> can<00:06:41.639> then<00:06:41.789> scale<00:06:42.089> the<00:06:42.269> square<00:06:42.539> square<00:06:43.229> has

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:43.979

I can then scale the square square has
bigger<00:06:44.219> to<00:06:44.339> smaller<00:06:44.369> than<00:06:44.729> 70<00:06:45.419> 80<00:06:45.689> and<00:06:46.469> I<00:06:47.039> can

00:06:47.179 --> 00:06:47.189 
bigger to smaller than 70 80 and I can

00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:51.349 
bigger to smaller than 70 80 and I can
place<00:06:47.369> it<00:06:47.519> into<00:06:47.639> the<00:06:47.759> world<00:06:49.729> my<00:06:50.729> house<00:06:50.939> and
