we're going to do is we're going to draw
lines<00:02:31.500> parallel<00:02:32.100> lines<00:02:32.810> along<00:02:33.810> each<00:02:34.200> of<00:02:34.260> the

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
lines parallel lines along each of the

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.460 
lines parallel lines along each of the
halves<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.400> heart<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:35.940> make<00:02:36.870> sure<00:02:37.170> that

halves to the heart and make sure that

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.020 
halves to the heart and make sure that
they<00:02:37.590> touch<00:02:37.800> from<00:02:38.010> here<00:02:38.310> to<00:02:38.670> here

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
they touch from here to here

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.540 
they touch from here to here
and<00:02:39.120> make<00:02:40.080> sure<00:02:40.290> that<00:02:40.560> they're<00:02:40.800> about<00:02:41.070> half<00:02:41.400> an

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
and make sure that they're about half an

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.880 
and make sure that they're about half an
inch<00:02:41.640> apart<00:02:41.870> so<00:02:42.870> I'm<00:02:43.080> just<00:02:43.260> going<00:02:43.380> to<00:02:43.410> make<00:02:43.650> I'm

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
inch apart so I'm just going to make I'm

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.220 
inch apart so I'm just going to make I'm
just<00:02:43.950> going<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.370> measure<00:02:44.640> out<00:02:44.910> two<00:02:45.270> of<00:02:45.990> my

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
just going to measure out two of my
