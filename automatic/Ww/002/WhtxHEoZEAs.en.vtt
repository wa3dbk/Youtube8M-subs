00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:34.100 

you<00:01:30.789> know<00:01:30.909> what

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:54.980 

and<00:01:34.760> anger<00:01:35.760> right<00:01:36.150> now

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.249 

technology

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
technology

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.340 
technology
would<00:01:56.799> it<00:01:56.920> be<00:01:57.039> possible<00:01:57.460> to<00:01:57.520> run<00:01:57.850> applications

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
would it be possible to run applications

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.889 
would it be possible to run applications
and<00:01:59.350> instead<00:02:00.280> of<00:02:00.340> just<00:02:00.640> video<00:02:02.490> yeah<00:02:03.490> okay<00:02:04.390> so

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
and instead of just video yeah okay so

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:07.319 
and instead of just video yeah okay so
for<00:02:05.740> example<00:02:06.039> data<00:02:06.189> I<00:02:06.310> guess<00:02:06.490> is<00:02:06.640> an<00:02:07.000> actual

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 
for example data I guess is an actual

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:09.570 
for example data I guess is an actual
computer<00:02:07.509> just<00:02:07.960> running<00:02:08.349> that<00:02:08.470> video<00:02:08.739> so<00:02:09.429> if

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
computer just running that video so if

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.369 
computer just running that video so if
you<00:02:09.789> close<00:02:10.179> the<00:02:10.330> video<00:02:10.450> do<00:02:10.929> you<00:02:11.019> see<00:02:11.200> the

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:11.379 
you close the video do you see the

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:13.589 
you close the video do you see the
actual<00:02:11.739> like<00:02:12.129> Windows<00:02:12.580> machine<00:02:12.970> is<00:02:13.090> a<00:02:13.120> is<00:02:13.450> it

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
actual like Windows machine is a is it

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:21.050 
actual like Windows machine is a is it
Windows

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:28.150 

and<00:02:21.420> then<00:02:21.630> it's

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.699 

okay<00:02:28.850> it's<00:02:29.600> not<00:02:29.780> like<00:02:29.930> that<00:02:30.410> I'd<00:02:30.530> like<00:02:30.800> that

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.350 

it's<00:02:35.010> pretty<00:02:35.250> much<00:02:35.400> like<00:02:35.459> the<00:02:35.790> flight<00:02:36.030> thought

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
it's pretty much like the flight thought

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.830 
it's pretty much like the flight thought
so

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.330 
so
and<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:39.019> machine<00:02:39.349> that<00:02:39.469> is<00:02:39.560> running<00:02:39.590> that<00:02:40.069> is

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
and the machine that is running that is

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.740 
and the machine that is running that is
it<00:02:40.670> a<00:02:40.700> Windows<00:02:41.150> machine<00:02:41.299> or<00:02:41.719> is<00:02:41.840> it<00:02:42.019> an<00:02:42.859> Mac<00:02:43.189> or

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
it a Windows machine or is it an Mac or

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.979 
it a Windows machine or is it an Mac or
it's<00:02:44.750> a<00:02:44.900> Windows<00:02:45.200> machine<00:02:45.519> wow<00:02:46.599> that's<00:02:47.599> pretty

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:49.000 
it's a Windows machine wow that's pretty
cool

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:48.170 

what<00:03:41.920> kind<00:03:42.220> of<00:03:42.340> modular<00:03:42.850> realize

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.830 

you<00:03:48.719> have<00:03:48.870> an<00:03:48.989> approximate<00:03:49.290> like<00:03:49.829> a<00:03:50.099> couple<00:03:50.670> of

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
you have an approximate like a couple of

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:58.160 
you have an approximate like a couple of
thousands<00:03:53.780> okay<00:03:55.099> it<00:03:56.329> is<00:03:57.329> available<00:03:57.870> you<00:03:57.989> can

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
thousands okay it is available you can

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.050 
thousands okay it is available you can
buy<00:03:58.409> it<00:03:58.760> okay

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:09.600 

yeah<00:04:04.550> and<00:04:05.550> then<00:04:05.819> yeah

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.910 

so<00:04:10.180> for<00:04:10.540> example<00:04:10.930> the<00:04:11.440> difference<00:04:11.770> between

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
so for example the difference between

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.890 
so for example the difference between
this<00:04:12.250> one<00:04:12.430> this<00:04:12.640> one<00:04:12.880> that's<00:04:13.120> just<00:04:13.300> a<00:04:13.600> normal

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
this one this one that's just a normal

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.550 
this one this one that's just a normal
string<00:04:14.200> that's<00:04:14.710> just<00:04:14.920> a<00:04:14.980> video<00:04:15.250> screen

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:35.500 

like<00:04:21.270> that

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.960 

you<00:04:35.600> know<00:04:35.740> figure

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:56.100 

yeah

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.570 

okay<00:04:57.110> do<00:04:57.530> you<00:04:57.590> have<00:04:57.680> information<00:04:57.949> about<00:04:58.370> the

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
okay do you have information about the

00:05:00.369 --> 00:05:00.379 
name of the product so we can look for

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:03.070 
name of the product so we can look for
it

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.800 

the<00:05:03.500> Transperth<00:05:04.039> displays<00:05:04.460> 22-inch<00:05:05.180> sighs

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
the Transperth displays 22-inch sighs

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:06.670 
the Transperth displays 22-inch sighs
okay

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680
