00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:04.930
 ranomi big but we are completely ready for yes it is going very well i feel 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.220
 I am very happy with Sunday and it goes very well and 

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:13.279
 tell our country where it goes exactly in 20th place but I'm sitting 

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:15.129
 for the world cup in manchester 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:18.310
 yes basically I am already qualified only this is the second and last 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.619
 moment and you can't the rest also try not to set it up so 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.739
 as long as nothing is wrong with the fastest two-seater, but we have to 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:29.749
 two others are and will be faster than they are anyway, but I am out of it 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:31.980
 give that extra pressure 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.690
 all aspects 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.950
 but not really happy for myself from and 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.000
 donate and press 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.420
 and you get the two years and that's just disagree and the and jaap 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.870
 addresses to be found on must 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.320
 and the pda do nothing about it 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.330
 in herenthout a lot is doing what is finally doing 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.860
 no not only in the netherlands but also not in it 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.790
 abroad I of course always like to keep you up to date 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.640
 but that it really results 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.120
 twitter has after playing on the internet or robbery times comes from them and 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.390
 occurs it is not his 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.730
 they did not indicate it, but they did think that this should be their peak moment 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.160
 of course there in Shanghai expo peak times 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.270
 and then think of it would be big mouth and works differently anyway but I like this 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.850
 moment that is the wk why this also 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.340
 on the basis that who must of course qualify and 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.020
 well of course i hope i can tell after a fairly easy 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.260
 can qualify in March this is a moment to test how it is 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.440
 and he has things to do well something so on the wk also want to do 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.770
 Ultimately the World Cup is with the and with a big moment of this season alone 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.820
 This is really a moment to see he was going to do it and how 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.280
 do we want to do it in the world cup ajax is just as briefly as the 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.890
 peak time then you should be in top form and that is why my first one was 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.830
 ask metropolis 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.390
 especially at least it goes very well 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.920
 You have or expect that if there is a very large rolling project always expected 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.670
 every year saves a lot of expectations but it is going very well and I think it is 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.400
 egg yolk broadcast from the weekend and and the rest of the Dutch team too 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.000
 yes i think you can speak the ampera on a top format but then what is it 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.700
 difference between very good shape and top format is that difference that nuance 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.139
 and 

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:14.819
 it is striking is is the world performance and i think i dont know 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.859
 do not think that I now put down this weekend and where the reformed school 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:21.089
 well and doing things and an ipod is a fact 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:25.810
 What is the position of the Netherlands in comparison with other countries? 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:31.040
 after each the distances that xm 50 and 100 are free are really very strong and that's it 

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:33.669
 is it also the problem actually in the Netherlands 

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:37.609
 and those are 4 5 7 6 3 not satisfying what is two 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:41.929
 is really a competition at home there will run beyond the and to 

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:44.619
 the wk may you then your own toko in the 

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:48.619
 yes top 5 of the world actually it is yes if you commit me to 

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:50.329
 then but i have good chances 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.469
 just a little more meijer tattoo because in you have much more to be ing 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:56.829
 and in cafe 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.829
 self about soon before the World Cup, one will arrive at Huub Koch 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:01.809
 and the 

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:05.959
 the cda that of course also remains there now that that's the goal yes 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:07.439
