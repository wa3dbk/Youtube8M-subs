00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.900
 Since the beginning of 2006, the third generation of the Mazda mx-5 is on the market 

00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:12.739
 The current series was initially as well as the previous generations alone 

00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:14.629
 to have with fabric roof 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.599
 Many year-round riders therefore have their mx-5 in the past 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:20.730
 upgraded a hardtop 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.820
 from the model year 2007 Chappaz of this hotline to a great 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.569
 To offer compromise 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:30.629
 the top version, the Japanese make a coupe variant with Jannik Fischer 

00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:33.629
 Central Office roof construction to be 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.390
 from the bonnet to the end of the doors 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.000
 This second mx-5 roof variant is visually identical to the Soft ob Roadster 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.900
 first rear area mostly smaller differences 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.870
 so was the coupe the convertible top covers 4 and the boot lid 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.300
 increased by two inches 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.450
 thanks to these marginal changes 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.610
 Dieter k despite of Mazda really many of his conspecifics 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.620
 a point on the project 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.640
 the design is harmonious and even when closed, the mx-5 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.640
 Roadster coupe worth seeing 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.720
 as elegant as the roof construction looks, it disappears so elegantly 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.460
 sold 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.470
 only twelve seconds, the three-piece plastic hood with help 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.470
 some electric motors way 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.720
 previously only a lever between Bach and windscreen must be paid 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.030
 the folded mx-5 hood takes place behind the seats and in front of the trunk 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.790
 space 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.790
 so the luggage compartment will not be in volume at 1 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.189
 also when driving fun, everything remains as it has always been used to the BMX five 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:49.270
 is 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.320
 from the 37 girls 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.320
 the upholstery profile is sporty 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.270
 to have the mx-5 as a roadster coupe 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.310
 126 HP strong 1 4 8-liter petrol engine 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.490
 from 25 thousand 500 euros 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.050
 Incidentally, these are 1007 Waltrop and more than comparable ones 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.749
 Variant with fabric roof 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:16.459
 a more investment that can be worthwhile
