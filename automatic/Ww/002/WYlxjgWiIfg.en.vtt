00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
in the field so we've got a cover

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.500 
in the field so we've got a cover
mechanism<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.550> we<00:00:56.670> can<00:00:56.850> use<00:00:56.879> let<00:00:57.270> me<00:00:57.329> see<00:00:57.449> if

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
mechanism that we can use let me see if

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.680 
mechanism that we can use let me see if
I<00:00:57.570> can<00:00:57.690> get<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.930> good<00:00:58.109> place<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.620> use<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:59.690> so

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
I can get to a good place to use that so

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.380 
I can get to a good place to use that so
now<00:01:00.809> we've<00:01:00.930> got<00:01:01.109> lean<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.469> peek<00:01:01.649> here<00:01:02.239> in<00:01:03.239> a

comes his buddy now we've got a nice
complex<00:01:30.450> rag<00:01:30.720> doll<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.290> system<00:01:32.250> where<00:01:32.400> we're

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
complex rag doll a system where we're

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.539 
complex rag doll a system where we're
coupling<00:01:33.329> physics<00:01:33.780> mocap<00:01:34.380> rag<00:01:34.740> doll<00:01:35.040> and

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
coupling physics mocap rag doll and

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.679 
coupling physics mocap rag doll and
we're<00:01:35.640> trying<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:35.909> get<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.119> all<00:01:36.210> integrated

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
we're trying to get it all integrated

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.590 
we're trying to get it all integrated
into<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.020> single<00:01:37.439> system<00:01:38.689> there<00:01:39.689> he<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:41.479> so<00:01:42.479> as

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
into a single system there he is so as

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.880 
into a single system there he is so as
you<00:01:42.720> can<00:01:42.840> see<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.140> was<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.500> very<00:01:43.649> dynamic

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
you can see that was a very dynamic

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.139 
you can see that was a very dynamic
every<00:01:44.430> one<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.700> them<00:01:44.790> is<00:01:44.850> going<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.060> be

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
every one of them is going to be

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.910 
every one of them is going to be
different<00:01:45.360> one<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.780> neat<00:01:45.930> parts<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.380> when

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
different one of the neat parts is when

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.469 
different one of the neat parts is when
we're<00:01:47.130> playing<00:01:47.220> if<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.670> shoot<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.090> Helghast

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
we're playing if you shoot a Helghast

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.389 
we're playing if you shoot a Helghast
while<00:01:48.810> their<00:01:49.020> area<00:01:49.500> if<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.740> kill<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.280> hell

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
while their area if you kill the hell

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.429 
while their area if you kill the hell
gasps<00:01:50.610> wall-e<00:01:50.909> shooting<00:01:51.509> you'll<00:01:52.200> actually

bounce right off the table that got his

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.250 
bounce right off the table that got his
attention<00:02:29.030> and<00:02:30.030> there's<00:02:30.629> another<00:02:30.900> explosive
