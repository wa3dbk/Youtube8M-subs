I paid with my debit card so I slid the
card<00:03:35.130> through<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.400> thing<00:03:35.700> so<00:03:36.030> then<00:03:36.180> the

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
card through the thing so then the

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.000 
card through the thing so then the
little<00:03:36.600> touchscreen<00:03:37.080> thing<00:03:37.260> comes<00:03:37.500> on<00:03:37.680> and<00:03:37.950> I

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
little touchscreen thing comes on and I

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.740 
little touchscreen thing comes on and I
think<00:03:38.070> of<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.430> pen<00:03:38.640> and<00:03:39.060> I<00:03:39.150> start<00:03:39.420> to<00:03:39.510> tap

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
think of the pen and I start to tap

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.320 
think of the pen and I start to tap
stuff<00:03:40.110> and<00:03:40.320> nothing<00:03:41.070> is<00:03:41.310> working<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:42.030> I'm

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
stuff and nothing is working and I'm

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.970 
stuff and nothing is working and I'm
like<00:03:42.510> what<00:03:42.690> what's<00:03:43.050> going<00:03:43.230> on<00:03:43.410> and<00:03:43.650> then<00:03:43.950> I

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
like what what's going on and then I

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.979 
like what what's going on and then I
realized<00:03:44.400> that<00:03:44.640> I<00:03:44.850> was<00:03:45.030> holding<00:03:45.360> an<00:03:45.480> actual

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
realized that I was holding an actual

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.500 
realized that I was holding an actual
pen<00:03:46.260> that<00:03:46.860> someone<00:03:47.190> had<00:03:47.340> just<00:03:47.489> left<00:03:47.760> next<00:03:48.300> to

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
pen that someone had just left next to

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.479 
pen that someone had just left next to
the<00:03:48.600> machine<00:03:48.959> that's<00:03:49.200> why<00:03:49.500> it<00:03:49.890> wasn't<00:03:50.310> working

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
the machine that's why it wasn't working

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.640 
the machine that's why it wasn't working
so<00:03:51.030> I'm<00:03:51.270> like<00:03:51.420> wow<00:03:51.660> really<00:03:52.230> and<00:03:52.350> I<00:03:52.440> looked<00:03:52.620> back

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
so I'm like wow really and I looked back

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.290 
so I'm like wow really and I looked back
at<00:03:52.890> the<00:03:52.920> cashier<00:03:53.430> she's<00:03:53.700> kind<00:03:53.910> of<00:03:53.970> giving<00:03:54.180> me<00:03:54.209> a
