00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
going through and I'm trying a lot of

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.869 
going through and I'm trying a lot of
weapons<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.750> haven't<00:00:39.960> used<00:00:40.230> before<00:00:40.350> so

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
weapons that I haven't used before so

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.479 
weapons that I haven't used before so
this<00:00:41.879> was<00:00:42.559> borrowing<00:00:43.559> me<00:00:43.710> getting<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:43.980> 25

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489

this<00:00:48.030> was<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.270> first<00:00:48.809> game<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.500> I'd

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
this was the first game that I'd

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.080 
this was the first game that I'd
actually<00:00:49.890> properly<00:00:50.309> used<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.960> as<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.230> can<00:00:52.350> see

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
actually properly used it as you can see

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.819 
actually properly used it as you can see
the<00:00:54.090> team<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.719> were<00:00:54.960> defending<00:00:55.410> before

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
the team that were defending before

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.819 
the team that were defending before
obviously<00:00:56.430> lost<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.480> first<00:00:57.660> base<00:00:57.899> on<00:00:58.530> white

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
obviously lost the first base on white

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.910 
obviously lost the first base on white
pass<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.719> thought<00:01:00.719> fuck<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.050> we<00:01:01.530> can't<00:01:01.800> be

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
pass and thought fuck it we can't be

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.340 
pass and thought fuck it we can't be
asked<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.280> defend<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:03.000> next<00:01:03.270> two<00:01:03.870> bases

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
asked to defend the next two bases

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.310 
asked to defend the next two bases
probably<00:01:05.309> down<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.820> facts<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.420> due<00:01:07.110> to

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
probably down to the facts the due to

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.859 
probably down to the facts the due to
what<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.680> could<00:01:08.220> see<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.549> bit<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.270> design

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
what I could see is a bit of a design

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.380 
what I could see is a bit of a design
flaw<00:01:10.229> with<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:10.650> map<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.490> second<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.330> third

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
flaw with this map the second and third

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.830 
flaw with this map the second and third
base<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:13.880> both<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.909> M<00:01:15.090> conversations<00:01:15.720> are

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
base is both the M conversations are

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.080 
base is both the M conversations are
indestructible<00:01:16.200> buildings<00:01:16.729> which<00:01:17.729> means

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
indestructible buildings which means

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.969 
indestructible buildings which means
that<00:01:18.270> if<00:01:18.720> you're<00:01:18.990> putting<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.590> really<00:01:19.860> really

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
that if you're putting a really really

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.980 
that if you're putting a really really
good<00:01:20.130> defense<00:01:20.520> up<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.150> you're<00:01:21.479> holding<00:01:21.780> the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
good defense up and you're holding the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.620 
good defense up and you're holding the
other<00:01:22.080> team<00:01:22.320> off<00:01:22.500> getting<00:01:22.740> arms<00:01:23.630> the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
other team off getting arms the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.780 
other team off getting arms the
attacking<00:01:25.439> team<00:01:25.590> can<00:01:26.189> just<00:01:26.430> blow<00:01:26.640> the

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
attacking team can just blow the

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.490 
attacking team can just blow the
buildings<00:01:27.150> up<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:27.540> they<00:01:27.659> can<00:01:27.900> sit<00:01:28.200> quite<00:01:28.470> a

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
buildings up so they can sit quite a

collapse the buildings to win the match

the<00:01:55.409> end<00:01:55.530> we<00:01:55.649> decided<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:56.219> stick<00:01:56.670> with<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:56.909> and

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
the end we decided to stick with it and

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.899 
the end we decided to stick with it and
the<00:01:58.500> strategy<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.130> we<00:01:59.280> thought<00:01:59.520> would<00:01:59.729> be<00:01:59.790> a

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
the strategy that we thought would be a

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.580 
the strategy that we thought would be a
good<00:02:00.030> idea<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.360> run<00:02:00.719> would<00:02:01.110> be<00:02:01.259> quite<00:02:01.500> an

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
good idea to run would be quite an

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.010 
good idea to run would be quite an
aggressive<00:02:01.770> one<00:02:02.430> so<00:02:03.210> what<00:02:03.479> we<00:02:03.630> would<00:02:03.719> try<00:02:03.960> and

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
aggressive one so what we would try and

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.959 
aggressive one so what we would try and
do<00:02:04.229> because<00:02:04.409> these<00:02:04.770> two<00:02:05.100> bases<00:02:05.490> are<00:02:05.640> very<00:02:05.820> very

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
do because these two bases are very very

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.300 
do because these two bases are very very
close<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.540> each<00:02:06.570> other<00:02:06.869> we<00:02:07.649> would<00:02:07.860> try<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.190> get

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
close to each other we would try and get

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.770 
close to each other we would try and get
up<00:02:08.340> in<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.610> enemy's<00:02:08.910> faces<00:02:09.330> as<00:02:09.450> much<00:02:09.629> as

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
up in the enemy's faces as much as

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.570 
up in the enemy's faces as much as
possible<00:02:09.989> as<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:10.920> can<00:02:11.009> see<00:02:11.190> there<00:02:11.340> mean<00:02:11.489> I

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
possible as you can see there mean I

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.190 
possible as you can see there mean I
didn't<00:02:11.819> actually<00:02:11.940> get<00:02:12.239> any<00:02:12.420> kills<00:02:12.660> there<00:02:12.989> but

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
didn't actually get any kills there but

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.490 
didn't actually get any kills there but
we

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
we

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.120 
we
already<00:02:13.680> taking<00:02:14.010> him<00:02:14.100> down<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.430> 55<00:02:14.940> tickets

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
already taking him down to 55 tickets

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.440 
already taking him down to 55 tickets
which<00:02:17.130> is<00:02:17.280> fairly<00:02:17.490> good<00:02:17.790> they've<00:02:18.120> managed<00:02:18.420> to

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
which is fairly good they've managed to

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.720 
which is fairly good they've managed to
get<00:02:18.600> a<00:02:18.660> choice<00:02:18.870> set<00:02:19.140> on<00:02:19.230> alpha<00:02:19.710> I<00:02:19.920> saw<00:02:20.520> a<00:02:20.550> guy

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
get a choice set on alpha I saw a guy

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.690 
get a choice set on alpha I saw a guy
trying<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.210> sneak<00:02:21.450> in<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:21.810> get<00:02:21.960> be<00:02:22.700> most

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
trying to sneak in and get be most

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.190 
trying to sneak in and get be most
shooting<00:02:24.090> in<00:02:24.210> his<00:02:24.300> bottom<00:02:24.510> there<00:02:24.900> which<00:02:25.080> is

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
shooting in his bottom there which is

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.260 
shooting in his bottom there which is
really<00:02:25.410> really<00:02:25.560> nice<00:02:25.800> so<00:02:26.730> as<00:02:26.850> you<00:02:27.000> can<00:02:27.090> see

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
really really nice so as you can see

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.760 
really really nice so as you can see
there<00:02:27.420> we<00:02:27.540> managed<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:27.810> get<00:02:27.930> alpha<00:02:28.290> disarmed

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
there we managed to get alpha disarmed

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.010 
there we managed to get alpha disarmed
as<00:02:28.890> well<00:02:29.160> which<00:02:30.150> left<00:02:30.420> me<00:02:30.510> with<00:02:30.600> a<00:02:30.750> little<00:02:30.900> bit

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
as well which left me with a little bit

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.750 
as well which left me with a little bit
of<00:02:31.080> confidence<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:32.040> we<00:02:32.130> might<00:02:32.340> not<00:02:32.520> be

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
of confidence that we might not be

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.120 
of confidence that we might not be
playing<00:02:33.600> against<00:02:33.990> a<00:02:34.080> bunch<00:02:34.260> of<00:02:34.410> fuckwits<00:02:34.920> you

playing against a bunch of fuckwits you

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
stats that would being that they've

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.140 
stats that would being that they've
already<00:02:40.380> got<00:02:40.680> alpha<00:02:41.160> arms<00:02:41.700> we've<00:02:41.880> managed<00:02:42.090> to

trying to shoot a dead guy and I get

trying to shoot a dead guy and I get
distracted<00:03:12.870> by<00:03:13.050> these<00:03:13.170> two<00:03:13.470> guys<00:03:13.650> I<00:03:13.980> didn't

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
distracted by these two guys I didn't

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.430 
distracted by these two guys I didn't
actually<00:03:14.670> end<00:03:15.030> up<00:03:15.180> attempting<00:03:15.630> a<00:03:15.900> disarm<00:03:16.290> but

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
actually end up attempting a disarm but

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.660 
actually end up attempting a disarm but
I<00:03:16.470> think<00:03:16.709> I'd<00:03:16.860> have<00:03:16.980> been<00:03:17.070> a<00:03:17.100> little<00:03:17.250> bit<00:03:17.459> too

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
I think I'd have been a little bit too

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.509 
I think I'd have been a little bit too
late<00:03:17.910> for<00:03:18.450> it<00:03:18.570> anyway<00:03:18.930> they<00:03:19.500> go<00:03:19.680> Alf<00:03:19.920> destroyed

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
late for it anyway they go Alf destroyed

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.420 
late for it anyway they go Alf destroyed
and<00:03:20.790> we<00:03:21.660> now<00:03:21.870> leave<00:03:22.650> ourselves<00:03:22.830> in<00:03:23.100> a<00:03:23.160> bit<00:03:23.280> of<00:03:23.310> a

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
and we now leave ourselves in a bit of a

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.670 
and we now leave ourselves in a bit of a
tough<00:03:23.610> situation<00:03:23.880> because<00:03:24.420> we<00:03:25.260> were<00:03:25.320> at<00:03:25.410> 30

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
tough situation because we were at 30

to<00:03:28.170> that<00:03:28.350> stage<00:03:28.709> so<00:03:29.519> we've<00:03:29.820> got<00:03:29.940> 37<00:03:30.570> tickets<00:03:30.930> to

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
to that stage so we've got 37 tickets to

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.340 
to that stage so we've got 37 tickets to
take<00:03:31.410> and<00:03:31.880> all<00:03:32.880> of<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.239> enemy<00:03:33.570> need<00:03:33.750> to<00:03:33.870> do<00:03:34.080> is

where bit of a spoiler alert here guys
we<00:03:45.930> actually<00:03:46.079> do<00:03:46.440> manage<00:03:46.799> to<00:03:46.829> hold<00:03:47.100> the

we actually do manage to hold the
opposition<00:03:47.910> off<00:03:48.060> i<00:03:49.040> think<00:03:50.040> they<00:03:50.190> may<00:03:50.400> get

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
opposition off i think they may get

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.120 
opposition off i think they may get
maybe<00:03:51.209> another<00:03:51.480> couple<00:03:51.720> of<00:03:51.930> arms<00:03:52.320> but<00:03:52.950> we

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
maybe another couple of arms but we

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.770 
maybe another couple of arms but we
managed<00:03:53.370> to<00:03:53.400> get<00:03:53.549> the<00:03:53.640> disarms<00:03:54.180> and<00:03:54.390> we

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
managed to get the disarms and we

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.420 
managed to get the disarms and we
managed<00:03:55.079> to<00:03:55.110> stop<00:03:55.500> them<00:03:55.739> from<00:03:55.860> destroying<00:03:56.070> the

us in a game sometimes it can be up to

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.500 
us in a game sometimes it can be up to
six<00:04:13.799> and<00:04:14.040> we'll<00:04:14.130> have<00:04:14.310> two<00:04:14.519> squads<00:04:14.910> of<00:04:15.120> three

six and we'll have two squads of three

six and we'll have two squads of three
in<00:04:15.750> each<00:04:15.959> when<00:04:16.950> we're<00:04:17.100> defending<00:04:17.340> on<00:04:17.519> that

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
in each when we're defending on that

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.289 
in each when we're defending on that
first<00:04:17.910> base<00:04:18.530> I<00:04:19.700> can't<00:04:20.700> think<00:04:20.910> of<00:04:21.000> too<00:04:21.150> many

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
first base I can't think of too many

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:22.969 
first base I can't think of too many
occasions<00:04:21.870> where<00:04:22.049> we've<00:04:22.260> lost<00:04:22.470> that<00:04:22.710> first

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
occasions where we've lost that first

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.130 
occasions where we've lost that first
base<00:04:23.280> and<00:04:23.520> cey<00:04:23.669> not<00:04:24.180> meaning<00:04:24.599> to<00:04:24.630> sound<00:04:24.750> all

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
base and cey not meaning to sound all

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.760 
base and cey not meaning to sound all
cocky<00:04:25.440> and<00:04:25.590> arrogant<00:04:25.740> and<00:04:26.220> look<00:04:26.400> at

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
cocky and arrogant and look at

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.129 
cocky and arrogant and look at
we're<00:04:26.949> fucking<00:04:27.310> amazing<00:04:27.879> but<00:04:28.509> it's<00:04:28.780> quite<00:04:28.990> an

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
we're fucking amazing but it's quite an

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:31.110 
we're fucking amazing but it's quite an
easy<00:04:29.379> base<00:04:29.740> to<00:04:29.949> defend<00:04:30.340> if<00:04:30.520> you've<00:04:30.669> got<00:04:30.849> quite

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
easy base to defend if you've got quite

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.570 
easy base to defend if you've got quite
an<00:04:31.270> organized<00:04:31.660> team<00:04:31.979> because<00:04:32.979> both<00:04:33.190> mcom

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
an organized team because both mcom

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.640 
an organized team because both mcom
stations<00:04:34.180> are<00:04:34.509> in<00:04:34.960> the<00:04:35.050> same<00:04:35.229> building

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
stations are in the same building

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.010 
stations are in the same building
essentially<00:04:36.190> so<00:04:36.759> you<00:04:36.849> can<00:04:37.150> put<00:04:37.330> up<00:04:37.360> quite<00:04:37.930> a

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
essentially so you can put up quite a

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.619 
essentially so you can put up quite a
lot<00:04:38.440> necessarily<00:04:39.099> a<00:04:39.129> campy<00:04:39.639> but<00:04:39.669> a<00:04:40.060> fairly

00:04:40.619 --> 00:04:40.629 
lot necessarily a campy but a fairly

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:43.550 
lot necessarily a campy but a fairly
sort<00:04:40.840> of<00:04:40.900> decent<00:04:41.110> defense<00:04:41.729> around<00:04:42.729> that<00:04:42.940> base

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
sort of decent defense around that base

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.320 
sort of decent defense around that base
so<00:04:44.560> we<00:04:44.800> didn't<00:04:45.220> act<00:04:45.400> we're<00:04:45.580> not<00:04:45.729> actually<00:04:45.879> in

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
so we didn't act we're not actually in

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.089 
so we didn't act we're not actually in
this<00:04:46.539> situation<00:04:46.930> too<00:04:47.349> much<00:04:47.590> where<00:04:47.889> we're

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:48.099 
this situation too much where we're

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:50.219 
this situation too much where we're
having<00:04:48.190> to<00:04:48.490> think<00:04:48.669> on<00:04:48.819> our<00:04:48.879> feet<00:04:49.000> and<00:04:49.419> think<00:04:50.139> of

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:50.229 
having to think on our feet and think of

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:52.499 
having to think on our feet and think of
a<00:04:50.319> different<00:04:50.440> kind<00:04:50.740> of<00:04:50.860> strategy<00:04:51.580> to<00:04:52.030> use<00:04:52.060> to

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:52.509 
a different kind of strategy to use to

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:54.749 
a different kind of strategy to use to
defend<00:04:52.780> on<00:04:52.960> this<00:04:53.139> map<00:04:53.379> but<00:04:54.129> as<00:04:54.280> you<00:04:54.430> can<00:04:54.550> see

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:54.759 
defend on this map but as you can see

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:56.159 
defend on this map but as you can see
here<00:04:54.970> what<00:04:55.120> we're<00:04:55.270> trying<00:04:55.449> to<00:04:55.569> do<00:04:55.810> and<00:04:55.990> what

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
here what we're trying to do and what

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:58.860 
here what we're trying to do and what
I'm<00:04:56.289> trying<00:04:56.500> to<00:04:56.530> do<00:04:56.770> is<00:04:56.979> move<00:04:57.879> myself<00:04:58.120> up<00:04:58.569> too

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
I'm trying to do is move myself up too

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.230 
I'm trying to do is move myself up too
close<00:04:59.259> to<00:04:59.500> their<00:04:59.650> spawn<00:05:00.009> and<00:05:00.310> I'm<00:05:01.060> going<00:05:01.210> to

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
spotting some guys so that my teammates

counter<00:05:25.300> that<00:05:25.330> attack<00:05:25.870> as<00:05:26.319> you<00:05:26.560> can<00:05:26.680> see

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
counter that attack as you can see

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:29.309

some spot assists managed to get on that
dude<00:05:31.750> there<00:05:32.080> and<00:05:32.289> motion<00:05:33.219> mind<00:05:33.400> assists<00:05:33.729> as

dude there and motion mind assists as

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:36.899 
dude there and motion mind assists as
well<00:05:33.849> so<00:05:34.449> even<00:05:34.930> though<00:05:34.960> I<00:05:35.830> didn't<00:05:36.789> get<00:05:36.849> a

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:36.909 
well so even though I didn't get a

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:39.029 
well so even though I didn't get a
massive<00:05:37.300> amount<00:05:37.569> of<00:05:37.599> kills<00:05:37.840> in<00:05:38.080> this<00:05:38.199> game<00:05:38.469> I

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:39.039 
massive amount of kills in this game I

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:40.620 
massive amount of kills in this game I
still<00:05:39.550> would've<00:05:39.729> managed<00:05:39.940> to<00:05:40.030> rack<00:05:40.240> a<00:05:40.270> lot<00:05:40.539> of

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
still would've managed to rack a lot of

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.510 
still would've managed to rack a lot of
points<00:05:40.960> out<00:05:41.110> through<00:05:41.409> the<00:05:41.560> motion<00:05:41.919> mines<00:05:42.190> and

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
points out through the motion mines and

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.149 
points out through the motion mines and
through<00:05:43.240> spotting<00:05:43.719> people<00:05:44.229> so<00:05:44.800> it<00:05:44.919> looks<00:05:45.069> like

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:45.159 
through spotting people so it looks like

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:46.649 
through spotting people so it looks like
we've<00:05:45.430> managed<00:05:45.789> to<00:05:45.909> hold<00:05:46.090> off<00:05:46.270> that<00:05:46.479> little
