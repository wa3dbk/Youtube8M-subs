 I bring them pendergraph this time we are 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.010

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.719
 because I'm special we're in sky wars 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.070
 in the search server if you want the 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:14.990
 pearl of the you have in the description 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.520
 although many of you will already know it because it is 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.170
 a server famous for this mode of 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.730
 game that is the sky wars and for those who 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.560
 do not know that it is sky wars as you can 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.150
 search for youtube because it's a way that 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.160
 he has become famous for very little 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.570
 time has become very famous and that is 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.150
 very fun and entertaining and that to me 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.590
 I love it then I just tell you that if 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.180
 want more videos of skybus me what 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.890
 you can say because I love this 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.870
 game mode when I get bored because I 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.940
 I play skyworks and if you want more 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.489
 Well, I'll go up because I love it 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.860
 then not much more without further dilation 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.680
 let's go with another voucher you have caught 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.480
 the joke we will go with the game if 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.149
 Intro perfect we have entered we are in 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.829
 the map of the pirates we are going to take the 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:53.960
 builder kit because they always go 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.090
 well a few blocks that I think that 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.699
 12 good for those who do not know are 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.540
 different islands which you have to go to 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.730
 for him you have two objectives one 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.199
 kill and another you can go to the middle to see if 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.090
 you take some resources to be able 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.400
 get to annihilate all those people 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.560
 you have around here but I 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.570
 I used to go from island to island to try 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.430
 kill people but everything depends on 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.080
 this one of this friend the chest in all 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.790
 It depends on what you get if you have 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.550
 lucky because this year in luck and if not 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.410
 so post garlic and water 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.300
 then we have had a chest for 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.190
 normalito not quite good but not the 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.680
 all bad here the thing is growing 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.220
 because I had a bow and that 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.900
 inspires a lot of confidence then it's worth 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.460
 go here stop this do not start me 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.350
 give a friend do not start giving me because I 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.690
 I have also candela is , you too 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.540
 could give friend candela to see where you are 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.280
 friend i can also give you chicha 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.619
 I will totally give chicha if I 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.479
 let me give you chicha but if you do not 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.280
 allow us then we will not catch a little 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.820
 of blocks a little bit of this 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.040
 this the second organization chest is what 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.920
 better than you can have so I think 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.550
 that this guy is hidden or has left 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.220
 with a team 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.670
 we will observe I think I'll go 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.780
 for the other side because he was a team 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.840
 we have a person who has already 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.120
 researched perfect friend starts had 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.280
 the thing but better not to talk because if 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.750
 when I always say that I say it starts 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.450
 well the thing well you know what happens that 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.630
 ends up dying and that arrow by for 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:26.140
 eat friend for a little but it has not been 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.640
 sufficient enough to know where 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.250
 that flippant who wants to give me the 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.680
 arrow did not have to make it is friend not 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.600
 I had to do that because I'm dangerous 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.000
 ok let's go here to see if I do not 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.850
 because he has tried more than one 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.510
 once although it has not paid off but 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.000
 there is 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.590
 insisting the thing is achieved to see 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.470
 it sounds to me that there is someone here 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.660
 because it's very strange that nobody is there 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.170
 they have taken everything then the one that had 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.040
 here 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:03:00.000
 It's worth, okay, guys, it killed me. 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:02.940
 Well, this is good, well, let's go 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.210
 on the other does not matter hey it was for 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.850

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.520
 I'm going to try to give you or whatever your 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.090

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.590

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.670

 hours to be able to enter an arena that 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.919
 then they are going to kill me as always 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:25.690
 a sand of 36 players
