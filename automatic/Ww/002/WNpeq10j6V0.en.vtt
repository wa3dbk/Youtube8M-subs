00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210
 3 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.250
 here 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.050
 I want 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.590
 small sample very graphic of something that 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.360
 I must feel what I did 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.240
 main vehicle what 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.220
 is going to be the benchmark of the segment that 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.830
 We'll help we can have 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.479
 Access to a good brand position 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.420
 in this segment 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:44.090
 then we bring a very good offer 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.420
 of the very good car of the vehicle and about 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.420
 all 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:53.229
 August is a car that has a lot 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.229
 versatility and above all 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.579
 as it is normal in all vehicles 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.520
 that we launched in the brand vehicles 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:02.830
 commercial is a vehicle that can be 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.659
 configure according to the needs 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.990
 of the client can be configured from 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.819
 many ways and above all the idea of 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.330
 us with marc is that it be that 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:16.060
 vehicle that will help you as a 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.819
 ally in your business and that you can have 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.140
 everything you need in the car 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:25.079
 these are some characteristics 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.079
 techniques we will review all but 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:33.760
 options a cabin and a high encourage me 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:37.269
 basically 20 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.700
 47 centimeters long and the 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:42.250
 wheelbase is greater with what 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.400
 helps us to gain a greater capacity 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.400
 load 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.879
 and basically these are some of the 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:55.090
 characteristics that we can then 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:57.640
 share and what I told them is 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.080
 very important that all vehicles 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.290
 that are destined 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:06.230
 that flexibility that told them that 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.450
 it is not a unique vehicle that in a 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.050
 option but we can have many 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.050
 possibilities
