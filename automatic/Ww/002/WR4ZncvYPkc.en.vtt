00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
you can just about see through to the

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.940 
you can just about see through to the
other<00:02:26.370> side<00:02:26.810> but<00:02:27.810> you've<00:02:27.930> also<00:02:28.080> got<00:02:28.800> the

options<00:02:29.310> you<00:02:29.400> know<00:02:29.520> putting<00:02:29.790> two<00:02:30.120> fans<00:02:30.750> on

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
options you know putting two fans on

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.600 
options you know putting two fans on
pole<00:02:31.350> with<00:02:31.530> you<00:02:31.620> wanted<00:02:31.830> to<00:02:31.950> because<00:02:32.520> these

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
pole with you wanted to because these

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.760 
pole with you wanted to because these
ones<00:02:32.850> going<00:02:32.970> to<00:02:33.060> push<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:33.420> air<00:02:33.540> through<00:02:33.870> and

ones going to push the air through and

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.490 
ones going to push the air through and
you<00:02:34.920> can't<00:02:35.160> remove<00:02:35.400> them<00:02:35.580> which<00:02:35.700> is<00:02:35.730> a<00:02:35.850> shame

you can't remove them which is a shame

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.250 
you can't remove them which is a shame
but<00:02:37.500> we're<00:02:38.070> going<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:38.340> obviously<00:02:39.230> need<00:02:40.230> to

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
but we're going to obviously need to

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.450 
but we're going to obviously need to
make<00:02:40.440> sure<00:02:40.470> you've<00:02:40.650> got<00:02:40.680> lots<00:02:40.800> of<00:02:41.160> space<00:02:41.400> for

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
make sure you've got lots of space for

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.940 
make sure you've got lots of space for
this<00:02:42.050> so<00:02:43.050> you've<00:02:43.170> got<00:02:43.200> two<00:02:43.410> pumps<00:02:43.710> on<00:02:43.800> this

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
this so you've got two pumps on this

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.800 
this so you've got two pumps on this
we've<00:02:44.130> only<00:02:44.460> usually<00:02:44.700> seen<00:02:45.090> one<00:02:45.300> pump<00:02:45.600> on

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
we've only usually seen one pump on

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.770 
we've only usually seen one pump on
previous<00:02:46.380> all-in-one<00:02:46.830> coolers<00:02:47.660> what<00:02:48.660> you

will<00:02:48.900> need<00:02:49.020> to<00:02:49.080> take<00:02:49.380> note<00:02:49.620> though<00:02:49.800> is<00:02:49.830> because

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
will need to take note though is because

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.210 
will need to take note though is because
there's<00:02:50.580> two<00:02:51.570> smaller<00:02:51.990> tanks<00:02:52.410> on<00:02:52.530> this<00:02:52.710> rather

you've<00:03:53.970> got<00:03:54.000> a<00:03:54.150> nice<00:03:54.300> lot<00:03:54.570> of<00:03:54.600> maneuverability

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
you've got a nice lot of maneuverability

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.000 
you've got a nice lot of maneuverability
it's<00:03:56.010> also<00:03:56.160> very<00:03:56.310> flexible<00:03:56.910> as<00:03:57.000> well<00:03:57.470> so<00:03:58.470> ya

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
it's also very flexible as well so ya

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.060 
it's also very flexible as well so ya
know<00:03:59.250> it's<00:03:59.520> an<00:03:59.580> easy<00:03:59.730> to<00:04:00.560> move<00:04:01.560> around<00:04:01.710> in<00:04:02.040> the

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
know it's an easy to move around in the

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.330 
know it's an easy to move around in the
case<00:04:02.340> as<00:04:02.520> well<00:04:03.380> what<00:04:04.380> else<00:04:04.620> do<00:04:04.800> we<00:04:04.860> need<00:04:05.010> to<00:04:05.070> say

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
case as well what else do we need to say

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.450 
case as well what else do we need to say
so<00:04:05.730> I<00:04:06.060> saw<00:04:06.990> look<00:04:07.170> at<00:04:07.320> the<00:04:07.410> cables<00:04:07.800> are<00:04:07.950> included

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:08.460 
so I saw look at the cables are included

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.350 
so I saw look at the cables are included
and<00:04:09.020> stuck<00:04:10.020> on<00:04:10.170> this<00:04:10.380> so<00:04:11.040> the<00:04:11.730> main<00:04:12.060> power

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
and stuck on this so the main power

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.250 
and stuck on this so the main power
comes<00:04:12.810> to<00:04:13.790> 13<00:04:14.790> pin<00:04:15.090> which<00:04:15.330> trying<00:04:15.600> to<00:04:15.690> find<00:04:16.049> it

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
comes to 13 pin which trying to find it

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.039 
comes to 13 pin which trying to find it
errors

software on the bottom you've got the

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.760 
software on the bottom you've got the
copper<00:04:47.949> cold<00:04:48.220> plate<00:04:48.460> aka<00:04:49.030> walk<00:04:49.360> block<00:04:49.770> and

copper cold plate aka walk block and

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.830 
copper cold plate aka walk block and
then<00:04:51.580> that's<00:04:51.819> got<00:04:51.969> some<00:04:52.150> pre<00:04:52.300> apply<00:04:52.539> then

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
then that's got some pre apply then

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.469 
then that's got some pre apply then
we'll<00:04:53.020> paste<00:04:53.319> on<00:04:53.530> it<00:04:53.680> as<00:04:53.800> well<00:04:54.069> a<00:04:54.460> few<00:04:55.180> grooves

we'll paste on it as well a few grooves

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:57.330 
we'll paste on it as well a few grooves
on<00:04:55.629> the<00:04:55.659> side<00:04:55.990> where<00:04:56.259> the<00:04:56.409> brackets<00:04:56.889> will<00:04:57.069> go

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
on the side where the brackets will go

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.950 
on the side where the brackets will go
into<00:04:57.490> place<00:04:59.039> um<00:05:00.039> but<00:05:01.030> yeah<00:05:01.240> it's<00:05:01.539> a<00:05:01.629> shame<00:05:01.840> you

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
into place um but yeah it's a shame you

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.309 
into place um but yeah it's a shame you
can't<00:05:02.050> take<00:05:02.229> these<00:05:02.349> fans<00:05:02.590> out<00:05:02.800> um<00:05:03.009> but<00:05:04.319> it's

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:05.319 
can't take these fans out um but it's

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:07.170 
can't take these fans out um but it's
maybe<00:05:06.190> something<00:05:06.639> that<00:05:06.789> could<00:05:06.909> be<00:05:06.940> done<00:05:07.000> in

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
maybe something that could be done in

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.510 
maybe something that could be done in
the<00:05:07.330> future<00:05:07.449> but<00:05:08.440> it's<00:05:08.530> a<00:05:08.620> very<00:05:08.650> definitely

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
the future but it's a very definitely

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.330 
the future but it's a very definitely
unique<00:05:10.259> design<00:05:11.259> we<00:05:11.650> have<00:05:11.770> really<00:05:11.949> seen<00:05:12.129> much

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
unique design we have really seen much

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.670 
unique design we have really seen much
of<00:05:12.840> but<00:05:13.840> before<00:05:13.960> you<00:05:14.349> will<00:05:14.469> be<00:05:14.590> up<00:05:14.650> very

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
shortly and it's going to be interesting

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.550 
shortly and it's going to be interesting
to<00:05:18.789> see<00:05:18.879> this<00:05:19.060> actually<00:05:19.509> because<00:05:19.840> we<00:05:20.469> have

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
to see this actually because we have

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.950 
to see this actually because we have
seen<00:05:20.770> is<00:05:20.889> designed<00:05:21.159> before<00:05:21.250> and<00:05:21.960> be

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
seen is designed before and be

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.990 
seen is designed before and be
interesting<00:05:23.380> to<00:05:23.469> see<00:05:23.590> how<00:05:23.770> it<00:05:23.889> turns<00:05:24.699> out<00:05:24.880> with

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
interesting to see how it turns out with

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.950 
interesting to see how it turns out with
the<00:05:25.060> results<00:05:25.919> through<00:05:26.919> yes<00:05:27.190> very<00:05:27.849> nice<00:05:28.029> a<00:05:28.479> lag
