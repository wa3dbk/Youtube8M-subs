so<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.400> quick<00:00:17.610> fix<00:00:17.849> is<00:00:18.180> door<00:00:18.750> down<00:00:18.900> so<00:00:19.110> that's

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:19.290 
so the quick fix is door down so that's

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.930 
so the quick fix is door down so that's
what<00:00:19.439> we're<00:00:19.560> doing<00:00:19.770> today<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.189> we<00:00:20.699> thought<00:00:20.880> it

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:20.940 
what we're doing today and we thought it

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.010 
what we're doing today and we thought it
would<00:00:21.000> be<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.150> good<00:00:21.270> time<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.480> grab<00:00:21.690> the<00:00:21.779> camera

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
would be a good time to grab the camera

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.560 
would be a good time to grab the camera
since<00:00:22.890> you<00:00:23.460> know<00:00:23.550> this<00:00:24.150> is<00:00:24.180> not<00:00:24.359> something

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
since you know this is not something

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.570 
since you know this is not something
that<00:00:24.689> people<00:00:24.990> do<00:00:25.109> every<00:00:25.260> day<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.800> kind<00:00:26.520> of

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
that people do every day and kind of

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.000 
that people do every day and kind of
walk<00:00:26.760> through<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.090> together<00:00:27.560> so<00:00:28.560> this<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:28.890> what

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
walk through it together so this is what

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.279 
walk through it together so this is what
we're<00:00:29.130> doing<00:00:29.369> these<00:00:30.150> doorknobs<00:00:30.390> came<00:00:31.080> on<00:00:31.199> the

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
we're doing these doorknobs came on the

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.750 
we're doing these doorknobs came on the
house<00:00:31.439> when<00:00:31.650> we<00:00:31.680> got<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.430> we<00:00:32.489> want<00:00:32.699> to

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:32.760 
house when we got it and we want to

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.340 
house when we got it and we want to
switch<00:00:32.910> them<00:00:33.059> out<00:00:33.180> so<00:00:33.449> we<00:00:33.570> went<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.809> true<00:00:34.050> value

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
switch them out so we went to true value

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.209 
switch them out so we went to true value
and<00:00:34.530> got<00:00:34.680> these<00:00:34.949> oil<00:00:35.340> rubbed<00:00:35.670> bronze

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:39.440 
and got these oil rubbed bronze
doorknobs<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.460> it's<00:00:38.640> just<00:00:38.820> privacy<00:00:39.329> it's

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
doorknobs and it's just privacy it's

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.720 
doorknobs and it's just privacy it's
made<00:00:39.660> for<00:00:39.840> bedroom<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.469> bath<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.550> kind<00:00:41.700> of

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
made for bedroom and bath so it kind of

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.010 
made for bedroom and bath so it kind of
has<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.880> lock<00:00:42.090> on<00:00:42.120> one<00:00:42.420> side<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.840> out<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:42.930> other

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
has a lock on one side and out the other

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.560 
has a lock on one side and out the other
side<00:00:43.200> first<00:00:43.950> step<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.579> get<00:00:44.700> this<00:00:44.969> bad<00:00:45.329> boy

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
side first step is to get this bad boy

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.590 
side first step is to get this bad boy
off<00:00:45.840> here<00:00:46.290> and<00:00:46.440> on<00:00:47.160> this<00:00:47.460> side<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:47.760> know<00:00:48.030> we

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
off here and on this side I know we

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.940 
off here and on this side I know we
don't<00:00:48.719> have<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.020> greatest<00:00:49.200> angle<00:00:49.590> here<00:00:49.739> but

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
don't have the greatest angle here but

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.670 
don't have the greatest angle here but
there's<00:00:50.489> two<00:00:50.789> Phillips<00:00:51.570> head<00:00:51.660> screws<00:00:52.230> just

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
there's two Phillips head screws just

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.830 
there's two Phillips head screws just
holding<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.039> on<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.360> would<00:00:54.480> be<00:00:54.510> step

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
holding this on so that would be step

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.900 
holding this on so that would be step
one<00:00:54.870> we're<00:00:55.410> just<00:00:55.500> going<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.739> we're<00:00:56.670> just<00:00:56.730> going

one<00:01:56.369> in<00:01:57.060> an<00:01:57.180> hour<00:01:57.329> equals<00:01:57.600> case<00:01:57.810> it's<00:01:58.049> oil

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
one in an hour equals case it's oil

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.380 
one in an hour equals case it's oil
rubbed<00:01:58.740> bronze<00:01:59.070> and<00:02:00.950> remember<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.100> face<00:02:02.909> the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
rubbed bronze and remember to face the

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.179 
rubbed bronze and remember to face the
new<00:02:03.540> latch<00:02:03.719> bolt<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.229> same<00:02:04.439> direction<00:02:04.710> as<00:02:05.130> the

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
new latch bolt the same direction as the

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.410 
new latch bolt the same direction as the
olin

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
olin

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:17.490 
olin
so<00:02:07.659> it<00:02:08.080> actually<00:02:08.229> works<00:02:08.649> properly<00:02:09.899> alright<00:02:16.500> so

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
so it actually works properly alright so

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.680 
so it actually works properly alright so

there's you can tell if you line it up

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.790 
there's you can tell if you line it up
here<00:02:37.180> that<00:02:37.300> it<00:02:37.390> fits<00:02:37.599> in<00:02:37.780> perfectly<00:02:38.200> and<00:02:38.530> and

here that it fits in perfectly and and
uh<00:02:38.910> this<00:02:39.910> this<00:02:41.130> latch<00:02:42.480> bolt<00:02:43.480> actually<00:02:44.140> if<00:02:44.319> you

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
uh this this latch bolt actually if you

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.039 
uh this this latch bolt actually if you
push<00:02:44.650> it<00:02:44.800> in<00:02:44.950> it<00:02:45.819> slides<00:02:46.090> in<00:02:46.299> very<00:02:46.480> easily<00:02:46.540> and

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
push it in it slides in very easily and

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:48.600 
push it in it slides in very easily and
easily<00:02:47.650> in<00:02:47.739> these<00:02:47.890> two<00:02:48.069> bolts<00:02:48.250> right<00:02:48.549> here

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
easily in these two bolts right here

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.539 
easily in these two bolts right here
will<00:02:48.970> fit<00:02:49.180> right<00:02:49.209> into<00:02:49.810> place<00:02:50.170> so<00:02:50.950> this<00:02:51.459> is

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
will fit right into place so this is

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.850 
will fit right into place so this is
what<00:02:51.640> we're<00:02:51.760> doing<00:02:51.910> we<00:02:52.030> push<00:02:52.239> this<00:02:52.450> in<00:02:52.860> we

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
what we're doing we push this in we

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.470 
what we're doing we push this in we
lined<00:02:54.069> up<00:02:54.190> that<00:02:54.519> you<00:02:54.640> can<00:02:54.819> tell<00:02:55.030> by<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.209> shape

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
lined up that you can tell by the shape

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.059 
lined up that you can tell by the shape
of<00:02:55.690> it<00:02:55.780> in<00:02:55.870> here<00:02:55.989> you<00:02:56.049> go<00:02:56.140> out<00:02:56.200> of<00:02:56.380> shape<00:02:56.590> push

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
of it in here you go out of shape push

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.940 
of it in here you go out of shape push
it<00:02:57.190> through<00:02:57.989> and<00:02:58.989> it<00:02:59.049> goes<00:02:59.200> could<00:02:59.410> easily<00:02:59.769> like

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
it through and it goes could easily like

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.190 
it through and it goes could easily like
that<00:03:00.160> now<00:03:00.819> this<00:03:01.030> guy<00:03:01.239> is<00:03:01.299> going<00:03:01.480> to<00:03:01.569> go<00:03:01.720> on<00:03:01.930> and

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
that now this guy is going to go on and

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.600 
that now this guy is going to go on and
here's<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.620> trick<00:03:02.890> I<00:03:03.100> don't<00:03:03.280> know<00:03:03.340> if<00:03:03.400> you<00:03:03.459> can

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
here's the trick I don't know if you can

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.400 
here's the trick I don't know if you can
see<00:03:03.790> there<00:03:04.000> but<00:03:04.239> there's<00:03:04.870> a<00:03:04.959> little<00:03:05.230> bitty

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
see there but there's a little bitty

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.350 
see there but there's a little bitty
piece<00:03:05.709> in<00:03:06.010> there<00:03:06.190> that<00:03:06.400> kind<00:03:06.640> of<00:03:06.700> turns<00:03:06.970> around

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
piece in there that kind of turns around

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.800 
piece in there that kind of turns around
this<00:03:08.170> knob<00:03:08.610> you<00:03:09.610> can<00:03:09.790> see<00:03:10.060> the<00:03:10.209> shape<00:03:10.450> of<00:03:10.690> this

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
this knob you can see the shape of this

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.410 
this knob you can see the shape of this
way<00:03:11.019> the<00:03:11.170> shape<00:03:11.350> is<00:03:11.709> horizontal<00:03:12.519> so<00:03:13.120> what<00:03:13.269> I<00:03:13.299> do

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
way the shape is horizontal so what I do

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.319 
way the shape is horizontal so what I do
is<00:03:13.570> I<00:03:13.840> find<00:03:14.109> it<00:03:14.320> and<00:03:14.410> i<00:03:14.440> get<00:03:14.500> it<00:03:14.620> horizontal

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
is I find it and i get it horizontal

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.400 
is I find it and i get it horizontal
once<00:03:16.329> you<00:03:16.390> get<00:03:16.510> a<00:03:16.540> horizontal<00:03:17.019> you<00:03:17.079> put<00:03:17.260> your

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
once you get a horizontal you put your

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.630 
once you get a horizontal you put your
finger<00:03:17.530> on<00:03:17.680> here<00:03:17.859> and<00:03:17.950> hold<00:03:18.070> it<00:03:18.250> in<00:03:18.280> place<00:03:18.430> so

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
finger on here and hold it in place so

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.630 
finger on here and hold it in place so
it's<00:03:18.820> not<00:03:18.910> sliding<00:03:19.510> all<00:03:19.720> around<00:03:20.459> line<00:03:21.459> up<00:03:21.609> the

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
it's not sliding all around line up the

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.849 
it's not sliding all around line up the
shape<00:03:21.970> you<00:03:22.150> can<00:03:22.299> see<00:03:22.510> this<00:03:22.690> half<00:03:23.140> moon<00:03:23.500> looking

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
shape you can see this half moon looking

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:26.880 
shape you can see this half moon looking
thing<00:03:24.239> is<00:03:25.239> also<00:03:25.480> a<00:03:25.630> Halfmoon<00:03:25.989> looking<00:03:26.739> thing

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
thing is also a Halfmoon looking thing

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.410 
thing is also a Halfmoon looking thing
in<00:03:27.010> here<00:03:27.190> you<00:03:27.310> just<00:03:27.400> wide<00:03:27.609> enough<00:03:27.880> shapes<00:03:28.150> get

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
in here you just wide enough shapes get

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.300 
in here you just wide enough shapes get
the<00:03:28.510> Halfmoon<00:03:28.799> get<00:03:29.799> this<00:03:29.980> thing<00:03:30.160> in<00:03:30.250> the

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
the Halfmoon get this thing in the

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.620 
the Halfmoon get this thing in the
middle<00:03:30.430> to<00:03:30.640> hold<00:03:30.850> still<00:03:31.090> so<00:03:31.359> it's<00:03:31.480> not

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
middle to hold still so it's not

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.910 
middle to hold still so it's not
wiggling<00:03:31.959> all<00:03:32.200> around<00:03:32.970> one<00:03:33.970> of<00:03:34.060> the<00:03:34.180> shapes<00:03:34.420> I

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
wiggling all around one of the shapes I

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.009 
wiggling all around one of the shapes I
don't<00:03:35.920> have<00:03:36.100> moon<00:03:36.310> it<00:03:36.489> fits<00:03:36.700> perfectly<00:03:36.760> on<00:03:37.299> now

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
don't have moon it fits perfectly on now

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.930 
don't have moon it fits perfectly on now
right<00:03:38.350> now<00:03:38.560> it's<00:03:38.980> not<00:03:39.130> turning<00:03:39.430> because<00:03:39.640> it's

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
right now it's not turning because it's

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.800 
right now it's not turning because it's
locked<00:03:40.180> but<00:03:40.390> if<00:03:40.480> you<00:03:40.570> unlock<00:03:40.959> this<00:03:41.019> guy<00:03:42.810> so

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
locked but if you unlock this guy so

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.330 
locked but if you unlock this guy so
that's<00:03:44.790> that<00:03:45.790> is<00:03:46.060> the

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
that's that is the
