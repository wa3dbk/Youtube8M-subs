00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:06.240
 Gentlemen, I'm going to test the 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.300
 antenna we are already with a television 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.060
 High Definition 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.280
 and good plant is placed of this 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:15.980
 form is placed directly with a 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.100
 Coaxial cable is the antenna that we made 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.529
 I the small part behind my television 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.090
 because there is perfect, there is no 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.500
 can put in a window so that 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:29.120
 have a better signal but it works 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.550
 you usually put him 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.140
 you put the sticker on it and it stays stuck 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.230
 back there 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.180
 well let's change channels 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:43.610

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.860
