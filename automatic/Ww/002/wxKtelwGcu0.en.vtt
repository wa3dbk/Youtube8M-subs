00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
of the basic definitions out the way

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.609 
of the basic definitions out the way
there<00:00:18.449> are<00:00:18.510> only<00:00:18.539> two<00:00:18.930> types<00:00:19.170> of<00:00:19.380> stock

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
market the way it works is each put and

price however the option contracts are
way<00:00:35.700> more<00:00:35.730> cheaper<00:00:36.540> than<00:00:36.780> buying<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.230> stock

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
so B you see why I think was trading for

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.330 
so B you see why I think was trading for
around<00:00:54.180> 70<00:00:54.570> dollars<00:00:54.960> back<00:00:55.199> then<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:56.010> to

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
around 70 dollars back then and so to

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.450 
around 70 dollars back then and so to
buy<00:00:56.550> 200<00:00:57.239> shares<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:58.350> seventy<00:00:58.890> dollar<00:00:59.070> stock

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
buy 200 shares of a seventy dollar stock

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.250 
buy 200 shares of a seventy dollar stock
it<00:00:59.760> would<00:00:59.879> have<00:00:59.969> cost<00:01:00.239> me<00:01:00.359> more<00:01:00.660> than<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:01.050> four

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
it would have cost me more than the four

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.229 
it would have cost me more than the four
hundred<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.590> sixty<00:01:01.800> four<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.579> invested<00:01:03.120> right

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
hundred and sixty four I invested right

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.420 
hundred and sixty four I invested right
here<00:01:03.600> however<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:04.140> bought<00:01:04.409> two<00:01:04.619> contracts<00:01:05.159> and

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
here however I bought two contracts and

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.039 
here however I bought two contracts and
so<00:01:05.640> those<00:01:05.909> two<00:01:06.090> contracts<00:01:06.570> allow<00:01:06.750> me<00:01:06.960> to

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
so those two contracts allow me to

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.230 
so those two contracts allow me to
control<00:01:07.740> 200<00:01:08.310> shares<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.700> stock<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.150> only

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
control 200 shares of stock and it only

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.460 
control 200 shares of stock and it only
cost<00:01:09.510> me<00:01:09.659> four<00:01:09.840> hundred<00:01:09.900> sixty<00:01:10.290> four<00:01:10.409> dollars

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
cost me four hundred sixty four dollars

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.020 
cost me four hundred sixty four dollars
and<00:01:10.979> as<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.189> can<00:01:11.280> see<00:01:11.430> here<00:01:11.580> are<00:01:11.670> invested

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
and as you can see here are invested

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.060 
and as you can see here are invested
four<00:01:12.240> sixty<00:01:12.600> four<00:01:12.869> when<00:01:13.260> all<00:01:13.380> said<00:01:13.710> done<00:01:13.740> I

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
four sixty four when all said done I

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.249 
four sixty four when all said done I
closed<00:01:14.280> out<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.549> trade<00:01:14.820> for<00:01:15.450> sixteen<00:01:15.840> hundred

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
closed out the trade for sixteen hundred

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.320 
closed out the trade for sixteen hundred
and<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:16.740> this<00:01:17.040> produced<00:01:17.580> about<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:17.939> two<00:01:18.180> hundred

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
and so this produced about a two hundred

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.999 
and so this produced about a two hundred
and<00:01:18.600> sixty-nine<00:01:19.140> percent<00:01:19.500> return<00:01:19.979> on

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
and sixty-nine percent return on

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.380 
and sixty-nine percent return on
investment<00:01:20.460> in<00:01:20.520> roughly<00:01:20.759> seven<00:01:21.090> days<00:01:21.240> and

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
investment in roughly seven days and

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.539 
investment in roughly seven days and
that's<00:01:21.540> excluding<00:01:22.229> commissions<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.280> here's

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
that's excluding commissions so here's

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.640 
that's excluding commissions so here's
another<00:01:23.820> example<00:01:24.030> here's<00:01:24.840> Apple<00:01:25.350> this<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:25.619> a

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
another example here's Apple this is a

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.800 
another example here's Apple this is a
call<00:01:25.950> option<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.549> call<00:01:27.180> options<00:01:27.600> allow<00:01:27.750> you

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
call option and call options allow you

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.359 
call option and call options allow you
to<00:01:27.869> make<00:01:28.020> money<00:01:28.170> when<00:01:28.380> stocks<00:01:28.650> rise<00:01:28.920> in<00:01:29.130> price

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
to make money when stocks rise in price

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.370 
to make money when stocks rise in price
and<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.759> bought<00:01:30.090> two<00:01:30.119> contracts<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:30.990> Apple

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380

Apple of July 100 call option gave me

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.679 
Apple of July 100 call option gave me
control<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.220> hundred<00:01:35.610> shares<00:01:35.850> or<00:01:36.270> excuse<00:01:36.570> me

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
control of a hundred shares or excuse me

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.690

two<00:01:36.900> hundred<00:01:37.049> shares<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.560> Apple<00:01:37.770> but<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.549> only

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
two hundred shares of Apple but it only

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.460 
two hundred shares of Apple but it only
cost<00:01:38.939> me<00:01:39.030> thirteen<00:01:39.450> hundred<00:01:39.659> dollars<00:01:39.930> and

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
cost me thirteen hundred dollars and

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.780 
cost me thirteen hundred dollars and
when<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.619> close<00:01:40.829> out<00:01:40.979> this<00:01:41.100> trade<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.400> close<00:01:41.670> it

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
when I close out this trade I close it

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.730 
when I close out this trade I close it
out<00:01:41.850> for<00:01:42.030> forty<00:01:42.360> four<00:01:42.540> hundred<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.530> this

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
out for forty four hundred and so this

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.200 
out for forty four hundred and so this
represented<00:01:44.340> about<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.549> two<00:01:44.790> hundred<00:01:44.909> and

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
represented about a two hundred and

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.840 
represented about a two hundred and
forty<00:01:45.810> six<00:01:46.020> percent<00:01:46.740> return<00:01:47.220> investment<00:01:47.430> and

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
forty six percent return investment and

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.120 
forty six percent return investment and
roughly<00:01:48.360> sixteen<00:01:48.810> days<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.560> we'll<00:01:49.770> pull

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
roughly sixteen days and so we'll pull

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.649 
roughly sixteen days and so we'll pull
up<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.250> stock<00:01:50.549> chart<00:01:50.640> here<00:01:50.909> in<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.060> second<00:01:51.450> but

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
up the stock chart here in a second but

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.719 
up the stock chart here in a second but
just<00:01:51.930> think<00:01:52.200> about<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:53.220> buy<00:01:53.399> too<00:01:53.460> many

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
just think about that to buy too many

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.039 
just think about that to buy too many
shares<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.119> Apple<00:01:54.329> at<00:01:54.570> about<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.840> hundred

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
shares of Apple at about a hundred

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.109 
shares of Apple at about a hundred
dollars<00:01:55.560> would<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:55.920> cost<00:01:56.100> me<00:01:56.310> way<00:01:56.490> more<00:01:56.520> than

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
dollars would it cost me way more than

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.149 
dollars would it cost me way more than
thirteen<00:01:57.840> hundred<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:58.200> invested<00:01:58.649> here<00:01:58.740> however

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
thirteen hundred I invested here however

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.399 
thirteen hundred I invested here however
I<00:01:59.430> still<00:01:59.969> was<00:02:00.149> able<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.570> participate<00:02:00.899> the

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
I still was able to participate the

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.889 
I still was able to participate the
upward<00:02:01.740> movement<00:02:01.890> of<00:02:02.159> Apple<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.640> stock<00:02:02.909> by

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
upward movement of Apple the stock by

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.569 
upward movement of Apple the stock by
buying<00:02:04.140> these<00:02:04.259> call<00:02:04.500> options<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.250> did<00:02:05.490> it

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
buying these call options and I did it

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.310 
buying these call options and I did it
for<00:02:05.610> lower<00:02:06.060> price<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.600> so<00:02:07.020> that's<00:02:07.170> what<00:02:07.259> I

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
for lower price and so that's what I

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.869 
for lower price and so that's what I
mean<00:02:07.469> by<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.649> leverage<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.250> know<00:02:08.429> so<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:08.700> only

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
mean by the leverage you know so I only

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.089 
mean by the leverage you know so I only
invest<00:02:09.149> at<00:02:09.330> thirteen<00:02:09.629> hundred<00:02:09.899> but<00:02:10.110> sometimes

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
invest at thirteen hundred but sometimes

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.040 
invest at thirteen hundred but sometimes
that<00:02:11.520> depending<00:02:12.000> on<00:02:12.090> which<00:02:12.209> option<00:02:12.450> contract

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
that depending on which option contract

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.490 
that depending on which option contract
you

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
you

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.260 
you
it<00:02:13.800> can<00:02:14.160> move<00:02:14.310> dollar-for-dollar<00:02:14.790> with<00:02:15.180> the

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
it can move dollar-for-dollar with the

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.660 
it can move dollar-for-dollar with the
stock<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:15.810> so<00:02:16.290> if<00:02:16.440> Apple<00:02:16.860> moves<00:02:17.100> up<00:02:17.280> in<00:02:17.460> price

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
stock and so if Apple moves up in price

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.260 
stock and so if Apple moves up in price
$5<00:02:18.540> now<00:02:19.230> I'm<00:02:19.470> making<00:02:19.710> you<00:02:20.220> know<00:02:20.430> five<00:02:20.760> dollars

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
$5 now I'm making you know five dollars

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.320 
$5 now I'm making you know five dollars
on<00:02:21.510> a<00:02:21.860> $1,300<00:02:22.860> investment<00:02:23.460> compared<00:02:24.210> to

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
on a $1,300 investment compared to

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.790 
on a $1,300 investment compared to
making<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:24.810> five<00:02:25.020> dollar<00:02:25.260> profit

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
making a five dollar profit

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.500 
making a five dollar profit
on<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.040> twenty<00:02:26.580> thousand<00:02:27.090> dollar<00:02:27.300> investment

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
on a twenty thousand dollar investment

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.930 
on a twenty thousand dollar investment
so<00:02:28.410> that's<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.770> leverage<00:02:29.070> aspect<00:02:29.520> in<00:02:29.640> how<00:02:29.790> it

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
so that's the leverage aspect in how it

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.000 
so that's the leverage aspect in how it

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
that is down in and so just think about

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.460 
that is down in and so just think about
the<00:04:17.580> stock<00:04:17.820> the<00:04:17.970> same<00:04:18.209> way<00:04:18.390> that<00:04:18.900> contract

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
the stock the same way that contract

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.080 
the stock the same way that contract
gave<00:04:19.680> me<00:04:19.769> the<00:04:19.859> right<00:04:20.040> to<00:04:20.220> sell<00:04:20.489> this<00:04:20.669> stock<00:04:20.880> at

gave me the right to sell this stock at

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.909 
gave me the right to sell this stock at
a<00:04:21.150> higher<00:04:21.330> price<00:04:21.660> so<00:04:21.960> what<00:04:22.440> it<00:04:22.500> was<00:04:22.620> current

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
a higher price so what it was current

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.830 
a higher price so what it was current
currently<00:04:23.490> trading<00:04:23.729> at<00:04:23.880> down<00:04:24.090> here<00:04:24.419> and<00:04:24.600> so

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
currently trading at down here and so

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.240 
currently trading at down here and so
that<00:04:25.020> makes<00:04:25.200> the<00:04:25.320> contract<00:04:25.740> more<00:04:25.890> valuable

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
that makes the contract more valuable

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.140 
that makes the contract more valuable
because<00:04:26.700> if<00:04:26.820> you

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
because if you

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.379 
because if you
the<00:04:27.330> home<00:04:27.540> that<00:04:28.139> was<00:04:28.229> only<00:04:28.410> worth<00:04:28.650> 50<00:04:29.160> grand

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
the home that was only worth 50 grand

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:31.670 
the home that was only worth 50 grand

flip-flop we had a contract that says we
can<00:04:55.770> buy<00:04:55.919> a<00:04:55.949> hundred<00:04:56.400> grand<00:04:56.669> house<00:04:57.000> for<00:04:57.690> 50

thousand all right so this call option
gave<00:05:00.270> me<00:05:00.360> the<00:05:00.449> right<00:05:00.600> to<00:05:00.990> buy<00:05:01.260> Apple<00:05:01.500> at<00:05:01.979> this

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
gave me the right to buy Apple at this

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.340 
gave me the right to buy Apple at this
lower<00:05:02.639> price<00:05:02.910> even<00:05:03.330> though<00:05:03.510> Apple<00:05:03.840> started

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
lower price even though Apple started

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.620 
lower price even though Apple started
trading<00:05:04.530> up<00:05:04.770> higher<00:05:05.039> and<00:05:05.340> so<00:05:05.880> that<00:05:06.060> contract

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
trading up higher and so that contract

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.270 
trading up higher and so that contract
gave<00:05:06.810> me<00:05:06.930> the<00:05:07.020> right<00:05:07.199> to<00:05:07.229> buy<00:05:07.650> something<00:05:08.130> for

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
gave me the right to buy something for

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.189 
gave me the right to buy something for
cheaper<00:05:08.760> than<00:05:08.910> it<00:05:09.030> was<00:05:09.120> actually<00:05:09.539> selling<00:05:09.840> and

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 
cheaper than it was actually selling and

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:12.980 
cheaper than it was actually selling and
so<00:05:10.710> that<00:05:10.949> makes<00:05:11.220> the<00:05:11.400> contract<00:05:11.940> more<00:05:12.300> valuable

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
so that makes the contract more valuable

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.740 
so that makes the contract more valuable
now<00:05:13.590> what<00:05:13.800> makes<00:05:13.979> stock<00:05:14.250> options<00:05:14.669> so<00:05:15.180> special

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
now what makes stock options so special

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.589 
now what makes stock options so special
is<00:05:15.870> that<00:05:15.979> these<00:05:16.979> contracts<00:05:17.520> can<00:05:17.760> be<00:05:17.789> traded<00:05:18.210> on

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:18.599 
is that these contracts can be traded on

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:20.810 
is that these contracts can be traded on
the<00:05:18.660> options<00:05:19.620> market<00:05:19.770> just<00:05:20.070> like<00:05:20.250> stocks<00:05:20.580> are

bought and sold in the stock market and
option<00:05:23.070> trading<00:05:23.250> is<00:05:23.430> generally<00:05:23.820> riskier<00:05:24.449> than
