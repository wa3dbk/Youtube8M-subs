00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
cherries and you can go there by well by

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.069 
cherries and you can go there by well by

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:32.079 
going to a bunch of cherries com or a

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.840 
going to a bunch of cherries com or a

bunch of cherries dot blogspot com and

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.490 
bunch of cherries dot blogspot com and
well<00:00:36.850> I<00:00:36.879> basically<00:00:37.660> started<00:00:37.930> the<00:00:38.260> page

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
well I basically started the page

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.229 
well I basically started the page
because<00:00:39.100> the<00:00:39.340> current<00:00:39.879> gallery<00:00:40.359> has<00:00:41.350> over<00:00:42.239> 350

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
because the current gallery has over 350

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.079 
because the current gallery has over 350
pictures<00:00:44.109> loaded<00:00:44.620> and<00:00:44.800> it<00:00:45.010> has<00:00:45.190> become<00:00:45.940> quite

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:46.089 
pictures loaded and it has become quite

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:48.029 
pictures loaded and it has become quite
inefficient<00:00:46.539> I<00:00:47.019> mean<00:00:47.260> you<00:00:47.379> have<00:00:47.559> to<00:00:47.710> scroll

00:00:48.029 --> 00:00:48.039 
inefficient I mean you have to scroll

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:51.750 
inefficient I mean you have to scroll
down<00:00:48.420> pages<00:00:49.420> after<00:00:49.679> pages<00:00:50.679> to<00:00:50.920> look<00:00:51.190> for<00:00:51.579> a

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
down pages after pages to look for a

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.709 
down pages after pages to look for a
card<00:00:52.269> and<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.949> is<00:00:54.069> also<00:00:54.339> difficult<00:00:54.579> to<00:00:55.329> find

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:55.719 
card and it is also difficult to find

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.549 
card and it is also difficult to find
projects<00:00:56.350> of<00:00:56.530> a<00:00:56.799> specific<00:00:57.219> team<00:00:58.089> and<00:00:58.569> so<00:00:59.530> I

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
projects of a specific team and so I

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.709 
projects of a specific team and so I
decided<00:01:00.010> that<00:01:00.129> I<00:01:00.309> should<00:01:00.429> just<00:01:00.879> start<00:01:01.209> a<00:01:01.389> new

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
decided that I should just start a new

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.130 
decided that I should just start a new
page<00:01:02.139> for<00:01:02.530> a<00:01:02.679> new<00:01:02.920> gallery<00:01:03.190> so<00:01:03.999> let<00:01:04.659> me<00:01:04.839> show

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:04.069 
recommend using the label feature over

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:06.339 
recommend using the label feature over
here<00:05:04.400> because<00:05:04.639> it<00:05:05.270> doesn't<00:05:05.720> work<00:05:05.870> very<00:05:05.900> well

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:06.349 
here because it doesn't work very well

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:08.830 
here because it doesn't work very well
in<00:05:06.800> fact<00:05:07.250> it<00:05:07.460> doesn't<00:05:07.610> load<00:05:07.909> up<00:05:08.090> all<00:05:08.210> the<00:05:08.449> cards

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
in fact it doesn't load up all the cards

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.909 
in fact it doesn't load up all the cards
with<00:05:09.289> the<00:05:09.470> correct<00:05:09.830> labels<00:05:10.610> so<00:05:11.419> instead<00:05:12.380> use

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
with the correct labels so instead use

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:16.439 
with the correct labels so instead use
the<00:05:13.190> label<00:05:13.520> tool<00:05:13.789> from<00:05:14.180> the<00:05:14.240> right<00:05:14.659> menu<00:05:15.110> bar

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:16.449 
the label tool from the right menu bar

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:18.909 
the label tool from the right menu bar
so<00:05:17.449> at<00:05:17.569> the<00:05:17.690> time<00:05:17.840> of<00:05:18.020> this<00:05:18.139> video<00:05:18.349> they<00:05:18.830> are

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 
so at the time of this video they are

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:23.320 
so at the time of this video they are
