00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
a great defense bonus although it I

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.490 
a great defense bonus although it I
limits<00:01:19.680> their<00:01:19.890> maneuverability<00:01:20.750> so<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.439> I

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
limits their maneuverability so and I

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.929 
limits their maneuverability so and I
also<00:01:22.650> knew<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.009> computer<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.490> put<00:01:23.820> them

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
also knew that the computer I put them

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.730 
also knew that the computer I put them
on<00:01:24.060> hard<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.170> knew<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.320> they<00:01:25.470> would<00:01:25.590> act

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
on hard so I knew that they would act

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.679 
on hard so I knew that they would act
aggressively<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.580> basically<00:01:27.119> go<00:01:27.390> for<00:01:27.570> my

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
aggressively and basically go for my

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.050 
aggressively and basically go for my
weak<00:01:27.840> center<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:29.460> now<00:01:29.490> I'm<00:01:29.820> quickly

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
weak center and so now I'm quickly

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.310 
weak center and so now I'm quickly
moving<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.600> flanks<00:01:30.930> with<00:01:30.960> some<00:01:31.170> different

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.870 
so they're going to give it to these
guys<00:03:15.580> that<00:03:15.840> Gallic<00:03:16.840> style<00:03:17.140> and<00:03:17.950> that<00:03:18.340> causes<00:03:18.580> a

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
guys that Gallic style and that causes a

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.520 
guys that Gallic style and that causes a
panic<00:03:19.270> in<00:03:19.390> the<00:03:19.480> Roman<00:03:19.720> troops<00:03:19.930> and<00:03:20.230> that<00:03:20.410> is

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
panic in the Roman troops and that is

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.440 
panic in the Roman troops and that is
not<00:03:20.650> easy<00:03:20.830> to<00:03:21.010> do<00:03:21.130> on<00:03:21.190> this<00:03:21.370> game<00:03:21.610> because<00:03:22.060> they

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
not easy to do on this game because they

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.050 
not easy to do on this game because they
morale<00:03:22.720> is<00:03:22.960> much<00:03:23.170> much<00:03:23.890> stronger<00:03:24.190> so<00:03:25.030> that

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
morale is much much stronger so that

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.580 
morale is much much stronger so that
means<00:03:25.330> that<00:03:25.450> I<00:03:25.570> have<00:03:25.630> these<00:03:25.900> Romans<00:03:26.320> very

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
means that I have these Romans very

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.430 
means that I have these Romans very
badly<00:03:26.890> fixed<00:03:27.430> so<00:03:28.180> the<00:03:28.390> devastating<00:03:28.960> charge<00:03:29.200> my

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
badly fixed so the devastating charge my

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.980 
badly fixed so the devastating charge my
heavy<00:03:29.650> cavalry<00:03:29.920> just<00:03:30.280> broke<00:03:30.610> them<00:03:30.850> and<00:03:31.060> over

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
heavy cavalry just broke them and over

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.420 
heavy cavalry just broke them and over
here<00:03:32.140> my<00:03:32.260> light<00:03:32.440> cavalry<00:03:32.680> met<00:03:33.100> with<00:03:33.220> success

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
here my light cavalry met with success

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.170 
here my light cavalry met with success
also<00:03:34.230> and<00:03:35.230> now<00:03:35.410> it<00:03:35.560> becomes<00:03:35.770> a<00:03:36.040> just<00:03:36.910> a<00:03:36.970> matter

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
also and now it becomes a just a matter

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.470 
also and now it becomes a just a matter
of<00:03:37.300> running<00:03:37.900> down<00:03:37.930> the<00:03:38.440> fleeing<00:03:39.100> Roman<00:03:39.580> so

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
of running down the fleeing Roman so

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.500 
of running down the fleeing Roman so
here's<00:03:40.660> some<00:03:40.870> battlefield<00:03:41.530> carnage<00:03:42.280> from<00:03:43.150> an

the units of Roman equities has come

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:53.820 
the units of Roman equities has come
back<00:03:52.330> from<00:03:52.390> routing<00:03:52.900> but<00:03:53.170> they're<00:03:53.380> going<00:03:53.620> to

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
back from routing but they're going to

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.210 
back from routing but they're going to

rear out so this game allows you to have

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.740 
rear out so this game allows you to have
a<00:03:57.280> little<00:03:57.460> bit<00:03:57.670> more<00:03:57.790> accurate<00:03:58.180> simulation<00:03:58.690> of

a little bit more accurate simulation of
