00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:37.940 
up in the sky up in this guy has to be

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.330 
up in the sky up in this guy has to be
bigger<00:07:38.660> because<00:07:38.900> I<00:07:39.320> mean<00:07:39.650> smaller<00:07:40.010> because

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:40.340 
bigger because I mean smaller because

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.550 
bigger because I mean smaller because
these<00:07:40.760> planes<00:07:41.300> look<00:07:41.510> like<00:07:41.690> that<00:07:41.900> big<00:07:42.170> I<00:07:42.350> mean

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:42.560 
these planes look like that big I mean

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.990 
these planes look like that big I mean
that<00:07:42.680> small<00:07:42.830> no<00:07:43.160> but<00:07:43.340> stuff<00:07:43.670> doesn't<00:07:43.880> just

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.000

that small no but stuff doesn't just
drop<00:07:44.420> off<00:07:44.660> a<00:07:44.690> planes<00:07:45.200> like<00:07:45.530> that<00:07:48.970> why<00:07:49.970> is<00:07:50.030> it

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:50.240 
drop off a planes like that why is it

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:56.380 
drop off a planes like that why is it
over<00:07:50.330> there<00:07:50.450> it<00:07:50.870> was<00:07:51.020> over<00:07:51.380> there<00:07:55.390> that

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:56.390 
over there it was over there that

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:59.850 
over there it was over there that
started<00:07:56.780> over<00:07:56.870> here<00:07:57.020> went<00:07:57.860> there<00:07:58.190> went<00:07:59.060> there
