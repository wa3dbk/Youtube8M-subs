00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.580
 It may look like that to many 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.010
 but biomaterial already has waste 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.870
 nothing to do for a long time 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.620
 as a garden or organic waste 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.230
 keep house 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.059
 It is the cycle of nature 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.360
 Compost becomes a sought-after raw material 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.360
 makes 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:27.110
 Trans bird is considered a compost pioneer 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.300
 He has one of the first bathing in Baden 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.370
 commercial composting plants in 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.780
 built in Germany 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.690
 today he is a consultant and 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.760
 service provider in things compost around 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:43.300
 asked the globe when I was 25 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:48.320
 Active and their waste today 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:50.390
 raw material is a raw material made from residues over 10 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.650
 million tonnes of bio-waste fall in the 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.589
 year in Germany 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.930
 next to paper and cardboard the most important 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:59.510
 valuable fraction of household waste 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.480
 and long recognized by the communes as 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.610
 valuable raw material carefully processed 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.730
 arises in only a few 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.430
 procedural steps in 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:10.400
 Composting a versatile 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.560
 usable natural product of compost 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.820
 Corpus is an important raw material 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.770
 we waste from the biological 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.200
 win and he gives us humus for 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.940
 the floors themselves the gardeners the winemakers 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.409
 and also the farmers have recognized 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.750
 that humus is an important nutrient 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:26.320
 represents the factor and that the lack 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.950
 there is almost 1000 available 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.500
 composting plants are already in 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.630
 Germany emerged 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.600
 400 of them work certified with ral 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.450
 quality assurance is the basis for a 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.420
 Qualified end product and therefore for 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.100
 a profitable marketing 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.100
 Important here are high technical 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.200
 standards a hygienic processing 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.750
 and controls consistent 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.910
 conditions in nature lasts 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.040
 removal of organic material via a 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.350
 year under controlled conditions 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.540
 but lets the rotting go 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.770
 optimize and accelerate 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:06.170
 with the unique gorr cover system 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.910
 a real climate chamber of 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.039
 outside is the so-called rent through 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.980
 a special membrane cover against 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.200
 weather conditions protected 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:18.349
 inside arises computer-controlled and 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.260
 optimally ventilates the air the 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:23.780
 microorganisms need to get waste in 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.200
 fastest possible time in high quality 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.540
 to convert compost 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.860
 the computer-controlled monitoring 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.530
 assures the compliance of the 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.980
 quality standards and gives the proof 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.690
 for a quality product 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.790
 the industry looks to a safe 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.980
 future and has long been 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.599
 Processing of bio-waste is no longer possible 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.500
 only a matter of public 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.480
 hand 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.250
 no composting does not work 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.959
 only the municipal waste disposal more and more 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.920
 Private investors have discovered that 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.450
 this is an investment in the future 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.360
 dwindling raw materials and rising 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.530
 polluting the environment 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.860
 waste management to a big one 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.590
 social theme of the future 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:08.239
 nationally and internationally and that means 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.239
 it's all something for us
