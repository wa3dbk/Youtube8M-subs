look a little bit foolish and I use the

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
word foolish because this is what we

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.349 
word foolish because this is what we
think<00:00:19.980> in<00:00:20.070> our<00:00:20.160> heads<00:00:20.430> this<00:00:20.789> is<00:00:20.880> what<00:00:21.000> we<00:00:21.090> feel

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.050 
think in our heads this is what we feel
like<00:00:21.570> so<00:00:22.289> therefore<00:00:22.769> that's<00:00:23.400> what<00:00:23.580> we<00:00:23.730> assume

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
like so therefore that's what we assume

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.429 
like so therefore that's what we assume
that<00:00:24.090> we<00:00:24.330> must<00:00:24.449> look<00:00:24.600> like<00:00:24.689> other<00:00:24.930> people<00:00:25.289> and

maybe we do sometime I'm talking about
this<00:00:27.119> particularly<00:00:27.660> because<00:00:27.840> i'm<00:00:28.260> learning

them into this new limited vocabulary
and<00:01:51.420> knowledge<00:01:51.899> that's<00:01:52.350> top<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:53.040> think<00:01:53.399> why

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
and knowledge that's top I think why

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.980 
and knowledge that's top I think why
this<00:01:53.520> might<00:01:53.850> be<00:01:53.970> so<00:01:54.119> challenging<00:01:54.329> for<00:01:54.659> us<00:01:54.810> as

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
this might be so challenging for us as

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.740 
this might be so challenging for us as
adults<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.500> because<00:01:55.829> we<00:01:56.520> grow<00:01:56.939> up<00:01:57.119> as<00:01:57.299> kids<00:01:57.509> and

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
adults is because we grow up as kids and

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.719 
adults is because we grow up as kids and
