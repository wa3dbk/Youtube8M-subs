00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.909
 this program made possible by 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.909
 pcs 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.750
 product quality bottle 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.220
 welcome to the final of the terms of 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.260
 Ideas slat trap sponsored by cattle 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.760
 travel because years are definitely not allowed 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.429
 forget because that is ultimately the 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.160
 price that is on it and you can get it 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.500
 they may have a trip of their choice in europe 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.450
 and then concern a match day and 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.180
 that may be germany 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.870
 turkey spain italy to go we it 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.730
 so ask them what they want what they want 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.460
 right to me for the viewers left 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.379
 probably all but I sat 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.789
 know zanten and very well than all 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.789
 match wanted 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.160
 no not yet no actually not no 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.390
 looks convincing 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.670
 of course not necessary 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.289
 and it was easy but I will 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.530
 to attempt 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:08.070
 helio the week adidas 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.840
 the intention and thereafter lara cola yes that 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.460
 although there is already my back 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.860
 no not yet you go it wants 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.170
 but i think i do for barcelona 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.520
 voter and there and there that too 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.400
 your luck that way because here that 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.009
 said that we are going to use concert 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.229
 do from the sixteen 5 times 2 times 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.030
 from the center line and since 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.280
 everyone had the orphan point in the 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.450
 preliminary round in the semi-final 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.909
 marcellus start but they have it 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.530
 decided which of you will start 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.000
 Dario is going to start people very much 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.400
 good luck watching this final 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.320
 Heads are tight, even he 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:45.320
 prefer no interview i want me 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:47.970
 naturally we honor that concentration 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.840
 he will try it out here 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.390
 in the preparation must see 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.070
 mainly having helio but good 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.750
 He is keen to show what he is 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.549
 can 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.770
 it is determined in mutual consultation that 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.450
 we shoot a bit with the wind 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.090
 may also be a bit easier later 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.600
 from the center line 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.409
 the center circle you see it says 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.409
 some wind kilos 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.890
 here are just below 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.310
 right to go a little further away than normal 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.370
 anything to do with that wind maybe 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.780
 talking about concentration 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.780
 shell north flew to zero 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.780
 helio the rich slides shot in the first 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.450
 two rounds of the semifinals four 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.110
 out of five and now to do that is 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.110
 remarkable again 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.580
 the first names are charlois 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.170
 I stay with Charles after the first 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:56.530
 round on a mixed-up 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.910
 on behalf of and going to try it from 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.130
 the sixteen to do that is not his 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.260
 strongest side he needs it mainly 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.829
 having the center circle there shot 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:10.930
 which are also all relative to vab 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:12.280
 hey that's first even he shot away 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.430
 the center line on the bar and that is number 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.430
 2 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.930
 That means they are mine anyway 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.819
 lead later towards the 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.900
 center circle only go with how many 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.900
 difference her they do that 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.160
 I go their envoys to myself 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.350
 try to extend the lead because 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.130
 from the center line tomorrow busy here 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.139
 sets the three times 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.459
 this one just flies over it so yes they do 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:43.269
 want a buffertje everyone 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:46.150
 case just choose which is slow that 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.500
 is 3 and then this can be just four words 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.079
 and then they have 3 points for van 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.389
 it is not becoming psychological 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.709
 the between sand is 3 to 1 in for the time being 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:55.239
 the trail of elbow and breathe in the 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:59.380
 shift can be over well we are 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:00.880
 both have missed radio 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.269
 try to bring them here from 4 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.420
 after you would think there is no point 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:06.420
 has 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.880
 if you think well how are they in 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.620
 the finals are you back images 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.480
 see 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.830
 he just has a kick he only yes 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.900
 from the center line let me now briefly 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.359
 hey not see how long because it has to 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.280
 all still play or shoot then must 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.639
 one of these cities on do this he does 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.639
 it just doesn't 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:29.490
 and now the question is whether he is all through 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:32.610
 had it is just not and with that we have 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.750
 winners Elbow continues 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.930
 and we them go a while we 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.930
 get it 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.910
 when I understand the eagerness with you 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.030
 all green yes do n't want to go 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:47.220
 expected but in the end dishes that 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.840
