00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.690
 Hello everyone, Anton and today I 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:13.070
 teach you how to make us dropped - fashion 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:16.500
 on industrial craft 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:19.650
 I confess honestly whether it is necessary of course complete 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:24.539
 shit compared to the cabin here they are 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:27.449
 now who else is also on the best 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.359
 bib better on bib this 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.780
 steepness even compared to kvan but 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:47.250
 there is a quantum better bib he is 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:01:01.949
 the best kind of bib who 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:01:06.380
 now this is when he can fly now 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:11.390
 I will show you what a quantum can do 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:16.130
 quantum helmet and allows our Persians 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:19.740
 the character breathe underwater endlessly 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:23.490
 mom what pants they let run 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:32.420
 Here is such a speed on the boots are not 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:36.680
 allow you to jump ahrinno and finally 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:40.470
 Of course, I instead wear under 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:47.579
 letting him take all the damage 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:51.570
 when also i charge when flying to 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:56.670
 nakrutok allowed well short in this 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:59.250
 video speech we will go to body armor for 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.780
 in order to brighten her we need 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:07.220
 Wow, how do uhrenischa carbon fiber 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:12.369
 and 4 multi crystals 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.369
 such reds here carbon fiber and coal 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:21.470
 Now I will show you how to do 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:25.400
 carbon fiber is most likely in 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:29.830
 I donâ€™t have enough coal for them 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:34.489
 I'll go after him at this time set 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:37.040
 buy here the coal you put in the gift 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:44.390
 abode he said when both of these do 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:46.370
 of course, and of course you 'll have to have 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.959
 patience because it is hell how long 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:54.910
 everything is done we will wait 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:58.209
 four coal fools to make 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:01.610
 carbon fiber we need 2 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.910
 carbon fiber carbon powder you 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:10.250
 we put it like this 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:14.989
 we get carbon fibers for crafting 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:20.890
 can be two carbon fiber and so i have 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:20.890
 There are 4 carbon fibers to make 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:28.549
 such as can be here and so serve 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:35.680
 carbon fiber and just carbon 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:38.380
 cloth here 2 carbon stand how to do 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:45.500
 I showed you the compressor in this video 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:48.400
 here's the compressor you put carbon cloth 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:53.829
 and it recycles any plastic 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.829
 nothing complicated here to be honest
