00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
you know that was all of a sudden

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.000 
you know that was all of a sudden
something<00:03:01.840> she<00:03:02.050> didn't<00:03:02.320> want<00:03:02.380> to<00:03:02.560> be<00:03:02.680> a<00:03:02.709> part

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
something she didn't want to be a part

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.400 
something she didn't want to be a part
of<00:03:03.130> which<00:03:03.430> is<00:03:03.640> kind<00:03:04.090> of<00:03:04.180> funny<00:03:04.420> but<00:03:05.050> the<00:03:05.200> judge

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
of which is kind of funny but the judge

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.350 
of which is kind of funny but the judge
made<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:05.800> right<00:03:05.950> call<00:03:06.250> there<00:03:06.550> and<00:03:06.880> so<00:03:07.180> now

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
made the right call there and so now

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.449 
made the right call there and so now
she's<00:03:07.660> going<00:03:07.870> to<00:03:08.020> strongly<00:03:08.500> argue<00:03:09.040> that<00:03:09.220> it

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
she's going to strongly argue that it

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.790 
she's going to strongly argue that it
should<00:03:09.700> not<00:03:09.880> be<00:03:09.940> seen<00:03:10.630> anywhere<00:03:11.170> that<00:03:11.620> that

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
should not be seen anywhere that that

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.100 
should not be seen anywhere that that
shouldn't<00:03:12.160> be<00:03:12.340> leaked<00:03:13.239> to<00:03:13.390> a<00:03:13.450> third<00:03:13.660> party<00:03:14.020> of

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
shouldn't be leaked to a third party of

shouldn't be leaked to a third party of
any<00:03:14.230> sort<00:03:14.530> right<00:03:15.120> well<00:03:16.120> yes<00:03:16.390> but<00:03:16.570> that<00:03:16.630> I<00:03:16.780> can

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
any sort right well yes but that I can

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.290 
any sort right well yes but that I can
slightly<00:03:17.350> understand<00:03:18.010> because<00:03:18.340> depositions

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
slightly understand because depositions

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.330 
slightly understand because depositions
are<00:03:19.720> you<00:03:20.110> know<00:03:20.230> you<00:03:20.320> don't<00:03:20.440> want<00:03:20.650> to<00:03:20.770> taint<00:03:21.100> a

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
are you know you don't want to taint a

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.160 
are you know you don't want to taint a
potential<00:03:21.910> memory<00:03:22.270> pool<00:03:22.510> so<00:03:22.780> they<00:03:22.900> want<00:03:23.080> to

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
potential memory pool so they want to

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.900 
potential memory pool so they want to
preserve<00:03:23.530> these<00:03:23.709> depositions<00:03:24.130> for<00:03:24.640> time<00:03:24.880> of

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
preserve these depositions for time of

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.000 
preserve these depositions for time of
trial<00:03:25.360> but<00:03:25.870> at<00:03:25.989> some<00:03:26.230> point<00:03:26.260> in<00:03:26.590> time<00:03:26.620> I<00:03:26.830> think

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
trial but at some point in time I think

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.830 
trial but at some point in time I think
those<00:03:27.370> depositions<00:03:27.730> might<00:03:28.269> get<00:03:28.480> released

those depositions might get released
