00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.570 
magazine we'll be starting off looking
at<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.539> 60<00:00:21.990> watt<00:00:22.199> incandescent<00:00:22.440> light<00:00:23.250> it

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
at the 60 watt incandescent light it

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.400 
at the 60 watt incandescent light it
puts<00:00:23.880> out<00:00:24.090> about<00:00:24.359> eight<00:00:24.720> hundred<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.080> fifty

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
puts out about eight hundred and fifty

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.720 
puts out about eight hundred and fifty
lumens<00:00:25.800> so<00:00:25.859> that's<00:00:26.100> a<00:00:26.250> little<00:00:26.400> bit<00:00:26.550> better

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
lumens so that's a little bit better

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.900 
lumens so that's a little bit better
than<00:00:27.170> fourteen<00:00:28.170> lumens<00:00:28.529> per<00:00:28.590> watt<00:00:28.789> next<00:00:29.789> we'll

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
than fourteen lumens per watt next we'll

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.720 
than fourteen lumens per watt next we'll
go<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.060> this<00:00:30.420> dimmable<00:00:30.800> CFLs<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:32.009> puts<00:00:32.219> out<00:00:32.399> it

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
go to this dimmable CFLs it puts out it

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.150 
go to this dimmable CFLs it puts out it
requires<00:00:33.480> about<00:00:33.660> 15<00:00:34.320> watts<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.800> puts<00:00:35.010> out

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
requires about 15 watts and puts out

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.310 
requires about 15 watts and puts out
about<00:00:35.309> 1,100<00:00:36.210> lumens<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:36.570> it's<00:00:36.989> not<00:00:37.079> quite<00:00:37.230> a

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
about 1,100 lumens so it's not quite a

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.200 
about 1,100 lumens so it's not quite a
bit<00:00:37.500> more<00:00:37.710> light<00:00:38.190> actually<00:00:38.489> than<00:00:38.940> the

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
bit more light actually than the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.830 
bit more light actually than the
incandescent<00:00:40.130> next<00:00:41.130> we'll<00:00:41.309> go<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.460> this<00:00:41.969> it's

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
incandescent next we'll go to this it's

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.500 
incandescent next we'll go to this it's
called<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.140> snowcone<00:00:43.739> LED<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.880> LEDs<00:00:45.329> are

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
called a snowcone LED the LEDs are

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.869 
called a snowcone LED the LEDs are
mounted<00:00:46.110> horizontally<00:00:46.530> here<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.489> they<00:00:47.610> put

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
mounted horizontally here and they put

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.119 
mounted horizontally here and they put
out<00:00:48.000> light<00:00:48.780> they<00:00:49.079> emit<00:00:49.320> them<00:00:49.500> as<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.649> point

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
out light they emit them as a point

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.770 
out light they emit them as a point
sources<00:00:50.430> of<00:00:50.640> light<00:00:50.879> which<00:00:51.059> means<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.480> end<00:00:51.629> up

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
sources of light which means you end up

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.650 
sources of light which means you end up
with<00:00:51.930> sort<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.350> half<00:00:52.559> bowl<00:00:53.250> shaped<00:00:53.760> light

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
with sort of a half bowl shaped light

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.459 
with sort of a half bowl shaped light
source<00:00:55.079> after<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.129> we'll<00:00:56.399> go<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.670> this

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
source after that we'll go to this

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.729 
source after that we'll go to this
really<00:00:58.469> brand<00:00:58.829> new<00:00:59.129> LED<00:00:59.789> light<00:01:00.079> just<00:01:01.079> put<00:01:01.649> out

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
really brand new LED light just put out

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.979 
really brand new LED light just put out
by<00:01:01.980> philips<00:01:02.520> this<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.270> about<00:01:03.449> twelve<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:03.899> a

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
by philips this is about twelve and a

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.499 
by philips this is about twelve and a
half<00:01:04.140> watts<00:01:04.409> puts<00:01:04.739> out<00:01:04.890> about<00:01:05.100> 800<00:01:05.880> lumens<00:01:06.090> so

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
half watts puts out about 800 lumens so

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:09.919 
half watts puts out about 800 lumens so
it's<00:01:07.020> almost<00:01:07.409> as<00:01:07.679> great<00:01:08.509> put<00:01:09.509> down<00:01:09.630> as<00:01:09.749> much

00:01:09.919 --> 00:01:09.929 
it's almost as great put down as much

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:12.800 
it's almost as great put down as much
light<00:01:10.829> as<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.340> incandescent<00:01:11.729> for<00:01:12.659> it's

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
light as the incandescent for it's

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.379 
light as the incandescent for it's
twelve<00:01:13.109> and<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.259> half<00:01:13.319> watts<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.389> you'll

00:01:15.379 --> 00:01:15.389 
twelve and a half watts and you'll

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:17.419 
twelve and a half watts and you'll
notice<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:15.810> has<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:16.139> interesting<00:01:16.529> yellow

00:01:17.419 --> 00:01:17.429 
notice it has this interesting yellow

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:20.899 
notice it has this interesting yellow
rather<00:01:17.849> than<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.119> white<00:01:18.450> or<00:01:18.689> clear<00:01:19.429> bulb<00:01:20.429> to<00:01:20.759> it

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
rather than a white or clear bulb to it

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.879 
rather than a white or clear bulb to it
this<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.119> what's<00:01:21.420> called<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.840> remote<00:01:22.020> phosphor

00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:22.889 
this is what's called a remote phosphor

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:26.559 
this is what's called a remote phosphor
so<00:01:23.219> the<00:01:23.849> blue<00:01:24.179> LEDs<00:01:24.810> are<00:01:25.319> mounted<00:01:25.740> vertically

00:01:26.559 --> 00:01:26.569 
so the blue LEDs are mounted vertically

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:29.269 
so the blue LEDs are mounted vertically
hidden<00:01:27.569> in<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.719> centre<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.049> this<00:01:28.229> column<00:01:28.679> that

00:01:29.269 --> 00:01:29.279 
hidden in the centre of this column that

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:31.399 
hidden in the centre of this column that
a<00:01:29.520> blue<00:01:29.700> LED<00:01:29.880> goes<00:01:30.270> out<00:01:30.539> strikes<00:01:30.959> the<00:01:31.139> remote

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
a blue LED goes out strikes the remote

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.830 
a blue LED goes out strikes the remote
foster<00:01:31.950> which<00:01:32.130> then<00:01:32.399> emits<00:01:32.909> in<00:01:33.090> turn<00:01:33.359> a<00:01:33.389> white

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
foster which then emits in turn a white

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.589 
foster which then emits in turn a white
light<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.439> it's<00:01:34.590> able<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.889> do<00:01:35.099> that<00:01:35.369> in<00:01:35.639> a<00:01:35.789> in<00:01:36.359> a

00:01:36.589 --> 00:01:36.599 
light and it's able to do that in a in a

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:39.349 
light and it's able to do that in a in a
spherical<00:01:37.229> source<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:38.099> it's<00:01:38.219> really<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.549> fairly

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:39.359 
spherical source so it's really a fairly

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:42.949 
spherical source so it's really a fairly
complex<00:01:40.020> design<00:01:40.709> and<00:01:41.099> very<00:01:41.880> interesting<00:01:42.299> to

00:01:42.949 --> 00:01:42.959 
complex design and very interesting to

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:44.599 
complex design and very interesting to
take<00:01:43.109> a<00:01:43.139> look<00:01:43.380> at<00:01:43.469> how<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.649> one<00:01:44.009> works<00:01:44.189> so

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:44.609 
take a look at how that one works so

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:47.089 
take a look at how that one works so
let's<00:01:45.359> go<00:01:45.689> set<00:01:46.049> up<00:01:46.169> the<00:01:46.319> lights<00:01:46.529> start<00:01:46.919> with

00:01:47.089 --> 00:01:47.099 
let's go set up the lights start with

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:49.190 
let's go set up the lights start with
the<00:01:47.249> traditional<00:01:47.880> incandescent<00:01:48.509> light<00:01:48.989> bulb

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
the traditional incandescent light bulb

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.620 
the traditional incandescent light bulb
this<00:01:49.319> is<00:01:49.499> a<00:01:49.529> 60<00:01:49.979> watt<00:01:50.189> light<00:01:50.369> bulb<00:01:50.849> puts<00:01:51.479> down

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
this is a 60 watt light bulb puts down

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.760 
this is a 60 watt light bulb puts down
about<00:01:51.840> 850<00:01:52.829> lumens<00:01:53.189> of<00:01:53.369> light<00:01:53.849> or<00:01:54.509> about<00:01:55.229> 14

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
about 850 lumens of light or about 14

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:56.599 
about 850 lumens of light or about 14
lumens<00:01:56.130> per<00:01:56.189> watt

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:56.609 
lumens per watt

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:59.059 
lumens per watt
note<00:01:57.419> that<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.929> light<00:01:58.139> comes<00:01:58.439> down<00:01:58.709> in<00:01:58.950> a

00:01:59.059 --> 00:01:59.069 
note that the light comes down in a

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:02.269 
note that the light comes down in a
spherical<00:01:59.939> almost<00:02:00.359> 360<00:02:01.200> degree<00:02:01.709> pattern<00:02:02.130> and

00:02:02.269 --> 00:02:02.279 
spherical almost 360 degree pattern and

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:04.190 
spherical almost 360 degree pattern and
there's<00:02:02.399> just<00:02:02.609> this<00:02:02.759> little<00:02:03.059> shadow<00:02:03.869> down

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
there's just this little shadow down

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.289 
there's just this little shadow down
there<00:02:04.469> at<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.709> bottom<00:02:05.099> let's<00:02:05.729> also<00:02:05.909> take<00:02:06.239> a

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
there at the bottom let's also take a

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.660 
there at the bottom let's also take a
look<00:02:06.630> at<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:07.319> heat<00:02:07.559> being<00:02:07.799> generated<00:02:07.889> by<00:02:08.610> this

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
look at the heat being generated by this

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.460 
look at the heat being generated by this
by<00:02:09.479> this<00:02:09.539> bulb<00:02:10.849> we<00:02:11.849> can<00:02:12.030> see<00:02:12.209> it's<00:02:12.360> about<00:02:13.159> 366

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
by this bulb we can see it's about 366

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.210 
by this bulb we can see it's about 366
degrees<00:02:15.210> which<00:02:16.210> is<00:02:16.240> a<00:02:16.630> lot<00:02:17.020> of<00:02:17.410> heat<00:02:18.040> that's

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
degrees which is a lot of heat that's

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.100 
degrees which is a lot of heat that's
energy<00:02:18.550> that's<00:02:18.970> being<00:02:19.210> wasted<00:02:19.540> it's<00:02:19.960> not

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
energy that's being wasted it's not

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.650 
energy that's being wasted it's not
being<00:02:20.260> converted<00:02:20.590> into<00:02:20.890> light<00:02:21.190> it's<00:02:21.820> going<00:02:22.180> up

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
being converted into light it's going up

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.500 
being converted into light it's going up
into<00:02:22.870> heat<00:02:23.230> so<00:02:23.650> now<00:02:23.860> let's<00:02:24.210> see<00:02:25.210> how<00:02:25.360> it<00:02:25.390> does

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
into heat so now let's see how it does

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:34.170 
into heat so now let's see how it does
with<00:02:25.840> dimming<00:02:26.230> and<00:02:27.270> dims<00:02:29.310> we're<00:02:32.970> just<00:02:33.970> seeing

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
with dimming and dims we're just seeing

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.170 
with dimming and dims we're just seeing
the<00:02:34.450> light<00:02:34.690> there<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:35.550> goes<00:02:36.550> all<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:36.820> way<00:02:36.940> up

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
the light there and goes all the way up

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.480 
the light there and goes all the way up
to<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.480> top<00:02:37.720> as<00:02:38.410> far<00:02:38.710> as<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:39.010> throat<00:02:39.310> that

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
to the top as far as the throat that

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.400 
to the top as far as the throat that
triac<00:02:39.910> that's<00:02:40.150> about<00:02:40.390> dimming<00:02:40.930> it<00:02:41.020> seems<00:02:41.230> like

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
triac that's about dimming it seems like

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.650 
triac that's about dimming it seems like
it's<00:02:41.590> doing<00:02:41.920> about<00:02:42.490> twenty<00:02:42.970> five<00:02:43.120> percenters

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
it's doing about twenty five percenters

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.170 
it's doing about twenty five percenters
okay<00:02:43.990> let's<00:02:44.200> take<00:02:44.380> a<00:02:44.440> look<00:02:44.680> at<00:02:44.860> a<00:02:44.920> dimmable<00:02:45.400> CFL

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
okay let's take a look at a dimmable CFL

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.220 
okay let's take a look at a dimmable CFL
now<00:02:46.960> this<00:02:47.380> is<00:02:47.560> a<00:02:47.860> 15<00:02:48.340> watt<00:02:48.490> CFL<00:02:48.810> puts<00:02:49.810> out<00:02:49.990> about

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
now this is a 15 watt CFL puts out about

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.330 
now this is a 15 watt CFL puts out about
1100<00:02:51.100> lumens<00:02:51.580> of<00:02:51.700> light<00:02:52.150> so<00:02:52.840> it<00:02:52.990> puts<00:02:53.200> out<00:02:53.350> more

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
1100 lumens of light so it puts out more

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.570 
1100 lumens of light so it puts out more
luminous<00:02:54.760> than<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:55.090> incandescent<00:02:55.650> at<00:02:56.650> 15

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
luminous than the incandescent at 15

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.330 
luminous than the incandescent at 15
watts<00:02:57.790> versus<00:02:58.480> 60<00:02:58.930> watts<00:02:59.170> let's<00:02:59.800> see<00:03:00.010> what<00:03:00.190> the

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
watts versus 60 watts let's see what the

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.710 
watts versus 60 watts let's see what the
temperature<00:03:00.820> of<00:03:00.880> it<00:03:01.060> is<00:03:05.130> it's<00:03:06.130> reading<00:03:06.430> about

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
temperature of it is it's reading about

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.140 
temperature of it is it's reading about
184<00:03:08.070> degrees<00:03:09.070> Fahrenheit<00:03:09.640> so<00:03:09.670> it's<00:03:09.970> pretty

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
184 degrees Fahrenheit so it's pretty

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.420 
184 degrees Fahrenheit so it's pretty
hot<00:03:10.420> and<00:03:10.750> now<00:03:11.440> let's<00:03:11.620> take<00:03:11.800> a<00:03:11.860> look<00:03:12.100> at<00:03:12.250> how

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
hot and now let's take a look at how

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.730 
hot and now let's take a look at how
well<00:03:12.670> it<00:03:12.850> dims<00:03:15.600> not<00:03:16.600> much<00:03:16.780> is<00:03:16.960> happening<00:03:17.140> I'm

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
well it dims not much is happening I'm

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.040 
well it dims not much is happening I'm
dimming<00:03:18.160> I'm<00:03:18.459> dimming<00:03:18.940> i'm<00:03:19.180> dimming<00:03:19.600> i'm

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
dimming I'm dimming i'm dimming i'm

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.800 
dimming I'm dimming i'm dimming i'm
dimming

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.800 

and<00:03:23.700> that's<00:03:24.700> kind<00:03:24.969> of<00:03:25.000> tacky<00:03:27.569> dimming<00:03:28.569> all<00:03:28.689> the

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
and that's kind of tacky dimming all the

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:36.539 
and that's kind of tacky dimming all the
way<00:03:28.930> down<00:03:29.200> coming<00:03:29.709> up<00:03:29.799> slowly<00:03:30.069> now<00:03:33.420> and<00:03:35.549> that's

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
way down coming up slowly now and that's

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.970 
way down coming up slowly now and that's
it<00:03:37.150> so<00:03:37.450> I<00:03:37.480> don't<00:03:37.689> know<00:03:37.930> if<00:03:38.109> I'd<00:03:38.230> call<00:03:38.260> it<00:03:38.500> really

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
it so I don't know if I'd call it really

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.649 
it so I don't know if I'd call it really
a<00:03:39.010> dimming<00:03:39.579> and<00:03:39.609> certainly<00:03:39.969> notice<00:03:40.269> smoothing

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:40.659 
a dimming and certainly notice smoothing

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:42.629 
a dimming and certainly notice smoothing
out<00:03:40.750> a<00:03:40.780> lot<00:03:40.989> of<00:03:41.079> dimming<00:03:41.379> our<00:03:41.829> next<00:03:42.099> bulb<00:03:42.340> type

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:42.639 
out a lot of dimming our next bulb type

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.750 
out a lot of dimming our next bulb type
is<00:03:42.849> an<00:03:43.090> LED<00:03:43.480> snow<00:03:44.109> cone<00:03:44.409> as<00:03:44.859> you<00:03:45.099> can<00:03:45.280> see<00:03:45.519> quite

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
is an LED snow cone as you can see quite

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.550 
is an LED snow cone as you can see quite
a<00:03:45.879> bit<00:03:45.939> different<00:03:46.359> bulb<00:03:46.569> shape<00:03:46.870> from<00:03:47.049> both<00:03:47.290> the

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
a bit different bulb shape from both the

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.179 
a bit different bulb shape from both the
incandescent<00:03:47.859> and<00:03:48.370> the<00:03:48.989> the<00:03:49.989> CFL<00:03:50.500> it<00:03:50.769> is<00:03:50.950> in

00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:51.189 
incandescent and the the CFL it is in

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:53.129 
incandescent and the the CFL it is in
their<00:03:51.400> shape<00:03:51.670> of<00:03:51.849> a<00:03:52.000> snow<00:03:52.299> cone<00:03:52.540> but<00:03:52.930> also

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:53.139 
their shape of a snow cone but also

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:54.839 
their shape of a snow cone but also
notice<00:03:53.439> the<00:03:53.680> light<00:03:53.889> pattern<00:03:54.189> rather<00:03:54.519> than<00:03:54.819> a

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 
notice the light pattern rather than a

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:57.569 
notice the light pattern rather than a
spherical<00:03:55.650> pattern<00:03:56.650> they're<00:03:56.799> only<00:03:57.040> showed<00:03:57.340> a

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
spherical pattern they're only showed a

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:59.849 
spherical pattern they're only showed a
shadow<00:03:57.939> down<00:03:58.269> at<00:03:58.419> the<00:03:58.540> bottom<00:03:58.720> the<00:03:59.500> light

00:03:59.849 --> 00:03:59.859 
shadow down at the bottom the light

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:01.920 
shadow down at the bottom the light
really<00:04:00.159> comes<00:04:00.370> up<00:04:00.549> only<00:04:00.790> a<00:04:01.090> hemispherical<00:04:01.840> a

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
really comes up only a hemispherical a

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.229 
really comes up only a hemispherical a
like<00:04:02.109> a<00:04:02.139> half<00:04:02.859> of<00:04:03.069> a<00:04:03.189> ball<00:04:03.370> shaped<00:04:03.790> over<00:04:04.150> the

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
like a half of a ball shaped over the

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:05.670 
like a half of a ball shaped over the
light<00:04:04.419> so<00:04:04.599> that's<00:04:04.780> that's<00:04:05.049> a<00:04:05.200> fairly<00:04:05.530> large

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
light so that's that's a fairly large

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.770 
light so that's that's a fairly large
difference<00:04:06.189> for<00:04:06.430> it<00:04:06.549> let's<00:04:07.090> take<00:04:07.239> a<00:04:07.299> look<00:04:07.569> at

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
difference for it let's take a look at

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.550 
difference for it let's take a look at
the<00:04:08.139> temperature<00:04:09.750> looking<00:04:10.750> again<00:04:11.079> at<00:04:11.139> the<00:04:11.319> top

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
the temperature looking again at the top

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.959 
the temperature looking again at the top
as<00:04:11.889> we<00:04:12.040> did<00:04:12.189> with<00:04:12.280> the<00:04:12.340> other<00:04:12.519> two<00:04:12.760> lights

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:12.969 
as we did with the other two lights

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:13.530 
as we did with the other two lights
we'll<00:04:13.180> see

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
we'll see

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.959 
we'll see
92<00:04:14.019> degrees<00:04:14.049> significantly<00:04:15.040> lower<00:04:15.340> but<00:04:15.849> now

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:15.969 
92 degrees significantly lower but now

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:16.890 
92 degrees significantly lower but now
let's<00:04:16.150> take<00:04:16.269> a<00:04:16.329> look<00:04:16.599> at<00:04:16.690> where<00:04:16.810> the

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
let's take a look at where the

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.539 
let's take a look at where the
electronics<00:04:17.500> are<00:04:17.650> down<00:04:17.859> here<00:04:18.190> where<00:04:18.430> the

electronics are down here where the
heatsink<00:04:18.970> is<00:04:19.150> and<00:04:19.479> we<00:04:20.349> see<00:04:20.590> that's

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
heatsink is and we see that's

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.320 
heatsink is and we see that's
registering<00:04:21.459> about<00:04:21.669> a<00:04:21.699> hundred<00:04:22.120> and<00:04:22.150> thirty

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
registering about a hundred and thirty

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.710 
registering about a hundred and thirty
degrees<00:04:22.889> so<00:04:23.889> a<00:04:24.460> big<00:04:24.820> difference<00:04:25.210> there<00:04:25.449> rather

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
degrees so a big difference there rather

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.659

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.260 

most<00:05:24.800> I've<00:05:24.980> been<00:05:25.100> able<00:05:25.220> to<00:05:25.400> get<00:05:25.550> this<00:05:25.700> register

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
most I've been able to get this register

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.930 
most I've been able to get this register
is<00:05:26.300> about<00:05:26.690> a<00:05:26.720> hundred<00:05:27.350> and<00:05:27.410> ten<00:05:27.680> degrees

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
is about a hundred and ten degrees

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.920 
is about a hundred and ten degrees
mostly<00:05:28.940> it<00:05:29.510> wavers<00:05:30.500> between<00:05:30.910> 80<00:05:31.910> and<00:05:32.300> 90

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
mostly it wavers between 80 and 90

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.820 
mostly it wavers between 80 and 90
degrees<00:05:33.320> and<00:05:34.250> the<00:05:34.400> heatsink<00:05:34.910> is<00:05:35.320> a<00:05:36.320> little

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
degrees and the heatsink is a little

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.310 
degrees and the heatsink is a little
cooler<00:05:37.130> it's<00:05:37.280> closer<00:05:37.550> to<00:05:37.700> 90<00:05:38.180> degrees<00:05:38.810> rise<00:05:39.080> up

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
cooler it's closer to 90 degrees rise up

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.260 
cooler it's closer to 90 degrees rise up
at<00:05:39.440> the<00:05:39.500> top<00:05:39.710> you<00:05:39.860> can<00:05:40.010> get<00:05:40.160> over<00:05:40.910> a<00:05:40.940> hundred

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
at the top you can get over a hundred

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.570 
at the top you can get over a hundred
degrees<00:05:41.560> now<00:05:42.560> let's<00:05:42.800> take<00:05:43.040> a<00:05:43.070> look<00:05:43.310> at<00:05:43.490> the

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
degrees now let's take a look at the

dimming I'm doing it I'm doing it it's

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.620 
dimming I'm doing it I'm doing it it's
definitely<00:05:47.690> going<00:05:48.410> down<00:05:48.770> now<00:05:49.100> and<00:05:49.670> boom<00:05:50.450> it

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
definitely going down now and boom it

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.570 
definitely going down now and boom it
goes<00:05:50.660> out<00:05:50.960> with<00:05:51.140> a<00:05:51.230> bang<00:05:51.260> we're<00:05:52.220> at<00:05:52.280> the<00:05:52.400> bottom

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
goes out with a bang we're at the bottom

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.010 
goes out with a bang we're at the bottom
bringing<00:05:53.120> it<00:05:53.240> back<00:05:53.390> up<00:05:53.660> again

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
bringing it back up again

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.960 
bringing it back up again
and<00:05:56.890> trying<00:05:57.890> to<00:05:57.980> see<00:05:58.100> just<00:05:58.370> where<00:05:58.520> it<00:05:58.640> starts

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:58.970 
and trying to see just where it starts

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.950 
and trying to see just where it starts
to<00:05:59.120> come<00:05:59.330> on<00:06:00.490> and<00:06:01.490> then<00:06:02.360> I'm<00:06:02.540> gonna<00:06:02.630> go<00:06:02.810> back

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 
to come on and then I'm gonna go back

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:09.040 
to come on and then I'm gonna go back
down<00:06:02.990> again<00:06:03.910> that's<00:06:05.290> that's<00:06:06.290> where<00:06:07.870> it<00:06:08.870> just

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
down again that's that's where it just

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.650 
down again that's that's where it just
comes<00:06:09.350> on<00:06:09.620> and<00:06:10.240> it's<00:06:11.240> certainly<00:06:11.510> no

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:11.660 
comes on and it's certainly no

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.310 
comes on and it's certainly no
