00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.480
 Hello class! 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.100
 This is the sixth class in the matrix of numbers. 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.780
 Let's talk about interpretation of statements. 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.560
 [Artur] Hello, everyone! 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.960
 We saw in the previous classes the main foundations of mathematics. 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.340
 In addition, these are the subjects that will surely appear in the ENEM. 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:27.240
 Now, let's learn some tricks that will help you solve the exercises in a much easier way. 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.100
 For this, Matu will solve with us 2 exercises 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.160
 present in the book of Mathematics: 5 and 9, both of competence 5. 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.060
 With this we will close the examples based on equations 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.660
 and we'll make a hook for our next lesson, which is Interpreting Charts and Tables. 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.120
 For many, it is considered the essence of ENEM. 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.380
 Come on, Matu! 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.960
 [Matu] Hi guys! 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.680
 let's go to the first statement: 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.240
 An artisan who produces small sculptures in clay, 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.520
 thinking about expanding your business 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.420
 the following table to calculate your costs. 

00:01:03.454 --> 00:01:05.454
 Using the table data 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.040
 the relation between cost C and the number of N pieces produced monthly 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.960
 can be established in the mathematical sentence given by: 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.580
 a) C = 740N. 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.680
 b) C = 4 + 740N. 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.940
 c) C = 740-4. 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.920
 d) C = 4N + 740. 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.680
 e) C = 4N-740. 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.460
 Let's go step by step of the resolution. 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.220
 No error: 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.880
 The exercise is based on a table. 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.180
 You should analyze the data in this file very calmly. 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.760
 Analyzing the monthly expenses for the assistant's salary, 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.080
 energy and water, taxes and fuel, 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.420
 besides the expenses with material and packaging for each piece produced, 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.820
 we can conclude that the corresponding expression would be: 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:13.620
 450.00 + 60.00 + 160.00 + 70.00 + 3.40n + 0.60n. 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.920
 Adding the elements that have "n" 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.080
 we find 3,4n + 0,6n = 4n 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.640
 Adding the elements that do not have "n" we find the result 740.00. 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:34.080
 The final expression for cost C would be, therefore C = 740 + 4n 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.100
 alternative D 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.560
 [Yarita] You know Arthur and Matu, 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.340
 sometimes when I see long sentences or with many tables 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.600
 so I think that exercise should be difficult and step to another. 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.860
 But now I realized that in what you did for example, 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.300
 all the information was there. 

00:02:51.414 --> 00:02:56.274
 [Arthur] Yarita, one of the great secrets of mathematics is not being good at beads 

00:02:56.274 --> 00:02:57.914
 or know all the formulas, 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.020
 but you can identify the information you need in the statement. 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.775
 [Matu] He spoke and said, Arthur. 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.360
 Interpretation is the word for ENEM. 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.860
 The more you can train this, the better. 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.880
 Let's go to another example that is also cool. 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.280
 It is exercise 5 of competence 5. 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.260
 The statement says Felipe 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.800
 found some paper with some information. 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.800
 He recognized that it was the design of the land he had bought. 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.160
 Interpreting the equation expressed on paper, 

00:03:30.282 --> 00:03:34.122
 in relation to the land design data, realized that: 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.760
 (a) the area of ​​land is equal to 132 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.140
 b) the area of ​​land is equal to 120 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.660
 c) the perimeter of the land is equal to 120 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.160
 d) the perimeter of the land is equal to 132 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.680
 e) the area of ​​land is equal to 142 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.600
 [Artur] Leave this to me, Matu: 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:00.620
 Exercise 6 is based on a drawing, which represents a certain rectangular terrain. 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.600
 The exercise asks that, from the drawing, find the correct statement 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.840
 involving the concepts of area and perimeter. 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:14.580
 Looking at the drawing, we see that one side is represented by (x + 6) 

00:04:14.635 --> 00:04:16.635
 and another by (3x). 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:24.720
 In this way, to find the area would be necessary to multiply the terms: (x + 6). 3x 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.600
 Already the perimeter would be found by the sum of the sides 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:36.640
 (3x + 3x + x + 6 + x + 6) = 132. 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.780
 then the correct statement 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.116
 is the alternative D 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.100
 which says that the perimeter is equal to 132. 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.140
 [Matu] And there? 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.860
 What did you think of the tips? 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:46.834
 Cool huh? 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.420
 [Artur] Personal, the guidelines that were passed in this class 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.060
 will be the basis for us to move forward next, right? 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.660
 The transformation of statements and tables into equations 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.614
 and their possible solutions 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.740
 are present in many ENEM exercises. 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.000
 Stay tuned and see you in the next class! 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.600
 Guys, I hope you enjoyed our conversation. 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.300
 If you have questions, you can replay the lesson. 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.920
 But be sure to do the exercises and see the complementary materials, okay?
