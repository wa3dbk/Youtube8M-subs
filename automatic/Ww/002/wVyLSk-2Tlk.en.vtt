daylights everything we we give it a

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.760 
daylights everything we we give it a
tough<00:01:52.210> tough<00:01:52.660> run<00:01:52.960> for<00:01:53.170> approximately<00:01:53.740> a

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
tough tough run for approximately a

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.070 
tough tough run for approximately a
thousand<00:01:54.190> kilometres<00:01:54.580> over<00:01:54.820> some<00:01:55.659> very<00:01:55.900> very

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
thousand kilometres over some very very

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.360 
thousand kilometres over some very very
rough<00:01:56.290> conditions<00:01:56.740> and<00:01:56.890> it<00:01:56.950> takes<00:01:57.130> us<00:01:57.250> about

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
rough conditions and it takes us about

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.490 
rough conditions and it takes us about
five<00:01:57.700> days<00:01:57.909> to<00:01:58.120> do<00:01:58.240> it<00:01:58.330> so<00:01:58.510> it's<00:01:58.870> a<00:01:58.960> very<00:01:59.260> tough
