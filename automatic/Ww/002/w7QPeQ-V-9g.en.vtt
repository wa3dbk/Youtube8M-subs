00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.390
 Welcome to a new tutorial 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:07.120
 crafts for everyone today I'm going to 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.639
 show how to make a colorful mobile 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.800
 cardboard we will need for this 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:15.340
 project the following materials 4 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:19.779
 cardboard pieces of 10.5 x 14.54 in 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:22.419
 10.5 by 7.5 and 4 by 7 x 5 scissors tapes 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:25.029
 glue on bar ruler and pencil 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:26.919
 do not forget to leave your like comment and 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.300
 subscribe to my channel 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.149
 we started doubling one of the 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.460
 larger cards in half 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:35.930
 let's dial with the center rule and 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:40.210
 from there to the sides 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.210
 three centimeters and three centimeters 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.970
 then up we're going to mark a 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.970
 line of 4 and a half centimeters 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.379
 once the two lines are drawn with a 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:57.379
 scissors we are going to cut them 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.429
 and it will be like that 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.810
 then we are going to have to turn towards a 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.770
 side the center part and towards the other 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.770
 the extremes 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.409
 when we open it we will see it like this 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.299
 as a kind of ladder and we're going to 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.909
 do the same with all the pieces of 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.070
 cardboard of the same size and then what 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.110
 let's adhere to each other with glue 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.950
 in bar 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:37.320
 we are going to unite the parts in this way 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:40.490
 to join one another we do what 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.490
 same with the third piece 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.630
 and with the fourth piece 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.050
 in this short piece we are going to join one of 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.050
 the sides 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.680
 making the edges coincide 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.190
 and before adhering the last one we're going to 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.929
 place the tape for it and we're going to 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.920
 make a double knot that will serve us 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.920
 as a stop 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.470
 we put the tape in the center 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.400
 and once it's located we can already 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.400
 adhere the lips 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.730
 it would look like this 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.980
 we can decorate it by making some 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.220
 hearts with different cardboards 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:44.070
 colors or with contrasting colors 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:49.410
 we cut a heart in this case of 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:51.660
 red we open it we can see it and to 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.880
 its similarity let's cut the rest 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.030
 we place the heart on another 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.720
 cardboard and we are going to cut the same 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:07.330
 shape 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:08.550
 and so on until we get the four 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.500
 hearts 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:14.290
 then placing glue on one of the 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:18.570
 sides we're going to say right in the 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.570
 vertices as we can see here 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:27.870
 let's try to make hearts 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.870
 remain on colors that contrast 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.400
 Now we can make the same cube like 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.000
 the previous one but of a size a little 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.880
 smaller following the same process what 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.370
 What we can change is that the double 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.319
 the vertices are turned upside down and instead 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.239
 that the center is out 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:50.400
 cube lie the sides out in 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.400
 the cube in this way 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.599
 we perform four in the same way 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.890
 and then we are going to adhere 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:12.270
 in this case the glue will go in the 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:14.340
 part that is in the t- shape of this 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:17.250
 way the central part of the square 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:21.709
 stays in and the part that 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.709
 highlight would be the outer vertices 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:27.410
 again once we place the 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:30.349
 last and before adhering the last face 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.940
 let's put it on the tape then 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:34.720
 of having made a couple of knots so that 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.720
 serve as a stop 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.840
 we put glue and close it 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.660
 ah 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.530
 we say it well we could leave it like this or 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.830
 add a third link and a little more 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.830
 boy 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.390
 Y 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.440
 and ready 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.810
 in this way it would be finished 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.540
 our cardboard mobile here can 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.780
 see one very similar by the different 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.780
 colour
