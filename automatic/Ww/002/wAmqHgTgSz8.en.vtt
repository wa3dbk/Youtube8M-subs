00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
the third being the third you know what

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.959 
the third being the third you know what
I'd<00:00:45.690> imagine<00:00:46.289> if<00:00:47.100> it's<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.430> third<00:00:47.640> it'll

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
I'd imagine if it's in the third it'll

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.430 
I'd imagine if it's in the third it'll
be<00:00:48.059> like<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.210> 20-minute<00:00:48.629> time<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.230> know<00:00:49.320> it'll

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
be a legitimate time I think that one

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.689 
be a legitimate time I think that one
back<00:00:51.510> with<00:00:51.870> Nashville<00:00:52.410> when<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.370> were<00:00:53.489> Mike

minute<00:00:55.230> periods<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.710> started<00:00:56.070> in<00:00:56.160> the
