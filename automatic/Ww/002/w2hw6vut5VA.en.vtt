00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:49.169 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:52.559 

these<00:05:50.169> have<00:05:50.439> been<00:05:50.620> drills<00:05:51.009> done<00:05:51.849> for<00:05:52.090> practice

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:52.569 
these have been drills done for practice

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:54.360 
these have been drills done for practice
in<00:05:52.810> a<00:05:52.960> school<00:05:53.229> yard<00:05:53.439> where<00:05:53.770> a<00:05:53.800> real<00:05:54.099> emergency

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
in a school yard where a real emergency

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.480 
in a school yard where a real emergency
seems<00:05:54.969> pretty<00:05:55.300> far<00:05:55.629> away<00:05:56.340> but<00:05:57.340> they're

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
seems pretty far away but they're

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.409 
seems pretty far away but they're
important<00:05:58.090> I<00:05:58.469> think<00:05:59.639> you<00:06:00.639> gotta<00:06:00.909> practice

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:01.419 
important I think you gotta practice

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:04.080 
important I think you gotta practice
these<00:06:01.840> drills<00:06:02.259> because<00:06:02.469> what's<00:06:03.400> the<00:06:03.580> busk<00:06:03.849> on

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
these drills because what's the busk on

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.809 
these drills because what's the busk on
fire<00:06:04.479> everybody<00:06:05.169> might<00:06:05.979> panic<00:06:06.279> and<00:06:06.610> they

00:06:06.809 --> 00:06:06.819 
fire everybody might panic and they

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:11.939 
fire everybody might panic and they
wouldn't<00:06:07.779> get<00:06:07.900> out<00:06:08.080> in<00:06:08.289> time<00:06:10.710> some<00:06:11.710> people

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:11.949 
wouldn't get out in time some people

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:13.679 
wouldn't get out in time some people
don't<00:06:12.099> take<00:06:12.219> it<00:06:12.370> too<00:06:12.490> seriously<00:06:12.520> because<00:06:13.330> they

00:06:13.679 --> 00:06:13.689 
don't take it too seriously because they

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:18.809 
don't take it too seriously because they
think<00:06:13.749> it'll<00:06:14.080> never<00:06:14.289> happen<00:06:14.560> to<00:06:14.919> them<00:06:14.949> I<00:06:17.819> think

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:18.819 
think it'll never happen to them I think

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:20.879 
think it'll never happen to them I think
it's<00:06:18.939> important<00:06:19.509> because<00:06:19.810> if<00:06:20.080> a<00:06:20.199> bus<00:06:20.409> was<00:06:20.650> in<00:06:20.800> a

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:20.889 
it's important because if a bus was in a

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:23.040 
it's important because if a bus was in a
wreck<00:06:21.099> and<00:06:21.460> if<00:06:22.090> the<00:06:22.330> kids<00:06:22.569> didn't<00:06:22.840> know<00:06:22.930> what

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.050 
wreck and if the kids didn't know what

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.959 
wreck and if the kids didn't know what
to<00:06:23.169> do<00:06:23.379> then<00:06:23.919> they<00:06:24.099> could<00:06:24.370> all<00:06:24.490> be<00:06:24.520> tumbling

00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:24.969 
to do then they could all be tumbling

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:25.950 
to do then they could all be tumbling
and<00:06:25.180> yelling<00:06:25.389> at<00:06:25.479> each<00:06:25.509> other<00:06:25.659> and<00:06:25.840> just

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960 
and yelling at each other and just

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:31.469 
and yelling at each other and just
panicking<00:06:26.590> I<00:06:29.699> think<00:06:30.699> it's<00:06:30.849> a<00:06:30.939> good<00:06:31.060> idea<00:06:31.270> to

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:31.479 
panicking I think it's a good idea to

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:33.300 
panicking I think it's a good idea to
practice<00:06:31.779> because<00:06:32.439> if<00:06:32.590> you<00:06:32.770> really<00:06:33.129> that's

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
practice because if you really that's

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.369 
practice because if you really that's
the<00:06:33.580> kind<00:06:33.819> of<00:06:33.879> railroad<00:06:34.150> track<00:06:34.599> you<00:06:34.810> do<00:06:35.020> it<00:06:35.199> to

00:06:35.369 --> 00:06:35.379 
the kind of railroad track you do it to

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:39.899 
the kind of railroad track you do it to
do<00:06:37.439> it<00:06:38.439> takes<00:06:38.650> practice<00:06:38.949> to<00:06:39.250> be<00:06:39.490> able<00:06:39.580> to<00:06:39.729> get

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:39.909 
do it takes practice to be able to get

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:43.770 
do it takes practice to be able to get
out<00:06:40.029> of<00:06:40.120> a<00:06:40.210> school<00:06:40.479> bus<00:06:40.689> in<00:06:41.110> a<00:06:41.259> real<00:06:41.469> emergency
