00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:09.160
 one of the strangest syndromes that 

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:10.810
 we can find today the 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.720
 People with the syndrome 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:17.050
 netherton have serious problems in the 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:20.349
 skin in principle have a dose that 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:24.220
 causes the skin to be red and it 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:26.169
 escape like a fish usually have 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.679
 serious skin problems as I have already 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:33.940
 said pains and also in the case of 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:36.250
 Netherton syndrome is a great big 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.770
 increases and decreases in weight so 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.200
 As much as you can see, it's a problem 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.290
 pretty serious today I'm going to talk about 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.610
 of a real case a real case that the 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.760
 it has really caught my attention 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.980
 you can see in the next photo the photo 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.890
 of a child suffering from the syndrome of 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:58.440
 netherton 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:01.199
 was born in the United Kingdom - and this is this child 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.110
 Specifically, he is Julie's son and 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.110
 danielle a couple who decided to have 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.570
 a son without imagining that he would be born with 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.420
 this syndrome 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.790
 the truth is that this syndrome is going to 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.890
 generate a lot of problems at 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.100
 throughout his life to start there are 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.960
 to feed him the right calories 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.990
 you have to be constantly with a 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.900
 dietitian and carrying the reviews for 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.540
 see if everything works properly in the 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.540
 most cases have to apply 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.940
 bandages through the body to prevent it from 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.310
 ulcer is to say that it comes out 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.930
 blood from your skin because your skin gets 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.300
 cracks and flakes 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.580
 a very unpleasant disease that 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.050
 generates itching that can not be 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.850
 endure 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.760
 a skin disease that to say 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.730
 true to this day does not have any 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.620
 cure you can take some creams and you 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.440
 can take some medication to 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:04.910
 avoid itching and inflammation but 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:07.190
 apart from that there is nothing else one of the 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:10.460
 more rare diseases that we can 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.110
 find today and that's why the 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:16.000
