00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
we're gonna be talking about foam

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.070 
we're gonna be talking about foam
rollers<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:14.940> some<00:00:15.120> of<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.269> benefits<00:00:15.750> in

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
rollers and some of the benefits in

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.260 
rollers and some of the benefits in
using<00:00:16.560> these<00:00:16.680> for<00:00:17.190> your<00:00:17.369> stretching<00:00:17.880> or<00:00:18.090> in

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
using these for your stretching or in

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.960 
using these for your stretching or in
within<00:00:18.570> your<00:00:18.840> stretching<00:00:19.260> routine<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.970> one

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
within your stretching routine and one

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.670 
within your stretching routine and one
of<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:21.300> was<00:00:21.390> first<00:00:21.750> exposed<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.230> these<00:00:22.410> back

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
of the I was first exposed to these back

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.109 
of the I was first exposed to these back
in<00:00:22.890> roughly<00:00:23.430> 2004<00:00:24.240> or<00:00:24.359> so<00:00:24.570> when<00:00:25.380> I<00:00:25.410> was<00:00:25.500> at<00:00:25.740> buds

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
in roughly 2004 or so when I was at buds

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.210 
in roughly 2004 or so when I was at buds
basically<00:00:27.119> as<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.599> way<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.869> alleviate<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:29.039> pain

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
basically as a way to alleviate the pain

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.860 
basically as a way to alleviate the pain
from<00:00:29.580> ITB<00:00:30.449> or<00:00:30.689> iliotibial<00:00:31.170> band<00:00:31.590> syndrome<00:00:31.859> so

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
from ITB or iliotibial band syndrome so

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.600 
from ITB or iliotibial band syndrome so
ITB<00:00:33.870> is<00:00:34.050> commonly<00:00:34.500> also<00:00:34.829> referred<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.190> as<00:00:35.370> I

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
ITB is commonly also referred to as I

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.380 
ITB is commonly also referred to as I
tried<00:00:35.910> buds<00:00:36.530> because<00:00:37.530> it's<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.860> common

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
tried buds because it's a common

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.229 
tried buds because it's a common
overtraining<00:00:40.100> issue<00:00:41.100> or<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.579> syndrome<00:00:41.969> that

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
overtraining issue or a syndrome that

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.450 
overtraining issue or a syndrome that
develops<00:00:42.719> there<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.100> basically<00:00:44.100> if<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.280> look

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
develops there and basically if you look

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.000 
develops there and basically if you look
at<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.850> human<00:00:45.300> body<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.660> iliotibial<00:00:45.989> band<00:00:46.410> is

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
at the human body the iliotibial band is

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.910 
at the human body the iliotibial band is
what<00:00:47.850> runs<00:00:48.059> down<00:00:48.390> from<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.079> hip<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.890> knee

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
what runs down from the hip to the knee

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.549 
what runs down from the hip to the knee
on<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.579> outside<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.149> leg<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:51.500> using<00:00:52.500> a

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
on the outside of the leg so using a

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.110 
on the outside of the leg so using a
foam<00:00:52.800> roller<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.250> can<00:00:53.430> typically<00:00:53.730> stretch

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
foam roller you can typically stretch

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.029 
foam roller you can typically stretch
out<00:00:54.360> this<00:00:54.510> area<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:56.719> you'll<00:00:57.719> be<00:00:57.870> able<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.350> kind

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
out this area and you'll be able to kind

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.470 
out this area and you'll be able to kind
of<00:00:59.070> alleviate<00:00:59.340> some<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.789> that<00:00:59.910> pain<00:01:00.000> that's

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
of alleviate some of that pain that's

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.869 
of alleviate some of that pain that's
associated<00:01:00.809> with<00:01:01.140> ITB<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.160> found<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.730> that

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
associated with ITB so I found that that

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.640 
associated with ITB so I found that that
helped<00:01:03.149> me<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.270> didn't<00:01:03.629> develop<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:04.110> severe<00:01:04.439> case

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
helped me I didn't develop a severe case

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.350 
helped me I didn't develop a severe case
of<00:01:04.710> ITB<00:01:05.309> but<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.549> did<00:01:05.790> have<00:01:06.000> some<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.299> the

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
of ITB but I did have some of the

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.020 
of ITB but I did have some of the
symptoms<00:01:06.659> behind<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:08.340> let's<00:01:08.760> kind<00:01:08.939> of

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
symptoms behind that so let's kind of

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.490 
symptoms behind that so let's kind of

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.370 
second phase at the tail end so I got
through<00:01:30.060> hell<00:01:30.299> week<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.630> all<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.869> stuff<00:01:31.140> but

accuses me of being a seal and not being
so<00:01:39.590> anyway<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:41.040> use<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.220> foam<00:01:41.549> roller<00:01:42.649> also

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
so anyway to use a foam roller also

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:44.899 
so anyway to use a foam roller also
first<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:44.009> want<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.189> go<00:01:44.310> over<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.610> there<00:01:44.790> are

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
first I want to go over that there are

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.190 
first I want to go over that there are
different<00:01:45.210> types<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.600> foam<00:01:45.750> rollers<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:46.140> you

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
different types of foam rollers so you

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.410 
different types of foam rollers so you
can<00:01:46.350> see<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:46.950> have<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.460> second<00:01:47.909> type<00:01:48.090> here

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
can see that I have a second type here

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.609 
can see that I have a second type here
and<00:01:48.680> the<00:01:49.680> difference<00:01:50.070> in<00:01:50.220> these<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:50.880> just

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
and the difference in these is just

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.920 
and the difference in these is just
basically<00:01:52.619> how<00:01:52.740> sturdy<00:01:53.040> they<00:01:53.280> are<00:01:53.430> how

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
basically how sturdy they are how

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.469 
basically how sturdy they are how
compressible<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.049> foam<00:01:55.290> is<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:55.829> as<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.479> move

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
compressible the foam is so as you move

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.910 
compressible the foam is so as you move
to<00:01:57.719> different<00:01:58.079> types<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.409> foam<00:01:58.590> rollers

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
to different types of foam rollers

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.649 
to different types of foam rollers
you'll<00:01:59.100> find<00:01:59.340> some<00:01:59.579> that<00:01:59.700> are<00:01:59.820> a<00:02:00.090> little<00:02:00.450> bit

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
you'll find some that are a little bit

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.090 
you'll find some that are a little bit
more<00:02:00.899> rigid<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.409> some<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:01.829> are<00:02:01.950> more

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
more rigid and some that are more

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.639 
more rigid and some that are more
flexible<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:02.969> this<00:02:03.689> white<00:02:03.960> one<00:02:04.170> here<00:02:04.350> is<00:02:04.530> an

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
flexible so this white one here is an

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.980 
flexible so this white one here is an
example<00:02:05.070> of<00:02:05.159> one<00:02:05.369> that's<00:02:05.399> pretty<00:02:06.210> pretty

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
example of one that's pretty pretty

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.139 
example of one that's pretty pretty
flexible<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.770> this<00:02:08.190> is<00:02:08.369> probably<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.759> the

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
flexible and this is probably the the

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.210 
flexible and this is probably the the
low<00:02:09.330> grade<00:02:09.709> in<00:02:10.709> terms<00:02:11.099> of<00:02:11.450> stiffness

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
low grade in terms of stiffness

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.250 
low grade in terms of stiffness
and<00:02:13.310> then<00:02:13.430> you<00:02:13.610> can<00:02:13.820> go<00:02:13.970> up<00:02:14.120> to<00:02:14.300> ones<00:02:14.690> that<00:02:14.840> are

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
and then you can go up to ones that are

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.970 
and then you can go up to ones that are
even<00:02:15.410> made<00:02:15.740> out<00:02:15.950> of<00:02:16.130> a<00:02:16.970> hard<00:02:17.480> inner<00:02:17.810> core<00:02:18.200> just

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
even made out of a hard inner core just

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.820 
even made out of a hard inner core just
wrapped<00:02:19.310> with<00:02:19.720> something<00:02:20.720> that's<00:02:20.900> somewhat

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
wrapped with something that's somewhat

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.500 
wrapped with something that's somewhat
like<00:02:22.010> a<00:02:22.040> yoga<00:02:22.550> mat<00:02:22.730> or<00:02:22.760> so<00:02:23.060> and<00:02:23.330> you<00:02:23.390> can

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
like a yoga mat or so and you can

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.080 
like a yoga mat or so and you can
actually<00:02:23.660> make<00:02:24.020> your<00:02:24.050> own<00:02:24.230> -<00:02:24.590> if<00:02:24.740> you<00:02:24.830> get<00:02:25.010> a

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
actually make your own - if you get a

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.060 
actually make your own - if you get a
good<00:02:26.090> size<00:02:26.330> PVC<00:02:26.960> pipe<00:02:27.200> you<00:02:27.410> can<00:02:27.440> actually<00:02:27.710> wrap

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
good size PVC pipe you can actually wrap

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.410 
good size PVC pipe you can actually wrap
that<00:02:28.340> with<00:02:28.580> some<00:02:29.470> I<00:02:30.470> guess<00:02:31.010> like<00:02:31.460> yoga<00:02:31.880> mat

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
that with some I guess like yoga mat

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.960 
that with some I guess like yoga mat
like<00:02:32.690> material<00:02:33.320> something<00:02:33.560> like<00:02:33.800> that<00:02:34.040> some

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
like material something like that some

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.540 
like material something like that some
type<00:02:35.150> of<00:02:35.180> foam<00:02:35.570> and<00:02:35.870> just<00:02:36.770> put<00:02:37.100> some<00:02:37.250> spray

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
type of foam and just put some spray

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:38.770 
type of foam and just put some spray
glue<00:02:37.730> on<00:02:37.880> it<00:02:37.910> maybe<00:02:38.150> you<00:02:38.240> will<00:02:38.360> do<00:02:38.480> that<00:02:38.630> as<00:02:38.750> a

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
glue on it maybe you will do that as a

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.650 
glue on it maybe you will do that as a
DIY<00:02:39.140> one<00:02:39.560> day<00:02:39.740> on<00:02:39.920> I<00:02:40.130> TS<00:02:40.400> but<00:02:40.670> anyway<00:02:41.480> you<00:02:41.540> can

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
DIY one day on I TS but anyway you can

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.540 
DIY one day on I TS but anyway you can
do<00:02:42.050> that<00:02:42.230> too<00:02:42.470> so<00:02:42.710> that's<00:02:43.010> just<00:02:43.160> to<00:02:43.370> illustrate

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
do that too so that's just to illustrate

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.780 
do that too so that's just to illustrate
that<00:02:44.000> there<00:02:44.120> are<00:02:44.270> different<00:02:44.630> levels<00:02:44.750> of

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
that there are different levels of

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.520 
that there are different levels of
stiffness<00:02:46.790> and<00:02:47.180> I<00:02:47.420> wouldn't<00:02:48.200> necessarily

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
stiffness and I wouldn't necessarily

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.670 
stiffness and I wouldn't necessarily
recommend<00:02:48.680> just<00:02:49.340> using<00:02:49.730> a<00:02:49.790> PVC<00:02:50.090> pipe<00:02:50.450> that<00:02:50.750> can

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
recommend just using a PVC pipe that can

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.040 
recommend just using a PVC pipe that can
be<00:02:51.980> kind<00:02:52.610> of<00:02:52.670> abrasive<00:02:53.209> against<00:02:53.750> your<00:02:53.870> skin

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
be kind of abrasive against your skin

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.210 
be kind of abrasive against your skin
and<00:02:54.110> stuff<00:02:54.410> when<00:02:54.530> you're<00:02:54.620> rolling<00:02:54.950> with<00:02:54.980> these

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
and stuff when you're rolling with these

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.670 
and stuff when you're rolling with these
things<00:02:55.490> but<00:02:56.020> that<00:02:57.020> just<00:02:57.320> wanted<00:02:57.470> to<00:02:57.560> let<00:02:57.620> you

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
things but that just wanted to let you

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.470 
things but that just wanted to let you
know<00:02:57.830> about<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.400> the<00:02:58.730> different<00:02:59.090> types<00:02:59.300> of

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
know about the the different types of

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.390 
know about the the different types of
foam<00:02:59.660> rollers<00:02:59.990> but<00:03:00.260> be<00:03:00.770> demonstrating<00:03:01.340> on

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
foam rollers but be demonstrating on

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.610 
foam rollers but be demonstrating on
this<00:03:01.610> one<00:03:01.820> and<00:03:02.120> this<00:03:02.270> is<00:03:02.330> kind<00:03:03.080> of<00:03:03.140> my<00:03:03.230> favorite

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
this one and this is kind of my favorite

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.350 
this one and this is kind of my favorite
it's<00:03:03.740> the<00:03:03.860> most<00:03:04.010> flexible<00:03:04.160> and<00:03:04.640> I<00:03:04.730> like<00:03:04.910> it<00:03:05.090> the

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
it's the most flexible and I like it the

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.010 
it's the most flexible and I like it the
most<00:03:06.220> depending<00:03:07.220> on<00:03:07.340> what<00:03:07.610> I'm<00:03:07.790> rolling<00:03:08.660> what

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
most depending on what I'm rolling what

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.810 
most depending on what I'm rolling what
specific<00:03:09.500> muscle<00:03:09.830> group<00:03:10.040> I'm<00:03:10.220> rolling<00:03:10.520> I<00:03:10.640> will

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
specific muscle group I'm rolling I will

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.610 
specific muscle group I'm rolling I will
kind<00:03:11.090> of<00:03:11.209> use<00:03:11.390> the<00:03:11.570> stiffer<00:03:11.810> one<00:03:12.080> that<00:03:12.410> I<00:03:12.470> have

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
kind of use the stiffer one that I have

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.190 
kind of use the stiffer one that I have
here<00:03:12.770> too<00:03:12.980> with<00:03:13.190> this<00:03:13.310> black<00:03:13.550> one<00:03:13.730> so<00:03:14.690> the

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
here too with this black one so the

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.960 
here too with this black one so the
different<00:03:15.530> things<00:03:15.709> that<00:03:15.920> I<00:03:15.980> do<00:03:16.130> personally<00:03:16.580> on

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
different things that I do personally on

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.340 
different things that I do personally on
these<00:03:17.170> is<00:03:18.170> to<00:03:18.500> roll<00:03:18.920> out<00:03:19.070> the<00:03:19.310> ITB<00:03:20.000> band<00:03:20.390> when

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
these is to roll out the ITB band when

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:22.570 
these is to roll out the ITB band when
I'm<00:03:21.470> working<00:03:21.739> out<00:03:21.830> and<00:03:21.890> stuff<00:03:22.160> like<00:03:22.310> that<00:03:22.459> I'll

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
I'm working out and stuff like that I'll

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.210 
I'm working out and stuff like that I'll
usually<00:03:22.910> do<00:03:23.030> this<00:03:23.180> after<00:03:23.600> workouts<00:03:24.019> I<00:03:24.320> find

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
usually do this after workouts I find

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.440 
usually do this after workouts I find
that<00:03:25.310> that's<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.580> best<00:03:25.760> not<00:03:26.090> only<00:03:26.120> the<00:03:26.330> best

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
that that's the best not only the best

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:27.790 
that that's the best not only the best
time<00:03:26.600> to<00:03:26.720> stretch<00:03:26.989> but<00:03:27.230> also<00:03:27.380> the<00:03:27.560> best<00:03:27.709> time

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
time to stretch but also the best time

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.449 
time to stretch but also the best time
to<00:03:28.130> use<00:03:28.160> one<00:03:28.610> of<00:03:28.640> these<00:03:28.730> foam<00:03:28.970> rollers<00:03:29.269> as<00:03:29.420> well

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
to use one of these foam rollers as well

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.490 
to use one of these foam rollers as well
so<00:03:31.459> specifically<00:03:32.180> what<00:03:32.390> I<00:03:32.600> like<00:03:32.930> to<00:03:33.050> do<00:03:33.200> is

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
so specifically what I like to do is

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.150 
so specifically what I like to do is
target<00:03:33.920> kind<00:03:34.730> of<00:03:34.820> the<00:03:34.970> the<00:03:35.480> front<00:03:35.810> here<00:03:36.080> on<00:03:37.010> my

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
target kind of the the front here on my

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.270 
target kind of the the front here on my
shins<00:03:37.720> also<00:03:38.720> that<00:03:38.870> ITB<00:03:39.380> band<00:03:39.620> that<00:03:40.100> I<00:03:40.130> was

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
shins also that ITB band that I was

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.920 
shins also that ITB band that I was
telling<00:03:40.459> you<00:03:40.610> runs<00:03:40.880> from<00:03:41.150> the<00:03:41.390> hip<00:03:41.570> all<00:03:41.840> the

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
telling you runs from the hip all the

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.840 
telling you runs from the hip all the
way<00:03:42.049> down<00:03:42.260> to<00:03:42.500> the<00:03:42.650> top<00:03:42.830> of<00:03:42.980> the<00:03:43.040> knee<00:03:43.190> then

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
way down to the top of the knee then

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.000 
way down to the top of the knee then
I'll<00:03:43.970> also<00:03:44.150> sometimes<00:03:44.720> get<00:03:44.959> quads<00:03:45.410> and<00:03:45.769> stuff

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
I'll also sometimes get quads and stuff

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.250 
I'll also sometimes get quads and stuff
like<00:03:46.160> that<00:03:46.400> and<00:03:46.640> even<00:03:46.880> caps<00:03:47.330> and<00:03:47.900> I'll<00:03:48.110> show

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
like that and even caps and I'll show

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.080 
like that and even caps and I'll show
you<00:03:48.290> that<00:03:48.410> so<00:03:48.830> I'm<00:03:49.340> actually<00:03:49.549> going<00:03:49.820> to<00:03:49.910> flip

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
you that so I'm actually going to flip

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.430 
you that so I'm actually going to flip
this<00:03:50.209> around<00:03:50.360> so<00:03:50.720> you<00:03:50.750> can<00:03:50.930> see<00:03:51.140> this<00:03:51.260> a<00:03:51.320> little

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
this around so you can see this a little

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.490 
this around so you can see this a little
better<00:03:51.709> from<00:03:52.489> the<00:03:52.580> side<00:03:52.790> so<00:03:53.299> when<00:03:54.110> I<00:03:54.140> start<00:03:54.410> out

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
better from the side so when I start out

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.590 
better from the side so when I start out
foam<00:03:54.860> rolling<00:03:55.070> this<00:03:55.250> stuff<00:03:55.459> I'm<00:03:55.700> usually<00:03:56.120> in

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
foam rolling this stuff I'm usually in

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.930 
foam rolling this stuff I'm usually in
this<00:03:56.810> position<00:03:57.260> you<00:03:58.070> can<00:03:58.220> just<00:03:58.370> move<00:03:58.519> back<00:03:58.790> and

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
this position you can just move back and

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.650 
this position you can just move back and
forth<00:03:59.180> like<00:03:59.269> that<00:03:59.570> to<00:03:59.810> get<00:03:59.900> your<00:04:00.110> shins<00:04:01.660> then

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
forth like that to get your shins then

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.410 
forth like that to get your shins then
I'll<00:04:02.780> just<00:04:02.959> extend<00:04:03.230> it<00:04:03.530> and<00:04:04.060> roll<00:04:05.060> all<00:04:05.239> the<00:04:05.269> way

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
I'll just extend it and roll all the way

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.240 
I'll just extend it and roll all the way
down<00:04:05.540> here<00:04:06.260> just<00:04:07.360> like<00:04:08.360> that<00:04:08.600> and<00:04:08.870> then<00:04:09.470> ITB

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
down here just like that and then ITB

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.750 
down here just like that and then ITB
I'll<00:04:10.700> get<00:04:11.000> the<00:04:11.120> outside<00:04:11.570> of<00:04:11.750> my<00:04:12.400> calf's<00:04:13.400> there

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
I'll get the outside of my calf's there

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.280 
I'll get the outside of my calf's there
and<00:04:14.060> then<00:04:14.510> go<00:04:14.690> all<00:04:14.900> the<00:04:15.080> way<00:04:15.190> and<00:04:16.190> roll<00:04:16.370> across

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
and then go all the way and roll across

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.740 
and then go all the way and roll across
into<00:04:18.290> the<00:04:18.320> ITB

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
into the ITB

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.110 
into the ITB
and<00:04:20.750> I'll<00:04:20.840> usually<00:04:20.989> switch<00:04:21.440> that<00:04:21.650> up<00:04:21.709> and<00:04:22.120> go

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
and I'll usually switch that up and go

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.100 
and I'll usually switch that up and go
to<00:04:23.180> the<00:04:23.300> other<00:04:23.450> side

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.580 

like<00:04:26.229> that<00:04:26.439> and<00:04:26.650> then<00:04:27.009> you<00:04:27.099> can<00:04:27.219> also<00:04:28.590> start

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
like that and then you can also start

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.670 
like that and then you can also start
out<00:04:29.740> like<00:04:29.889> this<00:04:31.919> and<00:04:32.919> get<00:04:33.099> quads<00:04:33.400> too<00:04:34.650> now<00:04:35.650> you

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
out like this and get quads too now you

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.409 
out like this and get quads too now you
might<00:04:36.099> want<00:04:36.280> to<00:04:36.310> go<00:04:36.490> with<00:04:36.520> a<00:04:36.639> stiffer<00:04:37.000> one<00:04:37.330> for

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
might want to go with a stiffer one for

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.670 
might want to go with a stiffer one for
your<00:04:40.419> hamstrings<00:04:40.900> sorry<00:04:41.229> I<00:04:41.289> called<00:04:41.469> those

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
your hamstrings sorry I called those

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:48.570 
your hamstrings sorry I called those
quads<00:04:43.740> hamstrings<00:04:44.740> and<00:04:45.159> calves<00:04:46.800> but<00:04:47.800> the<00:04:48.009> the

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
quads hamstrings and calves but the the

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.029 
quads hamstrings and calves but the the
stronger<00:04:48.969> one<00:04:49.150> will<00:04:49.300> be<00:04:49.389> better<00:04:49.569> for<00:04:49.949> for<00:04:50.949> that

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 
stronger one will be better for for that

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:53.640 
stronger one will be better for for that
type<00:04:51.340> of<00:04:51.370> area<00:04:51.909> too<00:04:52.389> so<00:04:52.870> there<00:04:53.439> is<00:04:53.620> a

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
type of area too so there is a

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.820 
type of area too so there is a
difference<00:04:54.069> there<00:04:54.280> and<00:04:54.550> you'll<00:04:55.270> notice<00:04:55.479> that

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
difference there and you'll notice that

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.980 
difference there and you'll notice that
you'll<00:04:56.830> feel<00:04:57.099> the<00:04:57.400> the<00:04:58.030> front<00:04:58.330> groups<00:04:58.719> like

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
you'll feel the the front groups like

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.290 
you'll feel the the front groups like
the<00:04:59.110> ITB<00:04:59.439> and<00:04:59.800> the<00:04:59.949> the<00:05:00.639> shins<00:05:00.909> you'll<00:05:01.120> feel

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
the ITB and the the shins you'll feel

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.719 
the ITB and the the shins you'll feel
those<00:05:01.479> a<00:05:01.509> lot<00:05:01.750> more<00:05:02.050> with<00:05:02.259> the<00:05:02.560> softer<00:05:03.520> roller

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729 
those a lot more with the softer roller

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:07.439 
those a lot more with the softer roller
and<00:05:05.189> you'll<00:05:06.189> need<00:05:06.370> kind<00:05:06.669> of<00:05:06.729> a<00:05:06.819> harder<00:05:07.060> one<00:05:07.240> for

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:07.449 
and you'll need kind of a harder one for

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:09.839 
and you'll need kind of a harder one for
the<00:05:07.539> other<00:05:07.629> areas<00:05:08.080> so<00:05:08.370> that's<00:05:09.370> just<00:05:09.610> a<00:05:09.699> brief
