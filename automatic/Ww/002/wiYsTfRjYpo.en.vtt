getting airjitzu so you kind of use a

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.069 
getting airjitzu so you kind of use a
rip<00:00:37.590> cord<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.100> they<00:00:38.969> fly<00:00:39.540> up<00:00:39.570> into<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.050> air

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
like they're in their energy form from

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.520 
like they're in their energy form from
like<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.490> 2012<00:01:33.180> waves<00:01:33.810> they<00:01:34.200> had<00:01:34.350> their

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
like the 2012 waves they had their

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.530 
like the 2012 waves they had their
energy<00:01:34.860> but<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.460> suits<00:01:36.210> are<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.420> little

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
energy but the suits are a little

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.330 
energy but the suits are a little
different<00:01:36.689> but<00:01:37.320> like<00:01:37.500> their<00:01:37.650> faces<00:01:38.070> locate

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
different but like their faces locate

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.230 
different but like their faces locate
their<00:01:38.520> in<00:01:38.610> their<00:01:38.729> energy<00:01:39.090> form<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:41.240> makes

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
their in their energy form so it makes

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.030 
their in their energy form so it makes
me<00:01:42.420> wonder<00:01:42.600> if<00:01:42.780> these<00:01:42.869> airjitzu<00:01:43.530> will<00:01:43.890> be

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
me wonder if these airjitzu will be

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.859 
me wonder if these airjitzu will be
doing<00:01:44.280> like<00:01:44.549> they'll<00:01:44.820> be<00:01:44.970> using<00:01:45.000> diff

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
doing like they'll be using diff

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.210 
doing like they'll be using diff
something<00:01:46.259> totally<00:01:46.680> different<00:01:46.860> with<00:01:47.070> their

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
something totally different with their

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.990 
something totally different with their
powers<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.759> have<00:01:48.450> this<00:01:48.600> airjitzu<00:01:49.110> so<00:01:50.000> they

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
powers to have this airjitzu so they

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.999 
powers to have this airjitzu so they

the final fight for the destinies bounty

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.750 
the final fight for the destinies bounty
looks<00:02:44.140> like<00:02:44.260> it<00:02:44.379> has<00:02:44.500> a<00:02:44.530> ton<00:02:45.099> of<00:02:45.129> pieces<00:02:45.670> I

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
looks like it has a ton of pieces I

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.220 
looks like it has a ton of pieces I
think<00:02:46.060> it<00:02:46.180> might<00:02:46.329> be<00:02:46.359> the<00:02:46.569> biggest<00:02:46.690> set<00:02:47.049> for

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
think it might be the biggest set for

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.220 
think it might be the biggest set for
Ninjago<00:02:47.650> ever<00:02:47.829> created<00:02:48.750> because<00:02:49.750> it<00:02:49.989> has<00:02:50.079> like

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
Ninjago ever created because it has like

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.710 
Ninjago ever created because it has like
a<00:02:50.290> thousand<00:02:50.709> two<00:02:50.799> hundred<00:02:50.829> something<00:02:51.459> I<00:02:51.720> think

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
a thousand two hundred something I think

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.569 
a thousand two hundred something I think
it<00:02:52.810> may<00:02:52.959> be<00:02:52.989> above<00:02:53.409> the<00:02:53.440> battle<00:02:54.159> for<00:02:54.280> Ninjago

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
it may be above the battle for Ninjago

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:57.509 
it may be above the battle for Ninjago
city<00:02:54.700> so<00:02:55.650> it's<00:02:56.650> it's<00:02:56.889> I<00:02:57.099> think<00:02:57.220> it's<00:02:57.370> the

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
city so it's it's I think it's the

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.160 
city so it's it's I think it's the
biggest<00:02:57.849> set<00:02:58.030> they've<00:02:58.180> had<00:02:58.359> so<00:02:58.690> far<00:02:58.870> for

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
biggest set they've had so far for

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.640 
biggest set they've had so far for

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
the moral dragon is seventy dollars I

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.640 
the moral dragon is seventy dollars I
think<00:04:07.750> that's<00:04:07.900> pretty<00:04:08.049> good<00:04:08.230> deal<00:04:08.409> for

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
think that's pretty good deal for

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.379 
think that's pretty good deal for
looking<00:04:09.310> at<00:04:09.430> the<00:04:09.549> moral<00:04:09.790> dragon<00:04:10.120> because<00:04:10.209> it

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:10.389 
looking at the moral dragon because it

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:13.259 
looking at the moral dragon because it
looks<00:04:10.540> awesome<00:04:10.720> and<00:04:11.489> the<00:04:12.489> air<00:04:12.639> jet<00:04:12.849> suits<00:04:13.120> are

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
looks awesome and the air jet suits are

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.240 
looks awesome and the air jet suits are
only<00:04:13.389> ten<00:04:13.659> dollars<00:04:14.049> so<00:04:14.650> I<00:04:14.680> thought<00:04:15.069> it<00:04:15.220> would

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
only ten dollars so I thought it would

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.770 
only ten dollars so I thought it would
be<00:04:15.370> like<00:04:15.489> maybe<00:04:15.699> fifteen<00:04:16.120> dollars<00:04:16.449> because<00:04:16.599> it

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
be like maybe fifteen dollars because it

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.069 
be like maybe fifteen dollars because it
looks<00:04:16.930> like<00:04:17.049> kind<00:04:17.229> of<00:04:17.260> like<00:04:17.349> a<00:04:18.599> function<00:04:19.599> sort

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
looks like kind of like a function sort

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.629 
looks like kind of like a function sort
of<00:04:20.199> set<00:04:20.560> that<00:04:20.709> would<00:04:20.829> be<00:04:20.919> you<00:04:21.039> around<00:04:21.219> fifteen

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
of set that would be you around fifteen

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:23.470 
of set that would be you around fifteen
dollars<00:04:21.969> but<00:04:22.150> they<00:04:22.270> kept<00:04:22.479> it<00:04:22.599> at<00:04:22.690> ten

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
dollars but they kept it at ten

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.930 
dollars but they kept it at ten
so<00:04:23.630> they<00:04:24.410> will<00:04:24.530> be<00:04:24.590> as<00:04:24.800> much<00:04:25.100> as<00:04:25.310> spinners<00:04:25.730> were

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
so they will be as much as spinners were

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.830 
so they will be as much as spinners were
back<00:04:26.570> in<00:04:26.600> 2012<00:04:27.380> so<00:04:27.710> that's<00:04:27.890> nice<00:04:28.160> so<00:04:29.060> yes<00:04:29.480> so<00:04:29.750> if

to get figures easier some some figures

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.760 
to get figures easier some some figures
easier<00:04:46.040> now<00:04:46.760> there's<00:04:47.210> also<00:04:47.450> the<00:04:47.870> most<00:04:48.440> of<00:04:48.680> this
