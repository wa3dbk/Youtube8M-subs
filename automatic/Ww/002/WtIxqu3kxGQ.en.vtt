this<00:01:48.299> makes<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.810> game<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.049> little<00:01:49.290> more

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
this makes the game a little more

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.800 
this makes the game a little more
artificially<00:01:50.549> hard<00:01:50.909> but<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.420> controls

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
aren't bad they're just not up to really

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.090 
before in the first level I think one of
the<00:03:47.600> reasons<00:03:47.930> I<00:03:48.019> love<00:03:48.200> Strider<00:03:48.560> so<00:03:48.769> much<00:03:48.920> is

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
the reasons I love Strider so much is

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.759 
the reasons I love Strider so much is
that<00:03:49.459> he<00:03:49.579> can<00:03:49.730> go<00:03:49.850> anywhere<00:03:50.510> not<00:03:50.930> only<00:03:51.290> because

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
that he can go anywhere not only because

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.410 
that he can go anywhere not only because
he<00:03:51.950> can<00:03:52.130> jump<00:03:52.430> really<00:03:52.670> far<00:03:52.790> but<00:03:53.090> he<00:03:53.239> can

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
he can jump really far but he can

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.770 
he can jump really far but he can
basically<00:03:53.630> latch<00:03:54.350> on<00:03:54.739> to<00:03:55.100> any<00:03:55.639> hard<00:03:56.359> surface

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
basically latch on to any hard surface

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.500 
basically latch on to any hard surface
in<00:03:57.290> the<00:03:57.590> game<00:03:57.799> he<00:03:58.250> can<00:03:58.400> climb<00:03:58.639> on<00:03:58.819> walls<00:03:59.180> and

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
in the game he can climb on walls and

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.990 
in the game he can climb on walls and
ceilings<00:04:00.170> whatever<00:04:00.650> there's<00:04:01.040> a<00:04:01.100> hard<00:04:01.489> surface

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
ceilings whatever there's a hard surface

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.720 
ceilings whatever there's a hard surface
to<00:04:02.030> grab<00:04:02.510> onto<00:04:02.780> he<00:04:03.530> will<00:04:03.739> grab<00:04:04.040> onto<00:04:04.310> it<00:04:04.609> and

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
to grab onto he will grab onto it and

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.690 
to grab onto he will grab onto it and
this<00:04:05.209> becomes<00:04:05.420> extra<00:04:06.260> badass<00:04:06.709> when<00:04:07.220> he's<00:04:07.430> up

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
this becomes extra badass when he's up

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.449 
this becomes extra badass when he's up
in<00:04:07.850> the<00:04:07.910> air<00:04:08.139> climbing<00:04:09.139> around<00:04:09.440> on<00:04:09.769> flying

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
in the air climbing around on flying

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.090 
in the air climbing around on flying
machinery<00:04:11.299> where<00:04:11.840> any<00:04:12.079> poor<00:04:12.470> move<00:04:12.739> where<00:04:13.069> you

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
machinery where any poor move where you

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.550 
machinery where any poor move where you
don't<00:04:13.459> judge<00:04:13.819> your<00:04:14.030> jump<00:04:14.420> perfectly<00:04:14.840> will

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
don't judge your jump perfectly will

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.310 
don't judge your jump perfectly will
result<00:04:16.010> in<00:04:16.280> like<00:04:16.579> a<00:04:16.780> 5,000<00:04:17.780> foot<00:04:17.959> drop<00:04:18.289> and

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
result in like a 5,000 foot drop and

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.430 
result in like a 5,000 foot drop and
that<00:04:18.680> is<00:04:18.829> of<00:04:18.979> course<00:04:19.220> obvious<00:04:19.760> death<00:04:20.539> Strider
