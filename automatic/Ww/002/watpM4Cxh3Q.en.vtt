so<00:01:58.710> there<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.520> is<00:01:59.549> let's<00:02:00.030> get<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.210> closer

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
so there it is let's get a closer

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.410 
so there it is let's get a closer
detailed<00:02:00.930> look<00:02:01.080> at<00:02:01.229> it

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
detailed look at it

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.820 
detailed look at it
so<00:02:03.420> one<00:02:03.540> opening<00:02:03.780> opening<00:02:04.229> this<00:02:04.380> up<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.680> is

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
so one opening opening this up this is

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.950 
so one opening opening this up this is
all<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.130> pretty<00:02:05.310> much<00:02:05.490> get<00:02:05.729> this<00:02:05.970> is<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.390> the

all you pretty much get this is the the
whole<00:02:07.200> thing<00:02:07.500> here<00:02:07.920> now<00:02:08.459> it's<00:02:08.729> like<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:08.879> soft

whole thing here now it's like a soft
plastic<00:02:09.869> or<00:02:10.439> well<00:02:11.310> guess<00:02:11.459> rubber<00:02:11.790> material

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
plastic or well guess rubber material

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.550 
plastic or well guess rubber material
you<00:02:12.450> can<00:02:12.599> kind<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:12.840> squeeze<00:02:13.080> it<00:02:13.200> in<00:02:13.439> it's

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
you can kind of squeeze it in it's

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.949 
you can kind of squeeze it in it's
hollow<00:02:13.799> inside<00:02:14.060> it<00:02:15.060> does<00:02:15.180> have<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.420> little<00:02:15.689> like

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
hollow inside it does have a little like

on<00:02:42.239> here<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.860> furnace<00:02:44.370> itself<00:02:44.730> does<00:02:44.970> look

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
on here the the furnace itself does look

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.820 
on here the the furnace itself does look
a<00:02:45.269> little<00:02:45.480> rusty<00:02:45.930> so<00:02:46.080> that's<00:02:46.230> pretty<00:02:46.440> cool<00:02:46.680> the

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
the all this little detail texturing is

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.539 
the all this little detail texturing is
very<00:02:51.989> nice<00:02:52.230> it's<00:02:52.500> got<00:02:52.620> bolts<00:02:53.099> right<00:02:53.280> there

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
very nice it's got bolts right there

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.729 
very nice it's got bolts right there
when<00:02:54.420> you<00:02:54.510> look<00:02:54.659> at<00:02:54.810> it<00:02:54.930> it<00:02:55.019> does<00:02:55.230> kind<00:02:55.470> of<00:02:55.530> look

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
when you look at it it does kind of look

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.259 
when you look at it it does kind of look
like<00:02:56.010> it's<00:02:56.159> almost<00:02:56.310> metal<00:02:56.849> but<00:02:56.970> it's<00:02:57.090> not

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
like it's almost metal but it's not

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:58.940 
like it's almost metal but it's not
again<00:02:57.569> it's<00:02:57.690> like<00:02:57.750> a<00:02:57.840> soft<00:02:58.079> material<00:02:58.470> almost

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.940 
again it's like a soft material almost
right<00:02:59.849> here<00:03:00.060> is<00:03:00.180> a<00:03:00.209> piping<00:03:00.810> you<00:03:01.409> can<00:03:01.560> see<00:03:01.739> that

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
right here is a piping you can see that

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.460 
right here is a piping you can see that
there<00:03:02.190> again<00:03:02.879> it's<00:03:03.060> got<00:03:03.239> a<00:03:03.269> lot<00:03:03.690> of<00:03:03.720> nice<00:03:04.110> great

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
there again it's got a lot of nice great

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.080 
there again it's got a lot of nice great
detail<00:03:04.890> to<00:03:05.040> paint<00:03:05.310> I<00:03:05.459> mean<00:03:05.610> just<00:03:05.760> look<00:03:05.909> at<00:03:05.970> the

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
detail to paint I mean just look at the

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.649 
detail to paint I mean just look at the
rusting<00:03:06.510> they<00:03:06.599> did<00:03:06.720> a<00:03:06.780> great<00:03:07.110> job<00:03:07.140> and<00:03:07.909> the<00:03:08.909> the

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
rusting they did a great job and the the

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.130 
rusting they did a great job and the the
pipe<00:03:09.870> looking<00:03:10.260> like<00:03:10.379> it's<00:03:10.560> um<00:03:11.480> all<00:03:12.480> rusted<00:03:12.959> up

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
pipe looking like it's um all rusted up

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.099 
pipe looking like it's um all rusted up
so<00:03:13.920> that's<00:03:14.040> a<00:03:14.310> side<00:03:14.760> view<00:03:14.790> of<00:03:15.180> that<00:03:15.420> it's<00:03:15.750> more

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
so that's a side view of that it's more

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:18.530 
so that's a side view of that it's more
looks<00:03:16.440> look<00:03:17.040> at<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:17.280> pipes<00:03:17.760> I<00:03:17.910> believe<00:03:18.329> that

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
looks look at the pipes I believe that

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.539 
looks look at the pipes I believe that
there's<00:03:18.750> like<00:03:18.930> a<00:03:18.959> little<00:03:19.230> rag<00:03:19.500> that's<00:03:20.310> hanging

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
there's like a little rag that's hanging

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.390 
there's like a little rag that's hanging
off<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.879> pipe<00:03:21.120> there<00:03:21.769> here's<00:03:22.769> the<00:03:22.890> bottom<00:03:23.250> of

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
off the pipe there here's the bottom of

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.399 
off the pipe there here's the bottom of
it<00:03:23.519> there's<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:23.940> there's<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.720> switch<00:03:25.049> the<00:03:25.290> on

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:25.409 
it there's the there's the switch the on

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:28.729 
it there's the there's the switch the on
and<00:03:25.560> off<00:03:25.650> switch<00:03:25.890> there<00:03:27.440> so<00:03:28.440> that's<00:03:28.620> the

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
and off switch there so that's the

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.349 
and off switch there so that's the
bottom<00:03:29.099> in<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.280> back<00:03:29.489> here<00:03:29.819> is<00:03:29.940> just<00:03:30.180> some

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
bottom in the back here is just some

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.630 
bottom in the back here is just some
more<00:03:30.599> it's<00:03:31.440> just<00:03:31.500> pretty<00:03:31.769> much<00:03:31.829> plain<00:03:32.280> but

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
more it's just pretty much plain but

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.729 
more it's just pretty much plain but
again<00:03:32.909> the<00:03:33.060> paint<00:03:33.299> the<00:03:33.629> paint<00:03:33.870> on<00:03:34.049> this<00:03:34.200> is<00:03:34.470> um

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
again the paint the paint on this is um

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:35.990 
again the paint the paint on this is um
well<00:03:35.459> done

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
well done

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.119 
well done
there's<00:03:36.209> a<00:03:36.269> top<00:03:36.510> look<00:03:36.780> at<00:03:36.870> that<00:03:37.079> we<00:03:37.890> look<00:03:38.040> at
