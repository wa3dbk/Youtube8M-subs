using<00:00:32.669> this<00:00:32.969> setup<00:00:33.510> but<00:00:33.989> this<00:00:34.260> was<00:00:34.620> one<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.040> my

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
using this setup but this was one of my

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.709 
using this setup but this was one of my
better<00:00:35.640> games<00:00:37.730> so<00:00:38.730> I<00:00:38.760> really<00:00:39.059> had<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.239> post<00:00:39.480> it

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
better games so I really had to post it

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.110 
better games so I really had to post it
and<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:40.469> also<00:00:40.860> haven't<00:00:41.280> posted<00:00:41.700> anything<00:00:41.910> a

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
and I also haven't posted anything a

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.660 
and I also haven't posted anything a
long<00:00:42.270> time<00:00:42.510> so<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.719> figure<00:00:43.309> might<00:00:44.309> as<00:00:44.340> well<00:00:44.550> be

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
long time so I figure might as well be

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.319 
long time so I figure might as well be
this<00:00:44.820> this<00:00:45.239> round<00:00:46.129> this<00:00:47.129> was<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.430> very<00:00:47.610> fast

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
this this round this was a very fast

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.380 
this this round this was a very fast
paced<00:00:48.629> game<00:00:48.750> with<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.170> lot<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.590> kills<00:00:50.210> so<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.360> is

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
paced game with a lot of kills so it is

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.990 
paced game with a lot of kills so it is
really<00:00:51.930> condensed<00:00:52.620> i<00:00:52.710> mean<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.430> original

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
really condensed i mean the the original

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.790 
really condensed i mean the the original
round<00:00:54.270> because<00:00:54.629> i<00:00:54.750> joined<00:00:55.050> late<00:00:55.289> was<00:00:55.559> only

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
round because i joined late was only

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.779 
round because i joined late was only
something<00:00:56.010> like<00:00:58.100> 13<00:00:59.100> minutes<00:00:59.460> or<00:00:59.640> something

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
something like 13 minutes or something

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.000 
something like 13 minutes or something
like<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.300> begin<00:01:00.390> with<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.960> plus<00:01:01.710> i<00:01:01.829> got<00:01:01.980> a

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
like that to begin with and plus i got a

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.700 
like that to begin with and plus i got a
whole<00:01:02.250> bunch<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.789> kills<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:04.320> video<00:01:04.650> is

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710

whole bunch of kills so this video is
mostly<00:01:04.979> going<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.369> be<00:01:06.799> looking<00:01:07.799> at<00:01:07.950> all<00:01:08.220> the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
mostly going to be looking at all the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.130 
mostly going to be looking at all the
bones<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.299> go<00:01:09.479> through<00:01:09.689> each<00:01:09.750> one<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.020> the

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
bones to go through each one of the

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.690 
bones to go through each one of the
kills<00:01:10.380> so<00:01:10.650> hopefully<00:01:11.040> hopefully<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.549> guys

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
kills so hopefully hopefully you guys

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.810 
kills so hopefully hopefully you guys
can<00:01:12.360> follow<00:01:12.990> what's<00:01:13.320> going<00:01:13.619> on<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:14.040> kind<00:01:14.700> of

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
can follow what's going on I kind of

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.600 
can follow what's going on I kind of
like<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.180> play<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.020> do<00:01:16.140> here<00:01:16.799> so<00:01:17.159> have<00:01:17.580> a

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
like the play that I do here so have a

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.510 
like the play that I do here so have a
look<00:01:17.700> at<00:01:17.850> what<00:01:17.970> happens<00:01:18.770> one<00:01:19.770> attacker<00:01:20.100> drops

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
look at what happens one attacker drops

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.030 
look at what happens one attacker drops
down<00:01:20.869> because<00:01:21.869> they<00:01:22.020> just<00:01:22.200> actually<00:01:22.530> took

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
down because they just actually took

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.580 
down because they just actually took
both<00:01:23.490> RM<00:01:23.970> comms<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.810> turn<00:01:25.020> around<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.320> see

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
very careful with my ammo because if I

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.260

earn a spin this round but I guess I

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:36.390 
earn a spin this round but I guess I
