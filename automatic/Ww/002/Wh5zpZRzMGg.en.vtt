seeing them the way we usually build
ships<00:00:30.270> is<00:00:30.510> building<00:00:31.230> them<00:00:31.380> in<00:00:31.500> blocks<00:00:31.740> we

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
ships is building them in blocks we

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.310 
ships is building them in blocks we
build<00:00:32.550> blocks<00:00:32.820> on<00:00:33.120> sides<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.780> when<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.140> block

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
build blocks on sides and when the block

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.020 
build blocks on sides and when the block
is<00:00:34.350> pretty<00:00:34.770> much<00:00:34.920> finished<00:00:35.220> we<00:00:35.550> lift<00:00:35.910> the

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
is pretty much finished we lift the

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.820 
is pretty much finished we lift the
block<00:00:36.180> into<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.600> dock<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:36.960> then<00:00:37.440> put<00:00:37.739> them

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:37.830 
block into the dock and then put them

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.799 
block into the dock and then put them
together<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.370> build<00:00:38.970> the<00:00:39.120> ship<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.480> sip<00:00:39.780> of

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
together and build the ship a sip of

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.320 
together and build the ship a sip of
this<00:00:40.020> size<00:00:40.320> has<00:00:40.739> approximately<00:00:41.340> 80<00:00:41.520> blocks<00:00:41.880> so

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.330 
this size has approximately 80 blocks so

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.420 
this size has approximately 80 blocks so
to<00:00:42.390> putting<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:42.840> all<00:00:42.989> together<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.590> it's<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.250> big

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
to putting it all together is it's a big

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.890 
to putting it all together is it's a big
opportunities<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.970> big<00:00:45.120> challenge<00:00:45.300> but<00:00:45.540> it<00:00:45.690> is

opportunities a big challenge but it is
very<00:00:45.930> exciting<00:00:46.739> because<00:00:46.940> during<00:00:47.940> approaches

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
very exciting because during approaches

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.600 
very exciting because during approaches
you<00:00:48.570> can<00:00:48.989> mold<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.559> little<00:00:49.739> bit<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.280> make

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
you can mold it a little bit and make

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.670 
you can mold it a little bit and make
some<00:00:50.790> changes<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.390> be<00:00:51.660> sure<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.500> the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
some changes to be sure that it is the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.610
