00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
hi this is Andrew Klein today's video is

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.170 
hi this is Andrew Klein today's video is
going<00:00:04.920> to<00:00:04.980> take<00:00:05.130> a<00:00:05.190> look<00:00:05.370> at<00:00:05.430> a<00:00:05.460> new<00:00:05.609> feature<00:00:05.640> in

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
going to take a look at a new feature in

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.000 
going to take a look at a new feature in
ZBrush<00:00:06.779> for<00:00:07.470> our<00:00:07.799> two<00:00:08.660> that<00:00:09.660> I<00:00:10.139> just<00:00:10.590> think<00:00:10.830> is

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
ZBrush for our two that I just think is

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.650 
ZBrush for our two that I just think is
incredibly<00:00:11.700> awesome<00:00:11.910> and<00:00:12.300> hopefully<00:00:12.540> you<00:00:12.630> can

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
incredibly awesome and hopefully you can

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.680 
incredibly awesome and hopefully you can
find<00:00:12.929> some<00:00:13.170> use<00:00:13.320> for<00:00:13.670> what<00:00:14.670> I<00:00:14.700> have<00:00:14.880> here<00:00:15.089> is<00:00:15.299> a

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
find some use for what I have here is a

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.439 
find some use for what I have here is a
t-shirt<00:00:16.170> model<00:00:17.630> the<00:00:18.630> base<00:00:19.140> model<00:00:20.240> down<00:00:21.240> at

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
t-shirt model the base model down at

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.460 
t-shirt model the base model down at
level<00:00:21.689> one<00:00:21.900> looks<00:00:22.320> like<00:00:22.500> this<00:00:23.930> the<00:00:24.930> sculpt

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
level one looks like this the sculpt

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.170 
level one looks like this the sculpt
that<00:00:25.619> I've<00:00:25.680> applied<00:00:25.800> so<00:00:26.160> far<00:00:26.400> kind<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:26.849> giving

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
that I've applied so far kind of giving

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.540 
that I've applied so far kind of giving
a<00:00:27.720> secondary<00:00:28.380> detail<00:00:28.769> has<00:00:29.039> just<00:00:29.310> sort<00:00:29.490> of

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
a secondary detail has just sort of

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.089 
a secondary detail has just sort of
created<00:00:30.170> fabric<00:00:31.170> wrinkles<00:00:31.529> along<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.920> bottom

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
created fabric wrinkles along the bottom

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.549 
created fabric wrinkles along the bottom
and<00:00:32.489> what<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.059> want<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.360> do<00:00:33.540> with<00:00:33.809> today's<00:00:34.110> demo

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
and what I want to do with today's demo

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.500 
and what I want to do with today's demo
is<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:34.829> want<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.309> try<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.760> describe<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.300> type

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
is I want to try and describe the type

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.389 
is I want to try and describe the type
of<00:00:36.719> fabric<00:00:37.140> that's<00:00:37.320> on<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.620> surface<00:00:37.800> using<00:00:38.219> a

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
of fabric that's on the surface using a

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.850 
of fabric that's on the surface using a
new<00:00:38.520> noise<00:00:38.730> feature<00:00:39.120> that<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.690> now<00:00:40.350> available

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
new noise feature that is now available

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.360 
new noise feature that is now available
in<00:00:40.920> 4.2<00:00:42.020> so<00:00:43.020> one<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.010> things<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.309> I

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
in 4.2 so one of the things that I

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.920 
in 4.2 so one of the things that I
should<00:00:44.520> mention<00:00:44.670> about<00:00:44.850> this<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.600> this

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
should mention about this is that this

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.420 
should mention about this is that this
object<00:00:46.800> has<00:00:47.219> already<00:00:47.430> been<00:00:47.550> u<00:00:47.760> vide<00:00:48.149> if<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.430> make

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
object has already been u vide if I make

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.170 
object has already been u vide if I make
a<00:00:50.670> new<00:00:51.000> texture<00:00:51.449> from<00:00:52.020> UV<00:00:52.620> check<00:00:52.920> here<00:00:53.280> you'll

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
a new texture from UV check here you'll

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.330 
a new texture from UV check here you'll
be<00:00:54.329> able<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.660> see<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.739> UV<00:00:56.340> unwrap<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.969> this

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
be able to see the UV unwrap of this

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.569 
be able to see the UV unwrap of this
unwrapped<00:00:59.340> pretty<00:00:59.609> standard<00:01:00.030> ly<00:01:00.149> there<00:01:00.960> is

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
unwrapped pretty standard ly there is

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:03.920 
unwrapped pretty standard ly there is
pretty<00:01:02.579> much<00:01:02.789> one<00:01:03.000> continuous<00:01:03.480> shell<00:01:03.690> with

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
pretty much one continuous shell with

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.750 
pretty much one continuous shell with
separate<00:01:04.199> cell<00:01:04.379> shells<00:01:04.890> for<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.159> sleeves<00:01:05.430> and

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
separate cell shells for the sleeves and

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.210 
separate cell shells for the sleeves and
a<00:01:06.180> very<00:01:06.330> minimal<00:01:06.720> amount<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.990> distortion<00:01:07.290> to

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
a very minimal amount of distortion to

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.410 
a very minimal amount of distortion to
do<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.460> technique<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:08.790> we're<00:01:09.000> about<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.180> do

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
do the technique that we're about to do

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.570 
do the technique that we're about to do
this<00:01:09.659> works<00:01:09.930> best<00:01:10.380> if<00:01:10.680> your<00:01:10.920> object<00:01:11.430> has

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
this works best if your object has

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.660 
this works best if your object has
already<00:01:11.970> been<00:01:12.119> UV<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:13.250> that's<00:01:14.250> what<00:01:14.430> we<00:01:14.520> have

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
already been UV so that's what we have

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.260 
already been UV so that's what we have
here<00:01:14.880> first<00:01:15.740> what<00:01:16.740> I'm<00:01:16.799> going<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.979> do<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.340> in<00:01:18.210> my

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
here first what I'm going to do is in my

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.749 
here first what I'm going to do is in my
tool<00:01:18.720> palette<00:01:19.170> about<00:01:19.920> halfway<00:01:20.130> down<00:01:20.430> I'm

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
tool palette about halfway down I'm

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.330 
tool palette about halfway down I'm
going<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.060> open<00:01:21.270> up<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.840> surface<00:01:22.290> rollout<00:01:23.130> and

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
going to open up the surface rollout and

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.920 
going to open up the surface rollout and
it<00:01:23.700> used<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:24.000> be<00:01:24.090> here<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.509> we<00:01:24.600> just<00:01:24.750> had

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
it used to be here that we just had

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.929 
it used to be here that we just had
noise<00:01:25.200> attributes<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.400> create<00:01:26.640> things<00:01:26.820> like

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
noise attributes to create things like

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.149 
noise attributes to create things like
rust<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.689> rocks<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.290> surface<00:01:28.590> details<00:01:28.950> like

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
rust and rocks and surface details like

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.950 
rust and rocks and surface details like
that<00:01:29.189> but<00:01:30.060> they've<00:01:30.210> really<00:01:30.420> beefed<00:01:30.630> up<00:01:30.780> the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
that but they've really beefed up the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.450 
that but they've really beefed up the
noise<00:01:31.079> attributes<00:01:31.650> in<00:01:31.890> ZBrush<00:01:32.340> for<00:01:32.670> our<00:01:32.909> -<00:01:33.229> to

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
noise attributes in ZBrush for our - to

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.160 
noise attributes in ZBrush for our - to
edit<00:01:35.460> this<00:01:35.700> I'm<00:01:36.329> now<00:01:36.509> just<00:01:36.659> going<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.900> turn<00:01:36.990> on

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
edit this I'm now just going to turn on

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.690 
edit this I'm now just going to turn on
noise<00:01:37.439> which<00:01:37.829> is<00:01:37.860> very<00:01:38.159> similar<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.490> what<00:01:38.610> we

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
noise which is very similar to what we

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.700 
noise which is very similar to what we
had<00:01:38.820> before<00:01:39.020> except<00:01:40.020> now<00:01:40.140> when<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.409> turn<00:01:40.470> on

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
had before except now when I turn on

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.740 
had before except now when I turn on
noise<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.280> get<00:01:41.460> this<00:01:41.610> whole<00:01:41.820> menu<00:01:42.090> which<00:01:42.450> pops

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
noise I get this whole menu which pops

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.300 
noise I get this whole menu which pops
up<00:01:42.990> which<00:01:43.229> has<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.380> lot<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:43.649> interactive

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
up which has a lot of interactive

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.920 
up which has a lot of interactive
options<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:44.970> here<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.420> can<00:01:45.570> even<00:01:45.630> see<00:01:45.899> a

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
options and here you can even see a

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.700 
options and here you can even see a
preview<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:47.340> shirt<00:01:47.579> as<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:48.149> go<00:01:48.680> well<00:01:49.680> a

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
preview of this shirt as I go well a

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.200 
preview of this shirt as I go well a
couple<00:01:50.130> things<00:01:50.189> about<00:01:50.340> this<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.909> know<00:01:51.000> if<00:01:51.090> I

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
couple things about this you know if I

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.760 
couple things about this you know if I
turn<00:01:51.450> up<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.860> strength<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:53.189> my<00:01:53.399> noise<00:01:54.500> and<00:01:55.500> the

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
turn up the strength of my noise and the

elements<00:02:02.009> are<00:02:02.159> pretty<00:02:02.640> much<00:02:02.880> similar<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.780> what

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
elements are pretty much similar to what

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.319 
elements are pretty much similar to what
we<00:02:04.680> had<00:02:04.799> experienced<00:02:05.399> in<00:02:05.490> previous<00:02:05.700> versions

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.940 

so<00:02:12.580> let<00:02:13.300> me<00:02:13.360> just<00:02:13.510> reset<00:02:13.990> these<00:02:14.230> values<00:02:14.740> out

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
so let me just reset these values out

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.400 
so let me just reset these values out
here<00:02:18.270> what<00:02:19.270> I'm<00:02:19.360> going<00:02:19.510> to<00:02:19.540> do<00:02:19.690> now<00:02:19.930> though<00:02:20.200> is

you're not going to see anything happen
here<00:03:15.790> this<00:03:16.720> is<00:03:16.840> partially<00:03:17.230> because<00:03:17.320> the<00:03:17.590> scale

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
here this is partially because the scale

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.460 
here this is partially because the scale
and<00:03:18.100> the<00:03:18.190> strength<00:03:18.490> haven't<00:03:18.820> been<00:03:18.910> set<00:03:19.150> yet

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.470 
and the strength haven't been set yet
now<00:03:20.470> I'm<00:03:20.710> going<00:03:21.130> to<00:03:21.310> adjust<00:03:21.610> the<00:03:22.060> strength

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
now I'm going to adjust the strength

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.150 
now I'm going to adjust the strength
value<00:03:22.960> to<00:03:23.170> a<00:03:23.200> point<00:03:23.470> at<00:03:23.530> which<00:03:23.620> you<00:03:23.770> can<00:03:23.920> see

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
value to a point at which you can see

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.790 
value to a point at which you can see
this<00:03:24.370> and<00:03:24.810> all<00:03:25.810> of<00:03:25.960> a<00:03:26.020> sudden<00:03:26.290> you'll<00:03:26.380> see<00:03:26.620> that

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
this and all of a sudden you'll see that

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.960 
this and all of a sudden you'll see that
fabric<00:03:27.430> pattern<00:03:27.820> apply<00:03:28.240> to<00:03:28.750> the<00:03:29.290> shirt<00:03:29.850> so<00:03:30.850> one

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
fabric pattern apply to the shirt so one

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.130 
fabric pattern apply to the shirt so one
of<00:03:31.060> the<00:03:31.120> problems<00:03:31.450> of<00:03:31.510> this<00:03:31.660> though<00:03:31.900> is<00:03:31.960> you're

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
of the problems of this though is you're

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.030 
of the problems of this though is you're
going<00:03:32.230> to<00:03:32.320> notice<00:03:32.410> that<00:03:32.590> there<00:03:32.740> is<00:03:32.770> some

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
going to notice that there is some

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.250 
going to notice that there is some
streaking<00:03:33.820> here<00:03:34.030> maybe<00:03:34.270> along<00:03:34.570> the<00:03:34.630> side<00:03:34.960> if

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
streaking here maybe along the side if

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.490 
streaking here maybe along the side if
you<00:03:35.320> can<00:03:35.440> see<00:03:35.620> that<00:03:35.850> if<00:03:36.850> I<00:03:37.030> apply<00:03:37.420> this<00:03:37.480> on<00:03:38.080> and

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
you can see that if I apply this on and

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.900 
you can see that if I apply this on and
let<00:03:38.590> me<00:03:38.650> just<00:03:38.680> say<00:03:38.950> okay<00:03:39.250> so<00:03:39.310> you<00:03:39.550> can<00:03:39.640> see<00:03:39.700> if<00:03:39.820> I

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
let me just say okay so you can see if I

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.630 
let me just say okay so you can see if I
can<00:03:40.060> edit<00:03:40.210> in<00:03:40.420> a<00:03:40.450> second<00:03:40.870> if<00:03:41.740> I<00:03:41.830> say<00:03:42.040> okay<00:03:42.340> here

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
can edit in a second if I say okay here

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.220 
can edit in a second if I say okay here

menu and this streakiness is caused by

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:57.840 
menu and this streakiness is caused by
the<00:03:56.470> fact<00:03:56.680> that<00:03:56.740> this<00:03:56.890> is<00:03:57.040> being<00:03:57.190> generated<00:03:57.430> by

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
the fact that this is being generated by

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.780 
the fact that this is being generated by
the<00:03:57.910> 3d<00:03:58.660> preview<00:03:58.900> mode<00:03:59.170> I'm<00:04:00.070> instead<00:04:00.490> going<00:04:00.550> to

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
the 3d preview mode I'm instead going to

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.390 
the 3d preview mode I'm instead going to
switch<00:04:01.060> to<00:04:01.090> the<00:04:01.420> UV<00:04:01.810> preview<00:04:02.380> mode<00:04:02.590> so<00:04:03.280> it's

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
switch to the UV preview mode so it's

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.950 
switch to the UV preview mode so it's
not<00:04:03.550> projecting<00:04:04.060> it<00:04:04.180> in<00:04:04.240> 3d<00:04:04.450> it's<00:04:04.720> really

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:04.960 
not projecting it in 3d it's really

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.450 
not projecting it in 3d it's really
projecting<00:04:05.380> it<00:04:05.500> through<00:04:05.770> the<00:04:05.920> UVs

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:06.460 
projecting it through the UVs

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:07.770 
projecting it through the UVs
and<00:04:07.090> now<00:04:07.210> I'm<00:04:07.270> gonna<00:04:07.360> have<00:04:07.480> something<00:04:07.690> that

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
and now I'm gonna have something that

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.170 
and now I'm gonna have something that
matches<00:04:08.050> up<00:04:08.770> and<00:04:09.160> has<00:04:09.370> less<00:04:09.640> distortion

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
matches up and has less distortion

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.550 
matches up and has less distortion
because<00:04:10.390> my<00:04:10.510> u<00:04:10.570> these<00:04:10.840> are<00:04:11.020> on<00:04:11.140> flattened

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
because my u these are on flattened

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.760 
because my u these are on flattened
really<00:04:11.740> nicely<00:04:11.920> I<00:04:12.450> do<00:04:13.450> have<00:04:13.960> to<00:04:14.200> however

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
really nicely I do have to however

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.460 
really nicely I do have to however
change<00:04:15.220> the<00:04:15.490> scale<00:04:15.940> of<00:04:16.270> this<00:04:16.630> because<00:04:17.350> you'll

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
change the scale of this because you'll

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.260 
change the scale of this because you'll
notice<00:04:17.620> that<00:04:17.799> my<00:04:17.950> scale<00:04:18.250> is<00:04:18.460> way<00:04:18.640> too<00:04:18.700> big<00:04:19.030> I'm

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:19.270 
notice that my scale is way too big I'm

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:21.630 
notice that my scale is way too big I'm
going<00:04:19.390> to<00:04:19.450> turn<00:04:19.570> the<00:04:19.780> scale<00:04:20.020> down<00:04:20.489> and<00:04:21.489> also

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
going to turn the scale down and also

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.730 
going to turn the scale down and also
just<00:04:21.940> adjust<00:04:22.419> the<00:04:22.570> strength<00:04:22.870> up<00:04:23.169> a<00:04:23.230> little<00:04:23.560> bit

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
just adjust the strength up a little bit

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.860 
just adjust the strength up a little bit
here<00:04:24.040> and

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
here and

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.240 
here and
I still<00:04:26.260> have<00:04:26.380> access<00:04:26.530> to<00:04:26.860> any<00:04:27.010> of<00:04:27.160> the

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
I still have access to any of the

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.740 
I still have access to any of the
sliders<00:04:27.669> that<00:04:27.699> I<00:04:27.880> could<00:04:28.060> have<00:04:28.150> used<00:04:28.300> before

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
sliders that I could have used before

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.439 
sliders that I could have used before
such<00:04:29.530> as<00:04:29.680> my<00:04:29.800> scaling<00:04:30.190> values<00:04:30.790> if<00:04:31.090> you<00:04:31.120> want<00:04:31.389> to

such as my scaling values if you want to

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:34.320 
such as my scaling values if you want to

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
like flatten this off a bit using focal

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.330 
like flatten this off a bit using focal

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
shift and offset I'm just going to say

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.810 
shift and offset I'm just going to say
okay<00:04:36.699> and<00:04:37.710> moments<00:04:38.710> later<00:04:38.770> I<00:04:39.280> have<00:04:39.430> a<00:04:39.460> pretty

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
okay and moments later I have a pretty

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.100 
okay and moments later I have a pretty
nice<00:04:40.590> seamless<00:04:41.590> application<00:04:42.280> of<00:04:43.240> this<00:04:43.840> fabric

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
nice seamless application of this fabric

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.230 
nice seamless application of this fabric

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
level detail but this actually gets one

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.860 
level detail but this actually gets one
step<00:04:50.800> cooler<00:04:51.100> because<00:04:51.820> you<00:04:52.180> can<00:04:52.330> also<00:04:52.479> use

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870

that's this feature here called color
blend<00:04:57.270> let's<00:04:58.270> say<00:04:58.479> I<00:04:58.510> want<00:04:58.930> my<00:04:59.080> shirt<00:04:59.410> to<00:04:59.680> be

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
blend let's say I want my shirt to be

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.560 
blend let's say I want my shirt to be
blue<00:05:00.400> I<00:05:00.789> can<00:05:01.300> turn<00:05:01.600> on<00:05:01.630> color<00:05:02.169> blend<00:05:02.560> and

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
blue I can turn on color blend and

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.120 
blue I can turn on color blend and
setting<00:05:04.570> my<00:05:04.720> color<00:05:05.020> and<00:05:05.289> then<00:05:05.680> setting<00:05:06.039> the

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
setting my color and then setting the

amount<00:05:06.520> of<00:05:06.789> color<00:05:07.419> blend<00:05:07.840> I<00:05:08.229> could<00:05:09.100> determine

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
amount of color blend I could determine

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.990 
amount of color blend I could determine
how<00:05:10.020> much<00:05:11.020> blue<00:05:11.440> actually<00:05:11.949> gets<00:05:12.130> applied<00:05:12.520> to

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
how much blue actually gets applied to

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.120 
how much blue actually gets applied to
this<00:05:13.210> based<00:05:13.690> on<00:05:13.870> the<00:05:14.020> height<00:05:14.229> of<00:05:14.440> that<00:05:14.680> alpha

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
this based on the height of that alpha

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.170 
this based on the height of that alpha
so<00:05:15.940> if<00:05:16.090> I<00:05:16.180> paint<00:05:16.419> bucketed<00:05:16.990> a<00:05:17.910> you<00:05:18.910> know<00:05:19.000> pretty

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
so if I paint bucketed a you know pretty

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:25.650 
so if I paint bucketed a you know pretty
dark<00:05:19.630> blue<00:05:20.020> on<00:05:20.320> to<00:05:20.680> my<00:05:20.800> model<00:05:21.220> first<00:05:24.630> going<00:05:25.630> to

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
dark blue on to my model first going to

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.250 
dark blue on to my model first going to
color<00:05:26.590> and<00:05:26.979> saying<00:05:27.789> fill<00:05:28.150> object<00:05:28.810> with<00:05:29.020> that

color and saying fill object with that

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.940 
color and saying fill object with that
blue<00:05:29.590> I<00:05:30.510> can<00:05:31.510> then<00:05:31.690> probably<00:05:32.200> come<00:05:32.650> in<00:05:32.770> and

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:32.950 
blue I can then probably come in and

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.370 
blue I can then probably come in and
drop<00:05:33.220> this<00:05:33.460> color<00:05:33.789> right<00:05:34.060> on<00:05:34.180> top<00:05:34.389> of<00:05:34.419> it<00:05:34.660> blend

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
drop this color right on top of it blend

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.129 
drop this color right on top of it blend
the<00:05:35.560> two<00:05:35.740> right<00:05:35.979> together<00:05:36.190> and<00:05:36.639> I<00:05:37.419> have<00:05:37.990> the

ability to kind of shift to the highs

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.540 
ability to kind of shift to the highs
and<00:05:40.180> the<00:05:40.599> lows<00:05:41.020> depending<00:05:41.680> on<00:05:41.800> which<00:05:42.010> side<00:05:42.340> of

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
of that blending as well and you're

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.089 
of that blending as well and you're
going<00:05:55.599> to<00:05:55.720> see<00:05:55.870> I<00:05:55.900> can<00:05:56.139> get<00:05:56.289> a<00:05:56.590> pretty<00:05:56.919> much

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:57.099 
going to see I can get a pretty much

off<00:06:00.550> color<00:06:00.789> blend<00:06:01.090> oh<00:06:01.270> just<00:06:01.510> take<00:06:01.720> a<00:06:01.750> look<00:06:01.900> at

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
off color blend oh just take a look at

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:07.200 
off color blend oh just take a look at
this<00:06:02.139> and<00:06:04.560> go<00:06:05.560> back<00:06:05.590> refill<00:06:06.310> my<00:06:06.490> object<00:06:07.030> with

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 
this and go back refill my object with

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:12.270 
this and go back refill my object with
white<00:06:09.810> there<00:06:10.810> we<00:06:10.990> go<00:06:11.139> now<00:06:11.889> again<00:06:12.099> this<00:06:12.220> is

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:12.280 
white there we go now again this is

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.189 
white there we go now again this is
still<00:06:12.610> not<00:06:12.729> completely<00:06:13.240> applied<00:06:13.630> to<00:06:13.870> the<00:06:13.990> mesh

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:14.199 
still not completely applied to the mesh

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:17.610 
still not completely applied to the mesh
yet<00:06:14.470> to<00:06:14.949> do<00:06:15.610> this<00:06:15.789> I<00:06:16.150> have<00:06:16.960> to<00:06:17.110> actually<00:06:17.199> bake

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:17.620 
yet to do this I have to actually bake

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.810 
yet to do this I have to actually bake
this<00:06:17.860> in<00:06:18.130> using<00:06:18.820> noise<00:06:19.349> apply<00:06:20.349> to<00:06:20.410> mesh<00:06:20.889> so

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:21.820 
this in using noise apply to mesh so

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.490 
this in using noise apply to mesh so
once<00:06:22.090> I've<00:06:22.270> got<00:06:22.510> my<00:06:22.539> scale<00:06:23.199> and<00:06:23.440> everything

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:23.500 
once I've got my scale and everything

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.070 
once I've got my scale and everything
the<00:06:23.949> way<00:06:24.099> I<00:06:24.130> would<00:06:24.370> like<00:06:24.520> it<00:06:24.810> and<00:06:25.810> I<00:06:25.930> have

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 
the way I would like it and I have

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.750 
the way I would like it and I have
enough<00:06:26.410> geometry<00:06:26.919> to<00:06:27.010> support<00:06:27.340> this<00:06:27.460> I<00:06:27.669> have

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:27.760 
enough geometry to support this I have

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.270 
enough geometry to support this I have
two<00:06:27.970> million<00:06:28.300> polygons<00:06:28.780> right<00:06:29.050> now<00:06:29.169> I<00:06:29.410> can

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:30.280 
two million polygons right now I can

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.820 
two million polygons right now I can
just<00:06:30.310> say<00:06:30.699> surface<00:06:31.360> applied<00:06:31.960> to<00:06:32.199> mesh<00:06:32.440> and

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830 
just say surface applied to mesh and

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.890 
just say surface applied to mesh and
this<00:06:33.669> will<00:06:33.880> actually<00:06:34.240> bake<00:06:34.450> it<00:06:34.599> into<00:06:34.810> the

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:34.900 
this will actually bake it into the

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.550 
this will actually bake it into the
polygon<00:06:35.320> structure<00:06:35.740> as<00:06:35.890> we<00:06:36.640> see<00:06:37.030> here<00:06:37.560> so

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 
polygon structure as we see here so

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.050 
polygon structure as we see here so
that's<00:06:38.710> it<00:06:38.919> hope<00:06:39.159> you<00:06:39.310> enjoyed<00:06:39.340> this

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.060 
that's it hope you enjoyed this

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.150 
that's it hope you enjoyed this
