designed to provide extra strength to

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.190 
designed to provide extra strength to
the<00:01:13.280> unit<00:01:13.549> in<00:01:13.670> wind<00:01:13.909> and<00:01:14.060> also<00:01:14.840> comes<00:01:15.140> with

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
the unit in wind and also comes with

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.840 
the unit in wind and also comes with
pegs<00:01:15.500> and<00:01:15.649> ropes<00:01:15.829> if<00:01:15.979> you<00:01:16.070> do<00:01:16.219> require<00:01:16.579> them

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
pegs and ropes if you do require them

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.760

there's<00:01:17.329> also<00:01:17.509> a<00:01:17.630> vent<00:01:17.960> system<00:01:18.350> in<00:01:18.469> the<00:01:18.590> roof

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
there's also a vent system in the roof

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.170 
there's also a vent system in the roof
which<00:01:18.799> allows<00:01:19.280> the<00:01:19.430> breeze<00:01:19.610> to<00:01:19.789> move<00:01:19.939> through

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
which allows the breeze to move through

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.670 
which allows the breeze to move through
the<00:01:20.299> unit<00:01:20.539> so<00:01:20.689> as<00:01:20.780> well<00:01:20.930> as<00:01:21.049> keeping<00:01:21.320> your<00:01:21.380> cool

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
the unit so as well as keeping your cool

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.010 
the unit so as well as keeping your cool
it<00:01:22.130> also<00:01:22.369> reduces<00:01:22.850> wind<00:01:23.210> lift<00:01:23.539> from<00:01:23.810> wind

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
it also reduces wind lift from wind

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.980 
it also reduces wind lift from wind
wanting<00:01:24.289> to<00:01:24.380> get<00:01:24.469> caught<00:01:24.710> up<00:01:24.860> inside<00:01:25.490> the<00:01:25.670> unit

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
wanting to get caught up inside the unit

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.209 
wanting to get caught up inside the unit
so<00:01:26.990> we're<00:01:27.079> going<00:01:27.170> to<00:01:27.259> now<00:01:27.469> see<00:01:27.680> a<00:01:27.710> mesh<00:01:27.950> to<00:01:28.070> keep

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:28.219 
so we're going to now see a mesh to keep

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:29.859 
so we're going to now see a mesh to keep
the<00:01:28.310> bugs<00:01:28.490> out<00:01:28.670> but<00:01:29.090> if<00:01:29.180> we're<00:01:29.329> not<00:01:29.360> so<00:01:29.630> worried

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
the bugs out but if we're not so worried

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:31.450 
the bugs out but if we're not so worried
about<00:01:29.930> the<00:01:30.140> bugs<00:01:30.320> we've<00:01:30.530> also<00:01:30.710> got<00:01:30.950> two<00:01:31.130> large
