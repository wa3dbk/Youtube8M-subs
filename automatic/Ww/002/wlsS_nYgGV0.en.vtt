if we pass out we could do our final
show<00:03:02.740> which<00:03:03.040> i<00:03:03.160> think<00:03:03.220> is<00:03:03.430> really<00:03:03.820> fresh<00:03:04.060> I

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
show which i think is really fresh I

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.030 
show which i think is really fresh I
think<00:03:04.390> I<00:03:04.540> think<00:03:05.020> the<00:03:05.170> fans<00:03:05.410> are<00:03:05.590> lacking<00:03:05.740> a<00:03:05.890> lot

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
think I think the fans are lacking a lot

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.860 
think I think the fans are lacking a lot
so<00:03:06.250> hopefully<00:03:06.580> we<00:03:06.670> could<00:03:07.240> get<00:03:07.330> to<00:03:07.480> that<00:03:07.600> step

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870
