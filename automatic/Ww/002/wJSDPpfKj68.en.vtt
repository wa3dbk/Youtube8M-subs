00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.879
 how to sow distant poppies in 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.879
 a potato crate 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.780
 and for that you use a crate of 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:12.760
 potatoes about fifteen apples 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.740
 of land to the particularity since 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.689
 it's less about keeping the humidity 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.160
 during very hot times we 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:18.910
 let's fill it with potting soil 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.669
 seedling 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.100
 the particularity of sowing and cuttings 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:25.600
 it is that he is poor who is very well 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.430
 for the seeds 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.750
 if you did not have that kind of potting soil 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.580
 it would take a little longer to lengthen 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.140
 sauce by adding a little bit of sand 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.930
 or vermiculite once you have 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.449
 well extended your potting we are going to 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.190
 to pack walt enough so that 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:40.690
 seeds and shoots well and does not sink 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.690
 not too deep in the soil 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:47.620
 since the Icelandic poppy seed is 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.809
 very small and for proof here is the 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:54.339
 seed we will put it on a sheet 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:56.140
 white and we will realize that it is 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.690
 the very little ass with that there 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.260
 has plenty to sow to sow 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.320
 this terrine 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.150
 so to sow them you use a 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.010
 business card the seed is so 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.220
 small that you fold in half if you 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:13.960
 do not have to see each other once you have 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:17.170
 folded your lay your leaf on your 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.820
 sowing or on your terrine in case where 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.440
 they would fall alex rsa can happen 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:26.230
 here and we love our valves with the tip 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.450
 very very lightly 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.320
 you can even go up a little bit your 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.510
 vote receive way what the seeds 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:38.050
 bounce once we finish we 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:46.140
 new range by excelling in our 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:48.960
 package and we will pass on the seeds 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.790
 quite strongly 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.560
 a little bit of potting soil over 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.800
 very very light very light very light 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.520
 very light very light very light and we 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.520
 pass once again 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.470
 once we have packed well we water 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.679
 copiously the first time without for 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:13.590
 as much cause flooding and 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.900
 the trick to keep the freshness 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.510
 you use another box you have it 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.860
 overhead there is always a 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.230
 little bit of air that will allow you to 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.230
 monitor the lift you install yourself 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.910
 not your iceland in the shade and soon 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.710
 that they will be lifted are there you 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.480
 remove the cover you expect 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.500
 that it grows well and you will practice 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.500
 your first transplanting
