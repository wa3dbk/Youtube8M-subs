you can even work with our engineers to

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.500 
you can even work with our engineers to

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
get the backlight to work if you still

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.930 
get the backlight to work if you still
want<00:02:36.690> it<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:36.870> glow<00:02:37.020> when<00:02:37.470> it<00:02:37.560> turns<00:02:37.739> on<00:02:37.980> I<00:02:38.220> did

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
want it to glow when it turns on I did

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.880 
want it to glow when it turns on I did
and<00:02:39.180> sure<00:02:39.900> enough<00:02:39.930> when<00:02:40.470> you<00:02:40.590> turn<00:02:40.770> this

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
and sure enough when you turn this

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.250 
and sure enough when you turn this
laptop<00:02:41.069> on<00:02:41.459> it<00:02:42.000> glows<00:02:42.480> I<00:02:42.750> think<00:02:42.959> this<00:02:43.050> looks

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
laptop on it glows I think this looks

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.589 
laptop on it glows I think this looks
absolutely<00:02:43.950> ridiculously<00:02:44.760> insanely<00:02:45.209> good

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
absolutely ridiculously insanely good

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.150 
absolutely ridiculously insanely good
and<00:02:45.900> I<00:02:46.230> think<00:02:46.290> it's<00:02:46.470> safe<00:02:46.590> to<00:02:46.680> say<00:02:46.739> this<00:02:46.980> is<00:02:47.129> a

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
and I think it's safe to say this is a

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.210 
and I think it's safe to say this is a
legit<00:02:47.670> mkbhd<00:02:48.209> Edition<00:02:48.840> MacBook<00:02:49.349> after<00:02:50.099> the

same way it's still the MacBook Pro that
you<00:03:02.610> paid<00:03:03.000> for<00:03:03.030> I'm<00:03:03.959> basically<00:03:04.260> in<00:03:04.380> love<00:03:04.530> with

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
you paid for I'm basically in love with

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:05.809 
you paid for I'm basically in love with
this<00:03:04.739> now<00:03:04.920> so<00:03:05.099> the<00:03:05.220> one<00:03:05.310> thing<00:03:05.459> that<00:03:05.610> remains

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
this now so the one thing that remains

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.760 
this now so the one thing that remains
to<00:03:05.940> be<00:03:06.000> seen<00:03:06.060> is<00:03:06.480> how<00:03:06.720> durable<00:03:07.200> this<00:03:07.500> kind<00:03:07.709> of

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
to be seen is how durable this kind of

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.949 
to be seen is how durable this kind of
stuff<00:03:07.920> will<00:03:08.069> be<00:03:08.220> it's<00:03:08.910> obviously<00:03:09.390> painted<00:03:09.870> on

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
stuff will be it's obviously painted on

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.660 
stuff will be it's obviously painted on
so<00:03:10.200> it's<00:03:10.349> permanent<00:03:10.830> not<00:03:10.980> like<00:03:11.130> a<00:03:11.160> temporary

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
so it's permanent not like a temporary

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.280 
so it's permanent not like a temporary
sticker<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.540> that's<00:03:12.720> part<00:03:12.900> of<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.020> reason<00:03:13.230> I

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
sticker and that's part of the reason I

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.040 
sticker and that's part of the reason I
didn't<00:03:13.560> go<00:03:13.680> with<00:03:13.860> like<00:03:14.010> a<00:03:14.040> Ferrari<00:03:14.760> red<00:03:15.090> bright

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
didn't go with like a Ferrari red bright

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.170 
didn't go with like a Ferrari red bright
painted<00:03:16.830> laptop<00:03:17.280> because<00:03:17.670> you<00:03:18.000> know<00:03:18.090> that's

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
painted laptop because you know that's

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.670 
painted laptop because you know that's
really<00:03:18.420> cool<00:03:18.600> after<00:03:18.870> like<00:03:18.989> a<00:03:19.020> week<00:03:19.260> but<00:03:19.500> it's

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
really cool after like a week but it's

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.470 
really cool after like a week but it's

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
how bad does that look obviously the

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.330 
how bad does that look obviously the
logo<00:03:49.110> reconstruction<00:03:49.739> is<00:03:49.830> something<00:03:50.130> very

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
logo reconstruction is something very

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.430 
logo reconstruction is something very
unique<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:51.000> from<00:03:51.480> me<00:03:51.810> looking<00:03:52.140> at<00:03:52.260> the

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
unique and from me looking at the

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.289 
unique and from me looking at the
materials<00:03:53.040> that<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.280> logos<00:03:53.580> made<00:03:53.760> of<00:03:53.940> it

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
materials that the logos made of it

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:55.580 
materials that the logos made of it
looks<00:03:54.510> pretty<00:03:54.720> solid<00:03:54.930> and<00:03:55.260> it<00:03:55.350> doesn't<00:03:55.530> look

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
looks pretty solid and it doesn't look

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.020 
looks pretty solid and it doesn't look
like<00:03:55.650> it's<00:03:55.860> gonna<00:03:55.920> break<00:03:56.220> anytime<00:03:56.519> soon<00:03:56.880> or

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
like it's gonna break anytime soon or

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.900 
like it's gonna break anytime soon or
fall<00:03:57.269> apart<00:03:57.440> it's<00:03:58.440> really<00:03:58.890> precisely<00:03:59.250> cut<00:03:59.670> and

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
fall apart it's really precisely cut and

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.550 
fall apart it's really precisely cut and
it<00:04:00.000> matches<00:04:00.180> exactly<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.930> logo<00:04:01.380> that<00:04:01.530> I

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
it matches exactly the logo that I

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.960 
it matches exactly the logo that I
provided<00:04:02.040> for<00:04:02.190> them<00:04:02.310> so<00:04:02.459> that's<00:04:02.519> really<00:04:02.730> cool

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
provided for them so that's really cool

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.060 
provided for them so that's really cool
but<00:04:03.690> again<00:04:03.930> it's<00:04:04.320> gonna<00:04:04.530> be<00:04:04.709> interesting<00:04:04.859> to

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
but again it's gonna be interesting to

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.860 
but again it's gonna be interesting to
see<00:04:05.250> how<00:04:05.519> long<00:04:05.579> this<00:04:05.940> kind<00:04:06.150> of<00:04:06.239> paint<00:04:06.450> lasts

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
see how long this kind of paint lasts

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.180 
see how long this kind of paint lasts
and<00:04:07.049> whether<00:04:07.079> or<00:04:07.350> not<00:04:07.380> it<00:04:07.620> scratches<00:04:07.950> easily

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
and whether or not it scratches easily

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.440 
and whether or not it scratches easily
also<00:04:08.640> for<00:04:08.760> those<00:04:08.850> of<00:04:08.910> you<00:04:09.090> wondering<00:04:09.329> about

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
know a complete custom computer which

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.700 
know a complete custom computer which
they<00:04:44.729> have<00:04:44.820> to<00:04:44.940> disassemble<00:04:45.570> and<00:04:45.810> paint<00:04:46.470> and

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
they have to disassemble and paint and

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:47.900 
they have to disassemble and paint and
reassemble<00:04:47.310> so<00:04:47.400> that's<00:04:47.580> a<00:04:47.669> much<00:04:47.850> more

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
reassemble so that's a much more

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.969 
reassemble so that's a much more
expensive<00:04:48.300> process<00:04:48.960> and<00:04:49.200> you'll<00:04:49.620> see<00:04:49.830> that

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
expensive process and you'll see that

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:52.240
