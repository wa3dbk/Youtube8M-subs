both<00:02:15.430> sides<00:02:17.610> normally<00:02:18.610> you'd<00:02:18.730> have<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:18.940> do<00:02:19.060> a

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
both sides normally you'd have to do a

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.090 
both sides normally you'd have to do a
lot<00:02:19.390> of<00:02:19.540> manipulating<00:02:20.080> to<00:02:20.320> get<00:02:20.440> a<00:02:20.470> regular<00:02:20.860> pad

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
pretty good get down to a section of the

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.450 
pretty good get down to a section of the
instrument<00:02:44.110> and<00:02:44.200> it<00:02:44.320> just<00:02:44.590> doesn't<00:02:45.040> play<00:02:45.160> well

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
instrument and it just doesn't play well

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.970 
instrument and it just doesn't play well
they<00:02:45.610> squeak<00:02:46.090> a<00:02:46.330> lot<00:02:46.540> they<00:02:47.110> get<00:02:47.320> just<00:02:47.650> down<00:02:47.830> to

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
they squeak a lot they get just down to

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.060 
they squeak a lot they get just down to
a<00:02:48.010> certain<00:02:48.310> area<00:02:49.050> coming<00:02:50.050> down<00:02:50.290> here<00:02:50.560> you<00:02:50.920> get

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
a certain area coming down here you get

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.010 
a certain area coming down here you get
to<00:02:51.160> this<00:02:51.310> part<00:02:51.580> of<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.730> instrument<00:02:52.360> and<00:02:52.510> it's

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
to this part of the instrument and it's

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.100 
to this part of the instrument and it's
just<00:02:53.290> not<00:02:53.440> working<00:02:53.680> so<00:02:54.460> typically<00:02:55.150> when<00:02:56.020> you

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
just not working so typically when you

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.560 
just not working so typically when you
have<00:02:56.290> a<00:02:56.320> problem<00:02:56.880> somewhere<00:02:57.880> down<00:02:58.060> here

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
have a problem somewhere down here

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.440 
have a problem somewhere down here
the<00:02:59.140> cause<00:02:59.380> is<00:02:59.740> up<00:03:00.340> here<00:03:00.550> or<00:03:00.700> it's<00:03:00.910> a<00:03:01.000> little

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
the cause is up here or it's a little

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.410 
the cause is up here or it's a little
further<00:03:01.720> up<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.740> chain<00:03:02.770> so<00:03:03.730> again<00:03:04.150> we'll

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
further up the chain so again we'll

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.360 
further up the chain so again we'll
examine<00:03:05.380> our<00:03:05.650> instrument<00:03:06.160> and<00:03:07.980> bladder<00:03:08.980> pads

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
examine our instrument and bladder pads

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.050 
examine our instrument and bladder pads
are<00:03:09.760> a<00:03:09.790> are<00:03:10.540> found<00:03:11.500> on<00:03:11.650> most<00:03:11.950> clarinets<00:03:12.610> it's<00:03:12.940> a

this case the pad is still attached to

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.000 
this case the pad is still attached to
the<00:03:33.550> instrument<00:03:33.870> but<00:03:34.870> it's<00:03:35.050> just<00:03:35.200> got<00:03:35.410> felt<00:03:35.709> so

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
the instrument but it's just got felt so

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.979 
the instrument but it's just got felt so
we<00:03:36.580> take<00:03:36.790> a<00:03:36.820> piece<00:03:37.150> of<00:03:37.180> cloth<00:03:37.930> or<00:03:38.320> felt<00:03:38.620> and<00:03:39.989> we

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
we take a piece of cloth or felt and we

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:42.870 
we take a piece of cloth or felt and we
can<00:03:41.140> blow<00:03:41.320> through<00:03:41.530> that<00:03:41.739> the<00:03:42.340> same<00:03:42.610> thing<00:03:42.850> is

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
can blow through that the same thing is

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.400 
can blow through that the same thing is
going<00:03:43.030> to<00:03:43.090> happen<00:03:43.510> there<00:03:43.690> air<00:03:43.870> is<00:03:44.170> going<00:03:44.320> to

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
going to happen there air is going to

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.580 
going to happen there air is going to
leak<00:03:44.680> around<00:03:45.660> that<00:03:46.660> stuff<00:03:46.959> but<00:03:47.200> if<00:03:47.320> we<00:03:47.440> had<00:03:47.560> a

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
leak around that stuff but if we had a

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.820 
leak around that stuff but if we had a
big<00:03:47.769> enough<00:03:47.980> piece<00:03:48.220> of<00:03:48.459> our<00:03:48.580> Teflon<00:03:49.350> it<00:03:50.350> won't

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
big enough piece of our Teflon it won't

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.009 
big enough piece of our Teflon it won't
blow<00:03:51.100> through<00:03:51.340> that<00:03:51.489> this<00:03:51.610> is<00:03:51.760> absolutely

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
blow through that this is absolutely

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.509 
blow through that this is absolutely
airtight<00:03:53.019> so<00:03:53.590> again<00:03:54.489> we<00:03:55.060> just<00:03:55.300> find<00:03:55.660> our

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
airtight so again we just find our

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:03.509 
airtight so again we just find our
offending<00:03:58.830> think<00:03:59.830> it's<00:03:59.980> a<00:04:00.040> good<00:04:00.459> idea<00:04:02.340> to<00:04:03.340> cut

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
offending think it's a good idea to cut

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:04.410 
offending think it's a good idea to cut
these<00:04:03.640> with<00:04:03.820> a<00:04:03.850> razor<00:04:04.060> blade

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
these with a razor blade

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.500 
these with a razor blade
but<00:04:04.930> again<00:04:05.140> this<00:04:05.560> is<00:04:05.800> your<00:04:06.459> clarinet<00:04:06.970> repair

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
but again this is your clarinet repair

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.550 
but again this is your clarinet repair
kit<00:04:07.750> a<00:04:08.610> one<00:04:09.610> roll<00:04:09.850> of<00:04:10.000> this<00:04:10.180> in<00:04:10.390> your<00:04:10.540> case<00:04:10.780> will

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
kit a one roll of this in your case will

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.740 
kit a one roll of this in your case will
solve<00:04:11.920> a<00:04:12.310> multitude<00:04:13.300> of<00:04:13.750> problems<00:04:14.470> so<00:04:15.330> we<00:04:16.330> open

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
solve a multitude of problems so we open

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.420 
solve a multitude of problems so we open
up<00:04:16.840> the<00:04:17.049> pad<00:04:17.459> we<00:04:18.459> have<00:04:18.760> the<00:04:19.120> Teflon<00:04:20.250> spread<00:04:21.250> out

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
up the pad we have the Teflon spread out

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.030 
up the pad we have the Teflon spread out
smooth

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.770
