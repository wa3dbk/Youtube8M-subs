00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
a pivotal role that I think it would

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.520 
a pivotal role that I think it would
just<00:02:32.790> be<00:02:32.940> ridiculous<00:02:33.750> to<00:02:33.900> leave<00:02:34.020> it<00:02:34.170> out<00:02:34.290> in

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
just be ridiculous to leave it out in

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.680 
just be ridiculous to leave it out in
these<00:02:34.680> games<00:02:35.040> but<00:02:35.700> that's<00:02:35.850> my<00:02:36.000> opinion

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
these games but that's my opinion

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.930 
these games but that's my opinion
