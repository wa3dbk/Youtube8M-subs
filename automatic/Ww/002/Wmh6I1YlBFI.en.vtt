 no 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.670
 e 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.220
 paulo and julien decided to use 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:42.060
 flexible English canes to limit 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:44.400
 stall it's where they go well for 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.650
 all that is platelets for fishing 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.600
 the pads the bremen for the wire 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.690
 to fish English I took 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.540
 special english films cdu 17 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.400
 hundredths so it's still 17 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.020
 hundredths which size pretty big so 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.440
 it's still pretty rigid 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.879
 it prevents tangles and its 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.540
 backstage much easier than a 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.240
 15 hundredths so here is the float 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:14.520
 sliding it well rested directly 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.500
 on a closeup like that it spreads in 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.170
 does the body of the float relative 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.909
 to the threads so I put three big shots 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.590
 to pass big pellets of two grams 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:28.799
 and I put two baby leads of 0.50 a 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.720
 lead of two implants of 4 that's for 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.430
 well see the touching statement gmi I 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.190
 am going to attack with three touch lead 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.630
 on morals and lyon and then after I 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.860
 may eventually go down one or 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.510
 two weights of the main mass towards 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.160
 the Rays 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.800
 if ever the wind gets up during 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.560
 fishing and need to have a low 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.850
 line that hold better at the bottom where 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.070
 you have to be careful it's only about 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.660
 its floats they can tend 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.150
 to unscrew during fishing 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:01.590
 so what I do to prevent that 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:04.470
 happens and to avoid sticking them to the 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:10.890
 glue because sometimes during fishing 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:13.050
 we can add pucks I put 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.599
 actually an O-ring it's a seal 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.569
 rubber ring that I just fixed 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:21.120
 between the momentum float base of the blow the 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.670
 float when I screw it on the rod 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.129
 he comes he'll come crush the seal 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.489
 toric and it's going to avoid contest of 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.290
 peach 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:33.840
 he unscrews himself and loses the float 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.379
 we come alive it's over and here we 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.870
 can fish 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:39.390
 you can fish for four hours 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.390
 in a row throwing bringing back goethe in 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.440
 bringing back 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.260
 the o-ring that comes to do 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.880
 plugs and suddenly the lan base of 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.220
 float is not going to go unscrew 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.860
 during the fishing 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.500
 the lead pump is sealed for our co 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:59.180
 license that I use most often at 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.470
 least at least to plomber of departure and I 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.360
 advise anyone who hears 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.209
 problems we protect backstage between 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.640
 the symbols regularly 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.590
 I found that 60 to 70 hundred damas 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.319
 main 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.299
 located at 60 70 thinking of mourinho 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.689
 it was usually a good distance 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.689
 to avoid 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.750
 then that's it for the main 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.750
 well he added 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.220
 he 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.130
 here 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.800
 portel I go down in a few 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.800
 weeks 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.439
 it 's even easier when you're 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:55.420
 as soon as he feels good that big andrÃ© 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:58.629
 it goes down too quickly a mass 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.260
 important and sometimes December 200's of 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:02.050
 number 8 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:06.430
 this is much better than down two 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:08.050
 9 2 4 we have as far as the 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.430
 pump and but especially especially this space 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.520
 between the links and the plumbing 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:15.010
 main 60 70 cm a shape that's 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.709
 a good distance to avoid getting 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.360
 to mix here and then after we could avoid 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.970
 to get involved but you have to go 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.940
 go there throw and then take a 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.320
 helping hand so there for example it can 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.660
 serve to put the antennas more 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.330
 fine and on the other side 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.820
 so you have to be busy if not believed 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:37.420
 have a concern on the other side the same 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:41.290
 so we have this box for antennas 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:45.370
 a little bigger here is with 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:47.710
 an antenna box we can do on 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.390
 these for example on his floats with 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.420
 crutches carbon 4 sizes 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:54.130
 different antenna so the more 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:57.850
 fine for peaches we will really say 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:00.610
 small delicate platelet technique 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:03.130
 and this one to have a little more 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.600
 of importance is true that there we can 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:08.740
 hang out a little bit more and put some 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:11.830
 lead on the bottom that's how often 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.900
 we fish with two three flush 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.440
 bottoms often the keys that's 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.400
 of these are readings so by painting 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.110
 the float antenna of another 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.810
 color it allows to see more 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.060
 easily pick them up rather than 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.310
 ask the question is what the float 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.720
 he went back up enough or not enough 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:33.070
 what am I doing or what am I doing 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:35.440
 meal the red decla fate I do it 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:38.400
 even when there is wind we see face 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.400
 more easily pick them up 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:44.849
 during this time paulo explains you 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.989
 how to equip a cane da lenders 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:49.110
 are my job at best 

00:05:45.989 --> 00:05:51.389
 at the end and that 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:54.959
 even to the European budget rivers he 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:57.179
 never quinta when you do not put 

00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:58.709
 to the father to initiate this maze angelic 

00:05:57.179 --> 00:06:01.529
 lesser wind that has just taken in 

00:05:58.709 --> 00:06:04.769
 drift satan the banner when everything to 

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:05.999
 blow with this mounting me forever 

00:06:04.769 --> 00:06:07.919
 that's all I probed I love you 

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:09.629
 European bad and eating go drinking 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:11.249
 the aperitif that will make storm or any 

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:12.809
 what it will be forgotten and because you are 

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:14.189
 especially cap mayor not leads twice 

00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:17.620
 confused what france info toc 

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:19.750
 the 60 grams and 80 grams at the bottom 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:22.180
 for a fortnight there I'm trying the thread 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.190
 pink to make ligatures at the level 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.139
 of the fishing distance and that's right 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:28.080
 than 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:30.509
 in the you see them better than the 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.639
 ligatures threads yellow neon you see 

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:34.590
 easily more easily arrive on 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:37.889
 pink thread on the water especially when she 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:41.719
 is green like that the game in 12 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:45.349
 hundredths it goes well in the rings 

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:45.349
 that's okay
