00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:18.980 
hmm yeah I think there has to be some
kind<00:04:17.640> of<00:04:17.700> social<00:04:17.880> awareness<00:04:18.180> to<00:04:18.630> all<00:04:18.720> of<00:04:18.870> this

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:18.990

so the person who's going to who's going
to<00:04:22.020> have<00:04:22.140> to<00:04:22.260> do<00:04:22.770> something<00:04:22.980> about<00:04:23.130> this<00:04:23.370> it'll

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
to have to do something about this it'll

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.880 
to have to do something about this it'll
