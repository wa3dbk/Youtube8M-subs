00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:04.990
 hi everyone today I am 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.939
 there to make my top five of may red 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.140
 favorite lipsticks of the moment these are the 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:09.549
 five lipsticks that I wear on the 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.870
 more in recent weeks and you 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:13.150
 see that there is a lot of red to 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.110
 colorful lips I thought the 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.580
 spring was coming 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.870
 but here in the Paris area it was 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.130
 a false alarm we had two days of 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.970
 spring and now he makes it to 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.420
 again all the beds and everything 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.760
 disgusting 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.410
 so I decided that if the sun does not 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.270
 did not come out they were going to come on 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.700
 my face and I wear color 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.920
 in short all that to tell you that I you 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.930
 shows that in itself in music with 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.610
 special effects and means 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.390
 so amazing if you're interested 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.390
 stay here 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.970
 years 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.810
 m 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.810
 at 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.530
 1 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.700
 and here to finish I'll give you 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.400
 a little tip that I learned from my 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.440
 mom I wear here the sun power of 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.270
 mac is a lipstick a matte finish and 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.060
 which is dark enough and it is 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.920
 impossible to remove with one of 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.810
 normal makeup artists with a makeup remover 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.790
 biphasic j happens pretty much but it takes 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.100
 that I rub for a very long time 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.080
 before arriving at any remove it and me 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.650
 hurts a lot less than it is very dry 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.180
 so I wanted to give you the tip 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.040
 maybe some of you 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.170
 already know almond oil 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.430
 sweet then this one is a mat and 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.900
 meaning that I bought at crossroads little 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.120
 important than any oil 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.860
 sweet almond and in fact the almonds 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.510
 soft in addition to peeling off the pigments 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.570
 like any oil 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.950
 cleanser would do it will feed your 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.750
 lips at the same time which makes that 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.760
 you will be able to rub for 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.400
 hours if you want without ever having 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.380
 wrong and without having the skin that goes with 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.780
 or the mouth that is stuck on the cotton 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.550
 so demonstration I show you 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:42.430
 quickly I take a handkerchief all 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:45.660
 I simply put oil on it and 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.380
 I gently rub on my lips 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.720
 gently on my lips it's 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.720
 so beautiful and you will see that 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:04:00.550
 youth to his blÃ©riot but the 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.970
 pigment is coming off very very well and in 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.160
 made 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.370
 now I will be able to rub 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.870
 rub rub and gesca remove everything and 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.920
 I have no feeling of tugging 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.920
 on the lips 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.640
 no feeling of drought I 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.560
 you tell me tell me I have the impression 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.480
 that the township will stay down you I'm going 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.280
 to stay stuck on it is terrible so 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.109
 this one especially the red ones to 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.850
 matte lips if you do not have some of 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.040
 at mac who hold extremely well 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:28.120
 are very difficult to remove and 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.470
 dishes no problem and the oil 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.060
 sweet almonds you have to have any 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.620
 home way me I tell you it's a 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.600
 indispensable if you are at war 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.330
 make-up removers it works on 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.710
 burns on dry skin on your 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.160
 bad bins to put on the face on 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.330
 the body etc for babies it's very 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.169
 very recommended for babies' skin 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.580
 but really that for the red for 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:50.800
 lips especially for me it's 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.810
 very very useful because I have the 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.100
 extremely dry lips and I can not 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.850
 remove makeup balm 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:00.370
 to remove makeup meters from the edge so that's 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.510
 a great trick so thanks mom and if 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.430

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.270
