equals<00:01:44.369> infinity<00:01:44.520> okay

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.770 

classical<00:01:52.700> music<00:01:53.119> has<00:01:53.299> the<00:01:53.750> power<00:01:54.140> to<00:01:54.640> evoke

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
classical music has the power to evoke

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.160 
classical music has the power to evoke
complex<00:01:56.780> emotions<00:01:57.490> emotions<00:01:58.490> that<00:01:58.939> are

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
complex emotions emotions that are

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.270 
complex emotions emotions that are
almost<00:02:00.170> beyond<00:02:00.469> words

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
almost beyond words

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.870 
almost beyond words
and<00:02:02.439> I<00:02:03.439> think<00:02:03.560> one<00:02:03.860> of<00:02:03.979> the<00:02:04.069> sad<00:02:04.399> things<00:02:04.520> is

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
and I think one of the sad things is

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.300 
and I think one of the sad things is
that<00:02:05.090> people<00:02:05.450> often<00:02:05.780> stereotype<00:02:06.679> classical

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
that people often stereotype classical

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.969 
that people often stereotype classical
music<00:02:07.610> as<00:02:07.729> being<00:02:07.969> too<00:02:08.239> sophisticated<00:02:08.629> for<00:02:09.170> too

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
music as being too sophisticated for too

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.230 
music as being too sophisticated for too
snooty

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
snooty

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.270 
snooty
I<00:02:13.670> think<00:02:14.670> one<00:02:14.910> of<00:02:14.940> our<00:02:15.150> goal<00:02:15.480> should<00:02:15.510> be<00:02:15.840> to

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
I think one of our goal should be to

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.400 
I think one of our goal should be to
make<00:02:17.450> classical<00:02:18.450> music<00:02:18.780> irrelevant<00:02:19.320> to

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
make classical music irrelevant to

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.600 
make classical music irrelevant to
everyone<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.100> I<00:02:20.490> think<00:02:20.820> in<00:02:21.000> that<00:02:21.390> sense<00:02:22.610> the

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
everyone and I think in that sense the

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.480 
everyone and I think in that sense the
Youth<00:02:23.820> Orchestra<00:02:24.200> is<00:02:25.200> an<00:02:25.410> integral<00:02:25.950> part<00:02:26.220> of

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
Youth Orchestra is an integral part of

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.780 
Youth Orchestra is an integral part of
changing<00:02:27.360> that<00:02:27.540> mindset
