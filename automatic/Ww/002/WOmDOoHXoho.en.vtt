00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.330
 the indicator is small enough to 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.000
 to distract from work even in the dark 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.380
 indoors and with it enough

 from gaming gtx series 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.810
 in our case, this is nvidia geforce gtx

 128 or 256 gigabytes 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.560
 a real highlight of the configuration

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.620
 energy savings and little over an hour to 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.620
 game mode 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:45.450
 in the end, acer aspire 18 metro is quite 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.700

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.270
 performance is more than enough 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.270
 excellent screen office will allow me 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.350
 think about buying an external monitor
