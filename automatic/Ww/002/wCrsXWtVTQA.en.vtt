00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
loss and how I recognize it is these two

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.039 
loss and how I recognize it is these two
are<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.320> same<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.729> these<00:01:36.090> are<00:01:36.570> in<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:36.840> one's

are the same and these are in this one's

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.249 
are the same and these are in this one's
opposite<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.490> one<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.880> these<00:01:39.689> two<00:01:39.750> this

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
opposite of this one and these two this

opposite of this one and these two this
one<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.619> just<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.950> random<00:01:41.130> color<00:01:41.520> so<00:01:42.240> random

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
one is just a random color so random

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.910 
one is just a random color so random
color<00:01:42.810> these<00:01:43.170> two<00:01:43.380> are<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.530> same

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
color these two are the same

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.569 
color these two are the same
that<00:01:44.610> one's<00:01:44.930> opposite<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:46.110> these<00:01:47.070> two<00:01:47.310> and

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
that one's opposite of these two and

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:55.340 
that one's opposite of these two and
just<00:01:47.810> do<00:01:48.810> Nick<00:01:49.049> gloss<00:01:51.079> so

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.730 

next<00:01:56.350> one<00:01:57.210> these<00:01:58.210> two<00:01:58.270> are<00:01:58.870> opposites<00:01:59.530> and

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
next one these two are opposites and

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.690 
next one these two are opposites and
these<00:02:00.550> two<00:02:00.820> are<00:02:00.940> opposites<00:02:01.420> so<00:02:02.010> these<00:02:03.010> two<00:02:03.250> red

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
these two are opposites so these two red

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.520 
these two are opposites so these two red
and<00:02:03.730> orange<00:02:04.510> are<00:02:04.630> opposites<00:02:05.080> and<00:02:05.230> then<00:02:05.350> these

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
and orange are opposites and then these

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.620 
and orange are opposites and then these
two<00:02:05.740> right<00:02:05.860> here<00:02:06.010> are<00:02:06.070> opposites<00:02:06.610> and<00:02:06.820> I<00:02:07.570> do

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
two right here are opposites and I do

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:17.400 
two right here are opposites and I do
this<00:02:13.530> next<00:02:14.530> one<00:02:14.830> I<00:02:15.480> recognize<00:02:16.480> that<00:02:16.510> these<00:02:17.080> two

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
this next one I recognize that these two

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.500 
this next one I recognize that these two
are<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.740> same<00:02:17.980> and<00:02:18.220> this<00:02:18.520> one<00:02:18.730> is<00:02:18.880> opposite

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
are the same and this one is opposite

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.800 
are the same and this one is opposite
and<00:02:19.750> this<00:02:20.680> one<00:02:20.860> is<00:02:20.980> just<00:02:21.130> a<00:02:21.280> random<00:02:21.670> color<00:02:21.880> so

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
and this one is just a random color so

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.900 
and this one is just a random color so
these<00:02:23.140> two<00:02:23.380> are<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.650> same<00:02:23.890> this<00:02:24.670> one's

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
these two are the same this one's

this<00:04:53.720> hold<00:04:54.530> it<00:04:54.680> here<00:04:54.919> and<00:05:00.430> this<00:05:01.430> one<00:05:01.640> is<00:05:01.669> just

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
this hold it here and this one is just

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.760 
this hold it here and this one is just
Nick<00:05:02.180> loss<00:05:02.390> and<00:05:02.750> I<00:05:02.870> ring<00:05:03.080> at<00:05:03.320> it<00:05:03.470> like<00:05:03.590> this

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
Nick loss and I ring at it like this

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.090 
Nick loss and I ring at it like this
these<00:05:04.640> two<00:05:04.970> are<00:05:05.000> the<00:05:05.660> same<00:05:05.780> and<00:05:06.290> this<00:05:07.040> is

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 
these two are the same and this is

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.710 
these two are the same and this is
opposite<00:05:08.000> of<00:05:08.620> these<00:05:09.620> two<00:05:09.919> so<00:05:10.790> same<00:05:11.120> this<00:05:11.570> is

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
opposite of these two so same this is

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.060 
opposite of these two so same this is
opposite<00:05:12.080> of<00:05:12.200> these<00:05:12.320> two<00:05:12.500> and<00:05:12.650> then<00:05:12.770> there's<00:05:12.950> a

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
opposite of these two and then there's a

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.640 
opposite of these two and then there's a
right<00:05:13.250> um<00:05:13.400> sticker<00:05:13.700> and<00:05:13.970> I<00:05:14.870> execute<00:05:15.350> this<00:05:15.470> one

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
right um sticker and I execute this one

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.680 
right um sticker and I execute this one
two<00:05:15.860> ways<00:05:16.040> this<00:05:16.460> is<00:05:16.520> the<00:05:16.669> one<00:05:16.940> that<00:05:17.120> I<00:05:17.150> prefer

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.080 

and<00:05:20.690> if<00:05:21.320> I'm<00:05:21.500> stuck<00:05:21.800> with<00:05:22.040> this<00:05:22.310> angle<00:05:22.820> that<00:05:23.030> I

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
and if I'm stuck with this angle that I

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.530 
and if I'm stuck with this angle that I
do<00:05:23.210> this<00:05:24.700> which<00:05:25.700> is<00:05:25.729> probably<00:05:26.090> what<00:05:26.210> most<00:05:26.240> of

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540 
do this which is probably what most of

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.490 
do this which is probably what most of
you<00:05:26.660> do<00:05:28.300> then<00:05:29.300> for<00:05:29.510> this<00:05:29.660> one<00:05:29.870> I<00:05:29.990> recognize

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
you do then for this one I recognize

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.260 
you do then for this one I recognize
that<00:05:30.530> these<00:05:30.860> two<00:05:31.100> are<00:05:31.190> the<00:05:31.250> same<00:05:31.370> and<00:05:31.820> this<00:05:32.030> one

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
that these two are the same and this one

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.719 
that these two are the same and this one
is<00:05:32.390> opposite<00:05:32.960> of<00:05:33.080> these<00:05:33.260> two<00:05:33.560> so<00:05:34.340> these<00:05:34.550> two

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:34.729 
is opposite of these two so these two

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:36.670 
is opposite of these two so these two
are<00:05:34.760> the<00:05:34.880> same<00:05:34.970> and<00:05:35.390> this<00:05:35.690> one<00:05:35.840> is<00:05:35.960> opposite<00:05:36.560> of

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
are the same and this one is opposite of

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.560 
are the same and this one is opposite of
what<00:05:36.979> these<00:05:37.100> two<00:05:37.160> are<00:05:37.370> and<00:05:37.940> then<00:05:38.270> there's<00:05:38.479> a

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
what these two are and then there's a

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.350 
what these two are and then there's a
random<00:05:38.780> sticker<00:05:39.190> and<00:05:40.190> then<00:05:40.310> I<00:05:40.340> hold<00:05:40.640> it<00:05:41.300> like

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
random sticker and then I hold it like

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:47.450 
random sticker and then I hold it like
this<00:05:41.900> and<00:05:42.169> do<00:05:42.320> this

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.760 

and<00:05:48.460> then<00:05:48.640> the<00:05:48.760> last<00:05:48.970> one<00:05:49.240> I<00:05:49.510> recognize<00:05:50.320> that

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
and then the last one I recognize that

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.190 
and then the last one I recognize that
these<00:05:51.070> two<00:05:51.340> are<00:05:51.640> opposites<00:05:52.210> and<00:05:52.390> these<00:05:52.900> two

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:53.200 
these two are opposites and these two

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.290 
these two are opposites and these two
are<00:05:53.470> the<00:05:53.530> same<00:05:53.770> so<00:05:54.760> these<00:05:54.910> two<00:05:55.090> are<00:05:55.150> the<00:05:55.240> same

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300 
are the same so these two are the same

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:02.700 
are the same so these two are the same
these<00:05:56.230> are<00:05:56.440> opposite<00:05:56.860> what<00:05:57.310> I<00:05:57.400> do<00:05:57.460> this<00:06:01.710> so

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
these are opposite what I do this so

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.480 
these are opposite what I do this so
that's<00:06:02.860> how<00:06:03.160> I<00:06:03.870> recognize<00:06:04.870> and<00:06:05.170> execute<00:06:06.040> these

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 
that's how I recognize and execute these

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:11.730 
that's how I recognize and execute these
soon<00:06:06.880> and<00:06:07.300> anti<00:06:07.810> soon<00:06:08.050> sets<00:06:08.590> for<00:06:09.040> CLL
