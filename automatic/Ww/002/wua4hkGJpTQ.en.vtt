00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
because if you have three addicts area

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.040 
because if you have three addicts area
if<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:50.520> have<00:02:50.670> more<00:02:50.910> than<00:02:50.970> three<00:02:51.270> alex's<00:02:51.660> agar

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
will scatter when the Raj casts just

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.330 
will scatter when the Raj casts just
like<00:02:59.160> it's<00:02:59.310> about<00:02:59.400> to

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
normal veil sins do but my way is just

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.300 

again<00:04:15.410> you<00:04:15.530> don't<00:04:15.560> want<00:04:15.740> to<00:04:15.890> get<00:04:15.980> stuck<00:04:16.100> when

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
again you don't want to get stuck when

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.030 
again you don't want to get stuck when
you're<00:04:16.459> pulling<00:04:16.580> these<00:04:16.760> things<00:04:17.830> although<00:04:18.830> in

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
you're pulling these things although in

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.070 
you're pulling these things although in
this<00:04:19.130> case<00:04:19.190> since<00:04:19.820> you're<00:04:20.000> have<00:04:20.840> debts

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
this case since you're have debts

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.390 
this case since you're have debts
charged<00:04:21.410> it's<00:04:21.620> not<00:04:21.739> really<00:04:21.920> that<00:04:22.040> big<00:04:22.220> of<00:04:22.280> a

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
charged it's not really that big of a

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.430 
charged it's not really that big of a
deal<00:04:22.490> it's<00:04:23.150> just<00:04:23.330> a<00:04:23.390> waste<00:04:23.540> of<00:04:23.660> time<00:04:23.750> and<00:04:23.900> an

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
deal it's just a waste of time and an

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:38.290 
deal it's just a waste of time and an
annoyance

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:46.640 

gonna<00:04:38.990> get<00:04:39.080> all<00:04:39.259> these<00:04:39.409> grasp<00:04:39.680> groups

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.620 

and<00:04:47.190> then<00:04:47.699> this<00:04:47.790> is<00:04:47.850> where<00:04:48.090> I<00:04:48.150> differ<00:04:48.360> a<00:04:48.509> little

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
and then this is where I differ a little

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.780 
and then this is where I differ a little
bit<00:04:48.810> for<00:04:48.960> most<00:04:49.139> wheel<00:04:49.350> since<00:04:49.590> a<00:04:49.889> lot<00:04:50.610> of<00:04:50.639> them

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
bit for most wheel since a lot of them

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.159 
bit for most wheel since a lot of them
will<00:04:50.970> pull<00:04:51.150> them<00:04:51.300> behind<00:04:51.479> the<00:04:51.630> house<00:04:51.780> but<00:04:52.050> if<00:04:52.110> i

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
will pull them behind the house but if i

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:56.719 
will pull them behind the house but if i
use<00:04:52.350> this<00:04:52.500> fence<00:04:55.160> there's<00:04:56.160> a<00:04:56.250> little<00:04:56.460> dip<00:04:56.699> in
