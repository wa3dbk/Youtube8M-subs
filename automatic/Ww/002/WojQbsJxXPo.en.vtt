00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:09.230
 save your life save your life 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:09.230
 boyfriend is winking is flooding on i 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.690
 [Music] 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:18.359
 and, um, beauty, I came back here with more 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:23.640
 a video and this time I brought it here 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:27.539
 the gta4 channel I downloaded is a version and 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:32.130
 that if I remember correctly, it was black box, right? 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:35.760
 and so it took two hours to install 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.879
 all this stuff but then good O 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.860
 As you can see there, you can not 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.610
 play this game or comper compromise 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:49.020
 clear nÃ© game wheel and with a fps rate 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:54.270
 of 89 frame is recording right 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.260
 and without recording it runs and with 10 9 frames 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.469
 also ne 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.879
 because it is wheel and with the going of these 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.220
 premises 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:07.860
 How you two must be, do not you? 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:11.630
 scenery neither one nor one carries it all 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.670
 invisible and playable of course 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:18.659
 so even if you could not 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:22.590
 even if you wanted to play there at 10 frames 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:25.799
 you would not play for long for 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.110
 cause of this map bug that does not 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.840
 carries then no use 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.890
 so if you have one I thought a little 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.299
 better than mine I think I'd even give 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.680
 to play nÃ© 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.630
 I do not know now if you have an equal pc 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.079
 or weaker than mine 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.360
 It's kind of complicated to play there, right? 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.790
 so this is it people I hope the 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.040
 video has been useful to you, do not 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.290
 forget to leave your home and that 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.750
 You liked the video, right? 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:25.189
 so that's it and until the next video 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:25.189
 [Music] 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:03:05.239
 [Music] 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.239
 is
