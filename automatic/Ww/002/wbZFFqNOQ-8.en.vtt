00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.200
 devil may cry is the restart of one of 

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:10.840
 the most successful capcom franchises 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.730
 in the last generation that with everything and 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.119
 the controversial design of the new dante 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.160
 come back to shut up mouths we control 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.140
 dante that is a mixture of angel and 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.840
 demon that has a full rhythm of life 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.270
 of women fights and alcohol until 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.610
 cat appears who is part of a 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.140
 organization branded as terrorist 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.750
 by the manipulated means of 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.460
 communication and gives rise to a series of 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.170
 events that lead us to face 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.079
 thousands of demons through two 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.989
 dimensions the plot is attractive and 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.730
 exciting but very short and suddenly 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.309
 we feel that it is counted by means of 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.180
 too many kinematics what cuts the 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.340
 game experience 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.800
 we play a hack and slash full of 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.280
 action at the start we have the sword 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.810
 rebellion and the ebony / ivory pistols 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.760
 although over time we become a 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.770
 more complex arsenal that we have to 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.379
 adapt according to the enemy that we face 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.330
 the idea is to eliminate how much demon 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.160
 displayed by 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.710
 attacks in combo that we will be improving 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.140
 with the passage of the game we find a 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.270
 number of enemies very varied each 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.640
 one can be defeated with different 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.740
 amount of mechanical shocks or weapons 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.720
 in addition to the sub-heads and the 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.149
 impressive level bosses that we 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.340
 they need to pay attention to the environment to 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.340
 decide the best way to face them 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.909
 the visual work is wonderful to see 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.789
 how the environment is destroyed 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.159
 move the limb is so amazing 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:39.289
 like the grotesque design of the enemies 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.990
 and heads of level that fits in great 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:44.420
 shape the new concept to itself the 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.700
 Art work is worth mentioning with 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.000
 strange and risky ideas that give us 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.159
 a very special experience the band 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.840
 sound is very good guitars 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.360
 electrical are modified 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.549
 depending on the enemies music that 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.549
 merges seamlessly with the game 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.180
 leaving aside the controversial redesign 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.220
 dante undoubtedly Ninja Theory has 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.770
 achieved a great job with the new 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.510
 drawing max wright a dynamic game and 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.290
 fun with a very good story 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:19.580
 told that will keep us very attentive 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.580
 final grade 83
