alright both of them finished again the

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.530 
alright both of them finished again the

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
second why does a galaxy s I'll 18t have

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.700 
second why does a galaxy s I'll 18t have
a<00:03:00.660> point<00:03:01.020> those<00:03:01.440> 6<00:03:03.020> megabytes<00:03:04.020> per<00:03:04.320> second

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
a point those 6 megabytes per second

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.700 
a point those 6 megabytes per second
wires<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.130> upload<00:03:05.490> speed<00:03:05.520> is<00:03:06.030> point<00:03:06.660> one<00:03:07.050> make

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
wires the upload speed is point one make

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.260 
wires the upload speed is point one make
bytes<00:03:07.920> per<00:03:08.010> second<00:03:08.460> and<00:03:09.170> so<00:03:10.170> I<00:03:10.200> guess<00:03:11.270> the

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
bytes per second and so I guess the

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.200 
bytes per second and so I guess the
conclusion<00:03:12.870> is<00:03:13.110> that<00:03:13.550> the<00:03:14.550> download<00:03:15.060> speed

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
conclusion is that the download speed

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.040 
conclusion is that the download speed
for<00:03:16.200> both<00:03:16.350> networks<00:03:16.560> are<00:03:17.100> about<00:03:17.610> Sam<00:03:17.940> but<00:03:18.450> the

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
for both networks are about Sam but the

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.480 
for both networks are about Sam but the
upload<00:03:19.380> speed<00:03:19.820> 18t<00:03:20.820> wings<00:03:21.380> over<00:03:22.380> sprint<00:03:22.710> by<00:03:23.220> a

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
upload speed 18t wings over sprint by a

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.700 
upload speed 18t wings over sprint by a
huge<00:03:24.030> amount<00:03:24.180> all<00:03:25.020> right<00:03:25.200> thanks<00:03:25.560> for

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710 
huge amount all right thanks for
