symmetry<00:00:10.450> can<00:00:10.660> be<00:00:10.809> extremely<00:00:11.320> useful<00:00:11.440> when

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:11.830 
symmetry can be extremely useful when

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.089 
symmetry can be extremely useful when
you're<00:00:12.129> drawing<00:00:12.400> front<00:00:12.969> views<00:00:13.360> of<00:00:13.629> images<00:00:14.200> now

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:15.099 
you're drawing front views of images now

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:16.620 
you're drawing front views of images now
some<00:00:15.339> software<00:00:15.849> will<00:00:15.999> automate<00:00:16.450> this

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:18.670 
mirroring process for you but

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.089 
mirroring process for you but
regrettably<00:00:19.029> Photoshop<00:00:19.779> doesn't<00:00:20.199> so<00:00:20.920> in<00:00:21.010> this

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:21.099 
regrettably Photoshop doesn't so in this

video<00:00:21.250> I'm<00:00:21.640> going<00:00:21.760> to<00:00:21.820> show<00:00:22.000> you<00:00:22.029> how<00:00:22.269> to<00:00:22.330> make

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:22.539 
video I'm going to show you how to make

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.500 
video I'm going to show you how to make
a<00:00:22.570> mirror<00:00:23.080> action<00:00:23.800> and<00:00:23.980> how<00:00:24.789> I<00:00:24.820> like<00:00:25.119> to<00:00:25.240> use<00:00:25.359> it

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:25.510 
a mirror action and how I like to use it

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.519 
a mirror action and how I like to use it
for<00:00:25.539> thumbnailing<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:28.630> to<00:00:28.689> make<00:00:28.869> any<00:00:29.050> action

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:29.529 
for thumbnailing so to make any action

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.290 
for thumbnailing so to make any action
you<00:00:30.039> begin<00:00:30.310> by<00:00:30.429> opening<00:00:30.460> your<00:00:30.789> actions

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
you begin by opening your actions

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.810 
you begin by opening your actions
palette<00:00:32.070> clicking<00:00:33.070> on<00:00:33.190> the<00:00:33.309> create<00:00:33.520> new

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
palette clicking on the create new

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:41.490 
palette clicking on the create new
action<00:00:34.180> button<00:00:34.500> giving<00:00:35.500> it<00:00:35.590> a<00:00:35.649> title<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:41.350> can

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
action button giving it a title you can

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.110 
action button giving it a title you can
also<00:00:41.649> assign<00:00:41.980> a<00:00:42.010> function<00:00:42.430> key<00:00:42.640> which<00:00:42.940> will

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
also assign a function key which will

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.729 
also assign a function key which will
allow<00:00:43.270> you<00:00:43.329> to<00:00:43.450> have<00:00:44.050> a<00:00:44.079> single<00:00:44.469> keystroke

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
allow you to have a single keystroke

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.200 
allow you to have a single keystroke
trigger<00:00:45.460> this<00:00:45.640> action<00:00:46.030> very<00:00:46.660> useful<00:00:48.090> now<00:00:49.090> when

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
trigger this action very useful now when

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.220 
trigger this action very useful now when
I<00:00:49.270> hit<00:00:49.390> record<00:00:49.750> it's<00:00:49.899> going<00:00:49.930> to<00:00:50.079> start

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
I hit record it's going to start

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.650 
I hit record it's going to start
listening<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:53.379> the<00:00:53.500> steps<00:00:53.710> I<00:00:53.890> want<00:00:54.160> are

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
listening so the steps I want are

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:04.439 
listening so the steps I want are
duplicate<00:00:55.660> the<00:00:56.020> layer<00:00:58.530> move<00:00:59.530> the<00:00:59.739> layer<00:01:03.449> flip

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
duplicate the layer move the layer flip

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.030 
duplicate the layer move the layer flip
layer<00:01:04.690> horizontally<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:07.180> confirm<00:01:07.980> at<00:01:08.980> this

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
layer horizontally and confirm at this

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.330 
layer horizontally and confirm at this
point<00:01:09.370> I<00:01:09.430> hit<00:01:09.550> stop<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.740> I've<00:01:11.890> created<00:01:12.130> my

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
point I hit stop and I've created my

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.969 
point I hit stop and I've created my
action

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
action

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.520 
action
so<00:01:14.610> what's<00:01:14.759> it<00:01:14.850> look<00:01:14.939> like<00:01:14.969> in<00:01:15.119> practice<00:01:15.530> well

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
so what's it look like in practice well

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.840 
so what's it look like in practice well
there's<00:01:16.829> a<00:01:16.890> lot<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.159> different<00:01:17.430> ways<00:01:17.579> that<00:01:17.610> you

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
there's a lot of different ways that you

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.240 
there's a lot of different ways that you
can<00:01:18.090> use<00:01:18.329> symmetry<00:01:18.960> but<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.590> like<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.979> use<00:01:20.100> it

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
can use symmetry but I like to use it

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.850 
can use symmetry but I like to use it
most<00:01:20.610> often<00:01:20.789> for<00:01:21.060> thumbnailing<00:01:21.679> so<00:01:22.679> if<00:01:22.770> I'm

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
most often for thumbnailing so if I'm

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.999 
most often for thumbnailing so if I'm
drawing<00:01:23.070> my<00:01:23.250> shape<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:24.140> can<00:01:25.140> focus<00:01:25.320> on<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.619> single

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
drawing my shape I can focus on a single

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.889 
drawing my shape I can focus on a single
side<00:01:26.219> at<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.670> time<00:01:29.360> get<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.450> looking<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.780> way<00:01:30.810> I

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899 
side at a time get it looking the way I

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.490 
side at a time get it looking the way I
want<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.880> maybe<00:01:32.880> erase<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.270> centerline<00:01:33.899> down<00:01:34.350> it

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
want it maybe erase a centerline down it

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.370 
want it maybe erase a centerline down it
and<00:01:35.000> then<00:01:36.000> hit<00:01:36.179> my<00:01:36.329> keyboard<00:01:36.719> shortcut<00:01:37.170> for

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
and then hit my keyboard shortcut for

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.819 
and then hit my keyboard shortcut for
the<00:01:38.069> mirror<00:01:38.340> action<00:01:39.200> and<00:01:40.200> then<00:01:40.469> just<00:01:40.619> line<00:01:40.799> it

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
the mirror action and then just line it

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:49.550 
the mirror action and then just line it
up<00:01:46.189> so<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.250> make<00:01:47.429> a<00:01:47.459> new<00:01:47.670> layer<00:01:48.229> work<00:01:49.229> on<00:01:49.409> my

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
up so I make a new layer work on my

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.499 
up so I make a new layer work on my
thumbnail<00:01:50.340> whatever<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.819> shape<00:01:51.000> may<00:01:51.149> be<00:01:53.509> I'll

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
thumbnail whatever the shape may be I'll

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.529 
thumbnail whatever the shape may be I'll
race<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.899> centerline<00:01:57.409> and<00:01:59.090> use<00:02:00.090> my<00:02:00.270> mirror

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
race that centerline and use my mirror

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:08.840 
race that centerline and use my mirror
action

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.910
