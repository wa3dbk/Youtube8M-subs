00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 Hello dear friends and in this 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.460
 sunny day we will learn how to play 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.560
 for a hero who has such a disease to 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.360
 kleptomania and if he is cured 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.550
 stop stealing from everyone then die 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.660
 exactly five seconds and of course 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.389
 I'm talking about Rubik 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.920
 as usual, I will teach you to buy pumping and 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.500
 many other little things you need 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.650
 lance know this hero Well 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.650
 getting started 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.590
 any sorcerer can use 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.630
 spell or two and some of them 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.700
 they can even study long enough 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.100
 to become a wizard but only the most 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.840
 the talented is allowed to bear the title of magician 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.059
 but like in any other circle 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.980
 sorcerers sense of cohesion never 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.650
 did not guarantee smooth rivalry 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.019
 already known to higher witch circles as 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.540
 duelists scientist Rubik never thought 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:57.269
 that he has the makings of a magician until 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.370
 until they tried to kill him 7 times with 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.440
 sigh throwing out 12 of the so-called 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.540
 kill from his balcony he realized 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.940
 how hopelessly uninteresting steel 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.460
 an attempt on his life he wanted 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.229
 more serious struggle putting on your combat 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.180
 the brain he did what any would do 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.780
 the wizard is willing to advance in 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.119
 community 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.760
 he announced his intentions to kill the mage 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.590
 soon Rubik realized that attacking one 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.380
 mage he attacked them all and those 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.060
 fell on him with all his might but very 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.640
 Soon something happened that Rubik's enemies did not 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.330
 expected their skill turned against 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.760
 them yourself 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.650
 no one could rely on him 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.290
 when he applied for acceptance 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.420
 exposed council then 11 elected as one 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.240
 agreed to give him the title of the great 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.130
 magician is truly an interesting story but here 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.830
 the question is whether to teach you to give rubik 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.050
 Of course you need as you thought early 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.210
 stages of the game we buy courier and wards she 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.440
 you can buy the rest yourself 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.820
 believe tango hilku or two branches 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.980
 small note if in the time already 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.500
 there is a support who bought kuru and wards 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.380
 then you can buy a battle and go to the mid but 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.120
 it all depends on the situation during the middle 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.030
 stages of the game you must have arcana 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.039
 urns force staff if you bought 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.739
 force stuff on hex he doesn't give a fuck 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.840
 it is worth thinking about buying yule on 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.360
 final batches in your backpack should 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.879
 be staff hex you're not miko 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.940
 arcana and if u take that much 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:23.069
 shiva can buy what is behind her 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.650
 abilities first skill telekinesis 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.750
 the design was truly interesting because how 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.909
 only you will raise the enemy air you yourself 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.709
 specify . fallout and now 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:33.180
 think what tactics you can 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.409
 cranking but for now you think 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.780
 second skill 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.880
 faith bolt sang that will help you for 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.740
 to have a line in the truest sense of the word 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.020
 but 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.730
 sidur he creeps ravines can be very 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.560
 great farm and kill if you 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.500
 maxed out and given ability 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.110
 the third skill but the field has a good aura and 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.300
 25 spell shield antimag 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.360
 magic resistance for just 5 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.910
 more than he tilt ul but now ulta 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.220
 sang steel is the strongest 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.200
 just think of a rubik 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.130
 will be if he rolls the warlock ult or 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.110
 taydhantera 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.200
 yes he can turn everything in a jiffy 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.420
 the game of pumping the next max 1 2 skill 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.730
 on the sixth ulta and then from 8 max 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.770
 passive now and as usual I will tell 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.480
 you are the pros and cons of Rubik begin with 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.370
 the pros he is a great support can 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.470
 stand on any line if you steal 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.600
 for example , a lich's ultu can solo 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.310
 a few kilos cons they are quite 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.680
 predictable and if it is thrown at 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.270
 silence he is absolutely useless while his 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.760
 utility depends on 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:34.460
 Rubik's enemy friends peak a lot 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.950
 have grown a friend peeped all the massive enemies 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.050
 ultu hook pooja camp and ulta batrider 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.450
 ultara ulardar idared list possible 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.490
 continue endless enemies at Rubik 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.260
 it is quite quite cotton so 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.540
 many will be able to profit them 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.210
 Well, now the conclusion is true 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.100
 perfect support he you p3 their money 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.640
 can if he makes the warlock's hilka or 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.620
 trent 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.750
 it is not the complexity of the river to burn it 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.520
 will have all or a slardara and that he 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.180
 it's worth helping him run use y 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.370
 centaur 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.160
 yes and in the end he himself can not be saved 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.170
 yourself yes stand up vinegar in king or shade and 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.420
 no friends this is not your enemies will 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.070
 to help you this is a rubik saves their skills 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.660
 they will fight hysterically 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.370
 got an easy kill 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.920
 Before you leave, you should say a few 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.200
 words at least she said her steam anyway 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.030
