00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
with pulse intercom today we're going to

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.680 
with pulse intercom today we're going to
replace<00:00:05.160> a<00:00:05.490> polaris<00:00:05.940> booster<00:00:06.299> pump<00:00:06.509> motor

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690

outgoing pipes from this booster pump on

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.060 
outgoing pipes from this booster pump on
this<00:00:15.420> particular<00:00:16.020> setup<00:00:16.320> we've<00:00:16.650> got<00:00:16.920> the

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
this particular setup we've got the

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.490 
this particular setup we've got the
flexible<00:00:17.609> pipes<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.330> we<00:00:18.630> pull<00:00:18.869> back<00:00:19.080> on<00:00:19.320> this

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
flexible pipes and we pull back on this

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.710 
flexible pipes and we pull back on this
union<00:00:20.220> cause<00:00:20.430> we<00:00:20.699> have<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.939> power<00:00:21.150> off<00:00:21.480> at<00:00:21.689> the

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
union cause we have the power off at the

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.439 
union cause we have the power off at the
breaker<00:00:21.990> box<00:00:22.260> we<00:00:22.920> can<00:00:23.070> start<00:00:23.340> unwire<00:00:24.060> the

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
breaker box we can start unwire the

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.980 
breaker box we can start unwire the
electrical<00:00:25.160> this<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.430> bare<00:00:27.119> copper<00:00:27.150> wire<00:00:27.570> on

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
electrical this is a bare copper wire on

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.220 
electrical this is a bare copper wire on
the<00:00:28.080> back<00:00:28.109> is<00:00:28.500> called<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.769> bonding<00:00:29.130> wire

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
the back is called a bonding wire

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.569 
the back is called a bonding wire
secondly<00:00:31.230> we<00:00:31.349> will<00:00:31.470> remove<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.980> cover<00:00:32.189> plate

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
secondly we will remove the cover plate

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.580 
secondly we will remove the cover plate
and<00:00:32.820> now<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.300> we've<00:00:33.390> got<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.780> green<00:00:34.320> ground

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
and now that we've got the green ground

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.060 
and now that we've got the green ground
wire<00:00:35.219> removed<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:36.000> can<00:00:36.090> get<00:00:36.420> in<00:00:36.540> here<00:00:36.570> with<00:00:36.930> a

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
wire removed I can get in here with a

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:45.500 
wire removed I can get in here with a
5/16<00:00:38.070> nut<00:00:38.280> driver<00:00:38.309> remove<00:00:44.090> one<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.300> power

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
5/16 nut driver remove one of the power

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.290 
5/16 nut driver remove one of the power
leads

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:01:05.710 

in<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.079> second<00:00:52.620> power<00:00:52.829> lead

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.230 
and you'll see the shaft in there is

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.890 
and you'll see the shaft in there is
slotted<00:01:26.740> for<00:01:26.890> a<00:01:26.950> screwdriver<00:01:27.460> and<00:01:28.060> it's<00:01:28.720> also

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
slotted for a screwdriver and it's also

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.859

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.320 

you<00:01:34.869> can<00:01:35.020> also<00:01:35.170> use<00:01:35.440> a<00:01:35.470> strap<00:01:35.680> wrench<00:01:36.220> like<00:01:37.119> an

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
you can also use a strap wrench like an

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.320 
you can also use a strap wrench like an
oil<00:01:38.080> filter<00:01:38.440> wrench

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
oil filter wrench

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.240 
oil filter wrench
now<00:01:40.330> with<00:01:40.540> the<00:01:40.690> impeller<00:01:41.050> removed<00:01:41.500> we<00:01:42.220> can

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
now with the impeller removed we can

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.820 
now with the impeller removed we can
remove<00:01:42.640> the<00:01:42.850> four<00:01:43.090> bolts<00:01:43.510> here<00:01:43.990> that<00:01:44.350> secure

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830

remove the four bolts here that secure
the<00:01:45.010> bracket<00:01:45.490> into<00:01:45.850> the<00:01:45.880> motor<00:01:49.710> we<00:01:50.710> need<00:01:50.860> to

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
the bracket into the motor we need to

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.600 
the bracket into the motor we need to
bang<00:01:51.190> out<00:01:51.460> the<00:01:51.670> old<00:01:51.880> seal<00:01:52.570> the<00:01:53.020> shaft<00:01:53.560> seal<00:01:53.920> the

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
bang out the old seal the shaft seal the

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.630 
bang out the old seal the shaft seal the
number<00:01:54.880> 1000<00:01:55.630> seal<00:01:55.840> that's<00:01:56.770> in<00:01:57.100> the<00:01:57.220> bracket

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
number 1000 seal that's in the bracket

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:07.729 
number 1000 seal that's in the bracket
there<00:02:05.490> there<00:02:06.490> we<00:02:06.610> go

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:07.739 
there there we go

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:10.080 
there there we go
and<00:02:08.739> once<00:02:09.009> again<00:02:09.160> that's<00:02:09.520> a<00:02:09.610> good-looking

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
and once again that's a good-looking

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.060 
and once again that's a good-looking
impeller<00:02:10.450> not<00:02:10.750> melted<00:02:11.260> or<00:02:11.440> warped<00:02:11.920> or

deformed in any way and push it firmly
into<00:02:17.070> the<00:02:18.510> impeller<00:02:19.510> so<00:02:20.019> that's<00:02:20.290> even<00:02:21.600> second

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
into the impeller so that's even second

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.430 
into the impeller so that's even second
half<00:02:22.890> we're<00:02:23.890> going<00:02:24.190> to<00:02:24.450> press<00:02:25.450> fit<00:02:25.750> into<00:02:26.019> the

together<00:04:29.199> again<00:04:29.530> let's<00:04:29.919> go<00:04:30.130> wire<00:04:30.340> it<00:04:30.550> up<00:04:31.500> we

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
together again let's go wire it up we

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.430 
together again let's go wire it up we
took<00:04:32.680> off<00:04:32.919> this<00:04:33.210> 90<00:04:34.210> degree<00:04:34.509> conduit<00:04:34.990> fitting

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
took off this 90 degree conduit fitting

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.659 
took off this 90 degree conduit fitting
off<00:04:35.919> of<00:04:36.220> the<00:04:36.370> old<00:04:36.490> pump<00:04:37.710> motor<00:04:38.710> and<00:04:39.460> we're

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
off of the old pump motor and we're

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:41.490 
off of the old pump motor and we're
going<00:04:39.849> to<00:04:39.880> reuse<00:04:40.240> that<00:04:40.539> thread<00:04:41.050> it<00:04:41.169> into<00:04:41.349> the

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
going to reuse that thread it into the

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:53.610 
going to reuse that thread it into the
side<00:04:41.740> of<00:04:41.770> the<00:04:42.099> new<00:04:42.250> one

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.780 

like<00:04:54.100> to<00:04:54.310> wire<00:04:54.520> it<00:04:54.760> first<00:04:55.060> before<00:04:55.419> I<00:04:55.660> plumb<00:04:56.050> it

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
like to wire it first before I plumb it

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:01.110 
like to wire it first before I plumb it
so<00:04:57.790> they<00:04:57.940> have<00:04:58.120> a<00:04:58.150> little<00:04:58.360> more<00:05:00.060> movement<00:05:01.060> to

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
so they have a little more movement to

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:09.160 
so they have a little more movement to
