00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
maintenance and so forth gets more mates

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.700 
maintenance and so forth gets more mates
and<00:00:50.910> as<00:00:50.969> companies<00:00:51.360> deal<00:00:51.539> with<00:00:51.690> us<00:00:51.780> more<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.170> if

you actually take the door off what
normally<00:00:55.079> happens<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.550> this

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
normally happens is the is this is this

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.810 
normally happens is the is this is this
bearing<00:01:00.180> here<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.840> sits<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:02.489> the

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
bearing here that sits in the in the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.109 
bearing here that sits in the in the
bottom<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.019> door<00:01:04.250> gets<00:01:05.250> worn<00:01:05.489> away<00:01:05.760> or

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
bottom of the door gets worn away or

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.080 
bottom of the door gets worn away or
gets<00:01:07.049> collapsed<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.220> what<00:01:08.549> you'll<00:01:08.670> find<00:01:08.700> is

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
gets collapsed and what you'll find is

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.030 
gets collapsed and what you'll find is
that<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.390> door<00:01:09.600> starts<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.020> sink<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.650> so

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
that the door starts to sink and so

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.609 
that the door starts to sink and so
forth<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:12.000> this<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.720> actual<00:01:13.140> it's<00:01:13.320> called

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
forth so this is the actual it's called

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.560 
forth so this is the actual it's called
the<00:01:13.770> side<00:01:14.010> load<00:01:14.310> it's<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.670> eight<00:01:14.880> five<00:01:15.270> five

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
the side load it's the eight five five

out dormer side load hinge it's the

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.630 
out dormer side load hinge it's the

pivot hinge that the set underneath on
an<00:01:20.759> aluminium<00:01:20.909> door<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.439> consists<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:22.979> a

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
an aluminium door so it consists of a

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.820 
an aluminium door so it consists of a
few<00:01:23.280> components<00:01:23.700> this<00:01:24.540> is<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.930> part<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.530> you

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
few components this is the part that you

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.030 
few components this is the part that you
would<00:01:26.310> find<00:01:26.610> on<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.090> door<00:01:27.360> itself<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.229> as<00:01:28.860> you

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
found your position the right thing to

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.280 
found your position the right thing to
do<00:01:56.369> then<00:01:56.579> is<00:01:56.909> drill<00:01:57.180> yourself<00:01:57.329> this<00:01:57.780> middle

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
do then is drill yourself this middle

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.350 
do then is drill yourself this middle
hole<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:59.130> once<00:01:59.490> you've<00:01:59.670> got<00:01:59.850> it<00:01:59.880> all<00:02:00.060> set<00:02:00.329> up

take the door off and then finally fix

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.760 
take the door off and then finally fix
with<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.240> middle<00:02:03.540> hole<00:02:03.719> so<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.200> know<00:02:04.530> that

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
with that middle hole so you know that

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.190 
with that middle hole so you know that
this<00:02:04.920> isn't<00:02:05.100> going<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.430> move<00:02:05.579> again<00:02:06.020> but<00:02:07.020> what

sit on there like that alright and

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:54.259 
sit on there like that alright and
that's<00:02:53.040> nice<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.489> smooth<00:02:53.730> because<00:02:54.000> it's<00:02:54.150> all

that's nice and smooth because it's all

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.809 
that's nice and smooth because it's all
brand-new<00:02:54.660> but<00:02:55.620> you<00:02:55.799> would<00:02:55.950> then<00:02:56.160> adjust<00:02:56.579> this

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
brand-new but you would then adjust this

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.720 
brand-new but you would then adjust this
up<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:57.299> down<00:02:57.480> depending<00:02:58.109> on<00:02:58.620> how<00:02:58.890> far<00:02:59.220> you

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
up and down depending on how far you

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.970 
up and down depending on how far you
want<00:02:59.940> your<00:03:00.150> dog<00:03:00.450> to<00:03:00.480> sit<00:03:00.780> off<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:01.109> floor<00:03:01.349> so<00:03:01.890> if

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
want your dog to sit off the floor so if

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.619 
want your dog to sit off the floor so if
you've<00:03:02.099> got<00:03:02.220> a<00:03:02.280> a<00:03:02.549> sill<00:03:03.000> or<00:03:03.030> something<00:03:03.540> like

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
you've got a a sill or something like

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.000 
you've got a a sill or something like
that<00:03:03.690> then<00:03:04.079> you<00:03:04.170> may<00:03:04.379> want<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.650> set<00:03:04.829> it<00:03:04.920> up

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
that then you may want to set it up

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.369 
that then you may want to set it up
slightly<00:03:05.280> higher<00:03:05.519> it<00:03:06.450> also<00:03:06.629> comes<00:03:07.049> down<00:03:07.140> with

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
slightly higher it also comes down with

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:08.930 
slightly higher it also comes down with
this<00:03:07.530> locking<00:03:07.950> nut<00:03:08.099> and<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.340> idea<00:03:08.730> would<00:03:08.909> be

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
this locking nut and the idea would be

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.309 
this locking nut and the idea would be
is<00:03:09.299> that<00:03:09.750> you<00:03:10.290> would<00:03:10.470> pop<00:03:11.129> the<00:03:11.159> locking<00:03:11.609> nut<00:03:11.819> on

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
is that you would pop the locking nut on

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.780 
is that you would pop the locking nut on
screw<00:03:13.319> it<00:03:13.470> down<00:03:13.650> where<00:03:13.920> you<00:03:14.069> want<00:03:14.310> it<00:03:14.459> to<00:03:14.579> be

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
screw it down where you want it to be

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.240 
screw it down where you want it to be
and<00:03:15.090> then<00:03:15.810> tighten<00:03:16.230> up<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:16.440> locking<00:03:16.680> nut<00:03:17.040> and

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
and then tighten up the locking nut and

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.949 
and then tighten up the locking nut and
then<00:03:17.700> you<00:03:17.819> know<00:03:18.030> that<00:03:18.239> this<00:03:18.389> isn't<00:03:18.599> going<00:03:18.900> to

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
then you know that this isn't going to

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.440 
then you know that this isn't going to
move<00:03:19.139> so<00:03:20.069> this<00:03:20.250> is<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.489> kit<00:03:20.760> this<00:03:21.180> is<00:03:21.329> the

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
move so this is the kit this is the

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.990 
move so this is the kit this is the
