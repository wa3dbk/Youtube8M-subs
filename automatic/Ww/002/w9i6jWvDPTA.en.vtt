00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.080 
what I want to show you most of all is
that<00:00:31.920> I<00:00:32.070> really<00:00:32.399> don't<00:00:32.520> know<00:00:32.669> what<00:00:32.850> I'm<00:00:32.940> gonna

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
that I really don't know what I'm gonna

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.670 
that I really don't know what I'm gonna
do<00:00:33.270> next<00:00:33.510> when<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:33.809> start<00:00:34.079> off<00:00:34.170> these<00:00:34.320> kinds<00:00:34.620> of

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
do next when I start off these kinds of

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.069 
do next when I start off these kinds of
drawing<00:00:34.950> so<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.219> drew<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.610> thumb<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:36.899> made<00:00:37.050> a

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
drawing so I drew the thumb and I made a

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.840 
drawing so I drew the thumb and I made a
little<00:00:37.290> space<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.770> erased<00:00:38.129> so<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.579> thumb<00:00:38.760> would

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
little space I erased so the thumb would

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.430 
little space I erased so the thumb would
be<00:00:38.910> connected<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.629> then<00:00:39.840> I'd<00:00:39.960> realize<00:00:40.260> maybe

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
be connected and then I'd realize maybe

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.850 
be connected and then I'd realize maybe
I<00:00:40.559> draw<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.800> giant<00:00:41.930> looks<00:00:42.930> like<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.110> giant<00:00:43.379> ice

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
I draw a giant looks like a giant ice

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.639 
I draw a giant looks like a giant ice
cream<00:00:44.100> cone<00:00:44.340> why<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.539> don't<00:00:46.020> know<00:00:46.110> but<00:00:46.590> that's

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
cream cone why I don't know but that's

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.440 
cream cone why I don't know but that's
what<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:46.860> decided<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.250> do<00:00:47.430> so<00:00:48.120> then<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.300> keep

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
what I decided to do so then I keep

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.450 
what I decided to do so then I keep
going<00:00:48.600> with<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.200> drew<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.190> in<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.340> different

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
going with it I drew it in a different

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.459 
going with it I drew it in a different
color<00:00:50.820> so<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.059> it's<00:00:51.270> easy<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.629> then<00:00:52.110> get<00:00:52.320> rid

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
color so that it's easy to then get rid

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.660 
color so that it's easy to then get rid
of<00:00:52.590> his<00:00:52.710> green<00:00:52.980> lines<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.550> his<00:00:53.640> tongue<00:00:55.610> and<00:00:56.610> I

darker a little bit of work on the body

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:42.410 
darker a little bit of work on the body
and<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.770> arms

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.050 

and<00:01:43.409> again<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:43.890> kind<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.190> thing<00:01:44.400> I<00:01:44.640> just<00:01:44.909> go

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
and again this kind of thing I just go

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.600 
and again this kind of thing I just go
ahead<00:01:45.150> and<00:01:45.390> play<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:46.110> have<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.620> legs<00:01:47.400> be

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
ahead and play and I have the legs be

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.590 
ahead and play and I have the legs be
crazy-looking

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
crazy-looking

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.230 
crazy-looking
I<00:01:48.630> can<00:01:49.350> change<00:01:49.560> those<00:01:49.830> toes<00:01:50.070> later<00:01:50.430> or<00:01:50.700> not<00:01:50.940> I

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
I can change those toes later or not I

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.600 
I can change those toes later or not I
like<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.720> idea<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.050> a<00:01:52.140> loose<00:01:52.350> looking<00:01:53.190> cartoon

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
like the idea of a loose looking cartoon

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.310 
like the idea of a loose looking cartoon
so<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:53.940> went<00:01:54.150> ahead<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.360> put<00:01:54.630> little<00:01:54.810> pants<00:01:55.170> on

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
so I went ahead and put little pants on

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.010 
so I went ahead and put little pants on
them<00:01:55.440> and<00:01:55.619> then<00:01:56.580> only<00:01:56.760> at<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.180> point<00:01:57.479> did<00:01:57.990> I

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
them and then only at this point did I

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.950 
them and then only at this point did I
decide<00:01:58.440> well<00:01:58.680> I'll<00:01:59.130> stick<00:01:59.340> with<00:01:59.369> green<00:01:59.960> since

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
decide well I'll stick with green since

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.900 
decide well I'll stick with green since
the<00:02:01.080> outside<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.710> him<00:02:01.800> is<00:02:01.920> green<00:02:02.190> literally

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
the outside of him is green literally

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.969 
the outside of him is green literally
sometimes<00:02:03.119> that'll<00:02:03.720> determine<00:02:03.990> where

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
sometimes that'll determine where

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.609 
sometimes that'll determine where
drawing<00:02:05.340> goes<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:06.170> something<00:02:07.170> as<00:02:07.259> simple<00:02:07.409> as

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
drawing goes is something as simple as

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:07.820 
drawing goes is something as simple as
that

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
that

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.740 
that
oh<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.039> already<00:02:08.429> chose<00:02:08.700> green<00:02:09.030> for<00:02:09.300> his<00:02:09.390> outside

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
oh I already chose green for his outside

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.580 
oh I already chose green for his outside
line<00:02:10.020> well<00:02:10.830> I<00:02:10.860> guess<00:02:11.130> I'll<00:02:11.310> make<00:02:12.440> I'll<00:02:13.440> make

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
line well I guess I'll make I'll make

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.180 
line well I guess I'll make I'll make
his<00:02:13.890> entire<00:02:14.310> motif<00:02:15.200> green<00:02:16.200> I've<00:02:16.500> tried<00:02:17.070> a<00:02:17.100> few

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
his entire motif green I've tried a few

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.430 
his entire motif green I've tried a few
different<00:02:17.850> colors<00:02:18.360> for<00:02:18.570> the<00:02:18.690> pants<00:02:19.020> there<00:02:19.200> and

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
different colors for the pants there and

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.100 
different colors for the pants there and
only<00:02:20.070> at<00:02:20.190> this<00:02:20.340> point<00:02:20.580> did<00:02:20.790> I<00:02:20.880> say<00:02:21.120> ah<00:02:21.360> maybe<00:02:21.840> I

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
only at this point did I say ah maybe I

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.580 
only at this point did I say ah maybe I
will<00:02:22.230> make<00:02:22.560> him<00:02:22.800> an<00:02:23.130> alien

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
will make him an alien

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.340 
will make him an alien
since<00:02:25.590> he's<00:02:25.739> green<00:02:26.780> and<00:02:27.780> I<00:02:27.870> thought<00:02:28.050> to<00:02:28.170> myself

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
since he's green and I thought to myself

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.680 
since he's green and I thought to myself
it<00:02:28.680> would<00:02:28.769> be<00:02:28.830> fun<00:02:29.070> to<00:02:29.100> draw<00:02:29.430> him<00:02:29.610> baby<00:02:29.820> sitting

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
it would be fun to draw him baby sitting

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.990 
it would be fun to draw him baby sitting
on<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.900> counter<00:02:31.320> of<00:02:31.350> a<00:02:31.560> diner<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:32.550> I<00:02:32.790> could

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
on the counter of a diner and I could

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.320 
on the counter of a diner and I could
draw<00:02:33.209> behind<00:02:33.630> him<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:34.140> I<00:02:34.860> could<00:02:35.550> draw<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:36.180> know

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
draw behind him a I could draw you know

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.180 
draw behind him a I could draw you know
a<00:02:36.360> napkin<00:02:36.630> holder<00:02:36.989> and<00:02:37.350> stuff<00:02:37.560> like<00:02:37.709> that

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
a napkin holder and stuff like that

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.670 
a napkin holder and stuff like that
but<00:02:38.610> then<00:02:38.820> suddenly<00:02:39.030> occurred<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:39.510> me<00:02:39.780> why<00:02:40.440> not

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
but then suddenly occurred to me why not

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.640 
but then suddenly occurred to me why not
change<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:42.000> let<00:02:42.989> me<00:02:43.019> see<00:02:43.080> if<00:02:43.260> I<00:02:43.320> have<00:02:43.470> anything

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650

else<00:02:43.830> here<00:02:44.040> drawn<00:02:44.340> I<00:02:44.700> made<00:02:45.630> a<00:02:45.660> little<00:02:45.840> bit<00:02:45.959> of

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
else here drawn I made a little bit of

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.620 
else here drawn I made a little bit of
difference<00:02:46.320> in<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.470> eyes<00:02:46.650> oh<00:02:47.150> and<00:02:48.150> I<00:02:48.209> changed

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
difference in the eyes oh and I changed

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.569 
difference in the eyes oh and I changed
his<00:02:48.750> toes<00:02:48.959> here<00:02:49.290> too<00:02:49.500> I<00:02:49.739> forgot<00:02:50.070> that<00:02:50.100> I<00:02:50.250> added

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
his toes here too I forgot that I added

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.569 
his toes here too I forgot that I added
different<00:02:50.730> toes<00:02:51.709> and<00:02:52.709> it<00:02:52.860> looks<00:02:53.160> like<00:02:53.370> that's

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
different toes and it looks like that's

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.420 
different toes and it looks like that's
all<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:54.380> drawings<00:02:55.380> that<00:02:55.470> I<00:02:55.530> did<00:02:55.650> so<00:02:56.010> now<00:02:56.250> I'm

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
all the drawings that I did so now I'm

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.550 
all the drawings that I did so now I'm
actually<00:02:56.519> going<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:56.880> draw<00:02:57.090> a<00:02:57.120> live<00:02:57.480> and<00:02:57.989> I'm

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
actually going to draw a live and I'm

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.500 
actually going to draw a live and I'm
gonna<00:02:58.650> show<00:02:58.920> you<00:02:58.950> this<00:02:59.100> last<00:02:59.370> idea<00:03:00.000> that<00:03:00.180> I<00:03:00.209> had

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
gonna show you this last idea that I had

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.069 
gonna show you this last idea that I had
for<00:03:01.079> the<00:03:01.829> actual<00:03:02.430> ice-cream<00:03:03.239> so<00:03:03.420> if<00:03:03.540> he's<00:03:03.810> an

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
for the actual ice-cream so if he's an

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:08.449 
for the actual ice-cream so if he's an
alien<00:03:04.350> right<00:03:04.890> and<00:03:05.160> if<00:03:05.790> he's<00:03:07.310> visiting<00:03:08.310> our

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
alien right and if he's visiting our

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.740 
alien right and if he's visiting our
planet<00:03:08.670> and<00:03:09.150> if<00:03:09.870> he's<00:03:11.150> eating<00:03:12.150> ice<00:03:12.329> cream<00:03:12.360> I

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
planet and if he's eating ice cream I

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.500 
planet and if he's eating ice cream I
thought<00:03:12.959> well<00:03:13.110> why<00:03:13.380> not<00:03:13.410> make<00:03:14.130> it<00:03:14.450> sort<00:03:15.450> of

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
thought well why not make it sort of

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.750 
thought well why not make it sort of
like<00:03:15.660> an<00:03:15.810> earth<00:03:16.140> shaped<00:03:16.680> ice<00:03:16.950> cream<00:03:17.540> so<00:03:18.540> that

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
like an earth shaped ice cream so that

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.979 
like an earth shaped ice cream so that
I'm<00:03:20.760> gonna<00:03:20.850> use<00:03:21.090> a<00:03:21.120> tool<00:03:21.450> here<00:03:21.720> where<00:03:21.900> you

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
I'm gonna use a tool here where you

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.560 
I'm gonna use a tool here where you
paint<00:03:22.230> inside<00:03:22.799> so<00:03:23.489> when<00:03:23.640> I<00:03:23.670> paint<00:03:23.850> inside<00:03:24.269> like

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
paint inside so when I paint inside like

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.039 
paint inside so when I paint inside like
that<00:03:25.579> it'll<00:03:26.579> only<00:03:26.910> paint<00:03:27.120> inside<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.600> blue<00:03:27.780> I

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
that it'll only paint inside the blue I

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.350 
that it'll only paint inside the blue I
hope<00:03:28.200> that<00:03:28.380> makes<00:03:28.530> sense<00:03:28.790> so<00:03:29.790> then<00:03:29.940> I<00:03:29.970> decided

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
hope that makes sense so then I decided

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.030 
hope that makes sense so then I decided
well<00:03:30.480> why<00:03:30.720> not<00:03:30.900> have<00:03:31.079> the<00:03:31.200> ice<00:03:31.350> cream<00:03:31.380> be<00:03:31.860> like

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
well why not have the ice cream be like

this is how I do a I'll try them one

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.740 
this is how I do a I'll try them one
more<00:03:59.040> version<00:03:59.340> of<00:03:59.430> that<00:03:59.550> sorry<00:04:01.010> this<00:04:02.010> is<00:04:02.190> how<00:04:02.310> I

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
more version of that sorry this is how I

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.710 
more version of that sorry this is how I
make<00:04:03.750> my<00:04:03.780> quick<00:04:04.200> United<00:04:04.650> States<00:04:04.950> look<00:04:05.660> after<00:04:06.660> a

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
make my quick United States look after a

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.350 
make my quick United States look after a
while<00:04:06.900> it<00:04:07.230> begins<00:04:07.650> to<00:04:07.920> take<00:04:08.700> form<00:04:08.760> and<00:04:09.240> take

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
while it begins to take form and take

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.710 
while it begins to take form and take
shape<00:04:10.760> so<00:04:11.760> I'm<00:04:11.820> not<00:04:11.970> really<00:04:12.150> happy<00:04:12.420> with<00:04:12.540> the

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
shape so I'm not really happy with the

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.570 
shape so I'm not really happy with the
way<00:04:12.840> the<00:04:12.990> America<00:04:13.470> looks<00:04:13.680> there<00:04:13.920> and<00:04:14.130> Canada

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
way the America looks there and Canada

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
way the America looks there and Canada

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
so I'm going to sort of do a little

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.880 
so I'm going to sort of do a little
changing<00:04:15.990> around<00:04:16.080> here<00:04:16.350> and<00:04:16.620> I<00:04:16.650> might<00:04:16.799> even

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
changing around here and I might even

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.650 
changing around here and I might even
change<00:04:17.130> around<00:04:17.370> the<00:04:17.459> whole<00:04:17.640> top<00:04:17.880> of<00:04:17.910> it<00:04:18.150> why

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
change around the whole top of it why

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.350 
change around the whole top of it why
not<00:04:18.690> right<00:04:19.400> now<00:04:20.400> that<00:04:20.549> I've<00:04:20.640> gotten<00:04:20.910> my<00:04:21.000> idea

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:21.360 
not right now that I've gotten my idea

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
fit the idea first I start drawing then

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.970 
fit the idea first I start drawing then
I<00:04:27.240> get<00:04:27.450> the<00:04:27.570> idea<00:04:27.840> that<00:04:27.900> I<00:04:28.110> change<00:04:28.410> it<00:04:28.620> so<00:04:28.830> now

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.370 
actually take away in my opinion from

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:09.320 
actually take away in my opinion from
the<00:06:08.669> activity

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
the activity

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.559 
the activity
going<00:06:09.689> on<00:06:09.840> in<00:06:10.340> the<00:06:11.340> earth<00:06:11.550> drawing<00:06:11.970> so<00:06:12.270> either

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:12.569 
going on in the earth drawing so either

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:15.140 
going on in the earth drawing so either
I<00:06:12.780> would<00:06:13.139> lighten<00:06:13.979> up<00:06:14.159> the<00:06:14.460> spots<00:06:14.849> or

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.150 
I would lighten up the spots or

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.270 
I would lighten up the spots or
completely<00:06:15.659> take<00:06:15.960> them<00:06:16.139> away<00:06:16.349> that<00:06:16.979> being

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 
completely take them away that being

completely take them away that being
said<00:06:17.550> I'm<00:06:17.789> going<00:06:18.060> to<00:06:18.120> try<00:06:18.270> taking<00:06:18.629> them<00:06:18.719> away<00:06:18.840> I

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 
said I'm going to try taking them away I

like it better without the spots and
these<00:06:22.020> are<00:06:22.110> the<00:06:22.199> kinds<00:06:22.439> of<00:06:22.469> choices<00:06:22.919> that<00:06:22.949> I

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.310 
these are the kinds of choices that I

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.209 
these are the kinds of choices that I
make<00:06:23.849> I<00:06:24.210> have<00:06:24.449> to<00:06:24.659> make<00:06:24.870> I<00:06:25.229> go<00:06:25.770> ahead<00:06:25.889> with<00:06:26.039> a

00:06:26.209 --> 00:06:26.219 
make I have to make I go ahead with a

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:28.670 
make I have to make I go ahead with a
drawing<00:06:26.580> I<00:06:26.819> do<00:06:26.879> something<00:06:27.509> and<00:06:27.719> then<00:06:28.379> I<00:06:28.469> take

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 
drawing I do something and then I take

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.529 
drawing I do something and then I take
away<00:06:28.919> and<00:06:29.219> then<00:06:29.310> I<00:06:29.340> add<00:06:29.610> and<00:06:30.090> that's<00:06:30.360> the

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:30.539 
away and then I add and that's the

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:32.059 
away and then I add and that's the
process<00:06:30.900> I<00:06:30.990> go<00:06:31.139> through<00:06:31.169> and<00:06:31.620> if<00:06:31.919> you're

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:32.069 
process I go through and if you're

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:33.890 
process I go through and if you're
drawing<00:06:32.340> too<00:06:32.610> you<00:06:33.030> can<00:06:33.210> do<00:06:33.330> that<00:06:33.449> too<00:06:33.629> you<00:06:33.780> can

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:33.900 
drawing too you can do that too you can

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.149 
drawing too you can do that too you can
change<00:06:34.169> your<00:06:34.349> mind<00:06:34.530> you<00:06:34.710> can<00:06:34.740> go<00:06:34.979> in<00:06:35.099> a

00:06:35.149 --> 00:06:35.159 
change your mind you can go in a

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:36.740 
change your mind you can go in a
particular<00:06:35.400> direction<00:06:35.729> and<00:06:36.150> especially<00:06:36.629> with

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:36.750 
particular direction and especially with

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.320 
particular direction and especially with
computers<00:06:37.259> whoops<00:06:37.889> didn't<00:06:38.669> mean<00:06:38.759> to<00:06:38.849> do<00:06:38.939> that

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330 
computers whoops didn't mean to do that

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.040 
computers whoops didn't mean to do that
behind<00:06:39.719> him<00:06:39.960> I'm<00:06:40.080> going<00:06:40.289> to<00:06:40.379> draw<00:06:41.750> some<00:06:42.750> ground

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.050 
behind him I'm going to draw some ground

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.260 
behind him I'm going to draw some ground
now<00:06:43.530> this<00:06:43.740> could<00:06:43.860> be<00:06:43.949> like<00:06:44.069> space<00:06:44.430> ground<00:06:44.879> or

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:45.270 
now this could be like space ground or

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.959 
now this could be like space ground or
another<00:06:46.139> planet<00:06:46.469> ground<00:06:46.919> see<00:06:47.490> how<00:06:47.610> I'm<00:06:47.699> making

00:06:47.959 --> 00:06:47.969 
another planet ground see how I'm making

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:49.040 
another planet ground see how I'm making
a<00:06:48.030> choice<00:06:48.180> right<00:06:48.449> here<00:06:48.569> I<00:06:48.629> don't<00:06:48.870> know<00:06:48.930> what

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.050 
a choice right here I don't know what

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:50.420 
a choice right here I don't know what
I'm<00:06:49.139> doing<00:06:49.409> I'm<00:06:49.560> just<00:06:49.590> moving<00:06:49.949> it<00:06:50.009> around<00:06:50.099> I'm

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:50.430 
I'm doing I'm just moving it around I'm

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:52.459 
I'm doing I'm just moving it around I'm
looking<00:06:50.580> to<00:06:50.789> see<00:06:50.969> what<00:06:51.120> works<00:06:51.330> best<00:06:51.659> so<00:06:51.990> I'm

00:06:52.459 --> 00:06:52.469 
looking to see what works best so I'm

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:54.279 
looking to see what works best so I'm
trying<00:06:52.710> to<00:06:52.740> find<00:06:52.860> a<00:06:53.009> place<00:06:53.250> where<00:06:53.460> the<00:06:53.580> land

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:54.289 
trying to find a place where the land

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:57.439 
trying to find a place where the land
doesn't<00:06:55.289> cut<00:06:55.620> across<00:06:55.919> his<00:06:56.190> toes<00:06:56.520> or<00:06:57.060> his<00:06:57.240> elbow

00:06:57.439 --> 00:06:57.449 
doesn't cut across his toes or his elbow

00:06:57.449 --> 00:06:59.330 
doesn't cut across his toes or his elbow
you<00:06:57.750> don't<00:06:58.020> want<00:06:58.199> the<00:06:58.409> land<00:06:58.650> to<00:06:58.830> do<00:06:58.979> something

00:06:59.330 --> 00:06:59.340 
you don't want the land to do something

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:00.469 
you don't want the land to do something
like<00:06:59.430> this<00:06:59.639> you<00:06:59.789> see<00:06:59.909> the<00:07:00.030> way<00:07:00.120> it's<00:07:00.240> right<00:07:00.330> on

00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:00.479 
like this you see the way it's right on
