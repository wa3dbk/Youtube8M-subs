00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:03.530
 starts 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.110
 what's up youtube and welcome 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.580
 to another video main channel yes 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.900
 Today you see in the background of wild 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.900
 of light again a gameplay and 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.700
 two nephews demo on lockdown dvd 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.529
 doing so with extended magazine and 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.400
 Muffler is really nasty the weapon 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.630
 so you you must definitely times 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.550
 especially now after the patch play 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.320
 In any case highly recommended that 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.580
 Things are so violent, so you guys 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.220
 it must be real that a secret much 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.540
 weapon many people know the weapons 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.460
 weapon is not right but it is 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.460
 In any case, really cool thing and 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.260
 I wish you so much so much fun 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.399
 today's theme is the gaming 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.930
 industry I already have a lot over 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:51.579
 reallife and something talked but then 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.809
 I thought come today brings the 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:54.910
 People do what they want 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.950
 Although information about the gaming world 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.600
 simply because we are here 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.280
 A portal became a gameplay background 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.629
 you only know maybe you come 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.039
 that somehow strange and of 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.649
 so it's a bit about that today 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.869
 gaming became aware of it 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:10.509
 I stood by my time 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:12.160
 Articles from the gamescom where about the 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.680
 The topic is now going to be the same 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.509
 and that's about it that pc games in 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.770
 next time probably free 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.500
 can be offered 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.479
 this is a service that the pc and 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.670
 in general, the game industry came up 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.590
 this is what it is 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.049
 that the games for free at the 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.880
 go consumer and then money for 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.159
 must pay monthly or objects 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.930
 then I have one before and one disadvantage 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.460
 always set up you look what then 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.080
 so good at it and not so good 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.640
 So benefits are definitely 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.470
 first then everyone can play 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.320
 then people with little money can be quite easy 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.869
 gamble because there are , so to speak, none 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.070
 Obligation must be that you have to if it is 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.880
 now is not exactly monthly though 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.500
 here for example money for 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.060
 paid for things such as runes of 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.409
 magic is falling here and i would have 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.150
 it sort of wow clone 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.680
 that means that you just moved there 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.350
 No money to pay but then 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.909
 stop synonymous while downloading nothing but 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.090
 then for the objects that is 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.200
 Everyone can play and the developers can 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.579
 this game also tried more because 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.470
 The production is much cheaper 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:10.899
 she does not have to be the ultimate 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.519
 great game right in the final version 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.110
 but can do it all 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.070
 clarify with patches because in the beginning must 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.090
 not players be so great 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.500
 Consumers finally nothing for it 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.390
 accordingly, it can pay 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.739
 do not complain either 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.390
 this model for the extremely good for 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.340
 opportunity 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.050
 player because if you did not pull so often 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.060
 then, no matter how good 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.340
 you are in this game because you have 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.940
 just fun to gamble it just a 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.080
 few hours of cinema mode back deluxe one 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.970
 to gamble a bit or just to 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.080
 what 's the matter that it does not matter that 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.459
 one does not have the best object if 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.020
 you just get on your mouth then you get excited 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.330
 is not even on the next day 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.190
 again so now I have the 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.470
 disadvantages and that is quite 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.940
 clearly the big disadvantage is the other 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.320
 game what we say for example buy 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.600
 do you want to buy warfare 3 in the store 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.190
 now cost one to 50 euros for PS3 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.540
 bought a house you have it too you have to 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.730
 then nothing if he is currently out of you 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.250
 Do you buy what it means that means that 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.500
 you just practically from the feeling 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.570
 you never pay again what the money 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.190
 away and then you have plays there so have 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.900
 but then you get the game for free 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.190
 and then has to pay monthly for it 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.959
 of course every month again so ne 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.280
 ask if it has until this month 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.150
 enough bock enough this month 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.950
 to pay again 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.000
 I find such a clause quite well 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.320
 if you could decide that way 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.180
 which world you pay for and which one 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.410
 but skip that is 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.720
 Of course, probably from hitler too 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.300
 different developers yes then yes 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.560
 of course, the greatest of all 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.280
 problem that the success then commercially 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.890
 becomes 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.780
 please before there would be in mw3 one 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.510
 super-weapon aside from the impulsive 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.670
 which you could buy for 65 euros 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.220
 The weapon would then have a firing rate 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.870
 the p90 m1 have and hurt like the msr 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.519
 that means the most delicious one 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.170
 shot or two shots death so rather 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.769
 it can not do anything at all 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.850
 Of course, precision is of the shareholder 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.560
 that is, then someone would 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.079
 think if the five euro paid while 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.400
 always have this way and that for every game 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.900
 we already have the problem because the 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.700
 people do not pay then one 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.430
 extremely disadvantageous that it is this 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.709
 typical free to play to system 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.760
 is called grades to play but it will 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.890
 really expensive if you want to win 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.930
 then someday all people say oh i 25 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.190
 euro for the ultra weapon and at the end 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.510
 did you think that was such a game 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.160
 somehow just the people the one 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.049
 have some money on the bank 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.940
 five why many people really a lot 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.079
 money what you say so five euros 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.820
 especially because many are not over 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.590
 Wise and credit card and everything 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.700
 have because you have really look out the 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.930
 then at all in Christ one 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.210
 maybe with paysafecard or something 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.790
 rules mean something to a super army 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.350
 this csl gamer and all that 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.840
 then all of a sudden really in this one 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.430
 weapon gamble and no chance and on 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.840
 best still extra by casting euro 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.000
 it would cost him 50 percent 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.500
 less cartridges gets hurt itself 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.730
 So that you then say honestly 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.530
 would have to kill with three shots 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.060
 then kill himself with six shots so 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.890
 such an extreme unfairness into the game 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.630
 would be and therefore it is actually 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.000
 a development in the case 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.590
 not so favor 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.760
 at least not for the sale of the 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.050
 Successor for sometime say that 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.670
 the people then god two too 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.140
 bad that all the people as their 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.550
 have spent money for and then so 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.210
 that's why they were good at buying 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.220
 not again 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.590
 So that's why you have to be right 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.120
 as a developer then just think so 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.480
 In any case, it will be one of those 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.920
 kind 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.450
 I think I'm definitely one 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.980
 addiction for people who play it yes 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.900
 can not buy because like the same time 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.880
 That's out if you do not mind the game 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.990
 but the extra items the 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.580
 equal band that one against 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.360
 can not buy exactly you had to 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.490
 earn 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.170
 and then these objects become too 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.000
 you have to pull extremely long pulled and 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.680
 that means that they play extremely well 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.580
 people again so extremely long before that 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.560
 have to sit 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.460
 maybe school et cetera van like 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.260
 because they just do not have that much money 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.640
 to have 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:32.160
 accordingly, the whole system is in 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.090
 Principle bad for core-gamer core 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.950
 Gamers are really the players 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.540
 every day x the console fire up a 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.160
 some rounds of gambling or certain of these 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:42.540
 are really looking for in each 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:44.760
 play only mw3 match therefore the 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.380
 game system what we have planned in case 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.460
 that gives this free to play is up 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.080
 definitely one could describe it as 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.850
 It is good for casual players and 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.920
 bad for core gamer because it's in 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.930
 In this case just really the 

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.630
 interests just completely different 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.310
 For sale the opportunist 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.840
 he is interested i am playing now 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.370
 a little bit fun, I need it 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.990
 the items are not the core gamer 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.880
 says i have a good kg after that 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.590
 So have bought the pp 90m one 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.000
 Ultra weapon and then they have too 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.590
 again exactly what is playing in the 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.470
 The industry is actually only going 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.540
 it's just about money 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.880
 a rip-off industry and that's why 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.680
 So this system as a conclusion of mine 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.570
 then that ends up pulling this system 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.130
 I think I'm really stupid 

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:24.210
 please see the comments as it finds 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.410
 that all computer games or 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:28.290
 or playstation games 

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:30.390
 to be free because I think so 

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:31.860
 really shit because you every 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.390
 say month if you paid that is 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.320
 I have to return to the ten every month 

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:35.760
 shell out 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.040
 and then it does not help the game on 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.409
 In the beginning I was thankful for that 

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.639
 you gazed up to here 

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:42.139
 as I said write me the comments 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:43.219
 how you find that you can do me too 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:44.479
 let it be easier if it is you 

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:46.550
 I celebrated that from the gaming 

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:50.379
 I talked about something in the industry 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:50.379
