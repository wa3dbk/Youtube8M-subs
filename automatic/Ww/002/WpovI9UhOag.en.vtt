00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:07.799
 my rain or hanging already 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:19.140
 look at something that is something but something 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:23.029
 it is not clear there is dragon 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:27.289
 again our dangerous draco 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.289
 yes now 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:47.880
 I took well, so do not take it very much 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:51.830
 that it is a very dangerous dragon fish 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:56.070
 it means she has three or four thorns on top 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:58.680
 these thorns are very poisonous 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.610
 if at the well it's not even there 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.230
 nasty not only that pain right up 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.350
 what can install 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:09.960
 a hand there or a place which was which 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.680
 injected is still a very dangerous place a lot 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.380
 about many forget about it 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.060
 is he is not looking for one step 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.190
 clicking on the gill covers 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.040
 These are the ones myself, as it were, on top 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.840
 it is difficult to have someone here for the here and thorns 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.490
 when he starts to beat twitch 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.090
 let's say you want to take it and take it off 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.220
 hook 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.340
 here it is just such here these thorns 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.040
 on the gill cover it is ordinary 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.650
 comics from only when gestures and Dmitrov and 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.240
 immediately puts something out when 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.380
 dangling on a hook and 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.490
 with a thorn usually always people to face with 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:49.100
 this fish needs to be very careful 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:50.979
 contact let's release more such 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.910
 such a kid 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:58.520
 But if we have vodka there are already local 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.470
 fishermen who basically know how 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.399
 handle your be better ask them 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:08.090
 I am very often people who never to her 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:09.020
 didn't see don't know what fish often 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.070
 injected 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:15.500
 and she pecks very interestingly let's say I 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.170
 I make a cast just missed 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.560
 literally some time there are two seconds 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.570
 three bait lay on the bottom and all early 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.630
 and and picks up and the client lives in the sand 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.970
 and right in the sand buries here of course 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.560
 if on the underwater shoot and 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.780
 underwater songs 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.630
 she is 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.290
 he has such a beautiful paint 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.469
 beautiful fish itself beautiful 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.790
 live bit now i will try 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:46.230
 grab something 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:59.329
 probably we need to go all the same 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:59.329
 under the shore something we have fluid 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.019
 Yes, it looks like a dragon 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:21.970
 see and we became 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:27.019
 somewhere around the sand and yes such a dragon 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:29.049
 to bigger here probably not anymore 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:37.459
 do without 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:40.110
 such a string of tons is dangerous for such 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:48.930
 cases you need to always have a tool 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:50.760
 similar as always the most interesting 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.580
 moment we have phone conversations 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:57.620
 is scheduled 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.620
 wait quiet quiet quiet quiet quiet quiet 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.780
 maybe of course a professional from not 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.780
 understands much faster but 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.030
 tours 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:22.769
 all let's go shore here nothing to do 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.769
 here they bite one another for
