00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
USB ports on your computer just by

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.460 
USB ports on your computer just by
linking<00:01:28.860> them<00:01:29.009> together

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
linking them together

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.160 
linking them together
it<00:01:31.470> basically<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:33.000> compact<00:01:33.509> accessible

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
it basically is a compact accessible

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.929 
it basically is a compact accessible
unit<00:01:34.729> but<00:01:35.729> it's<00:01:35.850> got<00:01:36.030> total<00:01:36.900> kill<00:01:37.140> EQ<00:01:38.100> isolator

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
unit but it's got total kill EQ isolator

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.210 
unit but it's got total kill EQ isolator
you've<00:01:39.630> got<00:01:39.840> effect<00:01:40.380> loop<00:01:40.619> at<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.799> back<00:01:40.979> with

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
you've got effect loop at the back with

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.740 
you've got effect loop at the back with
send<00:01:41.430> them<00:01:41.549> return<00:01:41.820> connections<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.570> can

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
send them return connections so you can

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.179 
send them return connections so you can
expand<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.320> set<00:01:43.500> up<00:01:43.680> it's<00:01:43.829> not<00:01:43.950> like<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.159> are

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
expand the set up it's not like you are

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.389 
expand the set up it's not like you are
just<00:01:44.460> stuck<00:01:44.640> with<00:01:45.740> the<00:01:46.740> mix<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.070> you've<00:01:47.159> got

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
just stuck with the mix that you've got

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.999 
just stuck with the mix that you've got
you've<00:01:48.149> got<00:01:48.180> dual<00:01:48.630> phono<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.590> line<00:01:49.770> level

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
you've got dual phono and line level

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.219 
you've got dual phono and line level
inputs<00:01:50.460> at<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.700> top<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.210> it's<00:01:51.600> actually<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.869> 2+2

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
inputs at the top so it's actually a 2+2

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.230 
inputs at the top so it's actually a 2+2
mixer<00:01:52.680> so<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:52.890> could<00:01:53.159> actually<00:01:53.340> be<00:01:53.939> mixing

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
mixer so you could actually be mixing

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.260 
mixer so you could actually be mixing
between<00:01:54.360> those<00:01:55.200> two<00:01:55.380> sources<00:01:55.740> per<00:01:55.979> channel<00:01:56.280> as

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
between those two sources per channel as

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.830 
between those two sources per channel as
well

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
well

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.039
