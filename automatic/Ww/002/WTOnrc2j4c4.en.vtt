00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
as I mentioned earlier you know you can

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.879 
as I mentioned earlier you know you can
go<00:02:56.730> with<00:02:57.000> just<00:02:57.150> water<00:02:57.329> cooling<00:02:57.750> it<00:02:57.840> CPU<00:02:58.319> so<00:02:58.739> if

00:02:58.879 --> 00:02:58.889 
go with just water cooling it CPU so if

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:00.620 
go with just water cooling it CPU so if
you're<00:02:59.010> gonna<00:02:59.100> like<00:02:59.250> 70<00:02:59.730> overclock<00:03:00.269> little

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
you're gonna like 70 overclock little

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.240 
you're gonna like 70 overclock little
more<00:03:00.780> than<00:03:00.900> what<00:03:00.989> you<00:03:01.019> can<00:03:01.230> already<00:03:01.410> buy<00:03:02.220> a

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
more than what you can already buy a

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.270 
more than what you can already buy a

whatever<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.090> cell<00:03:06.269> can<00:03:06.299> these<00:03:06.569> days<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.079> I

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
whatever the cell can these days and I

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.099 
whatever the cell can these days and I
think<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:07.980> cost<00:03:08.190> of<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.370> hitch<00:03:08.840> 110<00:03:09.840> is<00:03:09.959> the

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
think the cost of the hitch 110 is the

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:12.229 
think the cost of the hitch 110 is the
newest<00:03:10.500> one<00:03:10.530> they<00:03:10.739> do<00:03:10.889> but<00:03:11.069> you<00:03:11.579> know<00:03:11.700> this<00:03:11.970> all

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
content as safe as i said about yeah

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.849 
content as safe as i said about yeah
they're<00:03:15.090> cheap<00:03:15.329> real<00:03:15.750> cheap<00:03:15.780> and<00:03:16.230> you<00:03:16.709> can

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
they're cheap real cheap and you can

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.069 
they're cheap real cheap and you can
overclock<00:03:17.280> air<00:03:18.000> you<00:03:18.209> know<00:03:18.299> you<00:03:18.359> cpu<00:03:18.840> very

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
overclock air you know you cpu very

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.440 
overclock air you know you cpu very
nicely<00:03:19.260> right<00:03:19.470> then<00:03:19.650> and<00:03:20.000> yeah<00:03:21.000> I<00:03:21.030> suppose<00:03:21.359> you

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
nicely right then and yeah I suppose you

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.580 
nicely right then and yeah I suppose you
can<00:03:21.569> kind<00:03:21.750> of<00:03:21.780> see<00:03:21.930> what<00:03:22.079> a<00:03:22.109> water-cooled

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
can kind of see what a water-cooled

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.710 
can kind of see what a water-cooled
system<00:03:22.919> because<00:03:23.220> you<00:03:23.310> have<00:03:23.489> but<00:03:23.819> ended<00:03:24.120> e<00:03:24.209> at

no<00:03:25.829> hassle<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.280> sell<00:03:26.549> them<00:03:26.669> at<00:03:26.730> up<00:03:26.819> at<00:03:26.940> all<00:03:27.060> it's

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
no hassle to sell them at up at all it's

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.750 
no hassle to sell them at up at all it's
really<00:03:27.750> simple<00:03:27.989> to<00:03:28.139> set<00:03:28.410> up<00:03:28.440> now<00:03:29.130> and<00:03:29.430> then

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
really simple to set up now and then

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.580 
really simple to set up now and then
with<00:03:29.880> two<00:03:30.030> games<00:03:30.239> it's<00:03:30.630> you<00:03:30.930> need<00:03:31.169> more<00:03:31.530> than

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
with two games it's you need more than

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:32.960 
with two games it's you need more than
one<00:03:31.980> pump<00:03:32.310> if<00:03:32.459> you've<00:03:32.579> got<00:03:32.669> loads<00:03:32.819> of

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
one pump if you've got loads of

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.240 
one pump if you've got loads of

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.409 
CPUs now from what I know guys you do
not<00:03:39.269> need<00:03:39.450> more<00:03:39.870> than<00:03:39.900> one<00:03:40.230> pump<00:03:40.470> and<00:03:40.620> I<00:03:41.419> you

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:42.419 
not need more than one pump and I you

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:44.390 
not need more than one pump and I you

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.220 
know typically you know some people
might<00:03:44.519> need<00:03:44.730> two<00:03:44.910> pumps<00:03:45.239> if<00:03:45.419> the<00:03:45.720> thinking<00:03:46.079> of

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
might need two pumps if the thinking of

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.159 
might need two pumps if the thinking of
overclocking<00:03:46.799> and<00:03:47.310> you<00:03:48.030> know<00:03:48.120> graphic<00:03:48.599> cards

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:49.169 
overclocking and you know graphic cards

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:51.229 
overclocking and you know graphic cards
not<00:03:49.500> many<00:03:49.709> graph<00:03:50.040> cards<00:03:50.430> so<00:03:50.609> they<00:03:50.639> do<00:03:51.060> a<00:03:51.090> lot

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
not many graph cards so they do a lot

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
cpu and see if two or three GPUs you

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.530 
cpu and see if two or three GPUs you
only<00:04:28.040> need<00:04:28.280> one<00:04:28.490> pump<00:04:28.700> now<00:04:28.850> you<00:04:29.090> really<00:04:29.240> do<00:04:29.389> not

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
only need one pump now you really do not

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.810 
only need one pump now you really do not
need<00:04:29.750> to<00:04:30.020> at<00:04:30.169> all<00:04:30.320> and<00:04:30.590> two<00:04:31.310> pumps<00:04:31.580> are<00:04:31.669> just

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
need to at all and two pumps are just

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.290 
need to at all and two pumps are just
for<00:04:32.090> the<00:04:32.180> ragging<00:04:32.870> lights<00:04:33.080> or<00:04:33.320> maybe<00:04:34.300> maybe

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
for the ragging lights or maybe maybe

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.770 
for the ragging lights or maybe maybe
you<00:04:35.510> want<00:04:35.750> to<00:04:36.700> just<00:04:37.700> get<00:04:37.820> soon<00:04:38.060> very<00:04:38.360> quiet

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
you want to just get soon very quiet

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.290 
you want to just get soon very quiet
pumps<00:04:39.110> ready<00:04:39.320> maybe<00:04:39.770> here<00:04:39.979> now<00:04:40.580> this<00:04:41.120> is

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
pumps ready maybe here now this is

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.960 
pumps ready maybe here now this is
moving<00:04:41.630> us<00:04:41.900> on<00:04:42.050> to<00:04:42.320> number<00:04:42.470> one<00:04:42.830> and<00:04:43.130> all<00:04:43.700> you

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
moving us on to number one and all you

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.300 
moving us on to number one and all you
guys<00:04:44.180> think<00:04:44.690> that<00:04:44.780> you<00:04:45.050> need<00:04:45.290> and<00:04:45.560> you<00:04:45.590> know

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
guys think that you need and you know

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.430 
guys think that you need and you know
you<00:04:46.610> need<00:04:46.790> to<00:04:46.910> pump<00:04:47.150> that<00:04:47.419> runs<00:04:47.720> at<00:04:47.930> a<00:04:47.960> fast

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
you need to pump that runs at a fast

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.550 
you need to pump that runs at a fast
rate<00:04:48.740> now<00:04:49.460> a<00:04:49.780> lot<00:04:50.780> of<00:04:50.870> you<00:04:50.930> guys<00:04:50.990> are<00:04:51.320> thinking

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
rate now a lot of you guys are thinking

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.040 
rate now a lot of you guys are thinking
of<00:04:51.740> the<00:04:51.860> faster<00:04:52.280> waters<00:04:52.639> flowing<00:04:52.910> so<00:04:53.780> it<00:04:53.870> ends

it's<00:05:17.960> what<00:05:18.169> was<00:05:18.289> in<00:05:18.470> your<00:05:18.500> ad<00:05:18.830> and<00:05:19.130> you<00:05:19.580> know<00:05:19.669> a

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
it's what was in your ad and you know a

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.610 
it's what was in your ad and you know a
lower<00:05:20.060> amount<00:05:20.180> of<00:05:20.510> time<00:05:20.720> you<00:05:21.289> are<00:05:21.440> basically

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
lower amount of time you are basically

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.310 
lower amount of time you are basically

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:27.229 
if that makes sense to you guys so you

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:29.110 
if that makes sense to you guys so you
pump<00:05:27.530> doesn't<00:05:27.950> need<00:05:28.190> to<00:05:28.280> be<00:05:28.340> running<00:05:28.520> a<00:05:28.760> real

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
quite a lot you guys like oh yeah water

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.480 
quite a lot you guys like oh yeah water
cooling<00:05:33.139> is<00:05:33.260> not<00:05:33.380> good<00:05:33.650> increase<00:05:34.100> the<00:05:34.280> speed

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
cooling is not good increase the speed

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.520 
cooling is not good increase the speed
no<00:05:34.940> you<00:05:35.419> do<00:05:35.510> not<00:05:35.539> increase<00:05:35.840> the<00:05:36.050> speed<00:05:36.260> at<00:05:36.380> all

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
no you do not increase the speed at all

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.400 
no you do not increase the speed at all
and<00:05:36.789> a<00:05:37.789> good<00:05:38.270> way<00:05:38.419> to<00:05:38.479> get<00:05:38.660> my<00:05:38.780> performance<00:05:39.229> is

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
and a good way to get my performance is

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.770 
and a good way to get my performance is
to<00:05:39.590> add<00:05:39.710> more<00:05:39.950> radiators<00:05:40.550> or<00:05:40.729> more<00:05:41.060> fans<00:05:41.419> if

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780 
to add more radiators or more fans if

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.230 
to add more radiators or more fans if
you<00:05:42.289> are<00:05:42.410> really<00:05:42.560> it<00:05:42.740> is<00:05:42.860> where<00:05:43.130> wave<00:05:43.729> a<00:05:43.970> pull

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
you are really it is where wave a pull

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.870 
you are really it is where wave a pull
or<00:05:44.510> push<00:05:44.780> configuration<00:05:45.620> put<00:05:46.070> both<00:05:46.280> have<00:05:46.849> a

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
or push configuration put both have a

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.430 
or push configuration put both have a
rad<00:05:47.120> have<00:05:47.330> fans<00:05:47.570> on<00:05:47.720> both<00:05:47.870> side<00:05:48.110> and<00:05:48.289> have<00:05:48.410> a

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
rad have fans on both side and have a

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.589 
rad have fans on both side and have a
push-pull<00:05:48.950> configuration<00:05:49.180> so<00:05:50.180> more<00:05:50.360> fans

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:50.599 
push-pull configuration so more fans

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:52.029 
push-pull configuration so more fans
you've<00:05:50.780> gotten<00:05:51.050> the<00:05:51.139> more<00:05:51.289> radius<00:05:51.740> base

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:52.039 
you've gotten the more radius base

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:53.950 
you've gotten the more radius base
you've<00:05:52.190> kind<00:05:52.400> of<00:05:52.460> got<00:05:52.610> you<00:05:53.150> know<00:05:53.270> just<00:05:53.660> sure

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 
you've kind of got you know just sure

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.900 
you've kind of got you know just sure
more<00:05:54.169> idiot<00:05:54.470> is<00:05:54.560> in<00:05:54.710> my<00:05:55.130> fans<00:05:55.430> and<00:05:55.669> that's

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:55.910 
more idiot is in my fans and that's

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.100 
more idiot is in my fans and that's
where<00:05:56.240> you're<00:05:56.720> going<00:05:56.840> to<00:05:56.900> get<00:05:56.960> more

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
where you're going to get more

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.020 
where you're going to get more
performance<00:05:57.260> because<00:05:57.919> the<00:05:58.070> water<00:05:58.280> is<00:05:58.460> able<00:05:58.910> to

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.030 
performance because the water is able to

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.540 
performance because the water is able to
cool<00:05:59.300> and<00:05:59.570> therefore<00:06:00.470> that's<00:06:00.650> gonna<00:06:00.950> add<00:06:01.190> you
