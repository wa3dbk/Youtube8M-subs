the brain storms necessary to move and
we<00:01:36.530> had<00:01:36.680> a<00:01:36.710> humanoid<00:01:37.250> robot<00:01:37.310> in<00:01:38.030> Kyoto<00:01:38.780> Japan

grandmother used to say the impossible

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.830 
grandmother used to say the impossible
is<00:02:51.860> just<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.370> possible<00:02:52.910> that<00:02:53.269> someone<00:02:53.660> has

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
is just the possible that someone has

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.930 
is just the possible that someone has
just<00:02:53.870> not<00:02:54.260> put<00:02:54.470> enough<00:02:54.739> effort<00:02:54.980> into<00:02:55.519> to<00:02:55.820> make

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
just not put enough effort into to make

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.840 
just not put enough effort into to make
it<00:02:56.150> come<00:02:56.359> true<00:02:56.660> so<00:02:57.530> they<00:02:57.560> told<00:02:57.769> me<00:02:58.280> that<00:02:58.670> it<00:02:58.820> is

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
it come true so they told me that it is

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.990 
it come true so they told me that it is
impossible<00:02:59.600> to<00:02:59.750> make<00:02:59.900> someone<00:03:00.380> walk<00:03:00.680> I<00:03:01.100> think

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
impossible to make someone walk I think

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.110 
impossible to make someone walk I think
I'm<00:03:02.150> gonna<00:03:02.299> follow<00:03:02.600> my<00:03:02.900> grandmother's<00:03:03.440> advice
