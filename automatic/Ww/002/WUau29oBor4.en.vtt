I've ever had the chance to play around

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.320 
I've ever had the chance to play around
with<00:00:32.740> it's<00:00:33.100> a<00:00:33.190> very<00:00:33.400> simple<00:00:33.730> set<00:00:33.880> of<00:00:33.970> controls

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:34.330

that can give you a massive range of
distortion<00:00:36.880> sounds<00:00:37.300> the<00:00:37.810> gain<00:00:38.050> control

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:38.560 
distortion sounds the gain control

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.160 
distortion sounds the gain control
controls<00:00:39.340> how<00:00:39.730> much<00:00:39.940> distortion<00:00:40.329> the<00:00:40.900> pedal

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
controls how much distortion the pedal

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.260 
controls how much distortion the pedal
is<00:00:41.260> generating<00:00:41.800> and<00:00:41.920> dial<00:00:42.489> back<00:00:42.700> to<00:00:43.000> give<00:00:43.180> you

you<00:00:46.000> crank<00:00:46.360> that<00:00:46.690> then<00:00:47.020> you<00:00:47.140> can<00:00:47.290> get<00:00:47.440> some

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
you crank that then you can get some

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.490 
you crank that then you can get some
really<00:00:47.949> harsh<00:00:48.190> distortion<00:00:48.850> or<00:00:49.030> creamy<00:00:49.989> fuzz

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
really harsh distortion or creamy fuzz

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.619 
really harsh distortion or creamy fuzz
sounds<00:00:51.010> this<00:00:51.160> loads<00:00:51.579> of<00:00:51.730> great<00:00:52.000> sounds<00:00:52.480> and

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
sounds this loads of great sounds and

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:54.569 
sounds this loads of great sounds and
engaging<00:00:53.469> the<00:00:53.649> drive<00:00:53.859> switch<00:00:54.100> will<00:00:54.309> give<00:00:54.460> you

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
engaging the drive switch will give you

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.200 
engaging the drive switch will give you
even<00:00:54.789> more<00:00:55.480> gain<00:00:56.019> the<00:00:57.010> output<00:00:57.430> lets<00:00:57.879> you<00:00:58.000> match

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
even more gain the output lets you match

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.330 
even more gain the output lets you match
the<00:00:58.510> pedals<00:00:58.899> volume<00:00:59.230> to<00:00:59.680> your<00:00:59.710> ounce<00:00:59.920> volume

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
the pedals volume to your ounce volume

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.790 
the pedals volume to your ounce volume
or<00:01:00.519> you<00:01:01.030> can<00:01:01.329> turn<00:01:01.809> that<00:01:01.929> up<00:01:02.079> and<00:01:02.289> use<00:01:02.500> it<00:01:02.679> as<00:01:02.769> a

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
or you can turn that up and use it as a

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.200 
or you can turn that up and use it as a
little<00:01:03.039> bit<00:01:03.160> of<00:01:03.250> a<00:01:03.309> volume<00:01:03.640> boost<00:01:03.820> when<00:01:04.150> you

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
little bit of a volume boost when you

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.330 
little bit of a volume boost when you
engage<00:01:04.360> the<00:01:04.720> pedal<00:01:04.989> the<00:01:05.560> tone<00:01:05.740> control<00:01:06.100> is

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
engage the pedal the tone control is

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.750 
engage the pedal the tone control is
very<00:01:06.700> simply<00:01:07.090> how<00:01:07.450> bright<00:01:07.810> or<00:01:08.140> dark<00:01:08.530> the<00:01:09.490> tone

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
very simply how bright or dark the tone

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.550 
very simply how bright or dark the tone
of<00:01:09.790> your<00:01:10.060> distortion<00:01:10.690> is<00:01:10.840> going<00:01:11.080> to<00:01:11.200> be<00:01:11.320> and

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
of your distortion is going to be and

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.250 
of your distortion is going to be and
then<00:01:12.070> the<00:01:12.430> most<00:01:12.610> exciting<00:01:13.240> part<00:01:13.990> of<00:01:14.110> this

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
then the most exciting part of this

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.410 
then the most exciting part of this
pedal<00:01:14.500> which<00:01:14.800> really<00:01:15.160> sets<00:01:15.640> it<00:01:15.880> apart<00:01:15.940> from

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
pedal which really sets it apart from

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.090 
pedal which really sets it apart from
other<00:01:16.630> pedals<00:01:17.050> for<00:01:17.230> me<00:01:17.350> is<00:01:17.530> the<00:01:17.800> filter

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
other pedals for me is the filter

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.980 
other pedals for me is the filter
control<00:01:18.520> this<00:01:18.910> is<00:01:19.030> the<00:01:19.120> mode<00:01:19.300> gladder<00:01:19.600> filter

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
control this is the mode gladder filter

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.289 
control this is the mode gladder filter
which<00:01:20.170> is<00:01:20.200> taken<00:01:20.740> from<00:01:20.920> their<00:01:21.610> famous<00:01:21.880> sins

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
which is taken from their famous sins

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.270 
which is taken from their famous sins
such<00:01:22.570> as<00:01:22.750> the<00:01:22.869> Mini<00:01:23.049> Moke<00:01:23.259> Voyager<00:01:23.799> and<00:01:23.979> this

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
such as the Mini Moke Voyager and this

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.190 
such as the Mini Moke Voyager and this
will<00:01:24.430> give<00:01:24.549> you<00:01:24.670> swept<00:01:25.270> filter<00:01:25.630> sounds<00:01:25.990> so<00:01:26.140> you

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
will give you swept filter sounds so you

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.249 
will give you swept filter sounds so you
can<00:01:26.320> create<00:01:27.100> fixed<00:01:27.549> wire<00:01:27.759> sounds<00:01:28.360> really<00:01:28.960> dark

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
can create fixed wire sounds really dark

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.319 
can create fixed wire sounds really dark
and<00:01:29.500> dirty<00:01:29.650> sounds<00:01:30.250> really<00:01:30.640> open<00:01:31.090> bright

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:31.329 
and dirty sounds really open bright

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:33.210 
and dirty sounds really open bright
sounds<00:01:31.840> and<00:01:31.960> then<00:01:32.259> you<00:01:32.350> can<00:01:32.500> engage<00:01:32.770> the<00:01:32.979> peak

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
sounds and then you can engage the peak

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.160 
sounds and then you can engage the peak
which<00:01:33.700> would<00:01:33.820> give<00:01:33.939> you<00:01:34.030> a<00:01:34.090> 15<00:01:34.509> decimal<00:01:34.810> boost

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
which would give you a 15 decimal boost

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.870 
which would give you a 15 decimal boost
to<00:01:35.350> the<00:01:35.439> filter<00:01:35.770> and<00:01:36.130> get<00:01:36.250> some<00:01:36.460> really

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
to the filter and get some really

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.660 
to the filter and get some really
intense<00:01:37.540> filtered<00:01:37.960> sounds<00:01:38.409> what's<00:01:39.280> even<00:01:39.640> more

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
intense filtered sounds what's even more

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.550 
intense filtered sounds what's even more
exciting<00:01:40.390> is<00:01:40.570> that<00:01:40.659> you<00:01:40.869> can<00:01:41.079> connect<00:01:41.439> the

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
exciting is that you can connect the

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.380 
exciting is that you can connect the
Maggie<00:01:41.920> P<00:01:42.100> 3<00:01:42.310> expression<00:01:42.700> pedal<00:01:42.970> to<00:01:43.090> the<00:01:43.180> back

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
Maggie P 3 expression pedal to the back

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.090 
Maggie P 3 expression pedal to the back
and<00:01:43.630> then<00:01:43.960> you<00:01:44.079> can<00:01:44.259> control<00:01:44.649> the<00:01:44.920> filter

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
and then you can control the filter

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.010 
and then you can control the filter
suite<00:01:45.460> with<00:01:45.610> your<00:01:45.729> feet<00:01:46.000> means<00:01:46.570> you<00:01:46.750> can<00:01:46.899> use

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
suite with your feet means you can use

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.709 
suite with your feet means you can use
it<00:01:47.140> as<00:01:47.229> a<00:01:47.259> distortion<00:01:48.130> wire<00:01:48.700> pedal<00:01:49.180> so<00:01:49.509> you<00:01:49.600> can

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:49.719 
it as a distortion wire pedal so you can

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:52.109 
it as a distortion wire pedal so you can
get<00:01:49.869> an<00:01:50.049> absolutely<00:01:50.560> massive<00:01:50.860> array<00:01:51.850> of

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
get an absolutely massive array of

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.569 
get an absolutely massive array of
sounds<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:53.530> we're<00:01:53.770> going<00:01:53.920> to<00:01:53.979> show<00:01:54.369> you<00:01:54.399> what

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:54.579 
sounds and we're going to show you what

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:08.980
