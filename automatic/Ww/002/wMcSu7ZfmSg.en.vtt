 you can also just a stale 0 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.160
 to take that is important for the 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.950
 Binding the soup all the ingredients that will 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:36.750
 i have shown them mixa and become 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:48.630
 nicely so kinda cured now 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:51.709
 olive oil on it must be enough now 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.709
 season with salt 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:03:00.170
 olive oil so the finished gazpacho 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.300
 either put in the fridge and 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.760

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.660
 the whole not even above never with a 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.340
 Few patrons so crumbled feta cheese 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.950
 ajar against my at my 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.450
 watermelons fathers salad from the last 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.940
 The soup is ready I had 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.980
 now given in to a wine glass 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.360
 then you can just slip out of that 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.170
 roadway also in dice so would 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.150
 I serve that 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:32.140
 but still likes to spoon and it 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:35.570
 to spoon tastes total 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:38.690
 refreshingly nice and cold refreshing 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.670
 and delicious will be around later in yes 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.280
 Fathers watermelon are simply 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.960
 tastes totally delicious together it is 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.520
 not sweet either or that 's not possible 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.530
 that it is such a smoothie, it is 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.760
 that's why it's not so nice 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.760
 I would recommend a hot pepper 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.440
 Hanover or simply a lot of club 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:59.210
 to go to make it really beautiful 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:02.980
 but I think the wise and the 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.980
 Charlotte also give their part 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.500
 So super mega great port for riding 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.950

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:16.010

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.930

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.790
