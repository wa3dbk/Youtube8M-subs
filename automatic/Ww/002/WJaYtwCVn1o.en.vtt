 show how age of empires 2d age of 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.800
 Kings also on current operating system 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.019
 like windows 8 windows 7 windows vista 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.230
 or play on windows xp 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.199
 and I'll show you in the video how 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:23.340
 give her the graphics error in the game 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:26.900
 could and the game works both 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.970
 32 bit system as well as 64 bit 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:34.070
 operating system and we start in the 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.070
 we give only once on my website 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:48.600
 www.games doctor pc.de and then here on 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:53.010
 tutorials players and gtc on age of 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:57.000
 empires 2 and now comes something 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.800
 down and load yourself two things 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.440
 patch the game down once 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.110
 Let's play the game on the latest version 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.750
 and then we need another batch 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.020
 file that file you need 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.610
 Thus the play then without graphic error 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.900
 works and then we still have to 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.460
 a few changes to the city ​​file 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.080
 but I'll show you the same 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.659
 even now we start the first 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.659
 downloads sounds so here now 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:35.010
 and we save the file and now 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.650
 let's go back to the 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:48.540
 website and also load the batch file 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:51.870
 down and the Spaniards too and 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:56.580
 Now we can use the internet explorer 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:02:01.229
 first close and go in now 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:05.370
 the windows explorer and start only 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:09.080
 once the installation of the game and 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.080
 To do this, we go to the setup file 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:25.090
 and starts to install go to 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:29.080
 continue and we will be the 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:31.330
 complete installation and we 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.690
 install the game in the standard 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.810
 directory but still go search 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:42.849
 and I install the game as always 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:45.340
 in my mother player and that 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:48.130
 directory age of empires 2 is now 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.950
 newly created we confirmed as the whole 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.019
 with ok and now asked me if that 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:57.400
 folder is to be created 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:03:00.970
 we confirm with yes and go now 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:04.120
 We continue and the installation 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.709
 starts so the installation is 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.720
 we want to finish the game 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.890
 do not play and go now 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:15.040
 once to the setup menu and finish that 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.799
 menu and we are back in now 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.200
 windows explorer and now only give 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:22.510
 once in the download directory where 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.609
 we downloaded from the two files 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.859
 So we have the patch here 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:31.000
 game which you run first and then 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:33.069
 the batch file and we mark now 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.500
 both files with the left mouse button 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:38.109
 then you click here as the right one 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.989
 maustaste it's time to cut and 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:42.549
 Now we go to our player where 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:46.680
 we have just installed the game 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:49.090
 and then in the folder age of empires 2 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:53.470
 and you click on the right one 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.919
 mouse button and then click insert and 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:04:03.209
 Now let's start the patch 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:04:06.099
 click here double confirm with ok 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:09.599
 and the hedge fund led the in word 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:09.599
 file we do not read now and 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:17.139
 confirm that with ok and now you have to 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:19.539
 her another important change 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:21.810
 you go with the first 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:24.669
 left mouse button on the city ​​file 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.310
 now lies on the right mouse button and 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:30.969
 then go to properties in the 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.990
 rider compatibility and power now 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:34.419
 So the first one already 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.849
 By default, then do one here 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:40.030
 hook in compatibility mode and selects 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:41.320
 your windows xp service pack 2 off and on 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.140
 also makes a hook here the program 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:47.320
 as an administrator , this is done 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:49.210
 whole you confirm with ok and if 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.690
 Now double click on the file then 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.430
 can you start the game already 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:57.280
 It also works though 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.890
 in the game graphic error and that 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:03.010
 Of course we do not want to 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:04.479
 and would need to resolve the animal the 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.289
 you always have to start before the start 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:07.630
 play 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:09.180
 then go to the task manager 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.469
 close explorer 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.090
 then you can start the game 

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:14.710
 works without graphic errors and then 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.510
 you have to go back to the task manager 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.099
 go and stop the explorer again 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.130
 so the default setting again 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:22.270
 has been made or 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.750
 default setting restored 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.260
 become 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.430
 and because the goal is quite expensive 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.070
 but I have a batch file for this 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.890
 created and I open it once 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:35.800
 So you also have some content of this batch 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:36.990
 file is so you see you are the explorer 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.599
 will be closed 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:42.729
 and then the game is started 12 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:46.020
 exil this is the city file 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:48.909
 and the explorer will be back afterwards 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:53.320
 started and that works 

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:54.849
 game without graphic errors and the only one 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.560
 what you have to do you just have to do 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:58.030
 double is allowed to click the batch file and 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.530
 then the game will be automatic 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:03.460
 started and that works as I said without 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.260
 graphic errors as you can the 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.900
 file theoretically also set up yourself 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.250
 I also have the text on the or the 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.110
 content of the file I have again 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.240
 stated on the website 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.279
 but the easiest thing is to invite her 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:18.250
 file down and start with it like 

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:19.659
 said the game yes and that should be 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.950
 play as I said without problems when 

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:25.820
 do not care about 32 bit or 4 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:28.310
 60 bit version of your operating system 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:30.640
 and now I wish you much fun with 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.640
 the game
