consider the barrier of seasons

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.270 
consider the barrier of seasons
sometimes<00:01:49.049> there<00:01:49.350> are<00:01:49.409> different<00:01:49.680> seasons<00:01:50.100> in

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
people's lives who are starting a

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.109 
people's lives who are starting a
business<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:52.200> really<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.799> good<00:01:53.310> time<00:01:53.490> or<00:01:53.759> maybe

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
business is really a good time or maybe

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.999 
business is really a good time or maybe
it's<00:01:54.450> just<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:55.140> little<00:01:55.170> bit<00:01:55.439> too<00:01:55.590> much<00:01:55.740> on<00:01:55.890> the

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
it's just a little bit too much on the

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.530 
it's just a little bit too much on the
plate<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.670> should<00:01:56.850> wait<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.090> couple

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
plate and you should wait a couple

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.410 
plate and you should wait a couple
months<00:01:57.719> until<00:01:58.049> something<00:01:58.790> calms<00:01:59.790> down<00:01:59.969> but

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
months until something calms down but

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.929 
months until something calms down but
really<00:02:00.869> my<00:02:01.020> best<00:02:01.259> suggestion<00:02:01.649> is<00:02:01.890> there's<00:02:02.130> no

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
really my best suggestion is there's no

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.490 
really my best suggestion is there's no
