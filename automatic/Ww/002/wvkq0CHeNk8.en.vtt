00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.799
 the books and the translation made her raisa 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.289
 and I think it's already starting to be what 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.029
 from more people I saw that Alberto now that 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.189
 Lee did it but I have not seen the video 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.199

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:27.720
 but good is to take about 2 3 4 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:30.179
 679 I create diseases and transform them 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.560

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.480
 very sweet book really sweet very 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.520
 it made me even sweeter than air 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.100
 muscle and more because he a mom was so 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.890
 as well as how ugly and how sad and 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.950
 depressing and then this and physical came 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.260
 musician or even at his time when I 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.660
 they still liked the story this 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.430
 I 've always been the one that liked me 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.350
 all the more chickenpox a book that 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.470
 you read once and you'll never read again 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.410
 the truce of mario benedetti is a book 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.330
 super short kill as the month when reading 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.520
 this to me benedetti I like its 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.430
 possibility almost always but daughter 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.430
 holler there are many people who do love 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.440
 I do not know I did not like influenza a book that 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.610
 it seems to them like a virus I do not think it's 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:20.190
 need they have to say 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.190
 absolutely nothing about this book 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.409
 more than these copies of my sister and not 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.620
 mine the cycle a book that every month 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.380
 year 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.460
 peter james barrie where this is already the 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.860
 I have said many times but I still 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.840
 love unam peterpanes and novels 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.070
 favorite is all underlined my book 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.170
 because it has a lot of phrases 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.020
 very beautiful in the thing with books 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.300
 for children that are for children I think 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.990
 that adults understand them from a 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:49.479
 very very interesting way then with 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.800
 the time as I read it every time 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.830
 I understand it differently I do not know if it 's the 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.619
 book that changes or I change but not 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.690
 I know insomnia a book that kept you 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.910
 I wake up all night but I thought about 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.310
 books that kept me awake in 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.649
 the aspect that I can not hard l but 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.200
 have been many so analyze the 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.239
 stay awake in something else and choose 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.160
 the extraordinary narrations of edgar 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.160
 allan poe because several laws 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.980
 first ones that were afraid or whether 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.870
 I did not want to fall asleep so I 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.370
 happens in their stories and after 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.020
 something 3 in the morning and I was 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.510
 being afraid I can sleep after 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.190
 I said already think about something else and I do not know how 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.920
 mind went until I got to the fact 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.650
 to think about the poor because it was a 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.570
 alcoholic and he had so many things in 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.820
 his head that we can reflect on his 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.250
 work and in the body then I got to 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.780
 to think is like I did not stain I went and 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.960
 I thought all this do that it was six or 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.240
 day and not sleep that night asthma a book 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.350
 who stole your breath the guest of 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.920
 stephanie meyer 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:56.900
 I was too surprised by this book 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:00.960
 I have no words to explain how much 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.790
 I said that one twilight and says 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.400
 be good the same author of another book 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.620
 and you expect that similar idea from 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.330
 love triangle or that at least 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.520
 Some of the characters know us by 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.080
 that here edward or something like that and this is 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.300
 completely different to start is 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.950
 a novel considered for adults what 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.930
 which has no erotic content you have to 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.730
 learning to differentiate genres is not a 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.640
 teen love 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:27.220
 great and mint that I was heartburn 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.900
 what is happening and how 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.340
 It surprised both history and 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.200
 that was the same author that 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.740
 the twilight then net and better without 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.020
 I encourage malnutrition a book that 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:41.380
 food was missing for the brain this is not 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.940
 I have the book live but I made one 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.710
 review of this book and then leave 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.930
 over here that is if I do not wake up the 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.280
 free organ there I have the teach and what 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.930
 can take but good in a few 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.640
 words the idea was good but not 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.640
 it was well developed lacked the 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.740
 ox and finally cinema dose a book 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.840
 that took you on a trip through the 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:02.830
 time and space I will choose one of 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.900
 my books is an epic poem but in my 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.060
 favorite books that is what it says to number 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.340
 in what for the school and I had to 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.840
 read everything I had to read analysis on 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.490
 the book and I had to write essays 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.680
 about this story then during 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.600
 a long time I was related to this 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.609
 history and with the iliada this in 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.070
 special others that in the iliada 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:23.620
 reality is a little more historical by 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.600
 so to say it has a historical feeling 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.590
 as it is very factual this was what 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.710
 it happened and this 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.900
 like the adventures of ulises di zeo 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.120
 going home and going through a lot 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.330
 of very intense things and I love the 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.160
 centers when he arrives with the cyclops and 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.470
 the truth I like a jet when going 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.970
 the underworld and all I love me 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.540
 really love then that this 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:48.639
 book locked me in the world and it gave me 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.620
 fear sometimes then this book is the 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.240
 that has made me travel a lot more 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.710
 july verne have made me travel like the 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.050
 journey within the earth the 20,000 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.910
 leagues and the mysterious island and all those 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.220
 they are more known but if all the 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.770
 others have made me travel a lot but 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.200
 this is the one that I think that's why 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.240
 that analyzed it so much had more impact on 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.120
 I respect that of traveling so much and 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:13.210
 know so much without moving and this is all 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.310
 the workshop I hope it was good 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.690
 normal I do not know in both magazines of rice 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.280
 then what kind of answers 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.570
 are giving the other habitat I'm going to 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.700
 talk about Alberto to see how I hope 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.560
 that they have it and if they put it on the radio 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.510
 answer arrays or can you leave me 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.889
 here on the answer road or write 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.960
 in your answers of what do you think 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:30.460
 about the books that I told them maybe 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.080
 It is very likely that you and 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:38.850
 like many of the genes 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:41.729
 saying and I forgot one returns fa 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:44.889
 amnesia I'm missing a disease pause 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:47.260
 we return amnesia book that you forgot 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:49.000
 you have chosen or failed in the week 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.240
 impression in your mind until I forgot 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.949
 the question books by paulo coelho is 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.080
 so strange I remember that they are treated 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:57.880
 but the net sometimes I think and I say no 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.410
 read by a cruel one or not is that if I have 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.330
 read or if I know how you write there's all 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:03.370
 the structure and everything but which one read 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.770
 chosen now they told me to die I read 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.270
 the alchemist I read the pilgrim not 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:09.220
 I know which one read so the ones coming from 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:12.190
 least I think I read 11 minutes not 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:15.400
 planet tells us but there it is 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:17.110
 that is, I do not know what I read of him when 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.240
 I read it the truth I have no idea what 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.949
 borrowed or I read it from some 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:24.490
 I do not know any book that I have 

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:25.870
 read everything retired does not remember good 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.539
 now yes this is the whole tag 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:30.370
 I'm in shock, I'm our epitome 

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:32.020
 can be answers the video response 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:36.160

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:38.620
 on facebook and on youtube and blogspot and 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.419
 burned and on my second channel with my 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.740
 roots that did the translation this is 

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:43.990
 well have gone up I leave here 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:46.980
 also those of Alberto and that's all 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.980
 its alot
