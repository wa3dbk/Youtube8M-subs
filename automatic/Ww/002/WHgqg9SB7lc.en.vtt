00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 and good morning to all and all 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.950
 tube family today we end up 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.440
 for a new tutorial on minecraft 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.760
 console so I hope you go 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.950
 well anyway for me it's going nickel 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.660
 clothes and today we're going 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.670
 just do a little tutorial for 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.130
 know how to access on the roof of a 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.890
 heather yes you heard of course 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.510
 is below 25 now and we're going 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.100
 can access on the auto ginger with 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.980
 two small techniques that are 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.750
 really very very simple so here is eh 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.099
 Well, we're going straight to start 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.480
 talk about the first technique that's 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.000
 a technique with the same map as 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.530
 I found out about a video of the 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.600
 Rennes so that I place its chain 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.250
 will be in the description and the second 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.410
 Technical is with beads odors 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.239
 I knew since very, very 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.280
 long time so this technique market 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.899
 all the time so these are the parties of 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.940
 friends you create a little portal you 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.989
 go inside you're heading 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.550
 towards the roof simply 1up 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.980
 I do not teach you anything so there it was 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.289
 another another another another and that's 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.969
 So you'll hop on top so 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.489
 of course you survive so sultan 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.949
 tutorial walk in comes the friends that 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.450
 there's no problem this tutorial so 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.490
 women of course in this video sorry 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.930
 loose breaking the beautiful rock 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.790
 but yours of course you do not 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.960
 can not broke the rock bay and I 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.450
 I can not break so the last 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.320
 bedrock even though I'm a creative 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.900
 so here are the friends when you did 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.460
 that's it that's nickel is friends so he 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.460
 You must take a small card 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.439
 and when you see y 126 you will 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.049
 start the tutorial so you really have to 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.210
 head up a heather and 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.799
 when you have there 126 well you 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.350
 can start the tutorial here 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.329
 when you have there 126 you have to 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.470
 find a small place so I take 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.009
 a small project can be a small block 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.270
 like that when you arrive so while 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.100
 high you have to find a little 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.829
 place so like these, ie 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:54.810
 a small closed block of bedrock here 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.040
 like these and long blocks 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.810
 hours that's it's very very 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.360
 important friends otherwise the tutorial does not 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.920
 will not walk and it's going all night and 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.960
 you will even die in the bay of 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.260
 rock so that's going to sell and not too much 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.660
 here is 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.030
 So then when you have these two so 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.500
 small this little tip we will say 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.750
 to reach the roof 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.870
 so you position a small scale 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.130
 at the bottom of this block you put some 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.570
 mesh because so of course there you 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.850
 would be rails booster it's 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.290
 essential the friends otherwise it is necessary that the 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.490
 mike hart are gaining momentum for 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.560
 they are then directed to the 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.760
 chains and that's very important so there 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.980
 course power I have is 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.450
 to support to put a little rail and 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.820
 it does not work so simply 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.160
 you put a rail here a rail rail 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.650
 rail obstacles here we can break we're going 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.450
 say and you put so we'll say a 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.970
 small block which for example that down 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.010
 hop tac 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.210
 that's nickel you have to feed must 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.950
 that it still takes a little bit of 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.960
 speed 1 as I told you you 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.820
 position your map hand here and you 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.160
 just have to push it friends here 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.200
 nickel and power that the mike hart has 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.959
 exceeded this rail you can break here 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.050
 tak tak nickel and power he is 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.730
 really very very close to 2 of 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.870
 the scale and so you can even the 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.270
 push a little bit for it to be 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.640
 really complete and when you did 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.959
 that the years you simply have 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.150
 finish the first the first 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.010
 technique to access the roof of a 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.989
 error and now you just have to 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.030
 get into the mike hart so for the 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.709
 technique then must be well 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.760
 to listen is simply that you 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.220
 enter the same card 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.810
 you have to come out directly and 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.190
 that you direct to the chains so 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.840
 that is all right and that you 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.980
 spam the button to skip it 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.530
 it's very very important 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.120
 otherwise you will die and the ladder is 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.410
 really very important for this 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.380
 technique because if there is no 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.959
 of scale you suffocate in the block and 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.820
 it shows it's annoying 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.290
 so here is well thought of course to 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.970
 back up before doing this little 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.519
 technical because if it's fair 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.870
 here you are leaving because I 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.300
 surely do the team and I 'm dead 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.610
 I had 42 level this little more disgusted 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.200
 but good short so we'll try so 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.420
 you go back into the mind map you 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.040
 go straight out and climb 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.470
 the scale here is so I put a 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.820
 little portal power is very very 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.709
 simple friends and more you can access 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.890
 to the roof but not to make usa out 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.720
 usa gast a lot of things friends and 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.340
 it's interesting for them to do 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.900
 a small village where case or if you 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.230
 want to hide on a server in 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.239
 line 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.230
 it can be not bad so here 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.730
 now to do the second 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.800
 technique we go out of 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.570
 gold tie up especially do not forget one of 

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.180
 friends, you still need obsidian 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.500
 if you go to the desert roof if 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.330
 you are not a creative because 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.190
 otherwise you will not be able to go out 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.340
 So that's what I did 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.850
 two holes choice it was there yeah I 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:39.670
 believe it was here seems to me 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:41.260
 yeah that's it here nick is so the 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.820
 second technique it's with the help of 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.160
 landmark friends so that's very 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.840
 simple by cons to have a maximum 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.640
 of benchmarks try to achieve 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.170
 norman there is at all on my channel 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.720
 also if you want to see to do 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:55.000
 a factory in norman so you put in 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.590
 126 block 1 as usual is everything 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.350
 you just need a little 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.760
 stack of a seller beads or even 4 5 that 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.950
 is enough but good little stack is not 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.680
 evil of course the obsidian to to make a 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:08.490
 portal and to be able to get out of the 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.170
 roof and so you're directing your 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.850
 your hand towards the roof and you 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.680
 spam button 1 to throw the area 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.300
 north lose and you jump that's all 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.760
 simply friends it's very simple 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.530
 it's faster than doing my card 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.930
 but at least it does not smell 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.570
 pearls the techniques of mind maps and 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.890
 then it's very simple here are the friends 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.770
 so these were the two little techniques 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:31.540
 to get out of the desert so go on the 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.220
 roof and I hope you enjoyed it 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.600
 so do not hesitate to put a little 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.100
 blue thumb hundred to reach the 100 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.040
 I like it makes me booster to do 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.780
 new tutorial and share video 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.790
 also to follow him on the networks 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.050
 social who are in the description and 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.340
 to subscribe if it is not yet 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.110
 so do I tell you go back to 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.150
 next time for 2012 on 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.450
 minecraft what a kiss to all and charles 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.450
 everybody
