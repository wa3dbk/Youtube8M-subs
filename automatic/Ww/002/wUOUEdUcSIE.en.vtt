ascension process and to move into
another<00:04:11.409> dimension<00:04:11.769> so<00:04:12.220> that<00:04:12.250> they<00:04:12.489> didn't

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
another dimension so that they didn't

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.680 
another dimension so that they didn't
have<00:04:12.879> to<00:04:13.090> come<00:04:13.689> back<00:04:14.730> now<00:04:15.730> the<00:04:15.790> gold<00:04:16.150> was<00:04:16.419> a

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
have to come back now the gold was a

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.930 
have to come back now the gold was a
regenerator<00:04:17.500> it<00:04:17.799> kept<00:04:18.100> their<00:04:18.280> bodies<00:04:18.400> alive

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
regenerator it kept their bodies alive

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.219 
regenerator it kept their bodies alive
for<00:04:19.269> that<00:04:19.359> time<00:04:19.630> period<00:04:19.660> so<00:04:21.840> home<00:04:22.840> they<00:04:23.020> come

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
for that time period so home they come

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.350 
for that time period so home they come
and<00:04:23.500> being<00:04:24.039> two<00:04:24.340> engineers<00:04:24.820> Vernon<00:04:25.210> and

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
Calvin are both engineers they built a

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.590 
Calvin are both engineers they built a
machine<00:04:27.810> that<00:04:28.810> could<00:04:29.050> actually<00:04:29.260> take<00:04:30.600> using

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
machine that could actually take using

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
simul simulating like it's like

it's very high voltage very low current
and<00:04:37.960> it's<00:04:38.680> um<00:04:39.900> they<00:04:40.900> take<00:04:41.139> it<00:04:41.400> and<00:04:42.400> this

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 
and it's um they take it and this

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:44.700 
and it's um they take it and this
machine<00:04:42.880> it<00:04:43.240> splits<00:04:43.660> oxygen<00:04:44.440> and<00:04:44.590> hydrogen

ounces of gold every tonne of water and

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.710 
ounces of gold every tonne of water and
I<00:05:32.110> go<00:05:32.260> through<00:05:32.470> a<00:05:32.500> ton<00:05:32.740> of<00:05:32.770> water<00:05:33.720> twenty-year

I go through a ton of water twenty-year

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.250 
I go through a ton of water twenty-year
and<00:05:35.460> we<00:05:36.460> don't<00:05:36.699> because<00:05:37.479> we<00:05:37.510> use<00:05:37.750> a<00:05:37.780> template

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
and we don't because we use a template

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.320 
and we don't because we use a template
we<00:05:38.440> don't<00:05:38.620> ever<00:05:38.830> go<00:05:39.070> through<00:05:39.099> a<00:05:39.340> goal

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
we don't ever go through a goal

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:47.080 
we don't ever go through a goal
so<00:05:41.900> the<00:05:42.020> cape<00:05:42.199> woman<00:05:42.500> that<00:05:42.590> created<00:05:42.919> this<00:05:46.090> so

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
so the cape woman that created this so

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.719 
so the cape woman that created this so
that's<00:05:47.240> real<00:05:47.599> gold<00:05:47.870> that's<00:05:48.740> just<00:05:49.099> made<00:05:49.400> out<00:05:49.699> of

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:49.729 
that's real gold that's just made out of

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:51.550 
that's real gold that's just made out of
the<00:05:49.909> air<00:05:50.060> gold<00:05:50.419> actually<00:05:50.870> it's<00:05:51.169> made<00:05:51.319> out<00:05:51.440> of

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 
the air gold actually it's made out of

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.149 
the air gold actually it's made out of
water<00:05:51.740> gold<00:05:53.110> so<00:05:54.110> we're<00:05:54.500> playing<00:05:54.680> alchemy

00:05:55.149 --> 00:05:55.159 
water gold so we're playing alchemy

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:58.570 
water gold so we're playing alchemy
there<00:05:55.539> cerise<00:05:56.539> alchemy<00:05:57.020> now<00:05:57.889> this<00:05:58.190> temple

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 
there cerise alchemy now this temple

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.760 
there cerise alchemy now this temple
that<00:05:58.610> they<00:05:58.819> found<00:05:59.060> was<00:05:59.389> called<00:05:59.659> the<00:06:00.080> temple<00:06:00.530> of

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
that they found was called the temple of
