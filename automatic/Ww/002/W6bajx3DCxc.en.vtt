00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
you might even have to pause this at

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
some point but watch carefully okay we

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.070 
some point but watch carefully okay we
simply<00:01:04.489> turn<00:01:05.180> the<00:01:05.420> Xbox<00:01:05.509> on<00:01:06.020> to<00:01:06.259> its<00:01:06.410> side<00:01:06.970> and

simply turn the Xbox on to its side and

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.370 
simply turn the Xbox on to its side and
then<00:01:09.080> with<00:01:09.920> all<00:01:10.160> you've<00:01:10.580> got<00:01:10.759> to<00:01:10.850> do<00:01:10.970> now<00:01:11.380> you

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
then with all you've got to do now you

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.889 
then with all you've got to do now you
can<00:01:12.560> try<00:01:12.710> some<00:01:12.890> fancy<00:01:13.310> stuff<00:01:13.520> on<00:01:13.759> turning<00:01:14.720> off

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:14.899 
can try some fancy stuff on turning off

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:16.710 
can try some fancy stuff on turning off
and<00:01:15.140> on<00:01:15.200> with<00:01:15.410> the<00:01:15.770> out<00:01:15.979> and<00:01:16.250> all<00:01:16.340> this

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
and on with the out and all this

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.529 
and on with the out and all this
stuff<00:01:17.720> which<00:01:18.170> doesn't<00:01:18.619> work<00:01:18.820> but<00:01:19.820> the<00:01:20.330> real

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:20.539 
stuff which doesn't work but the real

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:23.280 
stuff which doesn't work but the real
solution<00:01:20.810> is<00:01:21.350> to<00:01:21.950> just<00:01:21.979> give<00:01:22.369> it<00:01:22.490> a<00:01:22.520> few<00:01:22.580> smacks

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
solution is to just give it a few smacks

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.399 
solution is to just give it a few smacks
and<00:01:24.290> now<00:01:24.409> this<00:01:24.560> does<00:01:24.830> actually<00:01:25.159> work<00:01:26.409> believe

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
and now this does actually work believe

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.320 
and now this does actually work believe
it<00:01:27.470> or<00:01:27.530> not<00:01:27.740> so<00:01:28.250> just<00:01:28.760> push<00:01:28.909> it<00:01:29.030> back<00:01:29.060> in

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
it or not so just push it back in

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.359 
it or not so just push it back in
sometimes<00:01:30.020> for<00:01:30.290> free<00:01:30.439> pushing<00:01:30.830> it<00:01:30.890> in<00:01:30.950> helps

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
sometimes for free pushing it in helps

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:40.030 
sometimes for free pushing it in helps
and<00:01:31.970> then<00:01:32.060> you<00:01:32.180> just<00:01:32.360> smudge<00:01:38.799> take<00:01:39.799> a<00:01:39.830> few

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
and then you just smudge take a few

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.359 
and then you just smudge take a few
tries<00:01:40.340> doesn't<00:01:40.729> necessarily<00:01:41.090> go<00:01:41.210> on<00:01:41.270> bus<00:01:41.540> ride

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
tries doesn't necessarily go on bus ride

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.960 
tries doesn't necessarily go on bus ride
it<00:01:43.369> does<00:01:43.520> I'm<00:01:43.670> very<00:01:43.850> lucky<00:01:44.979> yes<00:01:46.009> there<00:01:46.670> you<00:01:46.790> go

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
it does I'm very lucky yes there you go

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.359 
it does I'm very lucky yes there you go
first<00:01:47.390> try<00:01:47.810> as<00:01:48.110> you<00:01:48.170> can<00:01:48.740> see<00:01:48.860> it<00:01:48.950> doesn't<00:01:49.250> read

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
first try as you can see it doesn't read

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:50.740 
first try as you can see it doesn't read
the<00:01:49.400> disc<00:01:49.670> if<00:01:49.820> you<00:01:49.909> just<00:01:50.060> try<00:01:50.240> and<00:01:50.299> push<00:01:50.450> it<00:01:50.600> on

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
the disc if you just try and push it on

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.530 
the disc if you just try and push it on
the<00:01:50.900> first<00:01:51.680> try<00:01:52.070> that<00:01:52.520> you<00:01:53.030> can<00:01:53.180> turn<00:01:53.329> it<00:01:53.479> off

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
the first try that you can turn it off

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.030 
the first try that you can turn it off
on<00:01:53.689> its<00:01:53.810> side<00:01:53.960> so<00:01:53.990> it<00:01:54.229> can<00:01:54.380> vent<00:01:54.590> a<00:01:54.710> bit<00:01:54.740> better

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
on its side so it can vent a bit better

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.719 
on its side so it can vent a bit better
and<00:01:55.460> that<00:01:55.780> is<00:01:56.780> how<00:01:57.229> you<00:01:57.290> get<00:01:57.650> your<00:01:57.890> Xbox<00:01:58.579> to

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.780 

right<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.800> get<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.040> to<00:02:11.130> read<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.340> desk<00:02:11.550> you

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
right to get it to read the desk you

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.030 
right to get it to read the desk you
open<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.420> disk<00:02:12.630> tray<00:02:13.050> like<00:02:13.320> so<00:02:13.710> and<00:02:15.080> you<00:02:16.080> push

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
open the disk tray like so and you push

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:27.890 
open the disk tray like so and you push
the<00:02:17.190> disc<00:02:17.310> tray<00:02:17.490> back<00:02:24.380> like<00:02:25.380> that<00:02:26.570> now<00:02:27.570> it<00:02:27.720> does

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
the disc tray back like that now it does

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.460 
the disc tray back like that now it does
make<00:02:28.110> some<00:02:28.380> unhappy<00:02:28.980> noises
