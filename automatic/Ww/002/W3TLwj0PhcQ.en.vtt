00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
now with whole-wheat bread what they do

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.450 
now with whole-wheat bread what they do
is<00:00:33.059> they<00:00:33.960> take<00:00:34.199> the<00:00:34.410> grains<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.010> they<00:00:35.129> mash

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
them up with Ezekiel bread they are

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.309 
them up with Ezekiel bread they are
actually<00:00:39.000> sprouting<00:00:39.659> the<00:00:39.780> grains<00:00:40.019> there<00:00:40.260> are

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:40.319 
actually sprouting the grains there are

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:42.229 
actually sprouting the grains there are
live<00:00:40.559> brains<00:00:40.980> what<00:00:41.579> do<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:41.699> mean<00:00:41.850> by<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.059> so

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
live brains what do I mean by that so

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.720 
live brains what do I mean by that so
what<00:00:42.390> they<00:00:42.510> do<00:00:42.569> is<00:00:43.019> they<00:00:44.010> start<00:00:44.069> off<00:00:44.460> with<00:00:44.640> the

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
what they do is they start off with the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.759 
what they do is they start off with the
same<00:00:44.940> exact<00:00:45.269> ingredient<00:00:45.780> whole<00:00:46.319> wheat<00:00:46.530> bread

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:46.769 
same exact ingredient whole wheat bread

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:49.399 
same exact ingredient whole wheat bread
and<00:00:46.800> Ezekiel<00:00:47.339> bread<00:00:47.519> are<00:00:47.989> initially<00:00:48.989> started

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:49.409 
and Ezekiel bread are initially started

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:52.040 
and Ezekiel bread are initially started
off<00:00:49.550> with<00:00:50.550> whole<00:00:50.969> grains<00:00:51.390> that's<00:00:51.749> how<00:00:51.899> they

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
off with whole grains that's how they

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.049 
off with whole grains that's how they
make<00:00:52.260> them<00:00:52.440> now<00:00:52.889> with<00:00:53.309> regular<00:00:53.729> whole<00:00:53.879> wheat

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
make them now with regular whole wheat

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.910 
make them now with regular whole wheat

they'll mix flour into it and then they
start<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.620> bread<00:01:01.769> making<00:01:02.100> process<00:01:02.519> what<00:01:02.969> they

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
start the bread making process what they

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.479 
start the bread making process what they
do<00:01:03.210> here<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.899> food<00:01:04.379> for<00:01:04.620> life<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.979> Ezekiel

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
do here the food for life is Ezekiel

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
bread is they'll take those same whole

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.180 
bread is they'll take those same whole
grains<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.840> they<00:01:09.840> keep<00:01:10.200> them<00:01:10.470> in<00:01:10.680> their<00:01:10.860> live

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
grains and they keep them in their live

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.340 
grains and they keep them in their live
form<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:11.939> their<00:01:12.030> live<00:01:12.299> state<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:12.960> they'll

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
form and their live state and they'll

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.050 
form and their live state and they'll
sprout<00:01:14.009> them<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.579> that<00:01:14.700> they<00:01:14.850> actually

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
sprout them so that they actually

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.990 
sprout them so that they actually
increase<00:01:16.020> in<00:01:16.350> nutrition<00:01:16.860> content<00:01:17.460> vitamin

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
increase in nutrition content vitamin

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.450 
increase in nutrition content vitamin
content<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.600> mineral<00:01:19.350> content<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.280> get

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
content and mineral content so you get

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.279 
content and mineral content so you get
more<00:01:20.640> protein<00:01:20.909> you're<00:01:21.630> getting<00:01:21.840> more<00:01:22.020> fiber

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:22.289 
more protein you're getting more fiber

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:24.230 
more protein you're getting more fiber
and<00:01:22.619> it's<00:01:23.430> going<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.609> be<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.729> lower<00:01:24.000> glycemic

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
and it's going to be a lower glycemic

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.389 
and it's going to be a lower glycemic
index<00:01:25.229> as<00:01:25.380> well<00:01:25.409> for<00:01:25.829> those<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.280> are
