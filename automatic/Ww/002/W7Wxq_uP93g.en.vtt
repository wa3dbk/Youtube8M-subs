knob selects the drum sound which is
some<00:00:23.519> with<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.880> cbn<00:00:24.480> so<00:00:24.750> you<00:00:24.840> can<00:00:25.019> have<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.289> cv

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
some with the cbn so you can have it cv

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.130 
some with the cbn so you can have it cv
control<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.220> drum<00:00:26.430> sound<00:00:26.779> the<00:00:27.779> other<00:00:27.930> knob

control the drum sound the other knob

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.620 
control the drum sound the other knob
controls<00:00:28.320> pitch<00:00:28.859> which<00:00:29.250> you<00:00:30.060> can<00:00:30.240> either<00:00:30.359> turn

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
controls pitch which you can either turn

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.520 
controls pitch which you can either turn
with<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.840> knob<00:00:31.080> or<00:00:31.320> cv<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:32.579> your<00:00:32.730> clock<00:00:33.059> in

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
with a knob or cv and your clock in

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.799 
with a knob or cv and your clock in
basically<00:00:34.530> triggers<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.190> sound<00:00:35.540> so<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.570> have<00:00:36.780> a

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
basically triggers the sound so I have a

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.959 
basically triggers the sound so I have a
sequence<00:00:37.170> or<00:00:37.410> changing<00:00:37.950> drum<00:00:38.250> sound<00:00:40.940> we<00:00:41.940> can

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
sequence or changing drum sound we can

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:52.790 
sequence or changing drum sound we can
dress<00:00:42.450> with<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.780> bit<00:00:51.320> can<00:00:52.320> hear<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.590> pitch

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
dress with it a bit can hear the pitch

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:13.219 
dress with it a bit can hear the pitch
changing<00:01:11.270> and<00:01:12.270> let's<00:01:12.510> put<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.659> baseline<00:01:13.110> in

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
changing and let's put a baseline in

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:22.730 
changing and let's put a baseline in
with<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:20.210> and<00:01:21.210> there<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.509> have<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:22.500> one

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
with it and there you have it so one

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:37.730 
with it and there you have it so one
more<00:01:22.920> use<00:01:23.189> for<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.520> art<00:01:23.670> core<00:01:36.380> I'm<00:01:37.380> just<00:01:37.409> going

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
more use for the art core I'm just going

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.929 
more use for the art core I'm just going
to<00:01:37.770> stick<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.070> voltage<00:01:38.549> control<00:01:40.909> into<00:01:41.909> the

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
to stick a voltage control into the

00:01:41.939 --> 00:02:06.740 
to stick a voltage control into the
pitch<00:01:42.450> in<00:01:42.990> put<00:01:44.780> put<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:45.930> into<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.290> slow<00:01:46.680> LFO
