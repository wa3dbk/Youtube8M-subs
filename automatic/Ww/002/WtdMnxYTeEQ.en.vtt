are<00:00:49.680> lots<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.070> options<00:00:50.250> out<00:00:50.640> there<00:00:50.969> but<00:00:51.210> that's

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
are lots of options out there but that's

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.290 
are lots of options out there but that's
really<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.930> case-by-case<00:00:52.260> basis<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:53.460> when<00:00:54.210> it

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
really a case-by-case basis so when it

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.150 
really a case-by-case basis so when it
comes<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.629> makeup<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:55.199> think<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.829> know<00:00:55.949> whether

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.709 
comes to makeup I think you know whether
you<00:00:56.340> use<00:00:56.520> foundation<00:00:57.210> or<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.360> tinted

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
you use foundation or a tinted

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.930 
you use foundation or a tinted
moisturizer<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.800> think<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.430> important<00:00:59.910> to

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
moisturizer I think it is important to

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.150 
moisturizer I think it is important to
set<00:01:00.239> those<00:01:00.420> things<00:01:00.480> with<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.020> powder<00:01:01.410> consider

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
set those things with a powder consider

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.640 
set those things with a powder consider
using<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.670> matte<00:01:03.000> bronzer<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.899> think<00:01:04.229> it's<00:01:04.379> kind

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
using a matte bronzer I think it's kind

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.910 
using a matte bronzer I think it's kind
of<00:01:04.710> about<00:01:04.949> getting<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.479> matte<00:01:06.479> canvas<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.439> then

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
of about getting a matte canvas and then

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.830 
of about getting a matte canvas and then
you<00:01:08.369> know<00:01:08.520> getting<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:09.000> little<00:01:09.240> bit<00:01:09.390> dolled<00:01:09.659> up

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
you know getting a little bit dolled up

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.410 
you know getting a little bit dolled up
with<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.229> glowy<00:01:10.500> products<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:11.400> one<00:01:12.210> matte

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
with the glowy products so one matte

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.179 
with the glowy products so one matte
powder<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.020> think<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.439> great<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:14.070> it

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
powder that I think is great and it

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.910 
powder that I think is great and it
works<00:01:14.460> performs<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.540> lot<00:01:15.750> for<00:01:15.990> me<00:01:16.140> like<00:01:16.500> Mac

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
love for that specific reason I think

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.849 
love for that specific reason I think
it's<00:03:39.489> very<00:03:39.730> unique<00:03:39.970> is<00:03:40.359> from<00:03:40.599> lorac<00:03:40.959> and<00:03:41.349> it's

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
it's very unique is from lorac and it's

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.670 
it's very unique is from lorac and it's
called<00:03:42.129> perfectly<00:03:42.760> lit<00:03:43.060> and<00:03:43.389> the<00:03:44.199> shade<00:03:44.470> is

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
called perfectly lit and the shade is

spotlight<00:03:45.340> and<00:03:45.609> to<00:03:45.730> look<00:03:45.910> at<00:03:46.000> this<00:03:46.150> you<00:03:46.269> might

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:46.449 
spotlight and to look at this you might

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:48.180 
spotlight and to look at this you might
just<00:03:46.569> think<00:03:46.690> it<00:03:46.959> was<00:03:47.079> even<00:03:47.349> a<00:03:47.440> regular<00:03:47.650> powder

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
just think it was even a regular powder

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.000 
just think it was even a regular powder
but<00:03:49.060> really<00:03:49.510> it<00:03:49.780> does<00:03:50.199> have<00:03:50.530> just<00:03:50.859> the

but really it does have just the

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.430 
but really it does have just the

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
that because some people have said

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.509 
that because some people have said
what's<00:04:13.750> a<00:04:13.870> low<00:04:14.019> cost<00:04:14.290> option<00:04:14.560> for<00:04:15.010> that<00:04:15.190> and

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
what's a low cost option for that and

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:16.709 
what's a low cost option for that and
something<00:04:15.729> that's<00:04:15.879> kind<00:04:16.150> of<00:04:16.180> similar<00:04:16.570> from

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:16.719 
something that's kind of similar from

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:18.990 
something that's kind of similar from
the<00:04:16.780> drugstore<00:04:17.190> still<00:04:18.190> a<00:04:18.219> little<00:04:18.489> on<00:04:18.669> the<00:04:18.820> high

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
the drugstore still a little on the high

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.879 
the drugstore still a little on the high
end<00:04:19.030> of<00:04:19.299> the<00:04:19.389> drugstore<00:04:19.989> but<00:04:20.229> it's<00:04:20.349> physicians

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
end of the drugstore but it's physicians

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:21.390

for

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.790 
for

regular I think this is a translucent
face<00:04:27.639> powder<00:04:28.000> but<00:04:28.389> these<00:04:28.570> shades<00:04:28.900> all<00:04:29.080> kind<00:04:29.320> of

face powder but these shades all kind of

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.560 
face powder but these shades all kind of
blend<00:04:29.710> together<00:04:29.830> to<00:04:30.250> be<00:04:30.370> somewhat<00:04:30.790> similar<00:04:31.090> to

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
blend together to be somewhat similar to

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.170 
blend together to be somewhat similar to
what<00:04:31.780> this<00:04:32.050> one<00:04:32.320> is<00:04:32.350> it's<00:04:32.949> not<00:04:33.220> too<00:04:33.669> terribly

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
what this one is it's not too terribly
