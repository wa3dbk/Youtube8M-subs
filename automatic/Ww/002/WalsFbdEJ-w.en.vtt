00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.150 
we can do and let's go ahead and dive
straight<00:00:27.510> into<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:27.990> raids<00:00:28.199> so<00:00:28.740> first<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:29.099> all

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
see if we can have a little bit of

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.060 
see if we can have a little bit of
success<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.659> looks<00:01:10.290> like<00:01:10.380> we<00:01:10.590> ran<00:01:10.740> into<00:01:10.950> a

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
success so looks like we ran into a

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.620 
success so looks like we ran into a
spring<00:01:11.549> trap<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:11.970> I'm<00:01:12.060> actually<00:01:12.210> sort<00:01:12.479> of

these<00:02:15.180> elixir<00:02:15.660> pumps<00:02:15.930> which<00:02:16.380> means<00:02:16.620> I<00:02:16.680> can<00:02:16.830> use

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
these elixir pumps which means I can use

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.530 
these elixir pumps which means I can use
the<00:02:17.099> rest<00:02:17.250> of<00:02:17.430> them<00:02:17.550> to<00:02:17.700> focus<00:02:18.030> on<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.300> center

giant healer this is gonna be the only
time<00:02:51.030> I<00:02:51.090> use<00:02:51.360> it<00:02:51.390> today<00:02:51.750> though<00:02:51.959> let's<00:02:52.560> go

and<00:02:54.060> I've<00:02:54.239> been<00:02:54.390> using<00:02:54.600> a<00:02:54.840> lot<00:02:54.989> of<00:02:55.019> dragons

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
and I've been using a lot of dragons

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.050 
and I've been using a lot of dragons
recently<00:02:55.920> just<00:02:56.190> for<00:02:56.340> fun<00:02:56.519> because<00:02:56.730> I<00:02:56.910> don't

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
recently just for fun because I don't

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.729 
recently just for fun because I don't
care<00:02:57.239> about<00:02:57.330> a<00:02:57.450> lick<00:02:57.690> sir<00:02:57.870> and<00:02:58.049> this<00:02:58.620> is

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
care about a lick sir and this is

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.110 
care about a lick sir and this is
another<00:02:58.980> perfect<00:02:59.220> base<00:02:59.489> to<00:02:59.670> attack<00:02:59.940> with

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
another perfect base to attack with

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.850 
another perfect base to attack with
dragons<00:03:00.569> so<00:03:00.959> when<00:03:01.140> I<00:03:01.170> look<00:03:01.349> for<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.560> base<00:03:01.709> to

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
dragons so when I look for a base to

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.580 
dragons so when I look for a base to
attack<00:03:02.099> with<00:03:02.280> dragons<00:03:02.700> I<00:03:02.849> have<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.239> have

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
attack with dragons I have to have

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.900 
attack with dragons I have to have
200,000<00:03:04.590> elixir<00:03:04.950> available<00:03:05.459> because<00:03:05.640> that's

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
200,000 elixir available because that's

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.580 
200,000 elixir available because that's
pretty<00:03:06.180> much<00:03:06.269> how<00:03:06.450> much<00:03:06.630> it<00:03:06.780> cost<00:03:06.959> me<00:03:07.140> to<00:03:07.319> use

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
pretty much how much it cost me to use

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.770 
pretty much how much it cost me to use
this<00:03:07.769> strategy<00:03:07.980> so<00:03:08.489> I<00:03:09.030> want<00:03:09.299> to<00:03:09.330> make<00:03:09.540> sure<00:03:09.660> I'm

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
this strategy so I want to make sure I'm

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.539 
this strategy so I want to make sure I'm
at<00:03:09.900> least<00:03:10.049> even<00:03:10.260> on<00:03:10.560> a<00:03:10.590> lick<00:03:10.830> sir<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.160> I'm

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
at least even on a lick sir and I'm

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:12.650 
at least even on a lick sir and I'm
definitely<00:03:11.880> going<00:03:11.970> to<00:03:12.030> make<00:03:12.150> a<00:03:12.180> profit<00:03:12.420> with

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
definitely going to make a profit with

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.080 
definitely going to make a profit with
gold<00:03:12.959> so<00:03:13.290> I<00:03:13.470> should<00:03:13.920> make<00:03:14.130> a<00:03:14.160> at<00:03:14.700> least<00:03:14.970> a

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
gold so I should make a at least a

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.580 
gold so I should make a at least a
hundred<00:03:15.239> thousand<00:03:15.690> elixir<00:03:16.019> if<00:03:16.140> I<00:03:16.200> can<00:03:16.350> steal

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
hundred thousand elixir if I can steal

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.080 
hundred thousand elixir if I can steal
it<00:03:16.739> all<00:03:16.829> in<00:03:16.980> this<00:03:17.100> raid<00:03:17.280> as<00:03:17.519> well<00:03:17.760> as<00:03:17.850> I'll<00:03:17.940> make

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
it all in this raid as well as I'll make

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.120 
it all in this raid as well as I'll make
two<00:03:18.239> hundred<00:03:18.480> thousand<00:03:18.810> gold<00:03:19.049> so<00:03:19.680> let's<00:03:19.859> storm

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
two hundred thousand gold so let's storm

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.470 
two hundred thousand gold so let's storm
with<00:03:20.250> our<00:03:20.370> dragons<00:03:20.760> through<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.030> top<00:03:21.209> right

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
with our dragons through the top right

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.180 
with our dragons through the top right
because<00:03:21.840> one<00:03:22.019> of<00:03:22.109> his<00:03:22.200> air<00:03:22.350> defense<00:03:22.620> is<00:03:22.769> under

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
because one of his air defense is under

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.039 
because one of his air defense is under
construction<00:03:23.430> when<00:03:24.150> I'm<00:03:24.239> using<00:03:24.359> dragons<00:03:24.870> at

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
construction when I'm using dragons at

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.229 
construction when I'm using dragons at
townhall<00:03:25.500> 8<00:03:25.530> I<00:03:25.920> try<00:03:26.340> to<00:03:26.400> look<00:03:26.579> for<00:03:26.609> bases<00:03:27.090> that

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
townhall 8 I try to look for bases that

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.150 
townhall 8 I try to look for bases that
have<00:03:27.299> only<00:03:27.660> two<00:03:27.989> air<00:03:28.170> defense<00:03:28.470> available<00:03:29.010> or

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
have only two air defense available or

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.559 
have only two air defense available or
maybe<00:03:29.370> one<00:03:29.579> of<00:03:29.670> them's<00:03:29.850> extremely<00:03:30.329> out<00:03:30.480> of

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
maybe one of them's extremely out of

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.390 
maybe one of them's extremely out of
position<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.049> for<00:03:31.230> this<00:03:31.350> guy<00:03:31.530> he<00:03:32.040> had<00:03:32.160> three

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
position and for this guy he had three

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.920 
position and for this guy he had three
air<00:03:32.549> defense<00:03:32.850> but<00:03:33.060> one<00:03:33.299> was<00:03:33.569> under

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
air defense but one was under

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.840 
air defense but one was under
construction<00:03:34.280> which<00:03:35.280> means<00:03:35.489> I<00:03:35.579> don't<00:03:35.640> have<00:03:35.730> to

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
construction which means I don't have to

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.400 
construction which means I don't have to
worry<00:03:36.060> about<00:03:36.180> that<00:03:36.480> and<00:03:36.690> they<00:03:36.810> went<00:03:36.989> ahead<00:03:37.049> and

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
worry about that and they went ahead and

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.710 
worry about that and they went ahead and
shot<00:03:37.680> that<00:03:37.859> down<00:03:38.100> right<00:03:38.370> now<00:03:38.549> so<00:03:38.579> looks<00:03:39.540> like

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
shot that down right now so looks like

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.150 
shot that down right now so looks like
his<00:03:39.870> hairdryers<00:03:40.319> gonna<00:03:40.620> try<00:03:40.769> to<00:03:40.829> push<00:03:41.010> my

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
his hairdryers gonna try to push my

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.530 
his hairdryers gonna try to push my
dragons<00:03:41.519> out<00:03:41.639> of<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:41.819> way<00:03:41.910> not<00:03:42.150> gonna<00:03:42.329> play

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
dragons out of the way not gonna play

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.300 
dragons out of the way not gonna play
too<00:03:42.600> much<00:03:42.930> of<00:03:43.139> a<00:03:43.230> role<00:03:43.410> in<00:03:43.590> this<00:03:43.769> raid<00:03:44.010> and

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
too much of a role in this raid and

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.860 
too much of a role in this raid and
we're<00:03:44.519> gonna<00:03:44.639> start<00:03:44.880> to<00:03:44.970> get<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.180> juicy<00:03:45.660> part

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
we're gonna start to get the juicy part

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.020 
we're gonna start to get the juicy part
of<00:03:45.989> the<00:03:46.079> storages<00:03:46.709> and<00:03:46.950> that's<00:03:47.579> definitely

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
of the storages and that's definitely

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.220 
of the storages and that's definitely
the<00:03:48.120> best<00:03:48.239> part<00:03:48.510> of<00:03:48.569> the<00:03:48.660> raid<00:03:48.810> and<00:03:49.049> we're

slowly<00:04:18.870> dwindling<00:04:19.470> as<00:04:19.620> we<00:04:19.739> attack<00:04:19.979> the<00:04:20.130> gold

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280
