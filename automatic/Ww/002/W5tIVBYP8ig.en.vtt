00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
for the leaves so you can test on a

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.890 
for the leaves so you can test on a
piece<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.699> paper<00:00:26.849> i<00:00:27.210> always<00:00:27.449> give<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.630> piece<00:00:27.840> of

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
piece of paper i always give a piece of

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.209 
piece of paper i always give a piece of
paper<00:00:28.170> at<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.439> side<00:00:28.710> just<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:29.099> see<00:00:29.869> how<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:30.900> is

00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:31.219 
paper at the side just to see how it is

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:33.500 
paper at the side just to see how it is
okay<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:32.279> beginning<00:00:32.790> with<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.030> tree<00:00:33.329> on<00:00:33.480> the

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
okay so beginning with the tree on the

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.549 
okay so beginning with the tree on the
right<00:00:34.790> you<00:00:35.790> just<00:00:36.120> because<00:00:36.809> your<00:00:36.960> sky<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.230> dry

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
right you just because your sky is dry

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:45.100 
right you just because your sky is dry
you<00:00:38.989> can<00:00:39.989> put<00:00:40.469> in

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.230 

and<00:00:45.260> I'm<00:00:45.830> not<00:00:46.010> trying<00:00:46.190> to<00:00:46.370> make<00:00:46.580> this<00:00:46.640> exact

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:47.240 
and I'm not trying to make this exact

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.170 
and I'm not trying to make this exact
again<00:00:47.630> I'm<00:00:47.750> just<00:00:48.250> it's<00:00:49.250> the<00:00:49.610> general

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
again I'm just it's the general

00:00:50.180 --> 00:01:07.890 
again I'm just it's the general
impression<00:00:50.950> you<00:00:51.950> can<00:00:52.190> dip<00:00:52.400> into<00:00:52.580> the<00:00:52.760> water

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.840 

now<00:01:08.500> I'm<00:01:08.620> coming<00:01:08.950> into<00:01:09.190> the<00:01:09.310> area<00:01:09.490> that's

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
now I'm coming into the area that's

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.530 
now I'm coming into the area that's
going<00:01:09.940> to<00:01:10.300> be<00:01:11.070> writing<00:01:12.070> so<00:01:12.970> I'll<00:01:13.090> just<00:01:13.150> carry

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
just drop it in there while the paint's

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:49.040

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.270 

ok<00:01:49.820> now<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.880> tree<00:01:51.180> on<00:01:51.330> the<00:01:51.390> other<00:01:51.570> side<00:01:51.900> I<00:01:52.280> have

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
ok now the tree on the other side I have

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.450 
ok now the tree on the other side I have
some<00:01:53.610> branches<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.680> a<00:01:55.680> tree<00:01:55.920> trunk<00:01:56.190> so<00:01:56.400> i'm

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
some branches and a tree trunk so i'm

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.630 
some branches and a tree trunk so i'm
going<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.670> put<00:01:56.730> those<00:01:57.030> in<00:01:57.300> first<00:01:58.250> but<00:01:59.250> keep<00:01:59.460> it

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
going to put those in first but keep it

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:13.340 
going to put those in first but keep it
pretty<00:01:59.820> wet

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.230 

and<00:02:13.590> if<00:02:14.130> you<00:02:14.220> don't<00:02:14.460> like<00:02:14.700> quite<00:02:15.030> where

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
and if you don't like quite where

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.550 
and if you don't like quite where
something<00:02:15.720> is<00:02:15.840> or<00:02:16.020> if<00:02:16.080> there<00:02:16.200> was<00:02:16.290> another

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
something is or if there was another

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.220 
something is or if there was another
tree<00:02:16.830> in<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.070> middle<00:02:17.190> I<00:02:18.180> wouldn't<00:02:18.870> put<00:02:19.050> it<00:02:19.080> in

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
tree in the middle I wouldn't put it in

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.320 
tree in the middle I wouldn't put it in
because<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:19.710> would<00:02:19.800> it<00:02:20.790> just<00:02:21.030> wouldn't<00:02:21.210> look

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
because it would it just wouldn't look

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:37.080 
because it would it just wouldn't look
balanced

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:44.450 

coming<00:02:38.090> into<00:02:38.269> my<00:02:38.390> green

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.910 

to<00:02:44.910> do<00:02:45.060> it<00:02:45.180> while<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:46.170> brown<00:02:46.410> is<00:02:46.620> still<00:02:46.890> wet

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.830 

so<00:02:50.520> that<00:02:50.700> they<00:02:50.819> blend<00:02:51.180> they'll<00:02:51.450> run<00:02:51.660> together

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
so that they blend they'll run together

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.530 
so that they blend they'll run together
on<00:02:52.200> their<00:02:52.380> own
