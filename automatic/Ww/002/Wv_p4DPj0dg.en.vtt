00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.700
*Intro Music*

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.400
Sarge: Come on, double time, men. That goes double for you Grif.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.340
Grif: Why are we always double timing anyway? Can't we ever half time? Or how about no time?

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:16.140
Sarge: No, numbnuts. According to Simmons, the blues have already reestablished contact with their command!

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.140
Grif: What? That's why we're running?

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:25.220
Sarge: Of course! By now, they could be receiving reinforcements! Or taking advantage of some new, technological weapons development!

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.640
Grif: Or maybe their command has been giving them the same, generic orders ours always gives us, like,

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.580
"Try to win!" and "Do better than you're currently doing!"

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.040
I swear, sometimes I think they don't even know our names.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.060
Sarge: That's just what I wanted you to hear. The conversations I had with command always provided vital intelligence!

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.560
Grif: Like what?

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.380
Sarge: Like the location of the blue base!

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.540
Grif: Right there.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.060
Sarge: And the number of soldiers they have.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.840
Grif: Three.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.000
Sarge: Also, the location of the base!

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.640
Grif: Ah, you already said that one.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.820
Sarge: I meant our base.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.740
Simmons: Weren't we the ones that provided them the intel in the first place?

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.700
Sarge: Initially, yes, but command processes the raw data and gives us back the key details.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.500
You may recall they sent us plans for the next phase of the war.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.600
They were stored in Lopez before he was kidnapped.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.640
Grif: You mean before he ran away.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.480
Sarge: No, I mean SHUT UP, GRIF!

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.020
Simmons: But how do we even know he still has the plans? Last time we saw him, all that was left was a head.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.720
Maybe he stored the files in his legs, or his chest.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.480
Sarge: You idiot, who stores memories in their chest? Don't you know anything about biology?

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.580
The chest is strictly reserved for digestion.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.120
Grif: Maybe they'll send us more reinforcements like last time.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.720
Donut's arrival was a real turning point in the offensive.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.780
Sarge: Where is Donut?

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.040
Simmons: There he is! Looks like he's talking to something.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.040
Sarge: Looks like a rock. Grif!

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.540
Grif: What?

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.600
Sarge: I need information on that rock, ASAP. Approach the target via flanking maneuver and establish defilade to that ledge.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.380
Point Alpha!

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.880
Grif: Or I could just look through the scope of the sniper rifle since that's worked the last eight hundred times.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.720
Sarge: Yeah, alright, fine. Take all the fun out of it.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.520
I like my way better. It was more dangerous for you.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.940
Grif: Sarge, I have great news. Looks like you're going to get your plans after all.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.560
And I'm not going to have to do anymore running, so everybody wins.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.060
Simmons: What about me? I didn't win anything.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.600
Grif: Oh, don't worry about it, I'm sure there will be somebody's ass you can kiss.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.380
Church: Andy, this is Doc. Doc, this is Andy.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.880
Uh, Andy, Doc is here to help Tucker. And he's also our worst enemy.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.720
Well, you know, besides the Reds. And Tex on certain days.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.300
O'Malley: Well, thank you for introducing me to your bowling ball.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.020
Hello, bowling ball.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.440
Andy: Actually, I'm a bomb.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.880
O'Malley: It can talk?

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.980
Andy: Why is that the first thing everybody says to me?

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.580
O'Malley: A talking bomb, you say? Hm, I could use a fellow like you in my organization.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.400
Church: Yeah.. I should probably point out that Andy was specifically designed to blow up and kill you.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.560
O'Malley: I see...

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.680
Well this is certainly awkward.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.060
Andy: KABOOM!!

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.980
O'Malley: SATAN'S FUNYANS

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.760
Andy: *laughing* I was just kidding...

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.220
I didn't really explode.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.800
O'Malley: Haha, good one. Yes... highly amusing.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.260
Sarge: LOPEZ? Donut, where did you find him?

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.920
Donut: Right here.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.660
Simmons: How were you two talking? Lopez, you speak English now?

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.980
Grif: Well if he doesn't, why did he just say "no" in English?

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.140
Busted!

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.300
Donut: I took four years of high school Spanish.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.140
That's the best way to learn any language.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.740
Sarge: What have you two been talking about?

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.920
Donut: Oh, the usual Spanish fare.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.200
I told him my name.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.100
I asked him what his name was.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.380
I asked if he knew where the bathroom was,

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.120
how much a ticket for the train cost,

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.580
and I asked him for the check.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.360
Sarge: Ask him where he's been. No! Ask him where he's going! Wait! Ask him if he has our secret plans.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:28.500
and if he missed me.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.020
Donut: Adios!

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.040
Hmm... looks like he's not talking, Sarge.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.480
Sarge: Alright, he wants to play tough, huh?

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.940
I built in an override code for just this event.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.560
LOPEZ! Give me root access. Priority: Delta One.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.300
Sarge: The access code is...

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:01.940
access code.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.600
Simmons: Oh, you've got to be fucking kidding me.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.960
Sarge: Ah, bitch about it later.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.160
Sarge: Lopez, replay the intel message from command.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.900
Grif: SEE! "OK." I'm telling you, this guy's faking.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.440
Grif: OH, come on. The recording is in Spanish?! That doesn't even make any sense!

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.800
Simmons: This guy sounds just like the guy the Blues were talking to. Vic Jr.! I bet his kids changed sides.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.640
Sarge: Eggs Benedict Arnold! Those dirty traitors!

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.080
...no offense Simmons.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.140
Simmons: None taken, sir.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.800
Sarge: Traitor.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.300
Simmons: Goddamnit.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.480
Donut: Wait... how did Vic have kids? I thought he had a vasectomy.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.700
Well that's just what I heard!

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.780
Sarge: We've got to figure out what he's saying!

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.780
Donut, can you translate or can't you?

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.800
Donut: Uhh, I think he's saying something about losing his passport.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.360
Simmons: Well, when I was in blue base, Church mentioned that they built a translation device out of an old bomb.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.300
Sarge: No doubt to decipher their plans to destroy us!

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.740
If we don't translate the tactical plans that Lopez is saying,

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.260
we're all doomed!

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.140
Sarge: That information can save our very lives!

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.120
Simmons: Why don't we sneak into blue base, steal the translation device, and use it on our message.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.040
Sarge: I agree.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.140
Grif: Let me get this straight, we're going to steal a bomb from our enemies.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.580
A bomb that can be remotely detonated I might add.

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.420
And then we're going to bring it back to our base, and all huddle around it.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:34.980
Grif: What a great plan!

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.360
Simmons: Well, sure, it sounds stupid when you say it like that.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.700
Sarge: Come on, let's move. Somebody grab Lopez's cabesa.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.120
Donut: Of course!

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.160
Sarge: That's not the cabesa, Donut.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.820
And that's not Lopez!

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.840
Simmons in Outro: Hello everyone, now that we have our own Youtube channel,

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.440
I've taken the liberty of reorganizing everything for a streamline, unioned experience.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.560
Just hit subscribe to put it to use!

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.120
Grif (offscreen): You're supposed to convince them to subscribe, not put them to sleep! Loser.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.020
Simmons: Ugh, I hate him so much.
