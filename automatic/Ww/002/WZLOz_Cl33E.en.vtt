00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
pattern in 68 time which means they're

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.740 
pattern in 68 time which means they're
going<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.710> be<00:00:31.800> six<00:00:32.189> beats<00:00:32.700> per<00:00:33.000> measure<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.510> an

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
way you would actually count it now

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:08.140 
way you would actually count it now

00:06:33.649 --> 00:06:33.659 
one and then oh yeah one more thing the

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:35.239

reason<00:06:33.899> it's<00:06:34.019> called<00:06:34.050> a<00:06:34.229> quick<00:06:34.439> term<00:06:34.619> blues<00:06:34.919> is

00:06:35.239 --> 00:06:35.249 
reason it's called a quick term blues is

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:37.670 
reason it's called a quick term blues is
because<00:06:35.490> normally<00:06:35.999> in<00:06:36.389> a<00:06:36.779> 12<00:06:37.050> bar<00:06:37.169> blues<00:06:37.229> you

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 
because normally in a 12 bar blues you

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.379 
because normally in a 12 bar blues you
don't<00:06:37.829> have<00:06:37.979> the<00:06:38.099> four<00:06:38.339> chord<00:06:38.639> until<00:06:39.089> about

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:39.389 
don't have the four chord until about

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:42.170 
don't have the four chord until about
the<00:06:39.689> fifth<00:06:40.019> measure<00:06:40.259> or<00:06:40.529> something<00:06:40.919> but<00:06:41.879> this

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:42.180 
the fifth measure or something but this

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.999 
the fifth measure or something but this
you'll<00:06:42.479> know<00:06:42.659> the<00:06:42.959> fourth<00:06:43.259> court<00:06:43.589> the<00:06:43.800> four

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:44.009 
you'll know the fourth court the four

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:46.369 
you'll know the fourth court the four
chord<00:06:44.279> which<00:06:44.459> is<00:06:44.579> E<00:06:44.699> flat<00:06:44.729> nine<00:06:45.149> it<00:06:45.959> actually

00:06:46.369 --> 00:06:46.379 
chord which is E flat nine it actually

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:55.180 
chord which is E flat nine it actually
comes<00:06:46.559> in<00:06:46.829> on<00:06:47.039> the<00:06:47.099> second<00:06:47.669> bar<00:06:47.849> so<00:06:48.149> I<00:06:48.209> go

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:55.190 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:57.070 

you<00:06:55.280> see<00:06:56.030> that<00:06:56.210> that's<00:06:56.480> called<00:06:56.630> a<00:06:56.690> quick<00:06:56.900> turn

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:57.080 
you see that that's called a quick turn

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:07.710 
you see that that's called a quick turn
blue<00:06:57.350> normally<00:06:58.250> it<00:06:58.310> would<00:06:58.400> just<00:06:58.460> be<00:06:58.610> like<00:06:58.640> this

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:07.720 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.150 

but<00:07:08.720> in<00:07:08.810> this<00:07:08.900> case<00:07:09.140> it<00:07:09.410> actually<00:07:09.500> quick<00:07:09.920> turn

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 
but in this case it actually quick turn

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.310 
but in this case it actually quick turn
so<00:07:10.520> it<00:07:10.940> jumps<00:07:11.150> to<00:07:11.240> that<00:07:11.420> four<00:07:11.690> chord<00:07:11.960> real

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:12.320 
so it jumps to that four chord real

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:18.970 
so it jumps to that four chord real
quick

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:18.980 

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.630 

and<00:07:19.940> that's<00:07:20.090> about<00:07:20.210> it<00:07:20.860> cool<00:07:21.860> so<00:07:22.160> if<00:07:22.310> you<00:07:22.430> liked
