00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.419 
it is one it comes in its own aluminum
case<00:00:12.599> so<00:00:13.440> it<00:00:13.559> protects<00:00:13.950> it<00:00:14.099> from<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.309> elements

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
case so it protects it from the elements

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.120 
case so it protects it from the elements
this<00:00:14.790> is<00:00:14.849> great<00:00:15.240> if<00:00:15.480> you're<00:00:15.990> just<00:00:16.170> in<00:00:17.010> a

the elements what's great about that is
a<00:00:27.029> lot<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.449> times<00:00:27.779> most<00:00:28.439> fire<00:00:28.710> starters<00:00:29.160> out

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
a lot of times most fire starters out

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.009 
a lot of times most fire starters out
there<00:00:29.519> can<00:00:29.699> be<00:00:29.730> easily<00:00:30.029> eaten<00:00:30.570> away<00:00:30.660> in<00:00:30.929> a
