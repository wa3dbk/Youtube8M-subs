olestra<00:03:31.790> flaw<00:03:33.490> here<00:03:34.490> is<00:03:34.610> the<00:03:34.790> initial<00:03:35.240> start

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
olestra flaw here is the initial start

00:03:35.630 --> 00:04:57.280 
olestra flaw here is the initial start
after<00:03:36.020> the<00:03:36.500> transmission<00:03:36.950> installation

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.360 

so<00:04:58.290> man<00:04:58.500> the<00:04:59.430> truck<00:04:59.640> didn't<00:04:59.940> go<00:05:00.570> into<00:05:00.720> gear

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370
