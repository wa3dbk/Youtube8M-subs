00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
we've we've done a lot of testing just

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.580 
we've we've done a lot of testing just
as<00:00:47.770> tracks<00:00:48.770> and<00:00:49.340> and<00:00:50.320> conditions<00:00:51.320> that<00:00:51.469> we

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
as tracks and and conditions that we

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.479 
as tracks and and conditions that we
race<00:00:51.800> and<00:00:52.070> have<00:00:52.160> kind<00:00:52.340> of<00:00:52.460> evolved

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.850 

with<00:00:58.059> a<00:00:58.090> 3.0<00:00:58.840> we're<00:00:59.200> able<00:00:59.320> to<00:00:59.649> to<00:01:00.430> tune<00:01:00.700> for

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
with a 3.0 we're able to to tune for

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.690 
with a 3.0 we're able to to tune for
more<00:01:02.860> diverse<00:01:04.560> types<00:01:05.560> of<00:01:05.710> tracks<00:01:05.979> so<00:01:06.490> whether

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
more diverse types of tracks so whether

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.330 
more diverse types of tracks so whether
it's<00:01:06.909> in<00:01:07.030> the<00:01:07.090> US<00:01:07.270> or<00:01:07.750> Europe<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:09.130> higher

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
it's in the US or Europe the higher

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.880 
it's in the US or Europe the higher
speed<00:01:09.729> tracks<00:01:10.090> the<00:01:10.330> higher<00:01:10.509> grip<00:01:10.840> tracks<00:01:11.200> we

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
speed tracks the higher grip tracks we

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.560 
speed tracks the higher grip tracks we
get<00:01:12.040> still<00:01:12.369> have<00:01:12.549> the<00:01:12.759> kind<00:01:12.970> of<00:01:13.030> light<00:01:13.240> nimble

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
get still have the kind of light nimble

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.649 
get still have the kind of light nimble
feel<00:01:13.960> for<00:01:14.380> the<00:01:14.440> u.s.<00:01:14.740> style<00:01:14.979> tracks<00:01:15.659> so

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
feel for the u.s. style tracks so

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:17.850 
feel for the u.s. style tracks so
overall<00:01:17.050> I<00:01:17.080> think<00:01:17.259> it's<00:01:17.470> going<00:01:17.680> to<00:01:17.740> be<00:01:17.830> a

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
overall I think it's going to be a

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.190 
overall I think it's going to be a
really<00:01:18.070> great<00:01:18.280> package<00:01:18.820> that<00:01:19.119> the<00:01:19.720> consumers

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
really great package that the consumers

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.130 
really great package that the consumers
are<00:01:20.350> very<00:01:20.380> happy<00:01:20.680> with<00:01:24.600> for<00:01:25.600> the<00:01:25.690> racers<00:01:25.990> with

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
are very happy with for the racers with

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.649 
are very happy with for the racers with
a<00:01:26.259> 3.0<00:01:26.800> we<00:01:27.009> wanted<00:01:27.340> to<00:01:27.850> develop<00:01:28.060> a<00:01:28.270> car<00:01:28.450> that's

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
a 3.0 we wanted to develop a car that's

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.620 
a 3.0 we wanted to develop a car that's
a<00:01:28.840> dynamic<00:01:29.140> as<00:01:29.530> the<00:01:29.679> a<00:01:29.950> 2.0<00:01:30.580> but<00:01:30.970> yet<00:01:31.119> easier<00:01:31.479> to

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
a dynamic as the a 2.0 but yet easier to

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.370 
a dynamic as the a 2.0 but yet easier to
drive<00:01:31.869> and<00:01:32.619> we<00:01:33.039> feel<00:01:33.250> like<00:01:33.280> we've<00:01:33.610> definitely

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
drive and we feel like we've definitely

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:49.680 
drive and we feel like we've definitely
hit<00:01:35.380> that<00:01:35.410> mark<00:01:35.830> with<00:01:35.979> a<00:01:36.009> 3.0
