Geekbench free and the cons into their
website<00:00:10.170> they<00:00:10.200> have<00:00:10.410> started<00:00:10.889> from<00:00:11.070> scratch

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
website they have started from scratch

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.400 
website they have started from scratch
and<00:00:11.730> made<00:00:11.969> a<00:00:12.000> completely<00:00:12.480> new<00:00:12.809> processor

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
and made a completely new processor

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.140 
and made a completely new processor
benchmark<00:00:13.920> which<00:00:14.099> is<00:00:14.250> more<00:00:14.429> accurate<00:00:14.670> and

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
benchmark which is more accurate and

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.599 
benchmark which is more accurate and
tests<00:00:15.660> real-world<00:00:16.109> scenarios<00:00:16.800> but

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
tests real-world scenarios but

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.010 
tests real-world scenarios but
unfortunately<00:00:18.300> if<00:00:18.480> you<00:00:18.630> have<00:00:18.810> bought<00:00:18.990> a

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
unfortunately if you have bought a

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.840 
unfortunately if you have bought a
license<00:00:19.500> for<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.710> big<00:00:19.920> wrench<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.369> it's<00:00:20.640> not

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
license for a big wrench to it's not

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.880 
license for a big wrench to it's not
valid<00:00:21.240> for<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.480> third<00:00:21.689> version<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.350> you'll

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
valid for the third version and you'll

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.950 
valid for the third version and you'll
probably<00:00:23.189> have<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.550> buy<00:00:23.910> it<00:00:23.970> which<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.660> really

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
probably have to buy it which is really

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.189 
probably have to buy it which is really
painted<00:00:25.410> s4s<00:00:26.189> users<00:00:26.849> because<00:00:27.570> not<00:00:27.810> everyone

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
painted s4s users because not everyone

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.189 
painted s4s users because not everyone
likes<00:00:28.439> lucky<00:00:28.890> jailbreak<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.849> now<00:00:30.750> I'll<00:00:30.960> have

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
likes lucky jailbreak and now I'll have

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.520 
likes lucky jailbreak and now I'll have
to<00:00:31.230> buy<00:00:31.500> this<00:00:31.560> bitch<00:00:31.920> again<00:00:32.840> I'm<00:00:33.840> so<00:00:34.320> let's

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
to buy this bitch again I'm so let's

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.480 
to buy this bitch again I'm so let's
start<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:34.980> have<00:00:35.160> cleared<00:00:35.460> my<00:00:35.670> ram

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:41.490 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.060 

what<00:00:42.000> which<00:00:42.150> runs<00:00:42.390> really<00:00:42.840> smooth<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.590> really

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
what which runs really smooth I really

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.300 
what which runs really smooth I really
appreciate<00:00:44.130> some<00:00:44.460> Funimation<00:00:45.240> and<00:00:46.280> now<00:00:47.280> I

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.310 
appreciate some Funimation and now I

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.830 
appreciate some Funimation and now I
think<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.730> will<00:00:47.820> take<00:00:47.880> a<00:00:48.240> little<00:00:48.450> bit<00:00:48.600> to

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
think it will take a little bit to

00:00:48.840 --> 00:01:09.260 
think it will take a little bit to
finish

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.470 

so<00:01:10.270> I<00:01:10.300> got<00:01:11.130> 392<00:01:12.130> multi-core<00:01:12.760> score<00:01:12.940> but

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:13.480 
so I got 392 multi-core score but

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.390 
so I got 392 multi-core score but
actually<00:01:14.080> don't<00:01:14.500> compare<00:01:14.920> to<00:01:14.950> the<00:01:15.160> old

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
actually don't compare to the old

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.340 
actually don't compare to the old
geekbench<00:01:15.940> because<00:01:16.450> it<00:01:16.630> has<00:01:16.810> a<00:01:16.840> brand-new

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
geekbench because it has a brand-new

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.680 
geekbench because it has a brand-new
scoring<00:01:17.830> system<00:01:18.250> and<00:01:18.460> if<00:01:19.060> you<00:01:19.180> didn't<00:01:19.480> know

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
scoring system and if you didn't know

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.320 
scoring system and if you didn't know
the<00:01:20.140> old<00:01:20.320> geekbench<00:01:20.770> used<00:01:21.070> 1000<00:01:21.850> scroll<00:01:22.090> as<00:01:22.300> a

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
the old geekbench used 1000 scroll as a

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.070 
the old geekbench used 1000 scroll as a
basic<00:01:22.870> performance<00:01:23.200> of<00:01:23.800> a<00:01:24.580> powermac<00:01:25.000> g5<00:01:25.420> SI<00:01:25.810> as

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
basic performance of a powermac g5 SI as

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.520 
basic performance of a powermac g5 SI as
far<00:01:26.320> as<00:01:26.380> i<00:01:26.500> remember<00:01:26.610> which<00:01:27.610> was<00:01:27.850> produced<00:01:28.120> in

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
far as i remember which was produced in

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.080 
far as i remember which was produced in
2003<00:01:29.530> so<00:01:29.800> everything<00:01:30.340> was<00:01:30.580> campaigned

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
2003 so everything was campaigned

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.710 
2003 so everything was campaigned
against<00:01:31.840> 10<00:01:32.170> year<00:01:32.320> old<00:01:32.530> Mac<00:01:32.860> but<00:01:33.820> now<00:01:34.360> I<00:01:34.390> think

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
against 10 year old Mac but now I think

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.570 
against 10 year old Mac but now I think
it<00:01:34.840> will<00:01:34.960> take<00:01:35.020> some<00:01:35.380> time<00:01:35.440> for<00:01:35.860> me<00:01:36.280> to<00:01:36.430> get

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
it will take some time for me to get

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.969 
it will take some time for me to get
used<00:01:36.850> to<00:01:37.060> the<00:01:37.180> new<00:01:37.360> scoring<00:01:37.840> system<00:01:38.260> because<00:01:38.830> i

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
used to the new scoring system because i

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.219 
used to the new scoring system because i
have<00:01:39.160> tried<00:01:39.400> to<00:01:39.430> run<00:01:39.700> this<00:01:39.760> on<00:01:40.150> an<00:01:40.270> ipad<00:01:40.630> 4<00:01:40.960> and

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
have tried to run this on an ipad 4 and

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.330 
have tried to run this on an ipad 4 and
it<00:01:41.680> turns<00:01:41.920> out<00:01:42.160> that<00:01:42.220> the<00:01:42.580> iphone<00:01:43.030> 4s<00:01:43.450> is<00:01:44.340> 3.6

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
it turns out that the iphone 4s is 3.6

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.670 
it turns out that the iphone 4s is 3.6
times<00:01:45.670> slower<00:01:46.000> than<00:01:46.180> it<00:01:46.510> in<00:01:46.750> the<00:01:47.320> new<00:01:47.440> gig

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
times slower than it in the new gig

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.770 
times slower than it in the new gig
bench<00:01:47.920> and<00:01:48.220> in<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:48.790> old<00:01:48.910> geekbench<00:01:49.360> it<00:01:49.600> was

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
bench and in the old geekbench it was

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.530 
bench and in the old geekbench it was
2.8<00:01:50.440> times<00:01:50.470> slower<00:01:51.100> so<00:01:51.910> as<00:01:52.210> i<00:01:52.240> have<00:01:52.509> mentioned

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
2.8 times slower so as i have mentioned

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.600 
2.8 times slower so as i have mentioned
before<00:01:52.990> now<00:01:53.410> we<00:01:53.470> have<00:01:53.830> to<00:01:54.009> spend<00:01:54.190> some<00:01:54.430> time

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
before now we have to spend some time

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.640 
before now we have to spend some time
messing<00:01:55.119> around<00:01:55.240> a<00:01:55.570> bit<00:01:55.720> to<00:01:55.750> get<00:01:56.080> used<00:01:56.140> and

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
messing around a bit to get used and

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.890 
messing around a bit to get used and
thanks<00:01:57.640> for<00:01:57.790> watching<00:01:57.820> guys<00:01:58.119> I<00:01:58.570> hope<00:01:58.600> you

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900
