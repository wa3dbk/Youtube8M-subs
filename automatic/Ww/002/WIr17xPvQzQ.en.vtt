00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
simultaneously now what would happen was

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.210 
simultaneously now what would happen was
i<00:02:31.870> don't<00:02:32.020> know<00:02:32.080> if<00:02:32.170> my<00:02:32.200> computers<00:02:32.710> like<00:02:33.010> was

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
i don't know if my computers like was

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.710 
i don't know if my computers like was
just<00:02:33.370> being<00:02:33.520> a<00:02:33.610> douchebag<00:02:34.030> referred<00:02:34.480> my<00:02:34.660> it

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
just being a douchebag referred my it

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
just being a douchebag referred my it
was<00:02:34.900> my<00:02:35.050> PVR<00:02:35.470> which<00:02:35.800> it<00:02:36.010> was<00:02:36.250> um<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:38.170> PGR<00:02:38.560> would

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
was my PVR which it was um the PGR would

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.680 
was my PVR which it was um the PGR would
skip<00:02:39.040> so<00:02:39.700> it<00:02:39.790> would<00:02:39.880> stop<00:02:40.090> recording<00:02:40.360> for<00:02:40.660> a

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
skip so it would stop recording for a

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.960 
skip so it would stop recording for a
second<00:02:41.080> and<00:02:41.200> then<00:02:41.590> continue<00:02:42.070> so<00:02:42.490> it<00:02:42.850> would

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
second and then continue so it would

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.490 
second and then continue so it would
lose<00:02:43.180> that<00:02:43.330> second<00:02:43.810> of<00:02:43.870> footage<00:02:44.020> and<00:02:44.320> it<00:02:44.410> would

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
lose that second of footage and it would

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.070 
lose that second of footage and it would
do<00:02:44.680> that<00:02:44.860> like<00:02:45.430> every<00:02:46.090> 10<00:02:46.360> seconds<00:02:46.840> of<00:02:46.960> the

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
do that like every 10 seconds of the

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.470 
do that like every 10 seconds of the
video<00:02:47.200> so<00:02:47.650> just<00:02:48.310> think<00:02:48.700> about<00:02:48.760> that<00:02:48.910> for<00:02:49.090> a<00:02:49.300> sec

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
video so just think about that for a sec

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.360 
video so just think about that for a sec
in<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:50.050> end<00:02:50.200> I<00:02:50.410> have<00:02:50.560> two<00:02:50.860> different<00:02:51.100> sized

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
in the end I have two different sized

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.310 
in the end I have two different sized
files<00:02:51.670> one<00:02:52.270> for<00:02:52.450> my<00:02:52.540> commentary<00:02:52.990> which<00:02:53.110> may<00:02:53.260> be

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
files one for my commentary which may be

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.860 
files one for my commentary which may be
30<00:02:53.590> minutes<00:02:53.800> long<00:02:54.040> and<00:02:54.190> one<00:02:54.700> for<00:02:54.910> my<00:02:55.060> actual

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
30 minutes long and one for my actual

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.340 
30 minutes long and one for my actual
gameplay<00:02:56.080> which<00:02:56.380> may<00:02:56.530> be<00:02:56.560> 28<00:02:57.520> minutes<00:02:57.790> long<00:02:58.000> so

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
gameplay which may be 28 minutes long so

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.600 
gameplay which may be 28 minutes long so
just<00:02:59.350> think<00:02:59.500> of<00:02:59.560> how<00:02:59.770> many<00:02:59.830> parts<00:03:00.220> i<00:03:00.310> have<00:03:00.460> to

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
just think of how many parts i have to

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.300 
just think of how many parts i have to
cut<00:03:00.880> just<00:03:01.480> to<00:03:01.600> sync<00:03:01.960> it<00:03:02.020> perfectly<00:03:02.470> it's<00:03:03.040> not

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310
