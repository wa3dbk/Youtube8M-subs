00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 after the images shown on the day 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.700
 yesterday in mega news in which a 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.200
 consumer publicly denounced that the 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.480
 gas station located in gómez farías and 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.960
 bravo supposedly do not ship liters 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.519
 complete this the cava of every 200 pesos 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.410
 of the truth 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.760
 is less than 10 should do 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.760
 up 20 liters no 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:24.509
 because 17 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.960
 replenish us in the thread 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.370
 today we go with the motorists 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.960
 who say you have to hit him 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.410
 the gas station that gives you the liters 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.870
 since it is wrong and it already raises 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.790
 enough an hour to grab the 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.290
 money and all that business and so that you 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.320
 steal still in gasoline as it is 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.930
 bitchy, we do not even know when 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.900
 you're going and it's already different no longer 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.540
 you can calculate 100 pesos 200 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.489
 weights are no longer the 20 liters and do not 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.930
 you know that you have to throw to the 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.360
 gas station that really gives you more 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.039
 liters so you 're paying calls the 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.780
 citizenship the federal attorney's office 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:12.000
 profeco consumer to put greater 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.789
 Attention to these commercial turns and 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.800
 sanction with all the rigor of the law 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:19.320
 Well, I imagine that more vigilance is not 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.480
 part of the prophecy that is responsible for 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.990
 those consumers 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.330
 is some government device that 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.200
 be exact 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.550
 the exact with the ready that go but not 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.800
 that's just the price of gas 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.810
 that is constantly changing there 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.850
 some that if there are gas stations of peace 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.820
 that give you one hundred percent those that 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.980
 they are for the shot over there and they are 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.810
 wash alone and so there are gas stations here and 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.900
 Achilles will be that if they give you one hundred 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.030
 cent but there are others that do not surrender 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.100
 In this regard the delegate of the prophecy 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.870
 Claudia Méndez Vargas informed that the 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.850
 dependence at the local level and offices 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.440
 central banks carry out an operation of 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.540
 verification and monitoring at gas stations 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.240
 of the state precisely in the task of 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.250
 verification of getting to inspect the 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.650
 the gas stations see if they are giving 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.380
 full liters is what offices do 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.930
 central that is a faculty this of the 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.600
 Deputy Attorney General's Office 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.260
 precisely what we do is 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.000
 the calibration is to say that your 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.130
 gas pumps all 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.760
 measuring instruments are 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:28.310
 correctly we do the homework 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.930
 in delegations however he said that 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.120
 despite the calibrations of the pumps 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.099
 of gasoline are not exempt 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.140
 altered invited the population to 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:40.250
 report any disagreement 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.530
 If there are any, there are some 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.989
 10 I believe initiates of those who have 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.150
 touched check because as they go be 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.980
 initiating procedure we turn to 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.159
 we this federal criminal is 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.409
 typified the theft of gasoline and state 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:56.629
 which is a somewhat recent issue 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:58.579
 then they can file the complaint 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.049
 with us we turn it to 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:02.239
 mexico to be done with 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.940
 Subsequent verification but 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.950
 You can also go to the offices of 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.870
 the Attorney General of this 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.459
 republic with the public denunciation of the 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.470
 gas station the population is expected 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.980
 go to the prophecy to denounce this type 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:19.840
 of abuses so that they end up with 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.840
