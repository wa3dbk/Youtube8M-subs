00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello randfiguren welcome to 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.960
 a brand new video and that I am 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.960
 just got pretty startled as me 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.599
 I read the articles about that 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:15.240
 From now on officially slow carb 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:19.770
 land is the first in the western 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.840
 nations, ie western countries and 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.090
 though that's pretty remarkable because 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.619
 the national recommendations for consumption 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.740
 what's with us in germany ge 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:32.000
 Power is almost all of these 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.040
 western countries industrial nations etc 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.140
 on a full world nutrition yes many 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.140
 complex carbohydrates and so on and 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.300
 little fat and the sweden have it 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.059
 now converted yes the create order 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.190
 low carb so less carbohydrates and 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.559
 I find a lot more healthy fats 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.219
 interesting and remarkable there are 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.309
 still some Eckdaten indicated with the 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.989
 For example, here I have a total of 16,000 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.090
 have evaluated studies 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.600
 although I'm not sure if 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.880
 The impression is a lot of ice and the 16,000 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.100
 people said or 16000 studies no 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.810
 idea what I found at only interesting 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:15.450
 the whole thing is that so slowly 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.640
 this myth is fat because of it 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.210
 unhealthy and so on to crumble 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.590
 seems like what I think is pretty cool 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.979
 On the other hand, what I do not like so much 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.200
 is that in general we say 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.430
 nation or we as a society 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:35.909
 the national recommendations for for 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.130
 wanting to keep eating 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.290
 recommend the low carb diet or us 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.119
 recommend the low fat diet or us 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.780
 recommend that and that are these 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.790
 Nutrition because I am my low carb yes 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.390
 that's why it's so effective or just 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.450
 then effectively if you have low sugar and 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.130
 little white flour is yes that's the way it is 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.250
 the two main causes in principle 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:03.450
 should not occur in all diets 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:06.030
 whether as a running shoe low carb or 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.619
 palais or whatever does yes and 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.300
 so I just liked that 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.950
 you do not just have that name necessarily 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.349
 always used 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.150
 because that's the main reason 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.310
 because you eat healthy food 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.129
 naturally nourished and processed 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.620
 products and so on and I used 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:23.450
 would wish me as German 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.920
 that we go in that direction 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.019
 So let's not say we are doing low carb 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.950
 or we make low fat and we do 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:33.620
 shit so processed that would be 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.459
 once a national recommendation was ok 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.950
 I just say I found it 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.680
 pretty interesting, I'm curious what 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.440
 it still happens how the whole thing continues 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.870
 developed and if mine is mine too 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.370
 a good test audience so to speak if 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.530
 We now all notice that Sweden in 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.849
 a few decades the healthiest 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.410
 People of the world are then we know 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.060
 modest and if it float in a 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.019
 few decades then no longer exist 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.480
 we must also inform 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.620
 okay we are at the next video now 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.950
 It's off to training 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.950
 ciao
