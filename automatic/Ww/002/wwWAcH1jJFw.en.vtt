00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.440
 the guy ran into you and well 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.820
 see how great it is we find ourselves 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.130
 for new players on fifa 15 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.090
 episodes 6 already episode 6 we're going 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.469
 introduce four new players 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.490
 today at the program so just 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.560
 before I start I want to clarify 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.210
 that I will never introduce players 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.220
 such as mastour how much to the chagrin 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.230
 martial and his stockings because they are 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.310
 bronze players or silver days and 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.990
 it's players that I can not 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.820
 do indeed I create titles 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.650
 to 15 as you see it even to a lot 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.420
 on the screen and I can create that two 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.920
 karts horde to create money cards 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.910
 or bronze that is why I can by 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.770
 a hollow of players like base round 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.570
 how van dyke these pirates are 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.489
 11 people and money 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.230
 if you can create one, do not hesitate 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.710
 not to pass them to me for swiss ink and 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.270
 me too 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.230
 and that it returns I can not so 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.640
 that's why it will not appear 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.110
 never in new players from 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.430
 gilles to 15 in any case today we 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.989
 is still going four super super players 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.660
 interesting we have the first player 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.340
 konoplyanka the Ukrainian player of 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.820
 liverpool and who just signed to 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.559
 liverpool 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.239
 he will make his appearance in viva car 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.800
 he had never been in fifa I would have 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.539
 been on an old never really very 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.460
 very very old I remember him 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.830
 I believe on fifa 10 where he was hopes 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.290
 in a club I do not know which one so 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.490
 konopka who reviews his appearance in 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.900
 not live it's true it's a 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.700
 player we 've ever seen a day that 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.500
 nobody knows and I believe that 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.240
 next year it'll be a nugget 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.979
 guys a nugget like you do not have 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.240
 never seen there is in liverpool which 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.460
 who will be boarding the first lines 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.810
 and sincerely it's going to be exceptional 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.710
 to inform them because I'm hiding from you 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.750
 not that it's a player I know 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.860
 not finally if I know him when we play 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.060
 france ukraine where when I see the 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.040
 dynamo from Kiev played once every 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.090
 ten years you see but sincerely that 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.619
 two case complaints I saw he had 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.659
 a very big rating that it's a player 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.890
 who did very good stats that all 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.360
 the world went to him very good stats 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.020
 So that's what I made myself a 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.689
 90 in speed 1.86 feel 1 75 years old pulls 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.640
 a 70-year old goes after the stats in the lead 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.110
 and in anecdotal defense but 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.460
 Sincerely there are four stars 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.780
 technical gesture and 4 bad stars 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.710
 foot I hesitated to put him three 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.180
 bad foot star because I'm 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.799
 am saying damn there are too good 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.270
 stats but I think kono punk 1 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.710
 next year is going to be super great 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.659
 good fats really a type of player 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.100
 super interesting in any case know that 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.469
 I will be one of the first to test it 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.149
 because that's good I'm sial I think the 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.799
 first to introduce you to konopka 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.340
 not a lot who say they're good if I 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.869
 test that our case plans 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.729
 I sincerely assure you that this player 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.680
 it will be tested at the beginning you go there 15 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.840
 is good fast thriller my shot a good 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.220
 smuggler he's going to be very very very good a 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.080
 very very good player off game you there 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.810
 on the second player it's younes 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.400
 benayoun i spent yum for all 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.110
 break benayoun ever called by his 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.819
 first name anyway to benayoun it's a 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.980
 player we had not seen on giffa 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.030
 14 who was on giffa 13 that you see 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.430
 his card a very very card 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.720
 interesting a map really of mc I 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.650
 would not put it out because it's true 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.549
 to work I like to see 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.410
 techniques etc 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:37.510
 but on his map he's not very it's a 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.790
 very good m o it is in any case very good 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.650
 mc he had honorable stats 110 m 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.480
 hedges everywhere even 82 in dribble rather 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.349
 not bad it's true that there he signed to 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.420
 qpr 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.610
 as you see it right so this 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.780
 times it will be mc and sincerely it's the 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.569
 stadium are still quite down 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.870
 younes benayoun not worth it anyway 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.910
 badly lowered 69 2 speeds 76 in dribbling 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.040
 he loses a lot in dribbling 70 feel 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.930
 76 years passes where he keeps his stats in 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.700
 page I think what is normal but seen 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.019
 the players when they get older khifa 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.519
 used to larros and their stats in 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.049
 pass but lower the speed it is 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.340
 which was done - 2nd in speed 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.709
 so it's true that he's a player who 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.030
 is going to be in barclay it's a player who 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.900
 do not tempt me at all because it's true 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.730
 we notice there are players 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.920
 exceptional in the middle of middle 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.840
 center and I think benayoun will only be 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.489
 than a second knife and again can be 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.109
 a third knife because that's 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.549
 true that it really starts to be 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:26.769
 less and less interesting lyonnais 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.359
 this bn belays uci this fatras I was light 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.470
 and there he will really be very very 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:30.940
 light it's really something I do not 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.620
 do not advise you it can be 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.819
 interesting for hybrids etc 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.260
 because they play qpr and the 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.000
 Israeli 5 1 does not have thirty five thousand 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.130
 the Israelis but sincerely holy 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.989
 jeans that I do not advise who will 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.220
 cost certainly cheap but I think 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.540
 that there will be a lot better in 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.950
 barclay especially when barclays ya 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.079
 so many joe papp players or can 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.430
 you repatriate on a beautiful ayoun 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:50.079
 when I kill you head the third night 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.690
 the penultimate player of this episode 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:54.760
 this is alves alves the defender 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.099
 central zenith saint Petersburg which 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.329
 were not present unless he went 13 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:59.470
 I do not really know why it's true 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.609
 that I'm not too much this player but in 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.319
 anyway he was at the world cup 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:03.669
 etc and we did not see on fifa 13 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.609
 he had a map yet on six 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:08.049
 points 14 a map where there is no 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:09.250
 photo on flute help but he had when 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:12.220
 even stages of me I put his card 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.169
 on fifa 13 so alves to a player who has 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.819
 played the world cup and it's a 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:17.470
 player who I think will go down so I 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.890
 will leave the same general 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.750
 based on his old fifa 13 stats on 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.850
 his stats know us and thanks to 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.470
 a fifa head 14 and his stages of 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.090
 foot world cup and finally it's ok 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.610
 give a player who keep pretty much 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.190
 the same stats you will pretty much keep 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.050
 all the same it will rise to the top in 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.360
 defense because he gets older but a little 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.380
 I think to go down bruno 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.790
 alves I think it will be a defender 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.150
 interesting for a Portuguese 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.380
 especially 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.820
 it is true that we are used to 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.380
 grandpa but who we go next and there the 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.080
 question to arise and I think that alves 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.220
 will be well well the weight indeed the 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.200
 very very big reign thailand is 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.120
 good so much defense it will be a little slow 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.860
 but hey if you put a tp by 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.030
 example will be largely compensated it's a 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.380
 zenit player saint Petersburg so 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.770
 it's not sure they're good titles 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.200
 at 15 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:02.050
 in any case we hope it has lifted it will be 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.760
 an interesting defender especially in d1 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.590
 Russian in Russian d1 it's true that for 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.760
 cheap alves maybe not bad in 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.410
 the more he is not either you are god in 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.430
 speed he's 66 is not like he had 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.890
 63 etc. 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.480
 no he has 66 is not bad and has stats 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.260
 rather homogeneous in the rest of the esat 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.669
 around 60 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.290
 it's not disgusting it's a player 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:19.300
 which will really be a wall in 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.500
 defense and we go on with the last 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.160
 player and willy pointed out that I 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.510
 go much faster 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.550
 just because I 'm trying but no 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.690
 more concise episodes we go on 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.669
 with the last toy to the last 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.930
 player it's asamoah gyan asamoah gyan 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:30.550
 so a player we had not seen since 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.100
 for a very long time this film is returned and 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:37.510
 we saw it again on it is returned the sentence 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:38.010
 of world-wide sexual rahzel fagot 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.729
 clean 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.229
 asamoah gyan it's true we did not have 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:43.590
 not seen since many fifa we have 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:46.570
 found this time it's better on fifa 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:48.010
 football cup and it's true that asamoah 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.260
 gyan saint geours who had 82 general 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.930
 on foot walker 81 on these versions 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.340
 sunderland of fifa 13 me I think that 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.940
 saab region is a joint and already that 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.440
 sign in Qatar 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.000
 our preparation level it will be a little 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.010
 not so good it cut of the world when 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.390
 even though they showed that they 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.530
 were not finished clearly asamoah 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.370
 gyan he showed he wanted it that 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.200
 it's a genre that was fighting on the 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.669
 This is why stats stats stats 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.640
 have hardly moved I just have him 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:10.780
 to remove 1 - 1 in shots I put 79.2 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.430
 general since here he plays anyway 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.290
 in Qatar it is less and less important 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.460
 exposed so general function decline I 

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.960
 also want a little settled in the lead I 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.700
 think his card will be very very 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.630
 interesting for a Ghana team that's 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.550
 true that it is always a pleasure 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.390
 to have a really interesting scorer 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.830
 as asanoah gyan 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:25.090
 I really hope that we will have flat sion 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.770
 of Qatar because it really begins to be 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.560
 interesting players like 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.900
 especially 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.370
 man to that I am sincerely 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.389
 really makes you want to test it he has 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.740
 three-star technical gesture three 

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:35.210
 stars bad foot it's not a day 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.200
 great what it is but we know that this 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.610
 day there is a player who fights for 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.169
 those who saw the World Cup and the 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.520
 ghana world cup you know that 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:42.860

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.000
 will give everything to the end and holy 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.160
 servan saint geours tested ya 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.260
 really nice hybrids to do 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.490
 especially with andré ayew equiterra 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.510
 all to ghana players who can 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.040
 really be super cool 

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.600
 the ghana team really becomes is 

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.950
 nascent and I hope precisely for the 

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.750
 well of this ghana team they 

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:58.280
 will put the qatar league to have 

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.960
 asamoah gyan who looks to me just very 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.300
 very beautiful who looks good fast 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.169
 very good dribbler hits that I am 

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.030
 sure and certain that he will have a good 

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:06.530
 strike not passable in the lead 

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:08.120
 sincerely it is a player that I you 

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:09.500
 advise for the next fifa so 

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.030

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.470
 sixth episode of the new players 

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.550

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.169
