00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.039
 recommend 30 minutes before or 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.200
 one hour of exercising you consume 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.909
 some kind of fruit like apple or 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.920

 is that you feel light and with many 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.869

 kind of complex carbohydrate a good 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.660
 option can be a quesadilla always

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.230
 protein or some energy bar 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.090
 but you also have to have a lot 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.760
 Beware of labels since many 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.010
 bars that have an average of 90 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.410
