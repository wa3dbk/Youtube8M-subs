00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.970
 before going into the issue of eviction 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:09.970
 and of the business that has mounted panfilo the 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:13.400
 Havana thing I support many houses 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:15.170
 I would miss that in Cuba for good in these 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.270
 moments according to statistics for 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.490
 cover the basics a million houses 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:25.230
 build one million homes is the 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:28.230
 deficit of English that exist more 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.380
 Possible decisions are in poor condition 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.360
 then that 60% is not shabby 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.070
 enter the real estate market not 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.629
 they go to buy the mind or advertise 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.970
 they announce it repeated in their time 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:41.560
 because nobody is going to buy it 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.910
 I had nobody buy the solar 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.910
 of reverberatory called 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:50.610
 in Havana roads in places 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.920
 strategic you can become 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.010
 a business because the old Havana has 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.440
 that historical center and attracts many 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:03.180
 tourists etcetera beach that has 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.850
 good constructions there are many in 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.710
 the road direction of Cuba there is no 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.740
 there is only one project for construction 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.750
 of dwellings there are no however there are 22 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.479
 large projects for production of 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.280
 each 400 million cement all 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.630
 for national consumption the 20 says in 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.160
 them 20 percent for consumption 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.250
 national and 80 to export I do not know to 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.250
 where but a million houses 

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:32.460
 meanwhile comes the theme of 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.080
 eviction let's see some pictures of 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.080
 the eviction in Cuba 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:45.570
 We cheat each other damage 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.570
 let's do things 

00:01:55.859 --> 00:02:00.789
 garcía millán there do not collapse on as 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:03.729
 if we were dogs they did not give us their age 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:05.289
 or not in last third any faith nothing of 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.149
 that matters, nothing matters, looking for 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.270
 we cubans for street do not do 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:12.750
 nothing 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:16.650
 today they were reminding me that fidel 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:19.040
 Castro from the speech is the memorioso 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.040
 of 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.610
 of self-defense after the assault on 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:28.690
 barracks moncada as the story I 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:31.000
 will absolve already spoke of the evictions 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.850
 as of a great evil and especially during 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.440
 the first ten fifteen years of being 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.600
 in power they bothered with that the 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.510
 previous system evicted for that reason that 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.000
 the people still in his memory are 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.190
 it bothers a lot when when when you see 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.370
 this regime evicting the poor not 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:51.430
 is that that revolution was made between 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.330
 other things supposedly to finish 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.840
 with the development and see if that was 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.790
 something injected into the collective psyche 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.220
 constantly through propaganda 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.800
 of regime between novel as 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.620
 We were talking about walking king right now 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.800
 town with me a lot there was no news to 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.080
 I am the face I wore gave me the 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.850
 eight of the night that during the 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.200
 first years do not deal with the subject of 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.930
 agrarian 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.940
 the development issue so that what 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.970
 they were and obviously clear that there was 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.260
 eviction and I imagine it was like 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.650
 happens anywhere people who 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.269
 hand did not pay the people who were 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.099
 he had made his house in the place 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.620
 probably wrong and some 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:38.459
 injustices too but I think that 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.530
 this regime since 1959 has established the 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.379
 development not only of the houses but of 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.659
 the estate of the property of everything that 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:48.269
 you could but you can see that you say 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:52.260
 eviction and one thinks about it immediately 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:54.269
 the peasant eviction but nowadays 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.640
 there is an eviction uruguay tremendous unemployment 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.579
 especially the orientals in Havana and 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.859
 recently this scandal that arose there 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:04.560
 I think that near the central park I 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:07.109
 gives the company of a family that has been 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.900
 evicted and he is there as in 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:13.579
 galliano in galliano we will not see 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.579
 remember that tremendous image 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.639
 we are talking about children are 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.289
 dressed as pioneers he says that 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:32.560
 nine months ago they do not go to the 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:34.330
 school because they are not allowed 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.060
 admit in those schools because they do not 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.530
 they are not there and the people I think with 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.650
 a lot of justice always says where they are from 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:44.439
 raul is fidel are also Palestinians 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.919
 they are also a good Palestinian we are going to 

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:46.919
 see now 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.510
 it's funny because there's a bit of 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:56.009
 of tragedy what of panfilo not every time 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:58.830
 that someone is visiting here from 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:01.889
 miami and he meets pánfilo puts him 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.599
 the camera and makes him mount his show that 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:05.069
 it might seem like a mockery 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:06.229
 of panfilo but at the end it has turned 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:09.119
 a good business 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:11.849
 something starts if it is not a bottle is a 

00:05:09.119 --> 00:05:15.689
 food and he knows that he has become 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:18.389
 a colorful character then explodes 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:22.369
 that characteristic that has to attract 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:22.369
 the people and tell the truth 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.110
 he's done a business telling the truth 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.920
 the fault is all the others who 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:36.610
 lie let's see Panfilo in his show 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:39.840
 number 3000 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.840
 when they thought about that 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.220
 rag doll 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.120
 Hello 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.680
 Hungry 3000 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.680
 and me 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.940
 do not 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:35.890
 It is a show that has other notice 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:38.050
 and now you fanfare in a row not 

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:40.150
 is more known here of course that in 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:42.400
 Cuba, many people who come from Cuba 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.950
 knows who panfilo imagine that now 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.320
 it happens to him like so many others who are very 

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:52.580
 known outside but inside but inside 

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:56.389
 they are not known I think the 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:58.370
 the exchange this agreement I am a 

00:06:56.389 --> 00:07:00.969
 economic liberal I think if that 

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:03.110
 he sells and he can live on that's fine 

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:06.310
 is saying here I'm living from 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.310
 story and each place 

00:07:07.479 --> 00:07:14.030
 this is always how you have lived 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:15.139
 When this is not the product of 

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.789
 communists and there has always been of 

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:19.900
 accounts I think it's okay if this 

00:07:16.789 --> 00:07:22.250
 man can earn his livelihood and his 

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:23.719
 Red path through doing 

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.949
 perfect beads 

00:07:23.719 --> 00:07:28.150
 the other stories are the ones that I do not 

00:07:24.949 --> 00:07:28.150
 I want and more I prefer to go to 

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.510
 today I tell you this that they are 

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:33.070
 doing every day 

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:35.430
 now comes the reform and now we are going to 

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.430
 change 

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.610
 because for me the most sincere is a country 

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:41.800
 where everyone is crazy crazy about 

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:44.500
 truth is they tell you the truth if 

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:47.890
 the crazy ones are more sane 

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:50.440
 that happens but let's go to a brief pause 

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:52.710
 we come back here in this madness of 

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.710
 mirror
