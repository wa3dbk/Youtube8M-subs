changes

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.010 

in<00:01:14.270> this<00:01:14.420> section<00:01:14.719> here<00:01:15.200> i<00:01:15.259> used<00:01:15.680> to<00:01:15.799> have<00:01:15.920> some

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
in this section here i used to have some

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.590 
in this section here i used to have some
amplifiers<00:01:18.020> and

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.920 

equally<00:01:22.170> as<00:01:22.290> some<00:01:22.439> amplifiers<00:01:22.830> ever<00:01:23.010> used<00:01:23.220> for

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
equally as some amplifiers ever used for

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.460 
equally as some amplifiers ever used for
bass<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.229> treble<00:01:25.409> equalization<00:01:26.450> I

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
bass and treble equalization I

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.170 
bass and treble equalization I
subsequently<00:01:28.470> found<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:29.130> they<00:01:29.520> just<00:01:29.940> did

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
subsequently found that they just did

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.200 
subsequently found that they just did
not<00:01:30.450> provide<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.470> quality<00:01:31.830> of<00:01:32.159> audio<00:01:32.460> that

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
not provide the quality of audio that

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.560 
not provide the quality of audio that
was<00:01:33.450> desired<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.890> those<00:01:35.220> were<00:01:35.369> removed<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.090> I

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
was desired so those were removed and I

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.660 
was desired so those were removed and I
have<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.350> separate<00:01:38.479> actual<00:01:39.479> audio<00:01:40.350> mixer<00:01:40.830> of<00:01:41.549> a

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
have a separate actual audio mixer of a

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.980 
have a separate actual audio mixer of a
higher<00:01:41.909> grade<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:43.289> I<00:01:43.560> replaced<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.670> with

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
higher grade of you I replaced that with

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.760 
higher grade of you I replaced that with
an<00:01:45.990> LCD<00:01:46.470> display<00:01:47.039> its<00:01:47.280> touch<00:01:47.580> screen<00:01:48.500> and<00:01:49.500> its

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
bits fed by the Arduino so I know it's

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.660 
bits fed by the Arduino so I know it's
hard<00:01:53.039> to<00:01:53.250> see<00:01:53.490> but<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:55.080> new<00:01:55.229> LCD<00:01:55.619> display<00:01:56.280> I

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
hard to see but the new LCD display I

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.460 
hard to see but the new LCD display I
had<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.390> put<00:01:57.569> in<00:01:57.720> there<00:01:57.899> because<00:01:58.259> they<00:01:58.409> were

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
had to put in there because they were

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.110 
had to put in there because they were
just<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:59.009> much<00:01:59.220> Disick<00:02:00.210> Diane

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120

so<00:02:57.150> software<00:02:57.629> calculates<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.799> distance

00:02:59.179 --> 00:02:59.189 
so software calculates the distance

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:01.550 
so software calculates the distance
we've<00:02:59.340> traveled<00:03:00.000> as<00:03:00.209> we<00:03:00.719> pick<00:03:01.019> up<00:03:01.170> things<00:03:01.349> like

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
we've traveled as we pick up things like

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.520 
we've traveled as we pick up things like
couple<00:03:02.129> or<00:03:02.280> slack<00:03:02.750> so<00:03:03.750> I<00:03:03.780> know<00:03:03.870> this<00:03:04.079> is<00:03:04.260> kind

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
couple or slack so I know this is kind

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.520 
couple or slack so I know this is kind
of<00:03:04.560> boring<00:03:04.829> I'm<00:03:05.189> focusing<00:03:05.969> on<00:03:06.510> this<00:03:07.049> motor

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
of boring I'm focusing on this motor

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.830 
of boring I'm focusing on this motor
here<00:03:08.010> but<00:03:08.579> the<00:03:08.700> key<00:03:08.909> point<00:03:09.209> of<00:03:09.390> this<00:03:09.540> motor

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
here but the key point of this motor

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.440 
here but the key point of this motor
while<00:03:10.469> we're<00:03:10.650> doing<00:03:10.829> this<00:03:11.159> this<00:03:11.489> run<00:03:11.819> here<00:03:12.269> is

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
while we're doing this this run here is

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.319 
while we're doing this this run here is
this<00:03:13.140> motor<00:03:14.000> essentially<00:03:15.000> gives<00:03:15.239> a

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
this motor essentially gives a

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:16.970 
this motor essentially gives a
representation<00:03:15.689> of<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.290> locomotive<00:03:16.950> that

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
representation of the locomotive that

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.949 
representation of the locomotive that
would<00:03:17.280> be<00:03:17.400> on<00:03:17.609> a<00:03:17.970> train<00:03:18.390> layout<00:03:19.489> and<00:03:20.489> so<00:03:20.959> this

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
would be on a train layout and so this

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.920 
would be on a train layout and so this
is<00:03:22.170> where<00:03:22.319> it<00:03:22.439> gets<00:03:22.530> a<00:03:22.680> little<00:03:22.799> confusing<00:03:23.040> is

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
is where it gets a little confusing is

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.289 
is where it gets a little confusing is
it's<00:03:24.930> only<00:03:25.170> going<00:03:25.379> to<00:03:25.439> rotate<00:03:25.620> when<00:03:26.549> the

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
it's only going to rotate when the

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.129 
it's only going to rotate when the
simulation<00:03:28.109> needs<00:03:28.439> to<00:03:28.920> make<00:03:29.189> the<00:03:30.139> locomotive

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
simulation needs to make the locomotive

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.740 
simulation needs to make the locomotive
move<00:03:31.650> that<00:03:32.159> doesn't<00:03:32.670> necessarily<00:03:32.819> mean<00:03:33.389> the

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
move that doesn't necessarily mean the

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.610 
move that doesn't necessarily mean the
wheels<00:03:34.170> would<00:03:34.530> be<00:03:34.680> turning<00:03:35.689> an<00:03:36.689> example<00:03:37.319> would

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
wheels would be turning an example would

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.179 
wheels would be turning an example would
be<00:03:37.680> if<00:03:38.250> I<00:03:38.819> click<00:03:39.269> the<00:03:39.450> locomotive<00:03:40.049> on<00:03:40.260> AIDS<00:03:40.680> on

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:41.189 
be if I click the locomotive on AIDS on

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:44.960 
be if I click the locomotive on AIDS on
a<00:03:41.250> grade<00:03:41.879> and<00:03:42.359> I<00:03:42.720> put<00:03:42.900> enough<00:03:43.889> boxcars<00:03:44.639> on

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
a grade and I put enough boxcars on

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.770 
a grade and I put enough boxcars on
this<00:03:45.209> thing

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
this thing

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.350 
this thing
the<00:03:47.319> engines<00:03:47.709> are<00:03:48.010> sliding<00:03:48.670> backwards<00:03:49.180> and

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
the engines are sliding backwards and

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.940 
the engines are sliding backwards and
I'll<00:03:49.420> do<00:03:49.569> this<00:03:49.750> at<00:03:49.959> the<00:03:50.080> end<00:03:50.110> when<00:03:50.500> I<00:03:50.530> shut<00:03:50.800> the

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
I'll do this at the end when I shut the

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.880 
I'll do this at the end when I shut the
engine<00:03:51.310> off<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:53.290> wheels<00:03:53.500> aren't<00:03:53.770> turning

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
engine off the wheels aren't turning

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.570 
engine off the wheels aren't turning
it's<00:03:54.610> just<00:03:54.970> I<00:03:55.180> put<00:03:55.690> so<00:03:55.900> many<00:03:55.959> boxcars<00:03:56.860> on<00:03:57.280> it's

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
it's just I put so many boxcars on it's

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.300 
it's just I put so many boxcars on it's
just<00:03:57.819> simply<00:03:58.150> dragging<00:03:58.720> it<00:03:59.110> down<00:03:59.140> the<00:03:59.920> slope

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
just simply dragging it down the slope

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.180 
just simply dragging it down the slope
so<00:04:01.240> the<00:04:01.780> motor<00:04:02.050> is<00:04:02.200> going<00:04:02.319> to<00:04:02.380> turn<00:04:02.740> because

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
so the motor is going to turn because

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.010 
so the motor is going to turn because
the<00:04:03.430> simulation<00:04:04.000> is<00:04:04.209> going<00:04:04.420> to<00:04:04.510> want<00:04:04.720> to<00:04:04.780> give

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 
the simulation is going to want to give

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.470 
the simulation is going to want to give
you<00:04:05.950> know<00:04:06.130> you<00:04:06.730> know<00:04:06.850> on<00:04:07.000> what<00:04:07.209> is<00:04:07.270> on<00:04:07.390> the

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
you know you know on what is on the

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.050 
you know you know on what is on the
train<00:04:07.720> layout<00:04:08.140> to<00:04:08.350> actually<00:04:08.590> force<00:04:09.550> it<00:04:09.760> to<00:04:09.910> be

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
train layout to actually force it to be

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.050 
train layout to actually force it to be
dried<00:04:10.510> univ<00:04:10.870> going<00:04:11.200> backwards<00:04:11.950> but<00:04:12.730> it's<00:04:12.880> not

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
dried univ going backwards but it's not

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.030 
dried univ going backwards but it's not
really<00:04:13.239> going<00:04:13.600> under<00:04:13.900> power<00:04:14.170> it's<00:04:14.650> just

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
really going under power it's just

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.860 
really going under power it's just
creating<00:04:15.400> the<00:04:15.780> delusion<00:04:16.780> so<00:04:17.320> it

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
creating the delusion so it

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.750 
creating the delusion so it
it's<00:04:18.260> one<00:04:18.440> of<00:04:18.500> the<00:04:18.590> areas<00:04:18.889> that<00:04:18.919> make<00:04:19.310> some<00:04:19.639> of

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
it's one of the areas that make some of

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.330 
it's one of the areas that make some of
this<00:04:19.880> little<00:04:20.870> bit<00:04:21.019> confusing<00:04:21.530> you<00:04:22.130> know<00:04:22.160> when

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
this little bit confusing you know when

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.400 
this little bit confusing you know when
we're<00:04:22.490> operating<00:04:22.990> so<00:04:23.990> I'm<00:04:24.050> going<00:04:24.229> to<00:04:24.260> get

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
we're operating so I'm going to get

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.950 
we're operating so I'm going to get
ready<00:04:24.530> to<00:04:24.620> go<00:04:24.710> forward<00:04:25.449> and<00:04:26.449> I<00:04:26.570> have<00:04:26.720> a<00:04:26.750> bunch

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
ready to go forward and I have a bunch

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.110 
ready to go forward and I have a bunch
of<00:04:27.080> boxcars<00:04:27.740> on<00:04:28.010> on<00:04:28.370> it<00:04:28.639> and<00:04:30.310> any<00:04:31.310> time<00:04:31.550> that<00:04:31.580> we

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
of boxcars on on it and any time that we

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.540 
of boxcars on on it and any time that we
go<00:04:32.270> forward<00:04:32.570> or<00:04:32.870> backwards<00:04:33.500> in<00:04:33.889> this

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
go forward or backwards in this

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.999 
go forward or backwards in this
stop<00:04:35.000> by<00:04:35.180> the<00:04:35.240> throttle

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:37.009 
stop by the throttle

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:39.899 
stop by the throttle
we're<00:04:37.580> going<00:04:37.729> to<00:04:37.789> pick<00:04:37.939> up<00:04:38.089> the<00:04:38.419> slack<00:04:38.710> and

00:04:39.899 --> 00:04:39.909 
we're going to pick up the slack and

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:42.609 
we're going to pick up the slack and
when<00:04:40.909> go<00:04:41.119> forward<00:04:41.479> pay<00:04:41.719> attention<00:04:41.749> to<00:04:42.379> the<00:04:42.469> way

00:04:42.609 --> 00:04:42.619 
when go forward pay attention to the way

00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:46.359 
when go forward pay attention to the way
the<00:04:42.979> sound<00:04:43.339> also<00:04:43.999> changes<00:04:44.839> as<00:04:45.050> we<00:04:45.800> go<00:04:46.009> farther

00:04:46.359 --> 00:04:46.369 
the sound also changes as we go farther

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:48.549 
the sound also changes as we go farther
and<00:04:46.610> farther<00:04:46.879> the<00:04:47.449> sound<00:04:47.689> changes<00:04:47.930> and<00:04:48.379> goes

00:04:48.549 --> 00:04:48.559 
and farther the sound changes and goes

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:50.859 
and farther the sound changes and goes
gives<00:04:49.460> the<00:04:49.580> illusion<00:04:49.639> of<00:04:50.029> the<00:04:50.419> sound<00:04:50.659> is

00:04:50.859 --> 00:04:50.869 
gives the illusion of the sound is

00:04:50.869 --> 00:04:53.469 
gives the illusion of the sound is
farther<00:04:51.319> and<00:04:51.499> farther<00:04:51.800> on<00:04:52.219> in<00:04:52.879> the<00:04:52.999> distance

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:53.479 
farther and farther on in the distance

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:56.889 
farther and farther on in the distance
and<00:04:53.949> the<00:04:54.949> actual<00:04:55.309> feel<00:04:55.789> of<00:04:56.149> the<00:04:56.389> of<00:04:56.719> the

and the actual feel of the of the
coupler<00:04:57.139> slot<00:04:57.710> is<00:04:58.099> felt<00:04:58.879> in<00:04:59.119> the<00:04:59.589> caps<00:05:00.589> see

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:01.069 
coupler slot is felt in the caps see

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:04.239 
coupler slot is felt in the caps see
where<00:05:01.969> you<00:05:02.180> can't<00:05:02.419> hear<00:05:02.869> it<00:05:02.899> but<00:05:03.229> you<00:05:03.860> can<00:05:04.039> feel

00:05:04.239 --> 00:05:04.249 
where you can't hear it but you can feel

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:43.090 
where you can't hear it but you can feel
it

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:43.100 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.940 

you<00:05:43.700> can<00:05:43.880> notice<00:05:44.060> that<00:05:44.420> even<00:05:44.720> so<00:05:45.110> I've<00:05:45.650> gone

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:45.950 
you can notice that even so I've gone

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:49.629 
you can notice that even so I've gone
back<00:05:46.190> to<00:05:46.400> idle<00:05:46.880> I've<00:05:47.450> got<00:05:47.690> a<00:05:47.720> lot<00:05:48.080> of<00:05:48.110> masculine

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:49.639 
back to idle I've got a lot of masculine

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:51.909 
back to idle I've got a lot of masculine
and<00:05:49.759> this<00:05:49.969> thing<00:05:50.210> to<00:05:50.539> keep<00:05:50.719> on<00:05:50.960> rolling<00:05:51.620> for<00:05:51.889> a

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 
and this thing to keep on rolling for a

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:53.559 
and this thing to keep on rolling for a
while

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:53.569 
while

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:55.959 
while
so<00:05:54.110> in<00:05:54.229> this<00:05:54.349> situation<00:05:54.559> I<00:05:55.309> had<00:05:55.610> the<00:05:55.699> brakes

00:05:55.959 --> 00:05:55.969 
so in this situation I had the brakes

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:58.570 
so in this situation I had the brakes
off<00:05:56.469> but<00:05:57.469> I'm<00:05:57.589> going<00:05:57.860> to<00:05:58.009> essentially<00:05:58.429> be

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 
off but I'm going to essentially be

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:03.290 
off but I'm going to essentially be
tilting<00:05:59.419> the<00:05:59.779> grade<00:06:00.080> of<00:06:00.110> the<00:06:00.439> track

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.890 

essentially<00:06:04.169> i'm<00:06:04.289> doing

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.770 

we're<00:06:07.080> just<00:06:07.199> rolling

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:08.780 
we're just rolling

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.430 
we're just rolling
so<00:06:08.960> the<00:06:09.080> mass<00:06:09.320> not<00:06:09.860> the<00:06:10.010> engine<00:06:10.190> there

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:12.440 
so the mass not the engine there

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.780 
so the mass not the engine there
essentially<00:06:13.440> if<00:06:13.530> we<00:06:13.620> get<00:06:13.800> enough<00:06:14.160> it's<00:06:14.490> just

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:14.790 
essentially if we get enough it's just

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:16.170 
essentially if we get enough it's just
going<00:06:15.060> to<00:06:15.150> perpetual

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:16.180 
going to perpetual

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.530 
going to perpetual
speed<00:06:16.990> up<00:06:17.259> and

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:18.540 
speed up and

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.170 
speed up and
he<00:06:18.660> finds<00:06:19.260> his<00:06:19.350> equilibrium

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 
he finds his equilibrium

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.620 
he finds his equilibrium
you'll<00:06:21.720> run<00:06:21.960> away<00:06:22.050> trained<00:06:22.470> with

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:23.630 
you'll run away trained with

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.180 
you'll run away trained with
don't<00:06:23.870> stop

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.190 
don't stop

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.670 
don't stop
so<00:06:25.640> now<00:06:25.970> in<00:06:26.150> this<00:06:26.300> situation<00:06:26.380> I've<00:06:27.380> got<00:06:27.560> the

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680 
so now in this situation I've got the

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.300 
so now in this situation I've got the
breaks

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.310 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.160 

and<00:06:30.580> I'm<00:06:30.760> going<00:06:30.970> to<00:06:31.000> tilt<00:06:31.300> the<00:06:31.360> track<00:06:31.780> and<00:06:32.080> this

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:32.170 
and I'm going to tilt the track and this

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.290 
and I'm going to tilt the track and this
is<00:06:32.380> the<00:06:32.650> part<00:06:32.890> my<00:06:33.070> wife<00:06:33.370> hates<00:06:33.610> because<00:06:34.120> this

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:34.300 
is the part my wife hates because this

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.950 
is the part my wife hates because this
noise<00:06:34.720> just<00:06:34.870> reaches<00:06:35.590> to<00:06:35.710> the<00:06:35.740> house<00:06:36.600> so<00:06:37.600> when

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:37.960 
noise just reaches to the house so when

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.980 
noise just reaches to the house so when
we<00:06:38.110> tilt<00:06:38.350> the<00:06:38.530> track<00:06:38.800> enough

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:39.990 
we tilt the track enough

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.080 
we tilt the track enough
we<00:06:40.380> have<00:06:40.470> seven<00:06:40.890> is<00:06:41.220> just<00:06:41.460> like<00:06:41.580> a<00:06:41.610> bill<00:06:41.880> to

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:42.090 
we have seven is just like a bill to

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:46.600 
we have seven is just like a bill to
hold<00:06:42.630> that<00:06:42.780> weight

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:46.610 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.409 

and<00:06:46.909> once<00:06:47.659> it<00:06:47.840> slides<00:06:48.669> the<00:06:49.669> acceleration

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:50.419 
and once it slides the acceleration

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:52.420 
and once it slides the acceleration
equal<00:06:50.780> league<00:06:50.930> built<00:06:51.319> up<00:06:51.620> because<00:06:52.009> blocker

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:52.430 
equal league built up because blocker

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:57.100 
equal league built up because blocker
traction<00:06:53.210> effort

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.110 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:07.710 

I'll<00:06:58.110> be<00:06:58.410> an<00:06:58.530> integer

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:07.720 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.450 

so<00:07:08.720> right<00:07:09.590> now<00:07:09.620> what<00:07:09.920> I'm<00:07:10.040> going<00:07:10.160> to<00:07:10.220> be<00:07:10.280> doing

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:10.460 
so right now what I'm going to be doing

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.830 
so right now what I'm going to be doing
is<00:07:10.640> I'm<00:07:10.730> going<00:07:10.880> to<00:07:10.940> give<00:07:11.120> this<00:07:11.150> a<00:07:11.330> really<00:07:11.600> heavy

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840 
is I'm going to give this a really heavy

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:21.070 
is I'm going to give this a really heavy
great<00:07:17.320> so<00:07:18.320> that's<00:07:18.410> my<00:07:18.770> update<00:07:19.040> for<00:07:20.080> this

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:21.080 
great so that's my update for this

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.840 
great so that's my update for this
couple<00:07:21.320> of<00:07:21.530> weeks<00:07:21.770> hopefully<00:07:22.160> the<00:07:22.460> next<00:07:22.580> time

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:22.850 
couple of weeks hopefully the next time

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:25.000 
couple of weeks hopefully the next time
we<00:07:23.180> go<00:07:23.570> and<00:07:23.900> override<00:07:24.320> and<00:07:24.470> we'll<00:07:24.680> be<00:07:24.800> starting

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.010 
we go and override and we'll be starting

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:28.450 
we go and override and we'll be starting
to<00:07:25.250> get<00:07:25.370> into<00:07:25.760> some<00:07:26.630> more<00:07:27.290> of<00:07:27.650> the<00:07:27.740> cosmetics

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:28.460 
to get into some more of the cosmetics

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.940 
to get into some more of the cosmetics
and<00:07:28.790> start<00:07:29.570> talking<00:07:29.690> about<00:07:29.930> how<00:07:30.590> to<00:07:30.680> make<00:07:30.830> the

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:30.950 
and start talking about how to make the

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.940 
and start talking about how to make the
windshield<00:07:31.610> and<00:07:32.180> the<00:07:32.990> camera<00:07:33.500> that<00:07:33.710> will<00:07:33.800> be

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:33.950 
windshield and the camera that will be

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:35.629 
windshield and the camera that will be
in<00:07:34.100> the<00:07:34.310> local

00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:35.639 
in the local

00:07:35.639 --> 00:07:38.999 
in the local
looking<00:07:36.639> at<00:07:36.790> the<00:07:36.910> screen

00:07:38.999 --> 00:07:39.009 
looking at the screen

00:07:39.009 --> 00:07:41.609 
looking at the screen
we<00:07:39.460> still<00:07:39.669> have<00:07:39.819> enough<00:07:40.629> pressure<00:07:40.990> still<00:07:41.559> in

00:07:41.609 --> 00:07:41.619 
we still have enough pressure still in

00:07:41.619 --> 00:07:46.010 
we still have enough pressure still in
this<00:07:41.979> thing<00:07:42.279> too

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:46.020 

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:51.270 

gumball<00:07:47.020> horn<00:07:47.760> I'll<00:07:48.760> talk<00:07:48.970> to<00:07:49.030> you<00:07:49.210> later
