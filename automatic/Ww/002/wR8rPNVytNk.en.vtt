00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.850 
demonstrate to you guys how I do it how
I<00:00:31.679> apply<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.340> whisker<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:34.020> works<00:00:34.290> amazing

I apply the whisker and it works amazing

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.130 
I apply the whisker and it works amazing
because<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.489> don't<00:00:36.030> have<00:00:36.180> long<00:00:36.540> lashes<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:37.020> be

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
because I don't have long lashes to be

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.619 
because I don't have long lashes to be
look<00:00:37.290> in<00:00:37.530> with<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.950> have<00:00:38.489> really<00:00:38.969> short<00:00:39.360> lashes

look in with I have really short lashes
so<00:00:40.320> um<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:41.010> think<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.760> does<00:00:41.969> make<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.390> difference
