00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.070
 big pink like tin I'm cousin sun and 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.389

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.640
 I come to bring a tutorial from 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.369
 gt5 online mode of how to enter the 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.020
 best places for trolls and good ya 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.360
 know that it is a series that is in the 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.830
 channel this is the second video play it 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.910
 the number one on the bottom but 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.230
 good you're going to start with the first 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.430
 they have to come exactly to this 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.780
 place that is found show that what 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.000
 that the custom saints as you can see 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.920
 there is what the sign is and good 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.390
 this is the tunnel and well let's come 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.710
 with any vehicle that this means 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.930
 raised we're going to like in this place 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.670
 and well let's grab little travel and 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.260
 we are going to jump towards what 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.260
 is this wall and how can you see us 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.720
 we put what is this parking 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.790
 and these businesses that are at 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.140
 side of this parking lot and good 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.649
 you can walk all that is the 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.510
 part then that goes to the tunnel or what 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.730
 which is the horizontal street that is 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.770
 between entering what is the tunnel and 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.450
 you can kill people who are 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.710
 they find on the outside of what 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.440
 what is this 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.180
 blige is very well is one of those who 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.010
 I liked the truth because it is 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.200
 very broad and has many 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.000
 then options where to stand and all this 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.740
 As you can see I'm running through the 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.200
 part of what is the 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.210
 trade and well you can walk shooting 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.670
 to people in some parts you can not 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.560
 kill them but in most of them yes 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.850
 you can walk all that is the part 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.530
 also from the other block as they can 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.900
 see right here we are running by 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.759
 this side and here I can not so I 'm not going 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.990
 to start the coffee part that looks there 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.149
 because if they are not going to fall and go to 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.560
 appear outside to exit this click 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.289
 good only approach any 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.659
 wall and good, it only comes out here 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:46.399
 I was getting saturated with the pot 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.280
 but good to go with the number two 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.710
 This is very simple, if you do not have 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.689
 So much things that can be done 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.270
 inside but it's very cool to day too 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.909
 is here in the other taste in saints and 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.500
 you occupy a motorcycle no matter which 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.080
 be but preferably that they are a 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.490
 sanchez as well as the one that I have and good 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.500
 are going to get in this place that is 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.179
 found here next to the tank he cited and 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.769
 as you can see we get to what is 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.019
 this place we are all here 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.610
 inside as I say they can not shoot 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.459
 inside this place is a little more 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.230
 but yes, well, being 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.480
 escaping the patrol of someone who 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.250
 wants to kill or what he wants is to surround 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.920
 someone good then you get into this place 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.750
 and well it's not going to come out obviously like you 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.610
 you did not and you can be putting 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.049
 the rewards or you put a 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.950
 reward for some places and you can 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.480
 shoot if you want to leave this place 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.760
 in others to leave by exactly the 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.010
 same place where you went for 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.959
 do not have problems ok and good you're going to 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.830
 happen with the number 3 this topic is very 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.170
 very chingÃ³n 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.330
 only that this is in the 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.530
 skyscrapers and good what they have to 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.540
 to do is to come to this place that is 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.910
 find here is very close what is 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.920
 the cinema and the sale of shirts that is 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.600
 more or less for the middle and good part 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.330
 we have to come with a helicopter 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.250
 forcibly to this place 11 go up to 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.430
 this building that is located here and 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:06.790
 good since good since they are here they go 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.590
 to get into this little corner jumping and 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.110
 well they are going to grease what is the part 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.850
 of the interior of this building as 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.100
 you can see it looks very chinny from 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.440
 up because you do not look at the textures 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.850
 that has the walls that obviously 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.130
 They have the outside by inside not 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.840
 they look is very very zinc I like it 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.280
 very much also the only bad thing that 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.260
 have here is that you can not shoot for 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.150
 all parties out only by 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.530
 some spaces and good what you can 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.630
 do here is that you come with your friends 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.820
 and you start reputed with them or 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.819
 doing evil things or something or whatever 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.099
 but good 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.319
 I hope you liked this tutorial 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:42.560

 vehicles that when you take them to 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.500
 custom saints tells you that you can not 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.539
 because they are worth more than 50 thousand in this case 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.070
 I have adhered and well I brought it
