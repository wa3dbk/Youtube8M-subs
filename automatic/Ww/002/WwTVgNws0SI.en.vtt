00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
and dandy to build a gigantic tank which

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.360 
and dandy to build a gigantic tank which
is<00:04:45.419> like<00:04:45.599> mega<00:04:46.050> scale<00:04:46.229> it<00:04:46.530> looks<00:04:46.710> great<00:04:47.039> but

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
is like mega scale it looks great but

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.480 
is like mega scale it looks great but
then<00:04:47.639> to<00:04:48.240> not<00:04:48.479> have<00:04:48.659> enough<00:04:48.870> track<00:04:49.289> to<00:04:49.650> put<00:04:50.340> on

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
then to not have enough track to put on

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.950 
then to not have enough track to put on
it<00:04:51.860> yeah<00:04:52.860> that's<00:04:53.610> kind<00:04:54.090> of<00:04:54.150> frustrating<00:04:54.330> so<00:04:54.930> I

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
it yeah that's kind of frustrating so I

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.230 
it yeah that's kind of frustrating so I
build<00:04:55.440> my<00:04:55.830> tanks<00:04:56.310> around<00:04:56.699> the<00:04:56.909> amount<00:04:57.150> of

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
build my tanks around the amount of

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.279 
build my tanks around the amount of
track<00:04:57.599> I<00:04:57.780> have<00:04:58.400> rather<00:04:59.400> than<00:04:59.669> like<00:05:00.449> the<00:05:00.719> size<00:05:01.020> I

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:01.289 
track I have rather than like the size I

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:05.180 
track I have rather than like the size I
can<00:05:01.590> actually<00:05:01.800> do<00:05:02.190> so<00:05:03.120> that's<00:05:03.330> why<00:05:03.930> it's<00:05:04.190> kind

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
can actually do so that's why it's kind

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.689 
can actually do so that's why it's kind
of<00:05:05.310> small<00:05:05.639> but<00:05:06.289> um<00:05:07.289> yeah<00:05:08.159> that<00:05:08.190> just<00:05:08.430> about

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 
of small but um yeah that just about

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:12.559 
of small but um yeah that just about
