00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
of like the back ponytail except it's on

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.110

you can leave it down the side ponytail

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.449 
you can leave it down the side ponytail
the<00:02:53.600> difference<00:02:53.989> is<00:02:54.170> why<00:02:54.709> you<00:02:54.770> would<00:02:55.160> want<00:02:55.190> a

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
the difference is why you would want a

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.070 
the difference is why you would want a
side<00:02:55.730> ponytail<00:02:56.120> rather<00:02:56.540> than<00:02:56.750> a<00:02:56.810> back

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
side ponytail rather than a back

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.130 
side ponytail rather than a back
ponytail<00:02:57.320> it's<00:02:58.100> just<00:02:58.370> um<00:02:58.660> side<00:02:59.660> ponytail

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
ponytail it's just um side ponytail

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.160 
ponytail it's just um side ponytail
makes<00:03:00.350> your<00:03:00.560> hair<00:03:00.709> more<00:03:00.920> present<00:03:01.489> in<00:03:01.610> the<00:03:02.420> look

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
makes your hair more present in the look

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.690 
makes your hair more present in the look
because<00:03:03.440> if<00:03:03.800> you<00:03:03.920> have<00:03:04.100> your<00:03:04.280> back<00:03:04.459> ponytail

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
because if you have your back ponytail

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.090 
because if you have your back ponytail
you<00:03:05.390> can't<00:03:05.630> really<00:03:05.750> you<00:03:06.200> can't<00:03:06.500> see<00:03:06.739> most<00:03:07.010> of

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
you can't really you can't see most of

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.250 
you can't really you can't see most of
your<00:03:07.250> hair<00:03:07.459> and<00:03:07.730> so<00:03:08.360> a<00:03:08.390> side<00:03:08.630> ponytail<00:03:08.989> just

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
your hair and so a side ponytail just

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.860 
your hair and so a side ponytail just
has<00:03:09.650> the<00:03:09.830> hair<00:03:09.980> present<00:03:10.580> but<00:03:11.000> still<00:03:11.330> contained

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
has the hair present but still contained

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.630 
has the hair present but still contained
um<00:03:12.800> just<00:03:13.430> like<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:13.820> back<00:03:14.060> ponytail<00:03:14.330> you<00:03:15.170> can

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
um just like the back ponytail you can

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.120 
um just like the back ponytail you can
braid<00:03:16.640> it<00:03:16.820> and<00:03:17.060> you<00:03:17.150> can<00:03:17.300> fish<00:03:17.510> tail<00:03:17.780> it<00:03:18.130> I

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
braid it and you can fish tail it I

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.539 
braid it and you can fish tail it I
really<00:03:19.640> think<00:03:19.850> that<00:03:20.000> side<00:03:20.900> fishtail<00:03:21.549> looks

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
really think that side fishtail looks

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.640 
really think that side fishtail looks
really<00:03:23.030> to<00:03:23.480> you<00:03:23.630> and<00:03:23.840> so<00:03:24.320> that's<00:03:24.470> a<00:03:24.620> really

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
really to you and so that's a really

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.500 
really to you and so that's a really
good<00:03:24.980> look<00:03:25.220> if<00:03:25.459> you<00:03:25.610> want<00:03:25.970> to<00:03:26.060> look<00:03:26.239> really

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
good look if you want to look really

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
together and then again with the bangs

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.780 
together and then again with the bangs
you<00:03:30.739> can<00:03:30.920> just<00:03:31.250> pin<00:03:31.459> them<00:03:31.610> back<00:03:32.350> like<00:03:33.350> that<00:03:33.790> so
