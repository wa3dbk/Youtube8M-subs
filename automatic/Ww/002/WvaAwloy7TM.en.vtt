buy this if you put a mechanical hard

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.509 
buy this if you put a mechanical hard
drive<00:02:54.080> in<00:02:54.290> here<00:02:54.470> you<00:02:54.769> got<00:02:54.920> to<00:02:55.069> be<00:02:55.130> careful<00:02:55.310> with

them and if you guys have external
enclosures<00:02:57.590> for<00:02:57.709> mechanical<00:02:58.220> hard<00:02:58.400> drives

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
enclosures for mechanical hard drives

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.350 
enclosures for mechanical hard drives
realize<00:02:59.720> that<00:03:00.260> any<00:03:00.680> kind<00:03:01.069> of<00:03:01.430> light<00:03:02.060> even

realize that any kind of light even
light<00:03:02.630> bumps<00:03:03.430> can<00:03:04.430> cause<00:03:04.610> damage<00:03:04.880> to<00:03:05.090> the

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
light bumps can cause damage to the

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.479 
light bumps can cause damage to the
disks<00:03:05.599> so<00:03:05.750> just<00:03:05.930> keep<00:03:06.049> that<00:03:06.200> in<00:03:06.260> mind<00:03:06.380> so<00:03:07.099> I'm

disks so just keep that in mind so I'm

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.009 
disks so just keep that in mind so I'm
gonna<00:03:07.640> refocus<00:03:08.299> on<00:03:08.390> the<00:03:08.480> camera<00:03:08.780> here<00:03:08.959> and

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
gonna refocus on the camera here and

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.110 
gonna refocus on the camera here and
we're<00:03:09.410> gonna<00:03:09.500> put<00:03:09.650> this<00:03:09.980> all<00:03:10.549> together<00:03:10.819> I

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
we're gonna put this all together I

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.330 
we're gonna put this all together I
guess<00:03:11.450> okay<00:03:12.109> so<00:03:12.410> here<00:03:12.590> we<00:03:12.620> have<00:03:12.739> it<00:03:13.040> and<00:03:13.280> the

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
pull out the top you align it properly

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:28.090 
pull out the top you align it properly
with<00:03:21.620> your<00:03:21.950> drive<00:03:24.190> that<00:03:25.190> way<00:03:26.650> if<00:03:27.650> I<00:03:27.769> can<00:03:27.799> get<00:03:28.010> it

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
with your drive that way if I can get it

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.920 
with your drive that way if I can get it
in<00:03:28.190> there<00:03:28.370> there<00:03:28.609> we<00:03:28.670> go<00:03:28.790> but<00:03:29.390> easier<00:03:29.720> than<00:03:29.840> I

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
in there there we go but easier than I

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.210 
in there there we go but easier than I
just<00:03:30.109> made<00:03:30.260> that<00:03:30.380> seam<00:03:30.590> I'll<00:03:30.769> be<00:03:30.890> honest<00:03:31.100> with

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139 
gonna do is we'll take a look at the

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:57.099 
gonna do is we'll take a look at the
software<00:03:54.470> next<00:03:54.889> and<00:03:55.209> maybe<00:03:56.209> try<00:03:56.540> to<00:03:56.600> throw<00:03:56.959> an

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:57.109 
software next and maybe try to throw an

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:00.490 
software next and maybe try to throw an
ISO<00:03:57.410> on<00:03:57.440> there<00:03:58.090> okay<00:03:59.090> guys<00:03:59.269> so<00:03:59.540> how<00:04:00.019> do<00:04:00.079> you<00:04:00.260> use

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
ISO on there okay guys so how do you use

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.460 
ISO on there okay guys so how do you use
this<00:04:00.739> you<00:04:01.010> can<00:04:01.489> use<00:04:01.850> the<00:04:02.150> backup<00:04:02.690> utility<00:04:03.290> tool

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
this you can use the backup utility tool

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.500 
this you can use the backup utility tool
from<00:04:03.739> Zalman<00:04:04.220> so<00:04:04.430> you<00:04:04.519> can<00:04:04.670> backup<00:04:04.970> you<00:04:05.480> can

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
from Zalman so you can backup you can

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.420 
from Zalman so you can backup you can
create<00:04:05.840> virtual<00:04:06.139> hard<00:04:06.590> drives<00:04:06.859> which<00:04:07.250> is

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
create virtual hard drives which is

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.009 
create virtual hard drives which is
really<00:04:07.819> cool<00:04:08.030> if<00:04:08.269> you<00:04:08.389> want<00:04:08.569> to<00:04:08.630> do<00:04:08.750> things

to install an OS Windows OS and you want
to<00:04:18.590> boot<00:04:18.739> to<00:04:18.890> this<00:04:19.010> virtual<00:04:19.400> hard<00:04:19.609> drive<00:04:19.760> you

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
to boot to this virtual hard drive you

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.509 
to boot to this virtual hard drive you
can<00:04:20.299> do

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
can do

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:21.979 
can do
on<00:04:20.729> this<00:04:20.910> so<00:04:21.329> you<00:04:21.419> could<00:04:21.539> take<00:04:21.660> it<00:04:21.780> along<00:04:21.930> with

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
on this so you could take it along with

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
screen just put it in backwards then you

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:51.019 
screen just put it in backwards then you
flip<00:05:46.949> it<00:05:46.979> around<00:05:47.099> with<00:05:47.340> everyone<00:05:49.190> but<00:05:50.190> it's

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
like a stack of DVDs and get it down to

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.850 
like a stack of DVDs and get it down to
this<00:05:55.259> size<00:05:55.610> make<00:05:56.610> them<00:05:56.909> quicker<00:05:57.479> because<00:05:57.930> the

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
this size make them quicker because the

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.499 
this size make them quicker because the
hard<00:05:59.039> drive<00:05:59.250> on<00:05:59.279> here<00:05:59.759> is<00:05:59.880> gonna<00:06:00.060> read<00:06:00.300> a<00:06:00.330> lot

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:00.509 
hard drive on here is gonna read a lot

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:03.019 
hard drive on here is gonna read a lot
of<00:06:00.569> faster<00:06:00.990> than<00:06:01.139> an<00:06:01.229> optical<00:06:01.710> drive<00:06:01.860> it<00:06:02.699> means

00:06:03.019 --> 00:06:03.029 
of faster than an optical drive it means

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:05.779 
of faster than an optical drive it means
that<00:06:03.539> it's<00:06:04.319> more<00:06:04.560> portable<00:06:04.830> I<00:06:05.310> can<00:06:05.460> take<00:06:05.669> it

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:05.789 
that it's more portable I can take it

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:08.059 
that it's more portable I can take it
with<00:06:05.909> me<00:06:06.060> where<00:06:06.270> I'm<00:06:06.389> going<00:06:06.779> if<00:06:07.289> I<00:06:07.440> travel<00:06:07.949> I
