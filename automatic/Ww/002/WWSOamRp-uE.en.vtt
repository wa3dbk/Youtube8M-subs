00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 hello we are in Munich at htc and 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.610
 here we have the new htc when that 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.380
 device was in the apron at least something 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.450
 the specifications are connected to the internet 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.929
 it is actually about 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.640
 a 472 big smartphone with one 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.140
 new design what a bit one 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.740
 blackberry or iphone only race 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.720
 a little bit 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.939
 do not mean exactly hinguckt there are 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.609
 some differences 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:29.039
 The device has a speed of 1.7 GHz 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.800
 qualcomm snapdragon 600 that's one 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.090
 new cpu from qualcomm a tcs and everyone 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.910
 match is pretty much the first manufacturer 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.070
 the stone sets the night with 1.7 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.110
 ghz and that's a real bolide because 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.840
 makes encoding benchmark times out 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.890
 12,000 points 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.140
 that is a very decent value for 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.590
 a smartphone is from the quad core it is 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:54.989
 two gigabytes of mainboard are added 32 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:58.649
 gigabyte flash memory and a 4.7 inches 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.539
 big as I said full hd display the 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.350
 is a super lcd 3 that is pleasant 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:07.770
 bright also very sharp because of the 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.530
 pixel density of 440 about a bit 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.880
 more than 140 percent 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.049
 I do not believe the human eye 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.720
 keep up more and any more 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.299
 recognize differences 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.299
 we'll take a quick look at rom and ask 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.979
 it is clear that here a 2 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.630
 Megapixel camera sits in the middle 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.939
 is located in loudspeakers grill and 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.659
 to the left of it sit one 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.190
 notification ali that had the 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.140
 be right that is left 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.520
 with sensors then we have this 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.190
 nice big screen with one 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.880
 relatively narrow frame can now 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.410
 not quite with the really narrowest 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.800
 I keep up with industry standards 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.600
 times 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.220
 at the bottom is a 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.520
 another speaker is part of one 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.280
 thing that calls itself better and that 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.200
 whole is very very good sound that is 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.340
 93 decibels that come from it is too 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.510
 even a little something must exist 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.600
 you can still with us shortly after 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.760
 look louder than the iphone 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:04.800
 and sounds very good, I have to say 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:06.360
 on the front briefly mentioned htc sense 5 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.690
 then comes in the simplified are 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.270
 therefore still of course a 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.120
 adaptation of htc by android runs here 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.100
 Android 4.1.1 Libya still should 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:23.010
 pretty soon an update on the 42nd 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:24.840
 or 24 22 of course that 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.540
 design is a bit slimmed down 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.110
 were not quite as colorful as 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.350
 earlier 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.790
 and on top of these homescreen it is 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.790
 actually no slipping but it is 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:39.480
 be a son under blinking feed there 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.010
 news and updates from the internet 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.650
 So from facebook, how to get here 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.390
 but also sees news from 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.310
 various sources you can own 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.130
 htc adds its own 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.250
 server and better to say just that 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.560
 gets under patters and at the bottom 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.420
 then there are also calendars 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.200
 updates and similar stuff one has 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:04.530
 but still the typical 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.570
 menu bar down from there again 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.540
 a back button and a homebutton 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.380
 htc has the multitasking switch times 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.150
 just deleted 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:20.730
 The call of google new is done via 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:22.320
 hold the home key and long 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.350
 switch between different tests 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.280
 I find it a bit hard at the moment 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.750
 but as I said we wanted 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.190
 actually prefer to print the device 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.160
 and do it on the left side 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:35.190
 further up there we have the mikros 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.340
 import below it goes on with one 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:41.310
 micro sd micro usb connection and one 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.530
 the microphone on the right side 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.850
 a fabricated all 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.000
 volume control and at the top edge 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:50.520
 we still have the headphone jack 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.050
 and has the power button of the construction work 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.819
 a special property is the 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.130
 namely plastic and transparent 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:59.240
 behind it sits an infrared blaster 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.990
 so that you can over the device any 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.880
 stereos television and all 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.709
 possible other devices are just 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.959
 via classic remote control 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.100
 Remote control can be remotely controlled 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:12.840
 works very well there is one 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:14.610
 own app to the program lists 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.039
 created and gets so that on the 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.760
 phone in principle only on the 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:19.799
 respective to the respective broadcast 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.030
 must press and the phone is then 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.610
 also the suitable transmitter automatically 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:27.450
 on 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:31.830
 The phone is 93 mm thick 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:34.760
 the largest parts made of aluminum are still available 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.890
 say one page to the pages in 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.180
 wÃ¼rzbacher goes namely to scarce 4 mm 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.750
 down or butter four millimeters 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.960
 down the battery has 2300 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:48.570
 millennia and was allowed with the 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.550
 dickens networking under normal 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.930
 hopefully use the day through 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.140
 but it probably will 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.400
 get a little close 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:59.550
 a special feature of this device disassembled 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.960
 htc is synonymous with great importance 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.979
 the ultra pixel camera on the back 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.870
 which has 24 megapixels in total but the 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:08.310
 Pixels are supposed to be twice as big as 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.810
 in an 8 megapixel camera the 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.240
 sensors are basically the same 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.940
 big but htc can be just more space 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.830
 on this sensor and can do it more 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.560
 light to catch completely 20 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.820
 Aperture should be much better 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.479
 make pictures darker than for example 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:27.320
 in galaxy s3 okay that's the htc man 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:27.320
 see again
