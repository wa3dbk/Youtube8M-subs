00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 is the horror game of the moment 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.770
 game that we all hope will come out for 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.189
 scream like never before we had 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.189
 fact 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:18.359
 very good guys and girls I'm cute 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:22.369
 and I extract 10 little things that surely 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.369
 you know the fight night phoenix 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.800
 number 1 is cautious or has not made public the 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.660
 map of fight night sa fredys 3 what 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.250
 not appreciated in the original image are 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.260
 the small tubes ducts 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.910
 ventilation that is joining all the 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.680
 rooms this can be appreciated 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.380
 raising the contrast of the photo that has 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.210
 put on your website in the same way 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.430
 an even more curious thing about this map 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.980
 is that if we turn it over it looks like 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.900
 much to the character that has cleavage in 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.640
 your image of the youtube channel that 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.740
 it also happens to be one of the characters 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.530
 of his first games 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.570
 number 2 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.579
 scott already had some games to his 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.350
 backs before having made five 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.150
 knights of ladies but these games 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.770
 They always had bad reviews about everything 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.159
 by the fact that the characters do not 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.869
 they seemed really characters but 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.899
 Animatronics with unreal movements 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.970
 unnatural and little fluid picked 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:19.399
 all these bad reviews and forged to its 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.799
 around a story a universe a 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:23.899
 world that eventually ended up naming fight 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:27.130
 night sap freddy and is the game that 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:27.130
 we have today in our hands 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.050
 number 3 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.330
 like any good game that claims fight 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.850
 night sab prebisch has its little ones 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.350
 tricks and their little codes on the menu 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.580
 main of both games you can 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:45.190
 keep pressing the c / d and 1 keys to 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:49.510
 unlock the sixth night or you can 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:52.240
 keep cd2 to unlock the night 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:56.350
 Personalized also within the game 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.820
 you can press c / d and the key more to 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.410
 automatically pass the night that 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.000
 are you playing 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.580
 this could also be used in fainÃ© 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.830
 credits but with a small variant 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.840
 before entering the code you had to go 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.270
 to the poster on the left where I was 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.680
 Fred's nose and click and without 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.910
 stop raising the click once 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.080
 would have sounded that sound so 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:20.290
 characteristic press c / d and the key more 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.940
 so it would happen to the next night the 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.330
 problem of this sound is that some 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.940
 people like me have a problem 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:31.140
 Mostly this problem heh heh heh heh heh 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.140
 hehe 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.510
 number 4 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.610
 now it seems normal to complete the night 7 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.830
 personalized night with everything to the fullest 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.260
 but in the first country knights of ladies 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.209
 scott believes it totally impossible 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.099
 when a youtuber showed that if it was 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.230
 able put the third one on the menu 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.910
 star as a reward for all 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.629
 people who had the courage to 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.340
 finish tonight number 5 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:57.260
 scott not only knows how to take good care of 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.299
 history but also knows how to take care 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.160
 very good the little details by 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.079
 example in the newspaper we can see how 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.209
 in the blurred areas there are written 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:07.459
 several things that a careful eye can 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.040
 discover and take a little laugh 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.019
 in this case blah blah blah this ad not 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.849
 has nothing to do with the game blah blah 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.250
 blah there are many chances that 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:18.500
 you do not even pass the night 3 blah blah 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.269
 since maybe I removed the speech this 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.890
 surely it is not the best job 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.599
 you can choose in summer because 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.420
 surely he does not even survive that 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:28.879
 week I recommend you to be a cashier a 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.709
 dealer or works in a warehouse are 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:33.109
 really respectable jobs and 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.989
 surely do not die in it good what 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:37.270
 better but it would not be the same blah blah 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.530
 blah 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.660
 number 6 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.209
 the sounds of the animatronics are 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.440
 children for example this laugh that you hear 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:49.660
 once in a while when sister ex 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.280
 it's exactly freddy's laugh 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.280
 only that cloud 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.640
 likewise the cries of 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.650
 Animatronics are also screams 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.150
 distorted of children if we take the 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.130
 whole cry that is in the archives 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.400
 of the game you can differentiate a lot 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.400
 best 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.230
 number 7 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.870
 in a foreseeable beginning to have a 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.610
 system of lives but I think the game 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:26.110
 it is already quite complicated in itself 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:27.700
 what better not to record number 8 the end those 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:33.130
 forecasts and in the personalized night 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:35.500
 meteis 1987 due to bite 87th 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.330
 a screamer will come out and automatically that 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.700
 the game will be made extra because of 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.040
 golden freddy this the beginning was not 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.810
 well but because of the false rumors and 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.130
 the false stories of several users 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.500
 scott in one of the updates 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.590
 added this is crime to silence the 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:53.050
 mouths of all the false stories 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.820
 number 9 as we already said scott 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.190
 cartoon created several games before 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.380
 fight night sad fredys one of them a 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.570
 Role play for mobile also used 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.640
 the same 8-bit theme that is 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.800
 they use in the mini arcade games of 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.930
 five knights up birdies 2 and surely 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.480
 these scenes that come out when you die 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:13.180
 use up to the same motor as said 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.370
 mobile game number 10 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.419
 what am I animatronics were ready 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.610
 in the first five 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:20.680
 freddy but scott did not know where to fit 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.570
 and I leave you for what he called the 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.669
 2015 sequel 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.880
 at the end the sequel to 2015 came out in 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:30.310
 2014 and it turned out to be a prequel to weigh 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.110
 to put that was a great reopening like that 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.539
 that we have a place in fight night 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.850
 freddy even older than the end of 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:39.160
 credits and the great reopening that said 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.500
 faith nets to credits in 2015 at the end 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.630
 is the five gates to fred and 3 that 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.370
 it really is a great reopening as 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.840
 attraction of terror can be that scott 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.940
 is improvising on the fly the 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.740
 history can not be that we really 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:54.360
 have totally lost from the 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.360
 beginning be playing with us 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.580
 if you liked the video please leave me a 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.300
 good like comment your opinion in the 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.430

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:08.139

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.880
 every day a video and die of 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:11.860
 laugh or find out about interesting things 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.870
 a little more than adding boys and girls 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:17.520
 I'm celindas, I hope you have 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.520
 enjoyed and until next time 

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:29.059
 for me
