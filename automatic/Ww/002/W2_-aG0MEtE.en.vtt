 parents while she ended up being raised 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.840
 by daniel's parents 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.390
 what made her come closer is what she did 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.119
 I have not gotten closer yet. 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.310
 so lets think I have not since the 14 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.000
 she is completely in love with 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.579
 he 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.680
 only he always see her as a sister 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.520
 she was tired of this not knowing what 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.590
 do 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.600

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.759
 Call up to 10 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.680
 Directran worked with him too. 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.570
 in this neighborhood he never never never 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.080
 let her sing she was very 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.080
 riled up 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.180
 That's it, but he did not face Jorge either. 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.090
 with a gay friend of hers who by the way is the 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.260
 My favorite character from the book was alive. 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.630
 saying that she had to take a 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.619
 attitude and she never take that kind of 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.680
 attitude 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.620
 until one day Daniel was traveling with 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.370
 another partner and they were alone 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.890
 no bar 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.170
 the lead singer of the band who already played ftd 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.510
 after dark 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.000
 he just disappeared to make a 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.670
 initiatory journey at last 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.380
 and then an opportunity for her to sing already 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.400
 that dn was not around did not have 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.240
 danger, right? 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.150
 She talked to a father and she went to ask 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.560
 pro rap who is one of the partners of what is a 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.440
 of bar members 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.850
 she was asking to sing rap not 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.180
 I wanted to leave so he was with 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.400
 fear of becoming a beast but it already existed 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:55.470
 so the roriz preferred to let the singing 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:57.570
 in the end she only won what she needed 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.000
 of a little help she was always there 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.430

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.290

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.480
 this starts to open the window open is a 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.180
 vision, she was able to see how 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.519
 I felt happy doing it and then a 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.280
 talk to Jorge, she decides to go 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:46.260
 to leave aside is not the feeling that 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.739
 I have why she thinks it's impossible. 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.830
 she's crazy because he does not want to but she goes 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.750
 let it all go if everything relaxes 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.620
