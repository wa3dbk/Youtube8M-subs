00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
so I mean this is why I like playing

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.850 
so I mean this is why I like playing
like<00:01:10.020> people<00:01:10.320> who<00:01:10.380> know<00:01:10.530> what<00:01:10.560> they're<00:01:10.710> doing

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
like people who know what they're doing

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.280 
like people who know what they're doing
because<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.549> always<00:01:11.760> got<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.210> switch<00:01:12.450> up<00:01:12.479> so

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
because you always got to switch up so

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.260 
because you always got to switch up so
his<00:01:13.619> defense<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.189> going<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.460> be<00:01:14.549> pretty<00:01:14.850> much<00:01:15.119> I

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
his defense is going to be pretty much I

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.600 
his defense is going to be pretty much I
think<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.570> zone<00:01:15.930> where<00:01:15.960> up<00:01:16.740> he's<00:01:17.280> gonna<00:01:17.430> pretty

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
think a zone where up he's gonna pretty

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.359 
think a zone where up he's gonna pretty
much<00:01:17.700> played<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.060> deep<00:01:18.299> pass<00:01:18.570> so<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:19.170> think<00:01:20.100> he's

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
much played a deep pass so I think he's

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.999 
much played a deep pass so I think he's
running<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.850> nick<00:01:21.090> or<00:01:21.270> down<00:01:21.630> he<00:01:21.869> might<00:01:21.900> be<00:01:22.350> I'm

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
running a nick or down he might be I'm

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.130 
running a nick or down he might be I'm
just<00:01:23.159> not<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:24.090> good<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.600> picking<00:01:25.020> out

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
just not that that good and picking out

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.410 
just not that that good and picking out
my<00:01:25.259> defenses<00:01:25.979> so<00:01:26.460> what<00:01:26.640> I'm<00:01:26.759> going<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.000> do<00:01:27.240> is

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
my defenses so what I'm going to do is

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.550 
my defenses so what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:01:27.540> going<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.720> dip<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.049> off<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.970> my<00:01:29.970> Titan

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
I'm going to dip it off to my Titan

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.700 
I'm going to dip it off to my Titan
right<00:01:31.560> now<00:01:32.420> and<00:01:33.420> it's<00:01:34.200> gonna<00:01:34.350> be<00:01:34.439> like<00:01:34.680> a

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
right now and it's gonna be like a

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.770 
right now and it's gonna be like a
3-yard<00:01:35.369> play<00:01:35.700> but<00:01:36.030> this<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.329> what's<00:01:36.540> going<00:01:36.689> to

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
3-yard play but this is what's going to

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.870
