00:06:13.989 --> 00:06:13.999 
besides that now I'm trying to aim at

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:16.809 
besides that now I'm trying to aim at
the<00:06:14.180> tank<00:06:14.749> guy<00:06:15.009> the<00:06:16.009> guy<00:06:16.159> on<00:06:16.249> top<00:06:16.430> of<00:06:16.520> the<00:06:16.580> tank

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:16.819 
the tank guy the guy on top of the tank

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:18.909 
the tank guy the guy on top of the tank
and<00:06:17.089> it<00:06:17.509> wasn't<00:06:17.899> working<00:06:18.020> out<00:06:18.289> too<00:06:18.469> well<00:06:18.499> but

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:18.919 
and it wasn't working out too well but

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:23.499 
and it wasn't working out too well but
here<00:06:19.370> you<00:06:19.639> know<00:06:21.370> once<00:06:22.370> he's<00:06:22.550> going<00:06:22.789> to<00:06:22.969> despite

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:23.509 
here you know once he's going to despite

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:25.089 
here you know once he's going to despite
because<00:06:23.809> more<00:06:24.020> manageable<00:06:24.559> there's<00:06:24.889> only<00:06:25.009> one

00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:25.099 
because more manageable there's only one

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:27.429 
because more manageable there's only one
rocket<00:06:25.669> launcher<00:06:25.999> guy<00:06:26.149> so<00:06:27.050> that's<00:06:27.229> not<00:06:27.379> too

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:27.439 
rocket launcher guy so that's not too

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:32.800
