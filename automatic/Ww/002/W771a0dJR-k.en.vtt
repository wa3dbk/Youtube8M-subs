00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
on but yeah so first of all my class

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.090 
on but yeah so first of all my class
setup<00:01:38.369> is<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.759> ACR<00:01:39.150> Sansa<00:01:39.689> my<00:01:40.290> secondary<00:01:40.770> is

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
setup is the ACR Sansa my secondary is

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.149 
setup is the ACR Sansa my secondary is
PE<00:01:41.549> Maxima<00:01:42.240> kimbos<00:01:42.659> or<00:01:43.350> maybe<00:01:43.500> just<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.829> magnum

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
PE Maxima kimbos or maybe just a magnum

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:44.990 
PE Maxima kimbos or maybe just a magnum
and<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.369> think<00:01:44.549> of

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
and I think of

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.780 
and I think of
the<00:01:45.090> Kimber<00:01:45.390> at<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:45.750> stage<00:01:45.930> yet<00:01:46.190> I'm<00:01:47.190> running

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
the Kimber at this stage yet I'm running

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.160 
the Kimber at this stage yet I'm running
extreme<00:01:48.060> conditioning<00:01:48.600> just<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.900> get<00:01:49.050> that

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
extreme conditioning just to get that

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.920 
extreme conditioning just to get that
extra<00:01:49.230> distance<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:50.130> hard<00:01:50.850> line<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:51.570> can<00:01:51.780> get

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
extra distance a hard line so I can get

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.440 
extra distance a hard line so I can get
those<00:01:52.110> perks<00:01:52.830> easier<00:01:53.340> if<00:01:54.120> you<00:01:54.240> don't<00:01:54.330> know

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
those perks easier if you don't know

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.130 
those perks easier if you don't know

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
what a scrub package is it's pretty much

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.080 
what a scrub package is it's pretty much
when<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.260> hit<00:01:58.500> two<00:01:58.710> kills<00:01:59.010> you'll<00:01:59.310> get<00:01:59.790> upper

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
circles and you'll slowly slowly get a

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.280 
circles and you'll slowly slowly get a
rhythm<00:03:50.310> for<00:03:50.640> it<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:50.970> they'll<00:03:51.720> start<00:03:51.990> to<00:03:52.200> you

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
know keep coming to you and instead of

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.670 
know keep coming to you and instead of
you<00:03:54.960> running<00:03:55.260> to<00:03:55.380> them<00:03:55.530> they'll<00:03:55.740> come<00:03:55.950> to<00:03:56.100> you

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
you running to them they'll come to you

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.040

it's<00:03:58.680> a<00:03:58.800> really<00:03:59.100> nice<00:03:59.220> method<00:03:59.760> are<00:04:00.240> you<00:04:00.480> sort

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
it's a really nice method are you sort

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.050 
it's a really nice method are you sort
of<00:04:01.110> have<00:04:01.230> check<00:04:01.500> it<00:04:01.650> back<00:04:01.860> every<00:04:02.670> hour<00:04:02.820> and

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
of have check it back every hour and

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.390 
of have check it back every hour and
then<00:04:03.210> just<00:04:03.510> like<00:04:03.630> that<00:04:03.660> but<00:04:04.620> most<00:04:04.980> of<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:05.130> time

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
then just like that but most of the time

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.130 
then just like that but most of the time
you<00:04:05.700> would<00:04:06.540> you<00:04:07.440> would<00:04:07.620> get<00:04:07.800> to<00:04:07.890> kill<00:04:08.100> off<00:04:09.140> but

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
you would you would get to kill off but

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.110 
you would you would get to kill off but
yeah<00:04:10.350> just<00:04:10.590> keep<00:04:10.830> on<00:04:10.950> a<00:04:11.040> map<00:04:11.250> in<00:04:11.580> the<00:04:11.610> farm<00:04:11.940> so

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120
