00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
wheels wheels are they're pretty soft

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.500 
wheels wheels are they're pretty soft
they<00:00:23.160> come<00:00:23.369> with<00:00:23.400> some<00:00:23.699> some<00:00:24.150> pretty<00:00:24.359> good

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.300 
they come with some some pretty good
stock<00:00:24.840> bearings<00:00:25.260> but<00:00:25.439> I<00:00:25.500> think<00:00:25.740> I'm<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.890> switch

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
stock bearings but I think I'm a switch

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.640 
stock bearings but I think I'm a switch
them<00:00:26.490> out<00:00:26.519> people<00:00:27.060> are<00:00:27.150> saying<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.650> reds

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
them out people are saying the reds

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.439 
them out people are saying the reds
bearings<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.160> bone<00:00:29.429> red<00:00:29.670> or<00:00:30.150> whatever

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
bearings the bone red or whatever

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.959 
bearings the bone red or whatever
they're<00:00:30.599> called<00:00:30.630> they're<00:00:31.289> real<00:00:31.500> good<00:00:31.940> so<00:00:32.940> I

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
they're called they're real good so I

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.040 
they're called they're real good so I
think<00:00:33.120> my<00:00:33.329> switch<00:00:33.600> those<00:00:33.840> bearings<00:00:34.170> out<00:00:36.050> and

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
think my switch those bearings out and

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.060 
think my switch those bearings out and
then<00:00:37.230> they<00:00:37.350> get<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.590> trucks<00:00:38.809> with<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.260> penny

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
then they get the trucks with the penny

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.310 
then they get the trucks with the penny
