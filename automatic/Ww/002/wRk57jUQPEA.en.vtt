also you'll find that the edges are a

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.840 
also you'll find that the edges are a
little<00:00:46.260> more<00:00:46.500> tapered<00:00:46.800> kind<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.550> come<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.789> a

little more tapered kind of come to a

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.459 
little more tapered kind of come to a
rounder<00:00:48.180> point<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.629> front<00:00:48.930> here<00:00:49.110> oddly

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
rounder point of the front here oddly

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.479 
rounder point of the front here oddly
enough<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.649> doesn't<00:00:50.039> mean<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.190> phone<00:00:50.340> is

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
enough that doesn't mean the phone is

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.189 
enough that doesn't mean the phone is
just<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:51.059> little<00:00:51.300> bit<00:00:51.449> thicker<00:00:51.690> here<00:00:51.989> in<00:00:52.110> the
