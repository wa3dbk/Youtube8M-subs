hi Gilligan with big flowers calm today

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.590 
hi Gilligan with big flowers calm today
like<00:00:04.830> to<00:00:04.980> demonstrate<00:00:05.130> an<00:00:05.730> arrangement<00:00:06.210> that

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
like to demonstrate an arrangement that

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.230 
like to demonstrate an arrangement that
would<00:00:07.080> be<00:00:07.230> perfect<00:00:07.560> as<00:00:07.950> a<00:00:08.010> centerpiece<00:00:08.550> for<00:00:09.179> a

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
would be perfect as a centerpiece for a

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.310 
would be perfect as a centerpiece for a
spring<00:00:09.570> way<00:00:09.840> I've<00:00:10.340> chosen<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.790> five<00:00:12.330> by<00:00:12.660> five<00:00:12.960> by

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
spring way I've chosen a five by five by

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.970 
spring way I've chosen a five by five by
five<00:00:13.590> square<00:00:14.099> base<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:15.049> I've<00:00:16.049> already<00:00:16.289> filled

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
five square base and I've already filled

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.980 
five square base and I've already filled
it<00:00:17.130> with<00:00:17.160> water<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.820> I'd<00:00:17.970> wrapped<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.800> tea<00:00:19.800> leaf

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
it with water and I'd wrapped a tea leaf

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.480 
it with water and I'd wrapped a tea leaf
inside<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.140> base<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.619> sucked<00:00:23.039> it<00:00:23.130> down<00:00:23.310> in

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
inside the base and sucked it down in

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.359 
inside the base and sucked it down in
there<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:24.230> then<00:00:25.230> remember<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.830> mechanics<00:00:26.279> of

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
there and then remember the mechanics of

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.370 
there and then remember the mechanics of
the<00:00:26.490> base<00:00:26.670> it's<00:00:26.939> really<00:00:27.210> good<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.390> take<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.960> grid

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
the base it's really good to take a grid

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.900 
the base it's really good to take a grid
on<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.740> top<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.039> your<00:00:29.220> base<00:00:29.400> this<00:00:29.640> will<00:00:29.789> help

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
on the top of your base this will help

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.400 
on the top of your base this will help
all<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.330> your<00:00:30.449> flowers<00:00:30.840> stay<00:00:31.050> in<00:00:31.170> place

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
all of your flowers stay in place

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.569 
all of your flowers stay in place
especially<00:00:32.279> when<00:00:32.730> you're<00:00:32.880> transporting<00:00:33.149> them

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
especially when you're transporting them

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.340 
especially when you're transporting them
I've<00:00:35.579> chosen<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:36.210> bright<00:00:36.510> colored<00:00:36.899> tulip

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
I've chosen a bright colored tulip

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.040 
I've chosen a bright colored tulip
they're<00:00:38.070> really<00:00:38.219> just<00:00:38.370> simple<00:00:39.300> Dutch<00:00:39.510> tulips

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
they're really just simple Dutch tulips

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.590 
they're really just simple Dutch tulips
and<00:00:40.230> I've<00:00:40.500> already<00:00:40.739> stripped<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.940> leaves<00:00:42.210> off

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
and I've already stripped the leaves off

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.560 
and I've already stripped the leaves off
of<00:00:42.660> several<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.559> these<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:44.040> wanted<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.300> show<00:00:45.539> you

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
that sometimes in this bottom leaf of

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.229 
that sometimes in this bottom leaf of
every<00:00:48.300> tool<00:00:48.539> if<00:00:49.309> you<00:00:50.309> get<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.579> sediment<00:00:51.090> or

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
every tool if you get the sediment or

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.209 
every tool if you get the sediment or

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
the church at the bottom of the stem

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.709 
the church at the bottom of the stem
there<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.789> do<00:00:54.030> need<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.300> rinse<00:00:54.539> your

wipe them off so that the sediment

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.270 
wipe them off so that the sediment
doesn't<00:01:01.230> settle<00:01:01.530> at<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.800> bottom<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:02.219> your

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
water in the bottom of the base so so

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.850 
water in the bottom of the base so so
now<00:01:09.270> I'm<00:01:09.360> going<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.750> cut<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.290> I'm<00:01:10.380> going<00:01:10.830> to

too tall you want to be able to see over

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.130 
too tall you want to be able to see over
the<00:01:23.460> arrangement<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.780> person

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
the arrangement to the to the person

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.219 
the arrangement to the to the person
across<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.530> table<00:01:25.740> from<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:27.110> and<00:01:28.110> I'm

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
across the table from you so and I'm

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.920 
across the table from you so and I'm
really<00:01:28.530> just<00:01:28.650> kind<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:28.979> angling<00:01:29.490> them<00:01:29.670> out

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
really just kind of angling them out

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.609 
really just kind of angling them out
three<00:01:30.930> dimensionally<00:01:33.259> sometimes<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.409> get<00:01:34.500> an

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
three dimensionally sometimes you get an

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.950 
three dimensionally sometimes you get an
occasional<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.310> lift<00:01:35.520> this<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:36.000> little<00:01:36.780> bit

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
occasional to lift this a little bit

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.800 
occasional to lift this a little bit
distressed<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:37.979> can<00:01:38.130> either<00:01:38.659> repair<00:01:39.659> it

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
distressed and you can either repair it

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.289 
distressed and you can either repair it
or<00:01:39.960> actually<00:01:40.470> pull<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.979> bottom<00:01:41.189> leaf<00:01:41.729> off<00:01:42.000> and

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
or actually pull the bottom leaf off and

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.880 
or actually pull the bottom leaf off and
then<00:01:42.479> place<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:42.869> in<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.610> arrangement

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
then place it in the arrangement

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:52.240 
then place it in the arrangement
strategically<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.159> don't<00:01:47.340> see<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:47.630> stem

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.190 

I'm<00:01:53.250> just<00:01:53.490> cutting<00:01:55.490> placing<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:57.020> I'm<00:01:58.020> going

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
I'm just cutting placing and I'm going

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.870 
I'm just cutting placing and I'm going
to<00:01:58.260> keep<00:01:58.440> rotating<00:01:58.680> my<00:01:59.159> arrangement<00:01:59.700> around

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
to keep rotating my arrangement around

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.730 
to keep rotating my arrangement around
to<00:02:00.090> make<00:02:00.240> sure<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:00.810> looks<00:02:01.049> three

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
to make sure that it looks three

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.760 
to make sure that it looks three
dimensionally<00:02:02.400> correct<00:02:06.380> juleps<00:02:07.380> are<00:02:07.560> fine

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
dimensionally correct juleps are fine

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.600 
dimensionally correct juleps are fine
they<00:02:08.069> add<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.459> lot<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.030> color<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.810> room

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
they add a lot of color to the room

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.270 
they add a lot of color to the room
they're<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.850> one<00:02:12.120> flower<00:02:12.980> that<00:02:13.980> will

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
they're the one flower that will

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.510 
they're the one flower that will
continue<00:02:14.819> to<00:02:15.120> grow<00:02:15.239> in<00:02:15.630> water<00:02:15.870> so<00:02:16.800> if<00:02:17.340> you're

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
continue to grow in water so if you're

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.430 
continue to grow in water so if you're
going<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.700> make<00:02:17.819> these<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.209> day<00:02:18.360> before<00:02:18.540> you

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.710 
going to make these the day before you
have<00:02:19.620> an<00:02:19.739> event<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:20.310> probably<00:02:21.000> need<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.420> cut

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
have an event you probably need to cut

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.060 
have an event you probably need to cut
them<00:02:21.870> down<00:02:21.900> again<00:02:22.200> because<00:02:22.590> they<00:02:22.709> will<00:02:22.890> have

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
them down again because they will have

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.729 
them down again because they will have
grown<00:02:23.310> already<00:02:23.870> and<00:02:24.870> once<00:02:25.110> they<00:02:25.260> get<00:02:25.380> into<00:02:25.530> the

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.970 
grown already and once they get into the
warm<00:02:25.980> air<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:27.870> head<00:02:28.080> of<00:02:28.200> his<00:02:28.290> tulip<00:02:28.680> is<00:02:28.830> just

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
warm air the head of his tulip is just

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.180 
warm air the head of his tulip is just
going<00:02:29.100> to<00:02:29.160> pop<00:02:29.370> right<00:02:29.640> open<00:02:33.860> couple<00:02:34.860> more<00:02:35.010> here
