00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.070
 Pachiko's video 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.890
 Next time too 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.489
 It is Gun- chan t 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:41.120
 It's getting sunny and I'm starting to get fresh and pairing my feet 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.650
 Well round and round over a single line Kedomo is Mitan Move 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.740
 There is 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.220
 I tried to get rid of it 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.990
 A little lonely 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.750
 That's it this time 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:57.980
 It's here 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:01:03.829
 This is also their guy though Elementary School is double-track bewitching dress set 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:05.560
 It turns around the outside of the endless set m 1 bought by this 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:09.250
 With 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:15.399
 The cheekbones of the cello I bought after the war 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:18.100
 Since I bought the Cassiopeia and 2 Parko we want to it well passing is not ne both the 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:23.350
 First of all, double track 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:25.550
 Here is the end base set to prevent outside 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.400
 It is everybody who buys this It is this 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:34.380
 I had high do if there is a 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:39.000
 That on the outside m 1 dress set is entered on the inside 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:43.800
 When the track of the line enters and it becomes possible to run by passing 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.460
 Let's try duplicating the fingers below in terms of ridges 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:52.020
 I would like to cosponsor the foreshadowing 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.880
 In Well I this is I know the sound of the use foreshadowing Knox little is I package is in this set 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:01.680
 There is no such thing 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:03.820
 So I bought a power pack like a track for the outside separately, isn't it? 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.560

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.700
 Things are quite 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:18.690
 Because what you have not decided yet on whether you try to fine the various c month what kind of fluoride form 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.810
 Although the materials for the cityscape and the like are not done so much, for the time being 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:27.000
 And the line to struggle from a single game 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:31.610
