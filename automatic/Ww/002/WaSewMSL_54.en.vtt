where the navigation and the climate

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.740 
where the navigation and the climate
control<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.460> found<00:01:14.670> it's<00:01:15.060> been<00:01:15.270> angled

slightly<00:01:15.960> towards<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.100> driver<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.670> that's

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
slightly towards the driver and that's

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.149 
slightly towards the driver and that's
to<00:01:18.570> give<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.290> little<00:01:19.710> bit<00:01:19.920> more<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.130> a

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
more high tensile strength steel so it

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.230 
more high tensile strength steel so it
actually<00:04:44.560> was<00:04:44.919> able<00:04:45.010> to<00:04:45.280> improve<00:04:45.790> the<00:04:46.090> overall

reminiscent of the original GTI you're
also<00:05:28.720> going<00:05:28.900> to<00:05:28.960> find<00:05:29.140> a<00:05:29.200> couple<00:05:29.500> other<00:05:29.650> little

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
also going to find a couple other little

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.370 
also going to find a couple other little
homage<00:05:30.419> throwbacks<00:05:31.419> to<00:05:31.660> the<00:05:31.840> original<00:05:32.080> GTI

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
homage throwbacks to the original GTI

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.469 
homage throwbacks to the original GTI
like<00:05:32.740> the<00:05:32.950> golf<00:05:33.280> ball<00:05:33.490> shifter<00:05:33.880> on<00:05:34.090> the<00:05:34.270> stick

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 
like the golf ball shifter on the stick

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:40.730 
like the golf ball shifter on the stick
shift<00:05:34.660> models<00:05:35.050> and<00:05:35.320> the<00:05:36.270> inter<00:05:39.000> galata<00:05:40.000> there

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
shift models and the inter galata there

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.440 
shift models and the inter galata there
so<00:05:41.740> underneath<00:05:42.220> the<00:05:42.460> hood<00:05:42.640> of<00:05:42.880> the<00:05:42.970> new<00:05:43.090> GTI

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:43.450 
so underneath the hood of the new GTI

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.140 
so underneath the hood of the new GTI
they<00:05:44.050> are<00:05:44.380> sticking<00:05:44.979> with<00:05:45.130> the<00:05:45.250> 2-liter<00:05:45.640> turbo

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
they are sticking with the 2-liter turbo

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.190 
they are sticking with the 2-liter turbo
engine<00:05:46.479> that<00:05:46.630> you<00:05:46.720> had<00:05:46.870> in<00:05:46.990> previous

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:47.200 
engine that you had in previous

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.159 
engine that you had in previous
generations<00:05:47.790> however<00:05:48.790> it<00:05:49.000> has<00:05:49.330> been<00:05:49.660> tuned<00:05:49.990> in

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:50.169 
generations however it has been tuned in

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:52.020 
generations however it has been tuned in
partnership<00:05:50.620> with<00:05:50.650> Audi<00:05:51.010> so<00:05:51.610> it<00:05:51.700> actually<00:05:51.820> is

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.030 
partnership with Audi so it actually is

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.550 
partnership with Audi so it actually is
a<00:05:52.060> different<00:05:52.360> model<00:05:52.510> engine<00:05:53.020> and<00:05:53.290> that's

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
a different model engine and that's

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.930 
a different model engine and that's
going<00:05:53.740> to<00:05:53.800> mean<00:05:53.860> it<00:05:54.010> produces<00:05:54.400> much<00:05:54.640> more

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
going to mean it produces much more

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.390 
going to mean it produces much more
torque<00:05:55.300> and<00:05:55.479> about<00:05:55.690> 10<00:05:55.900> extra<00:05:56.080> horsepower<00:05:56.440> now

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
torque and about 10 extra horsepower now

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.620 
torque and about 10 extra horsepower now
you<00:05:57.460> can<00:05:57.700> also<00:05:57.910> get<00:05:58.150> what's<00:05:58.360> called<00:05:58.510> a

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
you can also get what's called a

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.210 
you can also get what's called a
performance<00:05:59.200> package<00:05:59.650> which<00:05:59.890> will<00:06:00.010> give<00:06:00.100> you

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220 
performance package which will give you

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.650 
performance package which will give you
a<00:06:00.280> couple<00:06:00.490> other<00:06:00.729> goodies<00:06:01.000> that'll<00:06:01.570> be

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:01.660 
a couple other goodies that'll be

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:02.850 
a couple other goodies that'll be
released<00:06:01.930> a<00:06:02.050> little<00:06:02.229> bit<00:06:02.320> later<00:06:02.500> on<00:06:02.680> in<00:06:02.800> the

released a little bit later on in the

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.400 
released a little bit later on in the
year<00:06:02.890> and<00:06:03.660> other<00:06:04.660> than<00:06:04.750> that<00:06:04.900> though<00:06:05.169> it's

year and other than that though it's

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.550 
year and other than that though it's
going<00:06:05.530> to<00:06:05.590> be<00:06:05.680> pretty<00:06:05.919> much<00:06:06.100> the<00:06:06.280> same<00:06:06.580> the

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
going to be pretty much the same the

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.260 
going to be pretty much the same the
front<00:06:08.560> engine<00:06:08.950> and<00:06:09.280> front-wheel<00:06:10.000> drive

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.660 
front engine and front-wheel drive
layout<00:06:10.660> is<00:06:11.080> typical<00:06:11.530> of<00:06:11.650> all<00:06:11.800> the<00:06:11.919> hot<00:06:12.070> hatch

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:12.670 
layout is typical of all the hot hatch

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:14.880 
layout is typical of all the hot hatch
models<00:06:13.450> and<00:06:13.690> you'll<00:06:14.110> be<00:06:14.260> able<00:06:14.350> to<00:06:14.560> get<00:06:14.710> that

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:14.890 
models and you'll be able to get that

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:16.950 
models and you'll be able to get that
with<00:06:15.070> either<00:06:15.280> a<00:06:15.400> 6-speed<00:06:16.030> manual<00:06:16.060> or<00:06:16.660> a

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 
6-speed DSG automatic so that's going to

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.120 
6-speed DSG automatic so that's going to
give<00:06:19.960> you<00:06:20.020> the<00:06:20.080> option<00:06:20.290> of<00:06:20.560> the<00:06:20.830> paddle

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.130 
give you the option of the paddle

the<00:06:30.460> new<00:06:30.580> GTI<00:06:31.110> it's<00:06:32.110> evident<00:06:32.950> that<00:06:33.100> the

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:33.670 
the new GTI it's evident that the

the new GTI it's evident that the
improvements<00:06:34.150> that<00:06:34.210> I've<00:06:34.300> been<00:06:34.390> made<00:06:34.510> to<00:06:34.660> the

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:34.690 
improvements that I've been made to the

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.380 
improvements that I've been made to the
car<00:06:34.990> are<00:06:35.140> significant<00:06:35.800> it<00:06:36.130> is<00:06:36.460> much<00:06:37.180> lighter

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:37.390 
car are significant it is much lighter

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:38.730 
car are significant it is much lighter
weight<00:06:37.630> and<00:06:37.870> the<00:06:37.960> footprint<00:06:38.320> really<00:06:38.500> feels

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:38.740 
weight and the footprint really feels

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.410 
weight and the footprint really feels
that<00:06:38.920> when<00:06:39.190> you<00:06:39.250> throw<00:06:39.490> it<00:06:39.580> in<00:06:39.640> the<00:06:39.730> corner<00:06:39.970> the

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:40.420 
that when you throw it in the corner the

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.900 
that when you throw it in the corner the
new<00:06:40.570> ESC<00:06:41.050> system<00:06:41.560> really<00:06:42.340> knows<00:06:42.460> what<00:06:42.640> to<00:06:42.760> do

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:42.910 
new ESC system really knows what to do

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:44.280 
new ESC system really knows what to do
and<00:06:43.330> you<00:06:43.480> can<00:06:43.600> tell<00:06:43.750> that's<00:06:43.930> a<00:06:43.990> little<00:06:44.200> bit

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:44.290 
and you can tell that's a little bit

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:45.750 
and you can tell that's a little bit
lighter<00:06:44.440> weight<00:06:44.680> one<00:06:45.460> of<00:06:45.550> the<00:06:45.610> big

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:45.760 
lighter weight one of the big

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:46.800 
lighter weight one of the big
improvements<00:06:46.210> that<00:06:46.270> you're<00:06:46.390> going<00:06:46.480> to<00:06:46.570> feel

improvements that you're going to feel

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.380 
improvements that you're going to feel
is<00:06:47.050> the<00:06:47.710> addition<00:06:48.310> of<00:06:48.400> the<00:06:48.580> electro<00:06:49.090> power

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:49.390 
is the addition of the electro power

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:53.040 
is the addition of the electro power
steering<00:06:49.990> as<00:06:50.710> compared<00:06:51.310> to<00:06:51.370> the<00:06:52.050> hydraulic

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.050 
steering as compared to the hydraulic

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:54.540 
steering as compared to the hydraulic

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:57.070 
on all previous GT is and this is going

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:59.250 
on all previous GT is and this is going
to<00:06:57.130> give<00:06:57.310> the<00:06:57.490> car<00:06:57.760> a<00:06:58.030> much<00:06:58.540> more<00:06:58.720> responsive

00:06:59.250 --> 00:06:59.260 
to give the car a much more responsive

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.160 
few different steering modes that will

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.980 
few different steering modes that will
adjust<00:07:06.490> the<00:07:06.640> sensitivity<00:07:06.910> of<00:07:07.240> the<00:07:07.660> steering
