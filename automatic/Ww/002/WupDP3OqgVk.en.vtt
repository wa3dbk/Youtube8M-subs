now as i showed in the beginning there's
one<00:01:38.930> two<00:01:39.230> three<00:01:39.650> cones<00:01:39.980> at<00:01:40.430> the<00:01:40.670> front<00:01:41.000> and

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270

just<00:01:41.840> be<00:01:42.050> adjustable<00:01:42.650> strap<00:01:43.040> at<00:01:43.310> the<00:01:43.340> back<00:01:43.520> it

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
just be adjustable strap at the back it

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.050 
just be adjustable strap at the back it
doesn't<00:01:44.720> have<00:01:44.840> any<00:01:45.020> ear<00:01:45.350> tabs<00:01:45.800> though<00:01:46.159> so<00:01:46.640> if

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
doesn't have any ear tabs though so if

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.870 
doesn't have any ear tabs though so if
you're<00:01:48.020> not<00:01:48.200> gluing<00:01:48.560> this<00:01:48.950> down<00:01:49.310> which<00:01:49.670> I

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
you're not gluing this down which I

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.450 
you're not gluing this down which I
won't<00:01:50.180> because<00:01:50.659> I<00:01:50.780> don't<00:01:50.960> do<00:01:51.170> glue<00:01:51.500> you

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
won't because I don't do glue you

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.360 
won't because I don't do glue you
probably<00:01:52.760> be<00:01:53.030> best<00:01:53.300> to<00:01:53.510> just<00:01:53.690> pin<00:01:54.140> it<00:01:54.170> down<00:01:54.370> but

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
probably be best to just pin it down but

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.789 
probably be best to just pin it down but
with<00:01:55.550> me<00:01:55.760> I'm<00:01:56.030> not<00:01:56.210> too<00:01:56.479> fussed<00:01:56.870> about<00:01:57.290> that

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
I'll just slick my edges and just make

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.680 
I'll just slick my edges and just make

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.949 
very nice it's soft this is a good way
for<00:02:06.590> me<00:02:06.860> to<00:02:07.010> switch<00:02:07.340> between<00:02:07.520> my<00:02:07.970> you<00:02:08.030> parts<00:02:08.720> um

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
for me to switch between my you parts um

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.979 
for me to switch between my you parts um
I<00:02:09.860> will<00:02:10.580> be<00:02:10.789> able<00:02:10.909> to<00:02:11.060> curl<00:02:11.420> this<00:02:11.629> because<00:02:11.870> it

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
I will be able to curl this because it

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.890 
I will be able to curl this because it
is<00:02:12.019> a<00:02:12.140> hundred<00:02:12.590> percent<00:02:12.709> remy<00:02:13.400> human<00:02:13.730> hair<00:02:13.970> so

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
is a hundred percent remy human hair so

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.250 
is a hundred percent remy human hair so
that'll<00:02:15.349> be<00:02:15.500> fun<00:02:15.769> to<00:02:15.980> play<00:02:16.250> with<00:02:16.489> it<00:02:16.700> I<00:02:17.450> find

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
that'll be fun to play with it I find

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
that'll be fun to play with it I find
that<00:02:18.379> it<00:02:18.620> is<00:02:18.769> a<00:02:18.799> bit<00:02:19.159> thick<00:02:19.640> at<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.120> top<00:02:21.280> my

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
does it look

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.690 
does it look
bulky<00:02:25.200> at<00:02:25.319> the<00:02:25.440> top<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:25.800> he<00:02:25.890> said<00:02:26.130> no<00:02:26.310> it<00:02:26.489> looks

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
bulky at the top and he said no it looks

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.210 
bulky at the top and he said no it looks
fine<00:02:26.849> but<00:02:27.480> I<00:02:27.989> know<00:02:28.170> for<00:02:28.470> some<00:02:28.650> reason<00:02:28.680> I<00:02:29.190> just

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
fine but I know for some reason I just

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.490 
fine but I know for some reason I just
find<00:02:29.670> it<00:02:29.819> to<00:02:30.060> be<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.239> lot<00:02:30.480> thicker<00:02:30.810> than<00:02:31.200> the

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
find it to be a lot thicker than the

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.630 
find it to be a lot thicker than the
rest<00:02:32.069> of<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.370> hair<00:02:32.610> but<00:02:33.030> I<00:02:33.270> mean<00:02:34.430> maybe<00:02:35.430> it's

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
rest of the hair but I mean maybe it's

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.540 
rest of the hair but I mean maybe it's
just<00:02:35.730> me<00:02:36.410> so<00:02:37.410> what<00:02:37.709> I'm<00:02:37.830> going<00:02:38.010> to<00:02:38.069> do<00:02:38.280> with

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
just me so what I'm going to do with

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.820 
just me so what I'm going to do with
this<00:02:38.700> one<00:02:39.030> is<00:02:39.239> I'm<00:02:39.720> not<00:02:40.050> sure<00:02:40.410> whether<00:02:40.680> I

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
this one is I'm not sure whether I

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.520 
this one is I'm not sure whether I
should<00:02:40.980> cut<00:02:41.430> some<00:02:41.760> layers<00:02:42.060> into<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:43.110> front<00:02:43.410> i

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
should cut some layers into the front i

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.040

and I was getting over the tangling like
this<00:03:33.030> and<00:03:33.239> very<00:03:33.299> care<00:03:33.870> so<00:03:34.230> it's<00:03:35.130> nice<00:03:35.489> it's<00:03:35.760> a

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910

so<00:03:39.150> best<00:03:39.390> lace<00:03:39.630> wigs<00:03:40.019> the<00:03:40.350> price<00:03:40.620> i<00:03:40.890> think<00:03:41.280> was

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
so best lace wigs the price i think was

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.640 
so best lace wigs the price i think was
reasonable<00:03:42.180> i<00:03:42.329> went<00:03:43.019> on<00:03:43.109> a<00:03:43.140> couple<00:03:43.560> of

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
reasonable i went on a couple of

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.130 
reasonable i went on a couple of
websites<00:03:43.890> and<00:03:44.489> as<00:03:45.000> you<00:03:45.180> all<00:03:45.359> know<00:03:45.390> less<00:03:45.840> weeks

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
websites and as you all know less weeks

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.920 
websites and as you all know less weeks
can<00:03:46.410> be<00:03:46.590> quite<00:03:47.069> expensive<00:03:47.120> so<00:03:48.120> i<00:03:48.569> thought<00:03:48.750> this

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
can be quite expensive so i thought this

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.840 
can be quite expensive so i thought this
was<00:03:49.109> a<00:03:49.140> good<00:03:49.380> one<00:03:49.590> for<00:03:49.799> me<00:03:49.950> to<00:03:50.100> start<00:03:50.430> with<00:03:50.670> just

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
was a good one for me to start with just

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.300 
was a good one for me to start with just
so<00:03:51.030> i<00:03:51.090> can<00:03:51.150> get<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:51.630> feel<00:03:51.989> of<00:03:52.019> it<00:03:52.380> see<00:03:53.040> if<00:03:53.100> I

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
so i can get the feel of it see if I

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.160 
so i can get the feel of it see if I
like<00:03:53.340> it<00:03:53.609> and<00:03:53.970> there<00:03:54.150> may<00:03:54.359> be<00:03:54.389> later<00:03:54.810> on<00:03:54.989> in

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
like it and there may be later on in

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.349 
like it and there may be later on in
testing<00:03:55.620> something<00:03:55.950> maybe<00:03:56.790> a<00:03:56.940> little<00:03:57.090> bit

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
testing something maybe a little bit

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:59.240 
testing something maybe a little bit
more<00:03:57.540> expensive<00:03:57.810> but<00:03:58.079> this<00:03:58.500> is<00:03:58.680> definitely<00:03:58.950> a

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
more expensive but this is definitely a

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.610 
more expensive but this is definitely a
good<00:03:59.519> first<00:04:00.209> week<00:04:00.359> for<00:04:00.750> me<00:04:00.870> like<00:04:01.109> I<00:04:01.290> said<00:04:01.470> it<00:04:01.590> is
