00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.250 
when I hit feel I have enough material
there<00:02:57.569> I'll<00:02:58.470> take<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:58.920> index<00:02:59.280> itself<00:03:00.260> I'll

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
there I'll take the index itself I'll

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.080 
there I'll take the index itself I'll
extrude<00:03:01.680> some<00:03:01.920> material<00:03:02.340> into<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.670> index

extrude some material into the index

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.069 
extrude some material into the index
around<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.569> margins<00:03:05.239> be<00:03:06.239> careful<00:03:06.629> so<00:03:06.810> I<00:03:06.870> don't

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
around the margins be careful so I don't

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:07.580 
around the margins be careful so I don't
get<00:03:07.200> any

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
get any

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.350

I<00:03:07.620> have<00:03:07.920> sufficient<00:03:08.400> materials<00:03:08.879> and<00:03:09.120> we<00:03:09.180> don't

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:21.140 
then I'll combine the two together place
it<00:03:20.730> down

me<00:05:32.810> it's<00:05:32.990> worked<00:05:33.230> really<00:05:33.320> well<00:05:33.590> I<00:05:34.010> use<00:05:34.850> it<00:05:35.030> at

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
me it's worked really well I use it at

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.080 
me it's worked really well I use it at
not<00:05:35.600> just<00:05:35.870> my<00:05:36.200> interiors<00:05:36.770> but<00:05:37.430> also<00:05:37.580> put<00:05:37.910> in<00:05:38.000> my

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
not just my interiors but also put in my
