00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
easy now one of the main reasons we all

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.910 
easy now one of the main reasons we all
die<00:00:39.149> in<00:00:39.180> black<00:00:39.600> ops<00:00:39.840> zombies<00:00:40.260> all<00:00:40.440> world<00:00:40.770> at

now<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:43.800> perk<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.280> obviously<00:00:44.640> going<00:00:44.850> to

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
now this perk is obviously going to

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.940 
now this perk is obviously going to
benefit<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.510> guns<00:00:45.750> from<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.020> random<00:00:46.530> box<00:00:46.739> the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
benefit the guns from the random box the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.369 
benefit the guns from the random box the
most<00:00:47.360> because<00:00:48.360> if<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.600> buy<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.780> gun<00:00:49.079> off<00:00:49.230> the

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
most because if you buy a gun off the

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.170 
most because if you buy a gun off the
wall<00:00:49.559> then<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:49.860> can<00:00:50.010> easily<00:00:50.370> go<00:00:50.789> back<00:00:50.820> to

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
wall then you can easily go back to

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.549 
wall then you can easily go back to
where<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.480> brought<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.020> refill<00:00:52.410> your

ammo even when you have a gun Parker
punched<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.230> just<00:00:55.500> means<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.010> ammo<00:00:56.219> is

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
punched it just means that the ammo is

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.700 
punched it just means that the ammo is
going<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.640> cost<00:00:56.820> more<00:00:57.210> Plus<00:00:58.109> this<00:00:58.289> perk<00:00:58.559> is

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
you're in the middle of a zombies round

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.870 
you're in the middle of a zombies round
or<00:01:10.380> you've<00:01:10.560> just<00:01:10.799> ended<00:01:11.189> one<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:11.640> don't

or you've just ended one and you don't

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.280 
or you've just ended one and you don't

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
want to get rid of it but you've got no

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.980 
want to get rid of it but you've got no
ammo<00:01:13.920> at<00:01:14.100> all<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.580> if<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.360> go<00:01:15.479> on<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.659> random

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
ammo at all and if you go on the random

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.240 
ammo at all and if you go on the random
box<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.409> change<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.860> might<00:01:17.009> get

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
box and change it you might get

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.130 
box and change it you might get
something<00:01:17.520> really<00:01:17.729> crappy<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:18.420> this<00:01:18.600> book<00:01:18.900> is

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
something really crappy so this book is

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.280 
something really crappy so this book is
going<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.590> really<00:01:19.890> help<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.369> them<00:01:20.520> situations

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
going to really help in them situations

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.690 
going to really help in them situations
so<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.320> think<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.710> this<00:01:23.009> perk<00:01:23.310> would<00:01:23.549> be

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
so I think that this perk would be

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.420 
so I think that this perk would be
really<00:01:24.000> great<00:01:24.570> but<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.470> might<00:01:25.710> make<00:01:25.950> zombies<00:01:26.400> a

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
really great but it might make zombies a

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.300 
really great but it might make zombies a
little<00:01:26.820> bit<00:01:27.000> too<00:01:27.180> easy<00:01:27.409> now<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.470> next<00:01:28.590> perk<00:01:29.100> is

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
little bit too easy now the next perk is

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.490 
little bit too easy now the next perk is
simply<00:01:29.820> called<00:01:30.090> spring<00:01:30.630> wings<00:01:30.900> now<00:01:31.470> I

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
simply called spring wings now I

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.050 
simply called spring wings now I
actually<00:01:31.650> couldn't<00:01:32.100> think<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.520> better<00:01:32.549> name

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
actually couldn't think of a better name

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.580 
actually couldn't think of a better name
for<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.360> but<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.570> thought<00:01:33.780> spring<00:01:34.200> wings<00:01:34.380> was

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
for it but I thought spring wings was

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.950 
for it but I thought spring wings was
alright<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.700> basically<00:01:35.939> all<00:01:36.270> this<00:01:36.509> perk<00:01:36.780> will

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
alright and basically all this perk will

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.289 
alright and basically all this perk will
do<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.320> make<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.500> jump<00:01:37.920> higher<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.369> dolphin

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
do is make you jump higher and dolphin

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.719 
do is make you jump higher and dolphin
dive<00:01:39.540> for<00:01:39.810> longer<00:01:40.259> so<00:01:41.070> this<00:01:41.220> parrot<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.579> going

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
dive for longer so this parrot is going

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.370 
dive for longer so this parrot is going
to<00:01:41.790> be<00:01:41.880> most<00:01:42.119> useful<00:01:42.270> when<00:01:42.780> you're<00:01:42.869> trapped<00:01:43.200> up

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
to be most useful when you're trapped up

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.560 
to be most useful when you're trapped up
them<00:01:43.560> corners<00:01:44.040> maybe<00:01:44.549> it's<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.850> cruel<00:01:45.119> or<00:01:45.149> just

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
them corners maybe it's a cruel or just

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.569 
them corners maybe it's a cruel or just
the<00:01:45.659> normal<00:01:46.049> zombie<00:01:46.409> if<00:01:46.500> it's<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.740> crawler<00:01:47.009> then

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
the normal zombie if it's a crawler then

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:48.950 
the normal zombie if it's a crawler then
you're<00:01:47.820> going<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.000> be<00:01:48.119> able<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.450> like<00:01:48.540> jump

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.600 
you're going to be able to like jump
over<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.560> just<00:01:49.680> get<00:01:49.890> out<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.159> way<00:01:50.310> instead

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.710 
of being killed and maybe if it's a herd
of<00:01:52.829> zombies<00:01:53.009> maybe<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.579> can<00:01:53.759> like<00:01:53.909> dolphin

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720

little<00:01:56.430> situation<00:01:57.110> I'm<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.380> final<00:01:58.829> pick<00:01:59.040> which

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.130 
little situation I'm a final pick which
I<00:01:59.460> think<00:01:59.729> as<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.880> really<00:02:00.299> clever<00:02:00.600> name<00:02:00.960> is

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
I think as a really clever name is

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.679 
I think as a really clever name is
called<00:02:01.649> Ram<00:02:01.950> soda<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:03.030> this<00:02:03.180> pier<00:02:03.420> it's<00:02:03.509> going

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
called Ram soda so this pier it's going

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.660 
called Ram soda so this pier it's going
to<00:02:03.750> give<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.140> ability<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.649> nudge<00:02:05.070> or<00:02:05.280> Ram

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
to give you the ability to nudge or Ram

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.449 
to give you the ability to nudge or Ram

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
zombies out of the way so again is a bit

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.279 
zombies out of the way so again is a bit

that little situation up a corner you're
going<00:02:12.750> to<00:02:12.810> be<00:02:12.900> able<00:02:12.959> to<00:02:13.140> just

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
it's not too overpowered and at the same

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.699 
it's not too overpowered and at the same
time<00:02:33.510> when<00:02:33.959> you're<00:02:34.080> ramming<00:02:34.380> them<00:02:34.500> out<00:02:34.590> the

time when you're ramming them out the

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.980 
time when you're ramming them out the
way<00:02:34.860> it<00:02:35.100> won't<00:02:35.280> kill<00:02:35.580> them<00:02:35.820> just<00:02:36.060> just<00:02:36.720> move

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
way it won't kill them just just move

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.860 
way it won't kill them just just move
them<00:02:37.290> a<00:02:37.440> bit<00:02:37.850> so<00:02:38.850> that's<00:02:39.060> it<00:02:39.270> for<00:02:39.300> this<00:02:39.540> part
