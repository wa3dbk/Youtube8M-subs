00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
it's not organic gardening the

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.960 
it's not organic gardening the
difference<00:02:55.319> is<00:02:55.470> that<00:02:55.500> organic<00:02:56.040> gardening<00:02:56.730> is

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
difference is that organic gardening is

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.199 
difference is that organic gardening is
essentially<00:02:57.600> a<00:02:57.630> set<00:02:57.810> of<00:02:57.900> techniques

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
essentially a set of techniques

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.809 
essentially a set of techniques
permaculture<00:03:00.209> is<00:03:00.389> a<00:03:00.420> design<00:03:00.930> approach<00:03:01.819> so

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
permaculture is a design approach so

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.800 
permaculture is a design approach so
it's<00:03:03.630> about<00:03:04.079> designing<00:03:05.299> the<00:03:06.299> way<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:06.540> live

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
it's about designing the way you live

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.720 
it's about designing the way you live
the<00:03:06.840> way<00:03:07.200> you<00:03:07.319> use<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:07.829> land<00:03:08.040> for<00:03:08.280> it<00:03:08.489> to<00:03:08.579> be

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
the way you use the land for it to be

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.699 
the way you use the land for it to be
more<00:03:08.910> sustainable<00:03:09.200> so<00:03:10.200> will<00:03:10.319> I<00:03:10.349> be<00:03:10.530> right<00:03:10.680> in

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
more sustainable so will I be right in

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.259 
more sustainable so will I be right in
thinking<00:03:10.859> that<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.340> word<00:03:11.489> permaculture<00:03:12.180> is

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
thinking that the word permaculture is

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.089 
thinking that the word permaculture is
made<00:03:12.420> from<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.989> two<00:03:13.170> words<00:03:13.380> permanence<00:03:14.010> and

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
made from the two words permanence and

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.249 
made from the two words permanence and
culture<00:03:14.690> suggesting<00:03:15.690> that<00:03:15.780> we<00:03:15.900> have<00:03:16.049> to

00:03:16.249 --> 00:03:16.259 
culture suggesting that we have to

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:17.449 
culture suggesting that we have to
change<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:16.799> way<00:03:16.919> that<00:03:17.040> we're<00:03:17.190> living<00:03:17.340> now

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
change the way that we're living now

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.039 
change the way that we're living now
because<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:17.940> society<00:03:18.239> in<00:03:18.509> the<00:03:18.600> culture<00:03:18.959> in

because the society in the culture in

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:20.569 
because the society in the culture in
which<00:03:19.169> we're<00:03:19.350> participating<00:03:20.100> kind<00:03:20.310> of<00:03:20.400> looks

which we're participating kind of looks

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.009 
which we're participating kind of looks
like<00:03:20.669> it<00:03:20.880> has<00:03:20.970> a

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
like it has a

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.110 
like it has a
lifespan<00:03:22.739> is<00:03:23.280> going<00:03:23.550> to<00:03:23.610> implode<00:03:23.849> on<00:03:24.060> itself

it's<00:03:24.599> not<00:03:24.780> really<00:03:25.050> sustainable

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
it's not really sustainable

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.750 
it's not really sustainable
yes<00:03:26.010> permaculture<00:03:27.409> does<00:03:28.409> include<00:03:28.920> that<00:03:29.159> it

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
yes permaculture does include that it

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.500 
yes permaculture does include that it
also<00:03:30.269> respects<00:03:30.959> the<00:03:31.349> fact<00:03:31.620> that<00:03:32.510> culture

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
also respects the fact that culture

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.259 
also respects the fact that culture
culturally<00:03:34.409> many<00:03:35.040> traditional<00:03:35.519> peoples<00:03:35.970> have

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
culturally many traditional peoples have

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.570 
culturally many traditional peoples have
an<00:03:36.569> awful<00:03:36.930> lot<00:03:37.049> of<00:03:37.129> ancient<00:03:38.129> knowledge<00:03:38.250> and

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
an awful lot of ancient knowledge and

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.820 
an awful lot of ancient knowledge and
wisdom<00:03:38.790> from<00:03:39.720> living<00:03:40.019> very<00:03:40.200> close<00:03:40.410> to<00:03:40.709> the

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
wisdom from living very close to the

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.740 
wisdom from living very close to the
land<00:03:41.010> and<00:03:41.220> close<00:03:41.400> to<00:03:41.580> nature<00:03:42.030> for<00:03:42.209> a<00:03:42.239> long<00:03:42.450> time

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
land and close to nature for a long time

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.839 
land and close to nature for a long time
so<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:43.650> permanent<00:03:44.160> culture<00:03:44.370> comes<00:03:44.760> from

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
so the permanent culture comes from

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:48.710 
so the permanent culture comes from
bringing<00:03:45.810> that<00:03:46.110> into<00:03:46.799> our<00:03:47.129> designs<00:03:47.519> and<00:03:48.030> then

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
bringing that into our designs and then

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.479 
bringing that into our designs and then
part<00:03:49.110> of<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.319> permanent<00:03:49.620> is<00:03:50.010> an

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
part of the permanent is an

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.600 
part of the permanent is an
understanding<00:03:51.269> that<00:03:51.299> although<00:03:51.709> we<00:03:52.709> currently

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
understanding that although we currently

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.569 
understanding that although we currently
rely<00:03:53.849> on<00:03:53.879> very<00:03:54.329> many<00:03:54.629> annual<00:03:55.200> crops<00:03:55.579> that

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
rely on very many annual crops that

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.130 
rely on very many annual crops that
actually<00:03:57.360> if<00:03:57.540> we're<00:03:57.720> going<00:03:57.840> to<00:03:57.930> be<00:03:57.989> more

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
actually if we're going to be more

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.750 
actually if we're going to be more
sustainable<00:03:58.349> we<00:03:58.920> need<00:03:59.069> to<00:03:59.190> be<00:03:59.280> thinking<00:03:59.459> about

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
sustainable we need to be thinking about

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.910 
sustainable we need to be thinking about
more<00:04:00.090> perennial<00:04:00.480> systems<00:04:01.170> more

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
more perennial systems more

annual crops require a lot of energy to

annual crops require a lot of energy to
