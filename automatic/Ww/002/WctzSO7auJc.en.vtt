00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.689 
roll so to recap the first 2 strokes of
the<00:00:27.660> paradiddle<00:00:28.140> make<00:00:29.010> sure<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.400> you<00:00:29.519> know

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
the paradiddle make sure that you know

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.759 
the paradiddle make sure that you know
that<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:30.150> first<00:00:30.390> stroke<00:00:30.689> is<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.960> Down<00:00:31.380> stroke

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
that the first stroke is a Down stroke

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.040 
that the first stroke is a Down stroke
followed<00:00:32.579> by<00:00:32.700> an<00:00:32.850> up<00:00:33.030> stroke<00:00:33.329> on<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.630> opposite

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
followed by an up stroke on the opposite

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.229 
followed by an up stroke on the opposite
hand<00:00:34.380> if<00:00:34.590> you've<00:00:35.100> worked<00:00:35.250> out<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.730> technique

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
hand if you've worked out that technique

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.240 
hand if you've worked out that technique
from<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.660> previous<00:00:37.020> lesson<00:00:37.230> this<00:00:37.920> should<00:00:38.160> be

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
from the previous lesson this should be

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.750 
from the previous lesson this should be
very<00:00:38.460> easy<00:00:38.520> all<00:00:39.180> we<00:00:39.239> do<00:00:39.660> down<00:00:40.230> up<00:00:40.649> is<00:00:41.129> add<00:00:41.579> the

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
very easy all we do down up is add the

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.600 
very easy all we do down up is add the
two<00:00:41.940> taps<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:43.200> finish<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.710> paradiddle<00:00:44.129> so

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
two taps that finish the paradiddle so

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.490 
two taps that finish the paradiddle so
down<00:00:45.480> up<00:00:45.899> tap<00:00:46.829> step<00:00:47.510> then<00:00:48.510> look<00:00:49.050> at<00:00:49.170> your<00:00:49.320> hands

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
down up tap step then look at your hands

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.709 
down up tap step then look at your hands
make<00:00:49.800> sure<00:00:49.829> everything<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.460> set<00:00:50.640> do<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.300> again

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
make sure everything is set do it again

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.869 
make sure everything is set do it again
but<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.110> time<00:00:52.289> on<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.710> opposite<00:00:53.070> hand<00:00:53.250> down

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
but this time on the opposite hand down

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.029 
but this time on the opposite hand down
up<00:00:54.360> tap<00:00:55.140> tap

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
up tap tap

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.439 
up tap tap
then<00:00:56.640> we<00:00:56.760> can<00:00:56.910> go<00:00:57.030> back<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.449> forth<00:00:57.829> up<00:00:58.829> tap

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
then we can go back and forth up tap

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:08.300 
then we can go back and forth up tap
down<00:01:00.449> up<00:01:01.020> up<00:01:05.689> tap<00:01:06.689> at<00:01:06.960> this<00:01:07.680> point<00:01:07.979> what<00:01:08.159> you

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
down up up tap at this point what you

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.730 
down up up tap at this point what you
should<00:01:08.520> do<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:09.030> practice<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:10.260> single

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
should do is practice the single

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.980 
should do is practice the single
paradiddle<00:01:11.070> at<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.400> very<00:01:11.790> slow<00:01:12.119> tempo<00:01:12.330> set<00:01:12.869> the

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
paradiddle at a very slow tempo set the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.810 
paradiddle at a very slow tempo set the
metronome<00:01:13.140> on<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.650> hundred<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.280> twenty<00:01:14.640> and

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
metronome on a hundred and twenty and

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.499 
metronome on a hundred and twenty and
just<00:01:15.240> practice<00:01:19.670> making<00:01:20.670> sure<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:21.030> every<00:01:21.360> one

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
just practice making sure that every one

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.570 
just practice making sure that every one
of<00:01:21.570> those<00:01:21.780> strokes<00:01:22.140> especially<00:01:22.770> inside<00:01:23.340> the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
of those strokes especially inside the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.179 
of those strokes especially inside the
accent<00:01:24.090> sound<00:01:24.450> exactly<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.140> same<00:01:25.259> your<00:01:25.950> tap

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
accent sound exactly the same your tap

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.219 
accent sound exactly the same your tap
should<00:01:26.430> be<00:01:26.520> made<00:01:26.700> with<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.939> good<00:01:27.240> double<00:01:28.020> wrist

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
should be made with a good double wrist

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.960 
should be made with a good double wrist
motion<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.829> not<00:01:28.950> just<00:01:29.220> by<00:01:29.340> dropping<00:01:29.610> the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
motion and not just by dropping the

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.050 
motion and not just by dropping the
stick<00:01:30.210> move<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.990> metronome<00:01:31.439> up<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.770> 140<00:01:32.610> then

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
stick move the metronome up to 140 then

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.749 
stick move the metronome up to 140 then
move<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.390> metronome<00:01:33.840> up<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.110> 160<00:01:34.950> by<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.549> time

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
move the metronome up to 160 by the time

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.289 
move the metronome up to 160 by the time
you<00:01:35.909> get<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:37.340> 160<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.790> should<00:01:39.000> be<00:01:39.090> able<00:01:39.180> to

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
you get to 160 you should be able to

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.840 
you get to 160 you should be able to
play<00:01:39.570> this<00:01:39.840> at<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.290> same<00:01:40.500> tempo<00:01:40.979> as<00:01:41.220> all<00:01:41.670> of

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
play this at the same tempo as all of

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:55.820 
play this at the same tempo as all of
your<00:01:42.000> other<00:01:42.119> rudiments

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.580 

okay<00:01:56.580> so<00:01:57.150> practice<00:01:57.780> on<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.230> single

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
okay so practice on the single

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.380 
okay so practice on the single
paradiddle<00:01:58.860> every<00:01:59.310> single<00:01:59.670> day<00:01:59.820> paying

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
paradiddle every single day paying

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.090 
paradiddle every single day paying
attention<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.140> making<00:02:01.470> sure<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.680> those

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
attention to making sure that those

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.520 
attention to making sure that those
inner<00:02:02.460> beats<00:02:02.940> are<00:02:03.210> all<00:02:03.540> right<00:02:03.990> there<00:02:04.290> at<00:02:04.500> that

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
inner beats are all right there at that

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.440 
inner beats are all right there at that
three<00:02:04.980> to<00:02:05.130> four<00:02:05.310> inch<00:02:05.520> height<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.030> you're

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
three to four inch height and you're

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.450 
three to four inch height and you're
having<00:02:06.720> a<00:02:06.810> good<00:02:06.990> solid<00:02:07.290> height<00:02:07.710> for<00:02:07.980> your<00:02:08.070> for

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
having a good solid height for your for

having a good solid height for your for
your<00:02:08.580> accent<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.720> ninth<00:02:09.930> stroke<00:02:10.140> roll<00:02:10.350> is

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
your accent the ninth stroke roll is

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.410 
your accent the ninth stroke roll is
essentially<00:02:11.040> the<00:02:11.130> same<00:02:11.400> techniques<00:02:12.000> that<00:02:12.300> you

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
essentially the same techniques that you

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.510 
essentially the same techniques that you
apply<00:02:12.750> to<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:13.080> five<00:02:13.350> stroke<00:02:13.650> roll<00:02:13.740> with<00:02:14.100> just

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
apply to the five stroke roll with just

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.760 
apply to the five stroke roll with just
different<00:02:14.940> numbers<00:02:15.300> of<00:02:15.480> strokes<00:02:15.780> so<00:02:16.290> let<00:02:16.710> me

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
different numbers of strokes so let me

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.130 
different numbers of strokes so let me
recap<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.340> five<00:02:17.550> stroke<00:02:17.820> roll<00:02:17.970> we're<00:02:18.570> playing

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
recap the five stroke roll we're playing

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
recap the five stroke roll we're playing
our<00:02:19.320> doubles<00:02:19.830> at<00:02:20.070> about<00:02:20.520> a<00:02:20.550> half<00:02:20.820> height

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
our doubles at about a half height

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.460 
our doubles at about a half height
finishing<00:02:23.160> off<00:02:23.310> with<00:02:23.340> a<00:02:23.850> full<00:02:24.330> stroke<00:02:25.080> on<00:02:25.320> the

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
finishing off with a full stroke on the

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.110 
finishing off with a full stroke on the
accent<00:02:25.890> a<00:02:26.040> fold<00:02:26.310> down<00:02:26.400> stroke<00:02:26.880> so

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
accent a fold down stroke so

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.690

to<00:02:43.860> think<00:02:44.070> of<00:02:44.190> it<00:02:44.280> as<00:02:44.400> just<00:02:44.610> four<00:02:44.880> doubles<00:02:45.300> one

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
to think of it as just four doubles one

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.460 
to think of it as just four doubles one
two<00:02:46.290> three<00:02:46.860> four<00:02:47.340> exit<00:02:48.150> rest<00:02:48.990> and<00:02:49.260> then<00:02:49.350> the

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
two three four exit rest and then the

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.650 
two three four exit rest and then the
same<00:02:49.680> thing<00:02:49.920> on<00:02:50.070> the<00:02:50.160> opposite<00:02:50.490> hand<00:02:50.700> one<00:02:51.209> two

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
same thing on the opposite hand one two

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.920 
same thing on the opposite hand one two
three<00:02:52.230> four<00:02:52.880> so<00:02:53.880> once<00:02:54.240> you've<00:02:54.390> gotten<00:02:54.570> that<00:02:54.750> to

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
three four so once you've gotten that to

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.020 
three four so once you've gotten that to
160<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:55.860> can<00:02:56.040> add<00:02:56.190> that<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.430> your<00:02:56.550> daily

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.640 
160 you can add that to your daily
practice<00:02:57.270> routine<00:02:57.870> here's<00:02:58.170> what<00:02:58.350> it<00:02:58.470> looked

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
practice routine here's what it looked

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:11.420 
practice routine here's what it looked
like<00:03:01.010> resk<00:03:04.010> best<00:03:07.010> best<00:03:09.830> so<00:03:10.830> you<00:03:10.860> can<00:03:11.100> see<00:03:11.280> how

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
like resk best best so you can see how

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.190 
like resk best best so you can see how
all<00:03:11.459> of<00:03:11.700> these<00:03:11.940> roll<00:03:12.239> rudiments<00:03:12.780> will<00:03:12.900> start

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
all of these roll rudiments will start

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.770 
all of these roll rudiments will start
being<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.860> same<00:03:14.160> as<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:15.150> other<00:03:15.330> ones<00:03:15.570> that

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780

being the same as the other ones that
you've<00:03:15.930> already<00:03:16.080> learned<00:03:16.230> so<00:03:16.530> if<00:03:16.920> you're

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
you've already learned so if you're

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.920 
you've already learned so if you're
practicing<00:03:17.700> your<00:03:17.910> double<00:03:18.239> stroke<00:03:18.450> roll<00:03:18.480> and

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
your five stroke roll this will be very

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.970 
your five stroke roll this will be very
very<00:03:21.060> simple<00:03:21.450> for<00:03:21.750> you<00:03:21.870> okay<00:03:22.320> if<00:03:22.530> your

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
very simple for you okay if your

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.350 
very simple for you okay if your
practice<00:03:23.130> time<00:03:23.550> starts<00:03:23.940> getting<00:03:24.239> a<00:03:24.330> little

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
practice time starts getting a little

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.660 
practice time starts getting a little
bit<00:03:24.720> hectic<00:03:25.019> or<00:03:25.470> you<00:03:25.680> don't<00:03:25.980> have<00:03:26.190> as<00:03:26.459> much

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
time as you'd like you could start

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.199 
time as you'd like you could start
