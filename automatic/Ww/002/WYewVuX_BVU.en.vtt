00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
do that because I'm pretty sure I can

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.090 
do that because I'm pretty sure I can
set<00:00:47.129> up<00:00:47.870> sasha<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.020> gonna<00:00:49.200> fire<00:00:49.469> blast<00:00:49.890> which

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
for the agility didn't I didn't think

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.260 
for the agility didn't I didn't think
she<00:00:54.449> would<00:00:54.539> taunt<00:00:54.840> because<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:56.489> guess<00:00:57.030> she<00:00:57.180> was

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
she would taunt because I guess she was

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.670 
she would taunt because I guess she was
afraid<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.809> would<00:00:57.930> just<00:00:58.020> kill<00:00:58.289> her<00:00:58.440> and

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
afraid that I would just kill her and

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.380

even<00:03:40.470> do<00:03:40.769> that<00:03:40.799> much<00:03:41.100> damage<00:03:41.510> in<00:03:42.510> fact<00:03:42.780> it

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
even do that much damage in fact it

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:43.940 
even do that much damage in fact it
looks<00:03:43.080> like<00:03:43.200> he<00:03:43.290> cuz<00:03:43.410> if<00:03:43.560> I<00:03:43.650> have<00:03:43.739> another

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
looks like he cuz if I have another

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.890 
looks like he cuz if I have another
three<00:03:44.310> sandstorm<00:03:44.880> hits<00:03:45.090> so<00:03:45.299> that<00:03:45.510> was<00:03:45.690> just

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
three sandstorm hits so that was just

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.920 
three sandstorm hits so that was just
rather<00:03:46.320> annoying<00:03:47.010> for<00:03:47.250> me<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:47.720> yeah<00:03:48.720> the

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
rather annoying for me and yeah the

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.259 
rather annoying for me and yeah the
Mayan<00:03:49.140> fern<00:03:49.320> that<00:03:49.470> goes<00:03:49.650> down<00:03:49.890> so<00:03:50.670> I<00:03:50.730> go<00:03:51.120> out

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
Mayan fern that goes down so I go out

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.110 
Mayan fern that goes down so I go out
into<00:03:51.470> my<00:03:52.470> Gyarados<00:03:52.950> hoping<00:03:53.459> that<00:03:53.640> this<00:03:53.910> thing

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
into my Gyarados hoping that this thing

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.509 
into my Gyarados hoping that this thing
is<00:03:54.360> modest<00:03:55.350> not<00:03:55.500> timid<00:03:55.950> because<00:03:56.070> Gyarados

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
is modest not timid because Gyarados

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.100 
is modest not timid because Gyarados
actually<00:03:56.760> has<00:03:56.850> one<00:03:57.060> more<00:03:57.269> base<00:03:57.480> speed<00:03:57.780> than

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
actually has one more base speed than

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.830 
actually has one more base speed than
Togekiss<00:03:58.620> and<00:03:58.860> this<00:03:59.370> is<00:03:59.489> a<00:03:59.519> max<00:03:59.880> speed<00:04:00.120> adamant

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
Togekiss and this is a max speed adamant

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.110 
Togekiss and this is a max speed adamant
Gyarados<00:04:01.560> and<00:04:01.830> thankfully<00:04:02.760> for<00:04:02.790> me

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
Gyarados and thankfully for me

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.470 
Gyarados and thankfully for me
she<00:04:03.720> said<00:04:03.959> her<00:04:04.080> Togekiss<00:04:04.500> was<00:04:04.799> modest<00:04:05.430> so<00:04:05.730> that

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
she said her Togekiss was modest so that

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.240 
she said her Togekiss was modest so that
means<00:04:06.720> my<00:04:06.900> Gyarados<00:04:07.290> is<00:04:07.440> able<00:04:07.680> to<00:04:07.739> take<00:04:07.980> it<00:04:08.100> out

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
means my Gyarados is able to take it out

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.270 
means my Gyarados is able to take it out
which<00:04:08.519> is<00:04:08.760> epic<00:04:09.269> and<00:04:09.769> yeah<00:04:10.769> that's<00:04:11.010> all<00:04:11.100> I<00:04:11.160> have

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
which is epic and yeah that's all I have

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.250 
which is epic and yeah that's all I have
to<00:04:11.400> say<00:04:11.430> so<00:04:12.269> she<00:04:12.390> goes<00:04:12.600> out<00:04:12.720> into<00:04:12.989> our<00:04:13.110> own

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
to say so she goes out into our own

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.819 
to say so she goes out into our own
Gyarados<00:04:13.860> and<00:04:14.160> I'm<00:04:15.090> pretty<00:04:15.570> sure<00:04:15.930> I<00:04:16.260> might<00:04:16.650> be

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
Gyarados and I'm pretty sure I might be

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.920 
Gyarados and I'm pretty sure I might be
faster<00:04:17.340> because<00:04:17.549> like<00:04:17.970> I<00:04:18.090> said<00:04:18.329> I'm<00:04:18.479> adding<00:04:18.810> at

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
faster because like I said I'm adding at

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.630 
faster because like I said I'm adding at
max<00:04:19.169> speed<00:04:19.440> most<00:04:19.799> carrados's<00:04:20.220> are<00:04:20.400> kind<00:04:20.579> of

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
max speed most carrados's are kind of

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.969 
max speed most carrados's are kind of
bulky<00:04:21.060> so<00:04:21.570> I<00:04:21.600> go<00:04:22.020> for<00:04:22.169> the<00:04:22.289> stone<00:04:22.530> edge<00:04:22.740> and

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
bulky so I go for the stone edge and

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.650 
bulky so I go for the stone edge and
that<00:04:23.070> is<00:04:23.220> super<00:04:23.520> effective<00:04:23.970> and<00:04:24.120> I<00:04:24.150> do<00:04:24.210> hit

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
that is super effective and I do hit

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.760 
that is super effective and I do hit
which<00:04:24.870> is<00:04:25.050> nice

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
which is nice

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.830 
which is nice
and<00:04:25.860> yeah<00:04:26.789> he<00:04:26.910> she<00:04:27.360> just<00:04:27.539> goes<00:04:27.660> with<00:04:27.810> the

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
and yeah he she just goes with the

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.839 
and yeah he she just goes with the
taught<00:04:28.139> so<00:04:28.500> she<00:04:29.069> thought<00:04:29.220> I<00:04:29.280> would<00:04:29.460> drag<00:04:29.669> and

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:29.849 
taught so she thought I would drag and

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:32.480 
taught so she thought I would drag and
dance<00:04:30.000> I<00:04:30.150> guess<00:04:30.389> and<00:04:31.039> for<00:04:32.039> some<00:04:32.190> reason<00:04:32.430> she

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
dance I guess and for some reason she

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:33.980 
dance I guess and for some reason she
thought<00:04:32.759> it<00:04:32.910> was<00:04:33.000> a<00:04:33.030> speed<00:04:33.330> tie<00:04:33.509> I<00:04:33.539> mean<00:04:33.810> maybe

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
thought it was a speed tie I mean maybe

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.510 
thought it was a speed tie I mean maybe
it<00:04:34.110> is<00:04:34.199> beat<00:04:34.470> I'm<00:04:34.650> not<00:04:34.889> sure<00:04:35.009> because<00:04:35.190> I<00:04:35.400> go

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
it is beat I'm not sure because I go

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.520 
it is beat I'm not sure because I go
first<00:04:35.759> this<00:04:35.970> turn<00:04:36.210> to<00:04:36.479> so<00:04:36.780> and<00:04:37.080> then<00:04:37.229> the<00:04:37.349> turn

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
first this turn to so and then the turn

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:38.869 
first this turn to so and then the turn
after<00:04:37.919> so<00:04:38.250> I<00:04:38.280> don't<00:04:38.550> know

00:04:38.869 --> 00:04:38.879 
after so I don't know

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:40.879 
after so I don't know
so<00:04:39.419> this<00:04:39.629> turn<00:04:39.840> I<00:04:39.960> go<00:04:40.110> for<00:04:40.259> the<00:04:40.349> waterfall

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:40.889 
so this turn I go for the waterfall

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:42.499 
so this turn I go for the waterfall
hoping<00:04:41.370> that<00:04:41.580> I<00:04:41.610> would<00:04:41.849> get<00:04:42.000> it<00:04:42.120> down<00:04:42.270> to<00:04:42.300> a

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:42.509 
hoping that I would get it down to a

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:45.230 
hoping that I would get it down to a
point<00:04:42.780> that<00:04:43.110> it<00:04:43.319> dies<00:04:43.979> to<00:04:44.340> the<00:04:44.460> sandstorm<00:04:45.180> I

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
point that it dies to the sandstorm I

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.219 
point that it dies to the sandstorm I
didn't<00:04:45.419> want<00:04:45.539> to<00:04:45.599> go<00:04:45.690> for<00:04:45.720> this<00:04:45.930> donut

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
didn't want to go for this donut

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:47.659 
didn't want to go for this donut
referring<00:04:46.500> to<00:04:46.590> miss<00:04:46.800> and<00:04:47.099> they<00:04:47.370> were<00:04:47.430> getting

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
referring to miss and they were getting

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:49.159 
referring to miss and they were getting
the<00:04:47.759> flinch<00:04:48.120> and<00:04:48.360> I<00:04:48.419> was<00:04:48.569> actually<00:04:48.720> wrong

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
the flinch and I was actually wrong

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:51.140 
the flinch and I was actually wrong
because<00:04:49.530> she<00:04:50.099> doesn't<00:04:50.460> die<00:04:50.580> so<00:04:50.879> that<00:04:50.909> was

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
because she doesn't die so that was

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.210 
because she doesn't die so that was
second<00:04:51.930> hacks<00:04:52.110> I<00:04:52.289> got<00:04:52.470> in<00:04:52.590> this<00:04:52.650> battle<00:04:53.009> and<00:04:53.099> I

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
second hacks I got in this battle and I

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.059 
second hacks I got in this battle and I
am<00:04:53.370> really<00:04:53.789> I<00:04:54.090> feel<00:04:54.479> bad<00:04:54.720> about<00:04:54.990> that<00:04:55.110> I<00:04:55.590> don't

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:56.069 
am really I feel bad about that I don't

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:57.649 
am really I feel bad about that I don't
know<00:04:56.250> what<00:04:56.430> move<00:04:56.639> she<00:04:56.819> was<00:04:56.909> going<00:04:57.120> to<00:04:57.210> do<00:04:57.360> but

00:04:57.649 --> 00:04:57.659 
know what move she was going to do but

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:59.870 
know what move she was going to do but
it<00:04:57.780> probably<00:04:57.900> would<00:04:58.139> have<00:04:58.199> hurt<00:04:58.409> and<00:04:58.819> yeah<00:04:59.819> I

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
it probably would have hurt and yeah I

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.279 
it probably would have hurt and yeah I
just<00:04:59.940> go<00:05:00.210> for<00:05:00.389> the<00:05:00.449> waterfall<00:05:00.870> and<00:05:01.139> that's

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:01.289 
just go for the waterfall and that's

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:04.550 
just go for the waterfall and that's
going<00:05:01.440> to<00:05:01.500> take<00:05:01.650> down<00:05:01.860> her<00:05:02.220> Gyarados<00:05:02.669> so<00:05:03.560> yeah

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
going to take down her Gyarados so yeah

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.749 
going to take down her Gyarados so yeah
there<00:05:04.949> you<00:05:05.069> have<00:05:05.250> it<00:05:05.430> and<00:05:06.650> yeah<00:05:07.650> so<00:05:08.009> I<00:05:08.220> had<00:05:08.520> a

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:08.759 
there you have it and yeah so I had a

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:10.399 
there you have it and yeah so I had a
hackster<00:05:09.210> twice<00:05:09.419> in<00:05:09.630> this<00:05:09.690> battle<00:05:10.020> I'm<00:05:10.199> sure

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:10.409 
hackster twice in this battle I'm sure

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:12.050 
hackster twice in this battle I'm sure
it<00:05:10.500> would<00:05:10.590> have<00:05:10.680> been<00:05:10.770> a<00:05:10.800> lot<00:05:11.009> closer<00:05:11.340> if<00:05:11.699> I

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
it would have been a lot closer if I

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.689 
it would have been a lot closer if I
hadn't<00:05:12.479> done<00:05:12.810> that<00:05:12.840> but<00:05:13.349> whatever<00:05:13.830> so<00:05:14.220> she

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:14.699 
hadn't done that but whatever so she

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:16.820 
hadn't done that but whatever so she
goes<00:05:14.940> out<00:05:15.120> into<00:05:15.300> Tyranitar<00:05:16.020> and<00:05:16.289> I<00:05:16.470> don't<00:05:16.530> know

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
goes out into Tyranitar and I don't know

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.080 
goes out into Tyranitar and I don't know
you<00:05:16.889> I<00:05:17.159> don't<00:05:17.250> even<00:05:17.520> know<00:05:17.729> what<00:05:17.909> she<00:05:18.000> was

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
you I don't even know what she was

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.360 
you I don't even know what she was
thinking<00:05:18.150> there<00:05:18.599> she<00:05:19.590> switches<00:05:19.860> out<00:05:20.069> into

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
thinking there she switches out into

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.809 
thinking there she switches out into
Lucario<00:05:20.909> like<00:05:21.750> her<00:05:22.620> Tyranitar<00:05:23.099> is<00:05:23.190> carved<00:05:23.610> and

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:23.819 
Lucario like her Tyranitar is carved and

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:25.969 
Lucario like her Tyranitar is carved and
I<00:05:23.969> think<00:05:24.210> she<00:05:24.330> forgot<00:05:24.629> that<00:05:24.900> like<00:05:25.530> she<00:05:25.860> either

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 
I think she forgot that like she either

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:27.800 
I think she forgot that like she either
remembered<00:05:26.580> it<00:05:26.699> then<00:05:26.909> forgot<00:05:27.300> it<00:05:27.449> and<00:05:27.599> then

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
remembered it then forgot it and then

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.390 
remembered it then forgot it and then
remembered<00:05:28.289> it<00:05:28.379> again<00:05:28.620> because<00:05:28.979> she<00:05:29.099> goes<00:05:29.219> out

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
remembered it again because she goes out

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.170 
remembered it again because she goes out
into<00:05:29.520> Lucario<00:05:30.150> and<00:05:30.449> um<00:05:31.440> I<00:05:31.770> go<00:05:32.699> over<00:05:32.819> the<00:05:32.940> surf

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
into Lucario and um I go over the surf

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.640 
into Lucario and um I go over the surf
on<00:05:33.330> that<00:05:33.509> thing<00:05:33.690> on<00:05:33.810> the<00:05:33.900> switch<00:05:34.169> and<00:05:34.500> that's

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
on that thing on the switch and that's

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.129 
on that thing on the switch and that's
gonna<00:05:34.860> be<00:05:35.009> a<00:05:35.039> to<00:05:35.219> ako<00:05:35.550> as<00:05:35.969> she<00:05:36.509> extreme<00:05:36.870> speeds

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:37.139 
gonna be a to ako as she extreme speeds

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:39.890 
gonna be a to ako as she extreme speeds
me<00:05:37.319> for<00:05:37.500> some<00:05:37.650> damage<00:05:38.069> but<00:05:38.969> then<00:05:39.479> she<00:05:39.659> goes

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
me for some damage but then she goes

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.409 
me for some damage but then she goes
into<00:05:40.080> Tyranitar<00:05:40.650> again<00:05:40.949> and<00:05:41.279> I<00:05:41.729> guess<00:05:42.000> she<00:05:42.270> now

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
into Tyranitar again and I guess she now

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:44.360 
into Tyranitar again and I guess she now
remembers<00:05:42.960> at<00:05:43.110> scarf<00:05:43.409> because<00:05:43.800> now<00:05:43.979> she<00:05:44.039> goes

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
remembers at scarf because now she goes

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.879 
remembers at scarf because now she goes

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:02.530 
fair system in place that cheers Pokemon

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:09.400 
fact that they tear on usage because

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.820 
fact that they tear on usage because
that<00:07:09.640> allows<00:07:10.030> you<00:07:10.270> to<00:07:10.420> see<00:07:10.660> which<00:07:11.020> Pokemon<00:07:11.530> /

centralized the metagame and in my

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:16.440 
centralized the metagame and in my

opinion a lot of people try to tear on
their<00:07:16.870> opinions<00:07:17.380> and<00:07:17.650> you<00:07:17.950> really<00:07:18.280> can't<00:07:18.760> tear

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:23.500 
factual enough I mean they they use the

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.770 
factual enough I mean they they use the

do and that's usage and I don't trust

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.270 
do and that's usage and I don't trust
people's<00:07:29.350> opinions<00:07:29.710> because<00:07:29.890> everyone<00:07:30.160> has<00:07:30.250> a
