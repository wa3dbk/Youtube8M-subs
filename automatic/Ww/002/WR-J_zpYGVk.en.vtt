 our tool is minimal and so well 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.140
 let's get started 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.959
 we find the middle originally today 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:10.030
 these two crazy colors I have to 

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:19.119
 very alyapisto but not at the expense wanted 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:25.310
 find the middle means 1 and this is ours 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:29.899
 middle 2 case loops at the ends here 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:33.349
 turned 22 after the loop 22 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:37.130
 skip one second here and where 

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:42.560
 and now but this step together, we two 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:47.590
 the end of the opposite is allowed here 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.590

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:06.509
 then so you 2 came out and keep it 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.050
 intersection and here is this suppression down 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:12.930
 while letting both of us and getting us so 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.170
 here is a loop here this here will be with us 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:22.799

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:37.140
 which is lowered down and spend it 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:41.900
 look behind and out of the center 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.900
 both go through and go out how to be center 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:50.510
 see yes here were back spun 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:53.540
 and from from the center here we are 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:58.700
 It turned out like we have this 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:01.380
 window yes it is here the windows here you can see 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:05.209
 so here we are in this window a cross on to 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:12.319
 first take the end here this one right and 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:15.590
 back here in this window yes we release 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.590

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:24.629
 then take 2 kitty that's it and the back 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:31.769
 also that is everywhere behind 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:36.220
 go away from here and now friend for boyfriend 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:38.739
 quietly slowly pulls up 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.569
 here do not forget to leave this 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.970
 about the hole that you come in here 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:47.500
 our diamonds knot how are you done 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:49.989
 show up a little later everything and so please 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:54.069
 asking for a pause before that means that's what we 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:56.680
 we have something to stop here so here 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:04:00.190
 everyone m Oleg draw near to have more 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.590
 understandable so let's repeat now these 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.160
 two verde go these two down now here 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.910
 these two 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:10.090
 missing back here so it turns out 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.739
 these two ears and see them first 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:19.060
 right 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:22.570
 skip back then left back they 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:25.470
 intersect principle I think that 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:28.860
 nothing difficult and slowly pulling up 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.860
 friend for friend 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:38.620
 here 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:42.930
 the second procedure of 5 pro already assume 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.930
 now we spend behind 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:51.629
 priests first right then left 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.470
 but closing yes oh sorry 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:11.470
 accounted for by the other course 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:13.410
 keep the node can not tag well well 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:16.720
 that's what happened 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:19.449
 can u back so i pause 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:23.590
 I will try to the end then together I did 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:25.960
 fastener and will be ready on the trail and so 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.229
 But at the end I will end up boldly 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:34.409
 bracelet on the trail river up 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:37.449
 this pin the river here at the end I did 

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:40.090
 doing but yes so called diamond knot 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:44.669
 how to do it can look right here 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:47.830
 Here everything is detailed there are clear 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:49.659
 because on his arm he won't wear 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:53.470
 because it's not very convenient for me alone 

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:56.860
 do it well as it is like this 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:59.050
 alyapisto trick than more pleasant bracelet 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.539
 that he is on hand from supposed to generally 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:06.099
 very different song can mean wearing and 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:10.180
 like this too as an option normally in 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:12.900
 In general, such a 4 color piece 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:15.340
 it turned us up to such a bracelet 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:19.479
 buttoned but it is clear yes then 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:22.419
 just comes here and in the end 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:25.539
 it turns out such a bracelet 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:26.289
 Well, I think nothing cool came out ends 

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:30.069
 got burned 

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:34.599
 yes then analyze residues means 21 

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:37.360
 centime turned out yes for the remnants means 

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:40.050
 two pieces like that about the fact that 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:44.460
 we made of this color, give a whip and 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:48.400
 these little bit more well 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:51.699
 approximately 25. well left 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:55.000
 30 of these well there you can calculate for 

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:58.530
 it is generally normal for me these pieces 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:02.199
 remains in principle all bracelet ready 

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:06.479
