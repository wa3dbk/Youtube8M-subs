hi this is drew valence with satellite

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:05.930 
hi this is drew valence with satellite
test<00:00:04.200> prep<00:00:04.529> and<00:00:05.130> today<00:00:05.370> we're<00:00:05.549> gonna<00:00:05.640> work<00:00:05.819> on

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
test prep and today we're gonna work on

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.670 
test prep and today we're gonna work on
an<00:00:06.089> a<00:00:06.180> CT<00:00:06.540> math<00:00:06.779> question<00:00:07.259> involving

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
an a CT math question involving

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.759 
an a CT math question involving
imaginary<00:00:08.309> numbers<00:00:09.349> imaginary<00:00:10.349> numbers<00:00:10.679> is

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
imaginary numbers imaginary numbers is

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.740 
imaginary numbers imaginary numbers is
one<00:00:10.920> of<00:00:11.010> those<00:00:11.099> parts<00:00:11.490> of<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.700> a<00:00:11.730> CT<00:00:12.150> math<00:00:12.360> that

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
one of those parts of the a CT math that

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.740 
one of those parts of the a CT math that
goes<00:00:12.929> beyond<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.679> SAT<00:00:14.040> so<00:00:15.030> it's<00:00:15.330> important

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
goes beyond the SAT so it's important

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.029 
goes beyond the SAT so it's important
that<00:00:15.780> we<00:00:15.929> know<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.109> couple<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.529> things

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
that we know a couple of things

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.570 
that we know a couple of things
let's<00:00:17.550> take<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.789> look<00:00:18.650> if<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.859> square<00:00:20.189> root<00:00:20.430> of

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
let's take a look if the square root of

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.090 
let's take a look if the square root of
three<00:00:20.910> x<00:00:21.119> equals<00:00:22.050> six

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
three x equals six

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.339 
three x equals six
I<00:00:23.420> then<00:00:24.420> x<00:00:24.779> equals<00:00:25.350> what<00:00:26.779> first<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:27.930> all<00:00:28.109> if<00:00:28.230> you

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
I then x equals what first of all if you

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.720 
I then x equals what first of all if you
want<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.590> take<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.769> shot<00:00:29.010> at<00:00:29.130> this<00:00:29.220> question<00:00:29.609> on

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
want to take a shot at this question on

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.880 
want to take a shot at this question on
your<00:00:29.849> own<00:00:30.029> press<00:00:30.810> pause<00:00:31.199> now<00:00:33.680> okay

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
your own press pause now okay

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.650 
your own press pause now okay
so<00:00:35.219> right<00:00:36.210> off<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.450> bat<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:37.500> must<00:00:37.829> know<00:00:38.219> that

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
so right off the bat you must know that

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:45.410 
so right off the bat you must know that
I<00:00:39.660> squared<00:00:40.230> equals<00:00:42.559> negative<00:00:43.559> one<00:00:44.160> if<00:00:45.059> you

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
I squared equals negative one if you

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.209 
I squared equals negative one if you
already<00:00:45.600> knew<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:45.870> great<00:00:46.469> if<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:46.890> didn't

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
already knew that great if you didn't

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.049 
already knew that great if you didn't
remember<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.329> commit<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.870> memory<00:00:50.059> it

remember it and commit it to memory it
will<00:00:51.239> help<00:00:51.480> us<00:00:51.660> on<00:00:51.870> this<00:00:52.110> question<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:52.829> let's

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
will help us on this question so let's

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.049 
will help us on this question so let's
write<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:53.309> out<00:00:53.670> root<00:00:54.300> three<00:00:54.719> x<00:00:54.960> equals<00:00:55.940> six<00:00:56.940> I

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
write this out root three x equals six I

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.979 
write this out root three x equals six I
what<00:01:00.059> we<00:01:00.180> have<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.390> do<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.629> we<00:01:00.719> have<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.840> get

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
what we have to do is we have to get

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.280 
what we have to do is we have to get
this<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.640> into<00:01:02.640> an<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.910> squared<00:01:02.969> form<00:01:03.960> that's<00:01:04.170> the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
this I into an I squared form that's the

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.479 
this I into an I squared form that's the
only<00:01:04.470> way<00:01:04.559> we're<00:01:04.680> gonna<00:01:04.739> be<00:01:04.949> able<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.159> turn<00:01:05.339> it

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
only way we're gonna be able to turn it

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.789 
only way we're gonna be able to turn it
into<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.729> real<00:01:06.000> number<00:01:06.240> as<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.560> right<00:01:07.770> now

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
into a real number as it is right now

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.469 
into a real number as it is right now
it's<00:01:08.100> just<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.430> letter<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.700> we<00:01:09.150> don't<00:01:09.299> know

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
it's just the letter I we don't know

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.630 
it's just the letter I we don't know
what<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.720> do<00:01:09.869> with<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.049> so<00:01:11.040> what<00:01:11.220> we<00:01:11.310> can<00:01:11.460> do

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
what to do with that so what we can do

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.850 
what to do with that so what we can do
to<00:01:11.790> make<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:12.119> into<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.600> squared<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.380> square<00:01:13.680> it

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
to make I into I squared is square it

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.120 
to make I into I squared is square it
but<00:01:14.700> if<00:01:14.820> we<00:01:14.939> Square<00:01:15.240> this<00:01:15.450> side<00:01:15.920> we<00:01:16.920> have<00:01:17.040> to

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
but if we Square this side we have to

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.100 
but if we Square this side we have to
square<00:01:17.340> everything<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:18.150> then<00:01:18.630> we<00:01:18.840> have<00:01:18.960> to

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
square everything and then we have to

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.820 
square everything and then we have to
square<00:01:19.439> this<00:01:20.220> side<00:01:20.520> too<00:01:20.790> it's<00:01:21.000> only<00:01:21.150> fair<00:01:21.830> so

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
square this side too it's only fair so

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.920 
square this side too it's only fair so
what<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.030> square<00:01:24.210> root<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.509> three<00:01:24.780> x

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
what is the square root of three x

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.249 
what is the square root of three x
squared<00:01:25.710> well<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.820> square<00:01:27.119> cancels<00:01:27.869> out<00:01:28.020> this

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
squared well the square cancels out this

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.289 
squared well the square cancels out this
square<00:01:28.560> root<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.070> we<00:01:29.100> end<00:01:29.340> up<00:01:29.460> just<00:01:29.850> with<00:01:30.060> three

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
square root so we end up just with three

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.760 
square root so we end up just with three
X<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:31.100> what<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.130> 6i<00:01:32.729> squared<00:01:33.140> well<00:01:34.140> 6<00:01:34.530> squared

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
X and what is 6i squared well 6 squared

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.530 
X and what is 6i squared well 6 squared
is<00:01:34.890> 36<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:36.829> I<00:01:37.829> squared<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.610> just<00:01:38.900> x<00:01:39.900> squared

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
is 36 and I squared is just x squared

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.010 
is 36 and I squared is just x squared
now<00:01:42.540> we<00:01:42.570> have<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.229> squared<00:01:44.060> like<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:45.420> so

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
now we have the I squared like this so

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.960 
now we have the I squared like this so
we<00:01:46.170> can<00:01:46.320> substitute<00:01:46.680> negative<00:01:47.100> 1<00:01:47.520> in<00:01:47.670> 4<00:01:47.850> I

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
we can substitute negative 1 in 4 I

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.480 
we can substitute negative 1 in 4 I
squared<00:01:48.229> so<00:01:49.229> we<00:01:49.350> have<00:01:49.970> 36<00:01:51.200> times<00:01:52.200> negative<00:01:53.040> 1

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
squared so we have 36 times negative 1

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.760 
squared so we have 36 times negative 1
equals<00:01:54.140> 3x<00:01:56.509> continuing<00:01:57.509> down<00:01:57.750> 3x<00:01:58.439> equals

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
equals 3x continuing down 3x equals

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.289 
equals 3x continuing down 3x equals
negative<00:01:59.159> 36<00:02:00.439> and<00:02:01.439> if<00:02:02.219> we<00:02:02.369> divide<00:02:02.700> both<00:02:02.939> sides

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
negative 36 and if we divide both sides

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.499 
negative 36 and if we divide both sides
by<00:02:03.479> 3<00:02:03.960> because<00:02:04.200> we're<00:02:04.380> solving<00:02:04.590> for<00:02:04.799> x<00:02:05.509> 36

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
by 3 because we're solving for x 36

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.339 
by 3 because we're solving for x 36
divided<00:02:07.170> by<00:02:07.200> 3<00:02:07.649> is<00:02:08.160> 12<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.940> it's<00:02:09.149> negative<00:02:09.390> so

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
divided by 3 is 12 and it's negative so

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.430 
divided by 3 is 12 and it's negative so
X<00:02:10.619> is<00:02:10.800> equal<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.239> negative<00:02:12.239> 12

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
X is equal to negative 12

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.960 
X is equal to negative 12
