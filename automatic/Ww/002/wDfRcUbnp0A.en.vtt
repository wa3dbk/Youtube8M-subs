00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210 

this<00:00:00.810> rule<00:00:01.020> right<00:00:01.170> here<00:00:01.439> is<00:00:01.560> an<00:00:01.680> example<00:00:02.010> of

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
this rule right here is an example of

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.130 
this rule right here is an example of
head<00:00:02.429> prune<00:00:02.700> vines<00:00:03.000> so<00:00:03.629> we'll<00:00:03.750> go<00:00:03.870> ahead<00:00:03.899> and

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
head prune vines so we'll go ahead and

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.900 
head prune vines so we'll go ahead and
give<00:00:04.560> a<00:00:04.589> little<00:00:04.740> demonstration<00:00:04.980> about<00:00:05.700> it<00:00:05.819> to

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
give a little demonstration about it to

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.430 
give a little demonstration about it to
some<00:00:06.150> take<00:00:06.299> a<00:00:06.330> look<00:00:06.509> at<00:00:06.629> this<00:00:06.750> vine<00:00:07.020> it's<00:00:07.259> got

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
some take a look at this vine it's got

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.709 
some take a look at this vine it's got
all<00:00:07.649> kinds<00:00:07.980> of<00:00:08.069> growth<00:00:08.340> coming<00:00:09.240> out<00:00:09.450> up<00:00:09.690> here

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
all kinds of growth coming out up here

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.720 
all kinds of growth coming out up here
we're<00:00:10.469> going<00:00:10.590> to<00:00:10.650> try<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:10.889> do<00:00:10.980> is<00:00:11.130> cut<00:00:11.460> it<00:00:11.550> back

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
we're going to try and do is cut it back

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.410 
we're going to try and do is cut it back
down<00:00:12.480> here<00:00:12.960> so<00:00:13.830> that<00:00:14.009> way<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.969> growth<00:00:15.210> will<00:00:15.389> be

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
down here so that way the growth will be

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.359 
down here so that way the growth will be
coming<00:00:15.780> up<00:00:15.900> it'll<00:00:16.230> be<00:00:16.260> close<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.710> here<00:00:16.949> instead

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
coming up it'll be close to here instead

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.980 
coming up it'll be close to here instead
of<00:00:17.670> it<00:00:17.789> turning<00:00:18.029> into<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.270> tree<00:00:18.570> we're<00:00:18.810> trying

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
of it turning into a tree we're trying

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.109 
of it turning into a tree we're trying
to<00:00:19.080> kind<00:00:19.199> of<00:00:19.350> cut<00:00:19.500> it<00:00:19.590> back<00:00:19.770> so<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:20.730> looks<00:00:20.760> more

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
to kind of cut it back so it looks more

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.170 
to kind of cut it back so it looks more
like<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.270> rose<00:00:21.510> clippers<00:00:22.050> into<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.430> mixture<00:00:23.970> here

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
like a rose clippers into a mixture here

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.790 
like a rose clippers into a mixture here
to<00:00:24.269> sterilize<00:00:24.689> in<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.900> bit<00:00:25.140> this<00:00:25.350> has<00:00:25.410> some

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
to sterilize in a bit this has some

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.040 
to sterilize in a bit this has some
chlorine<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.369> water<00:00:26.609> mixed<00:00:27.000> in<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.720> that<00:00:27.900> way

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
chlorine and water mixed in and that way

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:38.690 
chlorine and water mixed in and that way
we<00:00:28.199> can<00:00:28.349> avoid<00:00:29.179> transferring<00:00:30.179> diseases<00:00:37.700> what

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
we can avoid transferring diseases what

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.270 
we can avoid transferring diseases what
I<00:00:38.730> might<00:00:39.030> do<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.360> start<00:00:39.719> by<00:00:39.989> taking<00:00:40.680> this<00:00:41.040> off

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
I might do is start by taking this off

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.030 
I might do is start by taking this off
right<00:00:42.030> about<00:00:42.300> there<00:00:42.629> again<00:00:42.960> lopers<00:00:43.410> might<00:00:43.890> be

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
right about there again lopers might be

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.069 
right about there again lopers might be
a<00:00:44.070> little<00:00:44.280> bit<00:00:44.370> easier<00:00:44.550> but<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.420> can<00:00:45.600> just<00:00:45.840> about

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
a little bit easier but I can just about

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.700 
a little bit easier but I can just about
manage<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.460> think<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:48.480> Clippers<00:00:48.710> so

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
manage this I think the Clippers so

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.750 
manage this I think the Clippers so
we'll<00:00:49.829> go<00:00:49.950> ahead<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.370> keep<00:00:50.579> two<00:00:50.850> buds<00:00:51.680> there

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
we'll go ahead and keep two buds there

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.840 
we'll go ahead and keep two buds there
this<00:00:53.760> is<00:00:54.030> quite<00:00:54.360> good<00:00:54.860> right<00:00:55.860> up<00:00:56.070> here<00:00:57.500> so

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
this is quite good right up here so

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.240 
this is quite good right up here so
might<00:00:59.850> keep<00:01:00.149> might<00:01:00.570> keep<00:01:00.780> these<00:01:01.250> although

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
might keep might keep these although

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.410 
might keep might keep these although
this<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.640> starting<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:02.940> get<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.059> little<00:01:03.180> bit

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
this is starting to get a little bit

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.500 
this is starting to get a little bit
high<00:01:03.600> up<00:01:03.629> so<00:01:04.589> what<00:01:04.860> we<00:01:05.010> may<00:01:05.220> do<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.820> we'll<00:01:06.180> keep

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
high up so what we may do is we'll keep

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.020 
high up so what we may do is we'll keep
a<00:01:06.659> couple<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:07.140> buds<00:01:10.340> what<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.369> might<00:01:11.640> see<00:01:11.820> then

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
a couple of buds what I might see then

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.990 
a couple of buds what I might see then
is<00:01:12.180> tape<00:01:12.450> at<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.659> top<00:01:12.780> off<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:14.280> here<00:01:14.670> again

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
is tape at the top off of here again

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.999 
is tape at the top off of here again
we're<00:01:15.150> trying<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.479> keep<00:01:15.689> things<00:01:15.960> close<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.560> the

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
we're trying to keep things close to the

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.090 
we're trying to keep things close to the
trunk<00:01:17.369> here<00:01:18.110> but<00:01:19.110> that's<00:01:19.290> not<00:01:19.500> too<00:01:19.710> bad<00:01:19.890> so

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
trunk here but that's not too bad so

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.899 
trunk here but that's not too bad so
we'll<00:01:20.250> go<00:01:20.369> ahead<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.670> keep<00:01:21.710> right<00:01:22.710> there<00:01:23.009> this

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
we'll go ahead and keep right there this

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.300 
we'll go ahead and keep right there this
is<00:01:24.090> quite<00:01:24.420> good<00:01:24.450> right<00:01:24.960> here

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
is quite good right here

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.890 
is quite good right here
one<00:01:27.030> couple<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.600> buds<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.820> I<00:01:29.820> might<00:01:30.210> also<00:01:30.479> just

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
one couple of buds and I might also just

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.289 
one couple of buds and I might also just
keep<00:01:31.110> this<00:01:31.380> one<00:01:31.439> right<00:01:31.890> now<00:01:32.130> I'll<00:01:32.939> cut<00:01:33.119> this

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299

think I need a saw or the ropers the
lowepro<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.040> right<00:01:44.220> about<00:01:44.430> here<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.880> cut<00:01:45.119> down

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
lowepro is right about here to cut down

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.389 
lowepro is right about here to cut down
this<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.259> just<00:01:46.350> too<00:01:46.560> much<00:01:46.740> too<00:01:46.979> much<00:01:47.100> growth

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
this is just too much too much growth

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.889 
this is just too much too much growth
going<00:01:47.729> on<00:01:48.000> there<00:01:48.470> let<00:01:49.470> me<00:01:49.500> just<00:01:49.770> go<00:01:49.920> ahead<00:01:50.899> and

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
going on there let me just go ahead and

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:59.179 
going on there let me just go ahead and
get<00:01:52.259> this<00:01:52.470> out<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.770> way<00:01:54.229> okay<00:01:56.329> but<00:01:57.799> what<00:01:58.799> my

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
get this out of the way okay but what my

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.359 
get this out of the way okay but what my
objective<00:01:59.729> now<00:01:59.880> will<00:02:00.210> be<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.450> go<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:01.369> cut

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
objective now will be to go and cut

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:28.729 
objective now will be to go and cut
right<00:02:02.719> there<00:02:26.660> now<00:02:27.660> I<00:02:27.870> really<00:02:28.349> need<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:28.530> look

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
right there now I really need to look

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.710 
right there now I really need to look
worse<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.190> do<00:02:29.340> that<00:02:29.520> it's<00:02:29.849> a<00:02:30.000> little<00:02:30.300> bit<00:02:30.480> too

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
worse to do that it's a little bit too

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:42.259 
worse to do that it's a little bit too
tight<00:02:39.980> and<00:02:40.980> again<00:02:41.069> what<00:02:41.340> I<00:02:41.370> think<00:02:41.640> I'll<00:02:41.790> do<00:02:42.000> is
