00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.670 
but truthfully I found it an amazing
course<00:04:03.569> it's<00:04:04.019> only<00:04:04.169> one<00:04:04.560> hour<00:04:04.590> per<00:04:05.159> week<00:04:05.189> and

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
and I learned so much I found my way

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.929 
and I learned so much I found my way
around<00:04:10.169> a<00:04:10.590> lot<00:04:10.919> it<00:04:11.220> helped<00:04:11.639> me<00:04:11.759> a<00:04:11.790> lot

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:11.939 
around a lot it helped me a lot

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:13.789 
around a lot it helped me a lot
personally<00:04:12.269> but<00:04:12.870> other<00:04:13.049> than<00:04:13.199> that<00:04:13.319> the

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
personally but other than that the

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.420 
personally but other than that the

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
highlight of the schedule has to be the

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.589 
highlight of the schedule has to be the
fact<00:04:17.639> that<00:04:17.759> we<00:04:17.909> don't<00:04:18.000> have<00:04:18.090> classes<00:04:18.539> on
