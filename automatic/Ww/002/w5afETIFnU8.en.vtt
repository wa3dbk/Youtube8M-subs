00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
have to look at this bad boy this is the

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.590 
have to look at this bad boy this is the
Fulton<00:03:38.360> farmer<00:03:39.140> is<00:03:39.410> in<00:03:40.250> pharmacy<00:03:40.940> not<00:03:41.150> harbor

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
Fulton farmer is in pharmacy not harbor

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.319 
Fulton farmer is in pharmacy not harbor
um<00:03:42.230> eyelash<00:03:43.160> and<00:03:43.310> eyebrow<00:03:43.430> treatment<00:03:44.180> for

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
um eyelash and eyebrow treatment for

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:46.150 
um eyelash and eyebrow treatment for
strongest<00:03:44.780> FL<00:03:45.140> longer<00:03:45.530> eyelashes<00:03:46.040> and

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
strongest FL longer eyelashes and

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.229 
strongest FL longer eyelashes and
eyebrows<00:03:46.519> so<00:03:47.450> I'm<00:03:47.540> guessing<00:03:47.780> this<00:03:48.170> is<00:03:48.350> like<00:03:48.680> a

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
eyebrows so I'm guessing this is like a

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.830 
eyebrows so I'm guessing this is like a
cheaper<00:03:50.239> version<00:03:50.269> or<00:03:51.310> alternative<00:03:52.310> to

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
cheaper version or alternative to

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.110 
cheaper version or alternative to
revitalash<00:03:53.840> so<00:03:54.680> this<00:03:54.890> retails<00:03:55.519> at<00:03:55.730> twenty

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
revitalash so this retails at twenty

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.759 
revitalash so this retails at twenty
dollars<00:03:56.299> 95<00:03:56.570> so<00:03:56.989> if<00:03:57.079> this<00:03:57.230> works<00:03:57.500> it's

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
dollars 95 so if this works it's

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.500 
dollars 95 so if this works it's
actually<00:03:58.040> a<00:03:58.100> really<00:03:58.310> really<00:03:58.519> good<00:03:58.730> price<00:03:59.030> and

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
actually a really really good price and

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.440
