like<00:01:57.570> in<00:01:57.840> game<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.320> expected<00:01:59.000> Messi<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.149> feel<00:02:00.390> a

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
like in game I expected Messi to feel a

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.810 
like in game I expected Messi to feel a
little<00:02:00.780> bit<00:02:01.049> better<00:02:01.290> but<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.250> way<00:02:02.399> that<00:02:02.579> EA

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
little bit better but the way that EA

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.310 
little bit better but the way that EA
have<00:02:03.060> made<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.390> team<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.750> year<00:02:03.780> Ronaldo

in<00:02:04.439> this<00:02:04.560> game<00:02:04.799> is<00:02:05.100> just<00:02:05.369> ridiculous<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.210> I

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
in this game is just ridiculous and I

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.240 
in this game is just ridiculous and I
gotta<00:02:06.570> say<00:02:06.780> this<00:02:06.930> pretty<00:02:07.170> much<00:02:07.350> no<00:02:07.680> difference

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
gotta say this pretty much no difference

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.430 
gotta say this pretty much no difference
so<00:02:08.520> if<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:09.090> thinking<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:09.750> know<00:02:09.869> Messi<00:02:10.410> is

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
so if you thinking you know Messi is

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.860 
so if you thinking you know Messi is
gonna<00:02:10.649> be<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.800> lot<00:02:11.039> better<00:02:11.220> at

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
gonna be a lot better at

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.420 
gonna be a lot better at
even<00:02:12.379> though<00:02:12.470> their<00:02:12.650> stats<00:02:12.920> are<00:02:13.099> the<00:02:13.190> same

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
even though their stats are the same

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.850 
even though their stats are the same
from<00:02:14.060> my<00:02:14.299> personal<00:02:14.870> opinion<00:02:15.319> I<00:02:15.440> gotta<00:02:15.680> say

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
from my personal opinion I gotta say

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.530 
from my personal opinion I gotta say
there's<00:02:16.069> not<00:02:16.280> much<00:02:16.489> difference<00:02:16.519> now<00:02:17.239> like<00:02:17.420> I

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
there's not much difference now like I

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.140 
there's not much difference now like I
was<00:02:17.569> saying<00:02:17.720> Macy<00:02:18.590> shoot<00:02:19.010> in<00:02:19.220> is<00:02:19.430> ridiculous

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549 
and using his amazing dribbling to just

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:24.670 
and using his amazing dribbling to just
drift<00:02:22.849> in<00:02:23.060> and<00:02:23.299> out<00:02:23.390> of<00:02:23.450> Defense's<00:02:24.260> through

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
drift in and out of Defense's through

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.880 
drift in and out of Defense's through
teams<00:02:25.099> is<00:02:25.370> just<00:02:25.940> ridiculously<00:02:26.690> easy<00:02:26.810> and<00:02:27.500> like

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
that I played he felt like 97 pace in my

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.530 
that I played he felt like 97 pace in my
opinion<00:03:18.769> he<00:03:19.130> was<00:03:19.280> blasting<00:03:19.549> through<00:03:20.209> teams

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
opinion he was blasting through teams

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.289
