00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
hello class dr. Anderson here let's talk

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.890 
hello class dr. Anderson here let's talk
about<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.630> leaning<00:00:10.530> ladder<00:00:10.860> problem<00:00:11.700> so<00:00:12.630> in

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
about the leaning ladder problem so in

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.230 
about the leaning ladder problem so in
this<00:00:13.020> problem<00:00:13.320> we<00:00:13.890> have<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.220> following<00:00:14.460> setup

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
this problem we have the following setup

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.440 
this problem we have the following setup
we<00:00:15.540> have<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:16.520> floor<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:18.050> a<00:00:19.050> wall<00:00:19.290> and<00:00:20.240> we<00:00:21.240> have<00:00:21.270> a

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:21.450 
we have a floor and a wall and we have a

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.589 
we have a floor and a wall and we have a
ladder<00:00:21.840> that's<00:00:22.829> leaning<00:00:23.310> against<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:24.119> wall

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:24.599 
ladder that's leaning against the wall

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.900 
ladder that's leaning against the wall
now<00:00:25.380> there's<00:00:25.650> friction<00:00:26.220> on<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.480> floor<00:00:28.910> with

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
now there's friction on the floor with

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.930 
now there's friction on the floor with
coefficient<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:30.779> friction<00:00:31.200> mu<00:00:31.649> sub<00:00:31.919> s<00:00:32.130> the

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
coefficient of friction mu sub s the

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.709 
coefficient of friction mu sub s the
wall<00:00:33.210> is<00:00:33.710> frictionless<00:00:34.970> now<00:00:35.970> let's<00:00:36.180> say<00:00:36.329> we<00:00:36.539> do

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
wall is frictionless now let's say we do

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.689 
wall is frictionless now let's say we do
the<00:00:36.870> following<00:00:37.379> let's<00:00:37.739> say<00:00:37.920> we<00:00:38.100> ask<00:00:38.309> the

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:38.699 
the following let's say we ask the

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:44.360 
the following let's say we ask the
question<00:00:39.660> how<00:00:40.399> far<00:00:41.399> up<00:00:41.820> can<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.809> person<00:00:43.469> climb

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
question how far up can a person climb

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.590 
question how far up can a person climb
on<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.600> ladder<00:00:46.070> before<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.789> ladder<00:00:48.030> slips

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
on the ladder before the ladder slips

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.259 
on the ladder before the ladder slips
and<00:00:48.960> falls<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.859> you're<00:00:50.160> all<00:00:50.309> sort<00:00:51.179> of

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:51.269 
and falls and you're all sort of

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:52.759 
and falls and you're all sort of
familiar<00:00:51.629> with<00:00:51.780> this<00:00:51.929> idea<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.440> know<00:00:52.589> when

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:52.769 
familiar with this idea you know when

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:54.950 
familiar with this idea you know when
you<00:00:52.859> lean<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.100> ladder<00:00:53.460> up<00:00:54.089> against<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.539> wall<00:00:54.719> if

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
you lean a ladder up against the wall if

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.540 
you lean a ladder up against the wall if
you're<00:00:55.079> down<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.379> bottom<00:00:55.800> it's<00:00:55.949> stable<00:00:56.399> but

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
you're down the bottom it's stable but

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.119 
you're down the bottom it's stable but
as<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.789> go<00:00:56.940> further<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.420> further<00:00:57.570> up<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.800> can

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
as you go further and further up it can

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.209 
as you go further and further up it can
get<00:00:59.339> unstable<00:01:00.179> and<00:01:00.300> eventually<00:01:00.780> fall<00:01:01.019> so<00:01:01.980> how

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
get unstable and eventually fall so how

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.930 
get unstable and eventually fall so how
would<00:01:02.280> we<00:01:02.489> model<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:03.359> problem<00:01:04.070> well<00:01:05.070> let's

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
would we model this problem well let's

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.740 
would we model this problem well let's
draw<00:01:06.120> the<00:01:06.240> ladder<00:01:06.540> again<00:01:07.440> and<00:01:08.060> the<00:01:09.060> ladder<00:01:09.330> has

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
draw the ladder again and the ladder has

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.130 
draw the ladder again and the ladder has
length<00:01:10.410> L<00:01:12.050> let's<00:01:13.050> say<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.620> the<00:01:13.800> person<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:15.140> a

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
length L let's say that the person is a

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.920 
length L let's say that the person is a
distance<00:01:16.800> X<00:01:18.260> up<00:01:19.260> the<00:01:19.500> ladder<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.390> the<00:01:21.390> angle

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
distance X up the ladder and the angle

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.570 
distance X up the ladder and the angle
between<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.440> ladder<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.010> floor<00:01:23.310> is

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
between the ladder and the floor is

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.540 
between the ladder and the floor is
Theta<00:01:24.470> all<00:01:25.470> right<00:01:25.680> so<00:01:25.890> now<00:01:26.040> with<00:01:26.250> all<00:01:26.370> this

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
Theta all right so now with all this

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.850 
Theta all right so now with all this
stuff<00:01:26.930> let's<00:01:27.930> see<00:01:28.110> if<00:01:28.200> we<00:01:28.350> can<00:01:28.530> think<00:01:28.710> about

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
stuff let's see if we can think about

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.940 
stuff let's see if we can think about
the<00:01:29.730> forces<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.080> torques<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.740> are

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
the forces and the torques that are

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.470 
the forces and the torques that are
acting<00:01:32.490> on<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:33.240> ladder<00:01:33.950> so<00:01:35.240> down<00:01:36.240> at<00:01:36.450> the

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:36.480 
acting on the ladder so down at the

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.200 
acting on the ladder so down at the
bottom<00:01:36.780> we<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.410> course<00:01:37.770> have<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.640> normal

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
bottom we of course have the normal

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:46.010 
bottom we of course have the normal
force<00:01:40.970> and<00:01:42.830> there<00:01:43.830> is<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.520> static<00:01:45.390> frictional

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
force and there is a static frictional

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.950 
force and there is a static frictional
force<00:01:46.350> which<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:46.950> trying<00:01:47.190> to<00:01:47.280> keep<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:48.570> bottom

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
force which is trying to keep the bottom

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.680 
force which is trying to keep the bottom
of<00:01:49.080> that<00:01:49.170> ladder<00:01:49.470> in<00:01:49.800> place<00:01:50.010> so<00:01:50.850> that's<00:01:50.970> F<00:01:51.360> sub

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
of that ladder in place so that's F sub

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.970 
of that ladder in place so that's F sub
s<00:01:53.060> there<00:01:54.060> is<00:01:54.140> the<00:01:55.140> weight<00:01:55.440> of<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:56.550> ladder<00:01:56.790> M

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:57.980 
s there is the weight of the ladder M

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:04.100 
s there is the weight of the ladder M
sub<00:01:58.980> L<00:01:59.330> times<00:02:00.330> G<00:02:01.190> there<00:02:02.190> is<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.850> weight<00:02:03.150> of<00:02:03.450> the

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
sub L times G there is the weight of the

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.339 
sub L times G there is the weight of the
person<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:05.810> sub<00:02:06.810> P<00:02:07.429> times<00:02:08.429> G<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.209> there's<00:02:10.110> one

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
person and sub P times G and there's one

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.730 
person and sub P times G and there's one
more<00:02:10.590> thing<00:02:10.890> which<00:02:11.129> is<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.640> push<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:13.530> wall

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
more thing which is the push of the wall

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.130 
more thing which is the push of the wall
on<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.940> top<00:02:15.150> of<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.360> ladder

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
on the top of the ladder

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.520 
on the top of the ladder
all<00:02:16.710> right<00:02:16.860> so<00:02:17.100> that's<00:02:17.280> our<00:02:17.930> force<00:02:18.930> diagram

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
all right so that's our force diagram

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.070 
all right so that's our force diagram
and<00:02:19.640> now<00:02:20.640> let's<00:02:20.940> think<00:02:21.030> about<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.600> forces

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
and now let's think about the forces

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.699 
and now let's think about the forces
that<00:02:22.530> are<00:02:22.709> acting<00:02:22.950> on<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.940> ladder<00:02:24.209> and<00:02:24.720> also

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
that are acting on the ladder and also

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.230 
that are acting on the ladder and also
the<00:02:25.890> torques<00:02:26.340> that<00:02:26.520> are<00:02:26.640> acting<00:02:27.000> on<00:02:27.090> the

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
the torques that are acting on the

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.199 
the torques that are acting on the
ladder<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:28.290> let's<00:02:28.590> make<00:02:28.770> a<00:02:28.830> little<00:02:29.220> let's

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
ladder and let's make a little let's

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.000 
ladder and let's make a little let's
make<00:02:30.360> a<00:02:30.390> little<00:02:30.569> room<00:02:30.810> well<00:02:31.140> make<00:02:31.680> some<00:02:31.709> room

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
make a little room well make some room

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:40.340 
make a little room well make some room
over<00:02:32.160> here<00:02:35.690> okay<00:02:36.720> so<00:02:38.000> we<00:02:39.000> have<00:02:39.209> some<00:02:39.900> of<00:02:39.930> the

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
over here okay so we have some of the

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.250 
over here okay so we have some of the
forces<00:02:40.650> in<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.250> x-direction<00:02:42.080> what<00:02:43.080> are<00:02:43.200> the

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
forces in the x-direction what are the

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.920 
forces in the x-direction what are the

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
y-direction in the Y direction we have

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.070 
y-direction in the Y direction we have
normal<00:03:02.550> force<00:03:02.850> n<00:03:03.230> going<00:03:04.230> up<00:03:05.120> we<00:03:06.120> have<00:03:06.360> the

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
normal force n going up we have the

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.449 
normal force n going up we have the
weight<00:03:07.320> of<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.590> ladder<00:03:08.180> ml<00:03:09.180> g<00:03:09.570> going<00:03:10.230> down<00:03:10.459> we

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
weight of the ladder ml g going down we

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.630 
weight of the ladder ml g going down we
have<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:11.700> weight<00:03:11.850> of<00:03:11.880> the<00:03:12.000> person<00:03:12.890> going<00:03:13.890> down

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
have the weight of the person going down

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.430 
have the weight of the person going down
and<00:03:15.650> that<00:03:16.650> is<00:03:17.040> it<00:03:17.430> all<00:03:17.880> of<00:03:17.910> that<00:03:18.480> has<00:03:18.959> to<00:03:19.230> add<00:03:19.410> up

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
and that is it all of that has to add up

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.000 
and that is it all of that has to add up
to<00:03:19.920> zero<00:03:21.170> all<00:03:22.170> right<00:03:22.290> so<00:03:22.440> that's<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.709> easy

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
to zero all right so that's the easy

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.490 
to zero all right so that's the easy
part<00:03:23.160> of<00:03:23.519> the<00:03:23.579> problem<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.780> hard<00:03:25.049> part<00:03:25.320> of<00:03:25.410> the

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
part of the problem the hard part of the

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.630 
part of the problem the hard part of the
problem<00:03:25.950> is<00:03:26.360> identifying<00:03:27.360> all<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:28.140> torques

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
problem is identifying all the torques

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.020 
problem is identifying all the torques
now<00:03:30.410> when<00:03:31.410> you<00:03:31.680> write<00:03:31.920> down<00:03:31.980> some<00:03:32.820> of<00:03:32.940> the

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
now when you write down some of the

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.039 
now when you write down some of the
torques<00:03:33.480> you<00:03:33.720> have<00:03:33.930> to<00:03:34.170> immediately<00:03:34.739> pick<00:03:35.610> an

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
torques you have to immediately pick an

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.979 
torques you have to immediately pick an
axis<00:03:37.049> of<00:03:37.380> rotation<00:03:38.010> so<00:03:38.610> let's<00:03:39.420> pick<00:03:39.720> this

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
axis of rotation so let's pick this

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.420 
axis of rotation so let's pick this
point<00:03:40.410> right<00:03:40.709> here<00:03:41.340> at<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.720> ground<00:03:42.989> as<00:03:43.440> our

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
point right here at the ground as our

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.590 
point right here at the ground as our
axis<00:03:45.030> of<00:03:45.239> rotation<00:03:46.850> by<00:03:47.850> doing<00:03:48.150> that<00:03:48.269> we

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
axis of rotation by doing that we

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.789 
axis of rotation by doing that we
immediately<00:03:49.019> eliminate<00:03:49.980> N<00:03:50.220> and<00:03:50.790> F<00:03:51.420> sub<00:03:51.750> s<00:03:52.049> from

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
immediately eliminate N and F sub s from

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.120 
immediately eliminate N and F sub s from
our<00:03:52.980> torque<00:03:53.370> equation<00:03:54.079> because<00:03:55.079> they<00:03:55.980> don't

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
our torque equation because they don't

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.560 
our torque equation because they don't
have<00:03:56.280> any<00:03:56.430> lever<00:03:56.640> arm<00:03:56.880> they<00:03:57.090> go<00:03:57.209> right<00:03:57.420> through

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
have any lever arm they go right through

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.170 
have any lever arm they go right through
the<00:03:57.750> axis<00:03:58.140> of<00:03:58.260> rotation<00:03:58.410> but<00:03:59.010> what<00:03:59.850> about<00:04:00.030> all

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
the axis of rotation but what about all

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.590 
the axis of rotation but what about all
these<00:04:00.299> other<00:04:00.450> forces<00:04:00.890> alright<00:04:01.940> we<00:04:02.940> have<00:04:03.209> the

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
these other forces alright we have the

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.789 
these other forces alright we have the
weight<00:04:03.900> of<00:04:04.079> the<00:04:04.140> ladder<00:04:04.380> so<00:04:05.370> it<00:04:05.910> is<00:04:06.780> trying<00:04:07.620> to

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
weight of the ladder so it is trying to

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.720 
weight of the ladder so it is trying to
rotate<00:04:08.459> this<00:04:09.030> way<00:04:09.299> clockwise<00:04:10.170> clockwise<00:04:11.130> is

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
rotate this way clockwise clockwise is

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.300 
rotate this way clockwise clockwise is
negative<00:04:12.540> by<00:04:12.840> our<00:04:12.989> convention<00:04:13.320> so<00:04:13.950> we<00:04:14.070> put<00:04:14.280> a

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
negative by our convention so we put a

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:20.900 
negative by our convention so we put a
minus<00:04:14.970> sign<00:04:17.989> the<00:04:18.989> weight<00:04:19.289> is<00:04:19.560> MLG<00:04:20.430> so<00:04:20.700> that's

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
minus sign the weight is MLG so that's

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.460 
minus sign the weight is MLG so that's
the<00:04:21.060> force<00:04:21.419> what<00:04:22.380> is<00:04:22.650> the<00:04:23.130> lever<00:04:23.460> arm

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
the force what is the lever arm

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:36.400 
the force what is the lever arm
well<00:04:25.630> the<00:04:26.630> lever<00:04:27.020> arm<00:04:27.380> is<00:04:29.860> this<00:04:35.020> okay<00:04:36.020> here's

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
well the lever arm is this okay here's

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:45.040 
well the lever arm is this okay here's
our<00:04:36.620> ladder<00:04:38.980> there<00:04:39.980> is<00:04:40.280> our<00:04:40.550> force<00:04:43.690> this<00:04:44.690> is

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
our ladder there is our force this is

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.480 
our ladder there is our force this is
the<00:04:45.200> lever<00:04:45.440> arm<00:04:45.710> for<00:04:45.860> that<00:04:46.130> guy<00:04:46.930> right<00:04:47.930> there

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
the lever arm for that guy right there

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.470 
the lever arm for that guy right there
and<00:04:50.350> this<00:04:51.350> side<00:04:51.740> of<00:04:52.070> the<00:04:52.190> triangle<00:04:52.490> is<00:04:53.030> in<00:04:53.240> fact

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
and this side of the triangle is in fact

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.900 
and this side of the triangle is in fact
L<00:04:53.750> over<00:04:54.050> 2<00:04:54.260> because<00:04:54.770> it's<00:04:55.040> a<00:04:55.160> uniform<00:04:55.640> ladder

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
L over 2 because it's a uniform ladder

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.690 
L over 2 because it's a uniform ladder
so<00:04:56.270> the<00:04:56.690> mass<00:04:56.900> is<00:04:57.290> acting<00:04:57.860> about<00:04:58.190> the<00:04:58.400> center

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
so the mass is acting about the center

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.900 
so the mass is acting about the center
of<00:04:58.820> mass<00:04:59.320> okay<00:05:00.320> so<00:05:00.650> this<00:05:00.980> becomes<00:05:01.490> L<00:05:02.390> over<00:05:03.290> 2

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
of mass okay so this becomes L over 2

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.990 
of mass okay so this becomes L over 2
times<00:05:04.960> cosine<00:05:05.960> theta<00:05:06.580> that's<00:05:07.580> what<00:05:07.880> this

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
times cosine theta that's what this

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.620 
times cosine theta that's what this
lever<00:05:08.330> arm<00:05:08.540> is<00:05:08.690> equal<00:05:09.020> to<00:05:10.210> good<00:05:11.210> what<00:05:11.600> about

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
lever arm is equal to good what about

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:17.020 
lever arm is equal to good what about
the<00:05:11.840> person<00:05:12.640> the<00:05:13.640> person<00:05:14.000> is<00:05:14.690> also<00:05:15.880> trying<00:05:16.880> to

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
the person the person is also trying to

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.270 
the person the person is also trying to
rotate<00:05:17.450> this<00:05:18.080> thing<00:05:18.140> in<00:05:18.650> the<00:05:18.800> clockwise

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
rotate this thing in the clockwise

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.080 
rotate this thing in the clockwise
direction

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
direction

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.650 
direction
what<00:05:20.810> is<00:05:20.960> the<00:05:21.170> lever<00:05:21.380> arm<00:05:21.620> for<00:05:21.980> the<00:05:22.070> person

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
what is the lever arm for the person

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.270 
what is the lever arm for the person
well<00:05:23.660> it's<00:05:23.960> the<00:05:24.050> same<00:05:24.320> idea<00:05:24.590> as<00:05:24.890> we<00:05:25.130> just

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
well it's the same idea as we just

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.150 
well it's the same idea as we just
talked<00:05:25.550> about<00:05:25.670> right<00:05:26.060> here<00:05:26.480> except<00:05:27.380> the

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
talked about right here except the

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.070 
talked about right here except the
distance<00:05:28.730> is<00:05:29.060> no<00:05:29.750> longer<00:05:30.050> L<00:05:30.380> over<00:05:30.680> 2<00:05:30.919> it<00:05:31.880> is<00:05:32.480> X

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
distance is no longer L over 2 it is X

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:39.280 
distance is no longer L over 2 it is X
and<00:05:33.800> so<00:05:34.640> this<00:05:35.120> becomes<00:05:35.690> X<00:05:37.240> cosine<00:05:38.240> of<00:05:38.660> theta

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.290 
and so this becomes X cosine of theta

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:45.610 
and so this becomes X cosine of theta
and<00:05:41.020> now<00:05:42.020> there<00:05:42.350> is<00:05:42.380> one<00:05:43.040> more<00:05:44.080> force<00:05:45.080> which<00:05:45.470> is

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
and now there is one more force which is

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.159 
and now there is one more force which is
giving<00:05:45.950> a<00:05:46.040> torque<00:05:46.400> and<00:05:46.669> that<00:05:46.910> is<00:05:47.090> the<00:05:47.240> push<00:05:47.570> P

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169 
giving a torque and that is the push P

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:52.210 
giving a torque and that is the push P
from<00:05:49.070> the<00:05:49.220> wall<00:05:49.430> and<00:05:49.760> the<00:05:50.690> push<00:05:50.990> P<00:05:51.380> from<00:05:52.070> the

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
from the wall and the push P from the

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:58.330 
from the wall and the push P from the
wall<00:05:52.960> is<00:05:53.960> up<00:05:54.350> at<00:05:54.500> the<00:05:54.530> top<00:05:54.800> of<00:05:54.980> the<00:05:55.040> ladder<00:05:57.340> so

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340 
wall is up at the top of the ladder so

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.030 
wall is up at the top of the ladder so
if<00:05:58.490> we<00:05:58.640> extend<00:05:58.970> that<00:05:59.270> force<00:05:59.660> line<00:05:59.960> that<00:06:00.740> is

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:01.040 
if we extend that force line that is

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.700 
if we extend that force line that is
push<00:06:01.400> P<00:06:01.790> what<00:06:02.660> is<00:06:02.690> the<00:06:02.960> lever<00:06:03.200> arm<00:06:03.380> in<00:06:03.590> that

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
push P what is the lever arm in that

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.110 
push P what is the lever arm in that
case<00:06:03.950> it's<00:06:04.430> that<00:06:04.970> right<00:06:05.540> there<00:06:06.730> this<00:06:07.730> was

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 
case it's that right there this was

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.320 
case it's that right there this was
theta<00:06:08.680> what<00:06:09.680> is<00:06:09.710> that<00:06:10.250> side<00:06:10.610> well<00:06:10.910> if<00:06:11.090> that's

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.330 
theta what is that side well if that's

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.800 
theta what is that side well if that's
Thea<00:06:11.870> then<00:06:12.440> this<00:06:12.860> is<00:06:13.100> Theta<00:06:13.460> the<00:06:14.390> length<00:06:14.720> here

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
Thea then this is Theta the length here

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.670 
Thea then this is Theta the length here
is<00:06:15.020> L<00:06:15.500> and<00:06:15.860> so<00:06:16.310> the<00:06:16.580> lever<00:06:16.880> arm<00:06:17.090> becomes<00:06:17.570> L<00:06:17.930> sine

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.680 
is L and so the lever arm becomes L sine

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.920 
is L and so the lever arm becomes L sine
theta<00:06:19.280> so<00:06:20.090> this<00:06:20.360> last<00:06:20.810> term<00:06:21.200> is<00:06:21.560> positive<00:06:22.930> P

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930 
theta so this last term is positive P

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:30.820 
theta so this last term is positive P
times<00:06:24.740> L<00:06:25.450> sine<00:06:26.450> theta<00:06:28.990> all<00:06:29.990> of<00:06:30.380> that<00:06:30.530> has<00:06:30.800> to

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:30.830 
times L sine theta all of that has to

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.670 
times L sine theta all of that has to
add<00:06:31.100> up<00:06:31.340> to<00:06:31.490> zero<00:06:31.790> because<00:06:32.510> it's<00:06:33.380> not<00:06:33.620> rotating

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 
add up to zero because it's not rotating

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.150 
add up to zero because it's not rotating
okay<00:06:35.310> and<00:06:35.790> now<00:06:36.509> look<00:06:36.780> you<00:06:36.930> have<00:06:37.160> three

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 
okay and now look you have three

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.999 
okay and now look you have three
equations<00:06:38.280> and<00:06:39.080> you<00:06:40.080> have<00:06:40.290> a<00:06:40.320> number<00:06:40.830> of

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:41.009 
equations and you have a number of

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:45.080 
equations and you have a number of
unknowns<00:06:41.840> there<00:06:42.840> is<00:06:43.050> in<00:06:43.199> fact<00:06:43.639> FS<00:06:44.639> which<00:06:44.940> is

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:45.090 
unknowns there is in fact FS which is

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.719 
unknowns there is in fact FS which is
unknown<00:06:45.449> P<00:06:45.960> which<00:06:46.229> is<00:06:46.410> unknown<00:06:46.770> and<00:06:47.130> is

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:47.729 
unknown P which is unknown and is

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:52.279 
unknown P which is unknown and is
unknown<00:06:48.210> and<00:06:48.539> X<00:06:49.380> which<00:06:49.919> is<00:06:50.130> unknown<00:06:50.699> and<00:06:51.000> so<00:06:51.960> we

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:52.289 
unknown and X which is unknown and so we

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:55.340 
unknown and X which is unknown and so we
need<00:06:52.500> in<00:06:52.710> fact<00:06:53.009> one<00:06:53.520> more<00:06:53.940> equation<00:06:54.330> to<00:06:55.020> make

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:55.350 
need in fact one more equation to make

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:59.120 
need in fact one more equation to make
this<00:06:55.590> work<00:06:55.919> and<00:06:56.220> it<00:06:57.090> is<00:06:57.270> of<00:06:57.449> course<00:06:57.479> the<00:06:58.470> static

00:06:59.120 --> 00:06:59.130 
this work and it is of course the static

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:02.060 
this work and it is of course the static
friction<00:06:59.880> equation<00:07:00.600> what's<00:07:01.320> the<00:07:01.530> biggest

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:02.070 
friction equation what's the biggest

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:06.560 
friction equation what's the biggest
that<00:07:02.490> static<00:07:03.090> friction<00:07:03.479> can<00:07:03.690> be<00:07:04.190> it's<00:07:05.190> F<00:07:05.729> sub<00:07:06.389> s

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:06.570 
that static friction can be it's F sub s

that static friction can be it's F sub s

00:07:11.719 --> 00:07:11.729 
equals mu s times N and now with those

00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:15.020 
equals mu s times N and now with those
four<00:07:12.000> equations<00:07:12.380> you<00:07:13.380> can<00:07:13.530> in<00:07:13.680> fact<00:07:13.919> solve<00:07:14.580> for

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:15.030 
four equations you can in fact solve for
