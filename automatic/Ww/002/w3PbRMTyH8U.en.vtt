00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:10.220
 I will explain to you today how to go about 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:13.250
 apply the almond oil inside 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:19.820
 a club was born in wood this 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:23.089
 procedure is considered very useful for i 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:26.089
 clarinets especially a little clarinets 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:27.980
 old people who have enough wood 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:29.779
 dry because in the colors in the new are 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.980
 already hated enough then now want 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:38.510
 with synthetic oils so they do not need 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:41.269
 of many of this many applications 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.149
 already a little that is not and then oiled 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:46.699
 I decided to give you some oil 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:50.480
 inside to brighten up a moment 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:54.410
 that particular sound a warm of the 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.059
 clarinet in this case I use oil of 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:00.469
 sweet almonds that are easily found 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:03.079
 in the pharmacy in these bottles there are 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:07.600
 50 ml bottles 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:11.470
 there are also 100 to 50 enough for 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.900
 three or four applications 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.460
 I've already used it on a couple of clarinets 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.390
 this will be the last two 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.189
 applications 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.970
 there are also how I told you these oils 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:27.170
 synthetic these of this marked 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:29.619
 found on music centers are very good 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:34.009
 because they last longer 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:36.409
 compared to those of sending classics 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:39.290
 that is, they do not become oil spills 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:43.119
 put off natural oil syndrome after a 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:48.500
 bit bad like olive oil 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:50.400
 obviously this obviously requires 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.780
 an application more 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.580
 gives greater ease of 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:00.970
 application having the spout as well 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:03.310
 obviously if you see the density is 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.790
 different from an oil of those who do 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.380
 apply in the keys for 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.300
 lubricate don't make the mistake of 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.420
 buy a wife like that where there is 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:17.260
 written special oil for food wings 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.150
 instrument with silicon free from cd 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.980
 etc. these are the ones to be deprived of 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.130
 on the wood 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.510
 they are not for the mechanical pearls 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.260
 we say otherwise go to seize 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.240
 all the banks said beyond the easy 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.920
 application and longer duration 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:42.160
 hello friends and to the greater duration of the 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:43.900
 of the oil itself also impregnating the 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.760
 wood itself these last much longer 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.860
 this dries a little 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.110
 these instead last longer 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.540
 wood protection and I will go to 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:56.350
 use this because it is more classic 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:59.140
 it also gives that aroma to wood 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.690
 of almond oil which is characteristic 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.120
 I have to finish some clarinets first 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.380
 to start using the other because 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.980
 otherwise as I said after a while the 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:12.370
 expires and goes wrong even if it expires in 2017 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.739
 but I will use it today as it is done 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.050
 then you first take the 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.910
 transparent film to protect the 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.190
 tampons are cut into slices of 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:25.239
 transparent film and thread 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:29.850
 under the tampons in this case in the 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:32.739
 tampons that stay open and better 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.110
 close it at the top so the 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:39.610
 film does not move also because then 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:41.560
 when i'm going to use the oil here 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.870
 do so close the 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.400
 buffer in fact a ride on so the 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.090
 protected buffer because once that 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.950
 I go 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.739
 inside then if it passes through i 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:54.250
 holes and wets the skin and vesicle 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:57.580
 tampons ruin the pads 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.320
 then apart from the cork pad e 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.960
 cork of the spokesman than in this 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.240
 case is in eva tex it is anyway 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:08.740
 sensitive god I will also protect this 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:10.330
 for safety, however, those in cork 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.740
 usually they do not have a spokesperson 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.160
 you need to be protected anyway 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.660
 close them all you never know 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:20.710
 then you take me now I'm done 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:25.420
 one a stem with a steel bar 

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:27.400
 with above the cotton soaks of 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.110
 almond oil obviously not 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.710
 burning it inside that there is one 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.470
 quintal 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:35.260
 you just need to get it dirty and go 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.600
 then to pass it on inside 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.990
 back until checking then 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:49.090
 looking inside the tube is not 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:51.250
 the is not the complete let 's say the 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:54.220
 full soaking of the whole of 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:57.730
 all wood walls and this is it 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:01.000
 all very simple though you have to with 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:03.910
 the experience understand how much I want 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.040
 put and what is enough because then 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.570
 you have to let it dry a little maybe 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.970
 make a second application later 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:13.600
 a few hours or maybe even the day 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:16.090
 then try the sound like like 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.340
 results after the first application 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.080
 and after the second application 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.290
 I always recommend it little by little 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:28.660
 because if you overdo it soaks too much into 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:30.370
 wood and it gets too wet 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.350
 you should then let it dry for me 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.720
 to be able to reuse it left 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:37.690
 dry maybe a week before 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.520
 have a decent sound if you don't have 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.410
 manual as I always write in 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.930
 disclaimer I know if you have no manual skills or 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.540
 you have no experience let it all do 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.290
 to an expert 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:51.420
 that 's all if you have any questions 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:51.420
 write me below the video
