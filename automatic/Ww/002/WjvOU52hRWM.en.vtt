00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:07.079 
with a spray wax to me this is the

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:09.050 
with a spray wax to me this is the
winning<00:01:07.320> combination<00:01:07.640> because<00:01:08.640> if<00:01:08.759> I'm<00:01:08.880> going

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
winning combination because if I'm going

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.609 
winning combination because if I'm going
to<00:01:09.149> go<00:01:09.299> through<00:01:09.509> the<00:01:09.600> trouble<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.140> apply

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
to go through the trouble to apply

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.069 
to go through the trouble to apply
something<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.369> might<00:01:12.030> as<00:01:12.180> well<00:01:12.240> have<00:01:12.570> some<00:01:12.780> wax

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:13.079 
something I might as well have some wax

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:16.940 
something I might as well have some wax
along<00:01:13.619> with<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.100> for<00:01:14.429> added<00:01:14.909> protection<00:01:15.950> even

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
along with it for added protection even

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.419 
along with it for added protection even
though<00:01:17.130> my<00:01:17.459> main<00:01:17.729> goal<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.920> appearance<00:01:19.920> so

00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:20.429 
though my main goal is appearance so

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:22.279 
though my main goal is appearance so
that's<00:01:20.700> where<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.179> comparison<00:01:21.659> really<00:01:22.170> is

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:22.289 
that's where the comparison really is

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:24.590 
that's where the comparison really is
really<00:01:22.950> lies<00:01:23.189> it's<00:01:23.639> about<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.149> user

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
really lies it's about the user

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.699 
really lies it's about the user
experience<00:01:25.429> so<00:01:26.429> to<00:01:26.459> me<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.539> wins<00:01:27.899> hands<00:01:28.499> down

00:01:28.699 --> 00:01:28.709 
experience so to me this wins hands down

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:32.330 
experience so to me this wins hands down
in<00:01:29.310> my<00:01:30.209> world<00:01:30.569> where<00:01:31.139> I'm<00:01:31.319> subject<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.189> the

00:01:45.769 --> 00:01:45.779 
create a link to both these so they will

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:47.449

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
pronouncing that incorrectly because I

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.589 
pronouncing that incorrectly because I
really<00:01:53.549> don't<00:01:53.639> even<00:01:53.880> know<00:01:54.029> and<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.329> really
