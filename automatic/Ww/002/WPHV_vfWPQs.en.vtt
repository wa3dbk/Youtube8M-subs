hi I'm Wendy from shiny happy world I've

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.780 
hi I'm Wendy from shiny happy world I've
done<00:00:03.570> a<00:00:03.600> video<00:00:03.780> showing<00:00:04.350> you<00:00:04.529> the<00:00:05.279> basic

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
done a video showing you the basic

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.419 
done a video showing you the basic
technique<00:00:05.819> for<00:00:06.480> an<00:00:06.870> easy<00:00:07.200> machine<00:00:07.560> appliqué

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
technique for an easy machine appliqué

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.910 
technique for an easy machine appliqué
the<00:00:09.269> video<00:00:09.750> that<00:00:09.960> I<00:00:09.990> did<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.410> introductory

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
the video that I did the introductory

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.339 
the video that I did the introductory
video<00:00:11.280> was<00:00:11.580> really<00:00:11.759> just<00:00:12.059> covering<00:00:12.570> how<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.080> do

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
video was really just covering how to do

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.829 
video was really just covering how to do
simple<00:00:13.889> convex<00:00:14.519> curves<00:00:14.940> what<00:00:15.570> I'm<00:00:15.660> going<00:00:15.809> to

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
simple convex curves what I'm going to

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.900 
simple convex curves what I'm going to
show<00:00:16.020> you<00:00:16.080> today<00:00:16.289> is<00:00:16.740> what<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.160> do<00:00:17.310> when<00:00:17.550> two<00:00:17.760> of

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
show you today is what to do when two of

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.330 
show you today is what to do when two of
those<00:00:18.090> convex<00:00:18.600> curves<00:00:18.900> come<00:00:19.170> together<00:00:19.380> into

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
those convex curves come together into

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.620 
those convex curves come together into
an<00:00:20.490> inside<00:00:21.000> point<00:00:21.510> it's<00:00:22.080> really<00:00:22.500> really<00:00:22.890> easy

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
an inside point it's really really easy

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.750 
an inside point it's really really easy
what<00:00:24.630> we<00:00:24.750> have<00:00:24.930> here<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.949> really<00:00:26.460> simple

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
what we have here is a really simple

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.820 
what we have here is a really simple
hippopotamus<00:00:27.660> face<00:00:27.900> for<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.230> quilt<00:00:28.470> block<00:00:28.650> that

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
hippopotamus face for a quilt block that

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.040 
hippopotamus face for a quilt block that
I'm<00:00:28.980> making<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:30.179> can<00:00:30.359> see<00:00:30.570> here<00:00:30.900> that

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
I'm making and you can see here that

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.380 
I'm making and you can see here that
I've<00:00:31.199> got<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.380> convex<00:00:31.980> curve<00:00:32.309> coming<00:00:32.730> in<00:00:32.969> here

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
I've got a convex curve coming in here

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.450 
I've got a convex curve coming in here
and<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.719> different<00:00:34.140> curve<00:00:34.350> coming<00:00:34.739> in<00:00:34.950> here<00:00:35.340> and

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
and a different curve coming in here and

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.910 
and a different curve coming in here and
they're<00:00:35.910> meeting<00:00:36.090> at<00:00:36.360> this<00:00:36.510> point<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.200> that's

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
they're meeting at this point and that's

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.410 
they're meeting at this point and that's
what<00:00:38.100> I'm<00:00:38.190> going<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.370> show<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.579> how<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:38.940> handle

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
what I'm going to show you how to handle

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.250 
what I'm going to show you how to handle
today<00:00:40.790> so<00:00:41.790> I'm<00:00:41.879> gonna<00:00:41.969> flip<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.390> over<00:00:42.540> I've<00:00:43.200> got

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
today so I'm gonna flip it over I've got

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.350 
today so I'm gonna flip it over I've got
the<00:00:43.590> freezer<00:00:43.829> paper<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.399> slides<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.180> back

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
the freezer paper it slides to the back

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.590 
the freezer paper it slides to the back
just<00:00:45.750> like<00:00:45.930> for<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.289> regular<00:00:46.649> technique<00:00:47.100> and

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
just like for the regular technique and

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.790 
just like for the regular technique and
you<00:00:48.600> can<00:00:48.780> see<00:00:48.960> where<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.200> problem<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.649> going

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
you can see where the problem is going

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.450 
you can see where the problem is going
to<00:00:49.860> be<00:00:49.950> we<00:00:50.670> wrap<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.210> excess<00:00:52.010> fabric<00:00:53.010> around

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
to be we wrap this excess fabric around

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.560 
to be we wrap this excess fabric around
and<00:00:54.120> it's<00:00:55.079> not<00:00:55.289> going<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.530> go<00:00:55.680> into<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.129> point

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
and it's not going to go into that point

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.299 
and it's not going to go into that point
so<00:00:57.570> it's<00:00:57.750> really<00:00:57.989> really<00:00:58.350> easy<00:00:58.379> what<00:00:59.039> we<00:00:59.129> need

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
so it's really really easy what we need

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.889 
so it's really really easy what we need
to<00:00:59.399> do<00:01:00.590> let<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.710> camera<00:01:02.070> zoom<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.750> we<00:01:03.750> just

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
to do let the camera zoom in we just

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.890 
to do let the camera zoom in we just
need<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.199> cut<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.379> snip<00:01:04.739> in<00:01:04.920> there<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:06.030> the

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
need to cut a snip in there and the

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.830 
need to cut a snip in there and the
trick<00:01:07.250> is<00:01:08.250> not<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.610> be<00:01:08.729> shy<00:01:08.970> about<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.360> you

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
trick is not to be shy about it you

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.200 
trick is not to be shy about it you
really<00:01:10.110> want<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.500> cut<00:01:10.710> right<00:01:11.159> up<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:11.850> edge

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
really want to cut right up to that edge

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.050 
really want to cut right up to that edge
maybe<00:01:12.630> leave<00:01:13.020> one<00:01:13.290> or<00:01:13.470> two<00:01:13.650> threads<00:01:13.920> there<00:01:14.310> but

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
maybe leave one or two threads there but

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.609 
maybe leave one or two threads there but
you<00:01:15.180> really<00:01:15.210> want<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.689> cut<00:01:15.840> right<00:01:15.869> up<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.470> it

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
you really want to cut right up to it

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.160 
you really want to cut right up to it
because<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:17.009> need<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.750> fabric<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.930> be<00:01:19.049> able

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
because you need that fabric to be able

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.280 
because you need that fabric to be able
to<00:01:19.320> spread<00:01:19.770> out<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.580> it'll<00:01:20.820> go<00:01:20.970> right<00:01:21.330> into<00:01:21.659> the

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
to spread out so it'll go right into the

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.560 
to spread out so it'll go right into the
point<00:01:22.560> from<00:01:22.830> both<00:01:23.100> directions<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.420> is

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
point from both directions and this is

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.390 
point from both directions and this is
the<00:01:24.689> problem<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.170> most<00:01:25.409> beginners<00:01:25.950> have<00:01:26.159> is

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
the problem that most beginners have is

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.649 
the problem that most beginners have is
they're<00:01:26.610> really<00:01:26.880> nervous<00:01:27.090> about<00:01:27.330> cutting

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
they're really nervous about cutting

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.359 
they're really nervous about cutting
right<00:01:27.990> up<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.560> edge<00:01:28.680> because<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.100> don't

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
right up to the edge because you don't

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.670 
right up to the edge because you don't
want<00:01:29.520> any<00:01:29.670> fraying<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.150> happen<00:01:30.479> don't<00:01:31.170> be<00:01:31.409> shy

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
want any fraying to happen don't be shy

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.819 
want any fraying to happen don't be shy
just<00:01:32.070> snip<00:01:32.970> right<00:01:33.180> in<00:01:33.390> there<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.869> then<00:01:34.560> let<00:01:34.740> me

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
just snip right in there and then let me

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:45.380 
just snip right in there and then let me
show<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:35.070> well<00:01:35.369> press<00:01:35.610> that

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.150 

do<00:01:46.390> the<00:01:46.510> rest<00:01:46.690> of<00:01:46.870> that<00:01:46.960> when<00:01:47.680> I'm<00:01:47.800> not<00:01:47.890> worried

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
do the rest of that when I'm not worried

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.380 
do the rest of that when I'm not worried
about<00:01:48.250> getting<00:01:48.490> in<00:01:48.730> front<00:01:48.880> of<00:01:48.970> the<00:01:49.030> camera

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
about getting in front of the camera

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.880 
about getting in front of the camera
then<00:01:49.660> I<00:01:49.720> can<00:01:49.870> flip<00:01:50.140> this<00:01:50.290> over<00:01:50.530> now<00:01:50.830> and<00:01:51.130> show

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
then I can flip this over now and show

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.920 
then I can flip this over now and show
that<00:01:53.890> point<00:01:54.190> to<00:01:54.340> you<00:01:54.460> if<00:01:55.390> you're<00:01:55.660> really

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
that point to you if you're really

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.260 
that point to you if you're really
worried<00:01:56.500> about<00:01:56.800> any<00:01:57.100> fraying<00:01:57.520> happening<00:01:58.150> at

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
worried about any fraying happening at

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.180
