 I have to tell you something and I have them 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.910
 to say well sincere as always 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.440
 he said as far as rebels you do not have 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:52.270
 but they are looking for you 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:54.310
 the grouping of mere mere and how 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.760
 it comes off but they make a new one 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.370
 New concept 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:06.739
 what comes back we know what 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:11.879
 happened with the word exactly right 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:14.730
 the new projects new things in the 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:18.900
 horizon wanted to do their project 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.159
 new and I do have to tell you something myself 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.110
 I was not fortunate to have them 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:25.620
 listened to I get along very well with the 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:28.200
 of the currency and I take my channel macario 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.379
 they leave chava edita there are people from the 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.359
 melamine that rise in this cluster 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:35.190
 but just as I gave him the opportunity 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:36.989
 to do an interview when it happened 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:44.299
 the whole problem and so we can call it 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:44.299
 for me not because of problems in total 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.290
 unfortunately fortunately 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:59.650
 in that time of the post but look I have 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:03.980
 understood but he 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:08.110
 good compensation became independent 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.110
 band has in project 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:30.520
 this wait and they are very similar 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.190
 also for this language 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:50.150
 so 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:52.640
 raises his project and is totally 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:58.300
 different there are no problems just was 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:58.300
 a feeling still exists 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:07.670
 that's good, it's already more than explained 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.200
 what happened with both the buccaneer in 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.600
 this case a new project of the mere 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.030
 mera the great one of mexico and then we are going 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.760
 Now, what you need is that 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:19.160
 truth is already what happened back if 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:22.220
 we do not care with all respect for the 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.410
 search for mexico we enter the 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.230
 interview in their space and in 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.710
 this compadrito case we can finish in 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.710
 the disc 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:35.180
 it's the first time they do not usually live 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.250
 already as I had communicated it has been seen 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.140
 initiated on youtube had seen us in 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.640

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.340
