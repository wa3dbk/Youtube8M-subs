00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
figure out of its packaging very very

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.460 
figure out of its packaging very very
nice<00:00:06.089> figure<00:00:06.330> let's<00:00:06.779> first<00:00:07.020> have<00:00:07.140> a<00:00:07.200> look<00:00:07.259> at

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
nice figure let's first have a look at

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.740 
nice figure let's first have a look at
the<00:00:07.589> accessories<00:00:09.349> you<00:00:10.349> get<00:00:10.500> your<00:00:11.750> backpack

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
the accessories you get your backpack

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.169 
the accessories you get your backpack
your<00:00:12.990> water<00:00:13.320> backpack<00:00:13.980> I<00:00:14.219> guess<00:00:14.580> that's<00:00:14.849> I

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
your water backpack I guess that's I

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.460 
your water backpack I guess that's I
think<00:00:15.929> that's<00:00:16.080> what<00:00:16.230> we've<00:00:16.350> decided<00:00:16.650> it<00:00:16.949> is

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
think that's what we've decided it is

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.349 
think that's what we've decided it is
also<00:00:19.470> comes<00:00:19.650> with<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.859> missile<00:00:20.400> if<00:00:20.550> you<00:00:21.210> can

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
also comes with a missile if you can

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.750 
also comes with a missile if you can
call<00:00:21.570> it<00:00:21.720> that<00:00:21.980> it's<00:00:22.980> actually<00:00:23.160> very<00:00:23.369> similar

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
call it that it's actually very similar

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.460 
call it that it's actually very similar
to<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.900> electro<00:00:25.849> figure<00:00:26.849> he's<00:00:27.359> got<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.570> which

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
to the electro figure he's got a which

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.259 
to the electro figure he's got a which
I'm<00:00:28.590> actually<00:00:28.710> going<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.039> review<00:00:29.340> on<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.939> later

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
I'm actually going to review on a later

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.900 
I'm actually going to review on a later
date<00:00:30.539> but<00:00:30.779> he's<00:00:31.019> got<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.679> same<00:00:31.980> similar<00:00:32.489> idea

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
date but he's got the same similar idea

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.229 
date but he's got the same similar idea
it<00:00:33.180> as<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.350> see<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.890> doesn't<00:00:35.640> actually<00:00:35.760> lock

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
it as you see it doesn't actually lock

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.610 
it as you see it doesn't actually lock
in<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.260> cannon<00:00:38.210> it's<00:00:39.210> actually

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
in to the cannon it's actually

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.139 
in to the cannon it's actually
pressure-sensitive<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.670> idea<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.000> you

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
pressure-sensitive so the idea is you

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.389 
pressure-sensitive so the idea is you
you<00:00:42.420> push<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.899> missile<00:00:43.200> in<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.620> then<00:00:44.190> when

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
you push the missile in and then when

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.069 
you push the missile in and then when
you<00:00:44.489> let<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.730> go<00:00:44.850> it'll<00:00:45.570> fire<00:00:45.899> off<00:00:46.399> I<00:00:48.079> mean

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
you let it go it'll fire off I mean

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.869 
you let it go it'll fire off I mean
obviously<00:00:49.670> by<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.730> figure<00:00:51.030> for<00:00:51.210> this<00:00:52.520> yeah<00:00:53.520> so

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
obviously by the figure for this yeah so

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.619 
obviously by the figure for this yeah so
we'll<00:00:54.510> put<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:54.809> guy<00:00:54.899> aside<00:00:55.550> and<00:00:56.550> we'll<00:00:57.449> just

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
we'll put this guy aside and we'll just

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.720 
we'll put this guy aside and we'll just
forget<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.079> that's<00:00:58.320> there<00:00:58.590> looking<00:00:59.430> at<00:00:59.550> the

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
forget that that's there looking at the

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.110

if you notice right here base compared

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.789 
if you notice right here base compared
to<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.790> comics<00:01:33.299> he's<00:01:33.990> got<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.200> very<00:01:34.380> tight

webbing in the comics spectacular
spider-man<00:01:37.680> because<00:01:37.979> they're<00:01:38.280> more<00:01:38.400> stylized

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
spider-man because they're more stylized

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.120

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
and design they spread the web out which

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.580 
and design they spread the web out which
I<00:01:44.340> think<00:01:44.549> actually<00:01:44.670> as<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.210> figure<00:01:45.689> looks<00:01:45.960> just

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
I think actually as a figure looks just

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.490 
I think actually as a figure looks just
unbelievable<00:01:49.700> also<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:51.149> head<00:01:51.500> very

is this one they seem to it must have
been<00:02:28.870> early<00:02:29.080> designs<00:02:29.710> before<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:30.250> show<00:02:30.430> had

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
been early designs before the show had

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.010 
been early designs before the show had
come<00:02:30.850> out<00:02:31.030> that's<00:02:31.420> usually<00:02:31.630> what<00:02:31.870> they<00:02:31.960> do

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
come out that's usually what they do

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.420 
come out that's usually what they do
with<00:02:32.200> a<00:02:32.260> lot<00:02:32.350> of<00:02:32.440> these<00:02:32.530> cartoons<00:02:32.920> is<00:02:33.250> they

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
with a lot of these cartoons is they

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.300 
with a lot of these cartoons is they
they<00:02:33.700> have<00:02:34.470> prototype<00:02:35.470> designs<00:02:35.920> for<00:02:36.220> these

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
they have prototype designs for these

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.410 
they have prototype designs for these
characters<00:02:38.310> based<00:02:39.310> on<00:02:39.490> those<00:02:39.580> designs<00:02:40.000> they

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
characters based on those designs they

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.880 
characters based on those designs they
probably<00:02:41.760> made<00:02:42.760> these<00:02:42.970> toys<00:02:43.300> ahead<00:02:43.780> of<00:02:43.960> the

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
probably made these toys ahead of the

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.770 
probably made these toys ahead of the
show<00:02:45.280> actually<00:02:45.520> coming<00:02:46.090> out<00:02:46.240> as<00:02:47.050> a<00:02:47.110> result<00:02:48.780> the

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
show actually coming out as a result the

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.680 
show actually coming out as a result the
sorry<00:02:50.560> book<00:02:51.220> bump<00:02:51.490> the<00:02:51.580> camera<00:02:51.730> there<00:02:52.030> as<00:02:52.150> a

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
sorry book bump the camera there as a

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.880 
sorry book bump the camera there as a
result<00:02:53.020> you'll<00:02:53.230> notice<00:02:53.500> that<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:54.390> spider

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
result you'll notice that the spider

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.640 
result you'll notice that the spider
symbol<00:02:56.890> is<00:02:57.210> more<00:02:58.210> accurate<00:02:58.960> I<00:02:59.110> guess<00:02:59.320> to<00:02:59.620> the

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
symbol is more accurate I guess to the

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.240 
symbol is more accurate I guess to the
movie<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:01.480> webbing<00:03:01.870> is<00:03:02.050> a<00:03:02.080> lot<00:03:02.350> tighter<00:03:02.620> it's

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
movie the webbing is a lot tighter it's

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.780 
movie the webbing is a lot tighter it's
a<00:03:03.370> lot<00:03:03.550> a<00:03:03.580> lot<00:03:04.090> more<00:03:04.270> closer<00:03:04.720> knit<00:03:05.580> same<00:03:06.580> thing

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
a lot a lot more closer knit same thing

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.229 
a lot a lot more closer knit same thing
with<00:03:06.940> the<00:03:07.030> feet<00:03:07.240> here<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:07.660> boots

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
with the feet here the boots

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:14.580 
with the feet here the boots
closer<00:03:10.239> knit<00:03:12.630> one<00:03:13.630> other<00:03:13.870> thing<00:03:14.080> too<00:03:14.260> is<00:03:14.290> if

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
closer knit one other thing too is if

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.490 
closer knit one other thing too is if
you<00:03:14.709> if<00:03:15.010> you're<00:03:15.250> big<00:03:15.850> fan<00:03:16.060> of<00:03:16.090> the<00:03:16.300> show<00:03:16.989> the

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
you if you're big fan of the show the

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.530 
you if you're big fan of the show the
cartoon<00:03:17.920> like<00:03:18.760> his<00:03:19.480> head<00:03:20.640> like<00:03:21.640> what<00:03:22.239> is<00:03:22.360> that

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
cartoon like his head like what is that

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.520 
cartoon like his head like what is that
I<00:03:22.860> mean<00:03:23.860> if<00:03:24.010> you<00:03:24.040> compare<00:03:24.220> it<00:03:24.489> to<00:03:25.080> the<00:03:26.080> wave<00:03:26.260> for

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
I mean if you compare it to the wave for

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.050 
I mean if you compare it to the wave for
spider-man<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:28.840> wave<00:03:29.020> for<00:03:29.320> spider-man<00:03:29.800> has<00:03:30.550> a

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
spider-man the wave for spider-man has a

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.210 
spider-man the wave for spider-man has a
show-accurate<00:03:31.900> head<00:03:32.380> whereas<00:03:32.920> this<00:03:33.070> one

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
show-accurate head whereas this one

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.900 
show-accurate head whereas this one
right<00:03:33.340> here

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
right here

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.170 
right here
his<00:03:34.630> eyes<00:03:34.840> are<00:03:35.110> off<00:03:35.290> as<00:03:35.590> well<00:03:36.400> as<00:03:36.580> he's<00:03:36.760> kind<00:03:37.090> of

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
his eyes are off as well as he's kind of

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.140 
his eyes are off as well as he's kind of
got<00:03:38.070> I'm<00:03:39.070> going<00:03:39.250> to<00:03:39.310> say<00:03:39.489> an<00:03:39.610> inverted

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
got I'm going to say an inverted

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.890 
got I'm going to say an inverted
pear-shape<00:03:40.810> head<00:03:41.970> one<00:03:42.970> of<00:03:43.000> other<00:03:43.360> thing<00:03:43.690> too

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
pear-shape head one of other thing too

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.000 
pear-shape head one of other thing too
is<00:03:43.930> the<00:03:44.320> fact<00:03:44.470> that<00:03:44.680> if<00:03:46.200> they've<00:03:47.200> they've

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
is the fact that if they've they've

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.280 
is the fact that if they've they've
proportioned<00:03:49.000> this<00:03:49.570> one<00:03:49.810> a<00:03:49.840> little<00:03:50.080> bit

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
proportioned this one a little bit

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:57.170 
proportioned this one a little bit
different<00:03:51.060> for<00:03:52.060> example<00:03:52.180> like<00:03:54.090> his<00:03:55.090> torso<00:03:55.950> his

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
different for example like his torso his

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.080 
different for example like his torso his
torso<00:03:58.180> right<00:03:58.720> here<00:03:59.260> the<00:04:00.010> ball<00:04:00.250> joint<00:04:00.760> is

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
torso right here the ball joint is

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.229 
torso right here the ball joint is
actually<00:04:01.959> right<00:04:02.320> right<00:04:03.160> below<00:04:03.580> his<00:04:03.910> his

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
actually right right below his his

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.110 
actually right right below his his
pectoral<00:04:05.050> er<00:04:05.220> that's<00:04:06.220> kind<00:04:06.519> of<00:04:06.550> sounds<00:04:06.790> gay

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
pectoral er that's kind of sounds gay

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.600 
pectoral er that's kind of sounds gay
right<00:04:07.420> under<00:04:07.690> his<00:04:07.900> his<00:04:08.500> chest<00:04:08.890> here<00:04:09.130> whereas

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
right under his his chest here whereas

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.560 
right under his his chest here whereas
if<00:04:09.700> we<00:04:09.760> look<00:04:10.060> at<00:04:10.209> this<00:04:10.810> one<00:04:11.940> the<00:04:12.940> ball<00:04:13.090> joint<00:04:13.450> is

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
if we look at this one the ball joint is

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.479 
if we look at this one the ball joint is
actually<00:04:13.930> in<00:04:14.110> mid<00:04:14.590> stomach<00:04:15.130> like<00:04:15.520> mid<00:04:15.820> torso

actually in mid stomach like mid torso

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:23.659 
actually in mid stomach like mid torso
um<00:04:18.259> yeah<00:04:19.259> so<00:04:20.930> all<00:04:21.930> right<00:04:22.049> so<00:04:22.259> look<00:04:22.500> there<00:04:22.740> turn

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
um yeah so all right so look there turn

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.770 
um yeah so all right so look there turn
them<00:04:23.789> sideways<00:04:24.000> here<00:04:26.030> and<00:04:27.030> turn<00:04:27.660> them

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
them sideways here and turn them

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.150 
them sideways here and turn them
sideways<00:04:27.960> here<00:04:29.150> also<00:04:30.150> to<00:04:30.770> the<00:04:31.770> wave<00:04:31.919> one

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
sideways here also to the wave one

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.409 
sideways here also to the wave one
spider-man<00:04:33.620> one<00:04:34.620> hand<00:04:34.979> is<00:04:35.190> in<00:04:35.550> the<00:04:35.729> shooting

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
spider-man one hand is in the shooting

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:42.290 
spider-man one hand is in the shooting
web<00:04:36.919> I<00:04:38.300> guess<00:04:39.300> position<00:04:39.780> the<00:04:40.590> other<00:04:40.620> hand<00:04:41.300> is

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
web I guess position the other hand is

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:48.760 
web I guess position the other hand is
open<00:04:43.550> like<00:04:44.550> so<00:04:45.500> if<00:04:46.500> you<00:04:46.560> compare<00:04:47.009> that<00:04:47.190> to<00:04:47.330> the

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
open like so if you compare that to the

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.540 
open like so if you compare that to the
wave<00:04:49.770> for<00:04:50.069> spider-man<00:04:51.620> the<00:04:52.620> opposite<00:04:53.069> hand<00:04:53.310> is

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
wave for spider-man the opposite hand is

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.670 
wave for spider-man the opposite hand is
in<00:04:54.000> the<00:04:54.599> spider<00:04:55.380> web<00:04:56.090> pose<00:04:57.199> or<00:04:58.199> the<00:04:58.349> shooting

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
in the spider web pose or the shooting

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.960 
in the spider web pose or the shooting
web<00:04:58.860> pose<00:04:59.130> and<00:04:59.460> this<00:05:00.419> hand<00:05:00.750> is<00:05:00.990> is<00:05:01.669> the<00:05:02.669> open

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
web pose and this hand is is the open

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:09.249 
web pose and this hand is is the open
hand<00:05:04.759> even<00:05:05.759> if<00:05:05.970> you<00:05:06.389> compare<00:05:06.750> the<00:05:06.870> two<00:05:07.050> here

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:09.259 
hand even if you compare the two here

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:11.629 
hand even if you compare the two here
they<00:05:10.259> then<00:05:10.500> they've<00:05:10.740> flipped<00:05:11.190> the<00:05:11.400> hand

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639 
they then they've flipped the hand

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.360 
they then they've flipped the hand
around<00:05:11.940> and<00:05:12.240> this<00:05:12.750> one<00:05:12.930> actually<00:05:13.050> still<00:05:13.530> has

an open hand to hold stuff despite the

an open hand to hold stuff despite the
