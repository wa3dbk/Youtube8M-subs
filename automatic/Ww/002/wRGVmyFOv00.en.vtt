history is really quickly like their
model<00:02:25.110> family<00:02:25.500> if<00:02:26.010> they<00:02:26.070> were<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.460> be

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
model family if they were to be

model family if they were to be
introduced<00:02:27.180> they<00:02:27.330> should<00:02:27.510> not<00:02:27.690> be<00:02:27.900> introduced

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
introduced they should not be introduced

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.680 
introduced they should not be introduced
this<00:02:28.620> quickly<00:02:29.010> in<00:02:29.370> my<00:02:29.430> opinion<00:02:30.270> well<00:02:30.510> this<00:02:30.660> is

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
this quickly in my opinion well this is

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.220 
this quickly in my opinion well this is
way<00:02:31.020> too<00:02:31.050> soon<00:02:32.060> so<00:02:33.060> I'm<00:02:33.240> glad<00:02:33.360> ended<00:02:33.900> up<00:02:33.990> being

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
way too soon so I'm glad ended up being

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.830 
way too soon so I'm glad ended up being
a<00:02:34.320> temporary<00:02:34.890> thing<00:02:35.010> that<00:02:36.000> you<00:02:36.450> know<00:02:36.570> Billy

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
a temporary thing that you know Billy

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.870 
a temporary thing that you know Billy
just<00:02:37.110> was<00:02:37.860> able<00:02:38.070> to<00:02:38.130> temporarily<00:02:38.310> given

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
just was able to temporarily given

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.930 
just was able to temporarily given
powers<00:02:39.210> because<00:02:39.570> I<00:02:39.840> think<00:02:40.530> Fred<00:02:41.370> new<00:02:41.490> 52

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
powers because I think Fred new 52

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.480 
powers because I think Fred new 52
Shazam<00:02:42.480> should<00:02:42.720> be<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.020> only<00:02:43.370> quote<00:02:44.370> unquote

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
Shazam should be the only quote unquote

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.830 
Shazam should be the only quote unquote
Shazam<00:02:45.330> so<00:02:46.020> there's<00:02:46.830> that<00:02:46.890> and<00:02:47.550> they<00:02:48.450> all<00:02:48.570> kind

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
Shazam so there's that and they all kind

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.390 
Shazam so there's that and they all kind
of<00:02:48.960> attack<00:02:49.290> black<00:02:49.530> adam<00:02:49.800> and<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.190> fight

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
of attack black adam and the fight

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.020 
of attack black adam and the fight
happens<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.210> as<00:02:51.420> you<00:02:51.690> can<00:02:51.840> guess<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:53.000> lot<00:02:54.000> of

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
happens and as you can guess a lot of

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.060 
happens and as you can guess a lot of
chaos<00:02:54.300> occurs<00:02:54.990> and<00:02:55.380> without<00:02:55.560> giving<00:02:55.890> too<00:02:55.920> much

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
chaos occurs and without giving too much

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.490 
chaos occurs and without giving too much
away<00:02:56.270> they<00:02:57.270> eventually<00:02:57.570> lose<00:02:58.290> their

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
away they eventually lose their

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.350 
away they eventually lose their
abilities<00:02:58.920> because<00:02:59.190> it's<00:02:59.640> temporary<00:03:00.270> and

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
abilities because it's temporary and

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.590 
abilities because it's temporary and
billy<00:03:00.630> is<00:03:00.840> still<00:03:01.710> experienced<00:03:02.610> as<00:03:02.730> Shazam<00:03:03.270> so

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
billy is still experienced as Shazam so

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.680 
billy is still experienced as Shazam so
he<00:03:03.750> doesn't<00:03:03.870> exactly<00:03:04.200> know<00:03:04.620> how<00:03:04.650> to<00:03:04.950> I<00:03:05.690> guess

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
he doesn't exactly know how to I guess

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.300 
he doesn't exactly know how to I guess

turn makes him rapidly age and black and

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.500 
turn makes him rapidly age and black and
turns<00:03:25.620> in<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:25.800> dust<00:03:26.130> so<00:03:26.940> that<00:03:27.060> kind<00:03:27.150> of<00:03:27.239> sucks

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
turns in the dust so that kind of sucks

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.580 
turns in the dust so that kind of sucks
for<00:03:27.690> him<00:03:27.810> but<00:03:28.140> Billy<00:03:28.680> uses<00:03:29.580> that<00:03:29.730> chance<00:03:30.090> to

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
for him but Billy uses that chance to

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.229 
for him but Billy uses that chance to
just<00:03:31.590> make<00:03:32.160> everything<00:03:32.430> right<00:03:32.850> again<00:03:32.910> it's

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
just make everything right again it's

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:34.729 
just make everything right again it's
ever<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.480> seven<00:03:33.750> deadly<00:03:33.840> sins<00:03:34.140> run<00:03:34.380> away<00:03:34.680> so

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
ever the seven deadly sins run away so

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.340 
ever the seven deadly sins run away so
he<00:03:35.250> doesn't<00:03:35.370> really<00:03:35.580> fixed<00:03:36.090> that<00:03:36.270> problem<00:03:36.350> so

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
he doesn't really fixed that problem so

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.560 
he doesn't really fixed that problem so
I'm<00:03:37.440> guessing<00:03:37.680> that<00:03:37.830> we'll<00:03:38.010> come<00:03:38.190> back<00:03:38.340> later

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
I'm guessing that we'll come back later

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.270 
I'm guessing that we'll come back later
maybe<00:03:39.570> they'll<00:03:39.840> go<00:03:40.140> into<00:03:40.380> the<00:03:40.680> whole<00:03:40.860> trainee

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
maybe they'll go into the whole trainee

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.040 
maybe they'll go into the whole trainee
war<00:03:41.550> coming<00:03:41.790> up<00:03:41.970> since<00:03:42.300> they<00:03:42.420> are<00:03:42.570> the<00:03:42.720> seven

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
Shazam is not Captain Marvel and by that

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.690 
Shazam is not Captain Marvel and by that
I<00:05:01.110> mean<00:05:01.380> captain<00:05:01.650> Rommel<00:05:02.070> got<00:05:02.220> his<00:05:02.340> powers

I mean captain Rommel got his powers

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.340 
I mean captain Rommel got his powers
from<00:05:02.940> God's<00:05:03.389> like<00:05:04.190> Hercules<00:05:05.720> atlas<00:05:06.720> arounds

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
from God's like Hercules atlas arounds

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.440 
from God's like Hercules atlas arounds
atlases<00:05:07.950> Titan<00:05:08.370> but<00:05:08.490> like<00:05:08.669> Susan<00:05:09.150> you<00:05:09.330> know

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450

hopefully<00:05:10.260> you<00:05:10.470> guys<00:05:10.530> understand<00:05:10.979> what<00:05:11.070> I<00:05:11.100> was

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
hopefully you guys understand what I was

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.440 
hopefully you guys understand what I was
saying<00:05:11.250> he<00:05:12.180> he's<00:05:12.630> not<00:05:12.660> empowered<00:05:13.470> by<00:05:13.680> god's<00:05:14.070> or

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
saying he he's not empowered by god's or

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:18.350 
saying he he's not empowered by god's or
biblical<00:05:15.450> figures<00:05:16.080> anymore<00:05:16.800> his<00:05:17.520> powers<00:05:18.090> come

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
biblical figures anymore his powers come

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.379 
biblical figures anymore his powers come
just<00:05:18.690> from<00:05:18.810> magic<00:05:19.680> in<00:05:19.830> general<00:05:20.100> which<00:05:20.430> really

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389 
just from magic in general which really

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:23.600 
just from magic in general which really
I<00:05:21.510> think<00:05:21.600> takes<00:05:21.990> away<00:05:22.229> uniqueness<00:05:22.740> of<00:05:23.070> him<00:05:23.400> to

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
I think takes away uniqueness of him to

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.760 
I think takes away uniqueness of him to
a<00:05:23.639> degree<00:05:23.820> cuz<00:05:24.210> he's<00:05:24.360> basically<00:05:24.720> like<00:05:25.050> I<00:05:25.530> kind

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
a degree cuz he's basically like I kind

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.860 
a degree cuz he's basically like I kind
of<00:05:25.800> said<00:05:26.010> a<00:05:26.250> while<00:05:26.520> while<00:05:27.030> ago<00:05:27.240> magical

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
of said a while while ago magical

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.650 
of said a while while ago magical
Superman<00:05:28.350> which<00:05:28.650> a<00:05:28.770> lot<00:05:28.950> of<00:05:28.979> times<00:05:29.250> is<00:05:29.520> a<00:05:30.090> disc

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
Superman which a lot of times is a disc

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.830 
Superman which a lot of times is a disc
given<00:05:31.140> to<00:05:31.520> Captain<00:05:32.520> Marvel<00:05:32.910> by<00:05:33.510> a<00:05:33.539> lot<00:05:33.750> of

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
given to Captain Marvel by a lot of

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:34.880 
given to Captain Marvel by a lot of
pants<00:05:34.110> that<00:05:34.140> don't<00:05:34.229> understand<00:05:34.800> the

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:34.890 
pants that don't understand the

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.210 
pants that don't understand the
character<00:05:35.280> so<00:05:35.460> I<00:05:35.490> really<00:05:36.060> wish<00:05:36.300> they<00:05:36.720> had<00:05:37.220> not

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
character so I really wish they had not

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.620 
character so I really wish they had not
taken<00:05:38.820> that<00:05:39.060> away<00:05:39.180> but<00:05:39.630> I<00:05:39.840> guess<00:05:40.620> that's<00:05:41.630> their

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
taken that away but I guess that's their

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.140 
taken that away but I guess that's their
way<00:05:42.840> of<00:05:42.870> differentiating<00:05:43.789> Captain<00:05:44.789> Marvel

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
way of differentiating Captain Marvel

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.800 
way of differentiating Captain Marvel
and<00:05:45.350> Shazam<00:05:46.350> so<00:05:46.650> that<00:05:47.370> stinks<00:05:47.789> but<00:05:47.970> all<00:05:48.300> in<00:05:48.720> all

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
and Shazam so that stinks but all in all

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.719 
and Shazam so that stinks but all in all
