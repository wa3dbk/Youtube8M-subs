so far and now that i can finally be in

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.060 
so far and now that i can finally be in
this<00:00:21.300> thing<00:00:24.050> of<00:00:25.050> course<00:00:25.439> I'm<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.680> little<00:00:25.949> bit

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
this thing of course I'm a little bit

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.089 
this thing of course I'm a little bit
afraid<00:00:26.220> but<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.970> choose<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:27.570> myself<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.260> could

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
afraid but I choose it myself I could

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.110 
afraid but I choose it myself I could
say<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.519> could<00:00:30.000> stay<00:00:30.210> in<00:00:30.390> cyclocross<00:00:31.050> but<00:00:32.120> my

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
say I could stay in cyclocross but my

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.540 
say I could stay in cyclocross but my
ambitious<00:00:33.690> in<00:00:33.899> my<00:00:34.140> career<00:00:34.440> are<00:00:34.739> much<00:00:35.280> higher<00:00:35.489> a

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
ambitious in my career are much higher a

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.690 
ambitious in my career are much higher a
cyclocross<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.630> I<00:00:37.559> never<00:00:38.070> want<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.520> stop

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
cyclocross and I never want to stop

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.639 
cyclocross and I never want to stop
actually<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.480> career<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.079> say<00:00:40.260> oh<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.440> never

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
actually the career and say oh I never

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.970 
actually the career and say oh I never
try<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.430> real<00:00:41.969> professional<00:00:42.809> road<00:00:43.410> career<00:00:43.800> and

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
i think i will be real disappointed when

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.160 
i think i will be real disappointed when
I<00:00:47.010> didn't<00:00:47.730> write<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.329> weed<00:00:48.989> is<00:00:49.140> really

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
I didn't write and weed is really

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.770 
I didn't write and weed is really
everything<00:00:49.559> for<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.309> step<00:00:50.910> in<00:00:51.090> this<00:00:51.210> team<00:00:51.480> and

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.310 

its<00:00:54.780> really<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.440> will<00:00:55.649> be<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:56.190> big<00:00:57.030> step<00:00:57.300> but<00:00:57.539> i

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
its really it will be a big step but i

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.000 
its really it will be a big step but i
hope<00:00:58.949> i<00:00:59.100> will<00:00:59.280> be<00:00:59.430> ready<00:00:59.670> I<00:01:03.320> really<00:01:04.320> love<00:01:04.500> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
hope i will be ready I really love the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.690 
hope i will be ready I really love the
classics<00:01:05.460> but<00:01:06.470> it's<00:01:07.470> very<00:01:07.830> difficult<00:01:08.100> for<00:01:08.400> to

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
classics but it's very difficult for to

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.690 
classics but it's very difficult for to
say<00:01:08.970> I<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:09.840> advance<00:01:10.229> something<00:01:10.710> because<00:01:11.070> it's

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
say I in advance something because it's

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.270 
say I in advance something because it's
something<00:01:12.510> else<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:13.049> dream<00:01:13.619> about<00:01:13.830> something

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
something else to dream about something

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.899 
something else to dream about something
before<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.880> try<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:16.250> so<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.280> want<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.700> first

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
before you try and so I want to first

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.910 
before you try and so I want to first
really<00:01:18.150> try<00:01:18.509> all<00:01:18.540> those<00:01:19.020> races<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.740> then

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
really try all those races and then

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.910 
really try all those races and then
really<00:01:20.400> say<00:01:20.580> okay<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:21.119> think<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.720> this<00:01:22.350> can<00:01:22.740> be

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
really say okay I think that this can be

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.660 
really say okay I think that this can be
really<00:01:23.159> my<00:01:23.570> strong<00:01:24.570> side<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:25.320> me<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.740> now<00:01:26.369> that

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
really my strong side of me and now that

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.740 
really my strong side of me and now that
I<00:01:26.820> can<00:01:27.060> go<00:01:27.210> really<00:01:27.450> for<00:01:27.780> those<00:01:27.990> kind<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.439> racist

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.630 

sure<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:33.780> want<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.409> stay<00:01:34.619> in<00:01:34.649> cyclocross<00:01:35.310> but

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
sure I want to stay in cyclocross but

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.429 
sure I want to stay in cyclocross but
they<00:01:35.820> are<00:01:35.939> probably<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.450> will<00:01:36.570> eliminate<00:01:36.990> some

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
they are probably I will eliminate some

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.830 
they are probably I will eliminate some
races<00:01:37.890> because<00:01:38.759> when<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.210> want<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.509> be<00:01:39.630> already

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
races because when I want to be already

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.109 
races because when I want to be already
on<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.289> Spring<00:01:40.649> Classics<00:01:41.159> it's<00:01:41.700> not<00:01:41.880> possible

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
on the Spring Classics it's not possible

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.070 
on the Spring Classics it's not possible
for<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.720> do<00:01:42.979> 40-45<00:01:43.979> phrases<00:01:44.780> because<00:01:45.780> after

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
for to do 40-45 phrases because after

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.050 
for to do 40-45 phrases because after
the<00:01:46.470> season<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.039> so<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.490> body<00:01:47.670> is<00:01:47.820> really

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
the season and so the body is really

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.130 
the season and so the body is really
empty<00:01:48.860> but<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:49.890> think<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.399> we<00:01:50.700> were<00:01:51.140> thinking

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
empty but I think that we were thinking

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.669 
empty but I think that we were thinking
already<00:01:52.500> about<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:53.130> program<00:01:54.229> what<00:01:55.229> we<00:01:55.560> are

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 
already about the program what we are

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:57.980 
already about the program what we are
going<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:55.979> do<00:01:56.280> in<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.520> winter<00:01:56.880> so<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:57.780> think

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
going to do in the winter so I think

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.969 
going to do in the winter so I think
that<00:01:58.289> I<00:01:59.130> know<00:01:59.549> what<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:01.020> will<00:02:01.229> have<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.380> our<00:02:01.710> it

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
that I know what I will have to our it

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.969 
that I know what I will have to our it
from<00:02:02.220> the<00:02:02.399> races<00:02:02.819> and<00:02:03.049> that<00:02:04.049> I<00:02:04.200> will<00:02:04.440> lose<00:02:04.649> also

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
from the races and that I will lose also

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.639 
from the races and that I will lose also
some<00:02:05.369> ambitious<00:02:06.119> ambitious<00:02:06.929> in<00:02:07.140> the

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
some ambitious ambitious in the

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.150 
some ambitious ambitious in the
cyclocross<00:02:08.160> but<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.539> want<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.500> just<00:02:10.679> invest

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160
