00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.330

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.360
 way and welcome 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.250
 is a tutorial that for some time 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.440
 I was supposed to do it but I still did not have it. 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.090
 fight now decided to do what i know 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.380
 do a tutorial on how to install 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.689
 modules in version 1.6 point 2 mother craft 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.910
 but for now I will not do it 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.619
 It is in doubt is like having no manners 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.140
 with six points that write comments 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.320
 below this tutorial that the simple 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.180
 court says for know maybe a 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.180
 of the curious you need 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.570
 the tutorial for today is how to install tex 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.370
 have personal pecs we have already changed our 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.230
 texture you see that move us and now 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.860
 has contact with the original but I decided 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.110
 change and how I 'm going to change I 'm going to do it now 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.210
 finally you can see only 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.809
 therefore important things that you 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:02.969
 have to have athex content pec pec is not e 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.710
 where I have my bet you can see 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.470
 here at the ticket point we have 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.770
 several folders we have is risorse flames 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.659
 ex sp sun and had a poster that I 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.750
 I tested it because I thought it was here 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.610
 what was it we could open 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.490
 but it involves a strike so you can 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.950
 see and realize what I mean 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.430
 with the fact of Egypt when putting that 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.110
 bin will not do anything to get picked up by 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.500
 change angels 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.939
 it now needs to be converted 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.110
 even though you're shocking the latest version 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:40.860
 all from dexter pec to even one 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.930
 6.2 point will have problems will not 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.729
 vote for being because minecraft is 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.350
 very different now let's go to 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.189
 situation of each step see also that 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.899
 I have night point conditions too. 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.420
 many personal symbols I think it is 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.299
 simple enough to install the ceiling 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.579
 could perceive and I could only perceive by 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.619
 cause of domaine site grows more 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.790
 see now we produce the appearance 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.000
 we have is from source 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.340
 we open the fire is to make of the fact we have 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.770
 here but it does not appear here so 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.050
 let's close this well explain with how 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.340
 It works basically I'm going to take 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.560
 from here text 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.780
 Why do not you do it, I'm not going to leave it here. 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.239
 I can leave here just because it 's in 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.950
 a folder is easier but 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.280
 basically you have to see that this 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.750
 link 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.000
 everything will be fine in the personal description 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.780
 of the studio using minecraft week 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.849
 event here 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.389
 the pec resort that is so we can 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:39.459
 convert and install here the part 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:41.319
 of the pecs spectrum and teach 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.780
 It was here that I learned here that 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.480
 You have only you will have in Iraq. 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.150
 because yesterday and sectarismos mother craft 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.189
 scrap understand if you do not have this 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.019
 it will not work 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:55.209
 If you stay here, they 'll be signed. 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:58.750
 with the download page and will get 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.370
 This scent bridge there is now this is very 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.489
 important tonight when everyone is 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.829
 of windows vista and windows 8 billion in 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.829
 least unusual I think there is no more 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:11.469
 this problem we carry is seems 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:13.510
 error does not know that soon disappears again 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:14.409
 to marry you just see the window and it was 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.099
 again 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:21.010
 This is a mistake that happens a lot 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:22.810
 bad for us and for all the sun is there 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.940
 several ways of doing one of them is 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.220
 how to price jara fix 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.750
 You can not do it, I think it's 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.220
 a much simpler and much 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.310
 It's better this one that I'm going to teach. 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.439
 you have opened a test month writes 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.569
 just that I have here 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:40.870
 this will be there in the description for 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:44.079
 You, but now let's see you all go. 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:47.560
 save as you later save as 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:50.199
 slave exactly this name of the smell and 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.169
 to sit back in front of the Czech point 

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:55.599
 beats that is for us to create a boring 

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:56.470
 launch to be more to power 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:59.859
 to function 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:02.829
 is one thing that works on the server 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:05.769
 we are now coming to an end. 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:08.500
 brutal texas program to have people 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:11.139
 to be able to convert but how difficult it is 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:16.090
 find our pec was spanish 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:19.239
 remembered to have to pass the cortex 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:24.029
 to the desktop is easier to find 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:24.029
 as much as you have voice things by hand 

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:28.719
 is recorded for some time while 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.259
 convert notes also very important 

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:31.150
 folks 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:33.639
 when you are in converting the 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.229
 technicians have pecs convertou a non 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:37.719
 he converted all at once because he did not 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:39.520
 I will work bath is now the 

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:41.349
 change things all as we can see 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:45.340
 here on the console 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:48.249
 We have cheese waiting for a car after 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.499
 destroy everything be converted we can 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:56.529
 see that the two pecs have a name of 

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:58.870
 front one version and the other has a 

00:04:56.529 --> 00:05:00.669
 strange number that also seems to 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.740
 solange means you're already competing 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:05.590
 now let's pull this or let's go 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:09.699
 open our biggest craft and we're going to 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:12.129
 page now yes of chuchu pec watch and 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:13.270
 now here in the folder we are going to jump 

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:16.029
 here inside 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:20.529
 the pec already converted and now yes let's go 

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:22.599
 see if it was already working 

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:23.949
 some doubt that you are not only the 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:25.839
 our tutorial is coming to an end 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:28.180
 but any questions I have put 

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:31.629
 underneath the tuti that will produce the 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:33.159
 data now let's see is the first 

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:37.389
 Since I'm doing this, I have not yet 

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:39.159
 I tested was that you will read but what I am 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:40.509
 certainty that is working only spend 

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:46.180
 attack 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:48.009
 if feder daan van is already investigating 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.939
 I was already here on this adventure because 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:51.460
 brutal 

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:55.149

 so just do not forget that 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:03.520
 largarem not like rather a favorite 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:05.800
 to spread more than everyone has only 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.529
 difficulty this mainly because

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:17.110
 important that it be disclosed
