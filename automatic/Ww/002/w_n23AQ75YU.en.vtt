hello<00:00:05.400> welcome<00:00:05.879> back<00:00:06.450> in<00:00:07.410> this<00:00:07.620> episode<00:00:07.830> we're

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
hello welcome back in this episode we're

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.919 
hello welcome back in this episode we're
going<00:00:08.370> to<00:00:08.519> be<00:00:08.580> making<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:08.970> low<00:00:09.179> voltage<00:00:09.210> solar

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
going to be making the low voltage solar

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.480 
going to be making the low voltage solar
array<00:00:10.320> and<00:00:10.650> we're<00:00:10.800> going<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:10.980> be<00:00:11.070> making<00:00:11.219> the

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
array and we're going to be making the

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.450 
array and we're going to be making the
medium<00:00:12.000> voltage<00:00:12.179> solar<00:00:12.900> array<00:00:13.290> so<00:00:14.099> let's<00:00:14.280> get

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
medium voltage solar array so let's get

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.200 
medium voltage solar array so let's get
to<00:00:14.639> it<00:00:15.289> to<00:00:16.289> make<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.830> low<00:00:17.310> voltage<00:00:17.340> solar

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
to it to make the low voltage solar

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.140 
to it to make the low voltage solar
array<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:19.130> eventually<00:00:20.130> make<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.670> medium

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
array and eventually make the medium

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.580 
array and eventually make the medium
voltage<00:00:21.300> solar<00:00:21.779> array<00:00:22.080> you're<00:00:22.260> going<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.439> need

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
voltage solar array you're going to need

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.259 
voltage solar array you're going to need
quite<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:23.130> bit<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.550> stuff<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.029> I've<00:00:24.119> already

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
quite a bit of stuff and I've already

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.500 
quite a bit of stuff and I've already
put<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:24.720> in<00:00:24.869> this<00:00:25.050> chest<00:00:25.699> so<00:00:26.699> this<00:00:26.880> is<00:00:26.910> just<00:00:27.390> to

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
put it in this chest so this is just to

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.589 
put it in this chest so this is just to
make<00:00:27.660> one<00:00:28.170> medium<00:00:28.920> voltage<00:00:29.099> solar<00:00:29.699> array<00:00:30.150> you

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
make one medium voltage solar array you

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:31.970 
make one medium voltage solar array you
can<00:00:30.720> see<00:00:30.810> there's<00:00:30.990> loads<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.410> stuff<00:00:31.590> in<00:00:31.769> here

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
can see there's loads of stuff in here

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.900 
can see there's loads of stuff in here

there's<00:00:53.129> loads<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.760> stuff<00:00:54.030> here<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:54.480> it's<00:00:54.750> not

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
there's loads of stuff here so it's not

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.319 
there's loads of stuff here so it's not
cheap<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.140> do<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.760> has<00:00:56.910> been<00:00:56.940> quite<00:00:57.239> a

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
cheap to do this and it has been quite a

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.369 
cheap to do this and it has been quite a
bit<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.539> effort<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.870> get<00:00:57.989> all<00:00:58.079> this<00:00:58.199> together

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
bit of effort to get all this together

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.349 
bit of effort to get all this together
but<00:00:59.250> we<00:00:59.879> shall<00:01:00.120> proceed<00:01:01.910> so<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.059> first<00:01:03.210> thing

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
but we shall proceed so the first thing

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.460 
but we shall proceed so the first thing
we're<00:01:03.629> going<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.840> do<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.260> make<00:01:05.390> 128<00:01:06.470> electronic

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
we're going to do is make 128 electronic

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.760 
we're going to do is make 128 electronic
circuits<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.720> let's<00:01:09.720> just<00:01:09.900> make<00:01:10.140> these<00:01:10.470> in

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
circuits so let's just make these in

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:18.050 
circuits so let's just make these in
true<00:01:11.430> bulk<00:01:12.500> that<00:01:15.049> click<00:01:16.049> bit<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.619> lag<00:01:17.030> quite<00:01:18.030> a

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
true bulk that click bit of lag quite a

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.719 
true bulk that click bit of lag quite a
bit<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.390> lag<00:01:18.600> there<00:01:18.840> we<00:01:18.960> go<00:01:19.200> let's<00:01:20.100> do<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.340> again

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.940 

redstone<00:01:23.729> there<00:01:24.479> we<00:01:24.570> go<00:01:25.430> copper<00:01:26.430> cable<00:01:26.939> and

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
redstone there we go copper cable and

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.600 
redstone there we go copper cable and
another<00:01:28.950> 64<00:01:29.750> wait<00:01:30.750> for<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:30.990> now<00:01:31.350> they<00:01:31.530> are<00:01:31.650> okay

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
another 64 wait for it now they are okay

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.030 
another 64 wait for it now they are okay
let's<00:01:33.240> move<00:01:33.420> on<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.750> next<00:01:33.780> part<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.860> now

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
let's move on to the next part so now

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.670 
let's move on to the next part so now
i'm<00:01:35.159> going<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.369> make<00:01:35.520> 64<00:01:36.240> machine<00:01:36.689> blocks<00:01:37.049> so

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
i'm going to make 64 machine blocks so

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.950 
i'm going to make 64 machine blocks so
just<00:01:38.189> chuckle<00:01:38.640> these<00:01:38.850> in<00:01:39.619> like<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:41.840> there<00:01:42.840> we

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
just chuckle these in like that there we

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.010 
just chuckle these in like that there we
go<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.500> bit<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:43.649> like<00:01:43.890> gano<00:01:44.399> down<00:01:44.810> wait<00:01:45.810> for

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
go and a bit of like gano down wait for

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.380 
go and a bit of like gano down wait for
it<00:01:46.110> 64<00:01:46.619> machine<00:01:46.920> blocks<00:01:47.189> ok<00:01:47.850> now<00:01:48.060> we'll<00:01:48.119> make

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
it 64 machine blocks ok now we'll make

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:56.590 
it 64 machine blocks ok now we'll make
64<00:01:49.290> re<00:01:49.619> batteries<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:51.329> just<00:01:51.990> 10<00:01:54.649> redstone<00:01:55.649> and

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
64 re batteries so just 10 redstone and

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.630 
64 re batteries so just 10 redstone and
copper<00:01:57.600> cable<00:01:58.110> and

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
copper cable and

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.790 
copper cable and
eventually<00:02:01.640> we'll<00:02:02.210> have<00:02:02.950> 64<00:02:05.440> now<00:02:06.440> we'll<00:02:06.620> make

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
eventually we'll have 64 now we'll make

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.320 
eventually we'll have 64 now we'll make
64<00:02:07.490> furnaces<00:02:08.150> it's<00:02:08.810> very<00:02:09.170> simple<00:02:09.650> it's<00:02:10.330> like

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
64 furnaces it's very simple it's like

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
64 furnaces it's very simple it's like
that<00:02:12.790> go<00:02:13.790> okay<00:02:14.450> so<00:02:14.510> now<00:02:14.720> we<00:02:14.780> can<00:02:14.960> actually<00:02:15.050> make

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
that go okay so now we can actually make

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.560 
that go okay so now we can actually make
the<00:02:15.560> 64<00:02:16.280> generators<00:02:17.030> that<00:02:17.060> we're<00:02:17.360> going<00:02:17.480> to

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
the 64 generators that we're going to

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.710 
the 64 generators that we're going to
need<00:02:17.720> so<00:02:18.490> furnace<00:02:19.490> at<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:19.850> bottom<00:02:20.150> machine

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
need so furnace at the bottom machine

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.260 
need so furnace at the bottom machine
block<00:02:21.050> next<00:02:21.680> and<00:02:21.860> then<00:02:22.100> re<00:02:22.430> battery<00:02:23.090> at<00:02:23.180> the

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
block next and then re battery at the

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.040 
block next and then re battery at the
top<00:02:23.590> so<00:02:24.590> just<00:02:24.950> repeat<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.460> process<00:02:26.050> until

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
top so just repeat the process until

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.750 
top so just repeat the process until
you've<00:02:28.040> got<00:02:28.150> 64<00:02:29.470> there<00:02:30.470> we<00:02:30.560> go<00:02:30.710> okay<00:02:31.430> so<00:02:31.490> now

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
you've got 64 there we go okay so now

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.100 
you've got 64 there we go okay so now
we're<00:02:31.880> ready<00:02:32.000> to<00:02:32.120> make<00:02:32.240> 64<00:02:33.170> solar<00:02:33.590> panels<00:02:34.130> so

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
we're ready to make 64 solar panels so

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.880 
we're ready to make 64 solar panels so
let's<00:02:36.110> put<00:02:36.260> all<00:02:36.320> these<00:02:36.590> bits<00:02:36.890> in<00:02:37.960> glass<00:02:38.960> coal

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
let's put all these bits in glass coal

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.830 
let's put all these bits in glass coal
dust<00:02:40.160> glass<00:02:41.800> latronic<00:02:42.800> circuit<00:02:43.220> generator

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
dust glass latronic circuit generator

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.780 
dust glass latronic circuit generator
electronic<00:02:44.840> circuit<00:02:45.230> and<00:02:45.560> there<00:02:45.740> we<00:02:45.800> go<00:02:45.830> wait

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
electronic circuit and there we go wait

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.910 
electronic circuit and there we go wait
for<00:02:47.030> it<00:02:48.100> there<00:02:49.100> it<00:02:49.250> is<00:02:49.300> 64<00:02:50.320> now<00:02:51.320> the<00:02:51.380> next<00:02:51.590> stage

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
for it there it is 64 now the next stage

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.450 
for it there it is 64 now the next stage
is<00:02:52.160> to<00:02:52.190> make<00:02:52.520> eight<00:02:52.820> lv<00:02:53.780> transformers<00:02:54.770> so

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
is to make eight lv transformers so

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.160 
is to make eight lv transformers so
copper<00:02:56.360> across<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:57.050> little<00:02:57.700> like<00:02:58.700> that<00:02:59.170> which

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
copper across the little like that which

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.490 
copper across the little like that which
was<00:03:00.410> eight<00:03:00.650> and<00:03:00.830> all<00:03:00.920> of<00:03:01.040> them<00:03:01.160> and<00:03:02.500> wooden

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
was eight and all of them and wooden

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.740 
was eight and all of them and wooden
planks<00:03:03.860> in<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.010> corners<00:03:05.980> and<00:03:06.980> then<00:03:07.280> wires

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
planks in the corners and then wires

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.570 
planks in the corners and then wires
there<00:03:08.750> in<00:03:08.900> that<00:03:09.080> so<00:03:09.950> i<00:03:10.010> should<00:03:10.220> give<00:03:10.310> us<00:03:10.400> a<00:03:10.520> to

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
there in that so i should give us a to

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.910 
there in that so i should give us a to
those<00:03:13.150> so<00:03:14.150> now<00:03:14.390> we're<00:03:14.540> ready<00:03:14.630> to<00:03:14.750> make<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:15.290> lv

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
those so now we're ready to make the lv

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.000 
those so now we're ready to make the lv
solar<00:03:16.400> array<00:03:16.850> so<00:03:17.720> all<00:03:18.050> we<00:03:18.110> have<00:03:18.200> to<00:03:18.320> do<00:03:18.530> is<00:03:18.739> put

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
solar array so all we have to do is put

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.150 
solar array so all we have to do is put
the<00:03:19.040> lv<00:03:19.700> transformers<00:03:20.420> in<00:03:20.570> the<00:03:20.660> middle<00:03:20.870> and

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
the lv transformers in the middle and

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.650 
the lv transformers in the middle and
then<00:03:22.160> just<00:03:22.430> spread<00:03:22.730> out<00:03:22.910> the<00:03:23.030> solar<00:03:23.239> panels

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
then just spread out the solar panels

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:30.100 
then just spread out the solar panels
around<00:03:23.780> it<00:03:25.930> so<00:03:27.850> just<00:03:28.850> like<00:03:29.090> that<00:03:29.120> it's<00:03:29.959> going

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
around it so just like that it's going

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.840 
around it so just like that it's going
to<00:03:30.140> give<00:03:30.290> us<00:03:30.410> a<00:03:30.530> two<00:03:30.650> values<00:03:33.459> now<00:03:34.459> you<00:03:34.520> can<00:03:34.730> of

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
to give us a two values now you can of

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.790 
to give us a two values now you can of
course<00:03:35.090> just<00:03:35.270> plug<00:03:35.570> these<00:03:35.780> in<00:03:36.080> these<00:03:36.590> are

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
course just plug these in these are

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.070 
course just plug these in these are
working<00:03:37.250> there<00:03:37.459> they're<00:03:37.970> pretty<00:03:38.180> good<00:03:38.480> but

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
working there they're pretty good but

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.750 
working there they're pretty good but
obviously<00:03:39.560> we're<00:03:39.800> going<00:03:39.950> to<00:03:40.040> be<00:03:40.100> making<00:03:40.250> the

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
obviously we're going to be making the

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.390 
obviously we're going to be making the
medium<00:03:41.330> voltage<00:03:41.480> solar<00:03:42.110> array<00:03:42.500> so<00:03:43.220> there's<00:03:43.340> a

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
medium voltage solar array so there's a

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.000 
medium voltage solar array so there's a
little<00:03:43.520> bit<00:03:43.700> extra<00:03:43.850> we<00:03:44.180> need<00:03:44.330> to<00:03:44.420> do<00:03:44.570> now<00:03:45.010> so

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
little bit extra we need to do now so

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.580 
little bit extra we need to do now so
first<00:03:46.400> thing<00:03:46.610> we<00:03:46.730> need<00:03:46.850> to<00:03:46.910> do<00:03:47.150> is<00:03:47.590> make

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
first thing we need to do is make

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.650 
first thing we need to do is make
another<00:03:49.100> machine<00:03:49.310> blog<00:03:52.270> take<00:03:53.270> the<00:03:53.390> machine

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
another machine blog take the machine

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.479 
another machine blog take the machine
block<00:03:53.900> put<00:03:54.110> that<00:03:54.320> in<00:03:54.470> the<00:03:54.530> middle<00:03:54.770> and<00:03:55.400> then

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
block put that in the middle and then

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.120 
block put that in the middle and then
put<00:03:55.730> copper<00:03:55.970> wire<00:03:56.269> there<00:03:56.810> in<00:03:56.959> there<00:03:57.140> and<00:03:57.980> that

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
put copper wire there in there and that

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.190 
put copper wire there in there and that
will<00:03:58.250> give<00:03:58.280> us<00:03:58.400> our<00:03:58.610> medium<00:03:58.970> voltage

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
will give us our medium voltage

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.500 
will give us our medium voltage
transformer<00:04:00.640> so<00:04:01.640> now<00:04:01.850> we<00:04:01.910> can<00:04:02.120> make<00:04:02.209> the

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
transformer so now we can make the

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.870 
transformer so now we can make the
medium<00:04:03.080> voltage<00:04:03.200> solar<00:04:03.680> array<00:04:04.040> that<00:04:04.670> one<00:04:04.790> goes

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
medium voltage solar array that one goes

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.270 
medium voltage solar array that one goes
in<00:04:05.060> the<00:04:05.120> middle<00:04:05.330> and<00:04:05.480> then<00:04:06.380> your<00:04:06.560> lv<00:04:06.980> solar

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
in the middle and then your lv solar

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.090 
in the middle and then your lv solar
arrays<00:04:07.670> go<00:04:08.210> around<00:04:08.600> it<00:04:08.840> just<00:04:09.140> like<00:04:09.830> that

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
arrays go around it just like that

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.200 
arrays go around it just like that
there<00:04:11.700> it<00:04:11.820> is<00:04:13.010> ok<00:04:14.010> so<00:04:14.070> I'm<00:04:14.280> up<00:04:14.400> on<00:04:14.550> the<00:04:14.670> roof<00:04:14.970> now

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:15.210 
there it is ok so I'm up on the roof now

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.290 
there it is ok so I'm up on the roof now
just<00:04:15.810> going<00:04:15.960> to<00:04:16.020> put<00:04:16.200> this<00:04:17.150> medium<00:04:18.150> voltage

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:18.300 
just going to put this medium voltage

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.150 
just going to put this medium voltage
solar<00:04:18.840> array<00:04:19.170> down<00:04:19.350> already<00:04:19.560> put<00:04:19.830> some<00:04:19.980> wires

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
solar array down already put some wires

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.860 
solar array down already put some wires
down<00:04:20.459> and<00:04:21.180> all<00:04:21.330> you<00:04:21.390> have<00:04:21.480> to<00:04:21.570> do<00:04:21.630> is<00:04:21.750> just

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
down and all you have to do is just

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.410 
down and all you have to do is just
right<00:04:22.080> click<00:04:22.410> it<00:04:22.590> just<00:04:22.860> like<00:04:23.010> any<00:04:23.190> other<00:04:23.420> so

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420 
right click it just like any other so

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.820 
right click it just like any other so
there<00:04:24.540> we<00:04:24.630> go<00:04:24.660> that's<00:04:24.960> going<00:04:25.110> to<00:04:25.170> be<00:04:25.260> producing

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
there we go that's going to be producing

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.910 
there we go that's going to be producing
more<00:04:26.070> power<00:04:26.430> than<00:04:27.180> all<00:04:27.480> of<00:04:28.440> these<00:04:28.620> solar

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
more power than all of these solar

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.560 
more power than all of these solar
panels<00:04:29.010> and<00:04:29.400> the<00:04:29.670> ones<00:04:29.820> up<00:04:30.030> there<00:04:30.060> and<00:04:30.450> up

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
panels and the ones up there and up

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.090 
panels and the ones up there and up
there<00:04:30.600> that's<00:04:30.960> 40<00:04:31.440> I've<00:04:31.530> got<00:04:31.710> there<00:04:31.890> so<00:04:32.010> that's

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
there that's 40 I've got there so that's

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.860 
there that's 40 I've got there so that's
going<00:04:32.250> to<00:04:32.310> be<00:04:32.370> more<00:04:32.580> powerful<00:04:32.850> so<00:04:33.690> I'm<00:04:33.780> just

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
going to be more powerful so I'm just

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:34.970 
going to be more powerful so I'm just
going<00:04:34.020> to<00:04:34.110> quickly<00:04:34.230> show<00:04:34.380> you<00:04:34.560> how<00:04:34.740> to<00:04:34.800> make

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
going to quickly show you how to make

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.560 
going to quickly show you how to make
any<00:04:35.310> you<00:04:35.520> read<00:04:35.790> out<00:04:35.970> I<00:04:36.000> should<00:04:36.120> have<00:04:36.240> done<00:04:36.390> this

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
any you read out I should have done this

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.270 
any you read out I should have done this
quite<00:04:36.780> a<00:04:36.840> while<00:04:37.050> ago<00:04:37.080> because<00:04:37.740> it's<00:04:37.890> really

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
quite a while ago because it's really

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.940 
quite a while ago because it's really
really<00:04:38.790> quite<00:04:38.970> useful<00:04:39.480> tool<00:04:39.780> it's<00:04:40.530> very<00:04:40.770> easy

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
really quite useful tool it's very easy

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.820 
really quite useful tool it's very easy
to<00:04:41.100> make<00:04:41.460> so<00:04:42.270> it's<00:04:42.450> just<00:04:42.720> electronic<00:04:43.560> circuit

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
to make so it's just electronic circuit

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.320 
to make so it's just electronic circuit
in<00:04:43.890> the<00:04:43.920> middle<00:04:44.160> then<00:04:44.460> wires<00:04:44.700> down<00:04:44.970> the<00:04:45.120> side

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
in the middle then wires down the side

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.510 
in the middle then wires down the side
like<00:04:45.540> that<00:04:45.750> then<00:04:46.620> just<00:04:46.800> a<00:04:46.860> piece<00:04:47.040> of<00:04:47.070> guys<00:04:47.280> down

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
like that then just a piece of guys down

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
like that then just a piece of guys down
on<00:04:47.700> top<00:04:47.940> there<00:04:48.780> it<00:04:48.870> is<00:04:50.000> I'll<00:04:51.000> show<00:04:51.240> you<00:04:51.330> what<00:04:51.420> we

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
on top there it is I'll show you what we

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.110 
on top there it is I'll show you what we
do<00:04:51.660> with<00:04:51.810> this<00:04:52.400> so<00:04:53.400> what<00:04:53.610> we<00:04:53.700> can<00:04:53.820> do<00:04:53.910> with<00:04:54.000> the

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
do with this so what we can do with the

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.540 
do with this so what we can do with the
EU<00:04:54.270> reader<00:04:54.780> is<00:04:55.140> we<00:04:55.380> can<00:04:55.530> use<00:04:55.740> it<00:04:55.920> to<00:04:56.010> test<00:04:56.280> how

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
EU reader is we can use it to test how

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.550 
EU reader is we can use it to test how
much<00:04:56.730> II<00:04:56.880> use<00:04:57.270> going<00:04:57.570> for<00:04:57.780> a<00:04:57.870> particular<00:04:58.140> wire

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
much II use going for a particular wire

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.070 
much II use going for a particular wire
so<00:04:59.370> here's<00:04:59.610> the<00:04:59.790> medium<00:05:00.150> voltage<00:05:00.270> solar<00:05:00.750> array

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
so here's the medium voltage solar array

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.140 
so here's the medium voltage solar array
that<00:05:01.230> we've<00:05:01.350> just<00:05:01.380> built<00:05:01.890> and<00:05:02.220> if<00:05:02.880> I<00:05:02.970> just

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
that we've just built and if I just

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.050 
that we've just built and if I just
right<00:05:03.330> click<00:05:03.540> on<00:05:03.600> a<00:05:03.720> wire<00:05:03.990> and<00:05:04.880> then<00:05:05.880> right

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
right click on a wire and then right

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.080 
right click on a wire and then right
click<00:05:06.270> again<00:05:06.920> it'll<00:05:07.920> show<00:05:08.130> you<00:05:08.190> how<00:05:08.460> much<00:05:08.700> II

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
click again it'll show you how much II

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.970 
click again it'll show you how much II
you<00:05:09.420> is<00:05:09.540> traveling<00:05:10.020> through<00:05:10.260> it<00:05:10.410> on<00:05:10.560> an

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:10.980 
you is traveling through it on an

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.370 
you is traveling through it on an
average<00:05:11.130> so<00:05:11.730> it<00:05:11.850> says<00:05:12.060> they're<00:05:12.300> over<00:05:12.960> forty

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
average so it says they're over forty

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.290 
average so it says they're over forty
two<00:05:13.530> tix<00:05:13.890> so<00:05:14.490> that's<00:05:14.640> just<00:05:14.730> the<00:05:14.970> time<00:05:15.150> in

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
two tix so that's just the time in

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.760 
two tix so that's just the time in
between<00:05:15.420> that<00:05:15.690> I'm<00:05:15.810> clicking<00:05:16.020> so<00:05:16.530> you<00:05:16.590> see

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
between that I'm clicking so you see

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.990 
between that I'm clicking so you see
that<00:05:16.800> has<00:05:17.010> 172<00:05:17.880> takes<00:05:18.210> so<00:05:19.200> there<00:05:19.860> you<00:05:19.920> go<00:05:19.980> 64<00:05:20.640> EU

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
that has 172 takes so there you go 64 EU

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.160 
that has 172 takes so there you go 64 EU
from<00:05:21.210> that<00:05:21.390> one<00:05:21.510> you<00:05:21.630> can<00:05:21.750> use<00:05:21.900> it<00:05:21.930> on<00:05:22.110> all

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.170 
from that one you can use it on all

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.360 
from that one you can use it on all
sorts<00:05:22.410> so<00:05:22.890> I'll<00:05:23.160> just<00:05:23.190> go<00:05:23.550> to<00:05:23.610> my<00:05:24.530> reactor<00:05:25.530> so

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
sorts so I'll just go to my reactor so

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:27.440 
sorts so I'll just go to my reactor so
this<00:05:26.520> is<00:05:26.610> the<00:05:26.670> K<00:05:26.820> we're<00:05:26.970> coming<00:05:27.150> down<00:05:27.180> from<00:05:27.360> the

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
this is the K we're coming down from the

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.740 
this is the K we're coming down from the
reactor<00:05:27.660> again<00:05:28.380> you<00:05:28.470> can<00:05:28.590> test<00:05:28.830> that<00:05:28.980> one<00:05:29.750> 119

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
reactor again you can test that one 119

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.560 
reactor again you can test that one 119
EU<00:05:31.280> so<00:05:32.280> it's<00:05:32.460> pretty<00:05:32.700> good<00:05:32.940> tool<00:05:33.180> it's<00:05:33.420> very

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
EU so it's pretty good tool it's very

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.110 
EU so it's pretty good tool it's very
useful<00:05:33.780> for<00:05:33.990> checking<00:05:34.590> if<00:05:34.890> stuffs<00:05:35.430> likely<00:05:35.970> to

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
useful for checking if stuffs likely to

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.720 
useful for checking if stuffs likely to
blow<00:05:36.360> up<00:05:36.510> on<00:05:36.750> you<00:05:36.930> or<00:05:37.110> not<00:05:37.370> so<00:05:38.370> that's<00:05:38.520> it<00:05:38.670> for

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:38.730 
blow up on you or not so that's it for

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.340 
blow up on you or not so that's it for
this<00:05:38.940> video<00:05:39.090> thank<00:05:39.930> you<00:05:39.990> very<00:05:40.140> much<00:05:40.320> for
