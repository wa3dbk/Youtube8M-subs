powered charges are pretty decently its
charges<00:01:40.439> from<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.740> case<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.460> phone

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
charges from the case to the phone

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.190 
charges from the case to the phone
decently<00:01:42.119> fast<00:01:42.329> enough<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.780> gives<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.170> a

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
decently fast enough so it gives you a

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.780 
decently fast enough so it gives you a
little<00:01:43.380> bit<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.500> extra<00:01:43.649> boost<00:01:44.250> if<00:01:44.460> not<00:01:44.640> gonna

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
little bit of extra boost if not gonna

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.300 
little bit of extra boost if not gonna
if<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.329> battery<00:01:45.689> does<00:01:45.869> not<00:01:46.020> going<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.280> pull<00:01:47.280> it

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
if the battery does not going to pull it

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.340 
if the battery does not going to pull it
up<00:01:47.460> charge<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.360> all<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.540> way<00:01:48.659> up<00:01:48.750> full<00:01:49.049> but<00:01:49.290> at

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
up charge it all the way up full but at

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.139 
up charge it all the way up full but at
least<00:01:49.439> get<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.770> up<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:50.040> point<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:51.000> he

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
least get you up to a point to that he

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.819 
least get you up to a point to that he
can<00:01:51.299> get<00:01:51.450> close<00:01:51.630> enough<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.899> needing<00:01:52.259> we<00:01:52.710> need

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
can get close enough to needing we need

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.560 
can get close enough to needing we need
when<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.009> can<00:01:53.159> get<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.340> wall<00:01:53.909> charger<00:01:53.939> in<00:01:54.450> there

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
when you can get a wall charger in there

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.600 
when you can get a wall charger in there
so<00:01:54.750> that's<00:01:54.840> pretty<00:01:55.049> cool<00:01:55.280> it<00:01:56.280> just<00:01:56.460> took<00:01:56.549> a

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
so that's pretty cool it just took a

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.130 
so that's pretty cool it just took a
little<00:01:56.700> while<00:01:57.000> for<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.270> case<00:01:57.540> itself<00:01:57.930> to

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
little while for the case itself to

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.690 
little while for the case itself to
charge<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.530> bath<00:01:58.680> on<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:59.040> took<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.369> lot<00:01:59.520> longer

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
charge a bath on it took a lot longer

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.609 
charge a bath on it took a lot longer
than<00:01:59.969> expected<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:01.290> took<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.530> little

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
than expected so that took a little

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.700 
than expected so that took a little
while<00:02:01.770> even<00:02:02.070> when<00:02:02.219> i'll<00:02:02.369> plug

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
while even when i'll plug

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.160 
while even when i'll plug
into<00:02:03.250> the<00:02:03.430> into<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.150> wall<00:02:04.390> it<00:02:04.869> took<00:02:04.990> a<00:02:05.080> little

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
into the into the wall it took a little

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.750
