00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
but it also meant that Under Armour

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.650 
but it also meant that Under Armour
didn't<00:00:43.920> have<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.129> flagship<00:00:44.730> product<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.390> the

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
that wanted to run longer distances and

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.130 
that wanted to run longer distances and
that's<00:00:50.399> why<00:00:50.670> we<00:00:50.879> have<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.390> Gemini's<00:00:51.809> that's

eight millimeter heel toe drop which i

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.030 
eight millimeter heel toe drop which i
think<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.240> about<00:01:12.479> perfect<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.619> doesn't<00:01:13.920> feel

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
think is about perfect it doesn't feel

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.130 
think is about perfect it doesn't feel
too<00:01:14.100> drastic<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.150> both<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.600> forefoot<00:01:16.110> and

too drastic and both the forefoot and

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.219 
too drastic and both the forefoot and

technology<00:01:23.790> which<00:01:24.570> i<00:01:24.810> think<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.409> highlight

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
technology which i think is a highlight

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.800 
technology which i think is a highlight
about<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.549> issues<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.060> provides<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.540> lot<00:01:27.750> of

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
about the issues it provides a lot of

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.770 
about the issues it provides a lot of
impact<00:01:28.409> absorption<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.430> energy<00:01:30.119> return<00:01:30.509> and

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
impact absorption and energy return and

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.020 
impact absorption and energy return and
works<00:01:31.049> pretty<00:01:31.439> much<00:01:31.590> just<00:01:32.040> as<00:01:32.310> Under<00:01:32.790> Armour

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
great heel cup area that if structured

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.069 
great heel cup area that if structured
at<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.700> bottom<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.149> has<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.329> foam<00:02:06.780> layer

inside layer that's rubberized and what

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.870 
inside layer that's rubberized and what
that<00:02:16.900> does<00:02:17.140> is<00:02:17.320> that<00:02:17.560> sticks<00:02:18.100> to<00:02:18.310> your<00:02:18.400> foot<00:02:18.700> so

for several weeks I'm really sold on

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.780 
for several weeks I'm really sold on
them<00:03:10.600> I<00:03:10.690> think<00:03:10.750> they're<00:03:11.080> great<00:03:11.230> runners<00:03:11.740> and<00:03:11.980> I

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
them I think they're great runners and I

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.910 
them I think they're great runners and I
think<00:03:13.090> to<00:03:13.180> have<00:03:13.300> great<00:03:13.660> energy<00:03:14.170> return<00:03:14.650> and

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
think to have great energy return and

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.770 
think to have great energy return and
impact<00:03:15.310> absorption<00:03:15.700> here<00:03:16.120> in<00:03:16.210> the<00:03:16.270> heel<00:03:16.540> I

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
impact absorption here in the heel I

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.810 
impact absorption here in the heel I
think<00:03:17.050> they're<00:03:17.380> very<00:03:17.680> comfortable<00:03:18.040> and<00:03:18.460> I

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
think they're very comfortable and I

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.220 
think they're very comfortable and I
think<00:03:19.090> that<00:03:19.240> they<00:03:19.330> can<00:03:19.630> compete<00:03:20.080> effectively

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
think that they can compete effectively

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.050 
think that they can compete effectively
with<00:03:20.890> a<00:03:20.920> lot<00:03:21.220> of<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.460> brands<00:03:21.730> in<00:03:21.970> the

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
with a lot of the brands in the

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.300 
with a lot of the brands in the
specialty<00:03:22.480> category<00:03:23.020> that<00:03:23.710> said<00:03:24.070> I<00:03:24.100> don't

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
specialty category that said I don't

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.800 
specialty category that said I don't
think<00:03:24.640> a<00:03:24.790> lot<00:03:24.940> of<00:03:25.000> people<00:03:25.360> are<00:03:25.450> gonna<00:03:25.540> give

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
think a lot of people are gonna give

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.480 
think a lot of people are gonna give
them<00:03:25.960> a<00:03:26.050> try<00:03:26.320> just<00:03:26.800> because<00:03:27.160> they<00:03:27.310> aren't

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:27.490 
them a try just because they aren't

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.130 
them a try just because they aren't
Mizuno<00:03:27.970> they<00:03:28.180> aren't<00:03:28.360> Saucony<00:03:28.810> they<00:03:29.020> are

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
Mizuno they aren't Saucony they are

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.260 
Mizuno they aren't Saucony they are
Asics<00:03:29.620> they<00:03:29.770> aren't<00:03:29.980> Brookes<00:03:30.160> Aaron<00:03:30.520> but<00:03:31.210> I

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
Asics they aren't Brookes Aaron but I

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:32.700 
Asics they aren't Brookes Aaron but I
don't<00:03:31.450> think<00:03:31.540> that<00:03:31.810> you<00:03:31.930> should<00:03:31.960> pass<00:03:32.260> them<00:03:32.530> by

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:32.710 
don't think that you should pass them by

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.730 
don't think that you should pass them by
now<00:03:33.550> they<00:03:34.210> aren't<00:03:34.450> without<00:03:34.600> faults<00:03:35.260> though<00:03:35.470> so

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 
now they aren't without faults though so

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.320 
now they aren't without faults though so
they're<00:03:35.890> great<00:03:36.100> shoes<00:03:36.460> but<00:03:36.910> they<00:03:37.030> do<00:03:37.090> have<00:03:37.300> a

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
they're great shoes but they do have a

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.850 
they're great shoes but they do have a
few<00:03:37.540> things<00:03:37.750> that<00:03:37.990> I<00:03:38.020> didn't<00:03:38.260> like<00:03:38.500> so<00:03:38.800> much

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
few things that I didn't like so much

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.560 
few things that I didn't like so much
about<00:03:39.010> them<00:03:39.400> I<00:03:39.610> think<00:03:39.820> the<00:03:40.030> first<00:03:40.240> thing<00:03:40.360> is

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
about them I think the first thing is

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.450 
about them I think the first thing is
price<00:03:40.990> they're<00:03:41.470> just<00:03:41.650> really<00:03:41.860> expensive<00:03:42.160> at

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:42.460 
price they're just really expensive at

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.580 
price they're just really expensive at
130<00:03:43.090> dollars<00:03:43.480> they're<00:03:43.900> not<00:03:44.020> as<00:03:44.140> pricy<00:03:44.380> as<00:03:44.560> a

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
130 dollars they're not as pricy as a

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.440 
130 dollars they're not as pricy as a
lot<00:03:44.830> of<00:03:44.920> shoes<00:03:45.100> out<00:03:45.280> there<00:03:45.310> but<00:03:46.030> I<00:03:46.060> was<00:03:46.240> really

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
lot of shoes out there but I was really

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.910 
lot of shoes out there but I was really
hoping<00:03:46.660> to<00:03:46.870> see<00:03:46.960> them<00:03:47.230> come<00:03:47.500> in<00:03:47.530> and<00:03:47.770> around

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
hoping to see them come in and around

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.040 
hoping to see them come in and around
$100<00:03:48.760> and<00:03:49.000> I<00:03:49.270> guess<00:03:49.450> really<00:03:49.810> what<00:03:49.930> I'm<00:03:50.020> trying

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
$100 and I guess really what I'm trying

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.260 
$100 and I guess really what I'm trying
to<00:03:50.350> say<00:03:50.530> is<00:03:50.680> for<00:03:50.890> 130<00:03:51.460> dollars<00:03:51.790> you'll<00:03:51.970> still

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
to say is for 130 dollars you'll still

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.030 
to say is for 130 dollars you'll still
be<00:03:52.390> pretty<00:03:52.540> happy<00:03:52.930> but<00:03:53.080> man<00:03:53.410> Under<00:03:53.800> Armour<00:03:54.010> is

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
be pretty happy but man Under Armour is

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.280 
be pretty happy but man Under Armour is
really<00:03:54.340> sucking<00:03:54.790> every<00:03:55.180> ounce<00:03:55.390> of<00:03:55.690> consumer

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
really sucking every ounce of consumer

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.470 
really sucking every ounce of consumer
surplus<00:03:56.530> that<00:03:56.770> we<00:03:56.950> have<00:03:57.280> another<00:03:58.120> negative

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
surplus that we have another negative

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.000 
surplus that we have another negative
that<00:03:58.840> I<00:03:58.900> really<00:03:59.290> didn't<00:03:59.560> like<00:03:59.650> about<00:03:59.710> the

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
that I really didn't like about the

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.490 
that I really didn't like about the
shoes<00:04:00.250> is<00:04:00.460> that<00:04:01.150> I<00:04:01.360> really<00:04:01.960> expected<00:04:02.440> more

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
shoes is that I really expected more

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.500 
shoes is that I really expected more
from<00:04:03.130> the<00:04:03.550> upper<00:04:03.880> I<00:04:03.910> thought<00:04:04.180> it<00:04:04.300> would<00:04:04.390> be

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
from the upper I thought it would be

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.780 
from the upper I thought it would be
more<00:04:04.780> breathable<00:04:05.350> than<00:04:05.410> it<00:04:05.710> is<00:04:05.860> when<00:04:06.580> I<00:04:06.640> was

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
more breathable than it is when I was

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.210 
more breathable than it is when I was
running<00:04:07.180> on<00:04:07.330> concrete<00:04:08.110> for<00:04:08.350> longer<00:04:08.740> distances

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
running on concrete for longer distances

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.880 
running on concrete for longer distances
my<00:04:09.400> foot<00:04:09.760> did<00:04:10.030> start<00:04:10.360> to<00:04:10.480> overheat<00:04:10.840> with<00:04:11.740> that

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
my foot did start to overheat with that

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.700 
my foot did start to overheat with that
said<00:04:12.250> the<00:04:12.550> upper<00:04:12.940> is<00:04:13.120> very<00:04:13.660> comfortable<00:04:14.380> it

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:14.710 
said the upper is very comfortable it

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.130 
said the upper is very comfortable it
locks<00:04:15.340> your<00:04:15.550> foot<00:04:15.850> in<00:04:15.940> place<00:04:16.210> and<00:04:16.540> it's<00:04:16.930> not

locks your foot in place and it's not

locks your foot in place and it's not
terribly<00:04:17.530> thick<00:04:18.070> so<00:04:18.310> you're<00:04:18.670> not<00:04:18.760> feeling

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
terribly thick so you're not feeling

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.330 
terribly thick so you're not feeling
bogged<00:04:19.420> down<00:04:19.600> by<00:04:19.930> a<00:04:19.960> lot<00:04:20.260> of<00:04:20.380> layers<00:04:20.620> over<00:04:21.010> your

bogged down by a lot of layers over your

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.280 
bogged down by a lot of layers over your
foot<00:04:21.609> and<00:04:21.880> the<00:04:22.210> last<00:04:22.419> negative<00:04:22.870> thing<00:04:23.050> I<00:04:23.200> have

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
foot and the last negative thing I have

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.810 
foot and the last negative thing I have
to<00:04:23.380> say<00:04:23.410> is<00:04:23.680> that<00:04:23.830> I<00:04:23.860> like<00:04:24.130> the<00:04:24.250> way<00:04:24.370> they<00:04:24.520> look

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
to say is that I like the way they look

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.010 
to say is that I like the way they look
but<00:04:25.450> they<00:04:25.600> look<00:04:25.780> big<00:04:26.230> on<00:04:26.410> your<00:04:26.560> foot

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
but they look big on your foot

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.990 
but they look big on your foot
they<00:04:27.379> look<00:04:27.530> wide<00:04:28.009> on<00:04:28.250> your<00:04:28.400> foot<00:04:28.610> they<00:04:28.759> aren't

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
they look wide on your foot they aren't

they look wide on your foot they aren't
wide<00:04:29.300> they<00:04:29.720> just<00:04:29.930> look<00:04:30.169> that<00:04:30.349> way<00:04:30.410> and<00:04:30.530> it's

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
wide they just look that way and it's

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.159 
wide they just look that way and it's
kind<00:04:31.069> of<00:04:31.190> odd<00:04:31.430> and<00:04:31.729> that's<00:04:32.360> really<00:04:32.660> all<00:04:32.930> like<00:04:33.139> a

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
kind of odd and that's really all like a

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:35.409 
kind of odd and that's really all like a
drum<00:04:33.560> up<00:04:33.740> in<00:04:33.949> terms<00:04:34.190> of<00:04:34.430> negatives<00:04:34.940> they're

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
drum up in terms of negatives they're

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.260 
drum up in terms of negatives they're
pricey<00:04:35.830> the<00:04:36.830> aesthetics<00:04:37.400> are<00:04:37.639> ok<00:04:38.030> they're

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
pricey the aesthetics are ok they're

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.890 
pricey the aesthetics are ok they're
passable<00:04:38.960> and<00:04:39.169> the<00:04:39.830> breathability<00:04:40.280> is<00:04:40.699> ok<00:04:41.300> but

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
passable and the breathability is ok but
