about that and you know in the scene

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.370 
about that and you know in the scene
that<00:01:06.610> he's<00:01:07.060> describing<00:01:07.450> what<00:01:07.869> it's<00:01:07.990> like<00:01:08.140> to

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
that he's describing what it's like to

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.560 
that he's describing what it's like to
you<00:01:08.740> know<00:01:08.860> to<00:01:08.920> draw<00:01:09.310> your<00:01:09.460> pistol<00:01:09.670> out<00:01:09.940> and<00:01:10.210> he

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
you know to draw your pistol out and he

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.690 
you know to draw your pistol out and he
says<00:01:10.869> this<00:01:11.140> is<00:01:11.320> about<00:01:11.500> as<00:01:11.680> fast<00:01:11.890> as<00:01:12.159> I<00:01:12.280> can<00:01:12.340> draw

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
says this is about as fast as I can draw

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.760 
says this is about as fast as I can draw
and<00:01:13.000> he<00:01:13.060> goes<00:01:13.270> he<00:01:13.899> goes<00:01:13.930> like<00:01:14.229> this<00:01:14.409> and<00:01:14.680> it's

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
and he goes he goes like this and it's

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.100 
and he goes he goes like this and it's
not<00:01:14.950> like<00:01:15.130> terribly<00:01:15.610> fast<00:01:15.909> and<00:01:16.240> he<00:01:16.780> makes<00:01:16.930> it

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
not like terribly fast and he makes it

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.649 
not like terribly fast and he makes it
very<00:01:17.170> clear<00:01:17.500> that<00:01:17.619> he<00:01:17.890> goes<00:01:18.069> if<00:01:18.909> I<00:01:19.149> draw<00:01:19.390> it<00:01:19.420> any

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
very clear that he goes if I draw it any

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.960 
very clear that he goes if I draw it any
faster<00:01:20.229> you<00:01:20.800> know<00:01:20.920> I'm<00:01:21.130> going<00:01:21.310> to<00:01:21.460> miss<00:01:21.729> I'm

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
faster you know I'm going to miss I'm

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.969 
faster you know I'm going to miss I'm
gonna<00:01:22.060> lose<00:01:22.300> accuracy<00:01:22.659> I'm<00:01:23.560> gonna<00:01:23.800> lose

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
gonna lose accuracy I'm gonna lose

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.700 
gonna lose accuracy I'm gonna lose
precision<00:01:24.369> so<00:01:25.090> it's<00:01:25.420> not<00:01:25.539> about<00:01:25.720> like<00:01:25.840> super

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
precision so it's not about like super

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.800 
precision so it's not about like super
speed<00:01:27.130> so<00:01:27.729> I<00:01:27.759> think<00:01:27.850> there's<00:01:28.179> a<00:01:28.270> very<00:01:28.509> good

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
speed so I think there's a very good

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:37.290 
speed so I think there's a very good
lesson<00:01:29.050> in<00:01:29.470> that

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.109 

you

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.440 

okay<00:01:40.750> so<00:01:40.810> this<00:01:41.350> is<00:01:41.560> how<00:01:41.740> I<00:01:42.040> would<00:01:42.100> do<00:01:42.369> it<00:01:42.450> are

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
okay so this is how I would do it are

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.010 
okay so this is how I would do it are
you<00:01:43.510> guys<00:01:43.720> ready<00:01:43.990> you<00:01:44.680> ready<00:01:44.820> boom<00:01:45.869> just<00:01:46.869> like

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
you guys ready you ready boom just like

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.310 
you guys ready you ready boom just like
that<00:01:47.909> again<00:01:48.909> one<00:01:49.869> two<00:01:50.590> boom<00:01:51.310> just<00:01:51.940> like<00:01:52.060> that

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
that again one two boom just like that

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.420 
that again one two boom just like that
okay<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:54.880> I'm<00:01:55.360> not<00:01:55.630> concerned<00:01:56.080> with<00:01:56.440> opening

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
okay so I'm not concerned with opening

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.310 
okay so I'm not concerned with opening
it<00:01:57.520> and<00:01:57.700> catching<00:01:58.149> it<00:01:58.240> like<00:01:58.390> this<00:01:58.600> I<00:01:58.810> I<00:01:59.050> could

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
it and catching it like this I I could

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.010 
it and catching it like this I I could
care<00:01:59.530> less<00:01:59.560> right<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:01.240> main<00:02:01.390> thing<00:02:01.690> I

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
care less right the main thing I

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.800 
care less right the main thing I
understand<00:02:02.979> is<00:02:03.299> strategically<00:02:04.299> the<00:02:04.570> first

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
understand is strategically the first

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.950 
understand is strategically the first
move<00:02:05.049> I<00:02:05.290> could<00:02:05.560> use<00:02:05.940> this<00:02:06.940> part<00:02:07.420> of<00:02:07.509> the<00:02:07.600> handle

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
move I could use this part of the handle

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.260 
move I could use this part of the handle
to<00:02:08.229> go<00:02:08.350> ahead<00:02:08.440> and<00:02:08.739> strike<00:02:09.069> okay<00:02:09.910> so<00:02:09.970> that's

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
to go ahead and strike okay so that's

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.080 
to go ahead and strike okay so that's
just<00:02:10.450> about<00:02:11.260> pure<00:02:11.739> speed<00:02:12.100> the<00:02:12.610> first<00:02:12.880> thing<00:02:13.030> I

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
just about pure speed the first thing I

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.330 
just about pure speed the first thing I
can<00:02:13.239> do<00:02:13.330> is<00:02:13.420> just<00:02:13.450> do<00:02:13.780> that<00:02:13.930> aim<00:02:14.769> the<00:02:15.070> blade

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
can do is just do that aim the blade

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.790 
can do is just do that aim the blade
towards<00:02:15.730> them<00:02:16.000> if<00:02:16.390> I<00:02:16.570> get<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.870> chance<00:02:16.900> if<00:02:17.620> I

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
towards them if I get the chance if I

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.430 
towards them if I get the chance if I
don't<00:02:18.010> that's<00:02:18.430> not<00:02:18.610> a<00:02:18.640> problem<00:02:18.940> and<00:02:19.269> from<00:02:19.900> here

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
don't that's not a problem and from here

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.270 
don't that's not a problem and from here
I<00:02:20.670> understand<00:02:21.670> that<00:02:21.940> if<00:02:22.450> I<00:02:22.720> apply<00:02:23.140> pressure

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
I understand that if I apply pressure

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.820 
I understand that if I apply pressure
upwards<00:02:24.280> it<00:02:24.910> locks<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.600> blade<00:02:25.810> even<00:02:26.410> though<00:02:26.590> I

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
upwards it locks the blade even though I

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.100 
upwards it locks the blade even though I
don't<00:02:26.980> I<00:02:27.310> haven't<00:02:27.610> grabbed<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.480> other<00:02:28.569> handle

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
don't I haven't grabbed the other handle

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.520 
don't I haven't grabbed the other handle
even<00:02:29.380> if<00:02:29.590> it's<00:02:30.310> loose<00:02:30.700> right<00:02:31.000> here<00:02:31.530> applying

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
even if it's loose right here applying

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:43.210

pressure<00:02:33.690> this<00:02:34.690> way<00:02:35.280> locks<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:37.000> spine

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.720 

I<00:02:43.310> could<00:02:43.970> repeat<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:45.350> motion<00:02:45.740> over<00:02:45.950> and<00:02:46.490> over

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
I could repeat the motion over and over

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.030 
I could repeat the motion over and over

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
again so I could keep striking with this
