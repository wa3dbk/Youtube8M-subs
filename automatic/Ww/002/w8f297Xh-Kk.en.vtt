00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.930
 hello everyone welcome today we are going to 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.869
 teach how to clean do not purge the 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.369
 kidneys good to perform this step is very 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.640
 important 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.940
 prior to cooking because the kidneys 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.360
 they are a device that filters the blood 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.460
 and eliminate waste and therefore 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.010
 contains 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.930
 certain wastes and certain particles of 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.989
 blood that we do not want to be in the 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.059
 stew for that as I say it is very very 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.670
 important so much more than the method of 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:52.309
 cooked the one that is well well cleaned 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.680
 for this we use this 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:59.120
 system we could also simply 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:01.670
 throw both the salt and the vinegar 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.790
 in the water and put a casserole 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.770
 Bring to a boil 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.560
 scald the kidney and also what 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.540
 we would have or just cut it in 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.180
 pieces the pieces that we are going to cook 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.890
 and deposit it in the water mixture the 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.690
 salt and the vinegar that is what we are going to 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.150
 make us 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.370
 well here we have a kidney in this case 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.280
 is a veal kidney you see that has a 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.260
 quite large volume stews 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:30.070
 traditional because they are made with kidneys 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.780
 of pork or lamb kidney are those that 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.960
 more predominate could also be made 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.810
 with birds but good as I say the most 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:42.130
 common and frequent are these if you 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:44.890
 you fix the kidney contains turn here 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.780
 I do not know if you can see it the camera has 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.229
 here some pretty big efforts of 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:53.410
 fat that you have to eliminate before your 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.830
 cooking because good they would not form us 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.600
 part of the stew 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.730
 for it then simply with the help 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.710
 of a lace or a knife we â€‹â€‹are going to 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.500
 go trying to go pulling what is the 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.260
 kidney itself and dispensing with all this 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.360
 white part once we have all 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:13.020
 all those pieces of kidney we will put them 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.760
 in the water and we will have done the 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.940
 preparation we will leave it for space 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.620
 about two hours and we'll see how the 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.600
 result the water that initially goes 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.030
 to be quite crystal clear 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.900
 acquiring a hue due to all 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.300
 those components and waste that contains 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.280
 that are going to stay in the water like this 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.820
 is that we are going first to proceed to go 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.820
 cleaning what 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.420
 the pieces that you do now are going to be 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.980
 the pieces that we will then incorporate 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.879
 to gray so the size is going to 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.879
 go giving yourselves 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.720
 I believe that this size is adequate 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.220
 ah 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:57.900
 it is always better to remove a part of what 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.660
 that is the kidney itself that 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.940
 leave a part of those grease pawns 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:07.190
 that will disrupt us in some way 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.190
 the way we're going to do 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.060
 good 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.829
 i 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.720
 from this part dispense and masters 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.370
 and now we're just going to add here 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.610
 the a priori vinegar may seem 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:31.849
 enough but there is no problem 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:34.280
 then it's not going to transcend the stew 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:37.320
 that is, it will not take the taste of 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.780
 vinegar for nothing and salt 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.430
 as I said earlier we are going to 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:45.690
 leave here for about two hours 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:47.830
 so that little by little he releases all 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:51.150
 those debris 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:54.820
 Well, it's been two and a quarter hours 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:57.190
 approximately and you can see how 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:00.460
 the blood itself and even the waste 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:03.580
 they have been deposited in the water 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.890
 and in turn the own kidney itself and 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.170
 presents a color as if it were 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.930
 cooked vinegar is the appropriation of the 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.240
 that gives that that tonality what we're going 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.130
 to do now it's going to be simply 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.590
 Remove all this water with the help of 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:20.280
 a drainer put it under the tap and 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.660
 give a couple of baths until it is 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.340
 until it is totally clean and 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:28.320
 right now we present you in a little dish 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.320
 so you can see how we are left 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:34.310
 Well Look and after 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:36.830
 drained and washed a little the tap this 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:39.590
 is the aspect that they present that 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:43.580
 present the kidneys nothing this is a 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:46.639
 way like the more orthodox and more 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.789
 correct to debug or clean 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:48.789
 kidneys
