00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
it so dr. words my biggest strength is a

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.120 
it so dr. words my biggest strength is a
bobsled<00:02:29.610> driver<00:02:29.910> is<00:02:30.209> my<00:02:30.720> push<00:02:31.020> I'm<00:02:31.860> really

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
bobsled driver is my push I'm really

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.040 
bobsled driver is my push I'm really
fast<00:02:32.490> in<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.790> first<00:02:33.030> 50<00:02:33.480> meters<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:33.959> that

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
fast in the first 50 meters and that

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.960 
fast in the first 50 meters and that
comes<00:02:34.260> from<00:02:34.410> my<00:02:34.590> string<00:02:34.860> just<00:02:35.010> brakeman<00:02:35.520> I've

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
comes from my string just brakeman I've

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.640 
comes from my string just brakeman I've
transitioned<00:02:36.420> that<00:02:36.750> through<00:02:36.959> a<00:02:36.990> driver's<00:02:37.440> bar

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
transitioned that through a driver's bar

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.610 
transitioned that through a driver's bar
so<00:02:38.100> it<00:02:38.220> gives<00:02:38.310> me<00:02:38.550> a<00:02:38.580> great<00:02:39.150> advantage<00:02:39.620> going

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
so it gives me a great advantage going

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.490 
so it gives me a great advantage going
into<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.390> rest<00:02:42.390> of<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.600> run<00:02:42.810> because<00:02:43.019> I'm<00:02:43.320> it
