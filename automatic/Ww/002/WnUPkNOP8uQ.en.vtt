00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.230 

remember<00:01:18.810> from<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.049> case<00:01:19.290> we<00:01:19.920> first<00:01:20.310> find<00:01:20.700> the

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
remember from the case we first find the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:31.130 
remember from the case we first find the
stunned<00:01:22.580> the<00:01:23.580> speed<00:01:23.880> line<00:01:28.820> there<00:01:29.820> we<00:01:30.299> get<00:01:30.509> the

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
stunned the speed line there we get the

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.550 
stunned the speed line there we get the
speed<00:01:31.530> light

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
speed light

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.020 
speed light
it's<00:01:34.520> compatible<00:01:34.909> with<00:01:35.409> most<00:01:36.409> cameras<00:01:37.030> as

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
it's compatible with most cameras as

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.630 
it's compatible with most cameras as
long<00:01:38.299> as<00:01:38.450> they've<00:01:38.600> got<00:01:38.630> a<00:01:39.020> hot<00:01:39.680> shoe<00:01:39.920> adapter

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.149 

this<00:01:43.640> one's<00:01:43.880> quite<00:01:44.030> good<00:01:44.270> actually<00:01:45.009> you<00:01:46.009> know

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
this one's quite good actually you know

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:53.410 
this one's quite good actually you know
so<00:01:46.970> just<00:01:47.000> put<00:01:47.570> it<00:01:47.659> on<00:01:47.720> the<00:01:47.840> stand<00:01:48.170> for<00:01:48.380> a<00:01:48.470> sec<00:01:52.420> so

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
so just put it on the stand for a sec so

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.910 
so just put it on the stand for a sec so
that's<00:01:53.630> the<00:01:53.780> way<00:01:53.930> it<00:01:53.990> will<00:01:54.110> be<00:01:54.170> facing<00:01:54.500> on<00:01:54.770> the

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
that's the way it will be facing on the

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.969 
that's the way it will be facing on the
camera<00:01:57.220> up<00:01:58.220> and<00:01:58.430> down<00:01:58.720> this<00:01:59.720> one<00:01:59.990> does<00:02:00.470> go<00:02:00.680> all

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
camera up and down this one does go all

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.969 
camera up and down this one does go all
the<00:02:01.130> way<00:02:01.159> around<00:02:01.520> as<00:02:01.729> well<00:02:01.759> so<00:02:02.750> it<00:02:03.590> can<00:02:03.860> be

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
the way around as well so it can be

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.740 
the way around as well so it can be
pointing<00:02:04.340> backwards<00:02:04.850> as<00:02:05.060> if<00:02:05.210> towards<00:02:05.600> the

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
pointing backwards as if towards the

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.940 
pointing backwards as if towards the
user<00:02:05.990> and<00:02:07.119> the<00:02:08.119> other<00:02:08.300> way<00:02:08.509> only<00:02:08.780> tears<00:02:09.410> at<00:02:09.619> 90

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
user and the other way only tears at 90

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.280 
user and the other way only tears at 90
degrees<00:02:10.310> on<00:02:10.660> the<00:02:11.660> back<00:02:11.840> there

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
degrees on the back there

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.240 
degrees on the back there
that's<00:02:12.709> the<00:02:12.890> buttons<00:02:13.220> we've<00:02:13.430> got<00:02:14.800> it<00:02:15.800> can<00:02:16.070> be

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
that's the buttons we've got it can be

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.340 
that's the buttons we've got it can be
used<00:02:16.459> as<00:02:16.610> an<00:02:16.700> independent<00:02:16.970> flash<00:02:17.630> as<00:02:17.989> well<00:02:18.080> as

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
used as an independent flash as well as

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.640 
used as an independent flash as well as
a<00:02:18.500> camera<00:02:19.130> mounted<00:02:19.430> flush<00:02:19.720> so<00:02:20.720> let's<00:02:21.380> put<00:02:21.560> it

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
a camera mounted flush so let's put it

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.150 
a camera mounted flush so let's put it
on<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.739> camera<00:02:23.380> before<00:02:24.380> we<00:02:24.650> do<00:02:24.769> that<00:02:24.800> I<00:02:25.100> just

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
on the camera before we do that I just

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.340 
on the camera before we do that I just
like<00:02:25.489> to<00:02:25.610> point<00:02:25.760> out<00:02:25.940> on<00:02:26.180> this<00:02:26.390> particular

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
like to point out on this particular

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.050 
like to point out on this particular
flush<00:02:27.590> you<00:02:27.800> get<00:02:28.209> the<00:02:29.209> diffuser<00:02:29.830> and<00:02:30.940> you<00:02:31.940> also

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
flush you get the diffuser and you also

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.840 
flush you get the diffuser and you also
get<00:02:32.450> a<00:02:32.660> flash<00:02:32.930> bounce<00:02:33.200> you<00:02:34.069> can<00:02:34.310> put<00:02:34.550> the<00:02:34.640> flash

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
get a flash bounce you can put the flash

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.569 
get a flash bounce you can put the flash
bouncing<00:02:35.360> just<00:02:35.630> have<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:35.989> diffuser<00:02:36.380> or<00:02:36.800> vice

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
bouncing just have the diffuser or vice

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:41.259 
bouncing just have the diffuser or vice
versa<00:02:38.500> put<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.680> diffuser<00:02:40.310> in<00:02:40.640> and<00:02:40.850> just<00:02:41.150> have

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
versa put the diffuser in and just have

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:46.720 
versa put the diffuser in and just have
the<00:02:41.390> flash<00:02:41.600> bounce<00:02:42.370> so<00:02:43.370> let's<00:02:44.150> get<00:02:44.390> this<00:02:45.730> by

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
the flash bounce so let's get this by

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.860 
the flash bounce so let's get this by
the<00:02:46.790> way<00:02:46.910> is<00:02:47.180> battery<00:02:47.780> operated<00:02:47.810> by<00:02:48.739> batteries

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
the way is battery operated by batteries

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.569 
the way is battery operated by batteries
which<00:02:50.870> does<00:02:51.350> consume<00:02:51.709> a<00:02:51.829> lot<00:02:51.920> of<00:02:51.950> energy<00:02:52.100> on

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
which does consume a lot of energy on

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:59.610 
which does consume a lot of energy on
the<00:02:52.850> camera<00:02:53.329> so<00:02:53.989> let's<00:02:54.290> go

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.190 

see<00:03:00.620> fix<00:03:01.099> and<00:03:01.700> looks<00:03:01.940> quite<00:03:02.300> nice<00:03:02.510> from<00:03:03.020> the

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
see fix and looks quite nice from the

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.050 
see fix and looks quite nice from the
Canon<00:03:03.500> models<00:03:03.800> of<00:03:03.950> camera<00:03:04.340> just<00:03:04.670> because<00:03:04.819> of

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
Canon models of camera just because of

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.960 
Canon models of camera just because of
the<00:03:05.150> sleek<00:03:05.450> black<00:03:05.720> design<00:03:06.500> now<00:03:07.489> you<00:03:07.550> can<00:03:07.790> see

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
the sleek black design now you can see

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.510 
the sleek black design now you can see
if<00:03:08.090> I<00:03:08.180> turn<00:03:08.390> it<00:03:08.599> on<00:03:09.520> actually<00:03:10.520> mimics<00:03:10.959> what<00:03:11.959> the

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
if I turn it on actually mimics what the

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.490 
if I turn it on actually mimics what the
original<00:03:13.520> flash<00:03:13.760> on<00:03:13.940> the<00:03:14.030> camera<00:03:14.060> would<00:03:14.450> do<00:03:14.720> so

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
original flash on the camera would do so

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.260 
original flash on the camera would do so

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
had this project for a while but I

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.229 
had this project for a while but I
finally<00:03:58.620> decided<00:03:59.130> to<00:03:59.280> review<00:03:59.670> it<00:03:59.790> and<00:03:59.910> I<00:04:00.000> think

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
finally decided to review it and I think

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:06.140 
finally decided to review it and I think
