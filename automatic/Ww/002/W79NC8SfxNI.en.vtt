the<00:00:29.990> abort<00:00:30.350> is<00:00:30.590> the<00:00:30.860> same<00:00:31.100> as<00:00:31.310> pressing<00:00:31.700> the

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
the abort is the same as pressing the

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.869 
the abort is the same as pressing the
Escape<00:00:32.270> key<00:00:32.300> and<00:00:32.890> applying<00:00:33.890> will<00:00:34.219> apply<00:00:34.550> any

settings that you make that is relevant
to<00:00:37.550> that<00:00:37.670> particular<00:00:38.180> tool<00:00:38.390> without<00:00:38.630> drop<00:00:39.200> in

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
to that particular tool without drop in

to that particular tool without drop in
that<00:00:39.950> tool<00:00:40.310> settings<00:00:40.670> so<00:00:41.060> you<00:00:41.090> can<00:00:41.300> continue

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:41.630 
that tool settings so you can continue

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.920 
that tool settings so you can continue
to<00:00:41.810> work<00:00:42.170> with<00:00:42.410> those<00:00:42.560> settings<00:00:42.860> as<00:00:43.930> an

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
to work with those settings as an

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.960 
to work with those settings as an
example<00:00:45.320> if<00:00:45.590> we<00:00:45.620> were<00:00:45.950> to<00:00:46.100> select<00:00:46.280> a<00:00:46.489> polygon

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
example if we were to select a polygon

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.290 
example if we were to select a polygon
and<00:00:47.180> use<00:00:47.750> the<00:00:47.899> sweep<00:00:48.230> surface<00:00:48.680> extrude<00:00:49.300> we

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
and use the sweep surface extrude we

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.610 
and use the sweep surface extrude we
could<00:00:50.510> make<00:00:50.660> a<00:00:50.690> couple<00:00:50.930> of<00:00:51.079> bricks<00:00:51.290> throughs

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
could make a couple of bricks throughs

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.200 
could make a couple of bricks throughs
and<00:00:51.829> then<00:00:51.920> decide<00:00:52.220> actually<00:00:52.460> I<00:00:52.760> didn't<00:00:53.090> want

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
and then decide actually I didn't want

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.600 
and then decide actually I didn't want
to<00:00:53.300> do<00:00:53.420> that<00:00:53.559> well<00:00:54.559> we<00:00:54.739> can<00:00:54.890> simply<00:00:55.220> just<00:00:55.250> click

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
to do that well we can simply just click

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.220 
to do that well we can simply just click
on<00:00:55.730> abort<00:00:58.090> did<00:00:59.090> the<00:00:59.180> same<00:00:59.390> thing<00:00:59.630> again<00:00:59.750> I'm

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
on abort did the same thing again I'm

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.810 
on abort did the same thing again I'm
going<00:01:00.410> to<00:01:00.469> make<00:01:00.559> a<00:01:00.590> couple<00:01:00.860> of<00:01:00.980> extrusions<00:01:01.640> and

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
going to make a couple of extrusions and

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.970 
going to make a couple of extrusions and
I'm<00:01:02.629> going<00:01:02.780> to<00:01:02.809> decide<00:01:03.110> to<00:01:03.170> abort<00:01:03.590> but<00:01:03.860> this

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
I'm going to decide to abort but this

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.380 
I'm going to decide to abort but this
time<00:01:04.189> I'm<00:01:04.280> just<00:01:04.309> going<00:01:04.460> to<00:01:04.610> press<00:01:04.879> the<00:01:05.030> Escape

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
time I'm just going to press the Escape

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.910 
time I'm just going to press the Escape
key<00:01:06.100> that's<00:01:07.100> exactly<00:01:07.520> the<00:01:07.640> same<00:01:07.850> thing

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
key that's exactly the same thing

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.469 
key that's exactly the same thing
however<00:01:09.920> if<00:01:10.219> you<00:01:10.399> wanted<00:01:10.819> to<00:01:11.090> make<00:01:11.270> some

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
however if you wanted to make some

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.719 
however if you wanted to make some
extrusions<00:01:12.109> as<00:01:12.289> an<00:01:12.439> example<00:01:12.829> and<00:01:13.219> you<00:01:13.429> chose

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
extrusions as an example and you chose

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.679 
extrusions as an example and you chose
to<00:01:14.020> apply<00:01:15.789> notice<00:01:16.789> that<00:01:16.999> it<00:01:17.149> hasn't<00:01:17.420> actually

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
to apply notice that it hasn't actually

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:21.249 
to apply notice that it hasn't actually
dropped<00:01:18.319> this<00:01:18.590> tool<00:01:18.950> yet<00:01:19.810> what<00:01:20.810> it<00:01:20.899> does<00:01:21.049> is<00:01:21.170> it

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
dropped this tool yet what it does is it

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.199 
dropped this tool yet what it does is it
gives<00:01:21.350> you<00:01:21.499> ability<00:01:21.679> to<00:01:22.249> edit<00:01:22.549> some<00:01:22.969> of<00:01:22.999> these

00:01:23.199 --> 00:01:23.209 
gives you ability to edit some of these

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:28.209 
gives you ability to edit some of these
settings<00:01:23.630> in<00:01:23.840> here<00:01:25.149> even<00:01:26.149> amelie<00:01:26.659> or<00:01:27.219> by

settings in here even amelie or by
selecting<00:01:28.700> a<00:01:28.759> different<00:01:28.789> type<00:01:29.420> of<00:01:29.450> extrusion

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
selecting a different type of extrusion

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:31.389 
selecting a different type of extrusion
that<00:01:30.319> we've<00:01:30.469> got<00:01:30.679> within<00:01:30.859> this<00:01:31.069> particular

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
that we've got within this particular

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:37.510 
that we've got within this particular
tool<00:01:31.789> set<00:01:35.289> so<00:01:36.289> applying<00:01:36.770> doesn't<00:01:37.219> actually

tool set so applying doesn't actually

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.429 
tool set so applying doesn't actually
drop<00:01:37.789> the<00:01:37.819> tool<00:01:38.149> but<00:01:38.359> it<00:01:38.450> allows<00:01:38.719> you<00:01:38.959> to<00:01:38.990> apply

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439

that<00:01:41.840> particular<00:01:42.319> tool<00:01:43.209> finally<00:01:44.209> when<00:01:44.359> you

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
that particular tool finally when you

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.959 
that particular tool finally when you
validate<00:01:44.959> it<00:01:45.859> will<00:01:46.130> actually<00:01:46.459> finish<00:01:46.670> and

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969 
validate it will actually finish and

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:48.669 
validate it will actually finish and
close<00:01:47.179> that<00:01:47.209> particular<00:01:47.899> tools<00:01:48.139> function

close that particular tools function

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:53.379 
close that particular tools function
that<00:01:48.859> you<00:01:49.009> were<00:01:49.099> using<00:01:50.740> in<00:01:52.209> exactly<00:01:53.209> the<00:01:53.359> same

that you were using in exactly the same
way<00:01:53.779> if<00:01:53.929> we<00:01:54.049> were<00:01:54.200> to<00:01:54.380> extrude<00:01:54.889> and<00:01:55.159> we<00:01:55.819> were<00:01:55.939> to

way if we were to extrude and we were to

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.629 
way if we were to extrude and we were to
just<00:01:56.329> press<00:01:56.539> the<00:01:56.749> Enter<00:01:56.959> key<00:01:57.649> it<00:01:58.099> would<00:01:58.399> be<00:01:58.520> the

just press the Enter key it would be the

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:02.130 
just press the Enter key it would be the
