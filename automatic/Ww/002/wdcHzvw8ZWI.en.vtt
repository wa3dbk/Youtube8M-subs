00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
announcement and now i am recording this

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.550 
announcement and now i am recording this
one<00:01:05.430> against<00:01:05.640> random<00:01:05.850> tivity<00:01:06.119> obviously<00:01:06.600> and

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
one against random tivity obviously and

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.109 
one against random tivity obviously and
it<00:01:07.710> looks<00:01:07.830> like<00:01:07.950> i<00:01:08.070> went<00:01:08.280> for<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.460> 15<00:01:08.909> hatch

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
it looks like i went for a 15 hatch

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.969 
it looks like i went for a 15 hatch
hatchery<00:01:09.570> going<00:01:09.840> down<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.290> you'll<00:01:10.799> see<00:01:10.950> that

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
hatchery going down and you'll see that

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.219 
hatchery going down and you'll see that
this<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.340> 14<00:01:11.760> out<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.000> 18<00:01:12.390> because<00:01:12.570> once<00:01:13.080> you

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
this is 14 out of 18 because once you

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.870 
this is 14 out of 18 because once you
create<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.619> hatchery<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.250> lose<00:01:14.460> one<00:01:14.670> food

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
create that hatchery you lose one food

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.140 
create that hatchery you lose one food
so<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.509> went<00:01:15.810> 15<00:01:16.409> hatch<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.009> man<00:01:17.549> it's<00:01:17.790> lagging

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
so I went 15 hatch and man it's lagging

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.280 
so I went 15 hatch and man it's lagging
I<00:01:18.360> closed<00:01:18.570> all<00:01:18.720> my<00:01:18.750> background<00:01:19.170> applications

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
I closed all my background applications

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.690 
I closed all my background applications
but<00:01:19.799> it's<00:01:19.920> still<00:01:20.040> lagging<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.400> little<00:01:20.430> bit

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
but it's still lagging a little bit

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.670 
but it's still lagging a little bit
maybe<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:20.970> need<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.240> tone<00:01:21.479> down<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.810> graphics<00:01:22.439> I

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
maybe I need to tone down the graphics I

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.320 
maybe I need to tone down the graphics I
don't<00:01:23.310> know<00:01:23.400> hopefully<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.850> shouldn't<00:01:24.090> be<00:01:24.150> too

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
don't know hopefully it shouldn't be too

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.600 
don't know hopefully it shouldn't be too
bad<00:01:24.360> but<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.900> did<00:01:25.500> fear<00:01:25.860> some<00:01:26.130> kind<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.460> early

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
bad but I did fear some kind of early

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.940 
bad but I did fear some kind of early
bunker<00:01:27.090> rush<00:01:27.270> or<00:01:27.509> early<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:28.530> know<00:01:28.560> marine

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
bunker rush or early you know marine

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.270 
bunker rush or early you know marine
push<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:29.939> went<00:01:30.479> hatchery<00:01:31.290> at<00:01:31.470> 15<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:31.979> then

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
push so I went hatchery at 15 and then

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.770 
push so I went hatchery at 15 and then
without<00:01:32.549> even<00:01:32.880> getting<00:01:32.970> any<00:01:33.240> more<00:01:33.390> drones<00:01:33.659> I

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
without even getting any more drones I

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.899 
without even getting any more drones I
went<00:01:33.930> hatchery<00:01:34.290> at<00:01:34.409> 14<00:01:34.950> or<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.159> spawning<00:01:35.670> pool

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
went hatchery at 14 or a spawning pool

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.859 
went hatchery at 14 or a spawning pool
at<00:01:36.380> 14<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:38.340> that's<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:39.030> pretty<00:01:39.329> safe<00:01:39.600> fast

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
at 14 so that's a pretty safe fast

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.899 
at 14 so that's a pretty safe fast
expansion<00:01:40.320> build<00:01:40.619> not<00:01:40.799> as<00:01:40.920> economical<00:01:41.520> as<00:01:41.549> you

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
expansion build not as economical as you

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.569 
expansion build not as economical as you
can<00:01:42.090> get<00:01:42.299> but<00:01:42.570> on<00:01:42.750> scrap<00:01:43.049> station<00:01:43.500> it's<00:01:44.220> you

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
can get but on scrap station it's you

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.490 
can get but on scrap station it's you
basically<00:01:44.909> guaranteed<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.720> get<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.259> fast

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
basically guaranteed to get that fast

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.190 
basically guaranteed to get that fast

smart not placing it up there may be a

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.100 
smart not placing it up there may be a

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
to see a bit different play from me he's

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.090

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.440 
got a little line to squeeze back there
he<00:04:34.280> probably<00:04:34.490> could<00:04:34.730> have<00:04:34.760> gotten<00:04:35.000> back<00:04:35.240> there

but<00:04:35.630> maybe<00:04:36.170> he<00:04:36.440> saw<00:04:36.650> this<00:04:36.860> Roach<00:04:37.190> Warren<00:04:37.640> and

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
but maybe he saw this Roach Warren and

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.210

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.720 
but you never know it's always good to
try<00:04:42.290> to<00:04:42.410> block<00:04:42.710> that<00:04:42.890> off<00:04:42.950> as<00:04:43.160> much<00:04:43.310> as<00:04:43.460> you<00:04:43.550> can

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
try to block that off as much as you can

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.040 
try to block that off as much as you can
that's<00:04:43.880> why<00:04:44.000> you<00:04:44.120> do<00:04:44.300> it<00:04:44.330> with<00:04:44.510> the<00:04:44.630> pool<00:04:44.840> as

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
that's why you do it with the pool as

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.530 
that's why you do it with the pool as
well<00:04:45.260> so<00:04:45.590> they<00:04:46.250> have<00:04:46.370> to<00:04:46.520> come<00:04:46.760> around<00:04:46.940> here

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
well so they have to come around here

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.730 
well so they have to come around here
and<00:04:47.630> they<00:04:47.720> don't<00:04:47.810> really<00:04:48.050> have<00:04:48.170> as<00:04:48.440> good<00:04:48.680> a

and they don't really have as good a

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.150

00:06:23.059 --> 00:06:24.789 
down so right now I'd say I'm losing the

economic game sending in my overlord to

00:06:24.799 --> 00:06:26.919 
economic game sending in my overlord to

definitely<00:06:31.669> get<00:06:32.360> Mutis<00:06:32.869> right<00:06:33.259> now<00:06:33.409> against

00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:34.129

definitely get Mutis right now against
any<00:06:34.399> kind<00:06:34.669> of<00:06:34.729> mass<00:06:34.909> infantry<00:06:35.360> build<00:06:35.569> just

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:35.959 
any kind of mass infantry build just

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:37.389 
any kind of mass infantry build just
because<00:06:36.139> it's<00:06:36.289> hard<00:06:36.469> to<00:06:36.589> mass<00:06:36.739> enough<00:06:37.069> Marines

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:37.399

because it's hard to mass enough Marines
and<00:06:37.669> if<00:06:37.849> they<00:06:37.969> do<00:06:38.029> get<00:06:38.299> enough<00:06:38.509> Marines
