00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
times in the leg

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.490 
times in the leg
you're<00:00:23.509> gonna<00:00:23.630> knife<00:00:23.840> em<00:00:23.989> what<00:00:24.200> this<00:00:24.290> is<00:00:24.349> gonna

you're gonna knife em what this is gonna

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.620 
you're gonna knife em what this is gonna
let<00:00:24.619> you<00:00:24.680> to<00:00:24.739> do<00:00:24.860> is<00:00:25.040> that<00:00:25.550> the<00:00:25.910> maximum<00:00:26.300> points

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
let you to do is that the maximum points

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.359 
let you to do is that the maximum points
from<00:00:26.689> each<00:00:26.840> zombie<00:00:27.290> so<00:00:27.770> you<00:00:27.919> keep<00:00:28.040> doing<00:00:28.250> that

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
from each zombie so you keep doing that

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.880 
from each zombie so you keep doing that
for<00:00:28.520> each<00:00:28.610> of<00:00:28.759> them<00:00:28.849> and<00:00:29.380> keep<00:00:30.380> doing<00:00:30.470> that<00:00:30.559> and

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
for each of them and keep doing that and

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.880 
for each of them and keep doing that and
then<00:00:31.070> throw<00:00:31.700> out<00:00:31.730> round<00:00:32.230> one<00:00:33.230> you'll<00:00:33.559> probably

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
then throw out round one you'll probably

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.920 
then throw out round one you'll probably
run<00:00:34.070> out<00:00:34.130> of<00:00:34.250> ammo<00:00:34.640> sometime<00:00:35.149> between<00:00:35.570> round

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
run out of ammo sometime between round

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:36.910 
run out of ammo sometime between round
one<00:00:36.200> and<00:00:36.410> round<00:00:36.469> two

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
one and round two

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.500 
one and round two
and<00:00:37.429> once<00:00:37.670> that<00:00:37.760> happens<00:00:38.179> you<00:00:38.329> just<00:00:38.359> gonna

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
and once that happens you just gonna

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.299 
and once that happens you just gonna
have<00:00:38.690> to<00:00:38.750> actually<00:00:38.870> just<00:00:39.140> knife<00:00:39.379> them<00:00:39.620> but

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
have to actually just knife them but

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:42.759 
have to actually just knife them but
some<00:00:41.239> people<00:00:41.510> say<00:00:41.660> that<00:00:41.690> like<00:00:41.989> it's<00:00:42.230> not<00:00:42.320> eight

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:42.769 
some people say that like it's not eight

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:45.069 
some people say that like it's not eight
shots<00:00:43.160> and<00:00:43.399> then<00:00:43.489> a<00:00:43.519> knife<00:00:43.730> but<00:00:44.449> the<00:00:44.660> reason<00:00:44.899> is

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
shots and then a knife but the reason is

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:47.829 
shots and then a knife but the reason is
is<00:00:45.350> because<00:00:45.410> you<00:00:45.920> get<00:00:46.070> 130<00:00:46.820> from<00:00:47.359> a<00:00:47.420> knife<00:00:47.600> kill

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:47.839 
is because you get 130 from a knife kill

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:49.720 
is because you get 130 from a knife kill
and<00:00:48.050> they<00:00:48.410> can<00:00:48.559> take<00:00:48.710> eight<00:00:48.949> shots<00:00:49.249> the<00:00:49.519> leg

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
and they can take eight shots the leg

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.729 
and they can take eight shots the leg
for<00:00:50.359> each<00:00:50.480> round<00:00:50.690> is<00:00:50.839> so<00:00:51.079> around<00:00:51.320> one<00:00:51.469> you<00:00:51.589> can

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
for each round is so around one you can

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:53.169 
for each round is so around one you can
shoot<00:00:51.829> a<00:00:51.920> mate<00:00:52.070> times<00:00:52.309> and<00:00:52.519> then<00:00:52.820> knife<00:00:52.969> them

00:00:53.169 --> 00:00:53.179 
shoot a mate times and then knife them

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:54.579 
shoot a mate times and then knife them
if<00:00:53.329> you<00:00:53.449> just<00:00:53.600> knife<00:00:53.749> from<00:00:53.870> you<00:00:54.019> get<00:00:54.109> 130

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:54.589 
if you just knife from you get 130

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:56.049 
if you just knife from you get 130
points<00:00:54.769> if<00:00:55.039> your<00:00:55.429> knife<00:00:55.519> from<00:00:55.730> and<00:00:55.850> do<00:00:55.940> eight

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
points if your knife from and do eight

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.930 
points if your knife from and do eight
shots<00:00:56.329> then<00:00:56.899> you're<00:00:57.019> getting<00:00:57.109> 210<00:00:57.739> so<00:00:58.429> for

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
shots then you're getting 210 so for

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.009 
shots then you're getting 210 so for
this<00:00:59.030> to<00:00:59.120> work<00:00:59.210> you<00:00:59.359> actually<00:00:59.449> have<00:00:59.690> to<00:00:59.780> really

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:00.019 
this to work you actually have to really

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:00.910 
this to work you actually have to really
maximize<00:01:00.230> your<00:01:00.499> points

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
maximize your points

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.770 
maximize your points
so<00:01:01.550> when<00:01:01.670> trauma<00:01:01.879> 3<00:01:02.030> comes<00:01:02.239> you<00:01:02.569> should<00:01:02.690> have

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
so when trauma 3 comes you should have

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.750 
so when trauma 3 comes you should have
about<00:01:02.870> 4,500<00:01:03.530> points<00:01:04.159> you're<00:01:04.460> gonna<00:01:04.519> buy<00:01:04.699> the

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
about 4,500 points you're gonna buy the

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
Olympia and then get out of there

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:06.760 
Olympia and then get out of there
because<00:01:06.050> it's<00:01:06.230> kind<00:01:06.380> of<00:01:06.440> start<00:01:06.590> to<00:01:06.620> get<00:01:06.710> a

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
because it's kind of start to get a

little bit hectic and because it's

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.899 
little bit hectic and because it's
hectic<00:01:09.020> you<00:01:09.229> start<00:01:09.500> not<00:01:10.280> maximizing<00:01:10.820> your

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
hectic you start not maximizing your

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.620 
then you're going to go into the
elevator<00:01:24.439> that<00:01:24.799> for<00:01:25.070> me<00:01:25.159> right<00:01:25.340> here<00:01:25.610> it's<00:01:26.540> on

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
elevator that for me right here it's on

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.499 
elevator that for me right here it's on
the<00:01:26.750> left<00:01:26.960> it<00:01:27.350> has<00:01:27.439> a<00:01:27.710> double<00:01:28.369> tap<00:01:28.490> in<00:01:28.610> it<00:01:28.729> so

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
the left it has a double tap in it so

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:30.990 
the left it has a double tap in it so
not<00:01:30.110> this<00:01:30.290> one<00:01:30.469> that<00:01:30.619> I'm<00:01:30.710> in<00:01:30.799> right<00:01:30.920> now

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
not this one that I'm in right now

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.679 
not this one that I'm in right now
you're<00:01:32.000> gonna<00:01:32.060> do<00:01:32.240> is<00:01:32.299> you're<00:01:32.390> going<00:01:32.479> to<00:01:32.540> get

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
you're gonna do is you're going to get

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:36.370 
you're gonna do is you're going to get
in<00:01:32.840> that<00:01:33.020> now<00:01:33.770> this<00:01:34.520> strategy<00:01:35.030> is<00:01:35.210> a<00:01:35.320> I'm<00:01:36.320> doing

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
in that now this strategy is a I'm doing

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.459 
in that now this strategy is a I'm doing
it<00:01:36.740> solo<00:01:36.950> but<00:01:37.820> I<00:01:37.850> this<00:01:38.479> part<00:01:38.780> can<00:01:38.930> work<00:01:39.170> for

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:39.469 
it solo but I this part can work for

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:41.859 
it solo but I this part can work for
multiplayer<00:01:39.890> it<00:01:40.520> just<00:01:41.000> depends<00:01:41.630> on<00:01:41.719> how<00:01:41.810> you

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
multiplayer it just depends on how you

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.950 
multiplayer it just depends on how you
play<00:01:42.110> but<00:01:42.770> if<00:01:42.979> you're<00:01:43.100> doing<00:01:43.310> this<00:01:43.689> and<00:01:44.689> you're

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
play but if you're doing this and you're

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.920 
play but if you're doing this and you're
solo<00:01:45.289> like<00:01:45.469> it<00:01:45.740> is<00:01:46.460> one<00:01:47.210> that<00:01:47.359> takes<00:01:47.420> some

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
solo like it is one that takes some

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.840 
solo like it is one that takes some
skill<00:01:48.049> because<00:01:48.530> you<00:01:49.070> see<00:01:49.189> me<00:01:49.310> here<00:01:49.430> like<00:01:49.609> I

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
skill because you see me here like I

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.300 
skill because you see me here like I
want<00:01:50.570> to<00:01:50.600> get<00:01:50.719> on<00:01:50.840> that<00:01:50.869> double<00:01:51.829> temp<00:01:52.009> elevator

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
want to get on that double temp elevator

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.800 
want to get on that double temp elevator
right<00:01:52.490> when<00:01:52.609> it<00:01:52.700> goes<00:01:52.820> up<00:01:53.030> so<00:01:53.210> I'm<00:01:53.539> hanging

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
right when it goes up so I'm hanging

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.029 
right when it goes up so I'm hanging
around<00:01:54.020> here<00:01:54.109> but<00:01:54.289> that's<00:01:54.439> a<00:01:54.500> hard<00:01:54.710> spot<00:01:55.009> to

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
around here but that's a hard spot to

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.330 
around here but that's a hard spot to
heard<00:01:55.369> that's<00:01:55.700> very<00:01:56.210> tight<00:01:56.530> so<00:01:57.530> this<00:01:58.159> might

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
heard that's very tight so this might

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.669 
heard that's very tight so this might
not<00:01:58.369> be<00:01:58.490> for<00:01:58.759> the<00:01:58.820> the<00:01:59.780> newest<00:02:00.079> players<00:02:00.289> but<00:02:00.560> if

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:00.679 
not be for the the newest players but if

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:01.660 
not be for the the newest players but if
you<00:02:00.770> think<00:02:00.920> you're<00:02:01.070> a<00:02:01.130> good<00:02:01.280> zombie<00:02:01.369> player

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
you think you're a good zombie player

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:02.950 
you think you're a good zombie player
then<00:02:02.030> definitely<00:02:02.450> do<00:02:02.509> this<00:02:02.630> because<00:02:02.780> it's

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
then definitely do this because it's

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.990 
then definitely do this because it's
going<00:02:03.109> to<00:02:03.170> get<00:02:03.289> you<00:02:03.439> far<00:02:04.130> and<00:02:04.490> really<00:02:04.670> quickly

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
going to get you far and really quickly

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.669 
going to get you far and really quickly
so<00:02:05.929> you're<00:02:06.020> going<00:02:06.140> to<00:02:06.200> do<00:02:06.259> is<00:02:06.350> like<00:02:06.500> keep

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
so you're going to do is like keep

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:08.109 
so you're going to do is like keep
putting<00:02:06.890> them<00:02:06.950> around<00:02:07.070> and<00:02:07.399> then<00:02:07.490> eventually

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
putting them around and then eventually

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.540 
putting them around and then eventually
get<00:02:08.390> to<00:02:08.509> a<00:02:08.539> point<00:02:08.720> when<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:09.649> elevator<00:02:09.950> starts

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
get to a point when the elevator starts

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.820 
get to a point when the elevator starts
going<00:02:10.759> up<00:02:10.850> you<00:02:11.120> want<00:02:11.270> to<00:02:11.330> hop<00:02:11.480> on<00:02:11.660> that<00:02:11.830> because

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
going up you want to hop on that because

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.140 
going up you want to hop on that because
that's<00:02:13.040> going<00:02:13.130> to<00:02:13.250> take<00:02:13.370> you<00:02:13.520> to<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.030> next

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
that's going to take you to the next

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.710 
that's going to take you to the next
step<00:02:14.420> which<00:02:14.870> is<00:02:14.900> to<00:02:15.200> get<00:02:15.350> the<00:02:15.470> bowie<00:02:15.650> knife<00:02:15.920> now

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
step which is to get the bowie knife now

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.000 
step which is to get the bowie knife now
you<00:02:17.780> should<00:02:17.960> have<00:02:18.110> over<00:02:18.290> 3,000<00:02:18.680> points<00:02:18.740> if

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
you should have over 3,000 points if

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.170 
you should have over 3,000 points if
you've<00:02:19.190> been<00:02:19.310> doing<00:02:19.400> what<00:02:19.580> I<00:02:19.640> told<00:02:19.730> you<00:02:19.970> to<00:02:20.060> do

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
you've been doing what I told you to do

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.290 
you've been doing what I told you to do
just<00:02:20.690> eight<00:02:20.870> shots<00:02:21.140> and<00:02:21.530> then<00:02:21.800> knifing<00:02:22.300> and

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
just eight shots and then knifing and

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.420 
just eight shots and then knifing and
then<00:02:23.450> to<00:02:23.990> let<00:02:24.080> you<00:02:24.350> get<00:02:24.410> up<00:02:24.470> there<00:02:24.650> you<00:02:25.250> can<00:02:25.340> see

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
then to let you get up there you can see

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.680 
then to let you get up there you can see
the<00:02:25.520> bowie<00:02:25.670> knives<00:02:25.880> on<00:02:26.030> this<00:02:26.180> wall<00:02:26.390> if<00:02:26.630> you

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
the bowie knives on this wall if you

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.780 
the bowie knives on this wall if you
take<00:02:26.900> that<00:02:27.140> elevator<00:02:27.530> that<00:02:27.710> I<00:02:27.770> said<00:02:28.010> to<00:02:28.130> and

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
take that elevator that I said to and

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.430 
take that elevator that I said to and
you're<00:02:29.180> going<00:02:29.300> to<00:02:29.360> grab<00:02:29.570> that<00:02:29.750> and<00:02:30.020> it's<00:02:30.380> the

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
you're going to grab that and it's the

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.020 
you're going to grab that and it's the
same<00:02:30.620> principle<00:02:31.040> right<00:02:31.190> we<00:02:31.700> don't<00:02:31.790> have<00:02:31.880> the

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
same principle right we don't have the

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.950 
same principle right we don't have the
pistol<00:02:32.150> anymore<00:02:32.480> so<00:02:32.570> we're<00:02:32.660> not<00:02:32.720> going<00:02:32.900> to

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
pistol anymore so we're not going to

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.240 
pistol anymore so we're not going to
shoot<00:02:33.080> them<00:02:33.260> because<00:02:33.680> you<00:02:33.890> shoot<00:02:34.040> them<00:02:34.160> the

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
shoot them because you shoot them the

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.560 
shoot them because you shoot them the
Olympia<00:02:34.550> you<00:02:34.730> might<00:02:34.970> kill<00:02:35.150> them<00:02:35.270> and<00:02:35.390> you<00:02:35.450> want

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
Olympia you might kill them and you want

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.720 
Olympia you might kill them and you want
to<00:02:35.690> get<00:02:35.810> that<00:02:35.900> 130<00:02:36.530> forgetting<00:02:37.190> a<00:02:37.250> male<00:02:37.430> I<00:02:37.460> kill

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
to get that 130 forgetting a male I kill

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.580 
to get that 130 forgetting a male I kill
so<00:02:38.720> you're<00:02:38.810> just<00:02:38.870> going<00:02:39.020> to<00:02:39.080> keep<00:02:39.230> knifing

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
so you're just going to keep knifing

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.560 
so you're just going to keep knifing
them<00:02:39.680> keep<00:02:40.640> boarding<00:02:40.970> up<00:02:41.060> those<00:02:41.210> barriers

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
them keep boarding up those barriers

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.330 
them keep boarding up those barriers
because<00:02:41.990> you<00:02:42.200> really<00:02:42.710> really<00:02:42.920> want<00:02:43.190> to

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
because you really really want to

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.920 
because you really really want to
maximize<00:02:43.670> those<00:02:43.970> points<00:02:44.360> because<00:02:44.690> that's

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
maximize those points because that's

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.150 
maximize those points because that's
what<00:02:45.050> this<00:02:45.140> thing<00:02:45.200> is<00:02:45.350> all<00:02:45.560> about<00:02:45.800> right<00:02:45.980> if

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
what this thing is all about right if

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.890 
what this thing is all about right if
you<00:02:46.760> want<00:02:46.970> to<00:02:47.060> get<00:02:47.210> to<00:02:47.330> the<00:02:47.420> next<00:02:47.540> steps<00:02:47.810> and

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
you want to get to the next steps and

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.330 
you want to get to the next steps and
you<00:02:47.990> want<00:02:48.140> to<00:02:48.230> have<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.920> money<00:02:49.040> to<00:02:49.250> do

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
you want to have the money to do

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.710 
you want to have the money to do
whatever<00:02:49.490> you<00:02:49.610> want<00:02:49.790> it<00:02:49.940> starts<00:02:50.570> with<00:02:50.660> the

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
whatever you want it starts with the

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.090 
whatever you want it starts with the
little<00:02:50.930> things<00:02:51.140> it<00:02:51.290> starts<00:02:51.470> off<00:02:51.560> rebuilding

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
little things it starts off rebuilding

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.680 
little things it starts off rebuilding
those<00:02:52.190> barriers<00:02:52.520> with<00:02:53.000> making<00:02:53.420> sure<00:02:53.540> you're

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
those barriers with making sure you're

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.570 
those barriers with making sure you're
getting<00:02:53.720> those<00:02:53.959> melee<00:02:54.200> kills<00:02:54.500> because<00:02:55.430> that's

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
getting those melee kills because that's

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.250 
getting those melee kills because that's
really<00:02:55.820> how<00:02:55.940> you<00:02:56.060> maximize<00:02:56.330> it<00:02:56.780> and<00:02:56.870> you<00:02:57.110> can

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
really how you maximize it and you can

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.300 
really how you maximize it and you can
not<00:02:57.950> worry<00:02:58.220> about<00:02:58.550> them<00:02:59.500> really<00:03:00.500> really<00:03:00.800> the

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
not worry about them really really the

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.350 
not worry about them really really the
zombies<00:03:01.640> I<00:03:01.730> guess<00:03:01.850> to<00:03:01.940> become<00:03:02.150> kind<00:03:02.330> of

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
zombies I guess to become kind of

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.180 
zombies I guess to become kind of
obsolete<00:03:02.660> because<00:03:02.810> look<00:03:03.800> at<00:03:03.830> it's<00:03:04.070> an

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
obsolete because look at it's an

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.620 
obsolete because look at it's an
insta-kill<00:03:04.490> to<00:03:04.820> round<00:03:05.030> 10<00:03:05.300> and<00:03:05.450> you're<00:03:05.540> on

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
insta-kill to round 10 and you're on

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.210 
insta-kill to round 10 and you're on
round<00:03:05.810> four<00:03:06.140> you're<00:03:06.620> set<00:03:06.920> you're<00:03:07.040> gonna<00:03:07.130> be

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
round four you're set you're gonna be

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.130 
round four you're set you're gonna be
getting<00:03:07.520> all<00:03:07.580> these<00:03:07.640> points<00:03:07.880> real<00:03:08.030> quick<00:03:08.209> so

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
getting all these points real quick so

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.449 
getting all these points real quick so
what<00:03:09.470> you<00:03:09.530> have<00:03:09.620> to<00:03:09.650> do<00:03:09.770> now<00:03:09.920> is<00:03:09.950> right<00:03:10.310> you

what you have to do now is right you
gotta<00:03:10.610> get<00:03:10.730> jug<00:03:11.030> and<00:03:11.270> uh<00:03:11.360> jugs<00:03:12.110> might<00:03:12.260> hear

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
gotta get jug and uh jugs might hear

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:13.900 
gotta get jug and uh jugs might hear
from<00:03:12.440> you<00:03:12.590> yet<00:03:12.709> so<00:03:13.160> you're<00:03:13.370> gonna<00:03:13.490> do<00:03:13.640> is<00:03:13.760> just

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
from you yet so you're gonna do is just

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.040 
from you yet so you're gonna do is just
keep<00:03:14.060> getting<00:03:14.300> the<00:03:14.360> points<00:03:14.630> until<00:03:14.840> you<00:03:14.930> have

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
keep getting the points until you have

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.320 
keep getting the points until you have
enough<00:03:15.260> for<00:03:15.410> jug<00:03:15.590> I<00:03:15.910> see<00:03:16.910> just<00:03:17.060> running

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
enough for jug I see just running

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.300 
enough for jug I see just running
through<00:03:17.420> them<00:03:17.630> and<00:03:17.750> then<00:03:17.840> even<00:03:18.709> even<00:03:19.190> there

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
through them and then even even there

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.560 
through them and then even even there
than<00:03:19.400> that<00:03:19.430> but<00:03:19.670> you<00:03:19.790> can<00:03:19.910> take<00:03:20.090> the<00:03:20.180> time<00:03:20.390> to

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
than that but you can take the time to

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:21.729 
than that but you can take the time to
rebuild<00:03:20.750> the<00:03:20.870> berries<00:03:21.140> it's<00:03:21.320> just<00:03:21.470> little

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
rebuild the berries it's just little

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.350 
rebuild the berries it's just little
extra<00:03:22.010> points<00:03:22.280> that<00:03:22.430> can<00:03:22.970> actually<00:03:23.239> make<00:03:23.330> a

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
extra points that can actually make a

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.780 
extra points that can actually make a
big<00:03:23.420> difference<00:03:23.690> so<00:03:24.250> once<00:03:25.250> you<00:03:25.400> have<00:03:25.640> enough

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
big difference so once you have enough

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.430 
big difference so once you have enough
for<00:03:25.940> jug<00:03:26.150> and<00:03:26.300> it<00:03:26.390> comes<00:03:26.540> back<00:03:26.720> and<00:03:26.959> you're

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
for jug and it comes back and you're

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.140 
for jug and it comes back and you're
going<00:03:27.650> to<00:03:27.830> get<00:03:27.950> it<00:03:28.070> of<00:03:28.160> course<00:03:28.370> I<00:03:28.580> almost

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
going to get it of course I almost

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.670 
going to get it of course I almost
actually<00:03:29.390> down<00:03:29.810> there<00:03:30.019> drinking<00:03:30.410> it<00:03:30.530> but

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
actually down there drinking it but

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.840 
actually down there drinking it but
should<00:03:31.160> I<00:03:31.250> be<00:03:31.370> careful

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
should I be careful

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.870 
should I be careful
keep<00:03:32.630> knifing<00:03:32.930> away<00:03:33.170> right<00:03:33.640> making<00:03:34.640> that

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
keep knifing away right making that

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.630 
keep knifing away right making that
