00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:12.210
 hello friends with you for and today 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.289
 I would like to share with you 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.760
 first impressions of your first 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:20.910
 Apple phone 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.890
 iphone 5 just got it when i got it 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.140
 literally two hours ago 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.109
 but already had a first impression about 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:34.110
 Well, like this, the principle itself looks like 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:39.230
 The device here for comparison will show you how 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:43.340
 my old phone looks like galaxy s + 1 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:46.730
 We see that the iphone is much thinner and 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:50.760
 much more interesting 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:53.059
 as for the iphone materials on 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.180
 unlike samsung made of metal 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:01:00.590
 which gives it no elegance 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:04.769
 here it is more pleasant to put it in your hand 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:08.640
 as for the filling itself, in principle 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.909
 everything is standard here ios 6 s 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.909
 kopecks last here is the application yet 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.950
 I did not install any here because 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.740
 just got the phone yet 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.229
 only configure it for the logs it has 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.400
 everywhere and so on 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:32.970
 with regard to equipment, we then have 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:38.670
 here is such a box 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:41.880
 interesting in it we can see i already 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.509
 Of course all unsealed leave here such 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:51.450
 bukletik 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:54.770
 there is such a booklet in it 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.729
 paper is not understandable to anyone, and 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.100
 quick guide 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.219
 how iphone cool somehow me everything 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:06.439
 wonderful here and 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.439
 such an interesting thing two stickers 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:14.370
 then comes with us 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:16.020
 Here is a little charge of such a minus 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.890
 noticed but maybe access there will be 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.180
 it's ok that the cable is a bit short 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.040
 probably you will not be able to show 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.170
 how much is his length but not 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.260
 less he is a bit short 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:32.730
 there is a new connector their old not 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.080
 suitable as to what feature is in 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.980
 it is interesting when I connect 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.180
 charging so can not connect so 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.520
 matters it means he doesn't care 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:48.960
 will charge and bundling also went 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:50.370
 Here's a plan for headphones, this is new, but 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.160
 new plan headphones 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.890
 new plugs are not like what were 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.870
 before apple and you used to be 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.660
 standard now they certainly go by 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.430
 newer sound quality to me honestly 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.180
 amazed looking for iphone not 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:09.510
 connected did not listen but connected to his 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.630
 this samsung and honestly i was 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.550
 I got an iphone headset 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.430
 I think you remember from my past reviews 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:20.090
 they are cool yes all that but these 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.490
 seemingly small nothing scientists 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:28.140
 gags showed at least well 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:30.450
 the result may well be no worse than their 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.670
 need to listen for a long time there they 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.500
 warm up while i'm all that can 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.950
 sound will change well but I think not worse 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:41.040
 the side is already at the starting stage for me this 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:45.390
 like I will tell you right away friends chose 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:48.240
 between this ash and the office van is very 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.640
 very very long time choosing but still 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.610
 stopped on apple why because 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.030
 I would not have been the first phone 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.900
 apple 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:00.570
 secondly the symbol is a little more expensive and there 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.209
 also has its own nuances that is just another 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:06.120
 pecked at the stability of the same applications 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:08.760
 also the application work multitasking and 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.160
 everything is so much better organized in 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.400
 captive many will say this is nothing 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.290
 understand and the same kind of plan less powerful 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.609
 only 2 cores only gig memory all 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.739
 but it really needs to work that 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.620
 apple sim 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.270
 softer and the application keep all of them 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.020
 some more inhibited and yet 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.380
 less 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.539
 imitated than woes and that's all 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.160
 what I wanted to tell you is not a review 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:36.319
 phones is not his story 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.520
 characteristics all that brief though 

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:39.650
 I can say that since childhood is not 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.349
 dual core gigabyte day processor 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.169
 16 gigabyte ssd memory 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:46.880
 Well, I wanted to share with you these first 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:50.270
 impressions on the lephone test 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.580
 will serve happily ever after and i will be glad 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:56.020
 attacks today all thanks to all 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.020
 attention and all the best
