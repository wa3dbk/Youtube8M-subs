00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.510
 we have with us adriana we are going to 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.210
 make a face makeup 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.550
 washed good adriana the makeup of 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.920
 washed face is the most 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.189
 requested at this moment I am going to give you 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.930
 the tricks to get global me 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:26.570
 I always use the base color 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.539
 of makeup like the foil skin 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.849
 it's worth it 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.920
 Soil mix the makeup base with 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.320
 a cream a moisturizer 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.760
 normal moisturizer to get the 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.760
 Make it as light as possible 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.870
 let's apply an illuminator below 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:49.300
 eyes and we're going to apply everything 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:53.280
 is the cheek area 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.280
 in the form of an inverted triangle 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.150
 this is simply to give light 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.500
 correct the offer minimally all this 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.060
 area here that we are applying the 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.590
 illuminator the cheek area 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.970
 the sense that has that we are 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.010
 applying a lighter color than in the 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.110
 rest of the face because what we do is 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.700
 create a volume and in the rest of zones 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.170
 where you do not want to create volume what 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.780
 let's apply is a darker color 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.300
 with powder bronze powder for example 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.610
 with the bronze color more than matt for 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:24.290
 adapt the feeling that there are areas in 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.290
 the face that are more united than others 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.930
 to fix what we have done we are going to 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.370
 put loose translucent powders that do not 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.410
 they will modify the color of the 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:44.420
 skin the foundation of makeup we have 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.420
 applied all over the face 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.450
 well we continue and we will apply as 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:56.659
 we commented before the powders 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:02:00.020
 matte bronzers 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:03.829
 then we apply in the temple area 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.770
 we go down to the cheekbone and from the cheekbone to the chin 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:09.210
 we are going to apply a shadow in cream to what 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.920
 length of the entire eyelid 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.920
 so that you can not see the naked eyelid 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.610
 so as not to lose the naturalness that 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.160
 we have in the eye let's make a 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.500
 line very very very very fine and 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.230
 practically appreciable of the eyelashes 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.569
 down 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.189
 to give it a little bit of strength 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.629
 for the mascara we have 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:32.080
 chosen to schedule it look for low by 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:35.920
 favor 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.630
 because we will leave the black for 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.580
 do this same makeup but in case 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.100
 we do it at night because we're going to 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.650
 apply a rouge cream and we're going 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.890
 to apply just the same color as the 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.410
 shadow so everything has 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.060
 certain harmony it is important that in this 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.370
 Make up what we put in the color 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.080
 that are very cool pink colors 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.970
 peach colors that do not have 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.160
 practically nothing of force because what 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.690
 what it does is resemble a bit the color of 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.520
 the good health of when you are little 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.709
 That rosy color of them 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.690
 rosy cheeks we will not give 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.550
 more importance to the cheekbone 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.650
 lip and what we will do will 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.590
 to be give the light touches with the finger 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.060
 that we are going to give it the form of what 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:21.180
 is the heart of the lip that is the center 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.180
 and a little bit of color towards the sides 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.150
 how about adriana I love them because I 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.310
 I feel super pretty and I do not feel anything 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.920
 makeup are the keys to makeup 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:36.530
 of face washed freshness naturalness and 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.530
 colors similar to chao skin color
