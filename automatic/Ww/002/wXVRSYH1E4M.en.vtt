00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:05.319
 Now, welcome to this, which is 

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:07.839
 factor comic this is going to be a review of 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:09.280
 superior ironman is would be number one 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:11.860
 this is the variant cover by which 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.210
 I decided good honor I decided I 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.349
 I wanted the original cover because that 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.030
 are serious that if I want to continue 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:17.830
 irregularly with the series that I 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.300
 I want to continue so I bought the cover 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.340
 regular but in this case I could not 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.740
 find it made me quite weird had 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.360
 a lot of rosÃ© covers 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.560
 there was one of this white cover that the 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.240
 I really liked myself at the beginning 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.980
 I thought that this was the regular one but 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.950
 then I realized that no and then 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.510
 the regular I have not managed to find and 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.859
 Well, yes, he came to find it not because 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.019
 buy it because I would not like it 

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:40.719
 buy twice this same comic 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:42.550
 crazy or 26 pesos is a simple comic 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:44.679
 and because this comic is set 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.269
 after the events of axis an event 

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:48.850
 that has not been published here in mexico 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.800
 this axis event goes before tamberos 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.629
 aut and obviously before secret wars 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.239
 but good to televisa is worth a cucumber 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.579
 and did not publish it, he preferred to publish spider 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.100
 bears because I think I was going potty without 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.390
 logo and backs and if it was axis and spider 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.800
 bears more or less at the same time the 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.540
 I really do not know how all that is 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.100
 where the times because then televisa 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.110
 here you already have me very very confused 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.690
 because in this comic book a 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.060
 or urge a bit different because now 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.240
 have different mental patterns or 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.280
 it is more egocentric it is more more 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.860
 you could get to say and all this for 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.020
 red skull fault that got the 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.610
 powers onslaught and changed the patterns 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.340
 mentals of several of the avengers that 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.410
 they were in that final battle but they 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.820
 they managed to recover and the only one 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.680
 apparently has not shown signs of 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.440
 recovery but of worsening is 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.210
 tony stark and they are shown to me 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.580
 cause me a little bit of work to understand 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.020
 well the situation of the comic as was 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.150
 advancing already I could go understanding a 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.770
 little bit more what's up with this here I think 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.720
 that had an error televises an error of 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.460
 page as you can see I think this was 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.450
 a double page, this one must have gone 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.950
 here and this to live here so that 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.570
 we could appreciate the drawing well but 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.270
 well I do not know if it was a television error or 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.850
 it was error from beyond the USA 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.800
 directly but good in you then 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.450
 as I say here for some patterns 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.640
 different minds move san 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.410
 francisco and 'san francisco' beats in 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.420
 plan to make the perfect city do 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.760
 the city of tomorrow make the city 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.860
 so that everyone always dream 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.640
 and so for this starting with the 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.500
 extremis 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.600
 the substance the truth I do not know very well 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.490
 what use is being given in the 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.620
 comic because if I know what was 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.050
 driving in the comic this I knew 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.090
 because I also think that hold uses the 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.040
 extremis to be controlled so 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.160
 because they have appear several utilities 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.660
 but within this number or within 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.700
 San Francisco is used to make a 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.550
 all the perfect people to all the 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.830
 physically perfect people but 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.989
 good they are still the same way 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.880
 mentally and all this but physically 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.480
 makes them perfect as well as here 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.130
 see this girl is shown to us that after 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.840
 good as they go forward will be given 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.930
 he tells that he goes with the girl but hey 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.610
 in itself as the owner of san returns 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.200
 francisco and give him the extremism or 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.610
 let everyone be praised by the whole world 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.200
 he loves him because he has done them 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.300
 perfect but we see that all that has 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.720
 a plan back we can also see that 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.459
 As you already know about the debut, he also moved 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.170
 san francisco but he's already been a bit 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.450
 more time there and then it has become 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.730
 the guard of san francisco because of 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.220
 different legal problems he had in 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.110
 house quiche more than anything because it no longer 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.549
 can practice the profession of lawyer in 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.910
 New York then decided to move to 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.230
 other 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.510
 place and well it seemed good to him 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.970
 francisco then we see that apparently 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.990
 have debut then not 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:33.510
 it's not going well with this 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.400
 ironman's idea of making everyone perfect 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.500
 because all these people that can not be 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.820
 perfect for example the vagabonds 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.920
 is going to be attacked by all these 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.960
 rich people or all these people that already 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.580
 feels physically perfect but we see 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.170
 that all this has a plan back by 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.970
 part of enlarge as I tell you then 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.410
 it is not the ironman that everyone 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.720
 knew the brother who was going 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.280
 changing that he had already left alcohol 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.920
 that was already a norm then you can 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.160
 say that a little bit better now 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.780
 is an ironman who looked for his own 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.650
 well how can you see this one of it 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.320
 girl who had shown them 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.320
 previously they are here back 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.599
 this one here but extremis to him 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.010
 was removed and this was not because 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:15.250
 no villain but by the same 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.870
 iron man that was just a test 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.310
 free and that has finished and that works 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.299
 if they want to be perfect again 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.060
 they will have to pay 100 dollars 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.250
 daily then for the truth if 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.530
 It is very canyon and it is going 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.030
 pretty good is this first number me 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.199
 I liked the story that we liked 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.780
 presents I want to see the showdown 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:34.639
 within the debut and superior iron have 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.830
 listened to good reviews about this 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:39.620
 first arch more than anything in the with the 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.600
 hangman appearance since he has been a 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.630
 good bow I think this is what I 've 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.370
 managed to listen and what I have achieved 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.720
 so researching about venues makes me 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.310
 quite interesting and that's why it's 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.810
 mainly that I want to continue this 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.580
 series I'm going to see how the 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.990
 first bow and see if I can 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.280
 continue to follow plus I think 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.260
 yes it could become somewhat 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.750
 important within time from south 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:02.240
 because there are some scenes that I could not 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.919
 find in any comic that is published 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.750
 here in Mexico and I think they are part of 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:07.400
 superior to granma this is spoken to us in 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.680
 a number out there of years level that 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.360
 iron man is captured but it does not come out 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.810
 as only a small flashback comes out 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.540
 that he has a poster yes 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.160
 with this same armor but western and 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.540
 Well, I want to see what is happening now 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.950
 see if in this comic you can find it 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.450
 and well, this would be practically 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.490
 everything I have to say about 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:26.979
 this number 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.780
 I liked it if I recommend them if they want 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:31.240
 read something ironman because this can be 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.550
 a good time is already a little drawn 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.259
 but still the story is made to me 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.030
 interesting me personally if I go 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:38.110
 to follow so if this would be all 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.360
 for my part I hope you liked it 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.250
 give it like subscribe leave here below 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.500
 in the comments that yes they 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.060
 it seemed that you led if you 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.590
 they will follow this series if they do not go 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.780
 to follow if they already followed within 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:53.250
 why are they and so, if this 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.250
 it would be all on my part until then
