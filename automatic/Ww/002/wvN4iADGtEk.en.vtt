00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
of the things that it does here so first

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.490 
of the things that it does here so first
of<00:00:20.760> all<00:00:20.820> I've<00:00:20.939> got<00:00:21.090> an<00:00:21.210> iPhone<00:00:21.350> connected<00:00:22.350> to

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
of all I've got an iPhone connected to

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.810 
of all I've got an iPhone connected to
the<00:00:22.590> same<00:00:22.769> database<00:00:23.160> on<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.400> left-hand<00:00:23.730> side

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
the same database on the left-hand side

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.849 
the same database on the left-hand side
which<00:00:24.150> we'll<00:00:24.330> get<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.480> in<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.720> second<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.260> then

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
which we'll get to in a second and then

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.620 
which we'll get to in a second and then
of<00:00:25.980> course<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.369> iPad<00:00:26.789> version<00:00:26.820> it's<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.420> same

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
of course the iPad version it's the same

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.210 
of course the iPad version it's the same
database<00:00:27.840> we're<00:00:28.289> just<00:00:28.470> using<00:00:28.619> some<00:00:28.890> device

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
database we're just using some device

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.430 
database we're just using some device
detection<00:00:29.960> in<00:00:30.960> this<00:00:31.140> case<00:00:31.910> so<00:00:32.910> on<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.960> left

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
detection in this case so on the left

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.479 
detection in this case so on the left
hand<00:00:34.620> side<00:00:34.829> is<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.300> iPhone<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:37.340> what<00:00:38.340> I'm

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
hand side is the iPhone and what I'm

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.240 
hand side is the iPhone and what I'm
gonna<00:00:38.610> do<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:39.030> first<00:00:39.210> show<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.510> something

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
gonna do is first show you something

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.410 
gonna do is first show you something
that<00:00:41.250> we<00:00:41.370> did<00:00:41.579> here<00:00:41.610> you'll<00:00:42.030> notice<00:00:42.329> that

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
that we did here you'll notice that

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.330 
that we did here you'll notice that
there's<00:00:42.600> this<00:00:42.719> button<00:00:43.050> here<00:00:43.230> called<00:00:43.379> station

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
there's this button here called station

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.560 
there's this button here called station
map<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:44.969> kind<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.270> cool<00:00:45.510> thing

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
map and this is kind of a cool thing

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.540 
map and this is kind of a cool thing
that<00:00:46.200> really<00:00:46.350> flexes<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.860> muscles<00:00:47.309> of

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
that really flexes the muscles of

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.049 
that really flexes the muscles of
FileMaker<00:00:48.480> go<00:00:48.989> on<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.200> device<00:00:49.910> so<00:00:50.910> you'll

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
FileMaker go on a device so you'll

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.720 
FileMaker go on a device so you'll
notice<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:52.170> idea<00:00:52.469> here<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:53.070> user<00:00:53.370> is

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
notice the idea here is that a user is

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.250 
notice the idea here is that a user is
in<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.940> fire<00:00:54.210> truck<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.930> they<00:00:55.770> open<00:00:56.340> up<00:00:56.430> their

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
in a fire truck and they open up their

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.950 
in a fire truck and they open up their
iPad<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.800> iPad<00:00:59.250> has<00:00:59.309> GPS<00:01:00.180> technology<00:01:00.840> on

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
iPad and the iPad has GPS technology on

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.840 
iPad and the iPad has GPS technology on
it<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:01.500> what<00:01:01.680> we're<00:01:02.070> able<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.370> do<00:01:02.640> you'll

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
it and so what we're able to do you'll

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.700 
it and so what we're able to do you'll
see<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.180> little<00:01:03.329> icon<00:01:03.600> here<00:01:03.930> in<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.409> middle

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
see this little icon here in the middle

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.710 
see this little icon here in the middle
which<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.070> fire<00:01:05.339> truck<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.880> what<00:01:06.570> we're

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
which is a fire truck and what we're

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.840 
which is a fire truck and what we're
doing<00:01:06.960> there<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.170> we're<00:01:07.409> detecting<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.280> lat

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
doing there is we're detecting the lat

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.000 
doing there is we're detecting the lat
and<00:01:08.880> long<00:01:09.409> latitude<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.530> longitude

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
and long latitude and longitude

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.310 
and long latitude and longitude
coordinates<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.240> device<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.869> then

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
coordinates of the device and then

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.080 
coordinates of the device and then
plotting<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:13.979> on<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.189> map<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:14.939> we're<00:01:15.060> using

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
plotting it on a map and so we're using

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.440 
plotting it on a map and so we're using
the<00:01:15.450> Google<00:01:15.750> map<00:01:16.500> API<00:01:16.979> here<00:01:17.490> but<00:01:18.180> what<00:01:18.299> we've

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
the Google map API here but what we've

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.200 
the Google map API here but what we've
also<00:01:18.630> done<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:19.350> we've<00:01:19.560> plotted<00:01:19.890> all<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:21.030> other

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
also done is we've plotted all the other

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.260 
also done is we've plotted all the other
fire<00:01:21.750> stations<00:01:22.490> with<00:01:23.490> we've<00:01:23.850> got<00:01:23.880> some<00:01:24.150> data

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
fire stations with we've got some data

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.880 
fire stations with we've got some data
in<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.630> database<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.200> this<00:01:25.290> can<00:01:25.470> be<00:01:25.560> synced

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
in the database and this can be synced

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.890 
in the database and this can be synced
and<00:01:26.009> updated<00:01:26.400> by<00:01:26.430> admin<00:01:27.090> users<00:01:27.479> but<00:01:27.689> in<00:01:27.780> this

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
and updated by admin users but in this

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.770 
and updated by admin users but in this
case<00:01:28.110> what<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.890> story<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:29.790> they're

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
case what the story is is that they're

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.780 
case what the story is is that they're
driving<00:01:31.140> around<00:01:31.229> in<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.590> fire<00:01:31.740> truck<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.220> they

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
driving around in a fire truck and they

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.850 
driving around in a fire truck and they
run<00:01:33.060> out<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.360> let's<00:01:33.600> say<00:01:33.720> diesel<00:01:34.200> fuel<00:01:34.530> you

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
run out of let's say diesel fuel you

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.289 
run out of let's say diesel fuel you
notice<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.250> there's<00:01:35.430> some<00:01:35.490> filters<00:01:35.939> on<00:01:36.090> here

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
notice that there's some filters on here

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.030 
notice that there's some filters on here
on<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.479> top<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.930> they<00:01:37.500> want<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.770> know<00:01:37.860> where

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
on the top and they want to know where

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.300 
on the top and they want to know where
the<00:01:38.189> closest<00:01:39.049> fire<00:01:40.049> station<00:01:40.619> is<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:41.100> their

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
the closest fire station is to their

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.210 
the closest fire station is to their
current<00:01:41.670> location<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:42.899> we<00:01:43.110> have<00:01:43.590> latitude

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
current location and so we have latitude

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.249 
current location and so we have latitude
and<00:01:44.340> longitude<00:01:44.820> coordinates<00:01:45.360> for<00:01:45.630> every<00:01:46.049> fire

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
and longitude coordinates for every fire

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.230 
and longitude coordinates for every fire
station<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.950> then<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.670> course<00:01:47.700> for<00:01:48.180> the

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
station and then of course for the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.780 
station and then of course for the
actual<00:01:48.840> fire<00:01:49.049> truck<00:01:49.350> itself<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:50.460> here<00:01:50.640> the

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
actual fire truck itself so here the

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.580 
actual fire truck itself so here the
user<00:01:50.970> would<00:01:51.149> open<00:01:51.390> up<00:01:51.479> their<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.689> their<00:01:52.229> iPad

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
user would open up their I their iPad

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.870 
user would open up their I their iPad
just<00:01:52.799> like<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.070> see<00:01:53.220> here<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.640> they<00:01:53.700> could

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
just like you see here and they could

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.310 
just like you see here and they could
pick<00:01:54.030> one<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.360> these<00:01:54.420> filters<00:01:54.869> so<00:01:55.079> I'm<00:01:55.170> going

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
pick one of these filters so I'm going

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.679 
pick one of these filters so I'm going
to<00:01:55.350> pick<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:56.040> diesel<00:01:56.729> filter<00:01:57.119> up<00:01:57.299> on<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.509> top

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
to pick the diesel filter up on the top

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.630 
to pick the diesel filter up on the top
of<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.930> screen<00:01:58.170> here<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.619> what<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.280> does<00:01:59.460> now

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
of the screen here and what it does now

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.359 
of the screen here and what it does now
is<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.969> filters<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:01.020> map<00:02:01.259> in<00:02:01.590> these<00:02:01.860> clusters

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
is it filters the map in these clusters

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.770 
is it filters the map in these clusters
of<00:02:02.960> stations<00:02:04.670> that<00:02:05.670> have<00:02:05.969> diesel<00:02:06.390> fuel

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
of stations that have diesel fuel

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.040 
of stations that have diesel fuel
available<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:08.030> so<00:02:09.030> you'll<00:02:09.450> notice<00:02:09.660> here<00:02:09.780> in

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
available and so you'll notice here in

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.320 
available and so you'll notice here in
the<00:02:10.140> middle<00:02:10.349> right<00:02:10.679> very<00:02:11.039> close<00:02:11.430> by<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:12.120> the

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
the middle right very close by to the

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.660 
the middle right very close by to the
fire<00:02:13.720> truck<00:02:14.080> we<00:02:14.260> see<00:02:14.440> that<00:02:14.590> there's<00:02:14.830> a<00:02:15.130> number

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
fire truck we see that there's a number

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.310 
fire truck we see that there's a number
nine<00:02:15.970> and<00:02:16.450> you'll<00:02:16.600> notice<00:02:16.840> that<00:02:16.960> when<00:02:17.170> I<00:02:17.230> click

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
nine and you'll notice that when I click

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.170 
nine and you'll notice that when I click
on<00:02:17.770> that<00:02:17.800> or<00:02:18.190> when<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.430> user<00:02:18.460> clicks<00:02:18.940> on<00:02:19.120> it

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
on that or when the user clicks on it

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.750 
on that or when the user clicks on it
what<00:02:19.840> it<00:02:19.930> does<00:02:20.080> is<00:02:20.230> it<00:02:20.350> drills<00:02:20.650> down<00:02:20.770> and<00:02:21.250> it

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
what it does is it drills down and it

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.060 
what it does is it drills down and it
plots<00:02:22.030> all<00:02:22.390> which<00:02:22.780> this<00:02:23.200> is<00:02:23.410> of<00:02:23.500> course<00:02:23.740> is<00:02:23.920> the

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
plots all which this is of course is the

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.430 
plots all which this is of course is the
GPS<00:02:24.720> latitude<00:02:25.720> and<00:02:25.780> longitude<00:02:26.200> coordinates

what we're doing in this case is we're

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.790 
what we're doing in this case is we're
using<00:03:00.430> a<00:03:00.640> URL<00:03:00.820> scheme<00:03:01.530> that<00:03:02.530> works<00:03:02.830> with<00:03:03.070> the

using a URL scheme that works with the

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.310 
using a URL scheme that works with the
Apple<00:03:05.800> Maps<00:03:06.070> application<00:03:06.820> we<00:03:07.390> can<00:03:07.780> open<00:03:07.990> up

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
Apple Maps application we can open up

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.560 
Apple Maps application we can open up
the<00:03:08.500> Apple<00:03:08.800> Maps<00:03:09.010> app<00:03:09.160> application<00:03:09.610> and<00:03:10.240> pass

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
the Apple Maps app application and pass

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.560 
the Apple Maps app application and pass
it<00:03:10.810> data<00:03:11.080> in<00:03:11.440> in<00:03:11.740> the<00:03:11.830> form<00:03:12.070> of<00:03:12.160> variables<00:03:12.670> from

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
it data in in the form of variables from

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.680 
it data in in the form of variables from
within<00:03:13.770> FileMaker<00:03:14.770> so<00:03:15.400> here<00:03:15.670> all<00:03:15.850> we're<00:03:16.390> doing

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
within FileMaker so here all we're doing

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:17.850 
within FileMaker so here all we're doing
it<00:03:16.900> looks<00:03:17.260> like<00:03:17.380> we're<00:03:17.560> in<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:17.650> same

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
it looks like we're in the same

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.949 
it looks like we're in the same
application<00:03:18.120> but<00:03:19.120> what<00:03:19.270> this<00:03:19.420> allows<00:03:19.690> us<00:03:19.720> to

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
application but what this allows us to

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.440 
application but what this allows us to
do<00:03:20.260> is<00:03:20.590> make<00:03:21.340> it<00:03:21.370> appear<00:03:21.850> as<00:03:21.970> though<00:03:22.000> we've<00:03:22.270> got

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
do is make it appear as though we've got

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.470 
do is make it appear as though we've got
GPS<00:03:23.430> driving<00:03:24.430> directions<00:03:24.760> and<00:03:25.120> of<00:03:25.180> course<00:03:25.360> the

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
GPS driving directions and of course the

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.720 
GPS driving directions and of course the
audio<00:03:25.780> could<00:03:26.020> work<00:03:26.170> here<00:03:26.410> as<00:03:26.530> well<00:03:26.770> right

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
audio could work here as well right

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.570 
audio could work here as well right
inside<00:03:27.910> the<00:03:28.450> FileMaker<00:03:28.900> application<00:03:29.590> where

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
inside the FileMaker application where

back to the home page so that's a really
cool<00:03:44.100> kind<00:03:45.100> of<00:03:45.160> demonstration<00:03:45.790> of<00:03:45.880> showing

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
cool kind of demonstration of showing

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
inside of a web viewer it's JavaScript

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.530 
inside of a web viewer it's JavaScript
using<00:03:50.470> the<00:03:50.739> Google<00:03:51.010> map<00:03:51.160> API<00:03:51.550> and<00:03:52.060> we're

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
using the Google map API and we're

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.900 
using the Google map API and we're
sending<00:03:52.870> the<00:03:53.200> data<00:03:53.410> using<00:03:53.860> calculations<00:03:54.760> in

plot all the different fire stations and

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.500 
plot all the different fire stations and
then<00:04:01.989> if<00:04:02.110> we're<00:04:02.260> using<00:04:02.440> a<00:04:02.709> URL<00:04:03.070> scheme<00:04:03.610> to<00:04:04.000> to
