under which they are going after him
wouldn't<00:03:29.790> it<00:03:29.850> be<00:03:29.910> amazing<00:03:29.940> if<00:03:30.600> corporations

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
wouldn't it be amazing if corporations

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.780 
wouldn't it be amazing if corporations
were<00:03:31.470> held<00:03:31.680> to<00:03:31.799> account<00:03:31.830> anytime<00:03:32.489> they

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
were held to account anytime they

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.360 
were held to account anytime they
damaged<00:03:33.090> people<00:03:33.299> so<00:03:34.080> but<00:03:34.440> it<00:03:34.680> is<00:03:34.890> another<00:03:35.160> case

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
damaged people so but it is another case

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.520 
damaged people so but it is another case
so<00:03:35.610> usually<00:03:36.120> what<00:03:36.209> happens<00:03:36.269> is<00:03:36.810> you<00:03:37.049> privatize

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
so usually what happens is you privatize

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.470 
so usually what happens is you privatize
the<00:03:37.799> gains<00:03:38.040> and<00:03:38.340> you<00:03:38.400> socialize<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:39.030> losses

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
the gains and you socialize the losses

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.620 
the gains and you socialize the losses
so<00:03:40.049> i<00:03:40.380> put<00:03:40.650> pollution<00:03:41.160> into<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.400> air<00:03:41.519> or<00:03:42.450> into

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
so i put pollution into the air or into

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.080

the losses on you in this case the

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.880 
the losses on you in this case the
losses<00:04:05.940> were<00:04:06.090> significant<00:04:06.750> and<00:04:06.930> they<00:04:07.650> didn't

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
losses were significant and they didn't

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.620

have any money left to defend themselves

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.660 
have any money left to defend themselves
so<00:04:10.320> now<00:04:10.560> here<00:04:10.769> they<00:04:10.920> are<00:04:10.950> being<00:04:11.340> treated<00:04:11.489> like

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
so now here they are being treated like

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.180 
so now here they are being treated like
the<00:04:11.940> rest<00:04:12.120> of<00:04:12.269> us<00:04:12.420> well<00:04:13.230> i<00:04:13.500> guess<00:04:13.890> that's<00:04:14.100> a

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
the rest of us well i guess that's a

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.430 
the rest of us well i guess that's a
degree<00:04:14.459> of<00:04:14.489> justice<00:04:14.940> so<00:04:15.570> considering<00:04:16.260> the

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
degree of justice so considering the

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.319 
degree of justice so considering the
fact<00:04:16.650> that<00:04:16.769> nine<00:04:17.040> people<00:04:17.430> died<00:04:17.669> as<00:04:18.060> a<00:04:18.090> result

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
fact that nine people died as a result

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.140 
fact that nine people died as a result
of<00:04:18.690> what<00:04:19.650> this<00:04:19.859> company<00:04:20.250> did<00:04:20.579> what<00:04:21.000> do<00:04:21.060> you

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150

that<00:04:23.700> it<00:04:23.789> makes<00:04:23.940> sense<00:04:24.180> mm-hmm<00:04:25.110> well<00:04:25.680> first<00:04:25.950> of

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
that it makes sense mm-hmm well first of

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.040 
that it makes sense mm-hmm well first of
all

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
there's all these things that he was a

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.409 
there's all these things that he was a
convicted<00:04:39.860> of<00:04:40.220> obstruction<00:04:40.610> of<00:04:40.789> justice<00:04:40.819> wire

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:44.529 
convicted of obstruction of justice wire
fraud<00:04:41.810> and<00:04:42.129> and<00:04:43.129> again<00:04:43.879> if<00:04:44.060> he<00:04:44.150> wasn't<00:04:44.509> a

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:44.539 
fraud and and again if he wasn't a

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:46.420 
fraud and and again if he wasn't a
corporate<00:04:44.840> executive<00:04:44.930> would<00:04:45.889> he<00:04:46.039> get<00:04:46.220> life

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430

corporate executive would he get life
behind<00:04:46.639> bars<00:04:47.030> very<00:04:47.810> likely<00:04:48.050> so<00:04:48.440> right<00:04:49.039> and<00:04:49.280> so

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
behind bars very likely so right and so

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.999 
behind bars very likely so right and so
should<00:04:50.629> the<00:04:50.720> law<00:04:50.870> apply<00:04:51.139> to<00:04:51.199> him<00:04:51.409> equally<00:04:51.740> of

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:52.009 
should the law apply to him equally of

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
course this do I have a sense like is

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:56.230 
course this do I have a sense like is
there<00:04:55.220> a<00:04:55.280> point<00:04:55.490> at<00:04:55.610> which<00:04:55.759> i<00:04:55.940> would<00:04:56.000> give

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:13.089 
that could happen that could happen but
we<00:05:11.569> would<00:05:11.719> not<00:05:11.870> another<00:05:12.349> country<00:05:12.740> we<00:05:12.889> live<00:05:13.069> in

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:13.099

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:16.059 
we would not another country we live in
right<00:05:13.759> so<00:05:14.509> in<00:05:14.690> this<00:05:14.810> case<00:05:15.080> nine<00:05:15.500> people<00:05:15.889> died

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:16.069
