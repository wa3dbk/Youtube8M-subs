speeds here of course if we would do a
browser<00:04:19.160> speed<00:04:19.579> test<00:04:19.880> we<00:04:20.389> might<00:04:20.570> see<00:04:20.780> a

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
browser speed test we might see a

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.230 
browser speed test we might see a
different<00:04:21.229> score<00:04:21.919> because<00:04:22.160> apples<00:04:22.940> really

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
different score because apples really

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.050 
different score because apples really
really<00:04:23.419> good<00:04:23.540> at<00:04:23.630> optimizing<00:04:24.139> their<00:04:24.229> software

but<00:04:26.060> if<00:04:26.270> you<00:04:26.450> would<00:04:26.630> use<00:04:26.780> like<00:04:26.990> 20-25<00:04:27.919> maybe

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
but if you would use like 20-25 maybe

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.010 
but if you would use like 20-25 maybe
you<00:04:28.370> turn<00:04:28.550> something<00:04:28.820> gonna<00:04:29.389> upload<00:04:29.660> false

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
you turn something gonna upload false

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.440 
you turn something gonna upload false
and<00:04:30.380> the<00:04:30.430> s4<00:04:31.430> mini<00:04:31.460> could<00:04:31.910> be<00:04:32.060> a<00:04:32.090> good<00:04:32.240> boy<00:04:32.419> for
