rock I'm gonna go in with a marowak
marowak<00:00:17.880> has<00:00:18.449> like<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.869> high<00:00:19.109> I<00:00:19.140> thinks<00:00:19.529> the

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
marowak has like the high I thinks the

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.710 
marowak has like the high I thinks the
highest<00:00:20.070> attack<00:00:20.340> in<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.609> game<00:00:20.850> if<00:00:21.420> you<00:00:21.480> give

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
highest attack in the game if you give

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.019 
highest attack in the game if you give
it<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.900> thick<00:00:22.170> Club<00:00:22.460> so<00:00:23.460> yeah<00:00:23.789> that's<00:00:23.970> pretty

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
it a thick Club so yeah that's pretty

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.210 
it a thick Club so yeah that's pretty
nice<00:00:24.330> also<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:24.869> is<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.080> complete<00:00:25.650> defensive

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
nice also it is a complete defensive

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.740 
nice also it is a complete defensive
tank<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:26.670> probably<00:00:26.789> start<00:00:27.210> strongest

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
tank is probably start strongest

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.679 
tank is probably start strongest
defensive<00:00:28.140> tank<00:00:28.410> on<00:00:28.590> this<00:00:28.920> team<00:00:29.189> so<00:00:30.029> yeah

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
defensive tank on this team so yeah

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.990 
defensive tank on this team so yeah
you're<00:00:30.869> about<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.170> see<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.859> attacking<00:00:32.700> power

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
you're about to see the attacking power

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.430 
you're about to see the attacking power
got<00:00:33.239> earthquake<00:00:33.630> against<00:00:33.870> Reggie<00:00:34.140> Rock

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
got earthquake against Reggie Rock

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.470 
got earthquake against Reggie Rock
Reggie<00:00:35.130> rock<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:35.850> I'm<00:00:36.000> guessing<00:00:36.420> this

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
Reggie rock this I'm guessing this

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.569 
Reggie rock this I'm guessing this
Reggie<00:00:36.719> rock<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.170> maxed<00:00:37.590> out<00:00:37.680> defense<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.219> HP

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
Reggie rock is maxed out defense in HP

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.090 
Reggie rock is maxed out defense in HP
cuz<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.870> actually<00:00:40.230> took<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.410> decently

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
cuz it to actually took that decently

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.740 
cuz it to actually took that decently
well<00:00:41.309> considering<00:00:41.730> I'm<00:00:41.850> using<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.120> marowak<00:00:42.510> and

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
well considering I'm using a marowak and

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.940 
well considering I'm using a marowak and
a<00:00:43.260> stab<00:00:43.860> boosted<00:00:44.280> earthquake<00:00:44.809> so<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:46.110> predicted

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
a stab boosted earthquake so I predicted

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.000 
a stab boosted earthquake so I predicted
a<00:00:47.100> switch<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.059> use<00:00:48.390> Stone<00:00:48.750> Edge<00:00:48.930> like<00:00:49.710> just

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
a switch so I use Stone Edge like just

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.889 
a switch so I use Stone Edge like just
in<00:00:50.190> case<00:00:50.430> he<00:00:50.670> switched<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.149> hit<00:00:51.360> him<00:00:51.480> which<00:00:51.780> is

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
in case he switched to hit him which is

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.060 
in case he switched to hit him which is
nice<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.199> would<00:00:52.289> have<00:00:52.350> been<00:00:52.500> kind<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.739> pissed<00:00:52.890> if

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
nice I would have been kind of pissed if

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.400 
nice I would have been kind of pissed if
it<00:00:53.190> missed<00:00:53.430> anyway<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:54.270> he<00:00:54.510> sends<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:54.960> floatzel

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
it missed anyway so he sends in floatzel

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.350 
it missed anyway so he sends in floatzel
I<00:00:55.590> know<00:00:55.680> he's<00:00:56.100> gonna<00:00:56.280> use<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.730> water-type

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
I know he's gonna use a water-type

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.180 
I know he's gonna use a water-type
attack<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:57.840> I'm<00:00:57.930> gonna<00:00:58.020> switch<00:00:58.289> in<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.649> my

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
attack so I'm gonna switch in to my

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.790 
attack so I'm gonna switch in to my
water<00:00:59.489> absorb<00:00:59.969> Lapras<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.780> gets<00:01:00.989> hit<00:01:01.230> by<00:01:01.770> the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
water absorb Lapras it gets hit by the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.650 
water absorb Lapras it gets hit by the
stealth<00:01:02.160> rocks<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.699> does<00:01:02.850> 25%<00:01:03.270> damage

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
stealth rocks that does 25% damage

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.329 
stealth rocks that does 25% damage
because<00:01:04.110> it's<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.320> nice<00:01:04.470> type<00:01:04.739> but<00:01:04.920> then<00:01:05.010> aqua

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
because it's a nice type but then aqua

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.580 
because it's a nice type but then aqua
jet<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:06.030> gonna<00:01:06.299> heal<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.720> completely<00:01:07.409> after

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
jet is gonna heal it completely after

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.609 
jet is gonna heal it completely after
water<00:01:07.950> zorb<00:01:08.280> completely<00:01:08.760> completely<00:01:09.210> yeah<00:01:09.619> so

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
water zorb completely completely yeah so

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.830 
water zorb completely completely yeah so
he's<00:01:10.890> obviously<00:01:11.220> gonna<00:01:11.670> withdraw<00:01:11.909> but<00:01:12.630> I

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
he's obviously gonna withdraw but I

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.200 
he's obviously gonna withdraw but I
guess<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:13.650> didn't<00:01:14.159> really<00:01:14.340> see<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.549> coming<00:01:14.729> I

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
guess I didn't really see that coming I

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.090 
guess I didn't really see that coming I
don't<00:01:15.360> think<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.049> use<00:01:16.229> Thunderbolt<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:17.009> know

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
don't think so I use Thunderbolt I know

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.160 
don't think so I use Thunderbolt I know
I<00:01:17.130> fake<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.520> figured<00:01:18.119> he<00:01:18.420> might<00:01:18.630> have<00:01:18.900> like

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
I fake I figured he might have like

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.499 
I fake I figured he might have like
another<00:01:19.439> attack<00:01:19.770> against<00:01:20.159> Lapras<00:01:20.610> but<00:01:21.390> it

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
another attack against Lapras but it

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.450 
another attack against Lapras but it
seems<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:22.080> he<00:01:22.259> was<00:01:22.409> banded<00:01:23.040> I'm<00:01:23.189> gonna<00:01:23.340> go

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
seems that he was banded I'm gonna go

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.859 
seems that he was banded I'm gonna go
ahead<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.790> say<00:01:23.909> was<00:01:24.090> banded<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:24.630> I'm

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
ahead and say was banded so I'm

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.020 
ahead and say was banded so I'm
predicting<00:01:25.500> an<00:01:25.619> electric-type<00:01:25.979> attack<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:27.000> I

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
predicting an electric-type attack so I

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.999 
predicting an electric-type attack so I
go<00:01:27.270> with<00:01:27.420> Quagsire<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.200> he's<00:01:28.619> gonna<00:01:28.829> use

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
go with Quagsire and he's gonna use

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.950 
go with Quagsire and he's gonna use
trick<00:01:29.400> which<00:01:29.549> he<00:01:29.670> was<00:01:29.790> planning<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.180> do<00:01:30.329> all

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
trick which he was planning to do all

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.770 
trick which he was planning to do all
along<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.710> really<00:01:32.280> don't<00:01:32.640> like<00:01:32.880> Rotom<00:01:33.450> because

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
along I really don't like Rotom because

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.200 
along I really don't like Rotom because
this<00:01:34.020> Rotom<00:01:34.829> Rotom<00:01:35.189> I<00:01:35.220> don't<00:01:35.460> know<00:01:35.520> because<00:01:36.060> it

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
this Rotom Rotom I don't know because it

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.969 
this Rotom Rotom I don't know because it
just<00:01:36.570> like<00:01:36.810> has<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.259> can<00:01:37.409> do<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.560> bunch<00:01:37.860> of

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
just like has it can do a bunch of

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.890 
just like has it can do a bunch of
different<00:01:38.070> stuff<00:01:38.579> like<00:01:38.759> depending<00:01:39.689> on<00:01:39.780> which

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
different stuff like depending on which

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.380

not<00:03:54.590> really<00:03:54.860> sure<00:03:55.220> why<00:03:56.060> I<00:03:56.090> kept<00:03:56.510> that<00:03:56.570> tangela

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
not really sure why I kept that tangela

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.030 
not really sure why I kept that tangela
in<00:03:57.260> uh<00:03:57.590> I<00:03:58.460> don't<00:03:59.030> know<00:03:59.300> so<00:04:00.200> oh<00:04:00.380> there<00:04:00.620> it<00:04:00.710> is<00:04:00.860> I

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
in uh I don't know so oh there it is I

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.650 
in uh I don't know so oh there it is I
use<00:04:01.220> a<00:04:01.400> tangler<00:04:01.820> can<00:04:01.940> use<00:04:02.060> sleep<00:04:02.300> powder<00:04:02.480> I

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
use a tangler can use sleep powder I

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.590 
use a tangler can use sleep powder I
guess<00:04:02.900> I<00:04:03.020> knew<00:04:03.230> he<00:04:03.380> was<00:04:03.500> gonna<00:04:03.620> live<00:04:03.950> a<00:04:04.600> flare

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
guess I knew he was gonna live a flare

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.510 
guess I knew he was gonna live a flare
blitz<00:04:05.750> and<00:04:05.960> I<00:04:06.020> was<00:04:06.140> banking<00:04:06.380> on<00:04:06.650> him<00:04:06.830> surviving

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 
blitz and I was banking on him surviving

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.690 
blitz and I was banking on him surviving
and<00:04:07.940> hitting<00:04:08.780> with<00:04:08.900> a<00:04:08.930> sleep<00:04:09.230> powder<00:04:09.440> even<00:04:10.430> so

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
and hitting with a sleep powder even so

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:11.830 
and hitting with a sleep powder even so
that's<00:04:10.850> kind<00:04:11.120> of<00:04:11.180> a<00:04:11.270> questionable<00:04:11.750> move

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
that's kind of a questionable move

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.330 
that's kind of a questionable move
because<00:04:12.200> if<00:04:12.290> you'd<00:04:12.410> switch<00:04:12.710> that<00:04:12.890> ember<00:04:13.190> up

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
because if you'd switch that ember up

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.310 
because if you'd switch that ember up
then<00:04:13.820> I<00:04:13.850> can't<00:04:14.150> really<00:04:14.300> put<00:04:14.840> any<00:04:14.960> of<00:04:15.140> his<00:04:15.230> other

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
then I can't really put any of his other

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.500 
then I can't really put any of his other
Pokemon<00:04:15.770> asleep<00:04:16.040> was<00:04:16.160> a<00:04:16.190> sleep<00:04:16.489> clause<00:04:16.700> and<00:04:16.940> I

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
Pokemon asleep was a sleep clause and I

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.210 
Pokemon asleep was a sleep clause and I
might<00:04:17.989> want<00:04:18.020> to<00:04:18.290> save<00:04:18.500> this<00:04:18.650> tangler<00:04:19.040> for

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
might want to save this tangler for

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.600 
might want to save this tangler for
later<00:04:19.400> anyway<00:04:20.120> so<00:04:20.180> I<00:04:20.359> hit<00:04:20.600> him<00:04:20.690> with<00:04:20.780> a<00:04:21.580> with<00:04:22.580> a

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
later anyway so I hit him with a with a

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
later anyway so I hit him with a with a
hidden<00:04:22.820> power<00:04:22.940> that<00:04:23.090> doesn't<00:04:23.270> do<00:04:23.330> much<00:04:23.479> and

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
hidden power that doesn't do much and

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:24.730 
hidden power that doesn't do much and
then<00:04:23.720> I<00:04:23.780> come<00:04:23.960> in<00:04:24.050> with<00:04:24.169> a<00:04:24.229> leech<00:04:24.440> seed<00:04:24.680> and

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
then I come in with a leech seed and

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:25.390 
then I come in with a leech seed and
that<00:04:24.860> does

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
that does

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.770 
that does
more<00:04:25.520> than<00:04:25.729> the<00:04:25.850> hidden<00:04:26.090> I<00:04:26.240> think<00:04:26.509> more<00:04:26.750> than

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
more than the hidden I think more than

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.010 
more than the hidden I think more than
hidden<00:04:27.020> power<00:04:27.350> and<00:04:27.889> I<00:04:28.100> get<00:04:28.250> to<00:04:28.340> heal<00:04:28.580> I

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
hidden power and I get to heal I

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.900 
hidden power and I get to heal I
certainly<00:04:30.020> should<00:04:30.350> have<00:04:30.380> switched<00:04:30.650> out<00:04:31.100> after

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
certainly should have switched out after

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.689 
certainly should have switched out after
that<00:04:32.210> leech<00:04:32.479> seed<00:04:32.750> cuz<00:04:33.530> you<00:04:34.039> can<00:04:34.250> only<00:04:34.400> stay

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
that leech seed cuz you can only stay

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:36.730 
that leech seed cuz you can only stay
asleep<00:04:34.910> for<00:04:35.030> so<00:04:35.300> long<00:04:35.479> and<00:04:35.780> it<00:04:36.500> would<00:04:36.650> have

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
asleep for so long and it would have

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.550 
asleep for so long and it would have
been<00:04:36.830> nice<00:04:36.979> to<00:04:37.220> get<00:04:37.310> that<00:04:37.520> leech<00:04:38.210> seed<00:04:38.560> health

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
been nice to get that leech seed health

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.730 
been nice to get that leech seed health
recover<00:04:40.100> on<00:04:40.509> my<00:04:41.509> marowak<00:04:41.960> which<00:04:42.229> I'm<00:04:42.410> sending

defensive<00:04:46.430> stats<00:04:46.780> but<00:04:47.800> even<00:04:48.800> after<00:04:48.949> this

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
defensive stats but even after this

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.580 
defensive stats but even after this
super<00:04:49.789> power<00:04:49.970> I<00:04:50.270> wonder<00:04:50.660> if<00:04:50.810> it<00:04:50.960> would<00:04:51.470> have

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
super power I wonder if it would have

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.080 
super power I wonder if it would have
lived<00:04:51.800> if<00:04:51.979> I'd<00:04:52.160> gotten<00:04:52.430> the<00:04:52.580> leech<00:04:52.729> seed<00:04:52.940> but

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
lived if I'd gotten the leech seed but

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.029 
lived if I'd gotten the leech seed but
even<00:04:53.270> after<00:04:53.360> even<00:04:54.020> after<00:04:54.289> its<00:04:54.650> awesome

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 
even after even after its awesome

even after even after its awesome
defense<00:04:55.180> super<00:04:56.180> power<00:04:56.360> was<00:04:56.509> gonna<00:04:56.780> take<00:04:57.110> it

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
defense super power was gonna take it

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:00.129 
defense super power was gonna take it
down<00:04:57.470> so<00:04:58.160> now<00:04:58.250> I'm<00:04:58.370> gonna<00:04:58.490> send<00:04:58.850> in<00:04:59.120> he<00:04:59.810> loses

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
based 30 defense but if you give it a

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.550 
based 30 defense but if you give it a
light<00:05:07.669> ball<00:05:07.880> it<00:05:08.060> has<00:05:08.199> monstrous<00:05:09.199> special
