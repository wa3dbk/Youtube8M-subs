okay<00:00:00.810> here's<00:00:01.020> the<00:00:01.079> next<00:00:01.170> step<00:00:02.480> alternate

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
okay here's the next step alternate

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.559 
okay here's the next step alternate
picking<00:00:03.659> pattern<00:00:04.319> number<00:00:04.830> two<00:00:05.040> this<00:00:05.339> time<00:00:05.609> mix

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
picking pattern number two this time mix

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.540 
picking pattern number two this time mix
the<00:00:06.779> fingers<00:00:07.170> up<00:00:07.350> so<00:00:07.710> I'll<00:00:07.830> be<00:00:07.980> playing<00:00:08.130> a

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
the fingers up so I'll be playing a

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.180 
the fingers up so I'll be playing a
minor<00:00:09.200> base<00:00:10.460> index<00:00:11.460> on<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:11.910> g<00:00:12.090> string<00:00:13.190> D

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
minor base index on the g string D

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.020 
minor base index on the g string D
string<00:00:14.219> base<00:00:14.839> middle<00:00:15.839> finger

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:20.030 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:26.380 

so<00:00:20.570> string<00:00:21.730> 5/3

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.570 

then<00:00:26.960> the<00:00:27.170> LOI<00:00:27.320> base<00:00:28.210> back<00:00:29.210> to<00:00:29.390> an<00:00:29.509> index<00:00:30.580> D

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.580 
then the LOI base back to an index D

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.670 
then the LOI base back to an index D
string

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
string

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.759 
string
so<00:00:34.680> it's<00:00:34.829> thumb<00:00:35.100> index<00:00:35.670> thumb<00:00:36.449> middle<00:00:37.050> thumb

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:37.769 
so it's thumb index thumb middle thumb

00:00:37.769 --> 00:01:03.990 
so it's thumb index thumb middle thumb
index<00:00:38.280> top<00:00:38.760> middle<00:00:39.410> nice<00:00:40.410> inside<00:00:40.769> three<00:00:41.070> and

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.260 

if<00:01:05.000> you<00:01:05.089> want<00:01:05.239> to<00:01:05.300> try<00:01:05.449> another<00:01:05.510> quart<00:01:05.990> try<00:01:06.260> see

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
if you want to try another quart try see

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.899 
if you want to try another quart try see
this<00:01:08.270> time<00:01:08.570> make<00:01:09.290> bass<00:01:09.560> strings<00:01:10.550> will<00:01:10.790> be

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
this time make bass strings will be

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:12.760 
this time make bass strings will be
exactly<00:01:11.210> the<00:01:11.420> same<00:01:11.479> where<00:01:12.050> I<00:01:12.080> want<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:12.500> low<00:01:12.740> E

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
exactly the same where I want the low E

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.380 
exactly the same where I want the low E
string<00:01:12.950> I'm<00:01:13.369> going<00:01:13.400> to<00:01:13.550> change<00:01:13.820> the<00:01:14.000> note<00:01:14.150> to<00:01:14.360> a

string I'm going to change the note to a

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:22.649 
string I'm going to change the note to a
G<00:01:14.720> so<00:01:15.500> the<00:01:15.590> bass<00:01:15.740> will<00:01:15.979> go<00:01:16.100> like<00:01:16.280> this

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:36.130 

move<00:01:23.469> it<00:01:23.740> when<00:01:23.950> you<00:01:24.070> need<00:01:24.219> it

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140

it's nice just to miss the old finger so
it<00:01:56.550> might<00:01:56.670> -<00:01:57.180> bass<00:01:57.390> notes

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:18.350 

we'll<00:02:09.390> break<00:02:09.630> ring<00:02:09.959> finger
