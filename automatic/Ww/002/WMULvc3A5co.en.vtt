00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
right here if you don't like that and

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.240 
right here if you don't like that and
you<00:02:39.370> want<00:02:39.580> it<00:02:39.640> to<00:02:39.790> look<00:02:39.910> more<00:02:39.970> like<00:02:40.240> the<00:02:40.600> g<00:02:40.870> one

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250

when<00:02:45.340> you<00:02:45.490> do<00:02:45.670> that<00:02:46.500> but<00:02:47.500> if<00:02:47.770> you<00:02:48.190> look<00:02:48.370> at<00:02:48.550> it

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
when you do that but if you look at it

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.550 
when you do that but if you look at it
like<00:02:48.790> this<00:02:48.850> you<00:02:49.390> can't<00:02:49.900> really<00:02:50.200> even<00:02:50.350> tell<00:02:50.940> but

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
like this you can't really even tell but

this<00:02:55.270> is<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.740> when<00:02:57.240> something<00:02:58.240> I<00:02:58.420> don't<00:02:58.630> know

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
what it's called but whatever so you

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.810 
what it's called but whatever so you
could<00:03:02.410> take<00:03:02.440> that<00:03:02.800> off<00:03:03.040> to<00:03:03.250> make<00:03:03.430> it<00:03:03.610> look<00:03:03.790> more

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
could take that off to make it look more

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.860 
could take that off to make it look more
like<00:03:04.390> the<00:03:04.570> g<00:03:04.840> one<00:03:04.870> but<00:03:05.590> i<00:03:06.360> really<00:03:07.360> like<00:03:07.510> it<00:03:07.720> like

you can see that there you go there are
two<00:06:10.940> little<00:06:11.940> pegs<00:06:13.039> they<00:06:14.039> fit<00:06:14.370> inside<00:06:14.639> those

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
two little pegs they fit inside those

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:20.230 
two little pegs they fit inside those
holes<00:06:15.570> and<00:06:16.460> of<00:06:17.460> course<00:06:17.820> they<00:06:18.300> fit<00:06:18.599> like

this so if you ever wanted to do a
shoulder<00:06:29.400> cannon<00:06:29.760> that's<00:06:30.150> how<00:06:30.360> you<00:06:30.420> do<00:06:30.690> it

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 
shoulder cannon that's how you do it

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:37.910 
shoulder cannon that's how you do it
then<00:06:31.140> you<00:06:31.380> just<00:06:31.620> plug<00:06:32.130> this<00:06:33.740> little<00:06:36.920> thing

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:37.920 
then you just plug this little thing

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.140 
then you just plug this little thing
right<00:06:37.950> there<00:06:38.510> into<00:06:39.510> this<00:06:39.930> hole<00:06:40.260> and<00:06:41.190> then<00:06:41.940> you

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:42.150 
right there into this hole and then you

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.080 
right there into this hole and then you
