00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:07.890
 And then people, my name is Caesar. 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.710
 In this video without issues I'll explain 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.599
 in a simple way is an exercise to 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.150
 you gain some agility in the hand 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.859
 left the bike you usually do 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:24.689
 the ground the chords 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:27.390
 okay as you do it is to be useful 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.500
 exercise is the first step for you is 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.140
 have agility 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.620
 So let's do the first exercise. 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.420
 with simple exercises is the exercise 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:40.100
 1234 so good that your brother make his 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.510
 team about an aid 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.520
 what is the correct positioning of the hand 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.579
 You have to stay like this, your finger. 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.270
 thumb behind the guitar 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:54.480
 this way ensuring it is standing and going 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.699
 to be more or less between the middle finger 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.399
 and the ring finger 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.820
 so it is for you to have this 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.729
 here you can open the four 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.460
 fingers reaching at least four 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.890
 first houses of the guitar because it is so 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.810
 He managed to ride here because I need 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.549
 thumb stay here if you can not 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.270
 reach up my index finger not 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.820
 climbs up 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.000
 if he gets down on the indicator he can 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.400
 ride up 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.430
 the first exercise will be the finger 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:30.840
 indicator on the first rope house mi 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:35.040
 middle finger 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:38.460
 it is in the second rope house my remark 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:42.140
 the index finger and the ring finger on the 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.240
 third house on the rope my little finger 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:49.250
 minimum is in color in the fourth house of the rope 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.250
 my love is going to stay this way 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:02:00.620
 then you put talks have to do this has 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.620
 get in 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.710
 if you realize an hour I went to look 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:10.530
 bed and looks like O opponent is wrong 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:13.740
 So let's learn from this because it was 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:18.060
 just because I put it she puts on 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:20.040
 the finger is it's close to thrash a little 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.390
 before almost five hours until almost 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.459
 up the traffic I put a little 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:29.310
 later and this causes the rope not to 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.590
 on the wood or on the arm of the 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:36.780
 guitar then the best positioning 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:40.140
 for you to make a chord or a solo is 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.250
 you tighten exactly right next to the 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.070
 trapiche 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:49.080
 if you get too close to the stretch 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:51.140
 previous will give that horrible sound 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:59.790
 so let's do an exercise now 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:03:02.760
 Calling like that, you should see. I called. 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.190
 I kept my fingers on it. 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:11.820
 squeezing and it gives me a lot of strength 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:13.769
 Good on the left hand, very well. 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.519
 exercise 1234 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.519
 let's do it 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:36.330

 I liked it and it 's good and sign up for the channel. 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.370
 because this channel is a video channel 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.500
 Less simplified classes but less 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.080
 issues to make it easier to bet 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.810
 you can post many classes to the 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.880
 over the months and I hope that you 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.350
 have liked it now if you want something 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.680

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:00.510
 issues a lot more things is going on 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.180
