to learn how to connect to our friends
computer<00:00:09.059> remotely<00:00:09.450> turn<00:00:10.080> up<00:00:10.200> his<00:00:10.320> volume<00:00:10.380> and

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
computer remotely turn up his volume and

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.830 
computer remotely turn up his volume and
then<00:00:11.400> make<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.730> computer<00:00:12.120> talk<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.540> him<00:00:12.690> and

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
then make the computer talk to him and

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.789 
then make the computer talk to him and
we're<00:00:12.960> all<00:00:13.049> going<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.259> do<00:00:13.380> this<00:00:13.500> through<00:00:13.710> the

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
we're all going to do this through the

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.589 
we're all going to do this through the
terminal<00:00:14.070> utility<00:00:14.730> which<00:00:14.940> comes<00:00:15.150> with<00:00:15.299> every

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
terminal utility which comes with every

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.080 
terminal utility which comes with every
copy<00:00:15.839> of<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.230> Mac<00:00:16.379> OS<00:00:16.490> so<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:17.580> can<00:00:17.850> find

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
copy of the Mac OS so you can find

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.090 
copy of the Mac OS so you can find
terminal<00:00:18.480> by<00:00:18.630> opening<00:00:19.080> up<00:00:19.170> finder<00:00:19.740> we're

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
terminal by opening up finder we're

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.830 
terminal by opening up finder we're
going<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.279> go<00:00:20.340> into<00:00:20.490> applications<00:00:21.270> then

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
going to go into applications then

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.170 
going to go into applications then
utilities<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:22.949> then<00:00:23.580> down<00:00:23.760> here<00:00:23.789> there's

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
utilities and then down here there's

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.269 
utilities and then down here there's
terminal<00:00:24.689> so<00:00:24.930> double<00:00:25.350> click<00:00:25.529> that<00:00:25.560> open<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:26.160> up

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
terminal so double click that open it up

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.390 
terminal so double click that open it up
this<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:26.580> what<00:00:26.609> it<00:00:26.820> looks<00:00:27.000> like<00:00:27.090> so<00:00:28.250> first<00:00:29.250> I'm

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
this is what it looks like so first I'm

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.439 
this is what it looks like so first I'm
going<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.550> start<00:00:29.640> off<00:00:29.789> by<00:00:29.849> explaining<00:00:30.179> how<00:00:30.330> to

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
going to start off by explaining how to

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.060 
going to start off by explaining how to
change<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.840> volume<00:00:30.990> in<00:00:31.380> terminal<00:00:31.740> so<00:00:31.920> this

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
change the volume in terminal so this

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.500 
change the volume in terminal so this
command<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.430> actually<00:00:32.759> done<00:00:32.880> with<00:00:33.030> Apple

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
command is actually done with Apple

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.389 
command is actually done with Apple
script<00:00:33.809> what's<00:00:34.170> great<00:00:34.469> is<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:34.649> can<00:00:34.739> run<00:00:34.980> Apple

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
script what's great is you can run Apple

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.979 
script what's great is you can run Apple
script<00:00:35.700> commands<00:00:36.239> through<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.750> terminal

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
script commands through the terminal

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.780 
script commands through the terminal
which<00:00:37.620> helps<00:00:37.980> while<00:00:38.280> we're<00:00:38.399> connecting<00:00:38.700> to

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
which helps while we're connecting to

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.190 
which helps while we're connecting to
another<00:00:38.879> computer<00:00:39.300> so<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.719> command<00:00:40.050> we're

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
another computer so the command we're

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.190 
another computer so the command we're
going<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.379> type<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.739> this<00:00:41.070> osa<00:00:41.940> script<00:00:42.420> -<00:00:42.870> a

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
going to type is this osa script - a

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.119 
going to type is this osa script - a
single<00:00:44.129> quote<00:00:44.370> set<00:00:44.789> volume<00:00:45.270> 10<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.469> so<00:00:46.860> when<00:00:47.100> I

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
single quote set volume 10 and so when I

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.670 
single quote set volume 10 and so when I
hit<00:00:47.370> if<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.879> notice<00:00:48.120> my<00:00:48.149> volume<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:49.289> about

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
hit if you notice my volume is about

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.279 
hit if you notice my volume is about
halfway<00:00:49.950> right<00:00:50.250> now<00:00:50.399> if<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.670> hit<00:00:50.850> enter<00:00:51.289> my

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
halfway right now if I hit enter my

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.770 
halfway right now if I hit enter my
volume<00:00:52.710> if<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:53.039> try<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.280> change<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.579> volume

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
volume if I try to change the volume

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.720 
volume if I try to change the volume
it's<00:00:54.780> all<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.140> way<00:00:55.260> back<00:00:55.469> out<00:00:55.680> without<00:00:56.399> even

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
it's all the way back out without even

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.430 
it's all the way back out without even
popping<00:00:57.149> up<00:00:57.239> we're<00:00:57.690> doing<00:00:57.809> this<00:00:58.020> because<00:00:58.320> if

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
popping up we're doing this because if

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.020 
popping up we're doing this because if
we<00:00:58.530> make<00:00:58.680> our<00:00:58.890> friend's<00:00:59.219> computer<00:00:59.370> talk<00:00:59.850> to

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030

do<00:01:06.630> in<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.869> terminal<00:01:07.200> which<00:01:07.439> if<00:01:07.650> you're

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
do in the terminal which if you're

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.580 
do in the terminal which if you're
interested<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.340> can<00:01:08.520> check<00:01:08.729> out<00:01:08.850> right<00:01:08.880> here

so now the volume is up we're going to

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.030 
so now the volume is up we're going to
use<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.450> say<00:01:12.720> command<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.530> make<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.799> computer

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.600 
use the say command to make the computer
talk<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.000> do<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:15.330> we<00:01:15.540> can<00:01:15.659> type<00:01:15.900> say<00:01:16.770> hello

default voice is Alex we can actually
change<00:01:30.900> this<00:01:31.110> by<00:01:31.290> adding<00:01:31.470> in<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.710> parameter<00:01:31.979> if

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
change this by adding in a parameter if

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.859

even though there's that error because
technically<00:03:31.790> my<00:03:32.000> account<00:03:32.299> isn't<00:03:32.630> logged<00:03:32.840> in

it<00:03:33.730> still<00:03:34.730> technically<00:03:35.090> works<00:03:35.389> so<00:03:35.690> it<00:03:35.840> just

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
it still technically works so it just

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.379 
it still technically works so it just
set<00:03:36.440> the<00:03:36.560> volume<00:03:36.859> up<00:03:36.980> to<00:03:37.130> ten<00:03:37.310> out<00:03:37.459> of<00:03:37.519> ten<00:03:37.700> so
