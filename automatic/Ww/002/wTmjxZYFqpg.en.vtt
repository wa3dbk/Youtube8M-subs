00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
see how it turns out but I kind of

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:16.939 
see how it turns out but I kind of
thought<00:00:15.990> it<00:00:16.049> was<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.230> pretty<00:00:16.350> original<00:00:16.770> idea

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
thought it was a pretty original idea

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.029 
thought it was a pretty original idea
what<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:17.880> did<00:00:18.060> is<00:00:18.240> we<00:00:18.510> got<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.900> maple<00:00:19.470> donut<00:00:19.830> bar

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.849 
what I did is we got a maple donut bar
it's<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.730> little<00:00:20.939> messed<00:00:21.119> up<00:00:21.270> but<00:00:21.330> it's<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.859> maple

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
it's a little messed up but it's a maple

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.590 
it's a little messed up but it's a maple
bar<00:00:22.890> yucky<00:00:23.279> familiar<00:00:23.699> with<00:00:23.820> but<00:00:24.240> we<00:00:24.359> cut<00:00:24.510> it

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
bar yucky familiar with but we cut it

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.040 
bar yucky familiar with but we cut it
down<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.720> middle<00:00:24.810> so<00:00:25.260> now<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:26.039> becomes

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
down the middle so now it becomes

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.439 
down the middle so now it becomes
