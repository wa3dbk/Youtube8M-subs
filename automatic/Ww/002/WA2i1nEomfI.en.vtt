00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
20s so let's see we're going to get

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.910 
20s so let's see we're going to get
right<00:02:02.280> now<00:02:05.840> your<00:02:06.840> results<00:02:07.320> will<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.710> course

that we encountered with the

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.150 
that we encountered with the
stratosphere<00:03:36.900> is<00:03:37.110> that<00:03:37.350> sometimes<00:03:37.920> the

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
stratosphere is that sometimes the

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.730 
stratosphere is that sometimes the
camera<00:03:38.550> application<00:03:39.170> actually<00:03:40.170> locks<00:03:40.440> up<00:03:40.710> the

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 
camera application actually locks up the

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.430 
camera application actually locks up the
phone<00:03:41.070> so<00:03:41.670> it<00:03:42.000> just<00:03:42.210> happened<00:03:42.600> to<00:03:42.660> us<00:03:42.780> you<00:03:43.410> can

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
phone so it just happened to us you can

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.350 
phone so it just happened to us you can
see<00:03:43.830> that<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.070> complication<00:03:44.820> appears<00:03:45.180> to<00:03:45.300> be

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
see that the complication appears to be

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.270 
see that the complication appears to be
working<00:03:45.630> just<00:03:45.660> fine<00:03:45.960> but<00:03:46.350> when<00:03:46.650> we<00:03:46.770> hit<00:03:47.010> the

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
working just fine but when we hit the

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.220 
working just fine but when we hit the

application on the stratosphere which is
a<00:04:00.210> serious<00:04:00.630> problem<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:01.230> only<00:04:01.560> way<00:04:01.710> to<00:04:01.770> solve

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
a serious problem the only way to solve

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
so what do we like about this funnel

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.319 
so what do we like about this funnel
what<00:04:09.629> do<00:04:09.689> we<00:04:09.840> dislike<00:04:10.319> we<00:04:11.220> are<00:04:11.370> we<00:04:11.519> love<00:04:11.849> the

we love the 4G LTE speeds we don't love
is<00:04:24.449> that<00:04:24.660> the<00:04:24.780> battery<00:04:24.990> life<00:04:25.380> can<00:04:25.590> be<00:04:25.710> rather

our tests with a default battery we were

0.2 0.3 inches of thickness but is well

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.790 
0.2 0.3 inches of thickness but is well
worth<00:05:00.120> the<00:05:00.180> $50<00:05:00.930> in<00:05:01.080> the<00:05:01.169> additional<00:05:01.590> bulk

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800
