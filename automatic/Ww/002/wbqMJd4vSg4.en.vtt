so<00:05:18.169> let's<00:05:18.380> look<00:05:18.500> at<00:05:18.620> the<00:05:18.680> spine<00:05:19.090> now<00:05:20.090> and

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
so let's look at the spine now and

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.390 
so let's look at the spine now and

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 
them and stick them on there because it

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:30.840 
them and stick them on there because it
was<00:05:28.070> looking<00:05:28.190> consistent<00:05:28.520> with<00:05:29.000> our<00:05:29.120> life<00:05:29.300> and
