go through a lot of the features on this

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.580 
go through a lot of the features on this
just<00:00:32.910> by<00:00:33.120> itself<00:00:33.390> they<00:00:33.720> move<00:00:33.930> on<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.320> DJ

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
then move on to Ableton so let's get

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.790 
then move on to Ableton so let's get
some<00:00:41.120> CDJ<00:00:42.120> 400<00:00:42.570> main<00:00:43.050> advantage<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.649> this

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
some CDJ 400 main advantage that this

some CDJ 400 main advantage that this
guy<00:00:43.980> has<00:00:44.219> over<00:00:44.250> something<00:00:45.179> like<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.420> city<00:00:45.600> Joe

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
guy has over something like the city Joe

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:53.709 
guy has over something like the city Joe
200<00:00:46.199> is<00:00:46.679> the<00:00:47.039> scratch<00:00:47.219> planner<00:00:51.559> you<00:00:52.559> ready

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
200 is the scratch planner you ready

00:00:53.719 --> 00:01:08.190 
200 is the scratch planner you ready
just<00:00:54.719> like<00:00:54.839> a<00:00:54.870> city<00:00:59.269> roller

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:16.120 

attention<00:01:09.200> on<00:01:09.290> me<00:01:09.409> which<00:01:09.619> was<00:01:14.830> just<00:01:15.830> always

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
attention on me which was just always

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.649 
attention on me which was just always
you<00:01:16.369> in<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:16.610> platter<00:01:16.850> for<00:01:17.060> the<00:01:17.180> effect<00:01:17.450> so<00:01:17.600> you

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
you in the platter for the effect so you

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:19.179 
you in the platter for the effect so you
pick<00:01:17.899> the<00:01:18.049> effect<00:01:18.320> then<00:01:18.649> you<00:01:18.740> just<00:01:18.890> use<00:01:19.039> the

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
pick the effect then you just use the

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:21.219 
pick the effect then you just use the
platypus<00:01:19.640> you<00:01:20.090> know<00:01:20.210> in<00:01:20.390> a<00:01:20.509> while<00:01:20.840> which<00:01:21.140> is

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
platypus you know in a while which is

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:29.289 
platypus you know in a while which is
like<00:01:21.380> a<00:01:21.409> high-pass<00:01:21.979> and<00:01:22.280> low-pass<00:01:22.399> filter<00:01:28.299> the

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
like a high-pass and low-pass filter the

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:31.300 
like a high-pass and low-pass filter the
other<00:01:29.390> cool<00:01:29.630> thing<00:01:29.659> that<00:01:29.929> the<00:01:30.020> CDJ<00:01:30.380> 400<00:01:30.890> has<00:01:31.039> is

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
other cool thing that the CDJ 400 has is

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.130 
other cool thing that the CDJ 400 has is
the<00:01:31.670> capabilities<00:01:32.270> of<00:01:32.360> doing<00:01:32.509> automatic

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
the capabilities of doing automatic

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.440 
the capabilities of doing automatic
loops<00:01:33.409> so<00:01:34.159> when<00:01:34.610> you're<00:01:34.729> if<00:01:35.000> you<00:01:35.149> have<00:01:35.240> a<00:01:35.299> look

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
loops so when you're if you have a look

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.990 
loops so when you're if you have a look
on<00:01:35.570> here<00:01:35.780> you<00:01:36.140> can<00:01:36.259> see<00:01:36.439> it<00:01:36.530> on<00:01:36.649> the<00:01:36.740> screen<00:01:37.000> if

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
on here you can see it on the screen if

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.100 
on here you can see it on the screen if
you<00:01:38.060> guys<00:01:38.209> want<00:01:38.420> to<00:01:38.479> come<00:01:38.600> up<00:01:38.750> and<00:01:38.840> actually

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
you guys want to come up and actually

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.260 
you guys want to come up and actually
have<00:01:39.380> a<00:01:39.409> look<00:01:39.619> at<00:01:39.709> it<00:01:39.740> there's<00:01:40.250> a<00:01:40.640> loop

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
have a look at it there's a loop

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.059 
have a look at it there's a loop
increment<00:01:41.450> or<00:01:41.899> going<00:01:42.229> in<00:01:42.470> there's<00:01:42.770> a<00:01:42.890> limp

00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:43.069 
increment or going in there's a limp

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:45.520 
increment or going in there's a limp
increment<00:01:43.640> of<00:01:43.729> going<00:01:44.030> out<00:01:44.240> if<00:01:45.170> you<00:01:45.380> never

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
increment of going out if you never

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.199 
increment of going out if you never
always<00:01:45.799> on<00:01:46.130> the<00:01:46.280> money<00:01:46.459> trying<00:01:46.759> to<00:01:46.850> get<00:01:47.000> the<00:01:47.090> in

00:01:47.199 --> 00:01:47.209 
always on the money trying to get the in

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:48.730 
always on the money trying to get the in
and<00:01:47.360> out<00:01:47.450> you<00:01:47.600> can<00:01:47.750> always<00:01:47.810> go<00:01:48.049> into<00:01:48.080> bit<00:01:48.500> loopy

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
and out you can always go into bit loopy

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.219 
and out you can always go into bit loopy
if<00:01:49.310> you<00:01:49.520> press<00:01:49.729> either<00:01:49.970> the<00:01:50.479> minus<00:01:50.840> for<00:01:51.080> the

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
if you press either the minus for the

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.109 
if you press either the minus for the
plus<00:01:51.440> it'll<00:01:51.740> loop<00:01:52.039> one<00:01:52.369> bar<00:01:52.580> so<00:01:52.819> we'll<00:01:52.970> just

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
plus it'll loop one bar so we'll just

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.749 
plus it'll loop one bar so we'll just
take<00:01:53.270> four<00:01:53.959> beats<00:01:54.200> so<00:01:54.830> we'll<00:01:55.280> just<00:01:55.459> do<00:01:55.580> that

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
take four beats so we'll just do that

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:14.710 
take four beats so we'll just do that
now<00:02:01.360> don't<00:02:02.360> think<00:02:02.509> about<00:02:02.659> you<00:02:02.810> can<00:02:02.929> change

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.300 

now<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.780> cool<00:02:15.990> thing<00:02:16.020> about<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.470> CJ<00:02:16.800> 400

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
now the cool thing about the CJ 400

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.950 
now the cool thing about the CJ 400
which<00:02:17.460> i<00:02:17.730> haven't<00:02:17.970> seen<00:02:18.210> on<00:02:18.480> any<00:02:18.750> other

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
which i haven't seen on any other

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.040 
which i haven't seen on any other
effects<00:02:19.410> unit<00:02:19.770> or<00:02:19.920> players<00:02:20.670> usually<00:02:21.450> go<00:02:21.870> do

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
effects unit or players usually go do

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.830 
effects unit or players usually go do
increments<00:02:22.290> of<00:02:23.090> hard<00:02:24.090> so<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.510> will<00:02:24.690> have<00:02:24.720> a

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
increments of hard so you will have a

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.840 
increments of hard so you will have a
half<00:02:25.080> so<00:02:25.740> you<00:02:25.800> don't<00:02:25.950> have<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.070> quarter<00:02:26.310> over

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
half so you don't have a quarter over

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.180 
half so you don't have a quarter over
half<00:02:27.090> or<00:02:27.390> three<00:02:27.630> chords<00:02:27.900> it<00:02:27.960> goes<00:02:28.080> up<00:02:28.230> this

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
half or three chords it goes up this
