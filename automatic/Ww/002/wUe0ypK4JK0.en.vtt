00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:05.790
 hello everyone and welcome to the channel 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.460
 techno 01net you know we like it 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.139
 the automobile when married with the 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.610
 itech 1 and today we are going 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.750
 show the best of the best with a car 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.580
 which is available yet that 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.400
 in the united states is the tesla model 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.570
 is there then jérôme it's incredible 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.580
 hamon we can say it's the car 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.740
 the most high tech in the world so full 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.210
 the first sight is a 100% vehicle 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.890
 electric with all the same 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.050
 extraordinary performances but 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.210
 especially inside it is happiness 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.740
 for geeks there frankly this is the 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.930
 paradise of the dic with screens everywhere 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.980
 a screen instead of the counters already 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.200
 looked at this is the class 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.030
 a giant screen also in the center center 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.530
 who will serve on the ground blade for the 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.550
 navigation for recreation for surfing 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.100
 on the internet etc 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.710
 here we can exactly do a lot of 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.379
 things with and well david nogueira our 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.780
 high tech auto specialist on the chain 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.309
 techno 01net the test and they we 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.309
 say they think of it listen to it 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.160
 actually I tested the tesla model 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.350
 so what is it all 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.030
 simply the best sedan 100% 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.440
 electric so why the best 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.450
 simply already because she has a 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.460
 huge battery at 700 kg of battery 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.780
 integrated into the floor that him 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.330
 provide autonomy that has been 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.980
 regularly measured over 400 km 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.330
 and then that's just a performance 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.830
 pretty amazing is even more 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.430
 incredible in its most 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.520
 powerful 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.710
 the manufacturer announces an acceleration 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.479
 from 0 to 100 km time in just four 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.860
 seconds 4 and then there is what 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.860
 really comb a porsche to the posts 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.490
 so first of all necessarily outside 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.660
 this car is slow but just full 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.330
 the eyes with a lot of small 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.890
 subtleties both racy and then also 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.390
 very discreet 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.130
 because I liked the side for the 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.380
 mechanical part is this suspension 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.030
 pneumatic which offers comfort 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.320
 exceptional because we can adjust the 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.810
 body height which will allow 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.970
 to amortize more or less the vagaries of the 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.619
 road and then the little geek touch that 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.420
 are these door handles that 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.070
 outcrop of the bodywork that 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:12.890
 as soon as it comes unlocks 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:14.420
 car other menus very interesting 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.640
 even essential on this vehicle 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.410
 electric the management part of 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.180
 the autonomy on which we will find 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.800
 a small graph that will tell you if 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.810
 yes or no you have adopted the right 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.010
 driving to successfully achieve his 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.010
 400 km of autonomy 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.720
 inside it's downright 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.900
 festival inevitably we are caught by you 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.940
 see this huge touch screen of 17 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.670
 inches still 43 cm diagonal 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.709
 it's huge and it's from this screen 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.070
 that we will pilot all the functions of 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.989
 the car 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.850
 on the side of the accessible functions 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.040
 found on the top of the screen all 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.510
 the entries related to the multimedia part 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.310
 these cases for example so music 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.900
 necessarily the tesla model s a model 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.250
 premium prestige 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.900
 it must say that mp3 especially 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.760
 from a usb key and that it accesses 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.100
 also to internet radio 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.110
 we will also find the part 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.989
 navigation based on a google system 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.790
 maps the telephony part but also a 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.170
 internet browser a real browser 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.390
 internet that is displayed in 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.370
 very very big on the screen leaves to 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.870
 have a big screen as much optimize 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.220
 space that's what tesla expected in 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.410
 integrating a function that allows 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.670
 split the display into two parts so 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.520
 we will be able, for example, to see 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.140
 google maps and his music or so his 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.090
 music and its internet browser 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.200
 and it's true that ultimately even in the 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.300
 cutting into two parts we have when 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:35.630
 even still enough death passes 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:36.950
 to have good visibility in this 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.019
 dream that I could still touch two 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.519
 drivers cars bic 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.140
 there are still some small dots 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:45.110
 which disappointed me this is the case for example 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.090
 of gps navigation so was based on 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.670
 a google maps system but it goes 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.870
 exclusively via the 3g connection so 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.340
 no integrated mapping 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.560
 it means that if you do not have 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.810
 connection you do not have guiding and 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.340
 then there is also the lack of any full 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.630
 driving aids systems on 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.130
 a sedan so to turn anyway 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.299
 on something over 70,000 euros 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.920
 we can still regret the absence 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:06.620
 driving aids system 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.569
 since for example what makes office 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.790
 of reverse radar here is a camera 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.260
 so certainly it's a hd camera but 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.880
 so she does not even beep beep 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
 approaching a bumper for example 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.669
 to have the dark it will still be necessary 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.350
 pay 500 euros that's right 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:20.000
 unacceptable there is also no 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.900
 cameras that will help us stay 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.400
 in the brief queue techno side there is a 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.470
 beautiful screen but ultimately not much 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.419
 more thing and that's it for this shot 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.020
 on the highest tech car 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.419
 of the world 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.100
 finally he misses almost something 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:35.450
 it is that it rolls alone yeah but 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.789
 in fact it would take a mix of google 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.200
 cars west of tesla it would be there 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:41.030
 I buy right now all the more 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.500
 with all these screens a little all these 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.610
 settings it's not necessarily easy to 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.000
 stay really focused on the 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.350
 conduct 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.300
 yes that's what makes it anyway to a 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.710
 moment look at the road if you 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.419
 want to know more about this summer 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.740
 that's fine we invite you to 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:55.560
 read the full article 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.539
 big folder on 01net the mag in the 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.710
 building in the kiosks the chain 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:01.580
 techno 01net we find ourselves very quickly 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.580
 of course hi to all
