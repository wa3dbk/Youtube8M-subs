00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.160
 I feel like a denim congress 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.210
 modem 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.060

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.949
 so many ladies and gentlemen 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.619
 before going into the thick of things 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.170
 I want to ask you this 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:31.710

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.830
 French 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.489
 no I say that because in fact this and this 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.370
 morning I came by train and so I 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.200
 read the point this is the point this 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.910
 wonderful magazine that a week on 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.610
 two fine reports on either 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.850
 Freemasons either on franÃ§ois hollande 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.290
 so go blanket and I like it better 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.620
 a poll that really left me without 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.660
 voice 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.030
 do you figure that in 2012 they did the 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.100
 balance sheet of the year and good morale 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.280
 French was lower than under 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.280
 occupation 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.870
 you realize they are trying to us 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.610
 to make believe that there is a guy who did 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:16.440
 a survey the occupation is then a little 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.580
 further on the screen all explain finally 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.830
 in the point it is explained 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.450
 that today on a global scale 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.130
 French are supposed to be more 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.380
 pessimistic that the Afghans so I 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.610
 do I want me but how 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.060
 they answered the survey d al gore 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:39.170
 yes it's true sometimes the Taliban 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.760
 we cut the ears good of time in 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.560
 time American soldiers are shooting us 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.600
 above 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.140
 finally I want to live we have when 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.140
 even the button 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.090
 but have to stop taking people 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.260
 for cons what is that which 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.000
 could explain today 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.390
 objectively that the French be 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.390
 also defeatist 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.240
 good at the same time I ask the question 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.110
 but it's purely rhetorical a nasri 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.460
 it's true that right now as for 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.770
 the riot on TV you understand 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.210
 why do we mouth it had a 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.450
 other time I came across sophie 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.740
 before it's the little blonde who has 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.290
 replaced from the street in his show 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.920
 every afternoon jean luc who has us 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.420
 left by the way little parenthesis 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.740
 I find it completely con 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.980
 to stop the drug to die a year 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.980
 after 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.799
 you realize that last thing 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.909
 he heard this guy there on his bed 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:40.650
 hospital is a doctor who 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:42.640
 said he added morphine 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.420
 I come back to sophie before I 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.469
 looked at the summary of the show 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.769
 it was edifying 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:48.640
 she was there hello today in 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.950
 it's a story 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.049
 are you for or against dogs 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.000
 bad guys without muzzle who have rabies 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:56.379
 and who eat forgotten babies in 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.250
 cars by parents who did not 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:59.250
 more room in their freezers 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.700
 and that's supposed to be a show of 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.470
 entertainment 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.730
 in fact I started to get interested in 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.170
 the way in which the media we 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.790
 sway horrors to length of 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.680
 day ago three years ago it goes back 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.980
 a little bit I started with the 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.880
 earthquake in Haiti is subjected 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.760
 earthquake for which he had 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.170
 a tremendous boost of solidarity thanks to 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.880
 haiti the adoption market is in full 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.640
 boom 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:31.100
 after the iphone after the iphone here is the 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.250
 list holds everyone wanted 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.989
 watch 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.489
 I like to get mine he still 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.610
 vibrate position since earthquake 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.610
 Earth 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:53.889
 yes I know it's the star Russell 

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:58.780
 delight in common names in time can we 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:04:02.550
 laugh at everything of course not 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.550
 twenty minutes is not possible
