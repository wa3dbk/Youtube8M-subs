difference<00:05:49.430> is<00:05:49.640> yeah<00:05:50.120> angry<00:05:50.570> needless<00:05:51.050> and

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.410 
difference is yeah angry needless and

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:55.480 
difference is yeah angry needless and
the<00:05:51.980> costs<00:05:52.570> so<00:05:53.570> if<00:05:54.470> you<00:05:54.680> have<00:05:54.860> mines<00:05:55.100> as<00:05:55.250> first

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490
