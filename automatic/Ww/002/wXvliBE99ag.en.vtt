00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
like it's been designed for but it's not

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.710 
like it's been designed for but it's not
letting<00:00:23.980> me<00:00:24.570> some<00:00:25.570> reason<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:27.640> know<00:00:27.820> it's

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.509 
letting me some reason you know it's
always<00:00:28.869> a<00:00:28.960> bummer<00:00:29.260> that<00:00:29.380> you<00:00:29.859> pay<00:00:30.130> so<00:00:30.189> much

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:30.519

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
money for a system and they're just

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.510 
money for a system and they're just
freaks<00:00:33.540> it's<00:00:34.540> always<00:00:34.930> a<00:00:34.960> sad<00:00:35.530> part<00:00:35.860> but<00:00:36.070> enough

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
freaks it's always a sad part but enough

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.680 
freaks it's always a sad part but enough
about<00:00:36.640> that<00:00:37.380> as<00:00:38.380> we<00:00:38.620> give<00:00:38.770> the<00:00:38.800> NBA<00:00:39.130> 2k<00:00:39.610> I<00:00:39.940> try

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
about that as we give the NBA 2k I try

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.280 
about that as we give the NBA 2k I try
to<00:00:40.750> stop<00:00:41.020> the<00:00:41.170> freedom<00:00:41.530> problem<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:43.570> loads<00:00:43.960> for

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 
to stop the freedom problem it loads for

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:53.010 
to stop the freedom problem it loads for
a<00:00:44.320> little<00:00:44.500> while

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:01:12.959 

you<00:00:53.980> get<00:00:54.190> pretty<00:00:54.490> kind<00:00:55.150> of<00:00:55.270> fall<00:00:55.510> into<00:00:55.900> it

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:12.969 

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:15.980 

they<00:01:13.450> said<00:01:13.719> that<00:01:14.020> this<00:01:14.200> is<00:01:14.350> supposed<00:01:14.799> to<00:01:14.890> work

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
they said that this is supposed to work

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:25.039 
they said that this is supposed to work
the<00:01:18.990> lotus<00:01:19.990> seed<00:01:20.259> or<00:01:20.770> like<00:01:20.979> turn<00:01:21.310> up<00:01:21.340> autosave

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:35.969 

to<00:01:26.049> turn<00:01:26.319> that<00:01:26.469> off<00:01:26.679> and<00:01:30.750> yes<00:01:31.750> you<00:01:32.049> put<00:01:34.679> you<00:01:35.679> see

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
to turn that off and yes you put you see

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:57.660 
to turn that off and yes you put you see
that<00:01:36.219> I<00:01:36.250> guess

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.080 

so<00:01:58.210> hopefully<00:01:58.450> that<00:01:58.720> works<00:01:58.900> now<00:01:59.220> just<00:02:00.220> make

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
so hopefully that works now just make

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:10.560 
so hopefully that works now just make
sure<00:02:01.270> it's<00:02:01.900> there<00:02:06.390> okay<00:02:07.390> it's<00:02:07.930> off<00:02:09.270> let's<00:02:10.270> try

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
sure it's there okay it's off let's try

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.240 
sure it's there okay it's off let's try
to<00:02:10.630> see<00:02:10.899> if<00:02:10.929> I<00:02:11.050> can<00:02:11.170> get<00:02:11.320> to<00:02:11.470> a<00:02:11.500> game<00:02:11.770> without<00:02:12.190> a

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
to see if I can get to a game without a

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:24.320 
to see if I can get to a game without a
freezing

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.720 

doubtless<00:02:26.640> so<00:02:29.069> let's<00:02:30.069> see<00:02:30.220> if<00:02:30.340> you<00:02:30.430> can<00:02:30.580> get

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
doubtless so let's see if you can get

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:45.180 
doubtless so let's see if you can get
through<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:32.709> game<00:02:32.950> without<00:02:33.160> freezing<00:02:39.420> I<00:02:44.190> will

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
through the game without freezing I will

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.790 
through the game without freezing I will
be<00:02:45.340> back<00:02:47.160> to<00:02:48.160> have<00:02:48.370> an<00:02:48.519> update
