00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.440 
not perfect you'll have to lift in the
corner<00:01:21.070> because<00:01:21.220> you'll<00:01:21.460> be<00:01:21.670> moving<00:01:22.210> about

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
corner because you'll be moving about

corner because you'll be moving about
and<00:01:22.870> it<00:01:22.990> just<00:01:23.170> won't<00:01:23.440> feel<00:01:23.740> good<00:01:24.010> when<00:01:24.400> you're

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
and it just won't feel good when you're

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.340 
and it just won't feel good when you're
driving<00:01:24.700> in<00:01:24.970> the<00:01:25.000> car<00:01:25.060> really<00:01:25.600> a<00:01:25.720> foreign<00:01:26.110> car

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
driving in the car really a foreign car

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.830 
driving in the car really a foreign car
is<00:01:26.530> like<00:01:26.710> a<00:01:26.740> low-flying<00:01:27.549> aircraft<00:01:27.850> and<00:01:28.659> in

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
is like a low-flying aircraft and in

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.290 
is like a low-flying aircraft and in
fact<00:01:29.020> it<00:01:29.620> generates<00:01:30.040> so<00:01:30.280> much<00:01:30.310> downforce<00:01:30.760> that

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
fact it generates so much downforce that

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.790 
fact it generates so much downforce that
we<00:01:31.540> can<00:01:31.750> invert<00:01:32.650> the<00:01:32.860> road<00:01:33.040> surface<00:01:33.900> at<00:01:34.900> 175

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
we can invert the road surface at 175

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.500 
we can invert the road surface at 175
kilometers<00:01:36.310> now<00:01:36.490> and<00:01:36.670> the<00:01:36.760> car<00:01:37.000> will<00:01:37.210> still

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
kilometers now and the car will still

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.350 
kilometers now and the car will still
stay<00:01:37.810> stuck<00:01:38.650> to<00:01:39.250> at<00:01:39.340> road<00:01:39.550> surface<00:01:39.970> is<00:01:40.000> so

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
stay stuck to at road surface is so

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.510 
stay stuck to at road surface is so
powerful

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.100 

there's<00:01:44.520> about<00:01:44.700> more<00:01:45.329> than<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.539> hundred<00:01:45.840> people
