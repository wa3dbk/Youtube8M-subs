that and you see that now that doesn't

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.159 
that and you see that now that doesn't
necessarily<00:04:24.360> mean<00:04:24.900> anything<00:04:26.720> but<00:04:27.720> let's<00:04:27.960> open

during shipping
that's<00:04:43.230> a<00:04:43.350> guess<00:04:44.030> but<00:04:45.030> maybe<00:04:45.750> the<00:04:46.200> auspicious

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
that's a guess but maybe the auspicious

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.370 
that's a guess but maybe the auspicious
thing<00:04:47.130> is<00:04:47.310> that<00:04:47.550> is<00:04:47.700> that<00:04:47.970> it's<00:04:48.120> in<00:04:48.480> and<00:04:48.780> not

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
thing is that is that it's in and not

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:56.090 
thing is that is that it's in and not
out<00:04:50.419> because<00:04:51.419> this<00:04:51.930> damage<00:04:52.440> was<00:04:52.470> out<00:04:54.890> so<00:04:55.890> let's
