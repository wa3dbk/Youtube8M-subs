00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.799
 hello hannes 350 euro for smartphone 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.200
 Roughly enough, do you have these in? 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.150
 set up your article what get 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.860
 I help it actually So, at first 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.570
 You can basically use the devices 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.519
 Do everything you want with expensive ones 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.619
 You can also do your smartphone 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.269
 you can surf youtube videos 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.000
 watch phone calls sms write 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.070
 anyway and what you get for it 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.850
 hardware are even quad core 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.800
 Processors are pretty good displays 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.559
 Although with few exceptions no hd 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.860
 but still show others 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.050
 pleasant sharpness show the devices all 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.520
 a micro sd card slot with that is 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.559
 you can upgrade the memory with 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.840
 memory cards and then have the 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.070
 Most also have a dual sim slot 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.469
 that means you can sim two cards 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.510
 use at the same time or the devices 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.550
 who can not have that again lte 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.660
 So the fast mobile 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.640
 data transmission 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.080
 that sounds really worth it 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.250
 actually everything in there but somewhere 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.270
 must have had somehow you have to 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.190
 also make maintaining top 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.619
 So if you compare the devices then 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.060
 with devices that maybe 400 500 euro 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.640
 cost or even more 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.410
 then the processors are a lot 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.240
 slower 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.770
 they have less ram what he is 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.750
 crack point even is in comparison 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.640
 to processors speed 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.959
 but you rarely notice the processors 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.910
 at the working memory 

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:29.220
 there are only one gigabyte at one 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.289
 devices and only half a gigabyte in there 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.750
 You can tell that when you're between apps 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:35.099
 changes or an app can start then 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.910
 that sometimes two to three seconds 

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:37.950
 last 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.920
 In addition, the flash memory is right 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.020
 small is 0 4 or 8 gb 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.110
 So you can install a few apps 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.770
 but do not bring up any movies or big ones 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.880
 For example, there could be music collections 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.399
 I think so too if I do not 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.590
 maybe not a little older 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.060
 buy pot or mid-range smartphone 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.920
 Maybe then on the price 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.450
 has fallen or is not 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.200
 good idea 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.539
 basically it is always a lot 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.250
 good idea if you are looking for a new device 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.459
 and do not want to spend that much 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.349
 like leading s6 or an iphone 6 that 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.390
 one then looks how much the first 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.670
 year-round models cost the costs 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.480
 in most cases 20-30% less than on 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.060
 So start at the start of the sale 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.799
 at 150 euro , however, there is no 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.580
 top models more the cheaper 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:25.640
 became 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.370
 they start at 200 250 euro 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.040
 that is the only alternative in 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.290
 this price range are used 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.810
 devices there you will find the turn 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.940
 old lace models but they can 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.890
 not much more than these devices 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.290
 now there were in the test and from the beginning 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.299
 So cheap we know that 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.280
 with the update situation with such devices 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.360
 with cheap devices one could fear 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.079
 that maybe the manufacturers say 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.160
 Okay, let 's say the thing is out there 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:54.290
 is there to expect that one 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.760
 current systems get everything android 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.560
 except for one device I think 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.190
 So all run with a halfway 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.420
 current android 44 most once upon a time 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.940
 even with 5 0 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.640
 the motorola moto ii 1 runs with windows 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.190
 phone 8 1 and the latter two 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:14.450
 namely the moto ii and this windows 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.530
 phone device lumia 532 was that 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.019
 are the only two where 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.090
 probably updates are coming at the 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:21.950
 microsoft device is so when the lumia is 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.989
 the reason that microsoft has announced 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.790
 that all devices with a one gigabyte 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.470
 big memory also an update 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.630
 on windows 10 should get 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.459
 probably in the fall and at the 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.709
 moto ii is the reason simply that 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.810
 Motorola in recent times for his 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.510
 current devices always update delivered 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.190
 has been quite reliable here and there 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.290
 and you therefore at the device too 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.810
 at least with 12 updates left 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.389
 can calculate that is 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.639
 basically you are with the device 450th 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:51.500
 euro or up to 150 euro some were 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:53.329
 yes cheaper served quite well 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.250
 for example if you have a second device or 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:57.709
 Similar searches are less investing 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.269
 well worth it not worth it 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.410
 less invested so there is also 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:04.730
 smartphones for 50 euros already then 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:08.209
 These comfort losses will be the one 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:11.510
 with the 150 euro devices still notes 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:13.489
 bigger that is, it takes a long time to start 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.980
 very long four to five seconds if 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.690
 bad luck the memory is so small 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.220
 that you really just maybe 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.269
 whatsapp or similar install 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.729
 can and then it is over 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.919
 The resolution of the displays are like this 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:26.960
 low that if you are on one 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.060
 website surfs the font normally 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.180
 so can not read but first 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.770
 must search 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.990
 you have visited this again 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.910
 problem that very little writing in one 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.340
 Line fits that means you have to scroll 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.840
 and sometimes zoom the stock too 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.840
 nor because the processors are not fast 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.440
 enough are thus such a device which under 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:49.169
 150 euro far below 150 euro costs so 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.759
 150 euro you should only buy if you 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.130
 anyway, maybe just one 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:53.940
 mobile phone for phone calls and sms 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.280
 write 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.720
 but the devices are enough for that and should be 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.759
 data does not expect that one there 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.410
 a full-fledged smartphone still gets 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:02.910
 you can do everything you want with you 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.800
 can also do more expensive devices 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.800
 ok, thank you
