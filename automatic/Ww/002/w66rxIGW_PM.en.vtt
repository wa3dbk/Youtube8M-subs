hey there folks and welcome the system

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.070 
hey there folks and welcome the system
talk<00:00:02.850> where<00:00:03.090> we<00:00:03.120> review<00:00:03.720> and<00:00:03.870> analyze

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
talk where we review and analyze

talk where we review and analyze
planetary<00:00:04.890> systems<00:00:05.310> in<00:00:05.490> star<00:00:05.730> citizen<00:00:05.970> today

planetary systems in star citizen today

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.930 
planetary systems in star citizen today
we'll<00:00:06.810> take<00:00:06.960> a<00:00:07.020> look<00:00:07.140> at<00:00:07.290> Tara<00:00:07.670> first<00:00:08.670> we'll

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
we'll take a look at Tara first we'll

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.120 
we'll take a look at Tara first we'll
start<00:00:09.090> off<00:00:09.330> by<00:00:09.540> stating<00:00:09.840> what<00:00:10.050> we<00:00:10.170> know<00:00:10.349> then

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
start off by stating what we know then

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.039 
start off by stating what we know then
we'll<00:00:11.309> go<00:00:11.460> into<00:00:11.490> an<00:00:11.820> analysis<00:00:12.059> of<00:00:12.540> how<00:00:12.780> this

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
we'll go into an analysis of how this

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.299 
we'll go into an analysis of how this
could<00:00:13.380> affect<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.740> gameplay<00:00:13.950> in<00:00:14.250> the

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
could affect the gameplay in the

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.369 
could affect the gameplay in the
universe<00:00:14.630> some<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:15.750> it<00:00:15.900> may<00:00:16.020> yet<00:00:16.199> be

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
universe some of it may yet be

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.840 
universe some of it may yet be
speculative<00:00:16.859> but<00:00:17.279> we'll<00:00:17.400> just<00:00:17.430> have<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.760> wait

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
speculative but we'll just have to wait

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.090 
speculative but we'll just have to wait
and<00:00:17.910> see<00:00:19.160> anyhow<00:00:20.160> this<00:00:20.730> is<00:00:20.970> what<00:00:21.180> we<00:00:21.300> know<00:00:21.449> in

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.100 
and see anyhow this is what we know in

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.439 
and see anyhow this is what we know in
the<00:00:23.100> turn<00:00:23.279> system<00:00:23.730> there<00:00:23.880> are<00:00:23.910> four<00:00:24.180> planets

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449

the star is Terra Terra is often

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.109 
the star is Terra Terra is often
considered<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.320> be<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.579> cultural<00:01:32.579> center<00:01:32.610> of

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
considered to be the cultural center of

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.679 
considered to be the cultural center of
the<00:01:33.390> Terran<00:01:33.630> system<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:35.240> Terra<00:01:36.240> relies

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
the Terran system and Terra relies

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.499 
the Terran system and Terra relies
heavily<00:01:36.720> on<00:01:37.259> pike<00:01:37.680> for<00:01:38.490> raw<00:01:38.640> materials<00:01:38.670> and

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
heavily on pike for raw materials and

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.539 
heavily on pike for raw materials and
the<00:01:40.470> reason<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:40.920> needs<00:01:41.100> these<00:01:41.310> raw<00:01:41.520> materials

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
the reason it needs these raw materials

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.280 
the reason it needs these raw materials
is<00:01:42.210> because<00:01:42.509> there's<00:01:42.720> quite<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:43.049> large

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
is because there's quite a large

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.530 
is because there's quite a large
manufacturing<00:01:44.159> base<00:01:44.720> based<00:01:45.720> in<00:01:45.990> Terra<00:01:47.540> the

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
that's over with let's take a look at

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.190 
that's over with let's take a look at
how<00:02:09.330> we<00:02:09.390> might<00:02:09.569> be<00:02:09.629> able<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.869> make<00:02:09.989> some<00:02:10.170> money

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
how we might be able to make some money

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.130 
how we might be able to make some money
in<00:02:10.500> this<00:02:10.649> system<00:02:10.890> on<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:12.360> first<00:02:12.569> planet<00:02:12.780> arrow

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
in this system on the first planet arrow

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.850 
in this system on the first planet arrow
it<00:02:13.440> doesn't

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
it doesn't

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.680 
it doesn't
look<00:02:14.070> like<00:02:14.280> there's<00:02:14.490> any<00:02:14.730> clear<00:02:15.090> means<00:02:15.390> of

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
look like there's any clear means of

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.380 
look like there's any clear means of
making<00:02:15.900> money<00:02:16.490> because<00:02:17.490> it<00:02:17.760> might<00:02:17.880> be<00:02:17.940> rich<00:02:18.210> in

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
making money because it might be rich in

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.420 
making money because it might be rich in
minerals<00:02:18.750> but<00:02:19.020> it's<00:02:19.530> far<00:02:19.830> too<00:02:19.890> close<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.310> the

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
minerals but it's far too close to the

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.800 
minerals but it's far too close to the
Sun<00:02:20.610> so<00:02:20.850> if<00:02:20.910> you<00:02:21.030> land<00:02:21.210> in<00:02:21.360> on<00:02:21.450> it<00:02:21.600> you<00:02:21.690> would

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
Sun so if you land in on it you would

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.510 
Sun so if you land in on it you would
probably<00:02:22.440> die<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:23.010> won't<00:02:23.160> be<00:02:23.250> able<00:02:23.310> to

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
probably die and you won't be able to

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.850 
probably die and you won't be able to
extract<00:02:23.880> any<00:02:24.150> of<00:02:24.300> those<00:02:24.450> minerals<00:02:24.960> maybe

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
extract any of those minerals maybe

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.800 
extract any of those minerals maybe
later<00:02:26.190> in<00:02:26.460> the<00:02:26.580> game<00:02:26.730> they'll<00:02:27.000> be<00:02:27.360> some<00:02:27.660> sort

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
later in the game they'll be some sort

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.590 
later in the game they'll be some sort
of<00:02:27.960> shielding<00:02:28.380> technology<00:02:28.980> that<00:02:29.160> might<00:02:29.280> help

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
of shielding technology that might help

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.820 
of shielding technology that might help
but<00:02:30.600> as<00:02:30.690> far<00:02:30.870> as<00:02:30.930> we<00:02:31.140> know<00:02:31.260> right<00:02:31.410> now<00:02:31.470> there

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
but as far as we know right now there

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.470 
but as far as we know right now there
really<00:02:31.950> isn't<00:02:32.370> any<00:02:32.580> way<00:02:32.790> you<00:02:32.850> can<00:02:33.090> make<00:02:33.270> money

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
really isn't any way you can make money

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.290 
really isn't any way you can make money
on<00:02:33.630> arrow<00:02:34.220> however<00:02:35.220> for<00:02:35.340> pike<00:02:35.880> that's

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
on arrow however for pike that's

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.510 
on arrow however for pike that's
completely<00:02:36.870> different<00:02:37.520> completely

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
completely different completely

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.420 
completely different completely
different<00:02:38.850> game<00:02:39.740> because<00:02:40.740> Pike<00:02:41.040> is<00:02:41.220> one<00:02:41.340> of

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
different game because Pike is one of

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.280 
different game because Pike is one of
the<00:02:41.520> largest<00:02:41.730> manufacturing<00:02:42.570> facility<00:02:43.170> or

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
the largest manufacturing facility or

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.020 
the largest manufacturing facility or
not<00:02:43.470> manufacturing<00:02:44.100> facilities<00:02:44.580> it's<00:02:44.790> one<00:02:44.940> of

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
not manufacturing facilities it's one of

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.090 
not manufacturing facilities it's one of
the<00:02:45.090> largest<00:02:45.390> mining<00:02:46.140> facilities<00:02:46.860> in<00:02:47.010> the

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
the largest mining facilities in the

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.790 
the largest mining facilities in the
entire<00:02:47.340> galaxy<00:02:47.610> it<00:02:48.510> produces<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:48.959> lot<00:02:49.260> a<00:02:49.290> lot<00:02:49.650> of

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
entire galaxy it produces a lot a lot of

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.350 
entire galaxy it produces a lot a lot of
route<00:02:49.950> or<00:02:50.190> that<00:02:50.580> needs<00:02:50.790> to<00:02:50.970> be<00:02:51.090> transported

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
route or that needs to be transported

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.100 
route or that needs to be transported
and<00:02:52.880> because<00:02:53.880> Tara<00:02:54.209> is<00:02:54.420> a<00:02:54.450> manufacturing

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
and because Tara is a manufacturing

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.310 
and because Tara is a manufacturing
facility<00:02:55.290> it<00:02:56.190> uses<00:02:56.489> a<00:02:56.670> lot<00:02:56.880> of<00:02:56.940> horror<00:02:57.300> so<00:02:58.200> if

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
facility it uses a lot of horror so if

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.350 
facility it uses a lot of horror so if
you<00:02:58.410> want<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.650> make<00:02:58.770> a<00:02:59.130> lot<00:02:59.640> of<00:02:59.670> money<00:02:59.940> in<00:03:00.090> short

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
you want to make a lot of money in short

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.310 
you want to make a lot of money in short
duration<00:03:00.750> trips<00:03:01.080> and<00:03:01.350> you're<00:03:01.950> a<00:03:01.980> traitor<00:03:03.320> that

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
duration trips and you're a traitor that

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.199 
duration trips and you're a traitor that
might<00:03:04.500> be<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.680> way<00:03:04.860> to<00:03:04.890> go<00:03:05.040> is<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.580> trade<00:03:06.030> goods

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
might be the way to go is to trade goods

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.199 
might be the way to go is to trade goods
from<00:03:06.510> pike<00:03:06.750> to<00:03:06.959> Tara<00:03:08.030> however<00:03:09.030> that<00:03:09.180> being

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
from pike to Tara however that being

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.860 
from pike to Tara however that being
said<00:03:09.720> if<00:03:09.930> you're<00:03:10.080> a<00:03:10.140> pirate<00:03:10.440> that<00:03:10.980> might<00:03:11.190> be<00:03:11.220> a

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
said if you're a pirate that might be a

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.830 
said if you're a pirate that might be a
good<00:03:12.870> place<00:03:13.170> to<00:03:13.530> how<00:03:14.280> would<00:03:14.459> we<00:03:14.670> say<00:03:14.940> acquire

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
good place to how would we say acquire

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.890 
good place to how would we say acquire
goods<00:03:17.690> because<00:03:18.709> the<00:03:19.820> military<00:03:20.820> forces<00:03:21.209> in<00:03:21.600> the

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
goods because the military forces in the

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.530 
goods because the military forces in the
Terran<00:03:22.290> system<00:03:22.650> seem<00:03:22.890> to<00:03:23.040> be<00:03:23.190> on<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:24.269> fourth

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
Terran system seem to be on the fourth

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.650 
Terran system seem to be on the fourth
planet<00:03:24.810> Jen<00:03:25.549> and<00:03:26.549> that<00:03:26.730> that<00:03:27.209> seems<00:03:27.510> a<00:03:27.630> little

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
planet Jen and that that seems a little

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.740 
planet Jen and that that seems a little
bit<00:03:27.959> a<00:03:28.140> ways<00:03:28.170> away<00:03:28.350> from<00:03:29.030> the<00:03:30.030> trade<00:03:30.480> routes

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
bit a ways away from the trade routes

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.660 
bit a ways away from the trade routes
that<00:03:30.959> would<00:03:31.049> be<00:03:31.170> in<00:03:31.560> between<00:03:31.739> pike<00:03:32.220> and<00:03:32.430> Tara

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
that would be in between pike and Tara

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.850 
that would be in between pike and Tara
so<00:03:33.030> you<00:03:33.780> might<00:03:33.989> actually<00:03:34.170> be<00:03:34.350> able<00:03:34.470> to<00:03:34.709> get

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
so you might actually be able to get

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.460 
so you might actually be able to get
away<00:03:34.950> with<00:03:35.160> that<00:03:35.250> if<00:03:35.400> you're<00:03:35.580> a<00:03:35.610> pirate<00:03:36.470> so

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
away with that if you're a pirate so

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.020 
away with that if you're a pirate so
traders<00:03:38.090> look<00:03:39.090> out<00:03:40.610> another<00:03:41.610> thing<00:03:41.820> you<00:03:41.940> could

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
traders look out another thing you could

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.490 
traders look out another thing you could
do<00:03:42.150> to<00:03:42.180> make<00:03:42.390> money<00:03:42.540> is<00:03:42.840> you<00:03:43.110> could<00:03:43.260> possibly

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
do to make money is you could possibly

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.190 
do to make money is you could possibly
transport<00:03:44.489> manufactured<00:03:45.150> goods<00:03:45.330> from<00:03:45.780> Terra

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
transport manufactured goods from Terra

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.860 
transport manufactured goods from Terra
out<00:03:46.769> of<00:03:47.070> the<00:03:47.190> system<00:03:47.510> however<00:03:48.510> doing<00:03:48.720> that

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
out of the system however doing that

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.110 
out of the system however doing that
would<00:03:49.049> require<00:03:49.230> a<00:03:49.739> ship<00:03:50.130> with<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.400> jump<00:03:51.060> drive

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
would require a ship with the jump drive

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.210 
would require a ship with the jump drive
kind<00:03:51.930> of<00:03:52.019> like<00:03:52.110> the<00:03:52.200> freelancer<00:03:52.709> or<00:03:52.920> maybe

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
kind of like the freelancer or maybe

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.220 
kind of like the freelancer or maybe
something<00:03:53.489> bigger<00:03:53.880> so<00:03:54.690> if<00:03:54.810> you<00:03:54.930> have<00:03:55.049> that

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
something bigger so if you have that

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.449 
something bigger so if you have that
that<00:03:55.470> might<00:03:55.590> be<00:03:55.739> a<00:03:55.799> good<00:03:55.890> way<00:03:55.950> to<00:03:56.100> make<00:03:56.280> money

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
that might be a good way to make money

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.680 
that might be a good way to make money
as<00:03:56.670> well<00:03:57.110> and<00:03:59.299> another<00:04:00.299> way<00:04:00.480> you<00:04:00.540> could

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
as well and another way you could

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.180 
as well and another way you could
possibly<00:04:00.840> make<00:04:01.230> money<00:04:01.470> if<00:04:01.620> you're<00:04:01.739> just<00:04:01.860> into

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
possibly make money if you're just into

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.710 
possibly make money if you're just into
the<00:04:02.220> transport<00:04:02.730> and<00:04:02.850> trade<00:04:03.030> businesses<00:04:03.600> you

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
the transport and trade businesses you

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.210 
the transport and trade businesses you
could<00:04:03.840> transport<00:04:04.260> and<00:04:04.440> trade<00:04:04.620> things<00:04:04.890> in

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
could transport and trade things in

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.820 
could transport and trade things in
between<00:04:05.670> Tara<00:04:06.209> and<00:04:06.420> Jen<00:04:06.780> there<00:04:07.380> may<00:04:07.500> not<00:04:07.650> be<00:04:07.709> a

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
between Tara and Jen there may not be a

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.880 
between Tara and Jen there may not be a
great<00:04:08.280> demand<00:04:08.580> for<00:04:08.850> it<00:04:09.120> but<00:04:09.530> there's<00:04:10.530> always<00:04:10.860> a

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
great demand for it but there's always a

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.990 
great demand for it but there's always a
possibility<00:04:11.090> and<00:04:12.920> I<00:04:13.920> would<00:04:14.400> really<00:04:14.700> doubt

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
possibility and I would really doubt

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.210 
possibility and I would really doubt
that<00:04:15.030> pirates<00:04:15.660> would<00:04:15.810> want<00:04:16.049> to<00:04:16.320> attack<00:04:16.739> you<00:04:16.919> if

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
that pirates would want to attack you if

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.719 
that pirates would want to attack you if
you're<00:04:17.519> going<00:04:17.820> from<00:04:18.090> tara<00:04:18.510> to<00:04:18.720> jen<00:04:18.930> because

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
you're going from tara to jen because

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:21.920 
you're going from tara to jen because
most<00:04:20.729> of<00:04:20.850> the<00:04:20.970> entire<00:04:21.209> military<00:04:21.450> of<00:04:21.900> the

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
most of the entire military of the

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.750 
most of the entire military of the
Terran<00:04:22.260> system<00:04:22.620> is<00:04:22.740> based<00:04:22.950> on<00:04:23.130> Jen<00:04:23.460> so<00:04:23.640> they

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
Terran system is based on Jen so they

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.180 
Terran system is based on Jen so they
would<00:04:23.880> have<00:04:23.910> to<00:04:24.060> be<00:04:24.180> pretty<00:04:24.300> ballsy<00:04:25.050> to<00:04:25.710> attack

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
would have to be pretty ballsy to attack

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.560 
would have to be pretty ballsy to attack
your<00:04:26.340> transport

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
your transport

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.860 
your transport
in<00:04:28.220> space<00:04:29.220> that's<00:04:29.580> covered<00:04:30.270> in<00:04:30.390> military

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
in space that's covered in military

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.810 
in space that's covered in military
vehicles<00:04:31.290> so<00:04:31.740> that's<00:04:32.220> something<00:04:32.490> to<00:04:32.700> take

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
vehicles so that's something to take

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.630 
vehicles so that's something to take
note<00:04:33.060> of<00:04:33.090> as<00:04:33.300> well<00:04:34.040> that's<00:04:35.040> it<00:04:35.190> for<00:04:35.310> my<00:04:35.430> short
