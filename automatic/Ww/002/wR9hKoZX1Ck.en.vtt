00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
megapixel camera and what i noticed with

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.220 
megapixel camera and what i noticed with
it<00:00:44.340> was<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.850> camera<00:00:45.270> was<00:00:45.300> kind<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:46.140> a

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
it was that the camera was kind of in a

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.680 
it was that the camera was kind of in a
low<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:47.100> had<00:00:47.250> this<00:00:47.370> color<00:00:47.820> in<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.210> middle<00:00:48.539> on

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
low you had this color in the middle on

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.369 
low you had this color in the middle on
the<00:00:48.719> back<00:00:49.379> or<00:00:49.680> on<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.160> rear<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.750> mean<00:00:52.199> I

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
the back or on the rear so I mean I

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.650 
the back or on the rear so I mean I
don't<00:00:52.680> really<00:00:52.980> get<00:00:53.399> why<00:00:54.030> they<00:00:54.390> did<00:00:54.629> that

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
don't really get why they did that

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.660 
don't really get why they did that
because<00:00:55.020> usually<00:00:55.559> when<00:00:55.920> you're<00:00:56.100> holding<00:00:56.550> a

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
because usually when you're holding a
