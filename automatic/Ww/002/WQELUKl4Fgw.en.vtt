to<00:00:27.960> answer<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.560> I<00:00:28.890> think<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.130> lot<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.310> people

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
to answer and I think a lot of people

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.679 
to answer and I think a lot of people
are<00:00:29.670> probably<00:00:29.789> gonna<00:00:30.000> agree<00:00:30.210> with<00:00:30.390> me<00:00:30.510> when<00:00:30.539> I

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
are probably gonna agree with me when I

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.979 
are probably gonna agree with me when I
say<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.349> have<00:00:32.070> never<00:00:32.369> had<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:33.300> emotional

and who do you abandon and it's it's the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.590 
and who do you abandon and it's it's the
characters<00:01:30.990> are<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.439> well-crafted<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:33.030> you

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
characters are so well-crafted that you

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.780 
characters are so well-crafted that you
really<00:01:34.200> develop<00:01:34.350> feelings<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.189> attachments

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
really develop feelings and attachments

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.069 
really develop feelings and attachments
for<00:01:35.939> them<00:01:36.030> in<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.210> way<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.780> don't

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
for them in a way that you don't

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.749 
for them in a way that you don't
traditionally<00:01:37.259> do<00:01:37.799> in<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.100> video<00:01:38.340> game<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.610> I

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
traditionally do in a video game and I

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:39.950 
traditionally do in a video game and I
think<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:38.970> lot<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.329> has<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.479> do<00:01:39.720> with<00:01:39.840> the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
think a lot of that has to do with the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.280 
think a lot of that has to do with the
fact<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.890> gameplay<00:01:41.490> is<00:01:41.850> really<00:01:42.290> bogged

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
fact that the gameplay is really bogged

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.340 
fact that the gameplay is really bogged
down<00:01:43.500> in<00:01:44.009> favor<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:45.030> making<00:01:45.689> decisions<00:01:46.079> about

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
down in favor of making decisions about

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.010 
down in favor of making decisions about
the<00:01:46.799> conversations<00:01:47.430> instead<00:01:47.630> yes<00:01:48.630> it's<00:01:48.930> a

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
the conversations instead yes it's a

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.780 
the conversations instead yes it's a
point-and-click<00:01:49.380> game<00:01:49.710> yes<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.430> people<00:01:50.670> have

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
point-and-click game yes and people have

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.039 
point-and-click game yes and people have
criticized<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.450> for<00:01:51.479> just<00:01:51.750> being<00:01:51.930> a

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
criticized it for just being a

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.660 
criticized it for just being a
point-and-click<00:01:52.409> game<00:01:52.770> but<00:01:53.280> I<00:01:53.310> think<00:01:53.579> the

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
point-and-click game but I think the

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.280 
point-and-click game but I think the
whole<00:01:53.759> point<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.299> game<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:55.229> it

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
whole point of the game is that it

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.530 
whole point of the game is that it
really<00:01:55.710> lets<00:01:56.219> you<00:01:56.369> look<00:01:56.729> at<00:01:56.880> yourself<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.420> see

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
really lets you look at yourself and see

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.510 
really lets you look at yourself and see
what<00:01:57.719> kind<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:57.960> decisions<00:01:58.110> would<00:01:58.649> I<00:01:58.710> make<00:01:59.159> and

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
what kind of decisions would I make and

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.010 
what kind of decisions would I make and
one<00:01:59.880> of<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.060> really<00:02:00.240> cool<00:02:00.360> things<00:02:00.540> about<00:02:00.840> the

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
one of the really cool things about the

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.539 
one of the really cool things about the
game<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.290> at<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.500> end<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.680> each<00:02:01.799> episode<00:02:01.979> you

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
who played the game made to kind of

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.320 
who played the game made to kind of
judge<00:02:07.860> yourself<00:02:08.250> against<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.789> community<00:02:09.239> and

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
judge yourself against the community and
