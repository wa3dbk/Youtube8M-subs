00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:10.230
 Hello everyone right now wait there just from 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.749
 vsez expression read rejoice 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.539
 pc-shniki finally accomplished something 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:21.470
 everyone has been waiting for a year to come out again 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:24.510
 computers as a modification for gta 4 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.150
 well, on the other hand, even god pathetic 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.070
 nights trolls more to the point 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.920
 I was here recently in search and search 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.109
 graphic mods on gta 4 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:37.170
 Yes, I still play the fourth squeeze and no 

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:41.489
 it is not connected with the output side fifth well 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.659
 if only very little so here i am 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.539
 came across some entertaining 

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:47.339
 mods for part 4 to my surprise they 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.699
 carry the main chip features 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:52.829
 gameplay from gta 5 to gta 4 dramatically 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.690
 They certainly do not change the game add 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.309
 just some cosmetic stuff 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.929
 which give us the package nickname 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.999
 touch a creature like this 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:02.129
 again and in this video you will see 

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:03.899
 for example, that the potential of 4 parts is far from 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.790
 exhausted in the capable hands of fans with 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.280
 you can do absolutely any game with it 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:12.500
 Although the fashion for the hulk is the same with a person 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:16.140
 waited to prove damn again a lot of pathos 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.000
 must be tied up however immediately recognize 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.950
 that in this regard I had the thought of 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.590
 make fake web video where stated 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.780
 that the new year is now available in the incentive 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.719
 but in fact I would play the fourth part 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.850
 these mods soon had to be abandoned 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:32.009
 from such a venture, so I decided that not all c 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:37.200
 recent video as a joke and will appear 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:38.729
 just one more controversy and yes you are now 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.030
 mint on your screen 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.429
 fake video once left did I could not 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.140
 you would not stand here separately 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:50.810
 can see by clicking on the link under 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:54.179
 video or by clicking here to here here 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:57.509
 then something I started talking 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:02:01.140
 need closer to the topic and so here's the first 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.149
 weapon selection circle as in gta 5 of 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.100
 Pluses can be noted that now 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.409
 it's easier to switch between views 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.420
 weapons not on now scroll all 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.129
 list in search for the gun also claim 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.409
 this circle is available or joystick from 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:16.409
 x-box and with the joystick this mod works 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:18.450
 much better than with a mouse here we come to 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:20.280
 cons of this mod this 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.379
 mouse sensitivity 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.840
 I hope that the creators of this mod are more 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:26.459
 fine-tune the choice of weapons as 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.440
 At first I did not always get 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.390
 choose what I wanted more precisely when I 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.760
 tried to choose what is above 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.860
 below right and left then there did not occur 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.170
 no questions and if i tried 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.590
 choose for example a shotgun and y is 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.310
 a little lower than the left, yes, I understand 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.470
 explain 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.260
 it was really good here 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.450
 try but soon i'm used to subtleties 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.910
 I chose a local weapon and everything became more 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.400
 less normal but more fine debugging 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.319
 sensitivity is still not enough yet 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.330
 those who played are known that once for 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.000
 driving it is now available here in the arsenal 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.800
 for logical reasons with the same mod 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.569
 you can pick up any weapon but 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.819
 you shoot a two-handed you can't 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.510
 will have to switch on the cake holding on 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.910
 in one hand 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.849
 think no need to explain any kind 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:15.269
 weapons apart from these flaws I minus in 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.799
 fashion did not find us further down the course 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.380
 modifications which me most 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.690
 surprised by the fact that so quickly 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.489
 did she add to the game what 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.190
 rockstar so dollars was recited at 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:29.489
 developing a new game their new gta chip 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.340
 this switch between characters yes 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.200
 now it is available in the fourth part 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.299
 if anyone knows something in gta 4 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.200
 there are 3 playable characters 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.890
 niko bellic 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.900
 Jonick Swan and Luis Lopez for the last 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.510
 two can play add-ons 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.459
 idle to myth and for ballad of gay tony 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.930
 accordingly but now it is possible within 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.950
 one game switch between these 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.900
 characters 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.220
 at first adventure everything looks 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.170
 works great 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.760
 first, the characters show up not anyhow 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.709
 where about their homes and when stealing 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.799
 technicians remain in it even after 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:04.859
 restarting the game is of course everything pleases 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:07.170
 but there is one thing but it is connected with 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:09.150
 inventory namely that after the change 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.250
 characters many guns are replaced by 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.260
 alternative for example bits changed to 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.630
 knife quick-fire sniper on 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.030
 several meetings and rocket launchers with grenades 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.829
 generally disappear somewhere it of course 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.930
 can not be called a big shoal given 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.600
 modifications is only a small burr 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.789
 for those who play fair yes I play 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.310
 this without codes without cheats and all that 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:30.990
 and I do not want every time after the change 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.360
 characters run a gun shop for 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.700
 lost trunk another flaw in 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.310
 tom is johnny luis it's not the others 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:41.310
 characters it is not a guise because 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:45.250
 igual all animations remain from nickname even 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:47.780
 hang you can pass with their appearance I 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.159
 [music] 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.080
 I hope that this will correct the apartment 

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:54.120
 do name is mike miss eat 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.849
 supplement yes generally merge together 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.400
 original gta 4 episodes liberty city 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:01.140
 but imagine if they are tired 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.120
 playing for some sort of Russian 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.220
 Mafia will not have to leave the game 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.560
 go to the episodes to wait a long load 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:11.300
 it will be enough to press one button and 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.300
 you can play almost another game 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.680
 Something I dreamed up 3 same modifications 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.980
 no interface makes it like in the fifth 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.570
 part 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.150
 adds the ability to slow down time 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.310
 and the change of characters this mod is also not 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.200
 bring to mind as the previous and all 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.250
 the above works fine only 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.930
 time dilation 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.000
 picture is present only 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:34.000
 health bars of armor and ability 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.710
 Since shifts character quite everything is bad here 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.660
 she looks like a regular teleport in 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.420
 random point on the map without change 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.910
 appearance yes it often transfers you 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.650
 under k it would seem that prevents 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.510
 use the interface because of this mod 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.550
 and the change of characters from the previous one 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.980
 but if so did the effect maybe 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.800
 different or the game just crashes or 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:55.420
 comes an endless slow motion which 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.910
 I did not have time to shoot due to the fact that I play 

00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:00.160
 when minimizing the theft of him or 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:01.960
 switching happens but the game starts 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.060
 strongly slow down and everything will be long 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.910
 in general, I do not advise so 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:09.010
 you can not say that all 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.270
 the above mods are bad in all 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:12.430
 there are pros and cons 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.830
 The first two generally make me happy, but 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.570
 the main thing has been made probably 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.970
 weapons will soon appear 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:20.680
 Techniques characters in gta 5 there is video 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:22.960
 where is the fifth part of gta 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.760
 hid using open 4 if someone is not in 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.620
 the course is a program for opening replacement 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.830
 model editing in engine games 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.960
 gta 4 and so rockstar hurry to 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:34.020
 if you are not a partir leave gta 5 on 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.790
 computers do somebody else 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:39.370
 for with that talent of that speed of work 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:41.710
 under the maker everything is possible I told you that 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:46.630
 these mods appeared these almost a month before 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:47.960
 gta 5 release itself or didn’t say yes 

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:50.180
 exactly said 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.069
 I think there is already enough said by 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.990
 about how to make gta 5 on your computer 

00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:55.819
 share your opinion on what 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.680
 sooner if not official 

00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:59.539
 official release gta 5 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.550
 I personally have no doubt that came out and 

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:05.680
 it is only a matter of time 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:05.680
 Links to fashion in the description of all for now
