00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello hello how are you I hope that very well 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.010
 here Lyon and today I bring you what 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.940
 which is a map yes but not any map 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.400
 since it is 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:17.449
 is based on what the game is for 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.880
 the temple mobiles in rondos ok let's go 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.609
 to see 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.340
 and good here says welcome on time 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:27.430
 the rondo his goal is to run not stop 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:30.669
 until the end of the map and you will earn a 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:33.890
 prize in the rules are that you do not run 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:37.510
 in what are the banks 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.510
 do not stop 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:46.800
 well this map is made by zombie 

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:50.100
 man 2 044 and how good can you look at what 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.920
 what is this your score on what they are 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.109
 posters 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.560
 and well, as you can see it looks very 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:58.750
 very good very long 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:04.150
 the truth obviously I have not arrived until 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:06.860
 the end because if he has his joke ok 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.990
 let's start 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:15.299
 to see if I do not do for there is a fail 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.740
 run run jump jump there says 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:22.979
 10 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:26.670
 I stopped but let's continue 5 if not 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.040
 can be an archer out there to see we're going 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.980
 to try again 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:37.500
 here we go, we run, we run 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.500
 and we jump 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:44.090
 and see you 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:47.810
 to see one more time but 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.500
 let's see if it's easier in third 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.420
 person 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:57.159
 ok and stalin you can you really good 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:01.049
 because he speaks 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.049
 although we run, we run 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:08.820
 without stopping to it now it is no longer 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.569
 good to green this map was very 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:18.140
 well it's now so to pass the 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:20.239
 can even play with more than one 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.849
 and make racing races to see 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.640
 who arrives before or how can they see 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:28.670
 who arrives as far as possible because 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.160
 if it is complicated 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.600
 as it is it was a parkour but to all 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.510
 speed 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.180
 and well I hope you liked it 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.800
 there will be more map reviews and see you 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.920
 until next time 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.920
