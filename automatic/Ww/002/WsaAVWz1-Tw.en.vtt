review of the functionality for the
strata<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.080> like<00:00:19.740> I<00:00:19.830> said<00:00:20.010> it's<00:00:20.250> identical

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
strata and like I said it's identical

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.310 
strata and like I said it's identical
between<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.180> two<00:00:21.330> so<00:00:21.539> what<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:21.810> can<00:00:21.960> do<00:00:22.050> here

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
frame mostly like I said just because it

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.309 
frame mostly like I said just because it
has<00:02:53.349> a<00:02:53.379> much<00:02:54.040> thinner<00:02:54.459> form<00:02:55.000> factor<00:02:55.420> this<00:02:56.109> one

has a much thinner form factor this one

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.640 
has a much thinner form factor this one
here<00:02:56.590> I<00:02:56.739> mentioned<00:02:57.670> how<00:02:58.450> waterproof<00:02:59.379> this<00:02:59.500> one

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
this is the one that will be compromised

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.979 
this is the one that will be compromised
first<00:03:09.549> by<00:03:09.819> water<00:03:10.090> but<00:03:10.390> again<00:03:10.599> if<00:03:10.810> you're

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
first by water but again if you're

first by water but again if you're
looking<00:03:11.200> at<00:03:11.769> it<00:03:11.890> more<00:03:11.980> for<00:03:12.160> just<00:03:12.280> casual<00:03:12.609> wear

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
looking at it more for just casual wear

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.520 
looking at it more for just casual wear
the<00:03:13.329> frames<00:03:13.569> one<00:03:13.810> to<00:03:13.930> go<00:03:14.019> with<00:03:14.730> and<00:03:15.730> if<00:03:15.879> I<00:03:16.530> put

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
the frames one to go with and if I put

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.800 
the frames one to go with and if I put
these<00:03:17.620> up<00:03:17.769> next<00:03:17.950> to<00:03:18.010> each<00:03:18.069> other<00:03:18.190> you<00:03:18.310> can<00:03:18.489> see

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
these up next to each other you can see

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.839 
these up next to each other you can see
real<00:03:19.810> quick<00:03:20.940> how<00:03:21.940> much<00:03:22.269> thinner<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:23.139> frame<00:03:23.380> is

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
real quick how much thinner the frame is

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:30.839 
real quick how much thinner the frame is
if<00:03:24.849> it<00:03:24.970> would<00:03:25.150> just<00:03:25.359> come<00:03:25.660> into<00:03:25.870> focus<00:03:29.849> anyways

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849
