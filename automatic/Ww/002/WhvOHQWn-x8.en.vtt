 it has the appearance of a tomato 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.829
 but it's more than a conceptual tomato an idea of ​​tomatoes 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.940
 the others missing from the meat counter 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.350
 we deliberately pulled a veil 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.350
 an opaque curtain between people and their food 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.060
 the industry do not want you to know the truth about what you 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.110
 eat 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.110

 if we go back up the food chain behind this student in Valais 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.770
 we discover a completely different reality 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.770
 the reality of a factory bassett a farm 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.470
 meat transformed by vast multinationals to light years 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.870

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.680
 food is downright dangerous 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.920
 and we are hiding the intentional truth 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.189
 a handful of multinationals control the system 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.550
 alimentary 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.550
 the supermarket seed and a half our diet 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:12.119
 it's more than just a story 

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:15.129
 our freedom of expression and other rights to health information 

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:18.899
