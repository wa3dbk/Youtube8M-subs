it<00:00:33.450> sounds<00:00:33.930> but<00:00:35.149> but<00:00:36.149> for<00:00:36.750> some<00:00:36.960> reason<00:00:37.380> i<00:00:37.530> show

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
it sounds but but for some reason i show

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.709 
it sounds but but for some reason i show
up<00:00:37.950> flashing<00:00:38.370> on<00:00:38.670> my<00:00:38.850> camera<00:00:39.090> here<00:00:39.420> but<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.690> is

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
up flashing on my camera here but it is

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.290 
up flashing on my camera here but it is
not<00:00:40.020> flashing<00:00:40.710> actually<00:00:41.579> so<00:00:41.790> ignore<00:00:42.149> that

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
not flashing actually so ignore that

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.630 
not flashing actually so ignore that
flashing<00:00:42.840> stuff<00:00:43.140> that's<00:00:44.100> something<00:00:44.430> with<00:00:44.520> the

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
flashing stuff that's something with the

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.540 
flashing stuff that's something with the
camera<00:00:45.000> i<00:00:45.469> think<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.590> front<00:00:46.739> speakers<00:00:47.280> are

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
camera i think the front speakers are

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.360 
camera i think the front speakers are
blown<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.450> radio<00:00:48.750> itself<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.350> cheap<00:00:49.680> so

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
blown and the radio itself is cheap so

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.700 
blown and the radio itself is cheap so
i'm<00:00:50.850> going<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.149> put<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.360> new<00:00:51.510> radio<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.379> and

drip<00:02:09.350> drip<00:02:10.190> drip<00:02:11.000> but<00:02:11.900> once<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.740> weather

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
drip drip drip but once the weather

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.480 
drip drip drip but once the weather
warms<00:02:13.040> up<00:02:13.490> and<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.850> engine<00:02:14.150> warms<00:02:14.480> up<00:02:14.750> it

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
warms up and the engine warms up it

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.220 
warms up and the engine warms up it
slows<00:02:16.490> down<00:02:16.520> and<00:02:17.030> almost<00:02:17.180> completely<00:02:17.900> stops

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
slows down and almost completely stops

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.760 
slows down and almost completely stops
once<00:02:18.590> we<00:02:18.740> get<00:02:18.860> above<00:02:19.070> 40<00:02:19.430> degrees<00:02:20.620> learn<00:02:21.620> that

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
once we get above 40 degrees learn that

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:28.300 
once we get above 40 degrees learn that
though<00:02:22.070> it<00:02:22.190> runs<00:02:22.400> great

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.720 

let's<00:02:29.310> start<00:02:29.670> this<00:02:29.849> thing<00:02:30.120> up<00:02:30.299> ooh<00:02:32.150> low<00:02:33.150> tire

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
let's start this thing up ooh low tire

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.509 
let's start this thing up ooh low tire
yeah<00:02:35.730> we<00:02:35.939> need<00:02:36.060> some<00:02:36.120> air<00:02:36.450> in<00:02:36.569> that<00:02:36.689> thing

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
yeah we need some air in that thing

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.280 
yeah we need some air in that thing
these<00:02:38.519> used<00:02:38.790> to<00:02:38.909> be<00:02:39.000> full<00:02:39.299> of<00:02:39.480> antifreeze<00:02:39.930> but

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
these used to be full of antifreeze but

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.890 
these used to be full of antifreeze but
as<00:02:40.379> you<00:02:40.530> can<00:02:40.680> see<00:02:40.950> it's<00:02:41.069> leaking<00:02:41.519> out<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:42.030> I

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
as you can see it's leaking out and I

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.140 
as you can see it's leaking out and I
think<00:02:43.379> to<00:02:43.920> be<00:02:44.190> honest<00:02:44.430> with<00:02:44.579> you<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.819> reason

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
think to be honest with you the reason

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.839 
think to be honest with you the reason
it's<00:02:45.269> leaking<00:02:45.690> is<00:02:45.840> because<00:02:46.739> these<00:02:47.069> rims<00:02:47.519> are

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
it's leaking is because these rims are

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.789 
it's leaking is because these rims are
just<00:02:48.090> shot<00:02:48.390> they<00:02:48.720> are<00:02:48.870> just<00:02:49.110> rusting<00:02:49.680> and

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
just shot they are just rusting and

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.479 
just shot they are just rusting and
corroding<00:02:50.340> away<00:02:51.110> and<00:02:52.110> all<00:02:52.680> I<00:02:52.709> can<00:02:52.859> think<00:02:53.010> of<00:02:53.340> is

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
corroding away and all I can think of is

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.190 
corroding away and all I can think of is
it's<00:02:53.790> because<00:02:54.150> of<00:02:54.329> the<00:02:54.420> entries<00:02:54.870> because<00:02:55.109> the

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
it's because of the entries because the

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.240 
it's because of the entries because the
front<00:02:55.470> ones<00:02:55.650> are<00:02:55.799> not<00:02:55.980> doing<00:02:56.340> it<00:02:58.069> well<00:02:59.069> it's

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
front ones are not doing it well it's

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.680 
front ones are not doing it well it's
cold<00:02:59.519> and<00:02:59.730> i<00:02:59.790> only<00:03:00.030> got<00:03:00.150> jeans<00:03:00.480> on<00:03:02.299> so<00:03:03.299> my<00:03:03.420> car

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
cold and i only got jeans on so my car

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.069 
cold and i only got jeans on so my car
will<00:03:03.840> be<00:03:03.930> nice<00:03:04.140> and<00:03:04.379> warm<00:03:05.599> one<00:03:06.599> day<00:03:06.780> it'll<00:03:06.930> be

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
will be nice and warm one day it'll be

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:20.500 
will be nice and warm one day it'll be
nice<00:03:07.290> and<00:03:07.319> clean<00:03:12.379> how<00:03:13.379> do<00:03:13.440> those<00:03:13.620> cats<00:03:13.980> do<00:03:14.280> it

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.879 

I'm<00:03:21.510> having<00:03:21.810> a<00:03:21.870> hard<00:03:22.049> time<00:03:22.109> on<00:03:22.379> the<00:03:22.530> camera

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889 
I'm having a hard time on the camera

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:37.809 
I'm having a hard time on the camera
steady<00:03:24.200> alright<00:03:25.200> let's<00:03:25.470> try

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:39.819 

bri<00:03:38.420> meet<00:03:38.629> them<00:03:38.780> and<00:03:38.930> they<00:03:39.049> fire<00:03:39.349> up<00:03:39.560> right

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
bri meet them and they fire up right

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:54.370 
bri meet them and they fire up right
away

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.710 

looks<00:03:54.950> like<00:03:55.160> the<00:03:55.340> belts<00:03:55.700> a<00:03:55.850> little<00:03:56.180> loose<00:03:56.360> but

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
looks like the belts a little loose but

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.130 
looks like the belts a little loose but
not<00:03:56.900> too<00:03:57.110> bad

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
not too bad

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.050 
not too bad
just<00:03:59.680> change<00:03:59.920> the<00:04:00.220> oil<00:04:00.250> on<00:04:00.730> it

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.320 

well<00:04:03.660> as<00:04:03.870> the<00:04:04.110> hydro<00:04:04.830> static<00:04:05.069> fluid<00:04:05.489> that

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
well as the hydro static fluid that

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:14.140 
well as the hydro static fluid that
stiff-necked<00:04:06.720> here

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.090 

the<00:04:14.239> filter<00:04:14.689> under<00:04:15.170> hood

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
the filter under hood

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.730 
the filter under hood
what<00:04:17.610> a<00:04:17.640> fuel<00:04:17.940> filter<00:04:17.970> in<00:04:18.600> an<00:04:18.750> air<00:04:19.110> filter<00:04:19.380> was

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:19.740 
what a fuel filter in an air filter was

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:38.780 
what a fuel filter in an air filter was
good

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.050 

the<00:04:39.120> tower<00:04:39.360> meter<00:04:39.810> was<00:04:40.110> replaced<00:04:40.680> at<00:04:41.060> 5,000

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
the tower meter was replaced at 5,000

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.540 
the tower meter was replaced at 5,000
hours

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.770 

so<00:04:48.060> we're<00:04:48.240> talking<00:04:49.550> 5432<00:04:50.550> hours<00:04:51.120> on<00:04:51.330> the<00:04:51.480> same

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
moods got a lot of wear and tear but

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:20.420 
moods got a lot of wear and tear but
that<00:04:58.590> motor<00:04:58.830> just<00:04:59.220> don't<00:04:59.580> quit

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.510 

yes<00:05:21.060> there<00:05:21.330> are<00:05:21.450> almost<00:05:21.630> 5,500<00:05:22.440> hours<00:05:23.100> on<00:05:23.340> that

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
yes there are almost 5,500 hours on that

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.200 
yes there are almost 5,500 hours on that
old<00:05:23.700> dependable<00:05:23.910> thing<00:05:25.730> it<00:05:26.730> makes<00:05:26.970> some<00:05:27.180> of

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
old dependable thing it makes some of

00:05:27.210 --> 00:06:17.119 
old dependable thing it makes some of
the<00:05:27.360> best<00:05:27.390> little<00:05:27.900> tractors<00:05:28.470> out<00:05:28.650> there

00:06:17.129 --> 00:07:12.030 

to<00:06:17.339> those<00:06:17.669> hydraulics<00:06:18.330> are<00:06:18.509> cold

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:12.040 

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.060
