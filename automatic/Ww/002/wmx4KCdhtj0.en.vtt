lighter<00:01:49.680> as<00:01:49.979> well<00:01:50.159> but<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:51.060> me<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.240> like<00:01:51.479> I<00:01:51.750> like

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
lighter as well but to me I like I like

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.410 
lighter as well but to me I like I like
aluminum<00:01:52.619> because<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.369> like<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.909> feel<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.119> little

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
aluminum because I like to feel a little

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.120 
aluminum because I like to feel a little
bit<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:54.869> flex<00:01:55.229> going<00:01:55.500> into<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.890> turns

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
bit of that flex going into the turns

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.819 
bit of that flex going into the turns
with<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.579> carbon<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.000> don't<00:01:57.240> get<00:01:57.329> that<00:01:57.829> the

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
with the carbon you don't get that the

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.560 
with the carbon you don't get that the
size<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.219> my<00:01:59.340> wheels<00:01:59.549> are<00:01:59.759> 20<00:02:00.119> inch<00:02:00.299> wheels

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
size of my wheels are 20 inch wheels

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.959 
size of my wheels are 20 inch wheels
it's<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.229> rule<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.560> mean<00:02:01.770> it's<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.280> 20<00:02:02.610> inch<00:02:02.729> bike

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
it's a rule I mean it's a 20 inch bike

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.270 
it's a rule I mean it's a 20 inch bike
and<00:02:03.270> everyone<00:02:03.750> has<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:03.930> run<00:02:04.259> 20<00:02:04.740> inch<00:02:04.979> wheels

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
and everyone has to run 20 inch wheels

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.180 
and everyone has to run 20 inch wheels
and<00:02:05.520> there's<00:02:06.270> no<00:02:06.509> other<00:02:06.719> size<00:02:07.619> you<00:02:07.799> can<00:02:07.950> really

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
and there's no other size you can really

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.270 
and there's no other size you can really
run<00:02:08.340> in<00:02:08.550> professional<00:02:09.209> sport<00:02:09.720> on<00:02:10.560> my<00:02:10.800> bike<00:02:11.039> I

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
run in professional sport on my bike I

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.400 
run in professional sport on my bike I
only<00:02:11.459> have<00:02:11.760> one<00:02:12.360> brake<00:02:12.629> and

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
only have one brake and

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.430 
only have one brake and
then<00:02:13.530> we<00:02:13.680> try<00:02:13.890> not<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.220> use<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.700> very<00:02:14.940> much<00:02:15.450> less

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
then we try not to use it very much less

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.460 
then we try not to use it very much less
you<00:02:16.560> use<00:02:16.620> it<00:02:16.980> faster<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:17.340> go<00:02:18.020> this<00:02:19.020> bike<00:02:19.260> only

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
you use it faster you go this bike only

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.490 
you use it faster you go this bike only
has<00:02:19.710> one<00:02:19.950> gear<00:02:20.390> we<00:02:21.390> can<00:02:21.540> always<00:02:21.810> switch<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.350> out

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
has one gear we can always switch it out

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.360 
has one gear we can always switch it out
in<00:02:23.070> between<00:02:23.430> races<00:02:23.610> or<00:02:24.210> between<00:02:24.930> like<00:02:25.370> events

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
in between races or between like events

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.100 
in between races or between like events
and<00:02:26.460> stuff<00:02:26.730> like<00:02:26.880> that<00:02:27.120> but<00:02:27.240> usually<00:02:27.720> we<00:02:27.870> stick

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
and stuff like that but usually we stick

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.030 
and stuff like that but usually we stick
to<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.350> one<00:02:28.560> gear<00:02:29.520> and<00:02:29.550> that's<00:02:29.850> it<00:02:31.040> foot

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
to the one gear and that's it foot

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.100 
to the one gear and that's it foot
pedals<00:02:32.340> are<00:02:32.490> very<00:02:32.670> important<00:02:33.060> for<00:02:33.180> BMX<00:02:33.570> I<00:02:33.930> mean

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
pedals are very important for BMX I mean

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.740 
pedals are very important for BMX I mean
they<00:02:34.290> we<00:02:35.010> clip<00:02:35.250> in<00:02:35.460> and<00:02:35.670> there's<00:02:36.180> just<00:02:36.420> the

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
they we clip in and there's just the

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.780 
they we clip in and there's just the
pressure<00:02:36.990> you<00:02:37.260> put<00:02:37.290> on<00:02:37.740> the<00:02:38.040> pedal<00:02:38.340> I<00:02:38.520> would

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
pressure you put on the pedal I would

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.150 
pressure you put on the pedal I would
say<00:02:39.030> it's<00:02:39.420> 50%<00:02:39.810> more<00:02:40.320> than<00:02:40.530> you<00:02:40.710> would<00:02:40.860> get<00:02:41.010> out

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
say it's 50% more than you would get out

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.130 
say it's 50% more than you would get out
of<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.490> regular<00:02:41.910> flat<00:02:42.180> pedals<00:02:42.540> that<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.960> guys

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
of the regular flat pedals that the guys

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.230 
of the regular flat pedals that the guys
write<00:02:43.500> in<00:02:43.710> the<00:02:43.830> parts<00:02:44.160> or<00:02:44.310> freestyle<00:02:45.030> bikes

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
write in the parts or freestyle bikes

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.510 
write in the parts or freestyle bikes
and<00:02:45.480> that's<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.960> big<00:02:46.110> difference<00:02:46.340> we<00:02:47.340> have<00:02:47.490> a

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
and that's a big difference we have a

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.760 
and that's a big difference we have a
seat<00:02:48.000> but<00:02:48.240> usually<00:02:48.600> we<00:02:48.750> keep<00:02:49.050> it<00:02:49.170> as<00:02:49.290> low<00:02:49.470> as<00:02:49.650> we

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
seat but usually we keep it as low as we

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.680 
seat but usually we keep it as low as we
can<00:02:49.950> so<00:02:50.160> it<00:02:50.280> doesn't<00:02:50.610> bother<00:02:50.700> us<00:02:51.030> because<00:02:51.480> when

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
can so it doesn't bother us because when

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.450 
can so it doesn't bother us because when
we<00:02:51.720> write<00:02:51.990> we<00:02:52.170> have<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.470> stand<00:02:53.130> up<00:02:53.310> because

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
we write we have to stand up because

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.150 
we write we have to stand up because
when<00:02:54.390> we<00:02:54.420> jump<00:02:54.840> or<00:02:55.110> when<00:02:55.410> we<00:02:55.500> go<00:02:55.650> with<00:02:55.800> the<00:02:55.920> jump

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
when we jump or when we go with the jump

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.040 
when we jump or when we go with the jump
suite<00:02:56.340> there's<00:02:56.670> a<00:02:56.760> lot<00:02:56.910> of<00:02:57.060> movement<00:02:57.240> we

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
suite there's a lot of movement we

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.270 
suite there's a lot of movement we
should<00:02:58.200> have<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.410> bend<00:02:58.560> our<00:02:58.680> legs<00:02:58.710> and<00:02:59.100> stuff

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
should have to bend our legs and stuff

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.430 
should have to bend our legs and stuff
like<00:02:59.430> that<00:02:59.640> so<00:02:59.850> we<00:02:59.970> try<00:03:00.150> not<00:03:00.180> to<00:03:00.480> use<00:03:01.140> it<00:03:01.170> and

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
like that so we try not to use it and

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.290 
like that so we try not to use it and
just<00:03:01.650> basically<00:03:01.980> put<00:03:02.550> it<00:03:02.670> as<00:03:02.850> low<00:03:03.030> as<00:03:03.060> you<00:03:03.210> can

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
just basically put it as low as you can

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.870 
just basically put it as low as you can
and<00:03:03.600> get<00:03:03.900> it<00:03:04.020> out<00:03:04.110> of<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.320> way

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
and get it out of the way

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.450 
and get it out of the way
despite<00:03:06.750> every<00:03:07.170> attempt<00:03:07.560> to<00:03:07.650> keep<00:03:07.890> safety<00:03:08.220> at

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
despite every attempt to keep safety at
