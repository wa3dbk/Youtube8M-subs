00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
instance the first time that I saw an

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.260 
instance the first time that I saw an
economic<00:02:21.380> downturn<00:02:21.610> was<00:02:22.610> right<00:02:22.970> after

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
September 11 and that's actually when I

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.040 
September 11 and that's actually when I
started<00:02:25.490> talking<00:02:25.640> to<00:02:25.820> target<00:02:26.330> I<00:02:26.480> realized<00:02:26.960> my

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
started talking to target I realized my

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.450 
started talking to target I realized my
gosh<00:02:27.290> you<00:02:27.530> know<00:02:27.620> I've<00:02:27.740> got<00:02:27.920> this<00:02:28.040> high-end

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
gosh you know I've got this high-end

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.590 
gosh you know I've got this high-end
maturing<00:02:28.880> line<00:02:29.030> but<00:02:29.210> I<00:02:29.240> really<00:02:29.570> need

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
maturing line but I really need

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.630 
maturing line but I really need
something<00:02:30.500> that<00:02:30.620> speaks<00:02:30.770> to<00:02:30.920> more<00:02:31.160> women<00:02:31.490> that

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
something that speaks to more women that

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.190 
something that speaks to more women that
that's<00:02:31.880> more<00:02:32.120> appropriate<00:02:32.210> for<00:02:32.660> these<00:02:32.930> times

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
that's more appropriate for these times

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.230 
that's more appropriate for these times
so<00:02:33.500> that's<00:02:33.920> just<00:02:34.040> one<00:02:34.220> example<00:02:34.340> but<00:02:34.940> I<00:02:35.000> think

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
so that's just one example but I think

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.860 
so that's just one example but I think
ways<00:02:35.750> possibly<00:02:36.380> to<00:02:36.500> set<00:02:36.680> yourself<00:02:36.770> apart

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
ways possibly to set yourself apart

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.360 
ways possibly to set yourself apart
outstanding<00:02:38.870> customer<00:02:39.080> service<00:02:39.380> and<00:02:40.130> people

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
talk about that but I don't know that

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.210
