00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
the SIM slot as you can see the sim

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.979 
the SIM slot as you can see the sim
slides<00:00:57.640> in<00:00:57.789> a<00:00:57.879> certain<00:00:58.180> weight<00:00:59.129> so<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:01.840> want

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
slides in a certain weight so you want

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.920 
slides in a certain weight so you want
the<00:01:02.050> COFF<00:01:02.320> corner<00:01:02.620> that<00:01:02.739> way<00:01:02.890> around<00:01:03.160> and<00:01:03.940> you

the COFF corner that way around and you

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:11.130 
the COFF corner that way around and you
just<00:01:05.199> grab<00:01:05.560> that<00:01:06.869> slide<00:01:07.869> it<00:01:08.049> in<00:01:08.200> and<00:01:10.140> you'll

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
just grab that slide it in and you'll

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.359 
just grab that slide it in and you'll
know<00:01:11.320> when<00:01:11.439> it's<00:01:11.560> located<00:01:11.950> because<00:01:12.100> there's

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
know when it's located because there's

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:15.330 
know when it's located because there's
this<00:01:12.490> little<00:01:13.229> bouncy<00:01:14.229> clipped<00:01:14.740> kind<00:01:15.159> of<00:01:15.250> a

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
this little bouncy clipped kind of a

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.820 
this little bouncy clipped kind of a
spring<00:01:15.700> thing<00:01:16.000> here<00:01:16.330> and<00:01:17.080> what<00:01:17.229> that<00:01:17.380> does<00:01:17.650> is

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
spring thing here and what that does is

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.920 
spring thing here and what that does is
it<00:01:17.950> just<00:01:18.100> returns<00:01:18.340> the<00:01:18.880> semi<00:01:19.329> if<00:01:19.509> you<00:01:19.570> do<00:01:19.750> want

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.359 
it just returns the semi if you do want
to<00:01:19.960> take<00:01:20.110> the<00:01:20.229> SIM<00:01:20.409> card<00:01:20.470> out<00:01:20.829> you<00:01:21.040> are<00:01:21.220> gonna

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
to take the SIM card out you are gonna

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.069 
to take the SIM card out you are gonna
have<00:01:21.579> to<00:01:21.700> push<00:01:21.880> that<00:01:22.060> down<00:01:22.299> to<00:01:22.570> get<00:01:22.720> this<00:01:22.840> SIM

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:23.079 
have to push that down to get this SIM

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:25.109 
have to push that down to get this SIM
card<00:01:23.320> out<00:01:23.470> the<00:01:24.220> best<00:01:24.430> way<00:01:24.549> to<00:01:24.579> do<00:01:24.790> that<00:01:24.939> is<00:01:25.060> just

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
card out the best way to do that is just

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:26.520 
card out the best way to do that is just
to<00:01:25.329> kind<00:01:25.509> of<00:01:25.570> push<00:01:25.720> it<00:01:25.750> down<00:01:26.020> with<00:01:26.049> your<00:01:26.229> nail

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
to kind of push it down with your nail

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.330 
to kind of push it down with your nail
and<00:01:26.850> then<00:01:27.850> push<00:01:28.210> the<00:01:29.079> SIM<00:01:29.619> card<00:01:29.650> out<00:01:30.070> with<00:01:30.220> your

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
and then push the SIM card out with your

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.940 
and then push the SIM card out with your
other<00:01:30.490> finger<00:01:31.079> it's<00:01:32.079> it's<00:01:32.680> a<00:01:32.710> little<00:01:32.829> bit

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
other finger it's it's a little bit

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.069 
other finger it's it's a little bit
tricky<00:01:33.340> but<00:01:33.490> you<00:01:33.610> will<00:01:33.759> get<00:01:33.970> there<00:01:34.180> replace

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:35.079 
tricky but you will get there replace

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:36.899 
tricky but you will get there replace
the<00:01:35.200> battery<00:01:35.350> with<00:01:35.619> a<00:01:35.680> HTC<00:01:36.189> up<00:01:36.399> and<00:01:36.670> you've<00:01:36.759> got

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
the battery with a HTC up and you've got

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.149 
the battery with a HTC up and you've got
a<00:01:36.939> little<00:01:37.060> arrow<00:01:37.299> here<00:01:37.420> saying<00:01:38.380> you<00:01:38.500> know<00:01:38.740> this

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
a little arrow here saying you know this

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:39.899 
a little arrow here saying you know this
way<00:01:39.340> first

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
way first

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.539 
way first
pop<00:01:40.689> it<00:01:40.840> in<00:01:40.960> it<00:01:41.170> will<00:01:41.409> not<00:01:41.680> click<00:01:42.009> or<00:01:42.369> anything

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
pop it in it will not click or anything

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.249 
pop it in it will not click or anything
like<00:01:42.759> that<00:01:42.820> it<00:01:43.060> just<00:01:43.090> slides<00:01:43.479> in<00:01:43.750> and<00:01:43.990> then

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
like that it just slides in and then

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.639 
like that it just slides in and then
just<00:01:45.220> slide<00:01:45.369> that<00:01:45.490> off<00:01:45.640> to<00:01:45.850> lock<00:01:46.060> it<00:01:46.180> in

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
just slide that off to lock it in

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.749 
just slide that off to lock it in
getting<00:01:47.649> this<00:01:47.740> back<00:01:47.979> on<00:01:48.189> is<00:01:48.369> a<00:01:48.399> little<00:01:48.549> bit

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
getting this back on is a little bit

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:50.160 
getting this back on is a little bit
tricky<00:01:49.030> sometimes<00:01:49.180> because<00:01:49.659> there<00:01:49.810> are<00:01:49.930> some

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
tricky sometimes because there are some

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.410 
tricky sometimes because there are some
like<00:01:50.380> stock<00:01:50.710> or<00:01:50.920> carrying<00:01:51.310> grippy<00:01:51.759> things<00:01:52.000> on

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
like stock or carrying grippy things on

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.450 
like stock or carrying grippy things on
the<00:01:52.719> bottom<00:01:52.990> of<00:01:53.049> this<00:01:53.170> particular<00:01:53.350> grip<00:01:53.979> clip

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
the bottom of this particular grip clip
