more<00:00:30.420> on<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.750> ball<00:00:31.070> must<00:00:32.070> remember<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.550> the

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
more on the ball must remember that the

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.610 
more on the ball must remember that the
Swiss<00:00:33.030> ball<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:33.480> definitely<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.320> way<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.469> go

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
Swiss ball is definitely the way to go

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.900 
Swiss ball is definitely the way to go
so<00:00:35.430> what<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.700> do<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.860> couple<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:37.920> ways<00:00:38.520> that

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
so what you do is a couple of ways that

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.930 
so what you do is a couple of ways that
you<00:00:39.270> can<00:00:39.600> do<00:00:39.980> once<00:00:40.980> again<00:00:41.129> it's<00:00:41.489> all<00:00:41.579> about<00:00:41.790> the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
you can do once again it's all about the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.299 
you can do once again it's all about the
rep<00:00:42.120> range<00:00:42.420> so<00:00:43.050> growing<00:00:43.530> there's<00:00:43.800> heavy

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
rep range so growing there's heavy

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.840 
rep range so growing there's heavy
weights<00:00:44.670> low<00:00:45.149> rates<00:00:45.950> toning<00:00:46.950> up<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.399> why

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
weights low rates toning up is why

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.000 
weights low rates toning up is why
weights<00:00:48.120> lots<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.570> bricks<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.559> just<00:00:49.770> grabbed

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
weights lots of bricks so I just grabbed

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.069 
weights lots of bricks so I just grabbed

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
now common mistake that I normally see

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.790 
now common mistake that I normally see
as<00:01:03.770> when<00:01:04.489> people<00:01:04.940> do<00:01:05.059> a<00:01:05.090> chest<00:01:05.420> fly<00:01:05.780> they<00:01:06.530> sort

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
as when people do a chest fly they sort

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.310 
as when people do a chest fly they sort
of<00:01:06.860> take<00:01:07.100> it<00:01:07.250> back<00:01:07.490> like<00:01:08.300> that<00:01:08.600> now<00:01:08.870> what

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320

strain on the ligaments so you want to

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.950 
strain on the ligaments so you want to
keep<00:01:13.010> in<00:01:13.250> mind<00:01:13.520> the<00:01:13.820> chips<00:01:14.120> keep<00:01:14.630> it<00:01:14.750> in<00:01:14.870> your

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.230 
elbow and then just place a link down to

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:28.180 
elbow and then just place a link down to
the<00:01:21.380> back<00:01:21.950> up<00:01:22.130> again<00:01:25.480> keeping<00:01:26.480> it<00:01:26.720> like<00:01:26.870> oxy

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190
