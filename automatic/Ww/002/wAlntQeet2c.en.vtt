00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.859
 I leave you the video of questions and 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.330
 answers that tell them that it is 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.800
 climb the week many weeks ago 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.780
 but because it is that I need 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.700
 coordination I do not know and well now not 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.470
 I come back to answer you these 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.240
 questions of fact now I come to give you 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.980
 more outfits more outfit 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.170
 yes good this time the outfits are 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.330
 the following are like two clarify 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.279
 I'm not me, I'm not a fashion consultant 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.050
 nothing like that just come uita 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.910
 I share what I would use for what 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.800
 would use and so for you if not 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.690
 you have an idea, give yourself an idea and then what 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.130
 that you like what you do not like me 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.290
 I'm really not a power advisor 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.390
 tips like that the stripes like that are going to 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.950
 vergara server fat that the states of 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.750
 are going to be fat and that the lines 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.430
 this way you will be skinnier but 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.350
 nothing else so if you think the advisor 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.969
 fashionable and good clarifying this we can 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.160
 with the video and I 'll give you I'll give you 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.719
 two ideas for you to go to the club and 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.610
 the two ideas are like they call the 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.500
 attention in one way or another I think that 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.570
 each object in signal draws attention 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.550
 are two and well maybe some part two 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.949
 from something lighter something more light to 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.510
 the antrum saw this if they are shirted like this 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.810
 that we started to see for the first 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.329
 trade is already using this 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.490
 with a color is mustard color I'm going to 

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:11.990
 put on this braided belt that is also 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.299
 the same mustard color I will use 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.039
 this shirt that is orange salmon color 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.689
 salmon or something like that and I'm going to double it 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:19.100
 the sleeves because it stays more 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:20.329
 little bit more of style but then I'm 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.799
 half marijuana so do not make me 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:24.320
 very much as long as I talk to you too 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.640
 I'm going to use these blue tennis shoes chinga 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.679
 I do it because the truth is 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.110
 many series does not use anything and then well 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:32.860
 it's what the complete outfit looks like for 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.860
 that you are going to dance 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.040
 for this second option that I am 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.630
 giving me that you can put on ok no 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.010
 you can use this pants that is very 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.930
 similar to the previous one but this is more 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.430
 dark and has as a speck 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.990
 use this without toner or it's going to be 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.119
 the same tone of the shoe and I'm going to 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.009
 put on this shirt that is like gray coffee 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.570

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.610
