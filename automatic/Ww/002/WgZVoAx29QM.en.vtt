00:00:00.929 --> 00:00:03.850
 hi all friends reads luca soundtracks 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.170
 and today I will talk to you about aifon 4 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.520
 outgoing to have it via mail a French directly online arrived 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.389
 already 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.120
 Friday 24th 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.359
 we tried it for a few days 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:19.009
 and now I can show myself 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.189
 its functions 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:23.619
 even the suspect 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:25.699
 comatrol mentality already seen 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:27.300
 here it is 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.999
 here you can see gianco studied absolutely strictly 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.170
 such a croton case 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.720
 we can see it better 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.190
 really 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.060
 a new thing we say that respect and instead the hairdryer 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.050
 notice visa has completely changed 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.000
 now we will compare with iphon 3gs 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.300
 most of you could hold a 3gs in hand here it is 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.390
 and you know very well that from that feeling of being very thin on 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.909
 edges and then reality becomes much more known on the back 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.060
 actually a rip-off time 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.730
 holding in your hand is absolutely one thing. first new cat 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.979
 not bad real tomas a little bit we say to get used to this this 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:22.850
 new shape these new ones 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.560
 finally though 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.740
 make it very, very solid for two 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.300
 front and back glass doors 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.680
 absolutely identical or on the front 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.970
 but we can see from here the distance that exists 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.750
 are 4mm object difference to you then 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.570
 feels q 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.630
 but let's immediately look at it strap world 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.859
 and the difference can be seen immediately, unfortunately I am sorry for the quality of the 

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:54.440
 camcorder though 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.700
 I can assure you that this screen 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.330
 it really makes the difference it seems absolutely another thing 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:02.520
 completely 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.229
 self-building to try nexus two also was already of excellent quality 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.229
 top certainly 3gs but this phone 

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:13.740
 It really is one more thing 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.120
 this that quality 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.359
 the viewing angle is identical from ipad 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:19.290
 self 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.769
 latest generation bokura oats for love 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.689
 quality is something further but also because the resolution of this 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:29.789
 screen 

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:31.840
 to have the difference 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.899
 as we will see later the images are truly extraordinary 

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:39.709
 apple iphone aboard this new aifon 4 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:42.579
 our text 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.549
 really mentioning it 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.379
 comparable for example with the ipad but rather amazed me 

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:52.289
 practically identical 3gs 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:55.439
 so the difference probably does it 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:59.930
 alias ford which was probably optimized for not 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:04.730
 disappoint 3gs fan users who probably bought it from 

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:07.069
 relatively little time 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.959
 but probably in the future we will see implementations as well as 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.439
 pharger the application a little more 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:16.689
 weight if like here ubi 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:22.230
 knowing apple will allow us to use the future for sure 512 

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:23.909
 megabytes of ram a 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.909
 I'm just monstrous on this phone 

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:30.449
 now let's move on 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:34.679
 it has another hardware aspect that has been greatly improved 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.930
 and is located in the back even if there is no other front 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:40.479
 dog 

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:42.329
 the camera 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.709
 strong criticism for a camera 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.979
 by yourself in quotes 5000px 

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:49.660
 it will show you that really 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.079
 is worth 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:53.759
 the quality you have chosen 

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:54.819
 apple 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:57.819
 his I show a screenshot 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:01.089
 mistral you can see 

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:02.500
 aifon 4 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.719
 and to the right the 

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:08.289
 much poorer resolution than aifon 3gs 

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:09.720
 this is the screenshot of 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.639
 of the same photo 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:14.919
 that now I'm going to show more details for the quality 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.309
 analyze 

00:04:19.309 --> 00:04:21.989
 here is the photo re 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.940
 practically identical subject the same same light conditions as the same angle 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.210
 framing or almost 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.259
 but the 7 to understand that the quality we say that to the left and 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:37.479
 but surely it is a higher level now we spam 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:41.960
 this thing surprised me 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:47.300
 not a little it is clear that on the left the photo was taken by a friend notes the 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.249
 former 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:51.760
 lassen megapixel therefore lara 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.999
 the quality is more or less similar as resources 

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:58.419
 but the real color is that 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.409
 finalize 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:03.409
 - our iphone 4 

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:08.270
 study does not see a part that has not been publicized prontissimo brands 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.199
 emiliana cantone 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:14.199
 we talk about the speaker 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.809
 sectioned below our iphone 

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:19.860
 this time the fact that 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.080
 has been 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.659
 drawn practically identical as an oracle of the panda king 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:27.979
 we note 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:31.289
 significant improvement in the quality of audio reproduction 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:34.289
 besides that it has a volume 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:38.389
 rita under the technical aspect for the introduction 

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:43.399
 the are tanit rossiniana lateral part 

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:47.969
 micron mason already been used as you know s 

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:50.969
 in the 3g version in the lawns 

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:54.879
 don't leave more space for the battery 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.449
 I personally cut my sim mormanno 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.710
 reducing it to a microsim 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.410
 this is my test 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.619
 but you can safely 

00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:12.919
 go also in the field of your manager padellata comments 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:15.919
 set up you without any problem. I have to try it 

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:18.240
 as soon as possible 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.689
 and so I did this job 

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:23.809
 no old man reserved and easily 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:28.199
 maybe we go ahead and another novelty 

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:30.979
 the microphone 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:34.479
 this above for noise cancellation 

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:38.289
 so we will have an absolutely better sound quality during 

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:40.129
 phone calls 

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:42.710
 provided that your antenna does not abandon me 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:43.740
 now 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.180
 I laughed at him but actually they were available 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.279
 of anthem 

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:51.499
 this one if you don't want to do it 

00:06:51.499 --> 00:06:53.409
 on the other side 

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:54.860
 land 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.469
 but cellular network 

00:06:56.469 --> 00:06:57.849
 water 

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:02.279
 of state not a few problems when the forms attenuated in this manner 

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:05.309
 and a significant reduction in reception 

00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:08.800
 especially during calls on already you can see 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.430
 an advance but I assure you that during calls as expected modena 

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:13.930
 treviglio around the web 

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:14.919
 if you wrap it 

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:17.909
 zeman these 

00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:20.550
 last considerations then 

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:27.030
 aifon 4 alan great merits but also some non-negligible defects we hope 

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.169
 that they come 

00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:29.539
 accommodated 

00:07:29.539 --> 00:07:32.460
 I hope I didn't take your dreams too far 

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.969
 Meanwhile we are still waiting to write here in Italy 

00:07:36.499 --> 00:07:39.879
 it's all from the geeksphone to the next hello luca
