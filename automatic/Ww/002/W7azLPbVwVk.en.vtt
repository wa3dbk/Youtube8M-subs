00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
off by like energy walls which makes me

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.750 
off by like energy walls which makes me
wonder<00:01:27.240> if<00:01:27.570> they'll<00:01:28.020> be<00:01:28.170> later<00:01:28.470> open<00:01:28.979> data<00:01:29.190> at

another time because behind one of the
energy<00:01:32.880> walls<00:01:33.180> was<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.720> looked<00:01:33.990> like<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.320> bunch

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
energy walls was it looked like a bunch

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.950 
energy walls was it looked like a bunch
of<00:01:34.740> glimmer<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.430> then<00:01:36.240> there<00:01:36.420> was<00:01:36.510> a<00:01:36.570> huge

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
of glimmer and then there was a huge

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.950 
of glimmer and then there was a huge
like<00:01:37.530> door<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:38.310> was<00:01:38.430> blocked<00:01:38.729> off<00:01:39.000> by<00:01:39.330> one<00:01:39.870> of
