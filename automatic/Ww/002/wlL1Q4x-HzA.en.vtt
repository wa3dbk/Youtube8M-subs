I was in the high screen you can right
here<00:01:02.199> I'll<00:01:02.289> go<00:01:02.409> up<00:01:02.940> but<00:01:03.940> mostly<00:01:04.390> if<00:01:04.659> I<00:01:04.780> can<00:01:05.049> I'll

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
here I'll go up but mostly if I can I'll

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:06.630 
here I'll go up but mostly if I can I'll
pull<00:01:05.409> downwards<00:01:05.920> I<00:01:06.070> think<00:01:06.280> I<00:01:06.310> have<00:01:06.460> more

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
pull downwards I think I have more

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.450 
pull downwards I think I have more
control<00:01:06.880> that<00:01:06.970> way<00:01:07.150> the<00:01:08.080> key<00:01:08.350> here<00:01:08.710> is<00:01:08.860> the

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
control that way the key here is the

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.980 
control that way the key here is the
vibrato<00:01:09.760> is<00:01:09.940> not<00:01:10.060> coming<00:01:10.330> from<00:01:10.360> my<00:01:10.570> fingers

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
vibrato is not coming from my fingers

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.990 
vibrato is not coming from my fingers
individually<00:01:11.320> like<00:01:11.800> this<00:01:12.040> it's<00:01:12.490> coming<00:01:12.700> from

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
individually like this it's coming from

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.490 
individually like this it's coming from
my<00:01:13.360> forearm<00:01:15.900> pulling<00:01:16.900> I'm<00:01:17.020> locking<00:01:17.260> these

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
my forearm pulling I'm locking these

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.310 
my forearm pulling I'm locking these
fingers<00:01:17.860> and<00:01:18.010> pulling<00:01:18.700> my<00:01:18.970> arm<00:01:19.300> down<00:01:19.600> my<00:01:19.900> wrist

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
fingers and pulling my arm down my wrist

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:33.679 
fingers and pulling my arm down my wrist
down<00:01:20.530> with<00:01:20.680> my<00:01:20.770> floor<00:01:25.950> right<00:01:26.950> so

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.169 

allowing<00:01:34.689> the<00:01:35.679> string<00:01:36.100> to<00:01:36.520> pull<00:01:36.820> the<00:01:37.000> note

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179 
allowing the string to pull the note

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:39.600 
allowing the string to pull the note
back<00:01:37.659> in<00:01:37.929> tune<00:01:38.229> and<00:01:38.530> I'm<00:01:38.710> pulling<00:01:39.189> it<00:01:39.310> sharp

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
back in tune and I'm pulling it sharp

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.850 
back in tune and I'm pulling it sharp
but<00:01:40.450> the<00:01:41.049> reason<00:01:41.289> why<00:01:41.409> I<00:01:41.439> can<00:01:41.649> get<00:01:41.770> that

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
but the reason why I can get that

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.529 
but the reason why I can get that
control<00:01:42.280> out<00:01:42.490> of<00:01:42.640> it<00:01:42.759> and<00:01:42.969> so<00:01:43.119> I'm<00:01:43.179> using<00:01:43.240> my

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
control out of it and so I'm using my

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:45.419 
control out of it and so I'm using my
forearm<00:01:43.990> not<00:01:44.289> my<00:01:44.500> fingers<00:01:44.859> my<00:01:45.009> forum<00:01:45.310> is

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:45.429 
forearm not my fingers my forum is

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:46.919 
forearm not my fingers my forum is
clearly<00:01:45.670> much<00:01:45.909> stronger<00:01:46.210> than<00:01:46.390> my<00:01:46.539> fingers

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929 
clearly much stronger than my fingers

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:48.809 
clearly much stronger than my fingers
and<00:01:47.409> it's<00:01:47.530> especially<00:01:47.950> prevalent<00:01:48.340> when

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:48.819 
and it's especially prevalent when

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:57.209 
and it's especially prevalent when
you're<00:01:48.969> bending<00:01:49.240> and<00:01:49.539> vibrato<00:01:49.689> in<00:01:50.200> okay<00:01:50.709> so<00:01:56.219> so

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:57.219 
you're bending and vibrato in okay so so

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:58.859 
you're bending and vibrato in okay so so
my<00:01:57.369> second<00:01:57.759> finger<00:01:57.880> in<00:01:58.090> a<00:01:58.119> vibrato<00:01:58.360> was<00:01:58.689> going

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
my second finger in a vibrato was going

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.179 
my second finger in a vibrato was going
to<00:01:58.929> reinforce<00:01:59.380> that<00:01:59.439> finger<00:01:59.829> so<00:01:59.950> I<00:01:59.979> can<00:02:00.100> get

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
to reinforce that finger so I can get

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:05.429 
to reinforce that finger so I can get
some<00:02:00.340> more<00:02:00.429> strength<00:02:00.729> behind<00:02:00.939> it<00:02:04.229> see<00:02:05.229> first

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
some more strength behind it see first

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:06.749 
some more strength behind it see first
here<00:02:05.619> now<00:02:05.979> there's<00:02:06.130> two<00:02:06.250> ways<00:02:06.280> I'll<00:02:06.579> do<00:02:06.670> the

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
here now there's two ways I'll do the

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:08.639 
here now there's two ways I'll do the
first<00:02:06.939> finger<00:02:07.270> vibrato<00:02:07.390> it's<00:02:07.989> um<00:02:08.049> a<00:02:08.110> big<00:02:08.289> early

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
first finger vibrato it's um a big early

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.919 
first finger vibrato it's um a big early

Clapton fan huh kind of stole some of

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.120 
Clapton fan huh kind of stole some of
that<00:02:10.989> from<00:02:11.170> him<00:02:11.319> where<00:02:11.440> I<00:02:11.500> pull<00:02:11.829> the<00:02:11.950> whole

joint right there now here I've done

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.930 
joint right there now here I've done
some<00:02:31.780> pretty<00:02:31.930> mellow<00:02:32.680> vibrato<00:02:33.190> kind<00:02:33.880> of

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
some pretty mellow vibrato kind of

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.840 
some pretty mellow vibrato kind of
medium<00:02:35.310> one<00:02:36.310> thing<00:02:36.400> you<00:02:36.489> might<00:02:36.579> want<00:02:36.790> to

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
medium one thing you might want to

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.509 
medium one thing you might want to
notice<00:02:37.060> that<00:02:37.269> the<00:02:37.600> vibrato<00:02:37.959> is<00:02:38.340> consistent<00:02:39.340> in

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
notice that the vibrato is consistent in

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.599 
notice that the vibrato is consistent in
the<00:02:39.850> interval<00:02:40.239> that<00:02:40.329> I'm<00:02:40.450> bending<00:02:40.720> up<00:02:41.609> you

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:42.609 
the interval that I'm bending up you

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:45.660 
the interval that I'm bending up you
know<00:02:42.700> it's<00:02:43.030> not<00:02:43.150> even<00:02:43.269> a<00:02:43.389> half-step<00:02:44.549> but<00:02:45.549> I'm

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
know it's not even a half-step but I'm

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.110 
know it's not even a half-step but I'm
not<00:02:45.730> going<00:02:46.709> and<00:02:47.709> changing<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.549> pitch<00:02:48.819> of<00:02:49.000> it

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
not going and changing the pitch of it

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.059 
not going and changing the pitch of it
or<00:02:49.239> not<00:02:49.690> keeping<00:02:50.079> it<00:02:50.200> stay<00:02:50.410> it's<00:02:50.620> got<00:02:50.829> to<00:02:51.010> be

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
or not keeping it stay it's got to be

00:02:51.069 --> 00:03:04.450 
or not keeping it stay it's got to be
set

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.100 

right<00:03:05.460> it's<00:03:05.610> always<00:03:05.820> kind<00:03:06.000> of<00:03:06.060> steady<00:03:06.330> pitch<00:03:06.900> I

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
right it's always kind of steady pitch I

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:14.030 
right it's always kind of steady pitch I
could<00:03:07.290> be<00:03:07.350> faster<00:03:12.590> and<00:03:13.590> that's<00:03:13.650> something

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
could be faster and that's something

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.200 
could be faster and that's something
very<00:03:14.130> different<00:03:14.520> then<00:03:15.230> I<00:03:16.730> think<00:03:17.730> I<00:03:17.790> love<00:03:18.000> about

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
very different then I think I love about

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.570 
very different then I think I love about
vibrato<00:03:18.630> is<00:03:18.870> it<00:03:18.960> adds<00:03:19.200> a<00:03:19.410> vocal<00:03:19.800> quality<00:03:20.280> to

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
vibrato is it adds a vocal quality to

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.190 
vibrato is it adds a vocal quality to
your<00:03:20.700> note<00:03:20.910> and<00:03:21.150> that's<00:03:21.450> really<00:03:21.780> I<00:03:21.900> think<00:03:21.960> what

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
your note and that's really I think what

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.330 
your note and that's really I think what
we're<00:03:22.350> going<00:03:22.500> for<00:03:22.650> so<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.310> fast<00:03:23.670> vibrato<00:03:24.170> or<00:03:25.340> a

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
we're going for so a fast vibrato or a

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.010 
we're going for so a fast vibrato or a
slow<00:03:28.730> now<00:03:29.730> what<00:03:29.850> I<00:03:29.880> did<00:03:30.060> there<00:03:30.270> for<00:03:30.660> a<00:03:30.690> seconds

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
slow now what I did there for a seconds

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.960 
slow now what I did there for a seconds
I<00:03:31.080> did<00:03:31.260> a<00:03:31.290> delayed<00:03:31.680> vibrato<00:03:32.130> which<00:03:32.310> I<00:03:32.460> do<00:03:32.520> a<00:03:32.640> lot

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
I did a delayed vibrato which I do a lot

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.090 
I did a delayed vibrato which I do a lot
and<00:03:33.300> I<00:03:33.420> think<00:03:33.480> cuz<00:03:33.810> I<00:03:33.900> got<00:03:34.200> it<00:03:34.320> from<00:03:34.410> singers

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.560 

and<00:03:38.100> then<00:03:38.430> I<00:03:38.520> start<00:03:38.820> bringing<00:03:38.940> in<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.210> vibrato

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
and then I start bringing in the vibrato

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.100 
and then I start bringing in the vibrato
so<00:03:39.720> note<00:03:40.550> wait<00:03:41.930> vibrato

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
so note wait vibrato

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.380 
so note wait vibrato
they<00:03:43.500> can<00:03:43.710> speed<00:03:43.950> it<00:03:43.980> up<00:03:46.820> and<00:03:47.820> you're<00:03:48.060> really

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
they can speed it up and you're really

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.360 
they can speed it up and you're really
good<00:03:48.570> singers<00:03:48.960> do<00:03:49.140> that<00:03:49.350> people<00:03:49.890> have<00:03:50.130> real

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
good singers do that people have real

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.670 
good singers do that people have real
control<00:03:50.610> over<00:03:51.210> their<00:03:51.360> instrument<00:03:51.900> same<00:03:52.470> thing

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:50.449 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:52.700 

now<00:04:51.449> there<00:04:51.599> of<00:04:51.659> course<00:04:51.780> is<00:04:51.960> vibrato<00:04:52.349> with<00:04:52.590> the

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
now there of course is vibrato with the

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.050 
now there of course is vibrato with the
bar<00:04:52.889> but<00:04:53.129> let's<00:04:53.340> just<00:04:53.430> talk<00:04:53.550> about<00:04:53.610> finger

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
bar but let's just talk about finger

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.589 
bar but let's just talk about finger
vibrato<00:04:54.180> for<00:04:54.719> today<00:04:56.270> okay<00:04:57.270> I'm<00:04:57.330> gonna<00:04:57.449> do<00:04:57.569> a

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:57.599 
vibrato for today okay I'm gonna do a

00:04:57.599 --> 00:04:59.540 
vibrato for today okay I'm gonna do a
delayed<00:04:57.990> vibrato<00:04:58.409> and<00:04:58.650> go<00:04:58.770> from<00:04:58.949> smaller<00:04:59.340> to

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
delayed vibrato and go from smaller to

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:05.600 
delayed vibrato and go from smaller to
wider<00:04:59.789> and<00:05:00.060> faster<00:05:03.889> pretty<00:05:04.889> cool<00:05:05.099> right<00:05:05.400> so

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
wider and faster pretty cool right so

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.700 
wider and faster pretty cool right so
it's<00:05:05.759> like<00:05:05.879> a<00:05:05.909> singer<00:05:06.300> could<00:05:06.419> do<00:05:06.629> real<00:05:07.289> control

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
it's like a singer could do real control

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.739 
it's like a singer could do real control
over<00:05:07.949> the<00:05:08.069> note<00:05:08.279> all<00:05:09.180> right<00:05:09.300> so<00:05:09.419> now<00:05:09.509> when<00:05:09.659> you

00:05:09.739 --> 00:05:09.749 
over the note all right so now when you

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:11.839 
over the note all right so now when you
bend<00:05:10.050> and<00:05:10.169> open<00:05:10.379> vibrato<00:05:10.740> it<00:05:10.979> important<00:05:11.819> that

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:11.849 
bend and open vibrato it important that

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:12.980 
bend and open vibrato it important that
you<00:05:11.939> think<00:05:11.999> about<00:05:12.240> is<00:05:12.479> I'm<00:05:12.539> going<00:05:12.629> to<00:05:12.689> Bend<00:05:12.870> up

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
you think about is I'm going to Bend up

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.689 
you think about is I'm going to Bend up
a<00:05:13.080> whole<00:05:13.229> step<00:05:15.919> and<00:05:16.919> I<00:05:16.979> got<00:05:17.099> to<00:05:17.189> hold<00:05:17.310> that<00:05:17.460> band

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 
a whole step and I got to hold that band

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:20.149 
a whole step and I got to hold that band
and<00:05:17.939> then<00:05:18.060> release<00:05:18.479> the<00:05:18.719> note<00:05:18.949> below<00:05:19.949> the

00:05:20.149 --> 00:05:20.159 
and then release the note below the

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:22.070 
and then release the note below the
pitch<00:05:20.400> when<00:05:21.029> we're<00:05:21.150> vibrato<00:05:21.509> a<00:05:21.629> note<00:05:21.930> without

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
pitch when we're vibrato a note without

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.600 
pitch when we're vibrato a note without
bending<00:05:22.560> it<00:05:22.770> we're<00:05:22.889> going<00:05:23.009> above<00:05:23.310> the<00:05:23.430> pitch

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
bending it we're going above the pitch

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:24.950 
bending it we're going above the pitch
now<00:05:23.849> we're<00:05:23.939> going<00:05:24.029> to<00:05:24.090> go<00:05:24.210> below<00:05:24.569> the<00:05:24.779> pitch

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
now we're going to go below the pitch

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:40.760 
now we're going to go below the pitch
and<00:05:25.199> back<00:05:25.319> up<00:05:25.529> to<00:05:25.560> it<00:05:38.599> so<00:05:39.599> you<00:05:40.349> want<00:05:40.529> to<00:05:40.650> think

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
and back up to it so you want to think

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.369 
and back up to it so you want to think
about<00:05:40.889> keeping<00:05:41.279> that<00:05:41.520> note<00:05:41.729> in<00:05:41.879> tune<00:05:42.150> I<00:05:42.449> highly

00:05:43.369 --> 00:05:43.379 
about keeping that note in tune I highly

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:44.899 
about keeping that note in tune I highly
recommend<00:05:43.770> practicing<00:05:44.279> your<00:05:44.400> bends<00:05:44.610> and

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:44.909

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:46.889 
vibrato now in the next installment I'll

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:49.540 
vibrato now in the next installment I'll
be<00:05:46.979> talking<00:05:47.250> about<00:05:47.339> bends<00:05:47.870> but<00:05:48.870> for<00:05:49.050> right<00:05:49.139> now
