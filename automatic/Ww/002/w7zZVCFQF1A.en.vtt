00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.909
 it is everyone knows kaufmann go 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.950
 I hope you are doing well today 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.560
 I present a guide on the Oscar she 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.019
 it's a weapon that has been added with the 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.880
 dsi claude squatters to unlock it 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.759
 you have to make 20 illumination at 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.260
 grenade launcher and 15 elimination at the 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.789
 pomegranate during updates that 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.160
 preceded in Mauritian he leaves because 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.510
 it undergoes a modification at the level of 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.410
 his reload time so that is 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:28.890
 from 2.5 to 2.35 seconds with a 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.660
 non-empty loader and 3 points to 3 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.579
 seconds with an empty charger 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.200
 i never lingered oscars she 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.149
 because on paper these statistics 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.070
 are not attractive compared to 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.350
 other assault weapons if we take by 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.250
 example its rate of 120 tickets 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.469
 for father minutes 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.960
 good is not the weakest of men 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.780
 weakest nation this is the g3 to turn 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.020
 with 550 strokes per minute 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.600
 on the other hand the g3 3 your hui an enemy 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.300
 in three balls while the actual score 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.340
 and under the same model as the rest of the 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.640
 assault weapons so your killing an enemy 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.500
 in four bullets the advantage of the carel 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.140
 I would say that it is first 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.580
 a very precise soul and secondly 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.909
 it is a weapon that is a very weak 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.330
 recoil so that makes a weapon that very 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.290
 very easy to handle especially for 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.299
 beginners 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.330
 hindsight is very very easy to 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.250
 control so for people who 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.930
 start on the game I would like that 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.700
 it's a weapon that's going to be 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.320
 very attractive 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.060
 I was very surprised when I 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.860
 started playing with Oscar she because 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.180
 that when I looked at the statistics 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.600
 compared to other grams of assault 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.340
 there was nothing particular about this side 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.770
 there so the rate of fire that is when 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.500
 even relatively weak good the time of 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.520
 reloading that's okay but that's 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.950
 really at the level 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.520
 I will tell you from hindsight the dispersion 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.070
 bullets this is where the Oscar she goes 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.340
 stand out in terms of accuracy 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.530
 when you shoot at a target the 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.869
 majority of your balls will reach the 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.140
 target so that 's what makes I think the 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.840
 difference and how quickly 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.979
 which you will be able to kill a 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.290
 enemy the m400 16 and a weapon that received 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.569
 also a modification during the pre 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.780
 weapons patch would he have his recoil 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:20.750
 vertical which has been decreased so at this 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.450
 level there the real ska and the m400 are 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.940
 two trees that had vertical receding 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.549
 quite similar is pretty weak 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:32.900
 so the question is why use 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:35.560
 the score is rather than the m 416 well that's 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.959
 back to the reasons I gave you 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.690
 previously so are pulling very very 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.700
 accurate long distance is also a 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.370
 retreat that is even easier to 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.500
 control because of his rate of fire 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.379
 which is weaker so it makes a 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.690
 weapon that will still be very useful 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:55.790
 for beginners on battlefield 3 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.280
 I got the best results in 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.569
 below at the Oscar she with the maker 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.980
 red dots or cobra and the canoe 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:06.829
 legarda man is not needed because 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.569
 that already the vertical recoil is very 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:11.030
 very weak we know that the station tomorrow 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:13.730
 will reduce the vertical decline by 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:17.930
 against will also reduce the accuracy of 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:20.630
 shots when you aim so at this level 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.030
 we want a weapon that will be precise 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:26.000
 long and medium distance 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.220
 distance and its vertical recoil and already 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.760
 so does the gard tomorrow is not 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.349
 necessary on the oscar he the damage of the 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.169
 real cases are standard for a soul 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:39.590
 basso so it's 25 damage up close and 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:42.319
 Ego 18.4 by far so two to five 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.299
 bullets to kill closely and three to seven 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.069
 bullets to kill from afar at the level of the 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:47.329
 discretion as joly says it's a 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:50.900
 situation that is still pretty 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:53.299
 low horizontal and vertical level 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.980
 the oscar she has a shooting mode 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.680
 automatic and piecemeal a 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.169
 velocity of 580 meters per second a 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.260
 rate of fire of 620 rounds per minute 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:05.329
 a reload time of 2.35 with a 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.349
 loader not vd of three seconds with 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:08.299
 a city loader 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:10.549
 the scope is great and chargers 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.849
 contains 30 ball plus a ball in the 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:13.310
 gun 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:15.319
 the oscar she like most souls 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.630
 in battlefield 3 must be used 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.549
 in the right situation and in the 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.769
 good circumstances can be 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.199
 effective in 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.419
 has characteristics that are 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:26.199
 advantageous in this or that 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.259
 situation 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:31.650
 you could think that oscar she is 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:35.319
 a weapon that will only be effective 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:37.470
 long and medium range against I 

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:40.599
 managed to do the right parts on 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.970
 klose curator cards or in match 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:46.259
 to death so it's a soul that's going to be 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:49.900
 still effective you have to be precise 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:51.580
 and your balls as I said with 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.069
 his recoil which is still pretty 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:57.520
 weak most of your balls if you 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:05:01.000
 are accurate are going to hit the target and is going 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.400
 allow you to kill your enemies enough 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.530
 quickly even if you encounter 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.909
 enemies who have weapons with one more 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.680
 high rate of fire 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:10.659
 in the end I would say that the oscar she 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.880
 is a weapon that is very very 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:14.620
 interesting and it's a nice surprise 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.289
 because I had never taken the 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.150
 time really to try it because of 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:21.310
 its features or these 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.870
 statistics that was not 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.509
 necessarily advantageous compared 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.860
 to other assault weapons but it takes 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:29.319
 really try it to understand 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:33.250
 how can it be because it can be effective 

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:35.319
 with its precision and its low recoil 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.270
 really it's a soul that super 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:39.159
 nice to use 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:42.460
 I thank you for listening to the video 

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:44.229
