column to be four and look at this I
just<00:00:25.110> join<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.560> game<00:00:25.740> my<00:00:26.039> team<00:00:26.070> has<00:00:26.610> 76<00:00:27.539> points

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
just join the game my team has 76 points

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.999 
just join the game my team has 76 points
on<00:00:28.260> domination<00:00:29.270> so<00:00:30.270> that<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:30.840> nearly<00:00:31.170> half<00:00:31.800> of

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
on domination so that is nearly half of

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.029 
on domination so that is nearly half of
the<00:00:32.070> game<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:33.260> because<00:00:34.260> donation<00:00:34.680> is

00:00:35.029 --> 00:00:35.039 
the game and because donation is

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:39.169 
the game and because donation is
obviously<00:00:35.520> up<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.789> 200<00:00:36.690> points<00:00:37.850> so<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:38.909> know

00:00:39.169 --> 00:00:39.179 
obviously up to 200 points so you know

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:41.360 
obviously up to 200 points so you know
it's<00:00:39.390> nearly<00:00:39.629> half<00:00:40.199> of<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.409> game<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.920> can<00:00:41.129> say

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
it's nearly half of the game you can say

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.340 
it's nearly half of the game you can say
and<00:00:42.769> pretty<00:00:43.769> close<00:00:44.010> game<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.489> see<00:00:44.729> it's<00:00:44.909> like<00:00:45.059> 80
