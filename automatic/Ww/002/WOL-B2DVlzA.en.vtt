 You can download the original image. 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:50.030
 of course you ask, but why 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.360
 I do not have the original assembly that is 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.950
 me here now i will tell you what 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.410
 property 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:01.370
 This is my chip chip windows build 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:05.210
 my non-chip windows i.e. best best 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.009
 windows yes but good build too 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.560
 probably i will replace it with the original one 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:11.450
 assembly so where do we download 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.869
 we have an original image 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.990
 original windows xp image 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:19.549
 also i link to us here you download 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.319
 so this is the original image that is without 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.729
 updates without updating updates 

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:25.939
 Be yourself become and of course 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:29.240

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:32.829

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:56.659
 original images from yu won't 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:59.719

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.729
 beginning from 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:11.290
 Originally in my opinion, here is windows 7 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:13.670

 let's do the following 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:42.380
 the following so windows seven is with us 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:46.970

 there is already treatment there activator 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.269

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:57.510
