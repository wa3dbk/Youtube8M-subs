00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.930
 let's come back from chihuaha welcome a 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.630
 in addition to a banfield 4 video today as 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.250
 can see I have this look this look 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.410
 not because I need the bitch look 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.830
 but because I was playing the role and the 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:27.169
 opposing team go all with grenade 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.899
 of smoke trying to enter at least 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:32.540
 there is a tactical element in assault that 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:33.860
 I accept that it really works when 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.750
 you have the smoke grenade to enter 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.370
 but they are not doing it for bowels 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.750
 they are doing to be able to shoot from 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.760
 long and I shit and in fact we lost the 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.020
 last game and we're going pretty good and 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.800
 we lost and that bothered me 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.800
 one 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:06.680

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.680

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:22.210

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.920
 is starting to like 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:57.230
 if they stay there in this border of 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.230
 fight from afar they will never achieve 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.550
 if these guys are still there this 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.270
 very bad we are not going down the stairs 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.450

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.290

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.959
