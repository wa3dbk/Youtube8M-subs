00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.720
 activate windows 7 in all its versions 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:21.210
 for 32 and 64 bits in an easy and 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.090
 quick good friends to be able to activate 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.130
 windows 7 we will be using a 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.619
 program that will be in the description 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.019
 of the video is a portable program that 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.570
 you will have to download and 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:38.149
 extract it on the desktop but before you 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.149
 I will show that I do not have windows 7 enabled 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.210
 as seen, I still have not activated 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.390
 windows 7 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.760
 good let's continue with the video and once 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.730
 have downloaded and extracted we are going to 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.280
 proceed to activate windows 7 but before 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.230
 we will verify that we have no 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.969
 installed update in our 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.159
 computer since if we have it 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.020
 completely block the activator 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.750
 that we are going to use to activate 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.630
 windows 7 good to see if we have 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.800
 said update we will do the following 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.800
 open start menu 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.270
 then we write windows his part and what 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.810
 we open 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.399
 already open we go to where it says 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.159
 installed updates and there 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:34.829
 we will look for the update called cabe 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:38.100
 97 10 33 and the uninstall we have for 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:43.289
 we selected the update fits 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:45.450
 97 10 33 then we right click and 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:48.000
 uninstall and ready we would have 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.240
 uninstalled the update now 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.200
 let's hide it for it we go back to 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.920
 windows update and we go where it says 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.920
 important updates 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:08.840
 and we look for the update fit 97 10 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.840
 33 and we hide it 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.080
 well once we did all that already 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.230
 we could start to activate windows 7 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.480
 without any problem, we're going to the 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.760
 part that interests us to activate 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.550
 windows 7 we are going to download the activator 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.500
 which is in the description of the video 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.170
 once downloaded we extract it and 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:42.900
 we will enter the folder extracted in it 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.900
 we will open the windows loader application 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.260
 once open we go to where it says 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.260
 profile 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.210
 in all the boxes we will look for the 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.580
 model of our pc in my case hb in 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:10.340
 certain circumstance is not your 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.340
 PC model leave it as it was 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:27.520
 good once select the model of 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.470
 our pc we are not going to where it says 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:33.040
 installation 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.830
 and we click on install and it will start 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.860
 activate windows 7 we just have to 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.860
 wait 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:58.580
 once the process is finished he will ask us 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.580
 that we restart the computer 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:06.450
 once the computer restarted we can 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.450
 see that windows has been activated 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.220
 as you saw it is already activated now we go 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.890
 to do an important step to do what 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.760
 I show you then we 're going to 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.760
 windows update 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.210
 and we go where it says change 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:40.210
 configuration 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:48.120
 and where it says install updates 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.180
 important we do not install 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.310
 updates and we save because 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.800
 we do this that we do for the 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.480
 simple fact that it will not download 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.270
 an update that blocks the 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.310
 good activator that has been everything I hope 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.560
 that they liked and above all that 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.340
 it worked for them see you in a 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.340
 next video
