the material is balsa wood which is soft

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.170 
the material is balsa wood which is soft
enough<00:00:18.529> like<00:00:18.830> foam<00:00:19.160> meaning<00:00:19.670> doesn't<00:00:19.880> need

straight<00:00:23.029> edges<00:00:23.509> so<00:00:23.779> that<00:00:23.810> instead<00:00:24.199> of<00:00:24.259> using

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
straight edges so that instead of using

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.479 
straight edges so that instead of using
scissors<00:00:24.980> I<00:00:25.220> used<00:00:25.550> a<00:00:25.789> paper<00:00:26.240> knife<00:00:26.509> like<00:00:26.749> that

00:00:27.479 --> 00:00:27.489 
scissors I used a paper knife like that

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:30.279

the<00:00:28.489> balsa<00:00:28.849> wood<00:00:28.970> is<00:00:29.150> already<00:00:29.329> three<00:00:29.900> inches

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
the balsa wood is already three inches

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:32.200 
the balsa wood is already three inches
wide<00:00:30.349> and<00:00:30.890> for<00:00:31.279> the<00:00:31.339> length<00:00:31.550> I'm<00:00:31.759> also<00:00:31.939> making

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
wide and for the length I'm also making

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.870 
wide and for the length I'm also making
three<00:00:32.689> inches<00:00:33.170> marking<00:00:34.010> on<00:00:34.190> both<00:00:34.430> sides

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:34.880 
three inches marking on both sides

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.639 
three inches marking on both sides
afterwards<00:00:35.600> I<00:00:35.750> really<00:00:35.960> connect<00:00:36.350> it<00:00:36.500> with<00:00:36.530> a

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
afterwards I really connect it with a

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.280 
afterwards I really connect it with a
straight<00:00:37.010> line<00:00:37.250> so<00:00:37.580> that<00:00:38.480> I<00:00:38.510> know<00:00:38.660> that<00:00:39.170> the

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
straight line so that I know that the

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.250 
straight line so that I know that the
edges<00:00:39.680> won't<00:00:39.800> be<00:00:40.010> crooked<00:00:40.690> as<00:00:41.690> you<00:00:41.870> see<00:00:42.050> after

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
edges won't be crooked as you see after

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.350 
edges won't be crooked as you see after
I'm<00:00:42.560> done<00:00:42.710> with<00:00:42.860> that<00:00:43.040> it's<00:00:43.790> a<00:00:43.940> three<00:00:44.180> by<00:00:44.330> three

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
I'm done with that it's a three by three

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.260 
I'm done with that it's a three by three
perfect<00:00:45.050> square<00:00:45.520> adding<00:00:46.520> on<00:00:46.610> to<00:00:46.730> it<00:00:46.850> I'm<00:00:47.030> gonna

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
perfect square adding on to it I'm gonna

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.900 
perfect square adding on to it I'm gonna
mark<00:00:48.020> six<00:00:48.530> inches<00:00:48.950> which<00:00:49.190> makes<00:00:49.490> the<00:00:49.700> total

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
mark six inches which makes the total

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.290 
mark six inches which makes the total
rectangle<00:00:50.720> and<00:00:50.960> nine<00:00:51.230> inches<00:00:52.030> when<00:00:53.030> I'm<00:00:53.150> done

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
rectangle and nine inches when I'm done

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.120 
rectangle and nine inches when I'm done
with<00:00:53.420> that<00:00:53.480> I'm<00:00:53.720> taking<00:00:54.110> my<00:00:54.200> paper<00:00:54.470> knife<00:00:54.800> and

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.130 
with that I'm taking my paper knife and

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.690 
with that I'm taking my paper knife and
just<00:00:55.580> cutting<00:00:55.820> it<00:00:56.030> down<00:00:56.300> the<00:00:56.570> lines<00:00:56.840> I<00:00:57.080> made<00:00:57.380> I

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.700 
just cutting it down the lines I made I

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.590 
just cutting it down the lines I made I
suggest<00:00:58.700> essentially<00:00:59.030> drag<00:00:59.360> it<00:00:59.510> across

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
suggest essentially drag it across

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.620 
suggest essentially drag it across
because<00:01:00.140> actually<00:01:00.590> chips<00:01:01.340> the<00:01:01.670> wood<00:01:01.880> itself<00:01:02.270> I

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:02.630 
because actually chips the wood itself I

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.770 
because actually chips the wood itself I
just<00:01:03.290> stab<00:01:03.590> it<00:01:03.800> into<00:01:03.920> it<00:01:04.280> and<00:01:04.519> I<00:01:05.059> also<00:01:05.239> suggest

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
just stab it into it and I also suggest

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.170 
just stab it into it and I also suggest
measuring<00:01:06.320> it<00:01:06.439> on<00:01:06.560> both<00:01:06.799> sides<00:01:07.250> so<00:01:07.549> it<00:01:07.579> can<00:01:07.880> cut

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
measuring it on both sides so it can cut

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.170 
measuring it on both sides so it can cut
from<00:01:08.720> either<00:01:09.050> end<00:01:09.790> afterwards<00:01:10.790> there's<00:01:11.030> gonna

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
from either end afterwards there's gonna

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.780 
from either end afterwards there's gonna
be<00:01:11.420> some<00:01:11.690> rough<00:01:11.900> spots<00:01:12.050> but<00:01:12.590> I<00:01:12.710> just<00:01:13.040> use<00:01:13.610> my

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
be some rough spots but I just use my

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.780 
be some rough spots but I just use my
fingers<00:01:14.180> and<00:01:14.390> pick<00:01:14.510> it<00:01:14.540> off<00:01:14.780> I<00:01:15.610> just<00:01:16.610> lightly

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
fingers and pick it off I just lightly

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.850 
fingers and pick it off I just lightly
scrape<00:01:17.330> the<00:01:17.570> top<00:01:17.780> and<00:01:18.050> then<00:01:18.200> stab<00:01:18.560> off<00:01:18.710> the

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
scrape the top and then stab off the

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.040 
scrape the top and then stab off the
bottom<00:01:19.250> and<00:01:19.490> I<00:01:19.760> also<00:01:19.909> use<00:01:20.240> my<00:01:20.420> knife<00:01:20.600> to<00:01:20.630> take

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
bottom and I also use my knife to take

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.090 
bottom and I also use my knife to take
away<00:01:21.350> the<00:01:22.010> leftover<00:01:22.729> rescue<00:01:23.890> see<00:01:24.890> now<00:01:25.040> you

one and a half inches on all four sides
of<00:01:45.470> the<00:01:45.560> square<00:01:45.619> and<00:01:46.400> when<00:01:46.970> you're<00:01:47.090> done

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
of the square and when you're done

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.880 
of the square and when you're done
you're<00:01:47.479> going<00:01:47.600> to<00:01:47.690> connect<00:01:48.140> the<00:01:48.320> lines<00:01:48.590> as

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
you're going to connect the lines as

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:56.860 
you're going to connect the lines as
usual

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:56.870 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.110 

but<00:01:57.870> this<00:01:58.050> time<00:01:58.350> after<00:01:59.280> we've<00:01:59.520> made<00:01:59.730> a<00:01:59.790> grid

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.120 
but this time after we've made a grid

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.930 
but this time after we've made a grid
we're<00:02:00.390> only<00:02:00.690> cutting<00:02:00.990> off<00:02:01.290> one<00:02:02.070> square<00:02:02.760> in

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
we're only cutting off one square in

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:18.500 
we're only cutting off one square in
total<00:02:16.250> you<00:02:17.250> want<00:02:17.460> to<00:02:17.550> save<00:02:17.790> little<00:02:18.030> squares

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
total you want to save little squares

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.210 
total you want to save little squares
because<00:02:18.780> they<00:02:19.230> do<00:02:19.290> have<00:02:19.500> some<00:02:19.680> use<00:02:19.890> for<00:02:19.920> later

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
because they do have some use for later

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.210 
because they do have some use for later
now<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:21.180> have<00:02:21.450> some<00:02:21.720> sort<00:02:22.020> of<00:02:22.140> l-shaped<00:02:22.830> figure

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
now I have some sort of l-shaped figure

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.520 
now I have some sort of l-shaped figure

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
now piecing together side of the shelf

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.800 
now piecing together side of the shelf
this<00:04:15.580> is<00:04:15.700> where<00:04:15.880> it<00:04:16.000> adds<00:04:16.150> two<00:04:16.450> extra

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
this is where it adds two extra

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.020 
this is where it adds two extra
half-inch<00:04:17.290> because<00:04:18.280> you're<00:04:18.459> actually<00:04:18.580> gluing

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
half-inch because you're actually gluing

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.470 
half-inch because you're actually gluing
on<00:04:19.150> the<00:04:19.269> sides<00:04:19.540> of<00:04:19.870> the<00:04:19.989> base<00:04:20.170> and<00:04:20.470> not<00:04:20.620> the<00:04:20.769> top

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
on the sides of the base and not the top

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.270 
on the sides of the base and not the top
now<00:04:22.480> I'm<00:04:22.660> adding<00:04:22.900> on<00:04:23.170> the<00:04:23.410> back<00:04:23.650> of<00:04:23.890> the<00:04:23.980> shelf

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
now I'm adding on the back of the shelf

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.820 
now I'm adding on the back of the shelf
I'm<00:04:24.610> lonely<00:04:25.330> putting<00:04:25.630> glue<00:04:25.900> on<00:04:25.930> the<00:04:26.230> bottom

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
I'm lonely putting glue on the bottom

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.490 
I'm lonely putting glue on the bottom
because<00:04:27.400> if<00:04:28.060> you<00:04:28.390> put<00:04:28.660> on<00:04:28.840> all<00:04:29.080> three<00:04:29.350> who

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
because if you put on all three who

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.980 
because if you put on all three who
easily<00:04:29.860> mess<00:04:30.190> up<00:04:30.490> or<00:04:31.090> it<00:04:31.390> could<00:04:31.540> just<00:04:31.570> dry

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
easily mess up or it could just dry

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.110 
easily mess up or it could just dry
before<00:04:32.320> you<00:04:32.440> even<00:04:32.560> get<00:04:32.740> it<00:04:32.830> on<00:04:32.860> but<00:04:33.820> instead

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
before you even get it on but instead

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.330 
before you even get it on but instead
after<00:04:34.480> it's<00:04:34.870> on<00:04:35.080> I<00:04:35.380> sealed<00:04:35.710> off<00:04:35.890> the<00:04:36.040> sides

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
after it's on I sealed off the sides

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.430 
after it's on I sealed off the sides
either<00:04:36.730> on<00:04:37.120> the<00:04:37.300> second<00:04:37.720> piece<00:04:37.960> doing<00:04:38.350> the

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
either on the second piece doing the

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.240 
either on the second piece doing the
same<00:04:38.680> thing

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
same thing

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.520 
same thing
after<00:04:39.820> I'm<00:04:39.910> done<00:04:39.940> to<00:04:40.240> sealed<00:04:40.600> it<00:04:40.870> running<00:04:41.410> it

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
after I'm done to sealed it running it

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.770 
after I'm done to sealed it running it
over<00:04:41.830> with<00:04:42.010> hot<00:04:42.220> glue<00:04:42.370> now<00:04:43.180> applying<00:04:43.630> the

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
over with hot glue now applying the

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.960 
over with hot glue now applying the
shelf<00:04:44.050> as<00:04:44.290> I<00:04:44.410> mentioned<00:04:44.830> earlier<00:04:45.280> I<00:04:45.520> didn't

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
shelf as I mentioned earlier I didn't

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.120 
shelf as I mentioned earlier I didn't
add<00:04:46.090> the<00:04:46.150> half<00:04:46.750> an<00:04:46.990> inch<00:04:47.140> on<00:04:47.440> to<00:04:47.680> the<00:04:47.800> length<00:04:47.980> of

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
add the half an inch on to the length of

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.690 
add the half an inch on to the length of
my<00:04:48.220> shelves

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
my shelves

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.330 
my shelves
so<00:04:48.940> there<00:04:49.240> are<00:04:49.270> a<00:04:49.360> bit<00:04:49.690> short<00:04:50.080> so<00:04:50.710> using<00:04:51.160> these

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
so there are a bit short so using these

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.610 
so there are a bit short so using these
little<00:04:51.580> squares<00:04:52.270> I<00:04:52.450> had<00:04:52.660> extra<00:04:53.020> support<00:04:53.470> I<00:04:53.560> do

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
little squares I had extra support I do

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.230 
little squares I had extra support I do
recommend<00:04:54.010> doing<00:04:54.370> this<00:04:54.490> even<00:04:54.730> though<00:04:54.970> your

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
recommend doing this even though your

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.690 
recommend doing this even though your
shelf<00:04:55.510> is<00:04:55.750> long<00:04:55.960> enough<00:04:56.230> because<00:04:57.070> it<00:04:57.220> does<00:04:57.400> add

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
shelf is long enough because it does add

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.480 
shelf is long enough because it does add
support<00:04:58.300> and<00:04:58.540> some<00:04:58.990> width<00:04:59.410> to<00:04:59.740> the<00:04:59.860> side<00:05:00.100> and

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
support and some width to the side and

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.790 
support and some width to the side and
now<00:05:00.700> my<00:05:01.000> two<00:05:01.060> short<00:05:01.540> piece<00:05:01.720> of<00:05:01.840> board<00:05:02.080> won't

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
now my two short piece of board won't

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.390 
now my two short piece of board won't
fall<00:05:03.220> off<00:05:03.960> you<00:05:04.960> don't<00:05:05.170> actually<00:05:05.410> have<00:05:05.620> to<00:05:06.190> make

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
fall off you don't actually have to make

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.450 
fall off you don't actually have to make
the<00:05:06.670> supporting<00:05:07.270> sides<00:05:07.600> a<00:05:08.020> perfect<00:05:08.800> square<00:05:09.070> as

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
the supporting sides a perfect square as

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.680 
the supporting sides a perfect square as
long<00:05:09.730> as<00:05:10.000> it<00:05:10.360> stick<00:05:10.600> to<00:05:10.750> the<00:05:10.870> sides<00:05:11.110> and<00:05:11.530> adds

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
long as it stick to the sides and adds

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.860 
long as it stick to the sides and adds
width<00:05:14.100> now<00:05:15.100> adding<00:05:16.000> on<00:05:16.180> the<00:05:16.390> sides<00:05:16.630> of<00:05:16.750> the

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
width now adding on the sides of the

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.740 
width now adding on the sides of the
shelf<00:05:17.200> just<00:05:17.560> gluing<00:05:18.550> only<00:05:18.970> on<00:05:19.060> the<00:05:19.150> sides<00:05:19.390> make

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
shelf just gluing only on the sides make

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.810 
shelf just gluing only on the sides make
sure<00:05:19.780> that<00:05:20.169> the<00:05:20.350> clean<00:05:20.710> and<00:05:20.919> tidy<00:05:21.100> edge<00:05:21.400> is

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
sure that the clean and tidy edge is

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.090 
sure that the clean and tidy edge is
faced<00:05:22.390> outward<00:05:23.050> so<00:05:23.410> it<00:05:23.500> doesn't<00:05:23.740> look<00:05:23.890> so

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
faced outward so it doesn't look so

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.810 
faced outward so it doesn't look so
rugged<00:05:24.520> and<00:05:24.610> messy<00:05:26.220> now<00:05:27.220> after<00:05:27.580> you<00:05:27.669> got

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
rugged and messy now after you got

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.960 
rugged and messy now after you got
everything<00:05:28.150> done<00:05:28.630> here<00:05:29.490> to<00:05:30.490> seal<00:05:30.760> off

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
everything done here to seal off

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:32.730 
everything done here to seal off
everything<00:05:31.330> again<00:05:31.690> if<00:05:31.840> you<00:05:31.990> really<00:05:32.169> want<00:05:32.530> to

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
everything again if you really want to

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.590 
everything again if you really want to
you<00:05:32.919> could<00:05:33.040> paint<00:05:33.310> over<00:05:33.730> again<00:05:34.000> to<00:05:34.210> make<00:05:34.390> it

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600 
you could paint over again to make it

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.920 
you could paint over again to make it
look<00:05:35.169> less<00:05:35.440> homemade<00:05:36.010> and<00:05:36.390> if<00:05:37.390> you're<00:05:37.570> someone

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
look less homemade and if you're someone

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.810 
look less homemade and if you're someone
who<00:05:38.080> made<00:05:38.320> eight<00:05:38.620> pieces<00:05:38.890> this<00:05:39.340> is<00:05:39.550> how<00:05:39.760> the

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
who made eight pieces this is how the

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.270 
who made eight pieces this is how the
latter<00:05:40.240> effect<00:05:40.419> will<00:05:40.810> look<00:05:41.050> but<00:05:41.770> I<00:05:41.800> feel<00:05:42.130> like

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
latter effect will look but I feel like

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.460 
latter effect will look but I feel like
that<00:05:42.750> the<00:05:44.310> open<00:05:45.310> space<00:05:45.820> makes<00:05:46.330> it<00:05:46.540> look<00:05:46.780> a<00:05:47.080> lot

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.470 
that the open space makes it look a lot

00:05:47.470 --> 00:06:14.839 
that the open space makes it look a lot
cuter<00:05:47.800> and<00:05:48.130> homemade<00:05:48.669> so<00:05:49.450> here<00:05:50.110> it<00:05:50.200> is

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:14.849 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:16.909
