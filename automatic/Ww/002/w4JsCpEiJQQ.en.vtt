right<00:00:03.360> now<00:00:03.510> we<00:00:03.570> are<00:00:03.780> cutting<00:00:04.130> recesses<00:00:05.130> or<00:00:05.940> the

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
right now we are cutting recesses or the

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.120 
right now we are cutting recesses or the
craters<00:00:06.540> you<00:00:07.440> don't<00:00:07.589> want<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:07.799> creators

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
craters you don't want the creators

craters you don't want the creators
sitting<00:00:09.120> on<00:00:09.210> top<00:00:09.480> of<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:10.110> board<00:00:10.349> you<00:00:10.740> know<00:00:10.920> if

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
sitting on top of the board you know if

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.080 
sitting on top of the board you know if
something<00:00:11.219> he<00:00:11.309> actually<00:00:11.519> hit<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.759> ground<00:00:11.969> and

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
something he actually hit the ground and

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.129 
something he actually hit the ground and
they've<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.269> big<00:00:12.450> hole<00:00:12.660> in<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.809> ground<00:00:12.990> right

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
they've a big hole in the ground right

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.990 
they've a big hole in the ground right
if<00:00:13.440> this<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:13.620> sits<00:00:14.009> on<00:00:14.160> top<00:00:14.340> of<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.549> board<00:00:14.790> the

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
if this is sits on top of the board the

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.700 
if this is sits on top of the board the
holes<00:00:15.210> not<00:00:15.450> in<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.900> ground<00:00:16.049> so<00:00:16.440> we're<00:00:16.590> gonna

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
holes not in the ground so we're gonna

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.830 
holes not in the ground so we're gonna
cut<00:00:17.039> out<00:00:17.160> shapes<00:00:17.699> which<00:00:18.119> what<00:00:18.330> I<00:00:18.359> did<00:00:18.660> and

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
cut out shapes which what I did and

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.050 
cut out shapes which what I did and
these<00:00:19.470> will<00:00:19.680> sit<00:00:20.010> like<00:00:20.369> this<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.699> back<00:00:20.880> of

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
these will sit like this is the back of

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.730 
these will sit like this is the back of
the<00:00:21.119> board<00:00:21.300> either<00:00:21.689> side<00:00:22.050> so<00:00:22.260> we<00:00:22.439> cut<00:00:22.650> out

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
the board either side so we cut out

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.310 
the board either side so we cut out
shapes<00:00:22.980> of<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.730> craters<00:00:24.119> for<00:00:24.810> reinforcing

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
shapes of the craters for reinforcing

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.230 
shapes of the craters for reinforcing
the<00:00:25.529> bottoms<00:00:25.859> noreply<00:00:26.340> way<00:00:26.519> that<00:00:26.640> we<00:00:26.699> have<00:00:26.910> and

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
the bottoms noreply way that we have and

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.960 
the bottoms noreply way that we have and
watch<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:27.930> sit<00:00:28.260> right<00:00:28.470> into<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.220> board<00:00:29.429> so<00:00:29.730> it

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
watch you sit right into the board so it

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:47.299 
watch you sit right into the board so it
actually<00:00:30.090> look<00:00:30.390> like<00:00:30.619> chillier<00:00:45.980> 3/8<00:00:46.980> inch

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
actually look like chillier 3/8 inch

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.130 
actually look like chillier 3/8 inch
plywood<00:00:47.670> it's<00:00:48.090> cheaper<00:00:48.420> than<00:00:48.450> 1/2<00:00:48.719> inch<00:00:48.960> it's

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.830 
plywood it's cheaper than 1/2 inch it's
lighter<00:00:49.379> it's<00:00:49.980> just<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.219> strong<00:00:50.520> we<00:00:50.910> used<00:00:51.180> one

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
lighter it's just a strong we used one

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
bite three pint for all of our framing

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.540 
bite three pint for all of our framing

and cross braces the cross brace is a
little<00:00:56.820> bit<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.149> cheaper<00:00:57.510> stuff<00:00:57.570> but<00:00:58.199> we<00:00:58.500> use

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
little bit the cheaper stuff but we use

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.790 
little bit the cheaper stuff but we use
pretty<00:00:58.980> like<00:00:59.309> nice<00:00:59.520> wood<00:01:00.180> exterior<00:01:01.050> each

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
pretty like nice wood exterior each

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.189 
pretty like nice wood exterior each
board<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.340> 4<00:01:02.670> feet<00:01:02.879> by<00:01:02.940> 6<00:01:03.510> foot<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:04.140> I'm

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
board is 4 feet by 6 foot so I'm

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.230 
board is 4 feet by 6 foot so I'm
starting<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.559> get<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.860> idea<00:01:05.220> this<00:01:05.400> how<00:01:05.610> big<00:01:05.880> it

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
starting to get the idea this how big it

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.649 
starting to get the idea this how big it
is<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.960> was<00:01:07.830> using<00:01:08.100> carpenters<00:01:08.729> glue<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:09.180> ran<00:01:09.510> out

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
is I was using carpenters glue I ran out

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.420 
is I was using carpenters glue I ran out
of<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.140> it's<00:01:10.290> come<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.590> mix<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:11.070> white<00:01:11.250> glue

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
of it so it's come a mix of white glue

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.399 
of it so it's come a mix of white glue
and<00:01:11.580> car<00:01:11.760> burglary<00:01:12.330> now<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.780> Carpenters<00:01:13.200> lose

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
and car burglary now the Carpenters lose

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.170 
and car burglary now the Carpenters lose
really<00:01:13.680> what<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.920> can<00:01:14.070> use<00:01:14.250> bonds<00:01:15.000> much

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
really what you can use bonds much

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.359 
really what you can use bonds much
better<00:01:15.450> than<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.840> regular<00:01:15.990> PVA<00:01:16.500> glue<00:01:16.560> 5/8

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
better than the regular PVA glue 5/8

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.390 
better than the regular PVA glue 5/8
this<00:01:17.880> 3/8<00:01:18.509> plus<00:01:18.750> 3/8<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.439> what<00:01:19.680> 12<00:01:20.159> eights

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
this 3/8 plus 3/8 is what 12 eights

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.240 
this 3/8 plus 3/8 is what 12 eights
which<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:20.939> what<00:01:21.150> 3/4<00:01:21.780> inch<00:01:21.900> so<00:01:22.710> this<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.100> just

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
which is what 3/4 inch so this is just

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.630 
which is what 3/4 inch so this is just
shy<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.689> 3/4<00:01:24.689> inch<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.170> can<00:01:25.409> actually<00:01:25.640> put

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
shy of 3/4 inch so you can actually put

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.609 
shy of 3/4 inch so you can actually put
a<00:01:26.670> screw<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.000> through<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.630> into<00:01:28.110> two<00:01:28.290> sheets<00:01:28.530> of

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
a screw in through it into two sheets of

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.690 
a screw in through it into two sheets of
plywood<00:01:29.240> and<00:01:30.470> it<00:01:31.470> won't<00:01:31.680> pop<00:01:32.400> through<00:01:32.610> the

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
plywood and it won't pop through the

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.330 
plywood and it won't pop through the
other<00:01:32.820> side<00:01:33.079> see<00:01:34.079> any<00:01:34.680> bigger<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.130> B<00:01:35.220> coming

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
other side see any bigger and B coming

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.429 
other side see any bigger and B coming
out<00:01:35.549> like<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.759> into<00:01:36.479> our<00:01:36.509> fingers<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:37.110> we

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
out like that into our fingers so we

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.960 
out like that into our fingers so we
don't<00:01:37.650> want<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.950> show<00:01:38.130> it's<00:01:38.549> all<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.820> math

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
don't want it to show it's all the math

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.000 
don't want it to show it's all the math
kids<00:01:39.299> it's<00:01:39.509> all<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.810> math

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
kids it's all the math

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.770 
kids it's all the math
Duke<00:01:42.010> saw<00:01:42.220> the<00:01:42.280> kind<00:01:42.610> of<00:01:42.700> shapes<00:01:43.600> that<00:01:43.720> I

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
Duke saw the kind of shapes that I

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.760 
Duke saw the kind of shapes that I
needed<00:01:43.990> to<00:01:44.170> reinforce<00:01:44.590> them<00:01:46.050> I'm<00:01:47.050> telling<00:01:47.620> too

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
needed to reinforce them I'm telling too

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.350 
needed to reinforce them I'm telling too
much<00:01:47.950> about<00:01:48.160> it<00:01:48.370> the<00:01:48.580> cool<00:01:48.790> thing<00:01:48.970> about<00:01:49.000> this

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
much about it the cool thing about this

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.330 
much about it the cool thing about this
board<00:01:49.590> policy<00:01:50.590> it's<00:01:50.710> working<00:01:51.040> work

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340

everything<00:01:52.000> is<00:01:52.270> going<00:01:52.420> to<00:01:52.479> be<00:01:52.540> able<00:01:52.690> to

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:52.870 
everything is going to be able to
