00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.949
 listening to music 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.600
 by the way song music time to answer 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.580
 questions that many of you ask me 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.890
 I start to answer them or I'm going to stay 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.590
 on the road first of all you have a 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.530
 very cool list resolana of these that 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.530
 motivate that thing 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:32.540
 that is called running sanjuanero the 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.430
 you will find in spotify running 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.440
 sanjuanero but here below in the 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.300
 description I leave the link to the list 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.000
 as there 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.460
 path of 200 songs over 8 hours 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.800
 of music that are what I use to 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.750
 mount videos to go running for 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.079
 train me in definite those that 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.079
 we listen and we keep running here 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.000
 for the sand today it's time to do a little 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:59.870
 force work and when you run for the 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.870
 sand 4 you get 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.519
 I'm going to tell you one thing that you have 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.670
 asked many times the first 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.680
 when you run you record videos and take the 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.310
 headphones on now I'm going to stop 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.800
 one moment you're listening to music not 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.100
 because it's doing two things at once but 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.619
 three would not run it's hard to record it at 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.009
 same time also if you also already talk 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.560
 It's screwed but if I put music here 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.149
 fucked with which 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.030
 I do not take off my helmets because then 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:34.070
 I would not know where to put them because before 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.200
 record I'm training and after 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.579
 record I also keep training less 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.050
 I leave but the volume of the 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:41.790
 song and the theme 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:46.050
 the subject that burns as the child says of 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.850
 the mortgage turns out that you have 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.590
 asked many times what is the 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.530
 song that you have most often heard 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.860
 I'm going to tell you a secret many 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.540
 days when I have a long training or 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.740
 when I have to make a career and 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.930
 I did this for the first time in 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.140
 barcelona apparatus from a year ago and 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.480
 peak then when I have a long career 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.800
 I choose a song and when I have this 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.050
 song attention that this can be a 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.190
 obsessive and it is true it is but this 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.080
 It is also when he tells us a little 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.150
 how is the character 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.370
 the son of that song I put it on 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.830
 repeat and I'm able to hear it gives me 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.520
 ten minutes fifteen minutes half an hour 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.720
 one hour and up to four hours or more and 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.790
 now I will tell you a few secrets 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.560
 related to this for example for 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.480
 all of Barcelona that does that a year and 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.000
 peak at that time there was a song 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.850
 that I liked a lot that was citizens 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.730
 from a place of beloved world 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.530
 of faith and host I liked a lot 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.720
 I was talking about Barcelona talking about the 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.850
 connectivity talked about creation had 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.770
 a rhythm and a good roll very handsome 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.790
 I spent all the marathon in Barcelona 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:52.550
 I've heard that song listening 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.280
 place of beloved world then come there is a 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.740
 little while 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.990
 when I went back to doing that the next 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.150
 long race that I did was the marathon 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.370
 of the desert the isostar desert marathon 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.650
 that the most fucking whores phases because 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.780
 they were 47 kilometers through the desert of 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.280
 Monegros instead of July at 12 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.890
 noon and I was not trained to 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.630
 do that, I do not think I was 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.230
 like five hours or so he did not remember very 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.630
 ok but the song that I heard there - in 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.830
 repetitive was an acoustic version of 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.800
 a song that I really like about 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.930
 vetusta morla called mouth in 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.819
 land 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.379
 since then if all the time there with the 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.700
 guitar 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.620
 not me with the guitar but listening 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.209
 like scratch he beat the guitar and like 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.189
 I sang the version that I also believe 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.319
 that should be even a model 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:41.640
 because it is what is in spotify in that 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:44.180
 version when I went back to doing this 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.180
 and 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.130
 Christian I remember very well but I know 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.350
 that for example even though I could not 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.060
 listen to music in the part of the 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.430
 marathon of the ironman of lanzarote 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.620
 the song that he had in his head and 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.000
 I was practically singing it 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.640
 then I used in the assembly of the video 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.300
 from the ironman of lanzarote and the song 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:09.060
 It was the ugly one again 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:12.120
 I will never stop pushing and then in 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.120
 the far right I used a very thing 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:18.450
 similar with a libyan run by julian 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.030
 plenti good which is the time more beast 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.890
 rough that I'm going to change hands that I 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.490
 I'm leaving the arm which is the time 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:30.870
 more beast than I have done this because host 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:32.310
 in the ultraman double marathon there I took 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.170
 a song that was days I 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.400
 was around the head and look no 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.610
 it had never been a song that 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.700
 I would like it very much but I do not know how it came to me 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:44.160
 to my iphone and I put it there in the list of 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:48.289
 spotify playback and the song was 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:50.560
 the empire state of mind 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:54.520
 6 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:57.010
 temazo theme that is not terrific because I 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.740
 I passed the 84 kilometers that at the end 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:02.139
 they went out 86 listening to that song in 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.400
 repeat is true there was cheating because 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:05.530
 with mauro who is the uncle with whom 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.450
 we ran the first 55 kilometers 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.990
 together there were moments that we talked 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:12.280
 then there the volume went down and let's say 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.660
 that at that time did not count but there 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.120
 I kept listening to the song 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.130
 What good is this good for me first? 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.440
 I am an obsessive uncle I remember that 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.720
 when I was little or smaller and 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.820
 I had homework and I was on the bus 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.770
 Cole and how much noise there was 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.570
 a song and I put it in repeat and 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.550
 then as it goes repeating so many 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.380
 sometimes you stop listening to it and 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.510
 then I could read or do homework 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.920
 or whatever without hearing the noise of the 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:40.040
 around 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:42.560
 how does this help me when it comes to running 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.970
 hosts are songs that have first 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.020
 they give you an energy they help you 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.570
 disconnect from what you are doing 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.670
 etcetera second if you like they give you 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:51.660
 joy and give you a strength then beautiful 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:53.960
 third 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:57.840
 they are usually songs in a certain way 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:00.060
 syncopated or rhythmic with a melody 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.710
 that can move you to a certain rhythm 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.840
 or that you end up marking it in certain 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.700
 rhythms like in spinning for thorn and 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.790
 puts you in a song and there's 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:10.620
 theme raquel because climbing you there could 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:11.910
 climb a mountain and now that the 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.860
 moment to stretch you put a song 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:17.610
 quote that is rather well upside down a 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:21.960
 song like that melodic medium type one of 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:27.120
 u2 for audio life these things take and I 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:31.170
 I think a little bit then that serves you 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:33.150
 to catch the rhythm and to go pulling and 

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:35.280
 at the end it is also true that in those 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:37.020
 moments that you no longer know how to throw that 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.940
 You have three or five hours 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.430
 running you know you have two or 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.260
 three more fuck it is important to have there 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:46.410
 a song that I can help you 

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:49.260
 little to not be to disconnect that to 

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:50.490
 sing even to make you happy like that 

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.470
 that this is my great secret with the 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:54.930
 songs of the obsessive character I am 

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:56.190
 able to train 123 or run or even 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.840
 4 hours 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:00.090
 in the race also in the case that 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.280
 allow this music theme with 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:04.790
 the same song and you know why it could 

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.790
 slow down me better 

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.889
 and that it is known that all these 

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.810
 songs are on the actual list of 

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:13.270
 spotify runner playback 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:16.949
 sanjuanero that you have down here in the 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:16.949
 description day and if you are
