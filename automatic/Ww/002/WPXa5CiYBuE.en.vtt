on a point-and-shoot but you can do this

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.640 
on a point-and-shoot but you can do this
on<00:00:39.670> here<00:00:40.210> and<00:00:40.330> when<00:00:40.750> you<00:00:40.840> open<00:00:41.110> them<00:00:41.260> when<00:00:41.530> you

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 
on here and when you open them when you

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.140 
on here and when you open them when you
say<00:00:41.800> them<00:00:41.830> in<00:00:42.130> RAW<00:00:42.310> they<00:00:42.580> look<00:00:42.760> like<00:00:42.880> these

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.150 
say them in RAW they look like these

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.680 
say them in RAW they look like these
kind<00:00:43.450> of<00:00:43.540> files<00:00:43.810> on<00:00:44.110> your<00:00:44.200> computer<00:00:45.420> so<00:00:46.420> when

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
kind of files on your computer so when

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.750 
kind of files on your computer so when
you<00:00:47.080> end<00:00:47.320> up<00:00:47.500> opening<00:00:47.920> them<00:00:48.130> on<00:00:48.400> your<00:00:48.610> computer

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
you end up opening them on your computer

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.150 
you end up opening them on your computer
it<00:00:49.450> automatically<00:00:50.200> opens<00:00:50.290> to<00:00:50.650> this<00:00:50.770> program

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
it automatically opens to this program

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.660 
it automatically opens to this program
that's<00:00:51.310> kind<00:00:51.520> of<00:00:51.580> connected<00:00:52.150> to<00:00:53.430> Photoshop<00:00:54.430> I

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
that's kind of connected to Photoshop I

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.670 
that's kind of connected to Photoshop I
guess<00:00:54.880> but<00:00:55.090> this<00:00:55.210> is<00:00:55.330> Camera<00:00:55.720> Raw<00:00:55.930> and<00:00:56.230> it'll

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
guess but this is Camera Raw and it'll

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.590 
guess but this is Camera Raw and it'll
tell<00:00:56.830> you<00:00:57.010> all<00:00:57.040> the<00:00:57.310> details<00:00:57.730> here<00:00:58.150> it'll<00:00:58.360> tell

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
tell you all the details here it'll tell

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.110 
tell you all the details here it'll tell
you<00:00:58.750> hear<00:00:59.050> what<00:00:59.230> your<00:00:59.380> photo<00:00:59.620> was<00:00:59.860> shot<00:01:00.070> in<00:01:00.310> and

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
you hear what your photo was shot in and

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.610 
you hear what your photo was shot in and
then<00:01:01.270> all<00:01:01.450> of<00:01:01.480> the<00:01:01.750> adjustments<00:01:02.320> are<00:01:02.410> right

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
then all of the adjustments are right

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.840 
then all of the adjustments are right
here<00:01:02.920> so<00:01:02.950> I'll<00:01:03.310> take<00:01:03.520> you<00:01:03.640> through<00:01:03.790> the

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
like to do every photo in situation is a

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.239 
like to do every photo in situation is a
little<00:01:08.170> bit<00:01:08.320> different<00:01:08.799> and<00:01:08.920> it's<00:01:09.039> also

00:01:09.239 --> 00:01:09.249 
little bit different and it's also

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:10.919 
little bit different and it's also
personal<00:01:09.820> preference<00:01:10.299> but<00:01:10.479> this<00:01:10.630> is<00:01:10.780> just

00:01:10.919 --> 00:01:10.929 
personal preference but this is just

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:14.609 
personal preference but this is just
what<00:01:11.079> I<00:01:11.109> like<00:01:11.350> so<00:01:11.679> I<00:01:11.890> hope<00:01:12.549> you<00:01:12.700> enjoy<00:01:13.409> first<00:01:14.409> I

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:16.550 
what I like so I hope you enjoy first I
always<00:01:14.649> like<00:01:15.009> to<00:01:15.039> mess<00:01:15.310> with<00:01:15.520> the<00:01:15.729> contrast

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
always like to mess with the contrast

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.480 
always like to mess with the contrast
contrast<00:01:17.560> is<00:01:17.710> what's<00:01:17.920> going<00:01:18.130> to<00:01:18.189> make

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
contrast is what's going to make

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.090 
contrast is what's going to make
obviously<00:01:19.420> contrast<00:01:20.140> if<00:01:20.259> you<00:01:20.289> do<00:01:20.499> less<00:01:20.770> than

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
obviously contrast if you do less than

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.039 
obviously contrast if you do less than
it's<00:01:21.249> the<00:01:21.819> image<00:01:22.090> is<00:01:22.210> more<00:01:22.359> flat<00:01:22.630> if<00:01:22.780> you<00:01:22.899> do

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
it's the image is more flat if you do

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:24.510 
it's the image is more flat if you do
more<00:01:23.289> there's<00:01:23.530> more<00:01:23.590> dimension<00:01:24.340> to<00:01:24.490> your

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
more there's more dimension to your

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.219 
more there's more dimension to your
photos<00:01:24.939> so<00:01:25.060> I<00:01:25.090> always<00:01:25.450> like<00:01:25.600> to<00:01:25.630> have<00:01:25.869> this<00:01:26.020> up

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
photos so I always like to have this up

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.800 
photos so I always like to have this up
a<00:01:26.499> bit<00:01:26.890> but<00:01:27.520> you<00:01:27.579> can<00:01:27.729> tell<00:01:27.909> that<00:01:28.030> once<00:01:28.240> I<00:01:28.420> make

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
a bit but you can tell that once I make

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.410 
a bit but you can tell that once I make
my<00:01:28.840> contrast<00:01:29.499> very<00:01:29.799> high<00:01:30.189> that<00:01:30.880> the<00:01:31.060> colors

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
my contrast very high that the colors

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.849 
my contrast very high that the colors
are<00:01:31.569> kind<00:01:31.689> of<00:01:31.810> weird<00:01:32.079> and<00:01:32.289> the<00:01:32.350> picture<00:01:32.679> gets

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:32.859 
are kind of weird and the picture gets

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:35.129 
are kind of weird and the picture gets
dark<00:01:33.159> so<00:01:33.369> I<00:01:33.789> don't<00:01:34.270> really<00:01:34.450> like<00:01:34.630> how<00:01:34.780> orange

00:01:35.129 --> 00:01:35.139 
dark so I don't really like how orange

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:37.080 
dark so I don't really like how orange

is<00:01:37.240> a<00:01:37.270> few<00:01:37.569> things<00:01:37.749> you<00:01:37.840> can<00:01:37.990> do<00:01:38.170> you<00:01:38.289> can

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:38.469 
is a few things you can do you can

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:40.410 
is a few things you can do you can
change<00:01:38.710> the<00:01:38.889> temperature<00:01:39.249> or<00:01:39.609> the<00:01:39.670> saturation

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
change the temperature or the saturation

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.749 
change the temperature or the saturation
so<00:01:40.990> to<00:01:41.049> make<00:01:41.319> it<00:01:41.469> less<00:01:41.740> color<00:01:42.100> in<00:01:42.340> the<00:01:42.490> photo

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:20.850 
can change the vibrance of your photo
can<00:03:19.510> be<00:03:19.540> very<00:03:19.900> colored<00:03:20.320> or<00:03:20.590> it<00:03:20.650> can<00:03:20.770> be

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
can be very colored or it can be

completely<00:03:21.280> be<00:03:21.490> saturated<00:03:22.180> I<00:03:22.300> want<00:03:23.230> this<00:03:23.380> just

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
completely be saturated I want this just

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.610 
completely be saturated I want this just
a<00:03:24.070> little<00:03:24.310> bit<00:03:24.580> and<00:03:25.120> then<00:03:25.810> the<00:03:25.989> clarity<00:03:26.500> this

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
a little bit and then the clarity this

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.350 
a little bit and then the clarity this
will<00:03:26.800> make<00:03:26.980> it<00:03:27.100> sharper<00:03:27.820> and<00:03:28.000> this<00:03:28.090> will<00:03:28.209> make

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
will make it sharper and this will make

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.190 
will make it sharper and this will make
it<00:03:28.480> like<00:03:29.019> looking<00:03:29.760> overly<00:03:30.760> airbrushed<00:03:31.180> so<00:03:31.870> I

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
it like looking overly airbrushed so I

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.590 
it like looking overly airbrushed so I
like<00:03:32.590> it<00:03:32.620> just<00:03:32.769> a<00:03:33.070> little<00:03:33.670> less<00:03:33.970> of<00:03:34.209> this<00:03:34.420> so

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
like it just a little less of this so

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.900 
like it just a little less of this so
it's<00:03:34.750> not<00:03:34.930> crazy<00:03:35.680> sharp<00:03:36.100> but<00:03:36.250> it's<00:03:36.370> a<00:03:36.459> litte

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
it's not crazy sharp but it's a litte

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.960 
it's not crazy sharp but it's a litte
like<00:03:37.630> a<00:03:37.660> slight<00:03:38.200> blur<00:03:38.560> without<00:03:38.980> being<00:03:39.220> overly

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
like a slight blur without being overly

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.030 
like a slight blur without being overly
blurred<00:03:40.239> so<00:03:40.870> here<00:03:41.170> you<00:03:41.320> can<00:03:41.500> kind<00:03:41.739> of<00:03:41.860> mess

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
blurred so here you can kind of mess

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.699 
blurred so here you can kind of mess
with<00:03:42.250> the<00:03:42.370> photo<00:03:42.610> again<00:03:43.090> you<00:03:44.080> can<00:03:44.230> go<00:03:44.350> back<00:03:44.530> and

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
with the photo again you can go back and

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.080 
with the photo again you can go back and
change<00:03:44.890> little<00:03:45.130> things<00:03:45.370> again<00:03:45.670> and<00:03:45.700> have<00:03:45.940> it

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
change little things again and have it

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.180 
change little things again and have it
be<00:03:46.239> exactly<00:03:46.720> how<00:03:46.900> you<00:03:46.959> want<00:03:47.260> it<00:03:47.290> to<00:03:47.350> be<00:03:47.620> but

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
be exactly how you want it to be but

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.009 
be exactly how you want it to be but
that's<00:03:48.400> pretty<00:03:48.670> much<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:48.970> process<00:03:49.150> of<00:03:49.660> how<00:03:49.959> I

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
that's pretty much the process of how I

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.250

edit<00:03:50.350> it<00:03:50.620> so<00:03:50.970> this<00:03:51.970> is<00:03:52.030> what<00:03:52.390> you<00:03:52.510> can<00:03:52.720> see<00:03:52.750> the
