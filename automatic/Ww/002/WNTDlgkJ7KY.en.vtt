00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.180 
ok but don't twist it does just like to
stay<00:02:42.110> one<00:02:42.380> big<00:02:42.650> ol<00:02:42.830> like<00:02:43.810> twisting<00:02:44.810> and<00:02:45.260> then

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
stay one big ol like twisting and then

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.030 
stay one big ol like twisting and then
wrapping<00:02:46.460> around<00:02:46.550> I<00:02:47.350> never<00:02:48.350> tried<00:02:48.590> like<00:02:48.860> that

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
wrapping around I never tried like that

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.360 
wrapping around I never tried like that
before<00:02:49.220> but<00:02:49.670> I<00:02:50.140> think<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.260> two<00:02:51.440> strand<00:02:52.010> twists

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
before but I think the two strand twists

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.240 
before but I think the two strand twists
and<00:02:52.730> then<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.150> bantu<00:02:53.480> knot<00:02:53.660> works<00:02:54.250> really

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
and then the bantu knot works really

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.180 
and then the bantu knot works really
