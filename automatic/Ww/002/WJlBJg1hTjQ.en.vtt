yeah I'll say last week basically the
point<00:00:11.010> is<00:00:11.130> that<00:00:11.250> they<00:00:11.370> didn't<00:00:11.639> answer<00:00:11.790> my

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
point is that they didn't answer my

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:12.470 
point is that they didn't answer my
question

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
question

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.749 
question
but<00:00:13.259> they<00:00:13.380> did<00:00:13.530> disregard<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.099> large<00:00:14.309> number<00:00:14.549> of

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
but they did disregard a large number of

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:23.599 
but they did disregard a large number of
questions<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.299> spoiler<00:00:15.690> territory<00:00:22.220> so<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.250> can

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
questions the spoiler territory so I can

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.340 
questions the spoiler territory so I can
only<00:00:23.789> assume<00:00:23.970> that<00:00:24.359> learning<00:00:24.689> why<00:00:24.840> torchwick

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
only assume that learning why torchwick

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.900 
only assume that learning why torchwick
didn't<00:00:25.710> get<00:00:25.890> stopped<00:00:26.189> by<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.400> Huntsman<00:00:26.849> and

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
didn't get stopped by the Huntsman and

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.700 
didn't get stopped by the Huntsman and
huntresses<00:00:27.000> would<00:00:27.630> constitute<00:00:28.260> as<00:00:28.349> revealing

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
huntresses would constitute as revealing

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.290 
huntresses would constitute as revealing
some<00:00:29.039> crucial<00:00:29.310> plot<00:00:29.609> point<00:00:29.910> now<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.210> only

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
some crucial plot point now the only

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.790 
some crucial plot point now the only

rational thing to do in this situation

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.280 
rational thing to do in this situation
is<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.700> take<00:00:32.940> this<00:00:33.149> evidence<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.690> its<00:00:33.840> logical

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
is to take this evidence to its logical

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
well maybe torchwick is aware that

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.090 
well maybe torchwick is aware that
cinder<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.240> planning<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.840> infiltrate<00:01:52.350> beacon

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
and that these kids might be students at

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.709 
and that these kids might be students at
beacon<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.549> if<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:56.909> told<00:01:57.119> them<00:01:57.329> anything

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
beacon and if you told them anything

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.630 
beacon and if you told them anything
about<00:01:58.079> what<00:01:58.290> was<00:01:58.590> going<00:01:58.799> on<00:01:59.040> they<00:01:59.430> might

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
about what was going on they might

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.030 
about what was going on they might
accidentally<00:02:00.479> say<00:02:00.719> something<00:02:01.290> in<00:02:01.500> earshot<00:02:02.009> of

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
accidentally say something in earshot of

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.179 
accidentally say something in earshot of
one<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.640> cinders<00:02:03.060> henchmen<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:04.020> then<00:02:04.680> that

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
one of cinders henchmen and then that

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.249 
one of cinders henchmen and then that
would<00:02:05.399> mean<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:05.700> torchwick<00:02:06.450> gets<00:02:06.810> greenlit

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
would mean that torchwick gets greenlit

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.229 
would mean that torchwick gets greenlit
so<00:02:07.860> with<00:02:08.069> all<00:02:08.220> this<00:02:08.429> overwhelming

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
so with all this overwhelming

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.180 
so with all this overwhelming
irrefutable<00:02:09.840> evidence<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.709> think<00:02:11.009> it's

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
irrefutable evidence I think it's

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.550 
irrefutable evidence I think it's
painfully<00:02:11.700> obvious

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
painfully obvious

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.559 
painfully obvious
the<00:02:12.770> reason<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.430> answer<00:02:13.580> to<00:02:14.030> this<00:02:14.150> simple

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
the reason the answer to this simple

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.510 
the reason the answer to this simple
question<00:02:15.020> would<00:02:15.230> be<00:02:15.260> considered<00:02:15.830> a<00:02:15.950> spoiler

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
question would be considered a spoiler

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.550 
question would be considered a spoiler
is<00:02:16.730> because<00:02:17.120> torchwick<00:02:17.600> is<00:02:17.780> not<00:02:18.110> in<00:02:18.319> fact

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
is because torchwick is not in fact

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:28.030 
is because torchwick is not in fact
stealing<00:02:19.190> dust<00:02:21.100> he's<00:02:22.100> buying<00:02:22.430> it<00:02:26.709> yeah<00:02:27.709> well
