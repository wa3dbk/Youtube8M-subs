00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.610
 the way of use 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.950
 We're going to stick to our prescription today. 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.950
 had hair if you want tea 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.200
 use the chador and risk to strengthen the 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.780
 your hair to stimulate growth 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:34.019
 this is one of the ways I use what is 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.849
 tea is one of the ways the others I go 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:39.629
 teach for you too 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:43.859
 You do not even like you do in tea is 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:46.739
 plants flowers they are not boiling tea 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:50.879
 First you get water after you. 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:53.220
 add one or two tablespoons of 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:56.250
 plant in the case will be the hibiscus in my 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.669
 if I use dry hibiscus they will launch 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:02.849
 For you, what I use is this one. 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:04.290
 These are the already accepted sheets and I know that 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.720
 A lot of people should be thinking and 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.609
 running on stage of the plant already to do 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.000
 tea but the ideal is that you 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:14.400
 use the plant that is sold in houses 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.849
 of natural products 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:22.220
 So these plants you have there 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:24.960
 she suffers time action is the humidity 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.630
 these things then still the ideal is that 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:31.560
 uses the dry leaves 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:33.150
 It's good, the price is not expensive. It varies. 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:37.500
 depending on how much you 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:41.070
 buy it ranges from 4 reais above 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:45.180
 so it's not expensive you can use hibiscus 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:48.270
 there to have those benefits and maintain 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.699
 your healthy hair that is the important and 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.830
 research and also people about the 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:54.479
 benefits of health risk then 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.610
 who likes tea 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:05:00.389
 This is one more to put on the list. 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:04.400
 and as I said respecting the limits and 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:07.310
 It's a good way to use it, so this is it 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:10.370
 people I hope you have enjoyed 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:13.759
 I've already speak for those who are 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:16.039
 Wondering where to find you can? 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:19.460
 find countless places 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:21.860
 because it has many, many bishops 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.259
 scattered here through this 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.910
 Obesity bishop is also known as 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:27.919
 grease 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.780
 I spent my childhood knowing this 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:32.479
 plant by the name of grease 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:35.180
 is more especially in 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:38.720
 natural products that herb houses that 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:41.570
 where are flowers plants sold? 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:44.320
 to make tea then 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:47.900
 those are already planted and 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:50.750
 definitely worth the use and hopefully 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:53.090
 You liked this video and it's 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:56.210
 very easy to use after you mayor 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:58.070
 tea after you've done what you 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.590
 you've done in your hair any 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:03.380
 treatment 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:06.099
 There you only play and let the hair 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.310
 smell is not bad she has a taste 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:08.870
 sweet 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:12.380
 in my opinion and has a smell 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:15.979
 super nice of all the teas I 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:17.030
 use that I like the most without shadow of 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:19.099
 doubts 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:21.409
 and another thing I forgot to tell 

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:24.889
 that it is indicated to preserve color 

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:26.750
 black hair is also bright and 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:28.849
 also included hairs then 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:31.039
 redheads can use it there at will 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:34.070
 I 'm afraid you even had 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:37.010
 risk for redheads 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:40.190
 there is even with demonstration then 

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:43.580
 wait because there are cloud surprises out there 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:45.500
 Okay, and if you liked the video click 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.389

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:50.539
 friends of your friends with your family
