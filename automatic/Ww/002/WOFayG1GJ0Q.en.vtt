and<00:02:23.380> do<00:02:23.500> very<00:02:23.740> little<00:02:23.890> chip<00:02:24.190> damage<00:02:24.370> so<00:02:25.270> just

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
and do very little chip damage so just

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.260 
and do very little chip damage so just
block<00:02:25.720> like<00:02:25.930> normal<00:02:26.320> and<00:02:26.410> you'll<00:02:26.530> be<00:02:26.680> fine
