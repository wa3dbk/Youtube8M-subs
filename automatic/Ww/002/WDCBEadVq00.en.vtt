210 and eminent speakers cut down on the
weight<00:00:46.829> we've<00:00:47.010> got<00:00:47.190> some<00:00:48.030> really<00:00:48.600> thin

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
weight we've got some really thin

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.819 
weight we've got some really thin
lightweight<00:00:49.260> plywood<00:00:49.860> very<00:00:50.399> strong<00:00:50.930> but<00:00:51.930> you

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
lightweight plywood very strong but you

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.260 
lightweight plywood very strong but you
know<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.070> cuts<00:00:53.550> down<00:00:53.670> on<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.879> footprint<00:00:54.210> a

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
know it cuts down on the footprint a

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.510 
know it cuts down on the footprint a
little<00:00:54.449> bit<00:00:54.570> on<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.750> weight<00:00:54.899> okay<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:55.890> they

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
little bit on the weight okay so they

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.979 
little bit on the weight okay so they
all<00:00:56.670> pretty<00:00:56.820> much<00:00:56.940> share<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.360> same<00:00:57.570> preamp

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
all pretty much share the same preamp

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.049 
all pretty much share the same preamp
except<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.410> 15<00:00:58.800> but<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.430> it's<00:00:59.579> very<00:00:59.730> easy<00:00:59.850> to

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
except the 15 but so it's very easy to

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.450 
except the 15 but so it's very easy to
use<00:01:00.270> XLR<00:01:00.809> output<00:01:02.510> but<00:01:04.159> the<00:01:05.159> one<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.400> I'm
