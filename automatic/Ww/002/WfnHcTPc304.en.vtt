hey<00:00:05.100> there<00:00:05.629> and<00:00:06.629> welcome<00:00:06.839> to<00:00:07.140> don't<00:00:07.379> be<00:00:07.470> dumb

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:08.150 
hey there and welcome to don't be dumb

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:14.320 
hey there and welcome to don't be dumb
i'm<00:00:09.150> josh<00:00:09.870> clark<00:00:10.670> thank<00:00:11.670> you<00:00:11.940> for<00:00:12.330> joining<00:00:12.570> me

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
i'm josh clark thank you for joining me

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.820 
i'm josh clark thank you for joining me
have<00:00:15.330> you<00:00:15.660> ever<00:00:16.020> been<00:00:16.350> in<00:00:16.710> an<00:00:17.369> airplane<00:00:17.910> and

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
have you ever been in an airplane and

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.310 
have you ever been in an airplane and
wanted<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:20.010> die<00:00:20.310> because<00:00:21.270> all<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.930> sudden

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
wanted to die because all of a sudden

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.620 
wanted to die because all of a sudden
your<00:00:22.590> ears<00:00:22.980> started<00:00:23.580> hurting<00:00:23.939> really<00:00:24.449> really

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
your ears started hurting really really

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.500 
your ears started hurting really really
bad<00:00:26.900> well<00:00:27.900> that<00:00:28.199> wasn't<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.740> demon<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:30.240> was

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
bad well that wasn't a demon that was

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.100 
bad well that wasn't a demon that was
due<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.929> air<00:00:31.140> pressure<00:00:32.600> there<00:00:33.600> probably

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
due to air pressure there probably

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.510 
due to air pressure there probably
aren't<00:00:34.440> any<00:00:34.770> demons

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.080 

see<00:00:39.560> there<00:00:40.560> is<00:00:40.680> such<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:40.980> thing<00:00:41.400> as<00:00:41.670> air

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
see there is such a thing as air

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.670 
see there is such a thing as air
pressure<00:00:43.070> which<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.610> amount<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.960> pressure

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
pressure which is the amount of pressure

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.220 
pressure which is the amount of pressure
created<00:00:47.610> by<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.940> weight<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:49.020> whole
