it<00:01:49.130> look<00:01:49.280> slimmer<00:01:49.700> so<00:01:50.390> in<00:01:50.479> my<00:01:50.659> case<00:01:50.720> I'm

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
it look slimmer so in my case I'm

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.110 
it look slimmer so in my case I'm
applying<00:01:51.590> two<00:01:51.950> lines<00:01:52.190> on<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:52.520> sides<00:01:52.790> of<00:01:52.970> my

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
applying two lines on the sides of my

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.080 
applying two lines on the sides of my
nose<00:01:53.150> with<00:01:53.659> a<00:01:53.690> dark<00:01:54.020> contour<00:01:54.500> shade<00:01:54.800> and

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
nose with a dark contour shade and

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.160 
nose with a dark contour shade and
everyone's<00:01:56.090> nose<00:01:56.330> is<00:01:56.630> different<00:01:57.050> of<00:01:57.140> course

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
everyone's nose is different of course

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.990 
everyone's nose is different of course
so<00:01:57.620> you<00:01:57.710> can<00:01:57.860> play<00:01:58.040> around<00:01:58.190> with<00:01:58.400> the<00:01:58.550> contour

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
so you can play around with the contour

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.120 
so you can play around with the contour
and<00:01:59.090> find<00:01:59.420> out<00:01:59.600> which<00:02:00.110> contour<00:02:00.620> technique<00:02:00.979> is

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
and find out which contour technique is

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.219 
and find out which contour technique is
the<00:02:01.370> best<00:02:01.580> one<00:02:01.820> for<00:02:01.850> you<00:02:02.270> but<00:02:02.750> this<00:02:02.870> is<00:02:03.049> just

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
the best one for you but this is just

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.230 
the best one for you but this is just
the<00:02:03.320> one<00:02:03.440> that<00:02:03.470> I<00:02:03.650> like<00:02:03.950> to<00:02:03.979> do

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
the one that I like to do

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.520 
the one that I like to do
and<00:02:07.550> as<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.729> can<00:02:08.880> see<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:09.390> applied<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:10.080> dark

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
and as you can see I applied a dark

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.250 
and as you can see I applied a dark
shade<00:02:10.890> first<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.850> then<00:02:12.420> it<00:02:12.540> took<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.930> lighter

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
shade first and then it took a lighter

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.740 
shade first and then it took a lighter
shade<00:02:13.380> and<00:02:13.800> I<00:02:14.370> helped<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.880> blend<00:02:15.360> that<00:02:15.420> dark

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
shade and I helped to blend that dark

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.570 
shade and I helped to blend that dark
shade<00:02:15.990> into<00:02:16.350> my<00:02:16.470> skin<00:02:16.830> a<00:02:16.860> little<00:02:16.980> bit<00:02:17.310> on<00:02:17.459> the

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
shade into my skin a little bit on the

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.670 
shade into my skin a little bit on the
sides<00:02:17.819> because<00:02:18.569> if<00:02:18.780> I<00:02:18.870> just<00:02:19.080> applied<00:02:19.380> powder

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
sides because if I just applied powder

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.770 
sides because if I just applied powder
over<00:02:20.130> those<00:02:20.310> two<00:02:20.640> little<00:02:20.970> lines<00:02:21.150> that<00:02:21.630> we

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
over those two little lines that we

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.050 
over those two little lines that we
first<00:02:22.020> draw<00:02:22.380> it<00:02:22.920> would<00:02:23.190> look<00:02:23.310> a<00:02:23.489> little<00:02:23.760> bit

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
first draw it would look a little bit

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.940 
first draw it would look a little bit
ridiculous<00:02:24.510> so<00:02:24.959> this<00:02:25.260> is<00:02:25.410> just<00:02:25.500> going<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.709> help

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
ridiculous so this is just going to help

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.640 
ridiculous so this is just going to help
it<00:02:26.100> blend<00:02:26.550> in<00:02:26.880> a<00:02:27.030> lot<00:02:27.239> more<00:02:27.270> naturally<00:02:30.560> now<00:02:31.560> I'm

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
it blend in a lot more naturally now I'm

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.440 
it blend in a lot more naturally now I'm
just<00:02:31.800> taking<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:32.160> pressed<00:02:32.430> powder<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:32.970> setting

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.830 

but<00:02:42.890> wait<00:02:43.130> we're<00:02:43.400> not<00:02:43.550> done<00:02:43.820> yet<00:02:44.120> so<00:02:44.420> I<00:02:44.450> also

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
but wait we're not done yet so I also

have a powder contour kit that I'd like

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.330 
have a powder contour kit that I'd like
to<00:02:47.180> use<00:02:47.390> and<00:02:47.660> if<00:02:48.290> you're<00:02:48.440> going<00:02:48.560> to<00:02:48.650> ask<00:02:48.770> why<00:02:49.310> I

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
to use and if you're going to ask why I

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.670 
to use and if you're going to ask why I
use<00:02:49.640> both<00:02:49.880> is<00:02:50.150> because<00:02:50.540> I<00:02:50.720> like<00:02:51.200> to<00:02:51.380> first

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
use both is because I like to first

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.040 
use both is because I like to first
apply<00:02:52.100> the<00:02:52.160> cream<00:02:52.790> contour<00:02:53.360> because<00:02:53.540> if<00:02:53.930> we

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
apply the cream contour because if we

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.410 
apply the cream contour because if we
just<00:02:54.080> do<00:02:54.380> the<00:02:54.500> powder<00:02:54.770> it's<00:02:55.240> probably<00:02:56.240> going

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
just do the powder it's probably going

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.210 
just do the powder it's probably going
to<00:02:56.480> slide<00:02:56.780> around<00:02:56.960> and<00:02:57.440> come<00:02:57.620> off<00:02:57.830> throughout

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
to slide around and come off throughout

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.800 
to slide around and come off throughout
the<00:02:58.400> day<00:02:58.580> but<00:02:58.640> if<00:02:59.000> you<00:02:59.120> have<00:02:59.300> the<00:02:59.510> cream

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
the day but if you have the cream

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.690 
the day but if you have the cream
concealer<00:03:00.200> underneath<00:03:00.680> it's<00:03:01.340> going<00:03:01.430> to<00:03:01.520> help

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
concealer underneath it's going to help

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.120 
concealer underneath it's going to help
it<00:03:01.910> stay<00:03:02.180> a<00:03:02.210> lot<00:03:02.420> longer<00:03:02.750> but<00:03:03.590> if<00:03:03.770> you<00:03:03.860> applied

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
it stay a lot longer but if you applied

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.740 
it stay a lot longer but if you applied
the<00:03:04.250> powder<00:03:04.490> over<00:03:04.730> top<00:03:05.120> it's<00:03:05.360> going<00:03:05.540> to<00:03:05.630> make

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
the powder over top it's going to make

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.250 
the powder over top it's going to make
it<00:03:05.900> a<00:03:05.930> lot<00:03:06.140> more<00:03:06.290> dramatic<00:03:07.930> so<00:03:08.930> here<00:03:09.110> I'm<00:03:09.170> just

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
it a lot more dramatic so here I'm just

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.080 
it a lot more dramatic so here I'm just
going<00:03:09.440> over<00:03:09.920> at<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.130> same<00:03:10.370> areas<00:03:10.820> that<00:03:10.970> we

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
going over at the same areas that we

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.120 
going over at the same areas that we
concert<00:03:11.540> earlier<00:03:11.720> including<00:03:12.620> the<00:03:12.710> forehead

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
concert earlier including the forehead

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.950 
concert earlier including the forehead
samples<00:03:13.640> and<00:03:13.820> underneath<00:03:14.360> the<00:03:14.510> cheekbones

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:14.960 
samples and underneath the cheekbones

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.560 
samples and underneath the cheekbones
and<00:03:15.170> I'm<00:03:15.620> also<00:03:15.830> adding<00:03:16.190> it<00:03:16.550> underneath<00:03:16.940> my<00:03:17.120> jaw

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
and I'm also adding it underneath my jaw

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.260 
and I'm also adding it underneath my jaw
which<00:03:18.110> actually<00:03:18.680> helps<00:03:19.010> reduce<00:03:19.280> a<00:03:19.760> double

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
which actually helps reduce a double

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.920 
which actually helps reduce a double
chin<00:03:20.420> if<00:03:20.600> you<00:03:20.810> have<00:03:20.990> one<00:03:21.230> and<00:03:22.480> then<00:03:23.480> easy<00:03:23.750> way

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
chin if you have one and then easy way

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.600 
chin if you have one and then easy way
to<00:03:23.990> remember<00:03:24.440> this<00:03:24.770> if<00:03:25.010> you're<00:03:25.130> just<00:03:25.400> starting

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
to remember this if you're just starting

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.520 
to remember this if you're just starting
out<00:03:25.850> with<00:03:26.000> contour<00:03:26.540> is<00:03:26.720> the<00:03:27.200> three<00:03:27.500> e

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
out with contour is the three e

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.410 
out with contour is the three e
techniques<00:03:28.160> so<00:03:28.370> you<00:03:28.430> have<00:03:28.640> the<00:03:28.850> three<00:03:28.880> drawn

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
techniques so you have the three drawn

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.120 
techniques so you have the three drawn
on<00:03:29.570> one<00:03:29.780> side<00:03:30.050> and<00:03:30.260> they<00:03:30.440> eat<00:03:30.590> on<00:03:30.830> the<00:03:30.950> other
