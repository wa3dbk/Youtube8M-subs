00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
into a speed burst like this from the

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.840 
into a speed burst like this from the
offense<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:04.079> me<00:02:04.229> I'm<00:02:04.439> okay<00:02:04.619> if<00:02:05.219> we're<00:02:05.700> going<00:02:05.790> to

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
offense to me I'm okay if we're going to

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.700 
offense to me I'm okay if we're going to
do<00:02:06.030> something<00:02:06.420> like<00:02:06.450> this<00:02:06.780> because<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.530> would

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
do something like this because I would

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.260 
do something like this because I would
much<00:02:07.860> rather<00:02:07.920> have<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.550> player<00:02:09.000> out<00:02:09.030> of

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
much rather have a player out of

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.210 
much rather have a player out of
position<00:02:09.539> we<00:02:09.929> kept<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.379> position<00:02:10.860> then

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
position we kept that a position then

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.550 
position we kept that a position then
shift<00:02:11.550> back<00:02:11.790> into<00:02:11.819> it<00:02:12.239> but<00:02:12.690> again<00:02:12.780> I<00:02:12.930> know<00:02:13.050> some

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
shift back into it but again I know some

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.170 
shift back into it but again I know some
people<00:02:13.709> may<00:02:13.830> not<00:02:13.980> like<00:02:14.040> that<00:02:14.520> I<00:02:14.790> know

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
people may not like that I know

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.180 
people may not like that I know
obviously<00:02:15.569> I'd<00:02:16.380> like<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.800> see<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.069> little

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
obviously I'd like to see it a little

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.650 
obviously I'd like to see it a little
bit<00:02:17.400> cleaner<00:02:17.640> but<00:02:17.970> again<00:02:18.090> we're<00:02:18.390> talking

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
bit cleaner but again we're talking

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.300 
bit cleaner but again we're talking
about<00:02:18.780> end<00:02:19.020> results<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.709> me<00:02:19.830> I'm<00:02:19.950> okay

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
about end results and to me I'm okay

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.490 
about end results and to me I'm okay
with<00:02:20.849> something<00:02:21.209> like<00:02:21.360> that<00:02:21.569> occurring<00:02:21.989> now

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
with something like that occurring now

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.740 
with something like that occurring now
the<00:02:23.010> pursuit<00:02:23.370> angles<00:02:23.730> in<00:02:23.849> this<00:02:24.000> game<00:02:24.239> seem<00:02:24.599> to

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
the pursuit angles in this game seem to

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.030 
the pursuit angles in this game seem to
be<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:24.900> bit<00:02:25.080> better<00:02:25.349> and<00:02:25.470> this<00:02:25.590> is<00:02:25.770> a<00:02:25.800> great

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
be a bit better and this is a great

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.640 
be a bit better and this is a great
example<00:02:26.280> of<00:02:26.849> Carlos<00:02:27.569> Hyde<00:02:27.810> where<00:02:28.080> you<00:02:28.470> could

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
example of Carlos Hyde where you could

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.199 
example of Carlos Hyde where you could
go<00:02:28.770> back<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.010> watch<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.489> plethora<00:02:30.000> of<00:02:30.060> my

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
go back and watch a plethora of my

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.390 
go back and watch a plethora of my
madden<00:02:30.480> 15<00:02:30.599> videos<00:02:30.989> and<00:02:31.349> I'm<00:02:31.440> able<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.920> break

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
madden 15 videos and I'm able to break

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.370 
madden 15 videos and I'm able to break
this<00:02:32.580> off<00:02:32.790> for<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.090> longer<00:02:33.300> run<00:02:33.660> because<00:02:34.349> the

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
this off for a longer run because the

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.350 
this off for a longer run because the
corner<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.310> safety<00:02:35.730> doesn't<00:02:36.090> know<00:02:36.150> how<00:02:36.300> to

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
corner the safety doesn't know how to

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.870 
corner the safety doesn't know how to
react<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:37.349> me<00:02:37.500> turning<00:02:37.739> up<00:02:37.950> field<00:02:38.220> but<00:02:38.670> take<00:02:38.849> a

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
react to me turning up field but take a

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.589 
react to me turning up field but take a
look<00:02:39.000> here<00:02:39.180> at<00:02:39.569> a<00:02:39.660> pretty<00:02:40.410> seamless<00:02:41.599> pursuit

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
look here at a pretty seamless pursuit

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.960 
look here at a pretty seamless pursuit
angle<00:02:42.930> I<00:02:43.110> mean<00:02:43.709> just<00:02:43.920> watching<00:02:44.099> there<00:02:44.610> from

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
angle I mean just watching there from

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.250 
angle I mean just watching there from
where<00:02:45.090> you<00:02:45.209> know<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.450> handoff<00:02:45.810> happens

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
where you know the handoff happens

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.979 
where you know the handoff happens
doesn't<00:02:46.530> attack<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.130> gap<00:02:47.540> reads<00:02:48.540> where<00:02:48.840> the

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
doesn't attack the gap reads where the

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.229 
doesn't attack the gap reads where the
running<00:02:49.260> back<00:02:49.410> is<00:02:49.620> we're<00:02:49.769> going<00:02:49.950> turns<00:02:50.940> his

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
running back is we're going turns his

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.840 
running back is we're going turns his
body<00:02:51.630> outside<00:02:51.959> and<00:02:52.650> then<00:02:52.769> one<00:02:53.069> angle<00:02:53.459> this<00:02:53.670> is

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
body outside and then one angle this is

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.340 
body outside and then one angle this is
something<00:02:54.150> we<00:02:54.269> preach<00:02:54.569> when<00:02:54.840> we<00:02:54.959> talked<00:02:55.170> about

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
something we preach when we talked about

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.670 
something we preach when we talked about
2k5<00:02:56.030> essentially<00:02:57.030> one<00:02:57.269> angle<00:02:57.600> out<00:02:57.750> picks<00:02:58.500> up

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
2k5 essentially one angle out picks up

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.320 
2k5 essentially one angle out picks up
the<00:02:58.799> ball<00:02:58.830> carrier<00:02:59.340> puts<00:02:59.790> them<00:02:59.910> down<00:02:59.940> into<00:03:00.180> the

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
the ball carrier puts them down into the

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.550 
the ball carrier puts them down into the
ground<00:03:00.360> that's<00:03:00.690> what<00:03:00.870> you<00:03:00.989> want<00:03:01.170> to<00:03:01.260> see<00:03:01.410> the

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
ground that's what you want to see the

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.890 
ground that's what you want to see the
other<00:03:01.650> thing<00:03:01.980> just<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:02.280> key<00:03:02.519> on<00:03:02.549> this<00:03:02.790> last<00:03:03.060> you

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
other thing just to key on this last you

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.380 
other thing just to key on this last you
take<00:03:04.080> a<00:03:04.110> look<00:03:04.319> at<00:03:04.549> bouldin<00:03:05.549> coming<00:03:06.030> out<00:03:06.150> here

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
take a look at bouldin coming out here

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.930 
take a look at bouldin coming out here
and<00:03:06.599> just<00:03:06.630> sits<00:03:07.110> down<00:03:07.349> the<00:03:08.250> safety<00:03:08.670> that's

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
and just sits down the safety that's

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.610 
and just sits down the safety that's
what<00:03:09.120> you<00:03:09.239> want<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:09.480> see<00:03:09.660> you<00:03:10.140> know<00:03:10.230> I<00:03:10.260> want<00:03:10.560> to
