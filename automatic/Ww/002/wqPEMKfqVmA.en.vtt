00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.930 
at its best I highly suggest that you
use<00:03:19.090> him<00:03:19.570> at<00:03:19.780> left<00:03:20.140> forward<00:03:20.650> you<00:03:21.040> will<00:03:21.250> get<00:03:21.489> the

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
use him at left forward you will get the

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.790 
use him at left forward you will get the
most<00:03:22.120> out<00:03:22.390> of<00:03:22.420> all<00:03:22.660> the<00:03:22.870> insane<00:03:23.290> parts<00:03:23.650> I

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
most out of all the insane parts I

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.650 
most out of all the insane parts I
talked<00:03:24.100> about<00:03:24.220> in<00:03:24.519> this<00:03:24.640> card<00:03:24.910> if<00:03:25.090> you<00:03:25.150> put<00:03:25.570> him

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
talked about in this card if you put him

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.780 
talked about in this card if you put him
at<00:03:25.750> left<00:03:25.959> wing<00:03:26.080> he<00:03:26.620> won't<00:03:26.860> be<00:03:26.980> bad<00:03:27.250> however<00:03:27.700> I

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
at left wing he won't be bad however I

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.460 
at left wing he won't be bad however I
found<00:03:28.090> new<00:03:28.300> to<00:03:28.450> be<00:03:28.540> out<00:03:28.690> of<00:03:28.810> position<00:03:28.930> at<00:03:29.260> times

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
found new to be out of position at times

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.530 
found new to be out of position at times
left<00:03:30.100> men<00:03:30.310> would<00:03:30.489> be<00:03:30.610> even<00:03:30.970> worse<00:03:31.120> because<00:03:31.360> you

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
left men would be even worse because you

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.150 
left men would be even worse because you
won't<00:03:31.720> get<00:03:31.870> the<00:03:32.290> attacking<00:03:32.650> part<00:03:32.980> of<00:03:33.040> this

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
won't get the attacking part of this

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.070 
won't get the attacking part of this
card<00:03:33.400> as<00:03:33.580> much<00:03:34.239> and<00:03:34.420> he's<00:03:34.510> not<00:03:34.660> much<00:03:34.870> of<00:03:34.900> a

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
card as much and he's not much of a

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.620 
card as much and he's not much of a
defender<00:03:35.500> at<00:03:35.650> all<00:03:36.280> for<00:03:36.880> the<00:03:36.940> final<00:03:37.090> rating<00:03:37.420> i'm

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
defender at all for the final rating i'm

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.920 
defender at all for the final rating i'm
going<00:03:37.840> to<00:03:37.959> give<00:03:38.110> inform<00:03:38.709> memphis<00:03:39.130> to<00:03:39.280> pay<00:03:39.459> a

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
going to give inform memphis to pay a

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.970 
going to give inform memphis to pay a
nine-point-oh<00:03:40.930> added<00:03:41.230> sin<00:03:41.410> i<00:03:41.440> definitely

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
nine-point-oh added sin i definitely

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.350 
nine-point-oh added sin i definitely
think<00:03:42.100> he<00:03:42.310> is<00:03:42.430> worth<00:03:42.670> the<00:03:42.850> money<00:03:42.970> because<00:03:43.239> he

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
think he is worth the money because he

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.420 
think he is worth the money because he
could<00:03:43.630> be<00:03:43.780> a<00:03:43.810> difference<00:03:44.470> maker<00:03:44.590> on<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.190> pitch

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
could be a difference maker on the pitch

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.160 
could be a difference maker on the pitch
yes<00:03:45.940> he<00:03:46.060> does<00:03:46.239> have<00:03:46.450> some<00:03:46.480> flaws<00:03:46.870> but<00:03:47.110> I

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
yes he does have some flaws but I

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.900 
yes he does have some flaws but I
believe<00:03:47.500> if<00:03:47.860> you<00:03:48.040> put<00:03:48.220> him<00:03:48.310> in<00:03:48.400> at<00:03:48.640> left

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
believe if you put him in at left

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.330 
believe if you put him in at left
forward<00:03:49.299> he<00:03:49.660> will<00:03:49.810> have<00:03:49.989> great<00:03:50.680> success<00:03:50.950> for

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
forward he will have great success for

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.710 
forward he will have great success for
