the most bioavailable protein is when

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.390 
the most bioavailable protein is when
you're<00:02:36.970> eating<00:02:37.150> greens<00:02:37.750> you<00:02:38.560> get<00:02:38.800> all<00:02:39.190> the

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
you're eating greens you get all the

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.970 
you're eating greens you get all the
amino<00:02:39.730> acids<00:02:40.180> that<00:02:40.270> you<00:02:40.510> need<00:02:40.720> and<00:02:41.020> that's<00:02:41.830> the

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
amino acids that you need and that's the

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.740 
amino acids that you need and that's the
proteins<00:02:42.459> and<00:02:43.590> so<00:02:44.590> you<00:02:45.580> don't<00:02:45.760> it's<00:02:46.569> not

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
proteins and so you don't it's not

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.690 
proteins and so you don't it's not
necessary<00:02:47.260> to<00:02:47.350> get<00:02:47.620> it<00:02:47.709> from<00:02:48.160> anywhere<00:02:48.519> else

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
necessary to get it from anywhere else

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.460 
necessary to get it from anywhere else
because<00:02:49.239> especially<00:02:49.600> from<00:02:49.959> animal<00:02:50.260> products

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
because especially from animal products

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.589 
because especially from animal products
because<00:02:51.040> then<00:02:51.550> the<00:02:51.670> body<00:02:51.819> has<00:02:52.060> to<00:02:52.090> deal<00:02:52.390> with

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
because then the body has to deal with

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.120 
because then the body has to deal with
that<00:02:52.780> it's<00:02:53.170> a<00:02:53.200> good<00:02:53.319> way<00:02:53.440> to<00:02:53.500> get<00:02:53.680> more<00:02:53.890> greens

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
that it's a good way to get more greens

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.770 
that it's a good way to get more greens
than<00:02:54.400> you<00:02:54.489> would<00:02:54.610> normally<00:02:54.940> eat<00:02:55.090> because

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
than you would normally eat because

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.479 
than you would normally eat because
we've<00:02:55.959> put<00:02:56.140> enough<00:02:56.380> silver<00:02:56.860> beet<00:02:57.100> in<00:02:57.280> there

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
we've put enough silver beet in there

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.100 
we've put enough silver beet in there
that<00:02:57.700> most<00:02:58.030> people<00:02:58.330> wouldn't<00:02:58.480> even<00:02:58.630> eat<00:02:58.930> with

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
that most people wouldn't even eat with

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.220 
that most people wouldn't even eat with
one<00:02:59.319> sitting<00:02:59.799> so<00:03:00.060> for<00:03:01.060> us<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.360> greens<00:03:01.630> is<00:03:02.080> the

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
one sitting so for us the greens is the

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.530 
one sitting so for us the greens is the
way<00:03:02.319> to<00:03:02.380> get<00:03:02.560> the<00:03:02.680> proteins<00:03:03.160> that<00:03:03.430> all<00:03:04.269> the

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
way to get the proteins that all the

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.530 
way to get the proteins that all the
minerals<00:03:04.900> nutrients<00:03:05.760> like<00:03:06.760> that<00:03:07.000> because

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
minerals nutrients like that because

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.539 
minerals nutrients like that because
it's<00:03:08.110> immediately<00:03:08.830> available<00:03:09.010> to<00:03:09.459> us<00:03:11.549> we've

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
it's immediately available to us we've

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.670 
it's immediately available to us we've
run<00:03:12.790> the<00:03:13.120> length<00:03:13.239> of<00:03:13.450> New<00:03:13.569> Zealand<00:03:13.930> before<00:03:14.290> so

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
run the length of New Zealand before so

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.479 
run the length of New Zealand before so
we<00:03:15.400> did<00:03:15.610> that<00:03:16.290> to<00:03:17.290> bring<00:03:17.500> awareness<00:03:17.620> for<00:03:18.220> other

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
we did that to bring awareness for other

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.039 
we did that to bring awareness for other
people<00:03:18.910> who<00:03:19.180> you<00:03:19.569> know<00:03:19.660> people<00:03:19.959> with

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
people who you know people with

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.250 
people who you know people with
disabilities<00:03:20.650> and<00:03:21.299> and<00:03:22.299> here<00:03:22.750> it's<00:03:23.019> really

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
disabilities and and here it's really

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.650 
disabilities and and here it's really
just<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:24.370> inspirations<00:03:24.970> being<00:03:25.269> that<00:03:25.510> we've

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
just the inspirations being that we've

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.199 
just the inspirations being that we've
made<00:03:25.870> a<00:03:25.900> lot<00:03:26.109> of<00:03:26.140> changes<00:03:26.769> through<00:03:27.340> different

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
made a lot of changes through different

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.539 
made a lot of changes through different
choices<00:03:28.750> that<00:03:28.930> we've<00:03:29.109> made<00:03:29.380> and<00:03:29.709> wanting<00:03:30.519> to

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
choices that we've made and wanting to

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.640 
choices that we've made and wanting to
share<00:03:30.850> that<00:03:31.000> with<00:03:31.209> others<00:03:31.480> and<00:03:31.690> showing

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
share that with others and showing

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.520 
share that with others and showing
people<00:03:32.680> how<00:03:33.269> it<00:03:34.269> can<00:03:34.510> make<00:03:34.540> a<00:03:34.750> huge<00:03:35.079> difference

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
people how it can make a huge difference

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.890 
people how it can make a huge difference
for<00:03:35.620> their<00:03:36.609> own<00:03:36.760> health<00:03:37.030> and<00:03:37.269> in<00:03:37.570> the<00:03:37.750> health

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
for their own health and in the health

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.380 
for their own health and in the health
of<00:03:38.019> others

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.420 

we've<00:03:43.750> got<00:03:43.870> two<00:03:44.110> two<00:03:44.590> crew<00:03:44.799> members<00:03:44.950> we've<00:03:45.310> got

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
we've got two two crew members we've got

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.309 
we've got two two crew members we've got
two<00:03:45.580> vehicles<00:03:45.760> so<00:03:46.330> one<00:03:46.540> vehicles<00:03:46.959> towing<00:03:47.290> a

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
two vehicles so one vehicles towing a

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:48.000 
two vehicles so one vehicles towing a
caravan

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
caravan

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.610 
caravan
so<00:03:48.400> got<00:03:48.549> basically<00:03:49.390> there's<00:03:49.629> two<00:03:49.989> people

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
so got basically there's two people

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.449 
so got basically there's two people
driving<00:03:51.129> and<00:03:51.310> they're<00:03:52.150> also<00:03:53.310> pretty<00:03:54.310> much

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
driving and they're also pretty much

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:55.920 
driving and they're also pretty much
doing<00:03:54.730> everything<00:03:54.940> else<00:03:55.330> we're<00:03:55.629> doing<00:03:55.750> the

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
doing everything else we're doing the

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.180 
doing everything else we're doing the
running<00:03:56.170> and<00:03:56.290> they<00:03:56.349> do<00:03:56.409> everything<00:03:56.769> else<00:03:56.980> that

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
running and they do everything else that

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.710 
running and they do everything else that
we're<00:03:57.310> preparing<00:03:57.640> the<00:03:57.790> food<00:03:57.970> and<00:03:58.239> buying<00:03:58.629> the

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
we're preparing the food and buying the

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.050 
we're preparing the food and buying the
food<00:03:58.870> and<00:03:59.230> pushing<00:04:00.129> us<00:04:00.220> out<00:04:00.340> the<00:04:00.489> door<00:04:00.670> and

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
food and pushing us out the door and

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:08.550 
food and pushing us out the door and
that<00:04:01.420> sort<00:04:02.230> of<00:04:02.260> thing<00:04:02.409> so<00:04:02.440> that's<00:04:02.799> great

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.800 

we<00:04:09.370> do<00:04:09.460> encounter<00:04:09.760> a<00:04:09.970> lot<00:04:10.150> of<00:04:10.240> people<00:04:10.540> whose

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
we do encounter a lot of people whose

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.500 
we do encounter a lot of people whose
you<00:04:11.410> know<00:04:11.520> their<00:04:12.520> response<00:04:12.940> to<00:04:13.210> what<00:04:13.360> we're

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
you know their response to what we're

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.660 
you know their response to what we're
doing<00:04:13.840> is<00:04:14.200> that<00:04:14.230> all<00:04:14.680> you<00:04:14.800> must<00:04:14.950> be<00:04:15.070> crazy<00:04:15.340> or

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
doing is that all you must be crazy or

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.170 
doing is that all you must be crazy or
or<00:04:16.180> that<00:04:16.890> you<00:04:17.890> know<00:04:18.010> how<00:04:18.220> is<00:04:18.640> it<00:04:18.670> possible<00:04:19.120> that

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
or that you know how is it possible that

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.270 
or that you know how is it possible that
you<00:04:19.359> can<00:04:19.510> do<00:04:19.630> that<00:04:19.840> but<00:04:20.109> the<00:04:20.799> majority<00:04:21.070> of

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
you can do that but the majority of

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.460 
you can do that but the majority of
people<00:04:21.430> are<00:04:21.700> inspired<00:04:22.210> by<00:04:22.420> what<00:04:22.690> we're<00:04:23.110> doing

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
people are inspired by what we're doing
