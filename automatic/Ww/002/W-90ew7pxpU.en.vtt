was do this the student stuff hope it
can't<00:00:10.469> help<00:00:10.679> it<00:00:10.860> okay<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:11.820> so<00:00:12.000> today<00:00:12.210> we're

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
can't help it okay and so today we're

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.570 
can't help it okay and so today we're
here<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.690> talk<00:00:12.900> about<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.740> delayed<00:00:14.070> update<00:00:14.429> I

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
here to talk about the delayed update I

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.410 
here to talk about the delayed update I
guess<00:00:14.759> because<00:00:14.910> it's<00:00:14.969> happened<00:00:15.299> like<00:00:15.330> three

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
guess because it's happened like three

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.890 
guess because it's happened like three
days<00:00:15.780> ago<00:00:15.960> about<00:00:16.550> Vox<00:00:17.550> lean<00:00:17.850> asteroids<00:00:18.390> this

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
days ago about Vox lean asteroids this

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.990 
days ago about Vox lean asteroids this
idea<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.650> believe<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.220> came<00:00:20.369> from<00:00:20.609> medieval

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
idea I believe it came from medieval

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.060 
idea I believe it came from medieval
engineers<00:00:21.210> am<00:00:21.660> i<00:00:21.720> right<00:00:21.900> I<00:00:22.080> might<00:00:22.320> not<00:00:22.619> right<00:00:22.830> I

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
engineers am i right I might not right I

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.910 
engineers am i right I might not right I
think<00:00:23.850> so<00:00:24.029> I<00:00:24.210> saw<00:00:24.510> levoxyl<00:00:24.990> entering<00:00:25.380> in<00:00:25.560> their

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
think so I saw levoxyl entering in their

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.070 
think so I saw levoxyl entering in their
medieval<00:00:26.279> engineers<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:27.119> I<00:00:27.240> thought<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:27.599> was

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
medieval engineers and I thought it was

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.960 
medieval engineers and I thought it was
implemented<00:00:28.470> in<00:00:28.710> here<00:00:29.010> so<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:29.699> may<00:00:29.789> believe

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
implemented in here so you may believe

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.030 
implemented in here so you may believe
that<00:00:30.090> this<00:00:30.330> is<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.570> normal<00:00:30.929> asteroid<00:00:31.470> but<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:31.859> is

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
that this is a normal asteroid but it is

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.459 
that this is a normal asteroid but it is
not<00:00:32.279> we<00:00:32.759> have<00:00:32.880> arcs<00:00:33.210> lit<00:00:33.510> not<00:00:33.960> drilled<00:00:34.320> it

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
not we have arcs lit not drilled it

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.530 
not we have arcs lit not drilled it
specifically<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.370> that<00:00:35.399> we<00:00:35.610> can<00:00:35.760> fit<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.120> ship

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
specifically so that we can fit a ship

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.209 
specifically so that we can fit a ship
inside<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.200> where<00:00:37.380> does<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.620> entrance<00:00:37.980> oh

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
inside and where does the entrance oh

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.270 
inside and where does the entrance oh
there<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.149> is<00:00:39.320> there<00:00:40.320> we<00:00:40.500> go<00:00:40.649> we<00:00:40.800> fit<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:40.980> whole

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
there it is there we go we fit a whole

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.520 
there it is there we go we fit a whole
full-size<00:00:42.210> ship<00:00:42.540> inside<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:43.110> asteroid

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
full-size ship inside of this asteroid

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.170 
full-size ship inside of this asteroid
here<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.070> this<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.550> just<00:00:44.670> one<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:45.030> the

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
here and this is just one of the

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.310 
here and this is just one of the
possibilities<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.780> could<00:00:45.930> be<00:00:46.020> doing<00:00:46.230> with

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
possibilities you could be doing with

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.290 
possibilities you could be doing with
this<00:00:46.379> update<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:47.190> could<00:00:47.370> be<00:00:47.489> making<00:00:47.670> stations

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
this update you could be making stations

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.090 
this update you could be making stations
that<00:00:48.510> are<00:00:48.570> well-protected<00:00:49.079> well<00:00:49.620> armored

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
that are well-protected well armored

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.459 
that are well-protected well armored
with<00:00:50.219> this<00:00:50.430> asteroid<00:00:51.300> substance<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.170> push<00:00:52.350> it

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
with this asteroid substance of push it

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.319 
with this asteroid substance of push it
a<00:00:52.500> little<00:00:52.559> gap<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.129> can<00:00:53.309> fill<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.579> in<00:00:53.699> easy

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
a little gap that I can fill it in easy

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.400 
a little gap that I can fill it in easy
because<00:00:54.809> we<00:00:54.930> can<00:00:55.079> Fox<00:00:55.350> lit<00:00:55.680> but<00:00:56.309> all<00:00:57.210> better<00:00:57.750> no

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
because we can Fox lit but all better no

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.619 
because we can Fox lit but all better no
problems<00:00:58.920> what<00:00:59.879> do<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.000> guys<00:01:00.270> think<00:01:00.329> about

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
problems what do you guys think about

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.799 
problems what do you guys think about

the future fourth one giving him your
expectations<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.210> say<00:01:06.420> easier<00:01:07.140> asteroid<00:01:07.860> basis

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
expectations I say easier asteroid basis

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.630 
expectations I say easier asteroid basis
and<00:01:08.939> hangers<00:01:09.299> oh<00:01:09.540> yeah<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.260> but<00:01:11.070> what<00:01:11.610> you

with this art we could do space

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.740 
with this art we could do space

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
engineers art sculpting sculptures yeah

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.690 
engineers art sculpting sculptures yeah
we<00:01:49.110> will<00:01:49.439> shoot<00:01:49.680> some<00:01:49.950> things<00:01:50.189> here<00:01:50.399> so<00:01:50.579> they

with a flat surface here
oh<00:02:07.120> that's<00:02:08.120> high<00:02:08.270> depth<00:02:11.710> look<00:02:12.710> at<00:02:12.890> that<00:02:13.130> I

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
oh that's high depth look at that I

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
oh that's high depth look at that I
don't<00:02:15.320> know<00:02:15.380> why<00:02:15.470> is<00:02:15.530> it<00:02:15.650> black<00:02:15.830> stuffs<00:02:16.160> there

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
oh well I thought there was a way that

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.260 
oh well I thought there was a way that
you<00:02:19.670> can<00:02:19.790> lock<00:02:20.060> it<00:02:20.330> to<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.900> UM<00:02:22.690> was<00:02:23.690> it<00:02:23.840> cold

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
you can lock it to the UM was it cold

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.840 
you can lock it to the UM was it cold
make<00:02:26.270> it<00:02:26.450> a<00:02:26.480> flat<00:02:26.750> level<00:02:26.960> plane<00:02:27.410> yeah<00:02:27.890> choose

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
make it a flat level plane yeah choose

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.540 
make it a flat level plane yeah choose
access<00:02:29.390> there<00:02:29.750> is<00:02:29.840> a<00:02:29.870> way<00:02:30.790> all<00:02:31.790> right<00:02:33.520> there<00:02:34.520> we

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
access there is a way all right there we

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.520 
access there is a way all right there we
go<00:02:36.190> then<00:02:37.190> we'll<00:02:37.340> meet<00:02:37.460> this<00:02:37.550> nice<00:02:37.790> and<00:02:38.030> flat

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
go then we'll meet this nice and flat

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
go then we'll meet this nice and flat
that's<00:02:39.530> pretty<00:02:40.150> hey<00:02:41.650> and<00:02:42.650> does<00:02:43.070> thruster

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
that's pretty hey and does thruster

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.700 
that's pretty hey and does thruster
distress<00:02:44.240> is<00:02:44.390> your<00:02:44.540> damage<00:02:44.750> to<00:02:44.960> asteroids<00:02:45.500> I

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
distress is your damage to asteroids I

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.090 
distress is your damage to asteroids I
bet<00:02:46.490> I<00:02:46.520> can<00:02:46.670> see<00:02:46.940> now<00:02:47.090> I'm<00:02:47.270> trying<00:02:47.690> my<00:02:47.900> best

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
bet I can see now I'm trying my best

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.380 
bet I can see now I'm trying my best
perfect<00:02:49.100> and<00:02:49.310> I<00:02:49.580> don't<00:02:49.730> think<00:02:49.790> it<00:02:49.940> ricochets

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
perfect and I don't think it ricochets

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.930 
perfect and I don't think it ricochets
up<00:02:50.540> rehearse<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:51.080> engines<00:02:51.680> either<00:02:51.890> this<00:02:52.730> will

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
up rehearse the engines either this will

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.030 
up rehearse the engines either this will
probably<00:02:53.510> a<00:02:53.660> more<00:02:53.900> preferable<00:02:54.410> way<00:02:54.470> to<00:02:54.620> land

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
probably a more preferable way to land

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.950 
probably a more preferable way to land
