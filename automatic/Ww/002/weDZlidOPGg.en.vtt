00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.989
 lets go see it 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.940
 if you do not have it just like something else 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.480
 as long as you can write and put 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.670
 Photos 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.840

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.840
 drag a photo 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.530
 we can remove this 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:52.310
 yes 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:55.660
 and here we have the chalk face 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.660
 let's increase it a little bit 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:03.810
 let's add a text 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.810
 than the ol because not the one to eliminate it 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.620
 now 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.220
 with that name 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.220
 Let's see 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.200
 new in uppercase 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:24.240
 l 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:28.320
 join the power 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:30.240
 of the chalk 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.409
 for something 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:36.240
 the color I'm going to put 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:39.770
 for example d 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:42.940
 blue we see no no no no no 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.940
 and I will put 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:50.699
 it would be nice to continue the red 

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:54.349
 we turn it around and well come on let's mediate 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:54.349
 is the background sends to the fund 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:00.009
 let's see if we're going to do if a little 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:03.749
 A) Yes 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:12.950
 and we would be going down a bit is a 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:16.270
 little shabby but in the end it looks good with 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.270
 I do not like the color much 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.820
 and I think that better 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.610
 the color that is better and this in 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.550
 green 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.789
 and now we're going to take out the other 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.789
 golazo 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:36.740
 let's solve it well 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.740
 and I would be 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.000

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:45.330

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:48.080
 desk 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:51.610

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:54.940
 good we give you to save 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:57.340
 freeze all this as not accept it 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:00.030
 but we can erase 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:03.590
 we can also erase it 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:06.890
 we would also have that 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:09.080
