00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
to record anything so it takes me a

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.450 
to record anything so it takes me a
little<00:02:08.110> bit<00:02:08.229> to<00:02:08.350> get<00:02:08.440> this<00:02:08.619> first<00:02:08.830> time<00:02:09.070> last

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
little bit to get this first time last

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.410 
little bit to get this first time last
night<00:02:09.729> over<00:02:10.060> storm<00:02:10.300> and<00:02:10.420> I<00:02:10.479> we're<00:02:10.780> doing<00:02:11.080> it

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
night over storm and I we're doing it

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.770 
night over storm and I we're doing it
may<00:02:13.420> be<00:02:13.480> four<00:02:14.230> times<00:02:14.470> every<00:02:15.130> eight<00:02:15.310> minutes<00:02:15.780> so

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
may be four times every eight minutes so

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.020 
may be four times every eight minutes so
it's<00:02:17.620> something<00:02:17.890> that's<00:02:18.190> a<00:02:18.280> lot<00:02:18.490> harder<00:02:18.820> than

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
it's something that's a lot harder than

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.670 
it's something that's a lot harder than
to<00:02:19.510> do<00:02:20.250> but<00:02:21.250> it<00:02:21.970> does<00:02:22.270> open<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.840> door<00:02:23.020> for<00:02:23.380> new
