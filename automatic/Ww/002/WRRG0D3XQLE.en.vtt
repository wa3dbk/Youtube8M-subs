some of them didn't fill up seems to be

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
holding these are not reusable once

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.280

you're<00:01:18.170> done<00:01:18.320> using<00:01:18.530> this<00:01:18.800> is<00:01:19.040> basically<00:01:19.850> junk

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.550 

now<00:01:24.290> holding<00:01:24.650> the<00:01:24.710> water<00:01:25.810> only<00:01:26.810> filling<00:01:27.260> up<00:01:27.410> to

now holding the water only filling up to
this<00:01:27.680> big<00:01:28.040> I<00:01:28.250> mean<00:01:28.400> I<00:01:28.580> guess<00:01:28.850> it's<00:01:29.030> big<00:01:29.210> enough

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
this big I mean I guess it's big enough

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:50.460 
this big I mean I guess it's big enough
up<00:01:31.460> that<00:01:31.670> one<00:01:31.790> has<00:01:31.910> a<00:01:31.940> hole<00:01:32.210> in<00:01:32.240> it

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.510 

these<00:01:51.470> actually<00:01:51.710> look<00:01:51.890> like<00:01:52.130> you're<00:01:52.280> filling

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
these actually look like you're filling

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.440 
these actually look like you're filling
up<00:01:52.610> evenly<00:01:53.210> so<00:01:54.850> hopefully<00:01:55.850> these<00:01:55.940> will<00:01:56.000> work

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
up evenly so hopefully these will work

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.540 
up evenly so hopefully these will work
ooh

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
ooh

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:06.010 
ooh
we<00:01:58.850> start<00:01:59.120> getting<00:01:59.210> heavy<00:02:04.450> there<00:02:05.450> we<00:02:05.570> go

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
we start getting heavy there we go

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.980 
we start getting heavy there we go
I<00:02:06.250> had<00:02:07.250> a<00:02:07.280> ton<00:02:07.670> of<00:02:07.700> failed<00:02:08.179> ones<00:02:08.450> as<00:02:08.690> you<00:02:08.720> can

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
I had a ton of failed ones as you can

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.900 
I had a ton of failed ones as you can
see<00:02:09.940> but<00:02:10.940> most<00:02:11.540> of<00:02:11.660> them<00:02:11.810> kept<00:02:12.020> their<00:02:12.200> water

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
see but most of them kept their water

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.030 
see but most of them kept their water
it's<00:02:13.910> doing<00:02:14.120> a<00:02:14.180> pretty<00:02:14.300> good<00:02:14.450> job<00:02:14.600> I<00:02:15.080> gotta<00:02:15.800> say

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
it's doing a pretty good job I gotta say

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.130 
it's doing a pretty good job I gotta say
the<00:02:16.190> product<00:02:16.730> pretty<00:02:17.030> good<00:02:17.300> I<00:02:17.330> mean<00:02:17.660> it<00:02:17.959> wasn't

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
the product pretty good I mean it wasn't

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.680 
the product pretty good I mean it wasn't
perfect<00:02:18.740> like<00:02:18.890> I<00:02:19.010> said<00:02:22.120> but<00:02:23.120> there<00:02:23.510> was<00:02:23.600> only

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
perfect like I said but there was only

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.330 
perfect like I said but there was only
10<00:02:23.989> bucks<00:02:24.200> and<00:02:24.440> you<00:02:24.500> get<00:02:24.590> a<00:02:24.650> hundred<00:02:24.830> balloons

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
10 bucks and you get a hundred balloons

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.920 
10 bucks and you get a hundred balloons
I<00:02:25.580> guess<00:02:25.730> it's<00:02:25.910> a<00:02:25.970> pretty<00:02:26.000> good<00:02:26.390> price<00:02:26.630> if<00:02:26.870> you

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
I guess it's a pretty good price if you

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.720 
I guess it's a pretty good price if you
don't<00:02:27.110> want<00:02:27.230> to<00:02:27.290> tie<00:02:27.500> a<00:02:27.530> balloon<00:02:27.800> for<00:02:28.370> me<00:02:28.489> it's

don't want to tie a balloon for me it's

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.290 
don't want to tie a balloon for me it's
not<00:02:28.940> worth<00:02:29.150> it<00:02:29.450> I<00:02:30.520> have<00:02:31.520> no<00:02:31.670> problem<00:02:32.060> tying

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.360 
not worth it I have no problem tying
balloons<00:02:32.480> and<00:02:32.900> you<00:02:32.959> get<00:02:33.110> like<00:02:33.230> 500<00:02:33.560> them<00:02:34.160> for

balloons and you get like 500 them for

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.240 
balloons and you get like 500 them for
like<00:02:34.489> 5<00:02:34.880> bucks<00:02:35.350> sit<00:02:36.350> they<00:02:36.739> just<00:02:36.890> put<00:02:37.070> a<00:02:37.100> little

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
like 5 bucks sit they just put a little

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.360 
like 5 bucks sit they just put a little
gasket<00:02:37.550> around<00:02:37.880> the<00:02:38.120> end<00:02:39.010> that's<00:02:40.010> probably

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
gasket around the end that's probably

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.479 
gasket around the end that's probably
why<00:02:40.489> they<00:02:40.640> leaked<00:02:41.650> most<00:02:42.650> of<00:02:42.830> them<00:02:42.950> did<00:02:43.220> hold

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
why they leaked most of them did hold

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.790 
why they leaked most of them did hold
