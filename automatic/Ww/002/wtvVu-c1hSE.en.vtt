00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:11.940
 now the fps the law to give little 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.950
 piu-piu xingu is from Jorge's species 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.190
 deserves more respect to the heaviest game 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.830
 and money called allen lady gaga you 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.020
 knows that you have a vargas board and 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.750
 earthly invention a little strange 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.300
 playing half time so scares me is that 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.420
 If it is, someone thinks it's strange until 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.520
 everyday people just find this tse e 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.930
 do not like faults in attention to others 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.309
 factor that is afraid means vain 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:42.480
 show the game when you have another 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:43.530
 subject that gave me an eye on the hand 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.050
 What is another game? 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.230
 gps you will have history 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.960
 sensational way of fighting aliens that 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.879
 they are arming they are causing danger 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.860
 terrestrial proportion then you will have 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.570
 that go there to love the base of the aliens 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.699
 try to finish them 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.489
 Smashing story but let's just talk 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.180
 a wee bit of numbers are ten guns 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.650
 present in the game since guns there but 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.090
 quiet if you have a school of 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.580
 spa you think are means 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.710
 strange because they are more diffuse and 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.810
 the shots a frozen product has other 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.729
 weapons that are very quarries that 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.100
 really can all in hand guns 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.619
 normal I thought the shots of these 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.740
 areas are kinda weak guy seems to know 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.590
 How will the shot happen? I shot it well. 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.030
 slow is that neither the game of psdb the son 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.710
 that the guy was shot already owned the 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.140
 other side not the ball goes in time 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.140
 to divert for example is kinda weird 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.619
 another thing that are fourteen phases inside 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.549
 friends there are alien signs inside the 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.470
 places 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.500
 there seems to be a human base but 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.740
 are the facilities organisms are also 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.110
 21 different enemies that will fight 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.939
 then have some games speak only game 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.549
 I have five different ones in the whole phase. 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.659
 It's not that 21 was too much but also 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.320
 it's not a bit 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.479
 it's already been eight that you're going to face 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.250
 them at the end of levels are not all 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.890
 levels because they are of 14 phases and 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.320
 but beauty is a species that uses a river 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.570
 in three then very well modeled well 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.660
 built a very solid game and it's cool 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.820
 dude if you want a quiet gps game 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.070
 that breaking up the ministers is tired 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.500
 to throw into question the second war 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.650
 world beauty the game is valid for you 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.840
 It has good atmospheric sounds good scenarios care 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.570
 very well built you look from afar 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.030
 one pulls what a beautiful place I am 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:38.170
 extraterrestrial place that the place of Fred 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:40.390
 the planet military installations in the 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.070
 Space cool, look, they talk. 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.650
 that is beautiful no game was made in a hurry 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.080
 only a game well succeeded but does not leave 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.500
 to be an fps like many others 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.500
 that already exist 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.430
 or
