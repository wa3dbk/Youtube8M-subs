you so you have manageability for the
next<00:03:30.329> move<00:03:30.540> okay<00:03:30.870> so<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.919> next<00:03:32.129> move<00:03:32.280> is<00:03:32.489> of

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
likely to lady did up did a snap right

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.210 
likely to lady did up did a snap right
here<00:03:47.519> you<00:03:48.090> can't<00:03:48.359> just<00:03:48.449> go<00:03:48.930> from<00:03:48.959> one<00:03:49.409> to<00:03:49.709> then

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
here you can't just go from one to then

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.899 
here you can't just go from one to then
do<00:03:50.519> two<00:03:50.819> and<00:03:51.060> try<00:03:51.269> and<00:03:51.389> unwind<00:03:51.810> her<00:03:52.849> for<00:03:53.849> this

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:53.909 
do two and try and unwind her for this

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:55.849 
do two and try and unwind her for this
move<00:03:54.150> it<00:03:54.329> just<00:03:54.780> doesn't<00:03:55.109> work<00:03:55.169> and<00:03:55.379> you<00:03:55.620> don't

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
move it just doesn't work and you don't

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.409 
move it just doesn't work and you don't
want<00:03:56.040> to<00:03:56.069> go<00:03:56.190> from<00:03:56.370> one<00:03:56.579> to<00:03:57.060> start<00:03:57.239> unwinding

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
want to go from one to start unwinding

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:58.819 
want to go from one to start unwinding
her<00:03:57.780> to<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:57.930> opposite<00:03:58.229> direction<00:03:58.349> because

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
her to the opposite direction because

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.219 
her to the opposite direction because
that<00:03:58.979> just<00:03:59.129> doesn't<00:03:59.250> work<00:03:59.459> to<00:03:59.879> onto<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:01.079> lady

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:01.229 
that just doesn't work to onto the lady

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:03.020 
that just doesn't work to onto the lady
just<00:04:01.440> can't<00:04:01.739> turn<00:04:01.949> that<00:04:02.069> way<00:04:02.280> especially<00:04:02.609> in

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
just can't turn that way especially in

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.119 
just can't turn that way especially in
this<00:04:03.150> position<00:04:03.569> you<00:04:04.229> what<00:04:04.409> you<00:04:04.530> need<00:04:04.680> to<00:04:04.799> do<00:04:04.919> is

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:05.129 
this position you what you need to do is

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:07.699 
this position you what you need to do is
that<00:04:05.370> from<00:04:05.669> one<00:04:05.909> you<00:04:06.479> have<00:04:06.780> to<00:04:07.019> remember<00:04:07.470> that

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
that from one you have to remember that

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.349 
that from one you have to remember that
the<00:04:07.919> lady<00:04:08.280> for<00:04:08.489> another<00:04:08.729> cross<00:04:08.939> body<00:04:09.120> would

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
the lady for another cross body would

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:11.500 
the lady for another cross body would
turn<00:04:09.389> which<00:04:09.959> is<00:04:09.989> really<00:04:10.439> what<00:04:10.590> this<00:04:10.859> unwinding

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
turn which is really what this unwinding

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.189 
turn which is really what this unwinding
mechanic<00:04:12.510> is<00:04:12.629> going<00:04:12.810> to<00:04:12.870> do

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:13.199 
mechanic is going to do

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:16.310 
mechanic is going to do
I<00:04:13.229> love<00:04:13.590> mechanics<00:04:14.099> and<00:04:14.400> I<00:04:14.459> guess<00:04:14.669> is<00:04:15.599> you<00:04:16.229> have

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
I love mechanics and I guess is you have

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.289 
I love mechanics and I guess is you have
to<00:04:16.440> wait<00:04:16.560> till<00:04:16.799> five<00:04:17.070> ladies<00:04:17.789> can<00:04:17.940> only<00:04:18.060> turn

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
to wait till five ladies can only turn

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.390 
to wait till five ladies can only turn
on<00:04:18.359> a<00:04:18.570> cross<00:04:18.780> bar<00:04:18.959> lead<00:04:19.079> on<00:04:19.169> five<00:04:19.440> right<00:04:19.829> so

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
on a cross bar lead on five right so

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.060 
on a cross bar lead on five right so
from<00:04:20.909> here<00:04:21.180> you<00:04:21.389> do<00:04:21.509> one<00:04:21.780> and<00:04:22.019> you<00:04:22.590> do<00:04:22.710> your<00:04:22.889> two

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
from here you do one and you do your two

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.339 
from here you do one and you do your two
counts<00:04:23.430> to<00:04:23.580> align<00:04:24.150> her<00:04:24.389> to<00:04:24.630> the<00:04:24.810> position<00:04:25.229> that

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:25.349 
counts to align her to the position that

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:28.159 
counts to align her to the position that
she<00:04:25.949> should<00:04:26.130> go<00:04:26.310> so<00:04:26.820> you<00:04:26.880> do<00:04:27.000> two<00:04:27.300> and<00:04:27.599> three

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
she should go so you do two and three

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.379 
she should go so you do two and three
from<00:04:29.130> here<00:04:29.190> now<00:04:29.669> that<00:04:29.880> you<00:04:29.970> know<00:04:30.090> the<00:04:30.210> next

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 
from here now that you know the next

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:32.899 
from here now that you know the next
count<00:04:30.570> is<00:04:30.659> five<00:04:30.930> you<00:04:31.590> can<00:04:31.770> now<00:04:31.919> unwind<00:04:32.520> her<00:04:32.760> to

00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:32.909 
count is five you can now unwind her to

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:35.600 
count is five you can now unwind her to
the<00:04:33.029> as<00:04:33.630> a<00:04:33.690> lady<00:04:33.990> turns<00:04:34.200> to<00:04:34.349> the<00:04:34.469> right<00:04:34.650> five

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
the as a lady turns to the right five

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.040 
the as a lady turns to the right five
six

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
six

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.219 
six
and<00:04:37.349> then<00:04:37.680> go<00:04:37.830> back<00:04:37.979> on<00:04:38.190> one<00:04:38.699> okay<00:04:39.210> so<00:04:39.690> let's

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
and then go back on one okay so let's

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:40.850 
and then go back on one okay so let's
look<00:04:40.379> at<00:04:40.500> that

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
look at that

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.619 
look at that
with<00:04:41.280> more<00:04:41.490> counsel<00:04:41.819> you<00:04:41.879> can<00:04:42.000> kind<00:04:42.150> of<00:04:42.210> let's

00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:42.629 
with more counsel you can kind of let's

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:44.719 
with more counsel you can kind of let's
see<00:04:42.750> what's<00:04:42.930> happening<00:04:43.050> so<00:04:43.860> we<00:04:44.099> go<00:04:44.220> forward<00:04:44.669> on

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
see what's happening so we go forward on

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:55.430 
see what's happening so we go forward on
