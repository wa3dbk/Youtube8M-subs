now<00:03:09.690> you<00:03:09.750> can<00:03:09.930> see<00:03:10.140> how<00:03:10.350> I<00:03:10.590> push<00:03:11.250> it<00:03:11.430> I<00:03:11.580> pull<00:03:12.000> it

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
now you can see how I push it I pull it

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.280 
now you can see how I push it I pull it
tight<00:03:12.420> and<00:03:13.280> push<00:03:14.280> it<00:03:14.460> against<00:03:14.850> her<00:03:15.000> body<00:03:15.180> so<00:03:16.110> it

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
tight and push it against her body so it

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.410 
tight and push it against her body so it
sticks<00:03:16.950> and<00:03:17.220> kind<00:03:17.400> of<00:03:17.490> molds<00:03:17.820> on<00:03:18.000> and<00:03:19.400> then<00:03:20.420> you

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
sticks and kind of molds on and then you

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.560 
sticks and kind of molds on and then you
bring<00:03:21.660> it<00:03:21.780> around<00:03:21.960> here<00:03:22.290> and<00:03:26.240> do<00:03:27.240> that<00:03:27.360> like

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
bring it around here and do that like

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.810 
bring it around here and do that like
that<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:27.870> then<00:03:28.670> you<00:03:29.670> see<00:03:29.910> I<00:03:29.940> kind<00:03:30.240> of<00:03:31.640> you<00:03:32.640> see

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 
piece kind of flops off like that you're

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.870 
piece kind of flops off like that you're
gonna<00:03:40.980> want<00:03:41.220> to<00:03:41.310> make<00:03:41.850> it<00:03:41.970> even<00:03:42.390> as<00:03:42.540> possible

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880

and then you're gonna want to take it
back<00:03:46.650> to<00:03:47.010> where<00:03:48.000> the<00:03:48.600> rocket<00:03:48.960> is<00:03:49.080> you're<00:03:49.920> gonna

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
back to where the rocket is you're gonna

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.540 
back to where the rocket is you're gonna
want<00:03:50.250> to<00:03:50.340> fold<00:03:50.640> it<00:03:50.850> back<00:03:51.120> over<00:03:51.450> and<00:03:51.980> then<00:03:52.980> do

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
and our little rocket jet pack now they

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.290 
and our little rocket jet pack now they
could<00:05:08.970> keep<00:05:09.150> going<00:05:09.390> for<00:05:09.660> more<00:05:09.870> strength<00:05:10.410> and

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
could keep going for more strength and

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:19.400 
could keep going for more strength and
we<00:05:12.300> could<00:05:12.570> but<00:05:13.320> I<00:05:14.120> am<00:05:15.120> NOT<00:05:15.810> going<00:05:16.260> to<00:05:18.410> okay
