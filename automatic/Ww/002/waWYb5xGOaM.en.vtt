point of view what is truly sustainable
energy<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.119> truly<00:02:06.840> sustainable<00:02:07.020> energy<00:02:07.829> is

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
don't take action right now what will

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.089 
don't take action right now what will
happen<00:02:18.000> is<00:02:18.480> you<00:02:18.750> will<00:02:18.959> start<00:02:19.110> building<00:02:19.560> up<00:02:19.920> a

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
happen is you will start building up a

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.369 
happen is you will start building up a
green<00:02:20.700> bubble<00:02:21.209> and<00:02:21.629> have<00:02:21.810> you<00:02:21.930> become<00:02:22.049> bigger

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
green bubble and have you become bigger

it will be heating up and we got to do

now<00:03:14.970> it<00:03:15.150> seems<00:03:15.450> that<00:03:15.569> you<00:03:16.200> almost<00:03:16.980> feel<00:03:17.519> that

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
now it seems that you almost feel that

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.809 
now it seems that you almost feel that
it's<00:03:18.150> actually<00:03:18.540> worse<00:03:18.810> for<00:03:19.199> the<00:03:19.980> green<00:03:20.220> sector

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
it's actually worse for the green sector

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.520 
it's actually worse for the green sector
if<00:03:21.000> we<00:03:21.180> keep<00:03:21.389> doing<00:03:21.780> what<00:03:21.930> we're<00:03:22.079> doing<00:03:22.139> now

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
if we keep doing what we're doing now

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.369 
if we keep doing what we're doing now
instead<00:03:23.280> of<00:03:23.340> trying<00:03:23.699> to<00:03:24.000> change<00:03:24.629> how<00:03:25.019> we<00:03:25.049> use

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 
instead of trying to change how we use

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.250 
instead of trying to change how we use
subsidies<00:03:25.980> and<00:03:26.129> so<00:03:26.310> on<00:03:26.690> absolutely<00:03:27.690> it<00:03:28.049> will

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
subsidies and so on absolutely it will

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
have a negative effect because you will

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.020 
have a negative effect because you will

access<00:04:27.810> to<00:04:27.840> satellites<00:04:28.680> will<00:04:29.190> come<00:04:29.400> cheaper

access to satellites will come cheaper

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.180 
access to satellites will come cheaper
and<00:04:30.000> we'll<00:04:30.720> all<00:04:30.840> benefit<00:04:31.260> from<00:04:31.320> it<00:04:31.590> but<00:04:31.980> most
