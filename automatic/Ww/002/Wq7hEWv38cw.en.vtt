00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
reviews I did find her at justice the

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.020 
reviews I did find her at justice the
originally<00:03:16.420> thirty-six<00:03:17.260> dollars<00:03:17.820> right<00:03:18.820> now

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
originally thirty-six dollars right now

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.060 
originally thirty-six dollars right now
I<00:03:19.060> know<00:03:19.330> they<00:03:19.660> are<00:03:20.080> having<00:03:20.260> a<00:03:20.440> store<00:03:20.709> Wed<00:03:20.860> sell

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
I know they are having a store Wed sell

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.960 
I know they are having a store Wed sell
50%<00:03:21.850> off<00:03:22.050> and<00:03:23.050> then<00:03:23.380> I<00:03:23.769> got<00:03:24.010> her<00:03:24.100> for<00:03:24.220> 40%<00:03:24.670> off
