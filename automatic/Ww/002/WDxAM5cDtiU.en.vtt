 I did not do video will ask me what? 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.219

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:16.049
 I just do not have to show in the 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.460
 last new year in tomou 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.949

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.189
 You guys will have a 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.170
 Sending I know but I always walk 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.269
 on Sunday in the morning and does 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.730
 three or four weekend rains falls 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.980
 So you can not walk 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.460
 It's not the time to stay where you were until 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.170
 people without shirt are very hot 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.620
 but even then the shopping mall 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.570
 Monday, today is a good day. 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.420
 then work a week ago we 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.940
 You can walk shocked so you 're not 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.930
 is helping us have already seen the video 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.789
 today, you already have the kind of 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.570
 is the fourth part of the traction project 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.129
 rear 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.120
 many people ask me about the 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.359
 design comment on the last piece already brother 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.430
 had another rate you get in morou much 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:07.950
 away will show up with the parts 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.350
 will use this fourth part of the project 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.540
 traction that is the 36-year already 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.070
 I wrote then I'll show the pieces 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:20.009
 that I have here hands and after doing all 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.409
 the installation of the parts there is easy another 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.860
 video dancing and running with 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.729
 changes I made to change for 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.400
 do 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.229
 still part of the effort of my 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.130
 research and therefore I invite the 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:38.130
 bring the 70 at a great angle here 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.439
 of 80 85 degrees says third 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.320
 So for that, some parts 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.399
 a thing to be able to play in the t3 that he 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.399
 had not seen this much 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:55.079
 So I have parts here in st. 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.590
 do not have dowels several types of 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.590
 size 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:07.640
 I have this one is from the direction of 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.959
 packaging of parts yet or what the 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.490
 agenda but this is part of the 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:16.459
 from the tozan group of the city that time I 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.770
 I want to make a change, call capeÃ­. 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.600
 I'll make a video later explaining that 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.540
 this head operation 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.830
 so I have here the top part of the 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.000
 in the right direction 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.950
 the mst how's the recipe completed all 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:39.830
 the necessary parts for this 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:44.840
 as it points there from the shaft nÃ© bearings to 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:46.940
 I already commented you tires of 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.620
 rubber that needed to be tested then 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.560
 I bought will also invest and I 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.290
 I enjoyed everything the same time the seller 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:59.540
 rubber grip mst 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:03.110
 apart from this there is great change is the 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.570
 suspension arms of a sound of a 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.720
 arm to make it easier to 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.340
 with the biggest hacker and then I said 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.640
 on here 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.799
 so had more others known as 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.590
 to make this arm work 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:22.700
 so this is personal is a piece of mine 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.510
 next change questioned the traction 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.450
 rear 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.940
 then the part of the direction everything there I 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:32.090
 I'm going to have all of my daughter's staff. 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.920
 I like that, I always had the will of the 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.400
 owner of three airports one video 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.640
 showing how the changes were 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.530
 possibly his test running 16 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.780
 improved or improved and 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.820
 succeeded in the next step of the 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:51.410
 operation bring beauty of the neighbor and 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.510
 Yes, I stayed a while without posting video 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.840
 but I've already spoken in other videos there 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.940
 I have nothing that predicted 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.200
 every Sunday every second once 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.200
 making the child as soon as I 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.640
 some have this information with all 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.890

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:10.520
 video I'll do it for you guys 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:13.010
 So today's driver stays around here. 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:17.570
