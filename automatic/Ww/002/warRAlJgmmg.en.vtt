back<00:00:09.540> with<00:00:09.900> my<00:00:10.080> magically<00:00:10.620> reduced<00:00:11.010> cane<00:00:11.370> it's

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
back with my magically reduced cane it's

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.810 
back with my magically reduced cane it's
triangular<00:00:12.510> cane<00:00:12.900> I<00:00:13.200> pulled<00:00:13.559> I<00:00:14.070> stretched<00:00:14.520> I

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
triangular cane I pulled I stretched I

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.630 
triangular cane I pulled I stretched I
used<00:00:15.150> my<00:00:15.360> brayer<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:16.110> I'm<00:00:16.920> down<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.189> the<00:00:17.369> size

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
used my brayer and I'm down to the size

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.570 
used my brayer and I'm down to the size
I<00:00:17.820> want<00:00:17.849> I'm<00:00:18.720> gonna<00:00:18.900> cut<00:00:19.140> it<00:00:19.259> in<00:00:19.410> six<00:00:19.860> equal

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
I want I'm gonna cut it in six equal

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:30.259 
I want I'm gonna cut it in six equal
parts<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:28.160> now<00:00:29.160> here<00:00:29.490> comes<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.820> fun<00:00:29.910> part

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
parts and now here comes the fun part

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.170 
parts and now here comes the fun part
when<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.380> look<00:00:31.619> at<00:00:31.830> them<00:00:32.010> you<00:00:33.000> want

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
when you look at them you want

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.390 
when you look at them you want
reassemble<00:00:34.080> them<00:00:34.199> as<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.350> mirror<00:00:34.650> image<00:00:34.769> by<00:00:35.370> the

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:35.400 
reassemble them as a mirror image by the

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.430 
reassemble them as a mirror image by the
way<00:00:35.580> it's<00:00:35.760> this<00:00:36.120> for<00:00:36.750> this<00:00:36.809> particular<00:00:36.989> thing

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
way it's this for this particular thing

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.459 
way it's this for this particular thing
it's<00:00:37.620> best<00:00:37.830> if<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.280> got<00:00:39.059> that<00:00:39.360> reduced<00:00:39.840> as

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
it's best if you got that reduced as

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.580 
it's best if you got that reduced as
equal<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.399> an<00:00:42.300> equilateral<00:00:42.660> triangle<00:00:43.170> as<00:00:43.469> you

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
equal of an equilateral triangle as you

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.990 
equal of an equilateral triangle as you
can<00:00:43.829> both<00:00:44.370> sides<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:45.210> same<00:00:45.420> length<00:00:46.489> that<00:00:47.489> way

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
can both sides the same length that way

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.799 
can both sides the same length that way
it's<00:00:48.210> just<00:00:48.270> easier<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.750> reassemble<00:00:49.879> but<00:00:50.879> we're

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
it's just easier to reassemble but we're

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.240 
it's just easier to reassemble but we're
gonna<00:00:51.930> reassemble<00:00:52.379> like<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.739> mirror<00:00:53.039> image

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
gonna reassemble like a mirror image

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.160 
gonna reassemble like a mirror image
like<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.980> you<00:00:55.980> have<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.190> do<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.340> little

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
like that you have to do a little

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.540 
like that you have to do a little
flipping<00:00:58.170> around<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.620> make<00:00:58.770> sure<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:59.100> have

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
flipping around to make sure you have

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.350 
flipping around to make sure you have
all<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.850> parts<00:01:00.090> right<00:01:01.340> but<00:01:02.340> there<00:01:03.059> are<00:01:03.180> so

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
all the parts right but there are so

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.299 
all the parts right but there are so
many<00:01:03.449> ways<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.899> do<00:01:04.020> it<00:01:04.050> if<00:01:04.410> you<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.800> mean<00:01:05.070> here's

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
many ways to do it if you I mean here's

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.359 
many ways to do it if you I mean here's
one<00:01:05.580> thing<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.360> it's<00:01:07.289> a<00:01:07.410> certain<00:01:07.590> pattern<00:01:07.920> but

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
one thing and it's a certain pattern but

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.630 
one thing and it's a certain pattern but
let's<00:01:08.550> look<00:01:08.729> take<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.300> other<00:01:09.450> half<00:01:09.720> and

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
let's look take the other half and

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.120 
let's look take the other half and
assemble<00:01:11.640> them<00:01:12.080> in<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.170> different<00:01:13.320> way<00:01:13.470> let's

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.160 

let's<00:01:17.130> do<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.580> way

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
let's do it that way

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.469 
let's do it that way
that<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.470> mirror<00:01:19.710> image<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.479> actually

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
that is the mirror image and actually

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.120 
that is the mirror image and actually
this<00:01:21.780> under<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.140> cane<00:01:22.320> obviously<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:22.860> not

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
this under the cane obviously is not

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.520 
this under the cane obviously is not
equal<00:01:24.409> but<00:01:25.409> anyway<00:01:26.720> you<00:01:27.720> know<00:01:27.750> if<00:01:27.869> we<00:01:27.990> just<00:01:28.200> do

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
equal but anyway you know if we just do

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.679 
equal but anyway you know if we just do
a<00:01:28.560> different<00:01:28.950> if<00:01:29.729> we<00:01:29.970> line<00:01:30.150> up<00:01:30.180> different

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
a different if we line up different

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.770 
a different if we line up different
edges<00:01:31.159> we<00:01:32.159> have<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.460> totally<00:01:33.030> different<00:01:33.360> look<00:01:33.479> I

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
edges we have a totally different look I

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.590 
edges we have a totally different look I
mean<00:01:34.020> this<00:01:34.229> one<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.710> center<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.159> black

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
mean this one the center is the black

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.890 
mean this one the center is the black
this<00:01:36.600> one<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.960> center<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:38.240> the<00:01:39.240> jelly<00:01:39.630> where

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
this one the center is the jelly where

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.020 
this one the center is the jelly where
the<00:01:41.240> bullseye<00:01:42.240> came<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:44.220> have<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.700> decide

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
the bullseye came so you have to decide

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.660 
the bullseye came so you have to decide
how<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.479> want<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.900> reassemble<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.560> one<00:01:47.400> way<00:01:47.610> to

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
how you want to reassemble it one way to

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.310 
how you want to reassemble it one way to
do<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.299> is<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:48.750> can<00:01:48.900> actually<00:01:49.049> like

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
do that is you can actually like

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.499 
do that is you can actually like
assemble<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.799> like<00:01:49.950> this<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.490> put<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.149> down<00:01:51.329> on

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
assemble it like this and put it down on

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.179 
assemble it like this and put it down on
a<00:01:51.540> mirror<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.079> it'll<00:01:52.500> reflect<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.070> you'll

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
a mirror and it'll reflect and you'll

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.859 
a mirror and it'll reflect and you'll
see<00:01:53.430> what<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.790> whole<00:01:54.000> cane<00:01:54.270> will<00:01:54.450> look<00:01:54.659> like

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
see what the whole cane will look like

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.310 
see what the whole cane will look like
when<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.470> assemble<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.220> way<00:01:56.600> but<00:01:57.600> just

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
when you assemble it that way but just

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.280 
when you assemble it that way but just
have<00:01:58.500> fun<00:01:58.740> flipping<00:01:59.310> the<00:02:00.030> different<00:02:00.360> edges

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
have fun flipping the different edges

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.260 
have fun flipping the different edges
together<00:02:01.470> and<00:02:01.979> I'll<00:02:02.159> flip<00:02:02.340> these<00:02:02.520> around<00:02:02.579> this

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
together and I'll flip these around this

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.149 
together and I'll flip these around this
has<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.659> bullseye<00:02:04.380> in<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.590> middle<00:02:04.799> let's<00:02:04.950> do

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
has the bullseye in the middle let's do

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.490 
has the bullseye in the middle let's do
it<00:02:05.280> so<00:02:05.430> we<00:02:05.549> have<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:06.020> jelly<00:02:07.020> roll<00:02:07.259> in<00:02:07.409> the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
it so we have the jelly roll in the

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.430 
it so we have the jelly roll in the
middle<00:02:08.360> and<00:02:09.360> again<00:02:09.540> it's<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:09.959> totally

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
middle and again it's a totally

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.110 
middle and again it's a totally
different<00:02:10.769> look<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:11.519> the<00:02:11.610> cane

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
different look to the cane

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.559 
different look to the cane
so<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.410> decision<00:02:13.950> is<00:02:14.190> yours<00:02:14.459> I<00:02:14.970> kind<00:02:15.299> of<00:02:15.329> liked

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
so the decision is yours I kind of liked

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.130 
so the decision is yours I kind of liked
it<00:02:15.720> with<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.989> black

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
it with the black

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.960 
it with the black
in<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.710> middle<00:02:17.980> there<00:02:18.160> so<00:02:18.190> I'm<00:02:18.460> gonna<00:02:18.640> go

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
in the middle there so I'm gonna go

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:28.520 
in the middle there so I'm gonna go
ahead<00:02:19.000> and<00:02:19.390> assemble<00:02:19.960> it<00:02:20.050> that<00:02:20.290> way

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.800 

oops<00:02:29.530> no<00:02:30.220> Sam's<00:02:30.670> gonna<00:02:30.910> I<00:02:31.180> was<00:02:31.360> just<00:02:31.540> looking

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
oops no Sam's gonna I was just looking

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.240 
oops no Sam's gonna I was just looking
at<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:32.020> black<00:02:32.230> mention<00:02:32.770> the<00:02:32.830> black<00:02:32.950> but

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
at the black mention the black but

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.730 
at the black mention the black but
obviously<00:02:33.790> I<00:02:33.880> have<00:02:34.150> to<00:02:34.330> slip<00:02:34.660> it<00:02:36.090> I<00:02:37.440> need<00:02:38.440> to<00:02:38.470> do

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
obviously I have to slip it I need to do

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.990 
obviously I have to slip it I need to do
too<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:40.860> hopefully<00:02:41.860> if<00:02:42.010> all<00:02:42.190> went<00:02:42.400> well<00:02:42.490> it

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
too and hopefully if all went well it

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.550 
too and hopefully if all went well it
was<00:02:43.120> usually<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.570> last<00:02:43.959> piece<00:02:44.200> should<00:02:44.380> fall

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
was usually the last piece should fall

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.100 
was usually the last piece should fall
into<00:02:44.860> place<00:02:44.980> on<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.340> L<00:02:45.580> should<00:02:45.870> fit<00:02:46.870> nicely

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
into place on the L should fit nicely

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.820 
into place on the L should fit nicely
together<00:02:47.880> so<00:02:48.880> there<00:02:49.450> is<00:02:49.750> your<00:02:50.200> collects

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
together so there is your collects

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.550 
together so there is your collects
cocaine<00:02:51.160> as<00:02:51.400> always<00:02:51.850> when<00:02:52.060> you're<00:02:52.180> assembling

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
cocaine as always when you're assembling

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.750 
cocaine as always when you're assembling
flip<00:02:53.560> it<00:02:53.709> over<00:02:53.830> and<00:02:54.010> make<00:02:54.160> sure<00:02:54.459> you<00:02:54.580> have

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
flip it over and make sure you have

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.650 
flip it over and make sure you have
actually<00:02:55.300> wind<00:02:55.720> up<00:02:55.989> this<00:02:56.380> edge<00:02:56.650> too<00:02:57.660> because

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
actually wind up this edge too because

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:06.350 
actually wind up this edge too because
it's<00:02:59.400> just<00:03:00.400> as<00:03:00.550> important<00:03:04.530> all<00:03:05.530> sides

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
it's just as important all sides

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.520 
it's just as important all sides
hopefully<00:03:07.360> doesn't<00:03:07.720> always<00:03:07.930> work<00:03:08.170> this<00:03:08.350> way

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
hopefully doesn't always work this way

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.740 
hopefully doesn't always work this way
but<00:03:08.560> hopefully<00:03:08.830> if<00:03:09.160> both<00:03:09.340> ends<00:03:09.640> are<00:03:09.940> lined<00:03:10.510> up

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
but hopefully if both ends are lined up

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.780 
but hopefully if both ends are lined up
that<00:03:11.680> means<00:03:11.950> it's<00:03:12.130> lined<00:03:12.370> up<00:03:12.489> all<00:03:12.610> the<00:03:12.640> way

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
that means it's lined up all the way

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.690 
that means it's lined up all the way
through<00:03:13.060> the<00:03:13.180> minute<00:03:13.420> -<00:03:13.830> so<00:03:14.830> there<00:03:15.340> you<00:03:15.370> go

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
through the minute - so there you go

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.949 
through the minute - so there you go
there's<00:03:16.209> your<00:03:16.300> -<00:03:16.630> assembly<00:03:17.440> like<00:03:18.010> that<00:03:18.959> you

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
there's your - assembly like that you

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.220 
there's your - assembly like that you
can<00:03:20.580> wrap<00:03:21.580> this<00:03:21.910> with<00:03:22.330> a<00:03:22.390> color<00:03:22.690> if<00:03:22.870> you<00:03:23.019> want

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
can wrap this with a color if you want

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.620 
can wrap this with a color if you want
you<00:03:23.739> can<00:03:23.890> leave<00:03:24.070> it<00:03:24.250> as<00:03:24.400> is<00:03:24.640> it<00:03:25.150> doesn't<00:03:25.510> really

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
you can leave it as is it doesn't really

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.770 
you can leave it as is it doesn't really
matter<00:03:25.900> and<00:03:26.830> you<00:03:27.670> would<00:03:27.820> reduce<00:03:28.180> it<00:03:28.450> again

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
matter and you would reduce it again

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.350 
matter and you would reduce it again
it's<00:03:28.959> a<00:03:29.080> funny<00:03:29.350> shaped<00:03:29.680> cane<00:03:29.980> so<00:03:30.340> you<00:03:30.400> now<00:03:31.299> you

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
it's a funny shaped cane so you now you

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.970 
it's a funny shaped cane so you now you
know<00:03:31.600> actually<00:03:32.049> that<00:03:32.080> we<00:03:32.290> assembled<00:03:32.680> this<00:03:32.769> as

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
know actually that we assembled this as

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.039 
know actually that we assembled this as
in<00:03:33.220> triangles<00:03:33.730> if<00:03:33.910> you<00:03:34.120> wanted<00:03:34.390> to<00:03:34.570> you<00:03:34.900> could

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
in triangles if you wanted to you could

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.110 
in triangles if you wanted to you could
now<00:03:35.260> just<00:03:35.500> round<00:03:35.739> this<00:03:35.920> out<00:03:36.100> and<00:03:36.459> it<00:03:37.000> would

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
now just round this out and it would

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.390 
now just round this out and it would
still<00:03:37.480> have<00:03:37.720> the<00:03:38.320> mirror<00:03:38.739> effect<00:03:39.130> the

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
still have the mirror effect the

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.750 
still have the mirror effect the
kaleidoscope<00:03:39.970> effect<00:03:40.110> or<00:03:41.110> you<00:03:41.380> can<00:03:41.620> reduce<00:03:42.489> it

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
kaleidoscope effect or you can reduce it

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.789 
kaleidoscope effect or you can reduce it
in<00:03:43.320> the<00:03:44.549> six-sided<00:03:45.549> form<00:03:46.180> to<00:03:47.019> do<00:03:47.200> that<00:03:47.410> again

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
in the six-sided form to do that again

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:49.710 
in the six-sided form to do that again
what<00:03:48.280> you<00:03:48.430> know<00:03:48.549> anytime<00:03:48.850> you<00:03:49.030> reduce<00:03:49.390> you<00:03:49.570> can

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
what you know anytime you reduce you can

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.990 
what you know anytime you reduce you can
gonna<00:03:49.840> start<00:03:50.170> pushing<00:03:50.590> from<00:03:50.920> the<00:03:51.100> middle<00:03:51.400> you

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
gonna start pushing from the middle you

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.009 
gonna start pushing from the middle you
don't<00:03:52.030> want<00:03:52.360> to<00:03:52.420> start<00:03:52.600> at<00:03:52.720> the<00:03:52.810> end<00:03:52.959> just

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
don't want to start at the end just

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.810 
don't want to start at the end just
necessarily<00:03:54.010> push<00:03:54.670> from<00:03:54.880> the<00:03:55.000> middle<00:03:55.299> and

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
necessarily push from the middle and

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:04.550 
necessarily push from the middle and
keep<00:03:57.820> on<00:03:58.030> going<00:03:58.480> and<00:03:59.260> use<00:03:59.410> your<00:03:59.680> brayer<00:04:01.769> pull

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
keep on going and use your brayer pull

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.830 
keep on going and use your brayer pull
anything<00:04:05.560> to<00:04:05.769> get<00:04:05.950> all<00:04:06.100> those<00:04:06.310> pieces

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
anything to get all those pieces

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.930 
anything to get all those pieces
compressed<00:04:07.840> together<00:04:08.170> and<00:04:08.769> then<00:04:09.959> lengthened

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
compressed together and then lengthened

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.250 
compressed together and then lengthened
you<00:04:12.940> know<00:04:13.060> it<00:04:13.180> will<00:04:13.299> distort<00:04:13.690> a<00:04:13.810> little<00:04:14.049> bit

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
you know it will distort a little bit

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.620 
you know it will distort a little bit
but<00:04:14.680> when<00:04:14.829> you're<00:04:15.010> down<00:04:15.220> to<00:04:15.430> your<00:04:15.459> final<00:04:15.790> size

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
but when you're down to your final size

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.750 
but when you're down to your final size
that<00:04:16.930> you<00:04:17.019> want<00:04:17.169> it<00:04:17.350> you<00:04:17.620> can<00:04:17.769> always<00:04:17.950> redefine

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
that you want it you can always redefine

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.850 
that you want it you can always redefine
your<00:04:19.299> sizes<00:04:19.930> your<00:04:20.229> side's<00:04:21.030> yeah

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
your sizes your side's yeah

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.899 
your sizes your side's yeah
and<00:04:23.849> if<00:04:24.060> you<00:04:24.180> want<00:04:24.389> to<00:04:24.509> decide<00:04:25.500> it<00:04:25.650> later<00:04:25.860> on<00:04:25.979> it

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:26.909 
and if you want to decide it later on it

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:29.629 
and if you want to decide it later on it
could<00:04:27.210> reduce<00:04:27.870> part<00:04:28.439> of<00:04:28.560> one<00:04:28.919> end<00:04:29.129> of<00:04:29.250> it<00:04:29.400> to

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
could reduce part of one end of it to

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.820 
could reduce part of one end of it to
one<00:04:29.970> size<00:04:30.270> you<00:04:30.930> can<00:04:31.080> wrap<00:04:31.319> the<00:04:31.530> other<00:04:31.560> side

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
one size you can wrap the other side

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.129 
one size you can wrap the other side
with<00:04:32.280> a<00:04:32.400> binding<00:04:33.389> color<00:04:33.629> if<00:04:33.810> you<00:04:33.930> want

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
with a binding color if you want

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.529 
with a binding color if you want
whatever<00:04:34.620> you<00:04:34.740> want<00:04:34.919> very<00:04:35.250> versatile<00:04:35.759> but

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:36.539 
whatever you want very versatile but

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:38.659 
whatever you want very versatile but
this<00:04:37.020> will<00:04:37.199> reduce<00:04:37.379> down<00:04:37.860> to<00:04:38.159> all<00:04:38.490> different

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
this will reduce down to all different

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:42.580 
this will reduce down to all different
sizes<00:04:39.270> just<00:04:39.479> like<00:04:39.990> any<00:04:40.199> other<00:04:40.319> game<00:04:40.560> and

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
sizes just like any other game and

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.729 
sizes just like any other game and
there's<00:04:43.590> your<00:04:43.830> kaleidoscope<00:04:44.159> cake
