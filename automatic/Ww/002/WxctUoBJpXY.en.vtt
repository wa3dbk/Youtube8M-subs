00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.020
 wanted to record live monitor with 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.609
 fraps that they just just stop 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.980
 see black picture that lies namely 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.600
 that has just a few things 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.550
 have to be adjusted and in 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.930
 tutorials weather lino said you have to 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.849

 That's just what it's going to be like 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.260
 could someday choose but could 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.600
 so do you want design and 407 design 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.360
 Just make a handsome here 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.479
