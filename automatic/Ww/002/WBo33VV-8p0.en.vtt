00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
to hear but it sounds brandon has a very

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.280 
to hear but it sounds brandon has a very
distinct<00:01:21.090> voice<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.540> sounds<00:01:21.900> almost<00:01:22.049> like

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
distinct voice and it sounds almost like

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.929 
distinct voice and it sounds almost like
he's<00:01:22.590> swimming<00:01:22.860> underwater<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.580> sounds<00:01:23.850> like

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
he's swimming underwater it sounds like

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.490 
he's swimming underwater it sounds like
the<00:01:24.060> speakers<00:01:24.420> on<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.630> verge<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.930> blowing<00:01:25.170> and

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
the speakers on the verge of blowing and

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.050 
the speakers on the verge of blowing and
it's<00:01:25.979> not<00:01:26.130> turned<00:01:26.369> up<00:01:26.490> all<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.759> way<00:01:26.880> either

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
it's not turned up all the way either

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.249 
it's not turned up all the way either
when<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.330> turn<00:01:27.479> up<00:01:27.600> all<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.810> way<00:01:27.900> obviously

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
when you turn up all the way obviously

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.200 
when you turn up all the way obviously
it<00:01:28.470> gets<00:01:28.619> worse<00:01:28.799> as<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.100> gain<00:01:29.430> increases<00:01:29.820> so

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
it gets worse as the gain increases so

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.749 
it gets worse as the gain increases so
that's<00:01:31.020> something<00:01:31.229> Adele<00:01:31.619> really<00:01:32.130> really<00:01:32.520> I

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
that's something Adele really really I

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.850 
that's something Adele really really I
mean<00:01:33.750> again<00:01:34.079> this<00:01:34.259> could<00:01:34.470> just<00:01:34.590> be<00:01:34.680> this

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
mean again this could just be this

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.499 
mean again this could just be this
device<00:01:35.159> here<00:01:35.400> but<00:01:35.549> if<00:01:35.640> it's<00:01:35.820> not<00:01:35.880> if<00:01:36.180> it's<00:01:36.270> with

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509

efficient because of that another
application<00:03:18.310> that<00:03:18.549> has<00:03:18.639> actually<00:03:19.090> gained<00:03:19.329> a

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
application that has actually gained a

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.449 
application that has actually gained a
lot<00:03:19.750> of<00:03:19.870> attention<00:03:20.319> lately<00:03:20.349> is<00:03:20.769> the<00:03:20.950> facebook

actually<00:03:31.060> rework<00:03:31.889> house<00:03:32.889> is<00:03:33.099> going<00:03:33.250> to<00:03:33.340> work

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
actually rework house is going to work

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.509 
actually rework house is going to work
on<00:03:33.700> some<00:03:33.910> devices<00:03:34.060> because<00:03:34.840> we<00:03:35.560> do<00:03:35.709> not<00:03:35.739> have<00:03:36.190> a

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
on some devices because we do not have a

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.069 
on some devices because we do not have a
landscape<00:03:37.060> mode<00:03:37.299> and<00:03:37.329> we<00:03:37.540> will<00:03:37.660> actually<00:03:37.810> hold

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
landscape mode and we will actually hold

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.930 
landscape mode and we will actually hold
the<00:03:38.230> device<00:03:38.349> up<00:03:38.620> here<00:03:38.829> even<00:03:39.069> shake<00:03:39.310> it<00:03:39.489> it

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
the device up here even shake it it

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.550 
the device up here even shake it it
won't<00:03:40.209> go<00:03:40.329> into<00:03:40.510> landscape<00:03:40.930> mode<00:03:41.079> at<00:03:41.200> all<00:03:41.319> so

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
won't go into landscape mode at all so

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.530 
won't go into landscape mode at all so
we're<00:03:41.680> stuck<00:03:42.010> with<00:03:42.069> the<00:03:42.370> vertical<00:03:42.609> which

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
we're stuck with the vertical which

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.089 
we're stuck with the vertical which
looks<00:03:43.840> identical<00:03:44.470> to<00:03:44.500> what<00:03:44.709> you're<00:03:44.799> going<00:03:44.980> to

Wildfire review that we recently did and
it<00:04:27.430> loads<00:04:27.730> fairly<00:04:28.720> quickly<00:04:28.990> but<00:04:29.550> it<00:04:30.550> also

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
it loads fairly quickly but it also

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.380 
it loads fairly quickly but it also
loads<00:04:32.190> the<00:04:33.190> pages<00:04:33.520> of<00:04:33.550> holes<00:04:33.850> you<00:04:34.030> can<00:04:34.060> see

issue that makes the browsing experience
much<00:05:00.580> easier<00:05:00.970> you<00:05:01.540> do<00:05:01.690> have<00:05:01.780> the<00:05:01.840> multi-touch

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
much easier you do have the multi-touch

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.840 
much easier you do have the multi-touch

changing<00:05:09.850> in<00:05:09.940> the<00:05:09.970> size<00:05:10.210> so<00:05:10.420> you'll<00:05:10.540> get<00:05:10.630> a

changing in the size so you'll get a

fully renders you can also use the

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.390 
now it's time for a gaming test we have

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.150 
now it's time for a gaming test we have
raging<00:05:31.810> thunder<00:05:32.290> loaded<00:05:32.620> on<00:05:32.740> both<00:05:32.950> devices

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
raging thunder loaded on both devices

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.540 
raging thunder loaded on both devices
here<00:05:33.640> which<00:05:33.790> are<00:05:33.940> the<00:05:34.030> HTC<00:05:34.750> evo<00:05:35.080> 4g<00:05:35.110> and<00:05:35.860> of

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
here which are the HTC evo 4g and of

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.490 
here which are the HTC evo 4g and of
course<00:05:36.580> the<00:05:36.910> dell<00:05:37.120> streak<00:05:37.360> so<00:05:38.320> we're<00:05:38.410> actually

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
course the dell streak so we're actually

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.720 
course the dell streak so we're actually
going<00:05:38.710> to<00:05:38.800> go<00:05:38.860> ahead<00:05:38.950> and<00:05:39.130> start<00:05:39.280> a<00:05:39.340> race<00:05:39.520> on

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:39.730 
going to go ahead and start a race on

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:41.190 
going to go ahead and start a race on
both<00:05:39.940> these<00:05:40.060> devices<00:05:40.360> at<00:05:40.600> the<00:05:40.630> same<00:05:40.690> exact

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.200 
both these devices at the same exact

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.750 
both these devices at the same exact
time<00:05:41.380> and<00:05:41.680> we'll<00:05:42.100> see<00:05:42.250> which<00:05:42.370> one<00:05:42.520> performs

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:42.760 
time and we'll see which one performs

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.550 
time and we'll see which one performs
better<00:05:43.060> in<00:05:43.180> terms<00:05:43.510> of<00:05:43.690> frame<00:05:43.990> rate<00:05:44.230> whatever

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
better in terms of frame rate whatever

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.280 
better in terms of frame rate whatever
it<00:05:44.770> may<00:05:44.890> be<00:05:44.920> or<00:05:45.280> if<00:05:45.730> they<00:05:45.910> perform<00:05:46.240> the<00:05:46.330> same<00:05:46.510> or

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:47.290 
it may be or if they perform the same or

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.570 
it may be or if they perform the same or
else<00:05:47.470> of<00:05:47.590> that<00:05:47.680> you<00:05:47.860> can<00:05:47.980> actually<00:05:48.130> see<00:05:48.310> if<00:05:48.460> the

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
else of that you can actually see if the

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.090 
else of that you can actually see if the
menu<00:05:48.850> here<00:05:49.090> is<00:05:49.270> much<00:05:49.810> easier<00:05:49.870> to<00:05:50.440> read<00:05:50.680> because

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.100 
menu here is much easier to read because

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.280 
menu here is much easier to read because
it<00:05:51.190> is<00:05:51.310> actually<00:05:51.790> much<00:05:52.090> more<00:05:52.330> clear<00:05:52.780> and<00:05:52.960> much

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:53.290 
it is actually much more clear and much

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.950 
it is actually much more clear and much
wider<00:05:53.590> to<00:05:54.220> the<00:05:54.540> resolution<00:05:55.540> of<00:05:55.630> the<00:05:55.690> device

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
wider to the resolution of the device

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.290 
wider to the resolution of the device
one<00:05:56.680> side<00:05:56.950> note<00:05:57.220> we<00:05:57.400> typically<00:05:57.760> test<00:05:58.090> with

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
one side note we typically test with

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.110 
one side note we typically test with
asphalt<00:05:58.770> however<00:05:59.770> the<00:06:00.340> asphalt<00:06:00.730> racing<00:06:01.060> is

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
asphalt however the asphalt racing is

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.240 
asphalt however the asphalt racing is

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:05.140 
of course the dell streak only has one

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.510 
of course the dell streak only has one
point<00:06:05.380> six<00:06:05.590> so<00:06:05.800> we<00:06:05.890> had<00:06:06.010> to<00:06:06.100> use<00:06:06.130> raging

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 
point six so we had to use raging

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.770 
point six so we had to use raging
thunder<00:06:06.820> now<00:06:07.060> these<00:06:07.150> are<00:06:07.300> both<00:06:07.390> running<00:06:07.570> at

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:07.780 
thunder now these are both running at

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.150 
thunder now these are both running at
the<00:06:07.870> same<00:06:08.050> exact<00:06:08.380> time<00:06:08.560> going<00:06:08.770> to<00:06:08.860> zoom<00:06:09.040> in

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:09.160 
the same exact time going to zoom in

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.710 
the same exact time going to zoom in
here<00:06:09.190> just<00:06:09.520> a<00:06:09.670> little<00:06:09.700> quickly<00:06:10.420> so<00:06:10.510> you<00:06:10.570> can

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 
here just a little quickly so you can

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.770 
here just a little quickly so you can
actually<00:06:10.900> see<00:06:11.790> it<00:06:12.790> almost<00:06:13.060> looks<00:06:13.390> as<00:06:13.510> though

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:13.780 
actually see it almost looks as though

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.110 
actually see it almost looks as though
the<00:06:14.560> colors<00:06:15.010> are<00:06:15.190> a<00:06:15.220> little<00:06:15.280> clearer<00:06:15.790> on<00:06:15.940> the

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
the colors are a little clearer on the

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:22.680 
the colors are a little clearer on the
dell<00:06:16.360> streak<00:06:18.780> as<00:06:19.830> far<00:06:20.830> as<00:06:21.010> the<00:06:21.310> detail<00:06:21.820> goes<00:06:22.120> it

dell streak as far as the detail goes it

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.390 
dell streak as far as the detail goes it
also<00:06:23.140> looks<00:06:23.290> like<00:06:23.350> the<00:06:23.530> detail<00:06:23.890> on<00:06:23.920> the<00:06:24.130> streak

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 
also looks like the detail on the streak

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.610 
also looks like the detail on the streak
may<00:06:24.550> be<00:06:24.610> a<00:06:24.760> little<00:06:25.120> bit<00:06:25.330> clearer<00:06:25.720> on<00:06:25.900> the<00:06:26.410> car

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:26.620 
may be a little bit clearer on the car

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.510 
may be a little bit clearer on the car
itself<00:06:26.950> you<00:06:27.700> can<00:06:27.820> see<00:06:27.940> some<00:06:27.970> of<00:06:28.150> the<00:06:28.270> fender

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 
itself you can see some of the fender

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.980 
itself you can see some of the fender
accents<00:06:30.520> a<00:06:30.610> little<00:06:30.940> bit<00:06:31.030> clearer<00:06:31.330> but<00:06:31.810> that

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:31.990 
accents a little bit clearer but that

you're really not going to see a

overall<00:06:54.490> the<00:06:54.669> experience<00:06:54.699> on<00:06:55.240> the<00:06:55.330> streak<00:06:55.630> may

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:55.840 
overall the experience on the streak may

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.540 
overall the experience on the streak may
be<00:06:55.900> a<00:06:56.020> little<00:06:56.169> better<00:06:56.440> for<00:06:56.650> gaming<00:06:56.800> that's

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:57.550 
be a little better for gaming that's

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.309 
be a little better for gaming that's
because<00:06:57.789> the<00:06:57.910> screen<00:06:58.150> is<00:06:58.210> bigger<00:06:58.449> it's<00:06:59.110> very

00:06:59.309 --> 00:06:59.319 
because the screen is bigger it's very

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:02.100 
because the screen is bigger it's very
close<00:06:59.620> to<00:06:59.860> the<00:07:00.009> dsi<00:07:00.580> XL<00:07:00.720> so<00:07:01.720> this<00:07:01.840> is<00:07:01.990> actually

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:02.110 
close to the dsi XL so this is actually

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:04.110 
close to the dsi XL so this is actually
