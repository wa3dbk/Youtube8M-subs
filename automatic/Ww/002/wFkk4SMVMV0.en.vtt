00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.059 
i'm not sure if the buildings are
different<00:01:37.050> or<00:01:37.140> whatever<00:01:37.440> nothing<00:01:37.800> in<00:01:37.890> there

00:01:38.059 --> 00:01:38.069 
different or whatever nothing in there

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:40.669

some<00:01:38.789> lava<00:01:39.000> here<00:01:39.569> I<00:01:39.720> think<00:01:40.170> it's<00:01:40.289> only<00:01:40.380> one

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
some lava here I think it's only one

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:42.680 
some lava here I think it's only one
thing<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.039> lava<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.670> nice<00:01:42.179> little<00:01:42.390> fountain

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690

I'll<00:01:43.110> go<00:01:43.349> in<00:01:43.530> but<00:01:43.800> it's<00:01:44.369> really<00:01:44.610> annoying<00:01:44.910> to

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
I'll go in but it's really annoying to

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.210 
I'll go in but it's really annoying to
get<00:01:45.119> out<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.450> just<00:01:46.229> because<00:01:46.470> they<00:01:46.860> made<00:01:47.099> it

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
get out of it just because they made it

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.760 
get out of it just because they made it
slower<00:01:47.550> to<00:01:47.849> go<00:01:48.030> up<00:01:48.149> water<00:01:48.390> now<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.869> there's<00:01:49.679> a

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
slower to go up water now and there's a

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.830 
slower to go up water now and there's a
farm<00:01:50.130> near<00:01:50.459> to<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:50.910> you're<00:01:51.270> Hannah<00:01:51.450> drains

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
think there's anything in these chests

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.290 
think there's anything in these chests
well<00:02:04.410> there<00:02:04.560> isn't<00:02:04.739> and<00:02:05.489> once<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:05.759> go<00:02:05.910> up<00:02:06.090> oh

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.330 
well there isn't and once you go up oh
another<00:02:06.630> one<00:02:06.840> in<00:02:06.989> the<00:02:07.110> corner<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.410> missed<00:02:07.679> and

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
another one in the corner I missed and

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.999 
another one in the corner I missed and
once<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:08.580> go<00:02:08.729> up<00:02:08.910> there<00:02:09.179> is<00:02:09.530> two<00:02:10.530> beds<00:02:10.800> just

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
once you go up there is two beds just

laying there
and<00:02:12.370> yeah<00:02:12.700> this<00:02:12.880> is<00:02:12.940> I<00:02:13.120> guess<00:02:13.300> where<00:02:13.540> you<00:02:13.690> would

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
and yeah this is I guess where you would

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.310 
and yeah this is I guess where you would
go<00:02:14.440> and<00:02:15.040> sleep<00:02:15.430> and<00:02:15.670> stuff<00:02:15.880> like<00:02:16.000> that<00:02:16.060> oh<00:02:16.420> yes

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
go and sleep and stuff like that oh yes

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.870 
go and sleep and stuff like that oh yes
I<00:02:17.590> think<00:02:17.650> this<00:02:17.920> is<00:02:18.040> a<00:02:18.070> really<00:02:18.370> cool<00:02:18.610> mod

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
I think this is a really cool mod

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.730 
I think this is a really cool mod
actually<00:02:19.300> I<00:02:19.330> really<00:02:19.630> like<00:02:19.780> it<00:02:19.960> it's<00:02:20.380> modloader

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
actually I really like it it's modloader

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:26.610 
actually I really like it it's modloader
compatible<00:02:21.990> for<00:02:22.990> 1.4<00:02:23.680> 01<00:02:25.200> nuts<00:02:26.200> think<00:02:26.470> is

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
compatible for 1.4 01 nuts think is

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.500 
compatible for 1.4 01 nuts think is
there<00:02:26.740> anything<00:02:26.920> else<00:02:27.160> here<00:02:27.430> I<00:02:27.580> think<00:02:28.360> that's

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
there anything else here I think that's

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.560 
there anything else here I think that's
pretty<00:02:28.750> much<00:02:28.960> it<00:02:29.460> yeah<00:02:30.460> it<00:02:30.520> creates<00:02:30.820> it's<00:02:31.450> not

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
pretty much it yeah it creates it's not

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.570 
pretty much it yeah it creates it's not
