00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.340
 and this is so 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:51.780
 as extinct friends youtubers 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.780
 good i decide 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.650
 just a moment 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.340
 but I think we're in a new 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.320
 video in which I will explain a 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.760
 little how is my computer and here the 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.860
 pooch that sneaks through the plane 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.600
 but well no matter what I'm going to say 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.120
 a little bit above what has my new 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.190
 pc and step because I'll leave you in the 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.030
 inscription the most detailed things the 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:28.780
 processor it is an intel core i7 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:32.350
 47 70 k of 3.5 gigahertz and the graph 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.420
 it is nothing but a geforce gtx 770 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.479
 so let's see we have a little more 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.550
 inside this cucumber because the truth 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.470
 is that it is a real beast and we see 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.660
 cooling microprocessor 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.240
 it is nothing other than a double fan 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:49.390
 with liquid cooling there we see the 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.100
 rest of fans running at all 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.740
 rag what is certain is that this box has 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.310
 very good the flow we have the motherboard 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:00.860
 an x 87 gigabytes if I'm not wrong 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.920
 and the ram memory that are 16 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.630
 witnesses gigas of rom memory that I have 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.440
 while the power supply 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:12.920
 it's a rm 750 gold thing and the hard drive 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.860
 it's one terabyte and 256 gigabytes 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.020
 additional in ssd and we passed the 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.820
 peripherals besides the micro this with the 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.030
 I'm commenting now I've caught 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.740
 a good 24-inch screen 140 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.930
 megahertz so that the 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.170
 view and as for the keyboard and the mouse 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:33.500
 the mouse is a logitech 500 s with the 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.090
 Adjustable weight to each one's taste and 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.010
 control country which is very 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.830
 interesting and the keyboard is a alvia 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.810
 omnium backlit and mechanical with the 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.420
 cherry red that also comes to play 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.120
 to any of the games that now 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.580
 same I'm playing finally thank 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.870
 and to the more than 5000 kingdom brothers that 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.760
 we are the truth is that I did not expect 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.280
 nothing to get to this figure in less 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.530
 of a year so I'm going really well 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.310
 I do not believe it, the truth is that 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.530
 it's a very emotional moment and I hope that 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.110
 that we can continue sharing so much 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.410
 moments like our videos like some 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.209
 that another direct later and that as 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.870
 I always tell you, I hope you do me 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:17.950
 case and you already know how to be good and be good 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.950
 see you later
