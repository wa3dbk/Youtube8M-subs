of<00:01:56.399> like<00:01:56.579> I'm<00:01:57.229> really<00:01:58.229> upset<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.950> point

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
of like I'm really upset to the point

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.980 
of like I'm really upset to the point
because<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.490> don't<00:01:59.640> understand<00:02:00.180> what<00:02:00.420> we<00:02:00.750> did

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
because I don't understand what we did

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.310 
because I don't understand what we did
wrong<00:02:01.939> the<00:02:02.939> only<00:02:03.000> thing<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.479> can<00:02:03.659> think<00:02:03.689> of<00:02:04.049> that

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
wrong the only thing I can think of that

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.260 
wrong the only thing I can think of that
would<00:02:04.469> make<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:04.890> like<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.280> would<00:02:05.369> think<00:02:05.939> of<00:02:06.090> why

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
would make it like I would think of why

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.990 
would make it like I would think of why
they<00:02:06.479> would<00:02:06.630> resent<00:02:07.049> me<00:02:07.229> was<00:02:07.439> because<00:02:08.000> there's

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
they would resent me was because there's

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.830 
they would resent me was because there's
just<00:02:09.209> one<00:02:09.390> mission<00:02:09.979> that<00:02:10.979> we<00:02:11.489> were

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
just one mission that we were

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.930 
just one mission that we were
me<00:02:12.170> and<00:02:12.290> Zahra<00:02:12.530> we're<00:02:12.890> doing<00:02:13.370> over<00:02:13.700> and<00:02:13.819> over

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
me and Zahra we're doing over and over

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.110 
me and Zahra we're doing over and over
again<00:02:14.209> and<00:02:15.130> it's<00:02:16.130> it's<00:02:16.400> one<00:02:16.580> of<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.730> missions

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
again and it's it's one of the missions

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.680 
again and it's it's one of the missions
from<00:02:17.270> Gerald<00:02:17.810> and<00:02:18.080> you<00:02:19.040> know<00:02:19.330> pretty<00:02:20.330> much<00:02:20.420> it

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
from Gerald and you know pretty much it

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.900 
from Gerald and you know pretty much it
takes<00:02:20.810> about<00:02:21.020> two<00:02:21.349> minutes<00:02:21.380> to<00:02:21.860> do<00:02:22.040> it<00:02:22.220> and<00:02:22.400> you

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
takes about two minutes to do it and you

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.699 
takes about two minutes to do it and you
get<00:02:23.060> about<00:02:23.180> nine<00:02:23.540> thousand<00:02:24.050> dollars<00:02:24.170> so<00:02:24.560> we

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
get about nine thousand dollars so we

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.410 
get about nine thousand dollars so we
were<00:02:24.800> doing<00:02:25.069> it<00:02:25.190> over<00:02:25.370> and<00:02:25.819> over<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:26.330> over

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
were doing it over and over and over

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.890 
were doing it over and over and over
again<00:02:26.660> so<00:02:27.410> um<00:02:27.819> now<00:02:28.819> if<00:02:29.150> you<00:02:29.360> want<00:02:29.510> to<00:02:29.599> consider

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
again so um now if you want to consider

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.750 
again so um now if you want to consider
that<00:02:30.080> boosting<00:02:30.709> whatever<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.069> hell<00:02:31.220> I<00:02:31.459> I

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
that boosting whatever the hell I I

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.790 
that boosting whatever the hell I I
guess<00:02:32.180> I<00:02:32.480> mean<00:02:32.690> I<00:02:32.720> don't<00:02:32.900> I<00:02:33.200> don't<00:02:33.440> see<00:02:33.590> how

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
guess I mean I don't I don't see how

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.690 
guess I mean I don't I don't see how

can<00:03:17.299> think<00:03:17.329> of<00:03:17.660> that<00:03:18.620> would<00:03:18.799> make<00:03:19.010> it<00:03:19.160> to<00:03:19.280> where

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
can think of that would make it to where

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.729 
can think of that would make it to where
it<00:03:19.579> was<00:03:19.730> like<00:03:19.910> okay<00:03:20.090> well<00:03:20.600> we<00:03:20.870> gotta<00:03:21.109> reset<00:03:21.500> him
