then<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:29.880> trailer<00:02:30.180> progresses<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:30.720> we<00:02:30.810> see<00:02:30.930> a

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
then the trailer progresses and we see a

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.870 
then the trailer progresses and we see a
little<00:02:31.290> bit<00:02:31.470> about<00:02:31.710> their<00:02:31.920> relationship<00:02:32.610> just

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.000 
little bit about their relationship just
for<00:02:33.000> this<00:02:33.150> trailer<00:02:33.570> feels<00:02:33.840> like<00:02:34.020> a<00:02:34.050> mix<00:02:34.440> of<00:02:34.680> the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
for this trailer feels like a mix of the

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.250 
for this trailer feels like a mix of the
land<00:02:35.190> before<00:02:35.340> time<00:02:35.550> meets<00:02:36.540> how<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:36.960> train<00:02:37.200> your

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
land before time meets how to train your

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.080 
land before time meets how to train your
dragon<00:02:37.470> now<00:02:38.340> I<00:02:38.400> same<00:02:38.610> land<00:02:38.820> before<00:02:38.940> time

dragon now I same land before time

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.510 
dragon now I same land before time
because<00:02:39.690> obviously<00:02:40.020> it's<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.620> dinosaur<00:02:40.950> film

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
because obviously it's a dinosaur film

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.190 
because obviously it's a dinosaur film
and<00:02:41.730> they<00:02:41.820> are<00:02:41.940> going<00:02:42.210> somewhere<00:02:42.660> in<00:02:43.050> this

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
and they are going somewhere in this

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.590 
and they are going somewhere in this
movie<00:02:43.950> there<00:02:44.160> doesn't<00:02:44.430> seem<00:02:44.490> to<00:02:44.670> be<00:02:44.760> one<00:02:45.120> place

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
movie there doesn't seem to be one place

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.570 
movie there doesn't seem to be one place
where<00:02:46.200> they're<00:02:46.350> hanging<00:02:46.650> out<00:02:46.770> it<00:02:47.010> seems<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.400> be

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
where they're hanging out it seems to be

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.010 
where they're hanging out it seems to be
sort<00:02:47.820> of<00:02:47.940> like<00:02:48.060> a<00:02:48.090> road<00:02:48.420> movie<00:02:48.690> they're

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
sort of like a road movie they're

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.990 
sort of like a road movie they're
traveling<00:02:49.530> from<00:02:49.800> point<00:02:50.100> A<00:02:50.220> to<00:02:50.250> point<00:02:50.400> B<00:02:50.670> and

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
traveling from point A to point B and

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.580 
traveling from point A to point B and
how<00:02:51.420> to<00:02:51.480> train<00:02:51.660> your<00:02:51.720> dragon<00:02:51.810> I<00:02:52.260> could<00:02:52.410> see

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
how to train your dragon I could see

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.350 
how to train your dragon I could see
this<00:02:52.770> relationship<00:02:53.040> between<00:02:53.760> Arlo<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.180> spot

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
this relationship between Arlo and spot

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.870 
this relationship between Arlo and spot
being<00:02:54.810> much<00:02:54.990> like<00:02:55.320> hiccup<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:56.040> toothless<00:02:56.100> you

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
being much like hiccup and toothless you

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.550 
being much like hiccup and toothless you
know<00:02:56.970> it's<00:02:57.090> interesting<00:02:57.180> at<00:02:57.630> least<00:02:57.660> to<00:02:58.020> me<00:02:58.260> in

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
know it's interesting at least to me in

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.920 
know it's interesting at least to me in
this<00:02:58.800> first<00:02:59.100> trailer<00:02:59.430> it<00:02:59.910> seems<00:03:00.480> that<00:03:00.570> spot

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
this first trailer it seems that spot

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.570 
this first trailer it seems that spot
even<00:03:01.260> though<00:03:01.350> he's<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.590> human<00:03:02.130> who<00:03:02.310> you<00:03:02.430> would

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
even though he's the human who you would

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.430 
even though he's the human who you would
traditionally<00:03:02.940> think<00:03:03.570> would<00:03:03.750> be<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:03.870> smart

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
traditionally think would be the smart

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.140 
traditionally think would be the smart
one<00:03:04.500> and<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.040> brave<00:03:05.730> one<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.090> the

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
one and the brave one and the

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.480 
one and the brave one and the
intelligent<00:03:06.630> one<00:03:06.660> and<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:06.960> one<00:03:07.080> leading<00:03:07.490> it

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
intelligent one and the one leading it

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.610 
intelligent one and the one leading it
actually<00:03:09.150> is<00:03:09.270> the<00:03:09.300> other<00:03:09.570> way<00:03:09.720> around<00:03:09.750> Arlo

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
actually is the other way around Arlo

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.860 
actually is the other way around Arlo
takes<00:03:10.980> more<00:03:11.220> of<00:03:11.310> like<00:03:11.460> the<00:03:11.610> human<00:03:11.870> human

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870
