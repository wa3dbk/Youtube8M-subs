00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
set it so it looks just like something a

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.549 
set it so it looks just like something a
wedge<00:00:39.180> but<00:00:39.390> if<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.629> bring<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.989> closer<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.440> the

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
wedge but if I bring it closer to the

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.610 
wedge but if I bring it closer to the
camera<00:00:41.180> be<00:00:42.180> right<00:00:42.360> there<00:00:42.390> see<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.050> paler

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
camera be right there see the paler

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.529 
camera be right there see the paler
yellow<00:00:44.100> kind<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.430> thing<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.510> sharp<00:00:46.050> if

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
yellow kind of thing that is a sharp if

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:54.619 
yellow kind of thing that is a sharp if
char<00:00:48.539> fast<00:00:48.840> blade<00:00:50.629> and<00:00:52.430> see<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.640> have<00:00:54.149> an<00:00:54.239> orange

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
char fast blade and see I have an orange

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.650 
char fast blade and see I have an orange
here<00:00:54.930> so<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.890> can<00:00:56.100> imagine<00:00:56.190> these<00:00:57.090> both<00:00:57.360> have

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
here so you can imagine these both have

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.689 
here so you can imagine these both have
something<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.440> do<00:00:58.590> with<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:59.129> presentations

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
something to do with the presentations

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.040 
something to do with the presentations
now<00:00:59.850> I'm<00:00:59.940> kneeling<00:01:00.149> down<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:00.870> just

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
now I'm kneeling down this is just

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.110 
now I'm kneeling down this is just
easier<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:01.829> basically<00:01:02.190> what<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:02.699> to

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
easier so basically what this is is to

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.600 
easier so basically what this is is to
make<00:01:03.239> orange<00:01:03.780> peeling<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.350> lot<00:01:04.559> easier<00:01:04.830> people

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
make orange peeling a lot easier people

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.460 
make orange peeling a lot easier people
like<00:01:05.729> me<00:01:05.880> who<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.510> know<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.750> grew<00:01:06.840> all<00:01:07.110> my<00:01:07.260> nails

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
because I guess you had to learn a young

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.520 
because I guess you had to learn a young
age<00:01:10.590> somebody<00:01:11.430> see<00:01:11.549> what<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.760> do<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.500> you<00:01:13.500> just

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
and then supposed to work and this is

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.109

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.630 
this will work but I would see so I'm
putting<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.030> against<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.420> orange<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:25.460> I<00:01:26.460> just

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
putting it against the orange and I just

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
lightly press none pulling it easy a

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.890 
lightly press none pulling it easy a
poll<00:01:35.180> very<00:01:36.180> easy<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.600> pull<00:01:36.780> actually<00:01:37.579> like

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
poll very easy to pull actually like

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.610 
poll very easy to pull actually like
slicing<00:01:39.900> butter

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
slicing butter

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.899 
slicing butter
alright

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:52.319 

okay<00:01:48.420> all<00:01:49.420> right<00:01:49.569> don't<00:01:49.719> even<00:01:50.409> cuts<00:01:50.649> but<00:01:51.329> see

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329 
okay all right don't even cuts but see

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:53.609 
okay all right don't even cuts but see
how<00:01:52.420> we<00:01:52.479> did<00:01:52.630> and<00:01:52.899> then<00:01:53.049> so<00:01:53.140> basically<00:01:53.499> what

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
how we did and then so basically what

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.770 
how we did and then so basically what
this<00:01:53.710> does<00:01:53.890> is<00:01:54.069> it<00:01:54.189> creates<00:01:54.340> a<00:01:54.670> ridge<00:01:54.909> need<00:01:55.630> to

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
this does is it creates a ridge need to

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.639 
this does is it creates a ridge need to
pull<00:01:56.049> back<00:01:56.079> on<00:01:56.560> and<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:59.439> starts<00:02:00.369> the<00:02:00.520> peeling

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
pull back on and that starts the peeling

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.510 
pull back on and that starts the peeling
so<00:02:02.649> then<00:02:02.799> you<00:02:02.890> don't<00:02:03.039> need<00:02:03.130> to<00:02:03.250> go<00:02:03.340> around

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
so then you don't need to go around

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.709 
so then you don't need to go around
asking<00:02:04.030> other<00:02:04.270> people<00:02:04.359> to<00:02:05.939> peel<00:02:06.939> them<00:02:07.060> for<00:02:07.479> you

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:07.719 
asking other people to peel them for you

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:09.690 
asking other people to peel them for you
and<00:02:07.899> you<00:02:08.709> know<00:02:08.799> if<00:02:08.920> you<00:02:08.979> can<00:02:09.129> peel<00:02:09.310> oranges

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
and you know if you can peel oranges

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.670 
and you know if you can peel oranges
then<00:02:09.940> whatever<00:02:10.269> you<00:02:11.140> don't<00:02:11.260> really<00:02:11.500> care

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
then whatever you don't really care
