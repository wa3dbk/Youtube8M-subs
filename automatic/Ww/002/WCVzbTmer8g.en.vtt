00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
I just kind of thought what what would I

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.939 
I just kind of thought what what would I
want<00:00:58.330> to<00:00:58.390> do<00:00:58.540> if<00:00:58.780> I<00:00:58.989> was<00:00:59.140> like<00:00:59.470> rich<00:00:59.710> and<00:00:59.830> famous

assigning me that I wanted to fill and

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.490 
assigning me that I wanted to fill and
then<00:01:03.970> I<00:01:04.269> find<00:01:04.479> out<00:01:04.600> that<00:01:04.720> was<00:01:04.839> a<00:01:04.869> child<00:01:05.170> like

to us a lot so I remember coming to see
the<00:01:23.470> show<00:01:23.500> when<00:01:23.710> I<00:01:23.770> was<00:01:23.860> younger<00:01:24.039> and<00:01:24.310> being

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
the show when I was younger and being

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.100 
the show when I was younger and being
like<00:01:24.610> whom<00:01:24.759> I<00:01:24.850> want<00:01:25.030> to<00:01:25.090> be<00:01:25.180> up<00:01:25.270> there<00:01:25.479> so<00:01:25.869> I

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
like whom I want to be up there so I

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.510 
like whom I want to be up there so I
think<00:01:26.530> that<00:01:26.649> that's<00:01:26.740> really<00:01:27.009> important<00:01:27.460> that

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
think that that's really important that

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.460 
think that that's really important that
they<00:01:27.640> come<00:01:27.820> and<00:01:28.000> they<00:01:28.119> look<00:01:28.899> up<00:01:29.050> to<00:01:29.080> us<00:01:29.229> and

they come and they look up to us and
want<00:01:29.619> to<00:01:29.649> be<00:01:29.740> us<00:01:29.860> one<00:01:30.009> day<00:01:30.070> I<00:01:30.310> think<00:01:30.729> that<00:01:31.090> the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
want to be us one day I think that the

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.540 
want to be us one day I think that the
little<00:01:31.390> kids<00:01:31.509> can<00:01:31.720> get<00:01:31.899> something<00:01:32.550> hugely

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
little kids can get something hugely

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.310 
little kids can get something hugely
different<00:01:33.850> out<00:01:34.060> of<00:01:34.149> it<00:01:34.240> than<00:01:34.390> the<00:01:34.780> adults<00:01:35.140> I

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
different out of it than the adults I

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.660 
different out of it than the adults I
remember<00:01:35.770> when<00:01:35.920> I<00:01:36.009> was<00:01:36.070> little<00:01:36.220> I<00:01:36.429> would<00:01:36.550> like

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
remember when I was little I would like

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.010 
remember when I was little I would like
sweep<00:01:36.970> around<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:37.270> house<00:01:37.479> singing<00:01:37.810> Hard

Knocks<00:01:38.050> like<00:01:38.320> all<00:01:38.530> the<00:01:38.649> time<00:01:38.860> so<00:01:39.039> I<00:01:39.069> think<00:01:39.399> they

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
Knocks like all the time so I think they

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.790 
Knocks like all the time so I think they
have<00:01:39.729> that<00:01:39.759> sort<00:01:40.209> of<00:01:40.289> magical<00:01:41.289> aspect<00:01:41.440> to

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
have that sort of magical aspect to

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.080 
have that sort of magical aspect to
where<00:01:41.979> they<00:01:42.130> they<00:01:42.459> want<00:01:42.670> to<00:01:42.759> be<00:01:42.849> up<00:01:42.940> there

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.760 
where they they want to be up there

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
sleeping twos I don't know I think it's

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.440
