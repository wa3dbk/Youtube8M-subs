to<00:04:00.240> address<00:04:00.780> your<00:04:00.959> problems<00:04:01.500> until<00:04:02.010> you<00:04:02.160> have

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
to address your problems until you have

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.240 
to address your problems until you have
magnified<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:03.180> Lord<00:04:03.390> to<00:04:03.660> the<00:04:03.780> point<00:04:04.080> that<00:04:04.380> he

is bigger than the problem and that's

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.800 
is bigger than the problem and that's
why<00:04:09.959> prayer<00:04:10.709> always<00:04:11.100> starts<00:04:11.820> with<00:04:11.910> magnifying
