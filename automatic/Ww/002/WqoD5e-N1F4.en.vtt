00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:12.799
 Two different marias tissues can be displayed on the Mac 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:18.140
 I'll try to stay. 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:21.650
 The label can do that because the two organizations are floating in opposite directions 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:26.780
 It has characteristics that are off-putting. 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:30.440
 Since the law allows Mary Anna characters appear again, then our hood 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:35.180
 The laryngeal end of the larynx is mainly used when connecting to each other . 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:36.560
 In order to make the colors look good, I have to go to the front to see these different colors. 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:43.430
 I made a connection. 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:45.530
 That's how it connects when you spread your organization around like this. 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.340
 Because the urine is connected. 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:53.870
 Let's see what's in front of the rocket. 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:57.110
 So gun on the back of a purl and purl purl 4 show each other so 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:01.790
 Put o'clock on face to close 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:03.860
 I 'll try to connect. First time we saw you , let me in front of you . 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.550
 I can see the tissue 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:13.340
 The organization on the occasion is the purse organization that looks on the outside 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:15.979
 So the frontal tissue is like backing up 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:20.960
 We should go in there like this. 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:26.010
 After that, the organization on the back looks like a purse when I saw it . 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:29.660
 From front to back 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.660
 I have a needle like this . 

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:38.960
 And because the thread of the organization that was in front of us differs from the color of the place 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.780
 It looks good. 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:46.039
 I got a needle in the lug 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.659
 Give me the needle galttae This is what the end is also facing selling so enter 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:51.950
 To the place where the deacon came 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:55.130
 From behind like that because then the next floating altitude plain at the purl 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:58.630
 The sky comes in. 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:05.860
 Alas you can not do this . 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:10.690
 Kill koko, too, so you can see the green seal coming out of the thread. 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:16.739
 In the meantime, while facing the nose of the breeze, 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.739
 You go in there and then it looks like a core-bust purple . 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:27.139
 So, the place where the last nose came out from the bosom 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:30.650
 Now Voyager yoreotge 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:36.469
 I can see the actual rock out of Rocco . 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:38.980
 Kokoro go back dopants eulyi the purl stitch that going into the next edition 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:38.980
 In a direction 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:52.940
 Now inside the likewise extremely Honey 7 in Loco in the room or from the nose joreotge 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:55.480
 To go to the arbitrariness of Silla on processing How do you then purl 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.480
 In a direction 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:08.420
 It is these things that go into the place of Silla 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:13.760
 Opening yoga 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:17.600
 When I looked at my nose, I looked half-turned 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:22.510
 In other words , if you have a needle in the future and give your nose 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:25.700
 It amounts to a back room before looking to purl that is when we are in the plain 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:29.050
 In the direction of poking half 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.050
 You will need to put in a drop of water. 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:48.629
 Let's go to Mary 's 2 keys. 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:49.769
 Just like a new one, now it's green. 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:53.459
 It looks like it. 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:55.260
 Yet because of the stretch to keep the tissue itself antiquity Mary Arsenal 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:04:00.930
 It is alive. 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:03.379
 So let's connect all the way to the last nose in a row. 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.379
 I'll do it 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:58.400
 It is as if 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:09.069
 I was able to do it as soon as possible. 

00:05:05.769 --> 00:05:12.759
 Now when this happens, 

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:18.550
 The connection is not dead. 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:22.029
 So let's assume there is one more nose at the end, and at the end is Silla. 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:27.249
 I think I'm going to connect the next one in the seat. 

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:35.909
 But because there is no next Korean because there is not. 

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:35.909
 105 After you finish the rest of the top, put the needle one more time 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.770
 like this 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.949
 It is finished to be able to know Mary
