it can come apart moderately easy now we

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.010 
it can come apart moderately easy now we

have our front and with flip fire
missiles<00:02:56.440> you<00:02:56.680> can<00:02:56.800> push<00:02:57.010> on<00:02:57.190> this<00:02:57.370> little<00:02:57.610> tab

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
missiles you can push on this little tab

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.950 
missiles you can push on this little tab
right<00:02:58.030> here<00:02:58.150> and<00:03:00.330> they<00:03:01.330> will<00:03:01.420> fire<00:03:01.630> out<00:03:01.840> they

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 
right here and they will fire out they

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.230 
right here and they will fire out they
fire<00:03:02.170> really<00:03:02.650> well<00:03:02.800> I<00:03:03.100> really<00:03:03.970> like<00:03:04.120> the

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
fire really well I really like the

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.880 
fire really well I really like the
firing<00:03:04.480> mechanism<00:03:05.170> on<00:03:05.260> this<00:03:05.440> because<00:03:05.620> it

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
firing mechanism on this because it

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.320 
firing mechanism on this because it
doesn't<00:03:06.190> require<00:03:06.490> flicking<00:03:07.090> and<00:03:07.470> it<00:03:08.470> simple

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
doesn't require flicking and it simple

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.470 
doesn't require flicking and it simple
move<00:03:10.330> on<00:03:10.510> we<00:03:10.930> have<00:03:10.960> our<00:03:11.320> turret<00:03:12.180> rotates<00:03:13.180> 360

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
move on we have our turret rotates 360

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.420 
move on we have our turret rotates 360
and<00:03:14.140> it<00:03:14.200> moves<00:03:14.410> up<00:03:14.650> at<00:03:14.830> a<00:03:14.860> 90<00:03:15.160> degree<00:03:15.250> angle

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
and it moves up at a 90 degree angle

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.940 
and it moves up at a 90 degree angle
just<00:03:16.470> like<00:03:17.470> that

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
just like that

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.880 
just like that
like<00:03:18.790> I<00:03:18.820> said<00:03:18.940> sticker<00:03:19.360> here<00:03:19.690> and<00:03:20.530> then<00:03:20.740> you

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
like I said sticker here and then you

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.940 
like I said sticker here and then you
have<00:03:20.920> your<00:03:21.310> cabin<00:03:21.820> where<00:03:21.970> the<00:03:22.120> person<00:03:22.450> sits

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
have your cabin where the person sits

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.100 
have your cabin where the person sits

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
before the gun it's a really deep and

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
before the gun it's a really deep and
that's<00:03:26.320> one<00:03:26.530> of<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:26.680> things<00:03:26.830> I<00:03:26.920> don't<00:03:26.980> like

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
that's one of the things I don't like

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.470 
that's one of the things I don't like

the<00:04:45.719> problem<00:04:45.870> with<00:04:46.139> this<00:04:46.229> set<00:04:46.439> is<00:04:46.590> there's<00:04:46.770> not

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
the problem with this set is there's not

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:48.830 
the problem with this set is there's not
many<00:04:47.099> features<00:04:47.669> to<00:04:47.969> it<00:04:48.120> so<00:04:48.360> this<00:04:48.509> isn't<00:04:48.750> gonna

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
many features to it so this isn't gonna

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.869 
many features to it so this isn't gonna
be<00:04:48.930> a<00:04:49.020> long<00:04:49.229> review<00:04:49.770> in<00:04:50.280> fact<00:04:50.580> it's<00:04:50.759> almost

00:04:50.869 --> 00:04:50.879 
be a long review in fact it's almost

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:56.390 
be a long review in fact it's almost
done<00:04:51.210> but<00:04:52.110> I<00:04:52.379> do<00:04:54.199> applaud<00:04:55.199> Lego<00:04:55.860> for<00:04:56.069> making

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
done but I do applaud Lego for making

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.790 
done but I do applaud Lego for making
this<00:04:56.520> because<00:04:56.939> I<00:04:56.969> think<00:04:57.120> it's<00:04:57.389> a<00:04:57.479> great<00:04:57.810> way<00:04:58.770> to

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
this because I think it's a great way to

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.429 
this because I think it's a great way to
build<00:04:59.400> like<00:04:59.729> a<00:04:59.759> certain<00:05:00.180> pirate<00:05:00.780> army<00:05:01.169> so<00:05:01.349> you

00:05:01.429 --> 00:05:01.439 
build like a certain pirate army so you

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:04.700 
build like a certain pirate army so you
can<00:05:01.590> have<00:05:01.770> them<00:05:01.889> attack<00:05:02.189> whatever<00:05:02.430> and<00:05:03.379> it's<00:05:04.379> a

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
can have them attack whatever and it's a

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.459 
can have them attack whatever and it's a
good<00:05:04.919> size<00:05:05.219> it's<00:05:05.969> almost<00:05:06.689> as<00:05:06.870> big<00:05:06.990> as<00:05:07.139> the<00:05:07.259> box

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:07.469 
good size it's almost as big as the box

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:11.390 
good size it's almost as big as the box
the<00:05:08.370> box<00:05:08.400> is<00:05:08.819> about<00:05:09.060> a<00:05:09.300> foot<00:05:09.569> and<00:05:10.340> probably<00:05:11.340> a

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
the box is about a foot and probably a

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.140 
the box is about a foot and probably a
third<00:05:11.840> long<00:05:12.840> and<00:05:13.229> this<00:05:14.189> is<00:05:14.340> probably<00:05:14.849> a<00:05:14.939> foot

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
third long and this is probably a foot

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.600 
third long and this is probably a foot
long<00:05:15.330> but<00:05:15.629> I<00:05:15.659> really<00:05:15.689> like<00:05:16.050> that

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
long but I really like that

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.899 
long but I really like that
so<00:05:17.610> yeah<00:05:18.029> that's<00:05:18.569> basically<00:05:18.810> the<00:05:19.229> pirate<00:05:19.789> tank

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:20.909 
so yeah that's basically the pirate tank

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:23.749 
so yeah that's basically the pirate tank
so<00:05:21.779> this<00:05:21.900> is<00:05:22.050> where<00:05:22.199> close<00:05:22.349> 5<00:05:22.650> on<00:05:22.889> 8<00:05:23.039> signing

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 
so this is where close 5 on 8 signing

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:31.959 
so this is where close 5 on 8 signing
out

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:31.969 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:34.029
