00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
Kentucky Digger quickly yeah I think

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.000 
Kentucky Digger quickly yeah I think
they<00:02:09.929> are<00:02:10.019> because<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.320> their<00:02:10.500> style<00:02:10.739> of<00:02:10.950> play

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
they are because of their style of play

you just take your patience get it done
you're<00:02:23.970> right<00:02:24.150> about<00:02:24.269> Dale<00:02:24.630> and<00:02:24.900> Wittman

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
you're right about Dale and Wittman

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.990

combining<00:02:25.680> for<00:02:25.830> 50<00:02:26.160> points<00:02:26.519> but<00:02:26.850> more

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
combining for 50 points but more

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.699 
combining for 50 points but more
importantly<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:27.480> just<00:02:27.780> thought<00:02:27.930> that<00:02:27.989> it<00:02:28.560> was

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
importantly I just thought that it was

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.140 
importantly I just thought that it was
the<00:02:28.739> flow<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.070> game<00:02:29.370> they<00:02:29.580> take<00:02:29.820> care<00:02:30.000> of<00:02:30.060> the

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
the flow to game they take care of the

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.910 
the flow to game they take care of the
ball<00:02:30.330> they<00:02:30.660> only<00:02:30.780> had<00:02:30.959> eight<00:02:31.200> turnovers<00:02:31.530> and

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
ball they only had eight turnovers and

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.110 
ball they only had eight turnovers and
that's<00:02:32.040> one<00:02:32.220> thing<00:02:32.400> Kentucky<00:02:32.820> is<00:02:32.910> going<00:02:33.000> to

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
that's one thing Kentucky is going to

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.570 
that's one thing Kentucky is going to
try<00:02:33.299> to<00:02:33.360> do<00:02:33.570> not<00:02:34.170> against<00:02:34.680> this<00:02:34.769> very<00:02:34.950> patient

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
try to do not against this very patient

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.360 
try to do not against this very patient
