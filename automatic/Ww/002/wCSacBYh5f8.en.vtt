00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.380

 English or French or any other 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.260
 language that may have come from the game 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.510
 therefore this translation has as 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.489
 to leave not only the least of your 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.860

 First you must have got it for you. 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.100
 power is to use this translation as if

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.360
 shizuoka strat program or any 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.869
 another program that leaves your game in 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.110
 god points checks because only the game in god 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.000
 point checks we can do 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.970
 changes directly in the game is right 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.729
 if you do not know how to leave your game 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.229
