and why I am not using a screen test
there's<00:02:11.790> simple<00:02:14.190> sort<00:02:15.190> of<00:02:15.280> answer<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:15.640> this

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
there's simple sort of answer to this

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.970 
there's simple sort of answer to this
if<00:02:16.390> using<00:02:16.720> screen<00:02:17.230> tells<00:02:17.440> on<00:02:17.650> full<00:02:17.860> brightness

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
if using screen tells on full brightness

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.900 
if using screen tells on full brightness
you<00:02:18.459> will<00:02:18.640> not<00:02:18.730> recognize<00:02:18.970> as<00:02:19.420> so<00:02:19.630> much<00:02:19.810> as<00:02:19.870> in

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
you will not recognize as so much as in

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.740 
you will not recognize as so much as in
lower<00:02:21.910> brightness<00:02:22.330> of<00:02:22.660> the<00:02:22.780> display<00:02:22.930> and<00:02:24.750> also
