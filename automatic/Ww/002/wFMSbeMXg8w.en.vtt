 Hi, I'm Chris Jaffe from Netflix. 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.550
 I want to show you how to use Netflix on your Xbox. 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.760
 To download Netflix on the Xbox, go to the app 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:15.770
 the overview here. 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.630
 Go to Netflix and press Select. 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.430
 You must have a LIVE Gold account to use Netlix. 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.310
 You must either create an Xbox LIVE account 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.840
 or log in with an existing account. 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.685
 When signed in with Xbox LIVE, I can download the app. 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.420
 First you see that you can choose ours 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.900
 Netflix Only for kids experience or the normal Netflix experience. 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.450
 I want to choose the normal Netflix experience. 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.610
 When Netflix is ​​loaded, you see all of these 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.790
 Rows of good movies and TV shows you can see. 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.770
 You can go up and down using the controller 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.310
 through all the lists. 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.790
 And you find all those titles. 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.780
 When you stop at a title, more information is displayed 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.050
 right here about the title. 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.610
 And it is incredibly easy to play a title. 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.370
 Just select Play. 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.310
 Press A on the controller and then playback begins. 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.340
 While it loads, a lot of information about the series is displayed 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.110
 on the screen as well as various functions to select other episodes 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.880
 and configure audio settings and subtitles. 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.440
 Let's do it. 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.110
 Let's look at the audio settings and subtitles. 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.210
 Press down to bring up the menu, switch to the audio and subtitle option, 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.509
 and select it. The subtitles appear right here on your Xbox. 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.060
 There are also other features on the Xbox. 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.810
 You can judge the series directly here. 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.759
 I like "House of Cards" so I give it 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:48.630
 five stars. 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.190
 And the score is immediately displayed. 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.550
 I can go back and it all happens while I play. 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.000
 It is also really easy to fast forward and rewind. 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.660
 I get the menu and can fast forward. 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.780
 You can search for a title in Netflix at any time 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.910
 And it's really easy. 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.330
 Just press Y on the controller and the search box will appear. 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.210
 And then you just enter characters. 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.000
 Here I have entered HOU because I am searching for "House of Cards". 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.381
 "House of Cards" is the first result. 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:22.530
