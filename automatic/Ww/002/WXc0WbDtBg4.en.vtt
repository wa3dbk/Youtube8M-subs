00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.040 
I didn't met their tips how to wear
hijab<00:02:38.530> I<00:02:38.890> didn't<00:02:39.430> mention<00:02:39.580> if<00:02:40.450> you<00:02:40.510> cannot<00:02:40.840> tie

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
hijab I didn't mention if you cannot tie

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.770 
hijab I didn't mention if you cannot tie
it<00:02:41.110> from<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:41.470> packet<00:02:41.830> to<00:02:41.950> a<00:02:41.980> nice<00:02:42.190> tie<00:02:42.400> try<00:02:43.090> one

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
it from the packet to a nice tie try one

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.979 
it from the packet to a nice tie try one
of<00:02:43.810> my<00:02:44.080> technique<00:02:44.440> is<00:02:44.739> switch<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.880> site<00:02:46.120> left

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
of my technique is switch the site left

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.620 
of my technique is switch the site left
to<00:02:47.530> right<00:02:47.709> and<00:02:48.040> right<00:02:48.130> to<00:02:48.250> live<00:02:48.550> the<00:02:49.150> reason<00:02:49.330> I

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
to right and right to live the reason I

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.100 
to right and right to live the reason I
do<00:02:49.690> this<00:02:50.040> just<00:02:51.040> to<00:02:51.190> cover<00:02:51.489> the<00:02:51.610> nut<00:02:52.000> you<00:02:52.690> know

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
do this just to cover the nut you know

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.020 
do this just to cover the nut you know
what<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.380> original<00:02:53.470> not<00:02:54.010> because<00:02:54.400> it's<00:02:54.880> gonna

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
what the original not because it's gonna

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.400 
what the original not because it's gonna
look<00:02:55.209> ugly<00:02:55.630> if<00:02:55.780> you're<00:02:55.900> gonna<00:02:56.020> leave<00:02:56.260> it<00:02:56.380> like

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
look ugly if you're gonna leave it like

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.650 
look ugly if you're gonna leave it like
this<00:02:56.590> so<00:02:57.370> when<00:02:57.550> you<00:02:57.610> cover<00:02:57.880> it<00:02:58.120> it<00:02:58.360> give<00:02:58.510> you<00:02:58.630> a

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
this so when you cover it it give you a

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.920 
this so when you cover it it give you a
nice<00:02:58.930> shape<00:02:58.959> from<00:02:59.470> the<00:02:59.680> back<00:02:59.860> and<00:03:00.820> second<00:03:01.810> you

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
nice shape from the back and second you

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.260 
nice shape from the back and second you
know<00:03:02.080> it's<00:03:03.010> gonna<00:03:03.190> reduce<00:03:03.400> from<00:03:03.880> the<00:03:04.030> length

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
know it's gonna reduce from the length

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.260 
know it's gonna reduce from the length
so<00:03:04.989> there<00:03:05.410> is<00:03:05.530> no<00:03:05.709> need<00:03:05.770> to<00:03:06.640> leave<00:03:06.790> extra

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
so there is no need to leave extra

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.530 
so there is no need to leave extra
fabric<00:03:07.570> hanging<00:03:07.989> down<00:03:08.459> anyway<00:03:09.459> I<00:03:09.700> did<00:03:10.239> switch
