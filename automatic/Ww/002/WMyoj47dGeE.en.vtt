00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
name like now so she gave me the idea to

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.490 
name like now so she gave me the idea to
do<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.630> will<00:01:06.930> link<00:01:07.049> her<00:01:07.200> channel<00:01:07.229> down

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
do that I will link her channel down

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.420 
do that I will link her channel down
below<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:08.900> so<00:01:09.900> basically<00:01:10.290> it's<00:01:10.710> basically

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
below and so basically it's basically

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.179 
below and so basically it's basically
make<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.420> hottest<00:01:12.810> alien<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.740> can<00:01:13.860> ever<00:01:14.040> make

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
make the hottest alien you can ever make

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.120 
make the hottest alien you can ever make
so<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:14.909> guess<00:01:15.869> that's<00:01:16.049> basically<00:01:16.320> what<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.890> tag

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
so I guess that's basically what the tag

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.149 
so I guess that's basically what the tag
is<00:01:17.369> make<00:01:18.030> an<00:01:18.180> alien<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.830> can<00:01:19.950> use

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
is make an alien and you can use

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.399 
is make an alien and you can use
whatever<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:21.119> want<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.420> use<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:22.020> can<00:01:22.170> make<00:01:22.259> as

whatever you want to use you can make as

whatever you want to use you can make as
