00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
luckily it paid off we went up I think

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.249 
luckily it paid off we went up I think
the<00:04:51.430> club<00:04:51.610> would've<00:04:51.849> been<00:04:51.940> in<00:04:52.060> quite<00:04:52.990> a<00:04:53.020> big

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:53.259 
the club would've been in quite a big

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:55.230 
the club would've been in quite a big
state<00:04:53.800> of<00:04:53.889> affairs<00:04:54.190> if<00:04:54.400> we<00:04:54.520> hadn't<00:04:54.789> Gordon

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
state of affairs if we hadn't Gordon

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.029 
state of affairs if we hadn't Gordon
Strachan<00:04:55.449> probably<00:04:55.930> one<00:04:56.050> of<00:04:56.080> the<00:04:56.259> most

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:57.039 
Strachan probably one of the most

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:58.860 
Strachan probably one of the most
professional<00:04:57.430> pros<00:04:58.000> I've<00:04:58.240> ever<00:04:58.419> played<00:04:58.660> with

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
professional pros I've ever played with

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.089 
professional pros I've ever played with
there<00:04:59.259> obviously<00:04:59.500> weren't<00:04:59.680> many<00:04:59.919> at

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:00.099 
there obviously weren't many at

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:01.770 
there obviously weren't many at
Wimbledon<00:05:00.550> not<00:05:00.940> in<00:05:01.030> the<00:05:01.090> first<00:05:01.360> time<00:05:01.539> around

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
Wimbledon not in the first time around

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.740 
Wimbledon not in the first time around
anyway<00:05:02.169> they<00:05:02.560> were<00:05:02.710> all<00:05:02.889> there

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
anyway they were all there

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.570 
anyway they were all there
there<00:05:04.750> was<00:05:04.840> a<00:05:04.870> lunatics<00:05:05.409> but<00:05:05.620> the<00:05:06.130> Strachan

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
there was a lunatics but the Strachan

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.850 
there was a lunatics but the Strachan
was<00:05:06.610> probably<00:05:06.970> one<00:05:07.120> of<00:05:07.150> the<00:05:07.300> first<00:05:07.509> or<00:05:08.229> still

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
was probably one of the first or still

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.070 
was probably one of the first or still
is<00:05:09.009> the<00:05:09.340> mr.<00:05:09.909> number<00:05:10.240> one<00:05:10.389> Pro<00:05:10.630> that<00:05:10.810> I<00:05:10.840> played

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
is the mr. number one Pro that I played

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.230 
is the mr. number one Pro that I played
with<00:05:11.110> he<00:05:11.500> trained<00:05:11.860> he<00:05:12.250> trained<00:05:12.610> with<00:05:12.880> his

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
with he trained he trained with his

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.580 
with he trained he trained with his
heart<00:05:13.479> and<00:05:13.630> so<00:05:13.870> I<00:05:13.900> think<00:05:14.289> I<00:05:14.500> think<00:05:15.400> he<00:05:15.580> sort<00:05:15.849> of

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
heart and so I think I think he sort of

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.999 
heart and so I think I think he sort of
he<00:05:17.590> got<00:05:17.830> through<00:05:18.069> to<00:05:18.280> the<00:05:18.370> other<00:05:18.490> players<00:05:18.849> that

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:20.009 
he got through to the other players that

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:22.680 
he got through to the other players that
how<00:05:21.009> important<00:05:21.490> it<00:05:21.580> was<00:05:21.729> we<00:05:22.090> were<00:05:22.240> there<00:05:22.419> to<00:05:22.539> do

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
how important it was we were there to do

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.689 
how important it was we were there to do
