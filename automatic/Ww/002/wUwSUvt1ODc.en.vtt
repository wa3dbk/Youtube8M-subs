RNIB<00:00:23.070> they<00:00:23.490> created<00:00:24.150> something<00:00:24.359> which<00:00:24.660> is

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
RNIB they created something which is

started<00:00:59.300> what<00:01:00.300> we<00:01:00.449> see<00:01:00.660> here<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.550> basically<00:01:02.550> a

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
started what we see here is basically a

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.320 
started what we see here is basically a
piece<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.840> paper<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:05.869> if<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:07.290> will<00:01:07.439> print<00:01:07.619> this

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
piece of paper and if it will print this

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.030 
piece of paper and if it will print this
the<00:01:09.330> first<00:01:09.630> thing<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:10.170> would<00:01:10.470> notice<00:01:10.680> is

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
the first thing that you would notice is

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.219 
the first thing that you would notice is
that<00:01:11.070> it's<00:01:11.340> way<00:01:11.760> too<00:01:11.820> small<00:01:12.090> for<00:01:12.270> visually

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
that it's way too small for visually

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.350 
that it's way too small for visually
impaired<00:01:13.260> musicians<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.640> what<00:01:14.880> we<00:01:15.060> want<00:01:15.240> to

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
impaired musicians so what we want to

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.039 
impaired musicians so what we want to
change<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.810> overall<00:01:16.259> font<00:01:16.680> size<00:01:16.909> of<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.810> the

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
change the overall font size of of the

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.390 
change the overall font size of of the
score<00:01:20.030> for<00:01:21.030> doing<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.390> we<00:01:21.540> go<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.750> layout

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
score for doing that we go to layout

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.960 
score for doing that we go to layout
page<00:01:23.400> settings<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.770> we<00:01:25.770> have<00:01:25.920> here<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.490> scaling

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
page settings and we have here a scaling

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.530 
page settings and we have here a scaling
factor<00:01:27.560> which<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.770> basically<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.540> called

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
factor which is basically is called

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.690 
factor which is basically is called
space<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.259> space<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.070> distance<00:01:32.460> between

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
space and space is the distance between

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.289 
space and space is the distance between
two<00:01:33.299> staff<00:01:33.659> lines<00:01:34.460> so<00:01:35.460> we<00:01:35.610> can<00:01:35.790> bring<00:01:35.939> us<00:01:36.119> up

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
two staff lines so we can bring us up

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.420 
two staff lines so we can bring us up
and<00:01:36.540> while<00:01:36.810> we<00:01:36.990> do<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.140> at<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.770> right<00:01:37.979> we<00:01:38.400> see

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
and while we do that at the right we see

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.190 
and while we do that at the right we see
the<00:01:38.700> preview<00:01:39.119> changing<00:01:39.570> if<00:01:40.350> we<00:01:40.950> apply<00:01:41.159> this

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
the preview changing if we apply this

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.550 
the preview changing if we apply this
then<00:01:43.200> we<00:01:43.409> see<00:01:43.619> now<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:43.829> we<00:01:44.220> have<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.729> page

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
then we see now that we have a page

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.730 
then we see now that we have a page
where<00:01:46.560> those<00:01:46.860> two<00:01:47.100> lines<00:01:47.130> are<00:01:47.610> now<00:01:47.880> nicely

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
where those two lines are now nicely

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.980 
where those two lines are now nicely
spread<00:01:49.740> over<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.250> full<00:01:50.430> page<00:01:50.750> so<00:01:51.750> that's

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
spread over the full page so that's

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.440 
spread over the full page so that's
already<00:01:52.140> much<00:01:52.470> better<00:01:53.000> however<00:01:54.000> there's

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
already much better however there's

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.060 
already much better however there's
still<00:01:54.540> some<00:01:54.810> issues<00:01:54.930> here<00:01:56.299> often<00:01:57.890> things<00:01:58.890> like

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
still some issues here often things like

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.260 
still some issues here often things like
staff<00:01:59.460> lines<00:01:59.759> are<00:02:00.229> way<00:02:01.229> too<00:02:01.290> thin<00:02:01.649> for<00:02:02.270> vision

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
staff lines are way too thin for vision

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.440 
and those beams that are colliding with
stoplights<00:02:17.160> so<00:02:18.160> these<00:02:18.370> are<00:02:18.550> all<00:02:18.670> things<00:02:18.850> that

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
stoplights so these are all things that

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.300 
stoplights so these are all things that
we<00:02:19.660> want<00:02:19.870> to<00:02:19.990> change<00:02:20.260> in<00:02:20.560> terms<00:02:20.800> of<00:02:21.070> thickness

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
we want to change in terms of thickness

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.110 
we want to change in terms of thickness
or<00:02:21.730> size<00:02:22.380> so<00:02:23.380> let's<00:02:23.560> get<00:02:23.740> started<00:02:24.100> with<00:02:24.370> the

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
or size so let's get started with the

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.840 
or size so let's get started with the
stoplights<00:02:25.620> in<00:02:26.620> order<00:02:26.890> to<00:02:27.040> do<00:02:27.130> that<00:02:27.250> we<00:02:27.490> go<00:02:27.670> in

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
stoplights in order to do that we go in

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.180 
stoplights in order to do that we go in
the<00:02:27.940> manual<00:02:28.240> to<00:02:28.300> style<00:02:29.010> general<00:02:30.360> and<00:02:32.190> stop

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
the manual to style general and stop

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.690 
the manual to style general and stop
lines<00:02:33.460> are<00:02:33.730> property<00:02:34.270> of<00:02:34.480> measure<00:02:35.520> so<00:02:36.520> down

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
lines are property of measure so down

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.260 
lines are property of measure so down
here<00:02:37.000> stop<00:02:37.360> line<00:02:37.570> thickness<00:02:37.960> we<00:02:38.890> can<00:02:39.270> make

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
here stop line thickness we can make

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.730 
here stop line thickness we can make
that<00:02:40.420> a<00:02:40.480> bit<00:02:40.690> bigger<00:02:40.950> let's<00:02:41.950> make<00:02:42.190> it<00:02:42.220> 0.15

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
that a bit bigger let's make it 0.15

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.680 
that a bit bigger let's make it 0.15
space<00:02:44.740> spaceship<00:02:45.670> which<00:02:46.060> is<00:02:46.210> the<00:02:46.330> distance

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
space spaceship which is the distance

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.310 
space spaceship which is the distance
between<00:02:47.200> to<00:02:47.530> stop<00:02:47.740> lines<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:49.110> there<00:02:50.110> we<00:02:50.200> go

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
between to stop lines and there we go

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.010 
between to stop lines and there we go
that's<00:02:50.740> all<00:02:51.070> very<00:02:51.250> much<00:02:51.430> better<00:02:51.810> now<00:02:52.810> let's

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
that's all very much better now let's

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.110 
that's all very much better now let's
continue<00:02:53.320> with<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:54.100> ledger<00:02:54.280> lines<00:02:54.610> as<00:02:54.910> well

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
continue with the ledger lines as well

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:04.410 
continue with the ledger lines as well
as<00:02:55.240> the<00:02:55.360> notes<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:58.120> dots<00:02:58.330> I<00:02:58.480> mean<00:03:03.420> natural

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
as the notes the dots I mean natural

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.880 
as the notes the dots I mean natural
lines<00:03:04.600> we<00:03:04.780> can<00:03:04.900> find<00:03:05.170> under<00:03:05.410> the<00:03:05.710> notes

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
lines we can find under the notes

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.220 
lines we can find under the notes
section<00:03:07.950> over<00:03:08.950> here<00:03:09.450> so<00:03:10.450> let's<00:03:10.660> bring<00:03:10.900> that<00:03:10.960> up

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
section over here so let's bring that up

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.140 
section over here so let's bring that up
a<00:03:11.350> bit

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
a bit

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.120 
a bit
we<00:03:13.150> apply<00:03:13.420> let<00:03:14.350> me<00:03:14.500> see<00:03:14.680> it<00:03:14.740> so<00:03:14.890> very<00:03:14.980> much

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
we apply let me see it so very much

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.290 
we apply let me see it so very much
bigger<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:17.140> dot<00:03:17.320> size<00:03:17.530> current<00:03:17.830> is<00:03:17.950> at<00:03:18.300> 100%

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
bigger the dot size current is at 100%

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.330 
bigger the dot size current is at 100%
let's<00:03:19.840> meet<00:03:20.020> at<00:03:20.170> 114<00:03:22.230> boom<00:03:23.230> there<00:03:24.100> you<00:03:24.160> go

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
let's meet at 114 boom there you go

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.720 
let's meet at 114 boom there you go
that's<00:03:24.700> already<00:03:24.970> much<00:03:25.210> better<00:03:26.280> let's<00:03:27.280> go<00:03:27.490> down

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
that's already much better let's go down

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.730 
that's already much better let's go down
and<00:03:28.620> tackle<00:03:29.620> oops<00:03:30.300> so<00:03:31.300> bad<00:03:31.540> that<00:03:31.570> let's<00:03:32.140> go<00:03:32.380> and

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
and tackle oops so bad that let's go and

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:39.560 
and tackle oops so bad that let's go and
tackle<00:03:33.250> these<00:03:33.670> slurs<00:03:36.180> against<00:03:37.180> tile<00:03:37.540> general

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
tackle these slurs against tile general

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.570 
tackle these slurs against tile general
we<00:03:40.570> go<00:03:40.720> to<00:03:40.780> the<00:03:41.020> slurs<00:03:41.290> here<00:03:41.800> and<00:03:42.190> what<00:03:42.340> we<00:03:42.430> can

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
we go to the slurs here and what we can

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.250 
we go to the slurs here and what we can
do<00:03:42.700> is<00:03:42.790> you<00:03:42.880> can<00:03:43.060> change<00:03:43.240> the<00:03:43.690> thickness<00:03:43.900> at

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
do is you can change the thickness at

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.940 
do is you can change the thickness at
the<00:03:44.290> beginning<00:03:44.740> as<00:03:44.890> well<00:03:45.070> as<00:03:45.250> at<00:03:45.520> the<00:03:45.730> end<00:03:46.950> so

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
the beginning as well as at the end so

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.880 
the beginning as well as at the end so
let's<00:03:48.130> bring<00:03:48.400> that<00:03:48.550> up<00:03:49.200> sorry<00:03:50.200> the<00:03:50.530> thickness

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
let's bring that up sorry the thickness

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.970 
let's bring that up sorry the thickness
at<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:51.100> beginning<00:03:51.490> and<00:03:51.640> in<00:03:52.120> the<00:03:52.150> middle<00:03:52.980> so

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
at the beginning and in the middle so

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.270 
at the beginning and in the middle so
the<00:03:54.010> beginning<00:03:54.430> or<00:03:54.610> the<00:03:54.640> end<00:03:54.850> is<00:03:55.060> the<00:03:55.150> same<00:03:56.280> so

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
the beginning or the end is the same so

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.980 
the beginning or the end is the same so
when<00:03:57.430> we<00:03:57.550> apply<00:03:57.610> this<00:03:57.820> we<00:03:58.330> see<00:03:58.600> it's<00:03:58.840> already

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:58.990 
when we apply this we see it's already

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.250 
when we apply this we see it's already
much<00:03:59.470> much<00:03:59.740> better<00:04:00.570> now<00:04:01.570> one<00:04:01.810> thing<00:04:02.020> that<00:04:02.170> we

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
much much better now one thing that we

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.750 
much much better now one thing that we
see<00:04:02.290> here<00:04:02.680> are<00:04:02.950> the<00:04:03.130> beams<00:04:03.370> that<00:04:03.640> are

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
see here are the beams that are

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.940 
see here are the beams that are
colliding<00:04:04.300> with<00:04:04.420> these<00:04:04.570> top<00:04:04.810> lights<00:04:05.050> so<00:04:05.710> let's

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
colliding with these top lights so let's

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.160 
colliding with these top lights so let's
make<00:04:06.160> sure<00:04:06.190> that<00:04:06.670> it's<00:04:06.970> not<00:04:07.090> happening<00:04:07.600> and<00:04:07.840> we

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
make sure that it's not happening and we

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.460 
make sure that it's not happening and we
can<00:04:08.320> do<00:04:08.500> so<00:04:08.680> by<00:04:08.710> checking<00:04:09.520> this<00:04:09.880> checkbox

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
can do so by checking this checkbox

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.870 
can do so by checking this checkbox
flatten<00:04:11.470> all<00:04:11.650> beams<00:04:12.900> apply<00:04:14.460> there<00:04:15.460> you<00:04:15.550> go

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
flatten all beams apply there you go

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.920 
flatten all beams apply there you go
much<00:04:16.210> better<00:04:18.060> now<00:04:19.060> we<00:04:19.120> don't<00:04:19.420> want<00:04:19.570> to<00:04:19.660> do<00:04:19.780> this

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
much better now we don't want to do this

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.409 
much better now we don't want to do this
over<00:04:20.170> and<00:04:20.410> over<00:04:20.590> again<00:04:20.680> for<00:04:21.190> each<00:04:21.340> one's<00:04:21.729> each

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
over and over again for each one's each

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:24.090 
over and over again for each one's each
single<00:04:22.930> score

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
single score

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.060 
single score
so<00:04:24.700> in<00:04:24.880> this<00:04:25.030> case<00:04:25.300> we<00:04:25.660> love<00:04:26.170> to<00:04:26.530> save<00:04:26.890> the

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
so in this case we love to save the

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:37.350 
so in this case we love to save the
style<00:04:33.540> and<00:04:34.540> we<00:04:34.720> save<00:04:34.930> it<00:04:35.080> and<00:04:35.970> next<00:04:36.970> time<00:04:37.120> that

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
style and we save it and next time that

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.120 
style and we save it and next time that
we<00:04:37.450> open<00:04:37.720> a<00:04:37.780> new<00:04:37.900> score<00:04:38.260> will<00:04:38.650> be<00:04:38.800> simply

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
we open a new score will be simply

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.020 
we open a new score will be simply
bloody<00:04:39.400> style

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
bloody style

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.090 
bloody style
for<00:04:40.960> the<00:04:41.020> sake<00:04:41.200> of<00:04:41.290> this<00:04:41.410> demo<00:04:41.650> I'm<00:04:41.830> going<00:04:41.890> to

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
for the sake of this demo I'm going to

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:48.870 
for the sake of this demo I'm going to
close<00:04:42.630> this<00:04:43.630> core<00:04:44.220> open<00:04:45.220> it<00:04:45.310> again<00:04:47.790> there<00:04:48.790> we

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
close this core open it again there we
