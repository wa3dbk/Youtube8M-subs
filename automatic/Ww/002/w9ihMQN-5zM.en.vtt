00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:57.880 
the right hand side of the screen you

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.299 
the right hand side of the screen you
have<00:00:58.090> the<00:00:58.360> filter<00:00:58.720> options<00:00:59.140> pane<00:00:59.440> there<00:01:00.160> are

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
have the filter options pane there are

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:01.620 
have the filter options pane there are
lots<00:01:00.430> of<00:01:00.640> different<00:01:01.000> ways<00:01:01.030> that<00:01:01.390> you<00:01:01.420> can

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:01.630 
lots of different ways that you can

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.540 
lots of different ways that you can
adjust<00:01:01.719> this<00:01:02.110> filter<00:01:02.530> and<00:01:02.800> I<00:01:03.130> think<00:01:03.340> one<00:01:03.520> of

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
adjust this filter and I think one of

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.399 
adjust this filter and I think one of
the<00:01:03.730> most<00:01:03.910> important<00:01:04.420> is<00:01:04.540> to<00:01:04.600> control<00:01:05.229> the

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
the most important is to control the

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.130 
the most important is to control the
brightness<00:01:05.650> and<00:01:06.190> the<00:01:06.520> saturation<00:01:07.330> of<00:01:07.510> your

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
brightness and the saturation of your

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.310 
brightness and the saturation of your
file<00:01:08.400> this<00:01:09.400> image<00:01:09.640> gets<00:01:10.270> a<00:01:10.390> little<00:01:10.570> too<00:01:11.020> dark

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
file this image gets a little too dark

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.620 
file this image gets a little too dark
