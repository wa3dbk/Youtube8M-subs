acorns here that I picked up why did I
pick<00:01:27.630> up<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.170> acorn<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.070> there's<00:01:29.280> only

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
pick up the acorn so that there's only

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.289 
pick up the acorn so that there's only
the<00:01:29.850> one<00:01:29.880> in<00:01:30.590> plain<00:01:31.590> view<00:01:31.939> that<00:01:32.939> way<00:01:33.180> it

to find the food they know there were
acorns<00:01:38.790> here<00:01:39.119> but<00:01:39.960> now<00:01:40.140> they<00:01:40.409> need<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.770> find

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
acorns here but now they need to find

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.300 
acorns here but now they need to find
the<00:01:41.579> one<00:01:41.820> acorn<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:42.689> maximized<00:01:43.439> my<00:01:43.710> chances

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
the one acorn so I maximized my chances

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.530 
the one acorn so I maximized my chances
so<00:01:45.060> let's<00:01:45.270> get<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:45.689> set<00:01:46.790> this<00:01:47.790> kind<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.240> snare

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.560 
so let's get this set this kind of snare
isn't<00:01:48.960> necessarily<00:01:49.470> hard<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.100> make<00:01:50.369> but<00:01:51.299> it's

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
isn't necessarily hard to make but it's

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.170 
isn't necessarily hard to make but it's
got<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.840> trigger<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.740> now<00:01:53.700> you're<00:01:53.939> going<00:01:54.119> to

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.340 
this is a yoke for the snare that I've
made<00:02:02.189> by<00:02:02.520> bending<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:03.119> sapling<00:02:03.689> over<00:02:04.140> and

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
made by bending a sapling over and

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.429 
made by bending a sapling over and
pushing<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.310> into<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.640> ground<00:02:06.140> I'm<00:02:07.140> also

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
pushing it into the ground I'm also

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.979 
pushing it into the ground I'm also
going<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:08.009> need<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.520> sapling<00:02:09.179> somewhere<00:02:09.690> nearby

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
going to need a sapling somewhere nearby

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.720 
going to need a sapling somewhere nearby
it's<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.800> little<00:02:11.039> bit<00:02:11.190> bigger<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:12.090> make

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
it's a little bit bigger to make

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:21.080 
it's a little bit bigger to make
my<00:02:13.480> snare<00:02:13.870> spring<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:18.670> this<00:02:18.970> is<00:02:19.239> my<00:02:19.540> spring

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
my snare spring so this is my spring

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.860 
my snare spring so this is my spring
it's<00:02:22.090> a<00:02:22.180> rather<00:02:22.420> large<00:02:24.780> stout<00:02:25.780> sapling<00:02:26.650> and

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
it's a rather large stout sapling and

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:36.449 
it's a rather large stout sapling and
you<00:02:28.870> see<00:02:31.110> that<00:02:32.110> it<00:02:32.260> is<00:02:32.290> rather<00:02:32.650> tall<00:02:35.459> the

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
you see that it is rather tall the

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:42.390 
you see that it is rather tall the
reason<00:02:37.090> that<00:02:37.390> it<00:02:38.140> is<00:02:38.260> rather<00:02:38.530> tall<00:02:41.220> there<00:02:42.220> you

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
reason that it is rather tall there you

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.420 
reason that it is rather tall there you
see<00:02:42.430> my<00:02:42.849> snare<00:02:43.209> wire<00:02:43.739> the<00:02:44.739> reason<00:02:45.160> that<00:02:45.310> it's

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
see my snare wire the reason that it's

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.770 
see my snare wire the reason that it's
tall<00:02:45.819> is<00:02:46.299> so<00:02:47.170> that<00:02:47.349> it<00:02:47.470> has<00:02:47.739> much<00:02:48.340> force<00:02:48.879> and

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.000 

it's<00:02:52.780> high<00:02:53.140> enough<00:02:53.170> off<00:02:53.769> of<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.220> ground<00:02:56.010> so

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
it's high enough off of the ground so

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.960 
it's high enough off of the ground so
that<00:02:57.040> no<00:02:57.519> predator<00:02:58.230> short<00:02:59.230> of<00:02:59.379> a<00:02:59.440> bobcat<00:03:00.040> can

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
that no predator short of a bobcat can

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.130 
that no predator short of a bobcat can
actually<00:03:01.510> get<00:03:01.840> to<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:04.209> squirrel<00:03:04.569> that's<00:03:04.900> been

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
actually get to the squirrel that's been

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:14.720 
actually get to the squirrel that's been
snared<00:03:07.230> we<00:03:08.230> have<00:03:08.500> our<00:03:08.769> snare<00:03:09.129> spring

trigger here and I'm going to take my

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:16.440 
trigger here and I'm going to take my
acorn<00:04:01.170> I'm<00:04:02.170> going<00:04:02.440> to<00:04:02.560> position<00:04:02.829> this<00:04:03.400> here

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.540 

now<00:04:17.110> the<00:04:17.170> Acorn<00:04:18.360> is<00:04:19.360> setting<00:04:20.280> underneath<00:04:21.280> of

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:21.550 
now the Acorn is setting underneath of

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:26.610 
now the Acorn is setting underneath of
my<00:04:22.150> bar<00:04:22.930> here<00:04:23.500> and<00:04:24.060> you<00:04:25.060> see<00:04:25.420> that<00:04:25.630> I<00:04:25.690> have<00:04:25.810> all

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
my bar here and you see that I have all

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.390 
my bar here and you see that I have all
these<00:04:26.950> sticks<00:04:27.400> driven<00:04:27.910> into<00:04:28.060> the<00:04:28.210> ground<00:04:28.270> here

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
these sticks driven into the ground here

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.790 
these sticks driven into the ground here
the<00:04:30.400> reason<00:04:30.850> for<00:04:31.120> that<00:04:31.150> is<00:04:31.750> so<00:04:32.170> that<00:04:32.200> whatever

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
the reason for that is so that whatever

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.610 
the reason for that is so that whatever
squirrel<00:04:33.370> goes<00:04:33.730> for<00:04:34.090> this<00:04:34.240> has<00:04:34.930> to<00:04:35.200> go<00:04:35.380> in

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
squirrel goes for this has to go in

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.380 
squirrel goes for this has to go in

wire that is a fishing leader I'm just
going<00:04:45.970> to<00:04:46.000> bend<00:04:46.450> this<00:04:46.800> here<00:04:48.000> so<00:04:49.000> that<00:04:49.210> will

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
going to bend this here so that will

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:55.970 
going to bend this here so that will
hold<00:04:49.600> itself<00:04:53.580> push<00:04:54.580> this<00:04:54.820> out<00:04:55.060> a<00:04:55.120> little<00:04:55.330> bit

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
hold itself push this out a little bit

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:02.240 
hold itself push this out a little bit
i'm<00:04:56.980> also<00:04:57.250> going<00:04:57.610> to<00:04:57.850> move<00:04:59.040> that<00:05:00.040> around<00:05:00.400> back

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
i'm also going to move that around back

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:08.580 
i'm also going to move that around back
this<00:05:03.250> part<00:05:04.120> right<00:05:04.270> here<00:05:06.000> must<00:05:07.000> be<00:05:07.210> on<00:05:07.750> this

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
this part right here must be on this

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:15.060 
this part right here must be on this
side<00:05:08.980> of<00:05:10.620> the<00:05:11.620> Y<00:05:11.800> stick<00:05:12.220> yoke<00:05:13.950> so<00:05:14.950> how<00:05:15.010> does
