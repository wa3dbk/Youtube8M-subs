and<00:02:44.140> it's<00:02:45.140> supporting<00:02:45.620> also<00:02:45.890> USB<00:02:46.370> on-the-go

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
and it's supporting also USB on-the-go

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.330 
and it's supporting also USB on-the-go
so<00:02:47.120> so<00:02:47.570> when<00:02:47.720> you<00:02:47.810> have<00:02:47.990> this<00:02:48.110> adapter<00:02:48.650> and<00:02:49.040> USB

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
stick you can copy for example your

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.270 
stick you can copy for example your
content<00:02:52.640> here<00:02:52.940> to<00:02:53.510> device<00:02:53.870> back<00:02:54.110> up<00:02:54.290> here<00:02:54.560> and

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
content here to device back up here and

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.150 
content here to device back up here and
things<00:02:55.550> like<00:02:55.730> that<00:02:56.170> and<00:02:57.170> then<00:02:57.770> there<00:02:57.980> is<00:02:58.130> a

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
things like that and then there is a

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.350 
things like that and then there is a
simple<00:02:59.060> a<00:02:59.330> volunteer<00:03:00.140> camera<00:03:00.590> key<00:03:00.950> and<00:03:01.370> energy

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
simple a volunteer camera key and energy

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.250 
simple a volunteer camera key and energy
let's<00:03:03.320> take<00:03:03.530> a<00:03:03.560> picture<00:03:03.920> of<00:03:03.950> you<00:03:04.160> one<00:03:05.260> is

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
let's take a picture of you one is

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.400 
let's take a picture of you one is
always<00:03:06.500> taking<00:03:06.950> each<00:03:07.100> of<00:03:07.280> me

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410
