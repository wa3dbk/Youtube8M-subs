 pages 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.510
 today we are going to make some cookies 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:19.990
 ginger the ingredients that we're going to 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:25.180
 need are margarine wheat flour 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:27.480
 egg honey cane ginger cinnamon salt and 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.480
 nutmeg 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.040
 The first thing we are going to do is put the 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.870
 butter as long as it's 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.380
 room temperature during an average 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:44.559
 time in the blender and we are going to knead it 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.660
 about 23 minutes once it's okay 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.809
 mixed let's add the sugar 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.300
 brown another two or three minutes add 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:55.500
 the egg we are also going to add the 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.500
 cinnamon and nutmeg 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.079
 and let's also add the ginger and 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.079
 the salt 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:09.020
 and we 're going to move everything about 34 minutes 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.750
 and finally we're going to take honey from 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.659
 cane and we're going to beat it about 3 or 4 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.700
 more minutes in the middle of the flour 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.140
 because the other half we're going to leave 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.140
 reserved for kneading 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:27.250
 Now what we have done has been to put 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:31.150
 the dough on a table with a base 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:34.140
 flour let's take some flour 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.640
 and we are going to knead little by little 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.380
 trying to taste the dough because as the 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.050
 you try not to be able to stop you are going to see 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.510
 that the taste is great 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.370
 let's go throwing flour until not 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.910
 it got stuck in our hands because 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:51.170
 go see what a very sticky dough is 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:53.689
 but very easy to work 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.130
 once we have our mass in 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.729
 the one that does not stick with the 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:01.220
 hands let's put paper where 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.659
 let's put it on top and we'll go 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.659
 clarifying with great patience 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.910
 Once we have already kneaded it, we will 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.120
 take the parts of our house and the 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.549
 let's go cutting 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.599
 let's preheat the oven to 180 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:22.379
 degrees and we're going to have our cookies 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:27.269
 or part of our house approximately 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:27.269
 for about 10-12 minutes 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.360
 once we have the whole house the 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.140
 let's put it in the oven 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.800
 approximately 10 minutes 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:40.290
 once we have caught and we have left 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.240
 cool cookie that we have made 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.670
 glasa and real we have put our 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.370
 pastry bag and now with a lot 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.610
 patience we're going to hit all the 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.610
 chunks 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:58.300
 we are going to help with small steps 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.300
 to hold the house 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.300
 it has to be 24 hours 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.909
 without it moving so that they stick 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.060
 all the pieces we are going to put here a 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:13.219
 glass with a little weight we already 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.299
 you can put whatever you have at home and 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:16.299
 here too 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.239
 and we are going to do the same with all the 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.239
 parts of the house 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.040
 now the most fun part is going 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.220
 to catch and we will decorate us in 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.350
 this case we are going to take the house and the 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.110
 we are going to put on the roof and the 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.120
 edges of the house so they are fixed well 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:42.230
 we are going to take it 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:47.200
 based on real plaza that we have 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:50.200
 done and you have to wait 24 hours 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:54.849
 It's been 24 hours and we have our 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:58.450
 finished house with its decoration and 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:04:00.370
 real raft has dried up as you see it 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.660
 very beautiful is an original form 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:07.540
 to eat biscuit and decorate also 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.580
 our house at Christmas and also the 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.380
 Children can help because I assure you 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.489
 that you will love decorating our 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.489
 I hope you like home
