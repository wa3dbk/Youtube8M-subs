to<00:00:10.050> her<00:00:10.230> video<00:00:10.380> this<00:00:11.099> is<00:00:11.250> going<00:00:11.400> to<00:00:11.460> be<00:00:11.550> about

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
to her video this is going to be about

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.249 
to her video this is going to be about
the<00:00:11.820> AFK<00:00:12.059> money-making<00:00:12.690> method<00:00:12.929> i<00:00:12.990> said<00:00:13.170> i<00:00:13.200> was

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
the AFK money-making method i said i was

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.570 
the AFK money-making method i said i was
going<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.500> make<00:00:13.650> let's<00:00:14.130> go<00:00:14.250> ahead<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:14.400> jump

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
going to make let's go ahead and jump

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.090 
going to make let's go ahead and jump
right<00:00:14.700> in<00:00:14.880> this<00:00:15.450> method<00:00:15.690> makes<00:00:15.990> around<00:00:16.260> 2.5<00:00:16.920> to

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
right in this method makes around 2.5 to

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.680 
right in this method makes around 2.5 to
three<00:00:17.279> ml<00:00:17.369> plus<00:00:17.670> per<00:00:17.850> hour<00:00:18.000> depending<00:00:18.270> on<00:00:18.510> your

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
three ml plus per hour depending on your

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.179 
three ml plus per hour depending on your
lucky<00:00:19.020> can<00:00:19.199> make<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.380> bit<00:00:19.560> more<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:19.920> it<00:00:20.039> can

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
lucky can make a bit more and it can

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.920 
lucky can make a bit more and it can
make<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.340> bit<00:00:20.550> less<00:00:20.730> but<00:00:20.760> i<00:00:21.119> did<00:00:21.330> three<00:00:21.570> hours<00:00:21.810> of

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
make a bit less but i did three hours of

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.630 
make a bit less but i did three hours of
testing<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.380> i<00:00:22.470> made<00:00:22.650> around<00:00:22.859> 2.8<00:00:23.400> mil

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
testing and i made around 2.8 mil

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.189 
testing and i made around 2.8 mil
average<00:00:24.060> so<00:00:24.660> that's<00:00:24.810> pretty<00:00:25.019> good<00:00:25.140> right

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
average so that's pretty good right

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.109 
average so that's pretty good right
there<00:00:25.529> now<00:00:26.220> what<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.490> do<00:00:26.730> need<00:00:26.880> for<00:00:27.060> this

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
there now what you do need for this

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.820 
there now what you do need for this
method<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.630> need<00:00:27.810> 81<00:00:28.320> slater<00:00:28.590> that's

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
method is you need 81 slater that's

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.710 
method is you need 81 slater that's
required<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.310> kill<00:00:29.490> these<00:00:29.670> monsters<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.330> you

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
required to kill these monsters and you

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.240 
required to kill these monsters and you
also<00:00:30.840> need<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.140> high<00:00:31.320> range<00:00:31.619> level<00:00:32.009> since<00:00:32.160> you

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
also need a high range level since you

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.680 
also need a high range level since you
need<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.520> kill<00:00:32.640> them<00:00:32.820> with<00:00:32.910> range<00:00:33.149> i<00:00:33.390> would

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
need to kill them with range i would

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.660 
need to kill them with range i would
recommend<00:00:34.170> 85<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:35.070> can<00:00:35.219> into<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.460> desk

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
recommend 85 so you can into the desk

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.830 
recommend 85 so you can into the desk
swiftness<00:00:35.969> ability<00:00:36.390> but<00:00:36.510> that's<00:00:36.690> not

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
swiftness ability but that's not

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.540 
swiftness ability but that's not
required<00:00:37.230> i<00:00:37.410> would<00:00:37.559> probably<00:00:38.190> only<00:00:38.280> say

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
required i would probably only say

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.430 
required i would probably only say
around<00:00:38.760> 80<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.239> needed<00:00:39.570> i<00:00:39.750> wouldn't<00:00:40.290> go<00:00:40.379> too

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
around 80 is needed i wouldn't go too

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.630 
around 80 is needed i wouldn't go too
much<00:00:40.770> lower<00:00:40.980> than<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.280> but<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.489> can

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
much lower than that but you can

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.100 
much lower than that but you can
probably<00:00:41.820> get<00:00:42.090> away<00:00:42.120> with<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.600> but<00:00:42.809> don't<00:00:42.989> go

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
probably get away with it but don't go

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.049 
probably get away with it but don't go
too<00:00:43.140> much<00:00:43.320> lower<00:00:43.649> than<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.980> now<00:00:44.850> what<00:00:44.969> I'm

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
too much lower than that now what I'm

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.279 
too much lower than that now what I'm
going<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.239> be<00:00:45.329> using<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.660> I'm<00:00:46.050> going<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.230> be

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
going to be using is I'm going to be

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.540 
going to be using is I'm going to be
using<00:00:46.350> our<00:00:46.620> middle<00:00:46.860> armor<00:00:47.100> with<00:00:47.219> chaotic

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.670 
using our middle armor with chaotic
crossbows<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.719> can<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.050> course<00:00:49.079> change<00:00:49.559> the

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
crossbows you can of course change the

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.810 
crossbows you can of course change the
gears<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:49.980> like<00:00:50.190> if<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.370> want<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.670> go<00:00:50.760> ahead

gears you like if you want to go ahead

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.310 
gears you like if you want to go ahead
and<00:00:51.000> upgrade<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.449> use<00:00:51.539> pernix<00:00:51.989> or<00:00:52.140> even

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
and upgrade and use pernix or even

and upgrade and use pernix or even
serenity<00:00:52.829> want<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.730> change<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.030> weapon<00:00:54.270> to

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
serenity want to change the weapon to

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.930 
serenity want to change the weapon to
maybe<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.600> row<00:00:54.780> across<00:00:55.020> those<00:00:55.320> area<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:56.489> can<00:00:56.730> go

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
maybe a row across those area you can go

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.729 
maybe a row across those area you can go
a<00:00:56.969> bit<00:00:57.149> lower<00:00:57.360> maybe<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> black<00:00:58.079> salamander

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
a bit lower maybe to a black salamander

00:00:58.739 --> 00:00:59.840 
a bit lower maybe to a black salamander
hand<00:00:58.980> cannon<00:00:59.309> but<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.460> wouldn't<00:00:59.760> really

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
hand cannon but I wouldn't really

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.430 
hand cannon but I wouldn't really
recommend<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.329> too<00:01:00.510> much<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:01.079> course<00:01:01.289> you'll

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
recommend it too much of course you'll

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.020 
recommend it too much of course you'll
be<00:01:01.559> killing<00:01:02.100> less<00:01:02.309> monsters<00:01:02.699> per<00:01:02.820> hour<00:01:02.879> which

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
be killing less monsters per hour which

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.939 
be killing less monsters per hour which
that's<00:01:03.149> less<00:01:03.329> money<00:01:03.359> per<00:01:03.719> hour<00:01:03.840> possibly<00:01:04.140> well

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
that's less money per hour possibly well

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.230 
that's less money per hour possibly well
it's<00:01:05.040> not<00:01:05.129> really<00:01:05.220> how<00:01:05.400> many<00:01:05.640> UK<00:01:05.970> liz<00:01:06.119> just

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
it's not really how many UK liz just

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.820 
it's not really how many UK liz just
depending<00:01:06.659> on<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.930> look<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.500> get<00:01:07.650> with<00:01:07.799> it

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
depending on the look you get with it

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.920 
depending on the look you get with it
drops<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.520> i'm<00:01:08.939> also<00:01:09.060> using<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.360> van<00:01:09.600> prism

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
drops and i'm also using the van prism

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.810 
drops and i'm also using the van prism
or<00:01:10.049> because<00:01:10.470> this<00:01:10.799> or<00:01:11.040> really<00:01:11.460> helps<00:01:11.729> with

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
or because this or really helps with

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:12.950 
or because this or really helps with
this<00:01:12.000> method<00:01:12.180> because<00:01:12.540> then<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.720> don't<00:01:12.750> have

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
this method because then you don't have

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.539 
this method because then you don't have
to<00:01:13.020> bring<00:01:13.110> as<00:01:13.290> much<00:01:13.409> food<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:14.250> you<00:01:14.340> have<00:01:14.460> to

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
to bring as much food and you have to

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.920 
to bring as much food and you have to
worry<00:01:14.640> about<00:01:14.729> eating<00:01:15.119> if<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.330> do<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.659> vampers

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
worry about eating if you do the vampers

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.050 
worry about eating if you do the vampers
more<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.229> makes<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.590> lot<00:01:16.710> more<00:01:16.770> AFK<00:01:17.369> or<00:01:17.549> you

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
more it makes it a lot more AFK or you

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.550 
more it makes it a lot more AFK or you
can<00:01:18.240> replace<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.780> van<00:01:18.930> prism<00:01:19.200> or<00:01:19.290> with<00:01:19.470> the

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
can replace the van prism or with the

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.200 
can replace the van prism or with the

it's the exact same thing but i just

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.580 
it's the exact same thing but i just
prefer<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.130> van<00:01:23.280> prism<00:01:23.610> or<00:01:23.700> up<00:01:24.290> but<00:01:25.290> i<00:01:25.320> bet<00:01:25.470> you

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
and it is going to be the essential

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.719 
and it is going to be the essential
digit<00:01:28.320> since<00:01:28.500> i<00:01:28.619> did<00:01:28.799> say<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.040> need<00:01:29.280> range<00:01:29.549> in

with momentum but that's a very

that's<00:02:28.380> what<00:02:28.590> makes<00:02:28.770> it<00:02:28.890> this<00:02:29.040> method<00:02:29.340> AFK<00:02:29.700> so

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
that's what makes it this method AFK so

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.010 
that's what makes it this method AFK so
you<00:02:29.880> know<00:02:29.970> constantly<00:02:30.330> spun<00:02:30.570> taking<00:02:30.870> loop

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
you know constantly spun taking loop

what<00:02:39.120> this<00:02:39.270> does<00:02:39.330> is<00:02:39.720> that<00:02:39.870> will<00:02:40.020> use<00:02:40.170> the

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
what this does is that will use the

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.590 
what this does is that will use the
first<00:02:40.560> eight<00:02:40.940> abilities<00:02:41.940> on<00:02:42.030> your<00:02:42.150> action<00:02:42.450> bar

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
first eight abilities on your action bar

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.270 
first eight abilities on your action bar
in<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.930> order<00:02:43.230> of<00:02:43.410> when<00:02:43.620> they're<00:02:43.770> uncool<00:02:44.100> down

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
in the order of when they're uncool down

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.490 
in the order of when they're uncool down
so<00:02:44.880> what<00:02:45.060> I<00:02:45.090> do<00:02:45.209> is<00:02:45.330> I<00:02:45.540> have<00:02:45.660> sacrificed<00:02:45.900> first

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
so what I do is I have sacrificed first

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.810 
so what I do is I have sacrificed first
because<00:02:46.770> that<00:02:46.920> means<00:02:47.010> whenever<00:02:47.220> sacrifice

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
because that means whenever sacrifice

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.030 
because that means whenever sacrifice
goes<00:02:48.090> on<00:02:48.270> cooldown<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.720> will<00:02:48.840> use<00:02:48.989> it<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:49.890> this

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
goes on cooldown it will use it and this

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.350 
goes on cooldown it will use it and this
helps<00:02:50.310> a<00:02:50.370> lot<00:02:50.459> of<00:02:50.550> putting<00:02:50.760> it<00:02:50.850> first<00:02:51.090> on<00:02:51.209> your

your<00:04:27.780> item<00:04:28.080> and<00:04:28.290> that's<00:04:28.650> what<00:04:28.800> makes<00:04:28.950> us<00:04:29.040> AF<00:04:29.370> K

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
your item and that's what makes us AF K

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.550 
your item and that's what makes us AF K
so<00:04:29.670> that's<00:04:30.000> definitely<00:04:30.240> really<00:04:30.750> good<00:04:30.900> and<00:04:31.110> as

so that's definitely really good and as
you<00:04:31.680> can<00:04:31.800> see<00:04:31.830> revolutions<00:04:32.520> is<00:04:32.640> using<00:04:32.880> my

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
you can see revolutions is using my

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.490 
you can see revolutions is using my
basic<00:04:33.330> abilities<00:04:33.660> in<00:04:33.780> order<00:04:34.020> so<00:04:34.140> i<00:04:34.200> don't<00:04:34.440> have

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
basic abilities in order so i don't have

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.810 
basic abilities in order so i don't have
to<00:04:34.620> click<00:04:34.860> on<00:04:34.980> the<00:04:35.070> screen<00:04:35.310> and<00:04:35.460> click<00:04:35.610> on<00:04:35.730> the

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
monsters and auto rotella t keeps it so

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.650 
monsters and auto rotella t keeps it so
i<00:04:38.370> keep<00:04:38.550> attacking<00:04:38.850> them<00:04:39.090> so<00:04:39.210> whenever<00:04:39.450> one

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
i keep attacking them so whenever one

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:40.760

dies<00:04:39.840> they<00:04:40.020> don't<00:04:40.140> have<00:04:40.230> to<00:04:40.350> attack<00:04:40.590> another

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.470 
dies they don't have to attack another
one<00:04:41.130> so<00:04:41.790> that's<00:04:41.910> what's<00:04:42.090> really<00:04:42.210> good<00:04:42.450> about

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
one so that's what's really good about

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.720 
one so that's what's really good about
this<00:04:42.720> method<00:04:43.140> it's<00:04:43.560> a<00:04:43.860> FK<00:04:44.250> you<00:04:44.310> can<00:04:44.580> make<00:04:44.700> a

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
this method it's a FK you can make a

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.030 
this method it's a FK you can make a
bunch<00:04:45.030> of<00:04:45.150> money<00:04:45.210> again<00:04:45.720> I<00:04:45.750> average<00:04:46.200> 2.8<00:04:46.830> mil

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
bunch of money again I average 2.8 mil

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.040 
bunch of money again I average 2.8 mil
per<00:04:47.250> hour<00:04:47.430> here<00:04:47.760> after<00:04:48.120> I<00:04:48.180> did<00:04:48.360> three<00:04:48.660> hours<00:04:48.930> of

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
per hour here after I did three hours of

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.990 
per hour here after I did three hours of
testing<00:04:49.410> I<00:04:49.500> average<00:04:49.740> 2.8<00:04:50.220> mil<00:04:50.400> when<00:04:50.940> I

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
testing I average 2.8 mil when I

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.280 
testing I average 2.8 mil when I
averaged<00:04:51.330> all<00:04:51.450> three<00:04:51.690> and<00:04:51.780> my<00:04:51.840> times<00:04:52.050> together

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
averaged all three and my times together

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.170 
averaged all three and my times together
so<00:04:52.980> you<00:04:53.070> might<00:04:53.250> get<00:04:53.370> some<00:04:53.430> times<00:04:53.850> or<00:04:54.030> maybe

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
so you might get some times or maybe

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.850 
so you might get some times or maybe
only<00:04:54.420> make<00:04:54.630> one<00:04:54.900> to<00:04:54.990> two-month<00:04:55.290> then<00:04:55.770> you

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
only make one to two-month then you

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.590 
only make one to two-month then you
might<00:04:56.010> get<00:04:56.160> x<00:04:56.340> remake<00:04:56.670> maybe<00:04:56.880> 5<00:04:57.120> mil<00:04:57.390> an<00:04:57.480> hour

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
might get x remake maybe 5 mil an hour

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.420 
might get x remake maybe 5 mil an hour
it<00:04:58.080> all<00:04:58.200> depends<00:04:58.560> on<00:04:58.620> luck<00:04:58.830> but<00:04:59.100> most<00:04:59.250> of<00:04:59.370> my

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
it all depends on luck but most of my

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.950 
it all depends on luck but most of my
times<00:04:59.670> were<00:04:59.850> around<00:05:00.060> two<00:05:00.330> to<00:05:00.480> three<00:05:00.660> ml<00:05:00.750> per

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
times were around two to three ml per

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.690 
times were around two to three ml per
hour<00:05:01.110> so<00:05:01.320> it<00:05:01.380> averages<00:05:01.830> around<00:05:01.950> there<00:05:02.250> I<00:05:02.430> know

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
hour so it averages around there I know

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.340 
hour so it averages around there I know
some<00:05:02.940> people<00:05:03.000> get<00:05:03.360> like<00:05:03.450> big<00:05:03.720> luck<00:05:03.960> streak<00:05:04.200> so

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
some people get like big luck streak so

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.010 
some people get like big luck streak so
they<00:05:04.470> get<00:05:04.590> like<00:05:04.710> maybe<00:05:04.950> 10<00:05:05.580> or<00:05:05.610> 11<00:05:06.090> keys<00:05:06.330> I<00:05:06.600> was

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
they get like maybe 10 or 11 keys I was

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.360 
they get like maybe 10 or 11 keys I was
I<00:05:07.350> didn't<00:05:07.590> really<00:05:07.740> count<00:05:07.830> how<00:05:07.950> many<00:05:08.040> kids<00:05:08.250> does

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
I didn't really count how many kids does

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.530 
I didn't really count how many kids does
everything<00:05:08.640> i<00:05:08.790> think<00:05:08.970> was<00:05:09.060> around<00:05:09.240> like<00:05:09.360> five

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
everything i think was around like five

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.900 
everything i think was around like five
or<00:05:09.750> six<00:05:09.870> keys<00:05:10.170> okay<00:05:11.100> guys<00:05:11.250> so<00:05:11.460> I'm<00:05:11.550> already<00:05:11.790> on

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
or six keys okay guys so I'm already on

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.430 
or six keys okay guys so I'm already on
my<00:05:12.000> second<00:05:12.420> overload<00:05:12.810> dose<00:05:13.020> and<00:05:13.170> I<00:05:13.230> already

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
my second overload dose and I already

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.810 
my second overload dose and I already
have<00:05:13.650> a<00:05:13.680> second<00:05:14.070> key<00:05:14.220> so<00:05:14.400> it<00:05:14.460> looks<00:05:14.580> like<00:05:14.610> my

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
have a second key so it looks like my

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.250 
have a second key so it looks like my
looks<00:05:15.030> doing<00:05:15.270> pretty<00:05:15.450> good<00:05:15.630> here<00:05:15.840> this<00:05:16.020> trip

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
looks doing pretty good here this trip

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.020 
looks doing pretty good here this trip
but<00:05:16.680> I'm<00:05:16.800> also<00:05:16.950> going<00:05:17.130> to<00:05:17.190> talk<00:05:17.370> about<00:05:17.460> the<00:05:17.640> EXP

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
but I'm also going to talk about the EXP

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.450 
but I'm also going to talk about the EXP
reads<00:05:18.270> you<00:05:18.330> can<00:05:18.480> get<00:05:18.600> here<00:05:18.810> at<00:05:19.200> 99<00:05:19.770> range<00:05:19.980> I<00:05:20.280> got

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
reads you can get here at 99 range I got

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.300 
reads you can get here at 99 range I got
180<00:05:21.180> k<00:05:21.420> range<00:05:21.690> exp<00:05:22.200> per<00:05:22.320> hour<00:05:22.500> now<00:05:23.010> you<00:05:23.070> can

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
180 k range exp per hour now you can

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.220 
180 k range exp per hour now you can
also<00:05:23.430> set<00:05:23.730> that<00:05:23.880> to<00:05:24.030> defense<00:05:24.420> exp<00:05:24.870> if<00:05:24.960> you<00:05:25.050> said

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230 
also set that to defense exp if you said

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:26.960 
also set that to defense exp if you said
your<00:05:25.380> calculator<00:05:25.920> turn<00:05:26.160> on<00:05:26.280> defense<00:05:26.670> XP

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
your calculator turn on defense XP

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.730 
your calculator turn on defense XP
instead<00:05:27.270> of<00:05:27.390> range<00:05:27.570> or<00:05:27.780> you<00:05:28.200> can<00:05:28.320> do<00:05:28.440> both<00:05:28.590> at

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
instead of range or you can do both at

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.620 
instead of range or you can do both at
the<00:05:28.770> same<00:05:28.830> time<00:05:29.040> you<00:05:29.400> can<00:05:29.520> get<00:05:29.640> 90<00:05:29.940> k<00:05:30.090> range<00:05:30.360> and

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
the same time you can get 90 k range and

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.960 
the same time you can get 90 k range and
defense<00:05:30.960> exp<00:05:31.350> per<00:05:31.470> hour<00:05:31.620> and<00:05:31.920> I<00:05:32.400> also<00:05:32.520> averaged

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
defense exp per hour and I also averaged

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.500 
defense exp per hour and I also averaged

60 k Constitution XP per hour at 99 you

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.330 
60 k Constitution XP per hour at 99 you
also<00:05:36.930> lose<00:05:37.140> seven<00:05:37.560> percent<00:05:37.890> charge<00:05:38.130> on<00:05:38.310> your

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
also lose seven percent charge on your

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.520 
also lose seven percent charge on your
chaotic<00:05:38.730> Ross<00:05:39.000> was<00:05:39.180> of<00:05:39.360> use<00:05:39.510> those<00:05:39.780> each<00:05:40.230> hour

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
chaotic Ross was of use those each hour

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.260 
chaotic Ross was of use those each hour
I<00:05:40.830> don't<00:05:41.250> know<00:05:41.340> if<00:05:41.430> it's<00:05:41.520> the<00:05:41.610> same<00:05:41.850> for<00:05:42.060> roll

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
I don't know if it's the same for roll

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.610 
I don't know if it's the same for roll
across<00:05:42.480> why<00:05:42.720> because<00:05:42.960> that's<00:05:43.110> a<00:05:43.169> two-handed

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
across why because that's a two-handed

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.409 
across why because that's a two-handed
weapon<00:05:43.980> maybe<00:05:44.160> it'll<00:05:44.400> only<00:05:44.520> do<00:05:44.850> half<00:05:45.120> of<00:05:45.270> that

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:45.419 
weapon maybe it'll only do half of that

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:47.120 
weapon maybe it'll only do half of that
since<00:05:45.660> Tony<00:05:45.900> firing<00:05:46.290> one<00:05:46.500> at<00:05:46.590> a<00:05:46.650> time<00:05:46.890> I

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
since Tony firing one at a time I

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.860 
since Tony firing one at a time I
haven't<00:05:47.760> tested<00:05:47.910> that<00:05:48.120> yet<00:05:48.240> maybe<00:05:48.510> I<00:05:48.630> should

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
haven't tested that yet maybe I should

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.780 
haven't tested that yet maybe I should
have<00:05:48.960> but<00:05:49.169> oh<00:05:49.350> well<00:05:49.680> you<00:05:49.950> lose<00:05:50.310> around<00:05:50.460> seven

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:50.790 
have but oh well you lose around seven

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:51.950 
have but oh well you lose around seven
percent<00:05:50.880> when<00:05:51.150> your<00:05:51.270> dual<00:05:51.419> wielding<00:05:51.780> the

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
percent when your dual wielding the

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.150 
percent when your dual wielding the
degrading<00:05:52.500> weapons<00:05:52.800> so<00:05:52.890> I<00:05:52.950> would<00:05:53.100> assume

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 
degrading weapons so I would assume

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.920 
degrading weapons so I would assume
that's<00:05:53.400> for<00:05:53.550> extensions<00:05:53.970> too<00:05:54.150> they<00:05:54.720> probably

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
that's for extensions too they probably

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.960 
that's for extensions too they probably
degree<00:05:55.230> at<00:05:55.320> the<00:05:55.350> same<00:05:55.530> speed<00:05:55.830> so<00:05:56.669> yeah<00:05:56.790> this

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
degree at the same speed so yeah this

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.550 
degree at the same speed so yeah this
method<00:05:57.330> is<00:05:57.419> a<00:05:57.450> really<00:05:57.780> good<00:05:57.930> method<00:05:58.260> I<00:05:58.320> love

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
method is a really good method I love

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.230 
method is a really good method I love
doing<00:05:58.770> it<00:05:59.010> it<00:05:59.130> makes<00:05:59.310> around<00:05:59.550> three<00:05:59.880> mil<00:06:00.090> per

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
doing it it makes around three mil per

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.900 
doing it it makes around three mil per
hour<00:06:00.390> it's<00:06:00.750> AFK<00:06:01.380> it's<00:06:01.860> barely<00:06:02.130> any<00:06:02.430> work<00:06:02.700> and

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:02.910 
hour it's AFK it's barely any work and

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:04.760 
hour it's AFK it's barely any work and
it's<00:06:03.060> just<00:06:03.210> great<00:06:03.540> so<00:06:04.200> yeah<00:06:04.320> I<00:06:04.350> hope<00:06:04.380> you<00:06:04.620> guys
