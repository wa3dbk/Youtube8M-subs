00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.259 
here the token module to listen to Bob
right<00:02:10.869> here<00:02:11.050> that<00:02:11.230> half<00:02:11.410> a<00:02:11.650> thing<00:02:12.269> unless

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
right here that half a thing unless

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.170 
right here that half a thing unless
spring<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:15.010> spring<00:02:15.160> needs<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:15.850> be<00:02:16.000> hooked

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
spring the spring needs to be hooked

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.280 
spring the spring needs to be hooked
right<00:02:16.660> here<00:02:17.079> and<00:02:17.850> this<00:02:18.850> has<00:02:19.510> constant<00:02:20.079> tension

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
right here and this has constant tension

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.230 
right here and this has constant tension
on<00:02:20.530> it<00:02:20.590> but<00:02:21.510> they<00:02:22.510> made<00:02:22.720> it<00:02:22.870> too<00:02:22.989> thin

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
on it but they made it too thin

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.620 
on it but they made it too thin
and<00:02:24.500> faster<00:02:25.500> fractures<00:02:25.980> over<00:02:26.310> time<00:02:26.520> so<00:02:27.360> the

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
and faster fractures over time so the

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.600 
and faster fractures over time so the
constant<00:02:28.110> tension<00:02:28.260> on<00:02:28.560> it<00:02:28.590> it<00:02:29.100> just<00:02:29.310> snapped

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
constant tension on it it just snapped

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.660 
constant tension on it it just snapped

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
have two more right here underneath at

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.150 
have two more right here underneath at
pad<00:02:49.850> right<00:02:50.850> there<00:02:51.380> let<00:02:52.380> it<00:02:52.410> flip<00:02:52.560> those<00:02:52.800> up<00:02:53.010> and

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
pad right there let it flip those up and

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.960 
pad right there let it flip those up and
better<00:02:53.340> for<00:02:54.330> this<00:02:54.540> up<00:02:54.810> and<00:02:55.050> slide<00:02:55.320> it<00:02:55.470> back<00:02:55.970> so
