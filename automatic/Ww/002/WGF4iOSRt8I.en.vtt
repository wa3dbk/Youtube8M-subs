00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.279 
foremost the tire and the track
interaction<00:00:53.610> what's<00:00:54.210> really<00:00:54.629> going<00:00:54.870> on<00:00:55.020> there

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
interaction what's really going on there

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.470 
interaction what's really going on there
it<00:00:55.829> would<00:00:55.949> be<00:00:56.070> easy<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.610> just<00:00:56.940> quickly<00:00:57.180> throw

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
it would be easy to just quickly throw

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.389 
it would be easy to just quickly throw
something<00:00:57.840> together<00:00:57.930> our<00:00:58.440> standards<00:00:58.949> are<00:00:59.129> it

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
something together our standards are it

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.689 
something together our standards are it
needs<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.969> make<00:01:00.359> sense<00:01:01.160> what's<00:01:02.160> really<00:01:02.460> going

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
needs to make sense what's really going

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.609 
needs to make sense what's really going
on<00:01:02.879> even<00:01:03.300> at<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.539> molecular<00:01:03.899> level<00:01:04.170> between

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
on even at the molecular level between

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.039 
on even at the molecular level between
the<00:01:04.799> track<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.369> tire<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:06.299> way<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.659> track

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
the track and the tire the way the track

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.830 
the track and the tire the way the track
works<00:01:07.439> essentially<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.460> we<00:01:09.299> divide<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.750> up

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
works essentially is we divide it up

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.789 
works essentially is we divide it up
into<00:01:10.049> small<00:01:10.580> cells<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:12.540> your<00:01:13.140> car<00:01:13.380> interacts

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
into small cells that your car interacts

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.980 
into small cells that your car interacts
with<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.610> if<00:01:14.850> you're<00:01:15.030> adding<00:01:15.360> temperature<00:01:15.810> to

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
with so if you're adding temperature to

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.660 
with so if you're adding temperature to
a<00:01:16.020> certain<00:01:16.320> part<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.619> track<00:01:16.890> we<00:01:17.549> can

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
a certain part of the track we can

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.609 
a certain part of the track we can
pretty<00:01:17.820> accurately<00:01:17.930> know<00:01:18.930> exactly<00:01:19.409> where

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
pretty accurately know exactly where

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.770 
pretty accurately know exactly where
that<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.790> gets<00:01:21.000> transmitted<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.600> the

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
that is that gets transmitted to the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.590 
that is that gets transmitted to the
server<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.710> if<00:01:23.040> I'm<00:01:23.220> in<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.369> race<00:01:23.580> my<00:01:24.060> data<00:01:24.479> is

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
server so if I'm in a race my data is

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.480 
server so if I'm in a race my data is
going<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.049> server<00:01:25.290> with<00:01:25.890> everybody<00:01:26.250> else

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
going to the server with everybody else

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.940 
going to the server with everybody else
in<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:27.119> session<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.930> server<00:01:28.290> accumulates

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
in the session the server accumulates

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.190 
in the session the server accumulates
that<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.520> basically<00:01:30.119> broadcasts<00:01:31.049> a

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
that and basically broadcasts a

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.050 
that and basically broadcasts a
consistent<00:01:31.979> track<00:01:32.130> state<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.520> everyone<00:01:32.939> so

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
consistent track state to everyone so

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.240 
consistent track state to everyone so
everyone's<00:01:33.360> got<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.720> same<00:01:33.860> track<00:01:34.860> at<00:01:35.100> the

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
everyone's got the same track at the

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.039 
everyone's got the same track at the
racing<00:01:35.610> line<00:01:35.640> one<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.360> big<00:01:36.509> challenges

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
racing line one of the big challenges

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.789 
racing line one of the big challenges
was<00:01:37.619> being<00:01:38.159> able<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.490> implement<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:39.799> dynamic

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
was being able to implement this dynamic

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.310 
was being able to implement this dynamic
track<00:01:41.460> with<00:01:41.939> any<00:01:42.299> number<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.750> clients

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
track with any number of clients

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.550 
track with any number of clients
connected

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
connected

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.890 
connected
and<00:01:44.740> have<00:01:45.159> it<00:01:45.310> just<00:01:45.549> work<00:01:45.909> as<00:01:46.180> you<00:01:46.750> would

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
and have it just work as you would

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.680 
and have it just work as you would
expect<00:01:46.979> have<00:01:47.979> it<00:01:48.159> be<00:01:48.580> the<00:01:48.790> same<00:01:48.970> for<00:01:49.299> everyone

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
expect have it be the same for everyone

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:55.640 
expect have it be the same for everyone
in<00:01:49.810> the<00:01:49.900> service<00:01:50.140> who<00:01:50.500> is<00:01:50.619> in<00:01:50.799> a<00:01:51.010> session

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.010 

so<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.730> kind<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:56.970> give<00:01:57.120> a<00:01:57.150> little<00:01:57.450> bit<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.960> a

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
so to kind of give a little bit of a

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.220 
so to kind of give a little bit of a
preview<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:59.000> state<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.120> things<00:02:00.360> right<00:02:00.780> now<00:02:00.960> I

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.230 
preview of state of things right now I

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.420 
preview of state of things right now I
basically<00:02:02.130> have<00:02:02.790> run<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.810> number<00:02:04.800> of<00:02:04.890> laps<00:02:05.130> at

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
basically have run a number of laps at

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.140 
basically have run a number of laps at
five<00:02:05.640> flags<00:02:06.030> with<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.840> effects<00:02:08.150> exaggerated

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.540 
five flags with the effects exaggerated
for<00:02:09.560> demonstration<00:02:10.560> purposes<00:02:11.070> so<00:02:11.280> that<00:02:11.460> we

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
for demonstration purposes so that we

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.610 
for demonstration purposes so that we
can<00:02:11.700> kind<00:02:11.820> of<00:02:11.910> immediately<00:02:12.510> see<00:02:12.750> what's<00:02:13.350> going

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
can kind of immediately see what's going

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.400 
can kind of immediately see what's going
on<00:02:13.770> with<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.070> track<00:02:14.310> right<00:02:15.240> here<00:02:15.480> is

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
on with the track right here is

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.710 
on with the track right here is
basically<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.430> track<00:02:17.760> at<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.150> beginning<00:02:18.510> of

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
basically the track at the beginning of

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.470 
basically the track at the beginning of
the<00:02:19.110> session<00:02:19.850> there<00:02:20.850> is<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.030> little<00:02:21.270> bit<00:02:21.390> of

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
the session there is a little bit of

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.320 
the session there is a little bit of
rubber<00:02:21.690> on<00:02:21.930> there<00:02:22.200> that's<00:02:22.560> put

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
rubber on there that's put

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.460 
rubber on there that's put
programmatically<00:02:24.330> that's<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:25.020> starting

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
programmatically that's the starting

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.260 
programmatically that's the starting
state<00:02:25.680> of<00:02:25.830> this<00:02:25.920> track<00:02:26.220> and<00:02:26.400> it's<00:02:26.520> fairly<00:02:27.000> low

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
state of this track and it's fairly low

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.420 
state of this track and it's fairly low
rubber<00:02:27.570> at<00:02:27.720> this<00:02:27.840> point<00:02:28.110> if<00:02:28.410> we<00:02:28.860> skip<00:02:29.130> ahead<00:02:29.250> to

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
rubber at this point if we skip ahead to

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.910 
rubber at this point if we skip ahead to
the<00:02:29.640> end<00:02:29.670> I<00:02:30.210> did<00:02:30.720> about<00:02:30.900> 30<00:02:31.140> laps<00:02:31.350> so<00:02:31.740> at<00:02:31.830> the

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
the end I did about 30 laps so at the

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.490 
the end I did about 30 laps so at the
very<00:02:31.980> end<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:32.790> can<00:02:32.940> kind<00:02:33.150> of<00:02:33.210> see<00:02:33.480> all<00:02:34.170> this

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
very end you can kind of see all this

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.410 
very end you can kind of see all this
darkened<00:02:34.950> in<00:02:35.100> right<00:02:35.340> here<00:02:35.610> this<00:02:36.030> is<00:02:36.180> where<00:02:36.390> I

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
darkened in right here this is where I

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.340 
darkened in right here this is where I
was<00:02:36.720> running<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.950> car<00:02:38.190> so<00:02:38.870> there<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:39.990> go<00:02:40.140> and

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
was running the car so there you go and

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.860 
was running the car so there you go and
again<00:02:41.070> this<00:02:41.250> is<00:02:41.400> exaggerated<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.240> single<00:02:42.660> car

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
again this is exaggerated a single car

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.750 
again this is exaggerated a single car
in<00:02:42.900> 30<00:02:43.350> laps<00:02:43.560> isn't<00:02:43.920> not<00:02:44.130> going<00:02:44.250> to<00:02:44.370> darken<00:02:44.550> the

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
in 30 laps isn't not going to darken the

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.810 
in 30 laps isn't not going to darken the
track<00:02:45.030> anywhere<00:02:45.750> near<00:02:45.960> this<00:02:46.140> level<00:02:46.580> we<00:02:47.580> also

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
track anywhere near this level we also

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.390 
track anywhere near this level we also
have<00:02:48.600> the<00:02:49.050> ability<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:49.470> see<00:02:49.740> the<00:02:49.860> temperature

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
have the ability to see the temperature

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.330 
have the ability to see the temperature
similar<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.300> an<00:02:51.420> IR<00:02:51.780> camera<00:02:51.890> at<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:52.980> beginning

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
similar to an IR camera at the beginning

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.190 
similar to an IR camera at the beginning
of<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.490> session<00:02:53.700> it's<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.600> little<00:02:54.870> bit<00:02:54.990> warm

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
of the session it's a little bit warm

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.750 
of the session it's a little bit warm
down<00:02:55.380> here<00:02:55.740> it's<00:02:55.890> very<00:02:55.950> cool<00:02:56.370> up<00:02:56.640> here<00:02:56.670> as<00:02:57.590> we

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
down here it's very cool up here as we

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.390 
down here it's very cool up here as we
skip<00:02:59.760> ahead<00:03:00.320> all<00:03:01.320> of<00:03:01.530> a<00:03:01.560> sudden<00:03:01.890> this<00:03:02.040> part<00:03:02.340> of

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
skip ahead all of a sudden this part of

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.430 
skip ahead all of a sudden this part of
the<00:03:02.489> track<00:03:02.730> has<00:03:03.270> become<00:03:03.510> very<00:03:03.750> warm<00:03:04.140> this<00:03:04.380> is

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
the track has become very warm this is

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.270 
the track has become very warm this is
where<00:03:05.010> I<00:03:05.040> was<00:03:05.340> running<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.420> car<00:03:06.630> and<00:03:07.130> we<00:03:08.130> can

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
where I was running the car and we can

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.880 
where I was running the car and we can
also<00:03:08.600> drag<00:03:09.600> the<00:03:09.630> little<00:03:09.959> thumbnail<00:03:10.320> and<00:03:10.590> see

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
also drag the little thumbnail and see

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.479 
also drag the little thumbnail and see
the<00:03:11.430> effect<00:03:11.820> of<00:03:11.970> time<00:03:12.270> as<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:14.010> track<00:03:14.220> cools

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
the effect of time as the track cools

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.270 
the effect of time as the track cools
off<00:03:14.730> and<00:03:15.350> returns<00:03:16.350> back<00:03:16.500> to<00:03:16.950> its<00:03:17.100> equilibrium

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
off and returns back to its equilibrium

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.020 
off and returns back to its equilibrium
state<00:03:18.200> before<00:03:19.200> we<00:03:19.650> had<00:03:19.830> fairly<00:03:20.310> symmetrical

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
state before we had fairly symmetrical

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.570 
state before we had fairly symmetrical
tracks<00:03:21.390> now<00:03:21.780> because<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:22.560> sun<00:03:22.830> is<00:03:22.860> shining<00:03:23.280> at

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
tracks now because the sun is shining at

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.880 
tracks now because the sun is shining at
some<00:03:23.790> angle<00:03:24.000> one<00:03:24.870> side<00:03:25.200> of<00:03:25.350> the<00:03:25.410> track<00:03:25.620> might

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
some angle one side of the track might

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.430 
some angle one side of the track might
be<00:03:26.070> particularly<00:03:26.730> hot<00:03:26.940> and<00:03:27.209> 180<00:03:28.080> degrees

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
be particularly hot and 180 degrees

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.600 
be particularly hot and 180 degrees
around<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.770> track<00:03:29.040> is<00:03:29.310> going<00:03:29.489> to<00:03:29.550> be

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
around the track is going to be

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:30.979 
around the track is going to be
significantly<00:03:30.060> cooler<00:03:30.239> because<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:30.780> Sun

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
significantly cooler because the Sun

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.110 
significantly cooler because the Sun
isn't<00:03:31.230> really<00:03:31.800> pointing<00:03:32.190> at<00:03:32.280> that<00:03:32.459> so<00:03:32.820> you're

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
isn't really pointing at that so you're

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.030 
isn't really pointing at that so you're
on<00:03:33.450> a<00:03:33.510> track<00:03:33.900> where<00:03:34.080> maybe<00:03:34.290> you<00:03:34.560> basically

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
on a track where maybe you basically

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.160 
on a track where maybe you basically
treated<00:03:35.550> it<00:03:35.670> as<00:03:35.790> two<00:03:36.090> equal<00:03:36.690> halves

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
treated it as two equal halves

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.070 
treated it as two equal halves
now<00:03:37.830> you<00:03:38.370> need<00:03:38.640> to<00:03:38.790> adjust<00:03:39.030> to<00:03:39.420> that<00:03:39.570> with

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
now you need to adjust to that with

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.470 
now you need to adjust to that with
multiple<00:03:40.290> cars<00:03:40.739> over<00:03:41.370> a<00:03:41.400> long<00:03:41.700> race<00:03:42.000> you're

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
multiple cars over a long race you're

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.750 
multiple cars over a long race you're
going<00:03:42.600> to<00:03:42.660> have<00:03:42.870> to<00:03:43.050> seek<00:03:43.769> out<00:03:43.950> where's<00:03:44.459> the

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
going to have to seek out where's the

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.699 
going to have to seek out where's the
grip<00:03:45.000> where<00:03:45.480> is<00:03:45.600> it<00:03:45.720> going<00:03:45.900> how<00:03:46.170> is<00:03:46.320> the<00:03:46.470> track

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
grip where is it going how is the track

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.310 
grip where is it going how is the track
changing<00:03:47.280> it's<00:03:48.239> going<00:03:48.390> to<00:03:48.450> require<00:03:48.660> a<00:03:49.050> much

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
changing it's going to require a much

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.490 
changing it's going to require a much
more<00:03:49.730> intelligent<00:03:50.730> approach<00:03:51.420> to<00:03:52.080> racing

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
more intelligent approach to racing

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.720 
more intelligent approach to racing
you're<00:03:52.980> going<00:03:53.130> to<00:03:53.190> have<00:03:53.280> to<00:03:53.370> be<00:03:53.489> able<00:03:53.610> to

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
you're going to have to be able to

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.640 
you're going to have to be able to
handle<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:54.420> track<00:03:54.690> through<00:03:55.050> the<00:03:55.080> life<00:03:55.350> of<00:03:55.560> the

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
handle the track through the life of the

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.000 
handle the track through the life of the
race<00:03:55.830> so<00:03:56.209> in<00:03:57.209> addition<00:03:57.420> to<00:03:57.810> temperature<00:03:58.739> and

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
race so in addition to temperature and

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.150 
race so in addition to temperature and
rubber<00:03:59.580> we're<00:03:59.910> also<00:04:00.200> spending<00:04:01.200> a<00:04:01.260> lot<00:04:01.380> of<00:04:01.410> time

race<00:04:06.870> you<00:04:07.290> can<00:04:07.560> expect<00:04:08.040> there<00:04:08.220> to<00:04:08.250> be<00:04:08.340> marbles

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
race you can expect there to be marbles

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.540 
race you can expect there to be marbles
off<00:04:09.120> line<00:04:09.420> and<00:04:09.660> so<00:04:10.080> a<00:04:10.110> pass<00:04:10.740> might<00:04:11.070> be<00:04:11.220> a<00:04:11.250> little

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
off line and so a pass might be a little

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.160 
off line and so a pass might be a little
more<00:04:11.850> sketchy<00:04:12.120> later<00:04:12.480> in<00:04:12.660> the<00:04:12.750> race<00:04:12.930> because

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
more sketchy later in the race because

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.870 
more sketchy later in the race because
you're<00:04:13.380> going<00:04:13.500> to<00:04:13.560> have<00:04:13.650> to<00:04:13.740> go<00:04:13.860> through<00:04:13.890> part

rubber on the oval side if you want to

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.280 
rubber on the oval side if you want to

means that during a race temperature's

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.580 
means that during a race temperature's
