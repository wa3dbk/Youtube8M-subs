way<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.280> record<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.880> way<00:01:09.000> that's

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
way that I record is the way that's

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.240 
way that I record is the way that's
going<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.510> be<00:01:09.630> up<00:01:09.780> on<00:01:09.900> youtube<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:10.860> that's<00:01:11.130> what

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
going to be up on youtube so that's what

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.420 
going to be up on youtube so that's what
the<00:01:11.340> light<00:01:11.520> does<00:01:12.320> I'm<00:01:13.320> not<00:01:13.500> sure<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.680> made<00:01:14.310> it

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
the light does I'm not sure that made it

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.370 
the light does I'm not sure that made it
any<00:01:14.580> better<00:01:16.130> but<00:01:17.130> i'll<00:01:17.490> leave<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.820> on<00:01:17.939> for<00:01:18.380> the

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
any better but i'll leave it on for the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.170 
any better but i'll leave it on for the
remainder<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.979> video<00:01:20.220> towards<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.000> end<00:01:21.030> i

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
remainder of the video towards the end i

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.420 
remainder of the video towards the end i
guess<00:01:21.420> i'll<00:01:21.570> turn<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:21.810> off<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.170> just<00:01:22.439> we<00:01:23.189> can

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
guess i'll turn it off and just we can

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.880 
guess i'll turn it off and just we can
compare<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:23.820> contrast<00:01:26.390> it<00:01:27.390> comes<00:01:27.630> with<00:01:27.890> some

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
compare and contrast it comes with some

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.990 
compare and contrast it comes with some
pretty<00:01:29.070> cool<00:01:29.420> software<00:01:31.340> that<00:01:32.340> allows<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:32.850> to

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
software and this is the box that it

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.179 
software and this is the box that it
comes<00:01:45.990> in<00:01:46.200> looks<00:01:47.070> like<00:01:47.189> that

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
comes in looks like that

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:52.370 
comes in looks like that
it's<00:01:50.189> kind<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.460> show<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.869> software<00:01:52.229> is

it's kind of show it and the software is

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.670 
it's kind of show it and the software is
actually<00:01:52.710> displayed<00:01:53.220> right<00:01:53.460> there<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.680> I

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
actually displayed right there and I

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.289 
actually displayed right there and I

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
think if you give me a second i can

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.690 
think if you give me a second i can
actually<00:01:59.180> open<00:02:00.180> this<00:02:00.479> up<00:02:01.100> so<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.250> can<00:02:02.460> get<00:02:02.640> a

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
actually open this up so you can get a

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:21.390 
actually open this up so you can get a
look

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
around whatnot how much to it um the

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.220 
around whatnot how much to it um the
camera<00:03:08.840> itself<00:03:08.959> is<00:03:09.440> a<00:03:09.470> 4<00:03:10.099> gigabytes<00:03:11.049> it's<00:03:12.049> not

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
camera itself is a 4 gigabytes it's not

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:19.530 
camera itself is a 4 gigabytes it's not
expandable<00:03:12.799> and<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:17.780> car<00:03:17.989> comes<00:03:18.319> with<00:03:18.440> a<00:03:18.530> USB

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
expandable and the car comes with a USB

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.630 
expandable and the car comes with a USB
already<00:03:20.560> like<00:03:21.560> it's<00:03:21.709> attached<00:03:22.010> to<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.250> camera

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
so that's kind of the problem it might

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.039 
so that's kind of the problem it might
not<00:03:26.450> be<00:03:26.510> the<00:03:26.780> best<00:03:26.989> camera<00:03:27.290> for<00:03:27.500> you<00:03:28.870> it<00:03:29.870> does

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
what I can record in I'd say relatively

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.840 
what I can record in I'd say relatively
low<00:05:18.040> light<00:05:18.510> I<00:05:19.510> mean<00:05:20.410> you<00:05:20.500> could<00:05:20.590> get<00:05:20.800> a<00:05:21.160> lot

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
low light I mean you could get a lot

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.350 
low light I mean you could get a lot
less<00:05:21.910> light<00:05:22.300> than<00:05:22.330> this<00:05:22.660> I<00:05:23.700> guess<00:05:24.700> I<00:05:25.000> can<00:05:25.150> close

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
less light than this I guess I can close

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:32.970 
less light than this I guess I can close
the<00:05:25.540> blinds<00:05:25.840> sure<00:05:26.560> a<00:05:26.890> lot<00:05:27.220> looks<00:05:27.490> like<00:05:31.980> so

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:32.980 
the blinds sure a lot looks like so

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.840 
the blinds sure a lot looks like so
that's<00:05:33.400> a<00:05:33.550> lot<00:05:33.730> less<00:05:33.760> light<00:05:34.300> but<00:05:34.690> I<00:05:34.720> mean<00:05:35.850> my

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:36.850 
that's a lot less light but I mean my

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.790 
that's a lot less light but I mean my
blind<00:05:37.480> basically<00:05:38.140> wants<00:05:38.350> her<00:05:38.440> clothes<00:05:38.680> they
