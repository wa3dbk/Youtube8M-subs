00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
come up to me and talk to me generally I

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.660 
come up to me and talk to me generally I
think<00:01:32.440> if<00:01:32.649> people<00:01:32.680> don't<00:01:33.100> like<00:01:33.160> this<00:01:33.430> type<00:01:33.640> of

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
think if people don't like this type of

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.430 
think if people don't like this type of
music<00:01:33.940> or<00:01:34.180> don't<00:01:34.360> get<00:01:34.539> it<00:01:34.720> they<00:01:34.899> just<00:01:35.110> keep

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
music or don't get it they just keep

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.370 
music or don't get it they just keep
quiet<00:01:36.000> scurry<00:01:37.000> out<00:01:37.119> it's<00:01:37.720> not<00:01:37.930> very<00:01:38.110> different

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
quiet scurry out it's not very different

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.940 
quiet scurry out it's not very different
from<00:01:38.590> DJ

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
from DJ

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.230 
from DJ
so<00:01:40.100> um<00:01:40.729> I<00:01:41.329> think<00:01:42.460> Club<00:01:43.460> goers<00:01:43.700> are<00:01:44.000> a<00:01:44.060> lot<00:01:44.210> more

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
so um I think Club goers are a lot more

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.279 
so um I think Club goers are a lot more
receptive<00:01:44.960> to<00:01:45.259> my<00:01:45.289> kind<00:01:45.799> of<00:01:46.009> stuff<00:01:46.939> then<00:01:47.329> let's

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
receptive to my kind of stuff then let's

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:50.440 
receptive to my kind of stuff then let's
say<00:01:48.469> somebody<00:01:48.710> who<00:01:48.979> goes<00:01:49.280> watches<00:01:49.939> banter

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
say somebody who goes watches banter

00:01:50.450 --> 00:02:01.899 
say somebody who goes watches banter

was<00:02:19.190> more<00:02:19.400> of<00:02:19.430> a<00:02:19.660> deconstruction<00:02:20.660> and

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
was more of a deconstruction and

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.720 
was more of a deconstruction and
experimentation<00:02:21.620> on<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.069> beat<00:02:22.220> so<00:02:22.430> it's<00:02:22.459> more

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
experimentation on the beat so it's more

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.229 
experimentation on the beat so it's more
like<00:02:23.019> live<00:02:24.019> be<00:02:24.319> programming<00:02:25.239> sound
