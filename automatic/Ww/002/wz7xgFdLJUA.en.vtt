00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.650

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.550

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.040
 colors namely 0 4 coral well I troll 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.740

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.840
 little bit of color and press it yourself 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.820

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.740
 is a fairly neutral color and the likes 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.840
 from van 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.070
 yes this also has three beautiful colors and 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.470
 this has to be with you too 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.730
 kind of bronze color so I would 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.830
 might also be able to contour 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.840
 I don't know, but yes I like it 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.360
 I still have a really great look 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.950
 one tip is i was very maybe gone 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.690
 to say a kind of primer 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.060
 what you need to get over your lips 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.130
 And therefore the lipstick or lip gloss 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.650
 or whatever you use and find out 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.360
 or stay longer but if so 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.160
 has of course already started testing that angle 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.290
 but yes I wanted this is very much like 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.380
 Finally I try 3 more lipsticks 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.730
 to if you know me then always must 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.340
 I have now taken lipsticks 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.890
 why I know lipstick that is just 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.150
 together one so I have three and I was 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.720
 so curious about it anyway 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.890
 lipsticks from kiko so I have 3 and 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.739
 I have three really very different ones 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.320
 colors as first yes they have none 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.890

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:55.560

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.660
 color 906 and this is one 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.120
 yes presses colored lipstick there is one 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.980
 pretty curious from the camera but still 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.260
 well more 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.260

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:12.080
 then strikes 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.670
 color 910 and this is really a baby pink 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.500
 I'm really crazy about color 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.790

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.919
 and well I'm super happy with it 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.229
 furthermore I got completely loose at the 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.130
 eye shadows that were discounted from 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:25.580

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:28.490
 four five euros to some for 190 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.500
 another for 92 and yes I could just have them 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.150
 don't pass up and it's a super thing 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:38.270
 good quality 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:40.400
 I have three eye shadows and the 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.870
 bought in the baked version say 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:47.479

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:56.930
 Registry of those are really great 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.940
 I have one is a duo and one that has 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.630

 and a beautiful shimmer he now also 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:11.570
 brown color he looks like little gold 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:13.580
 camera but he is a bit brown and like 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.680
 last of the baked eye shadows 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.169
 I buy a yes really a color is this 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.580
 years and these eye shadows are both wet 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:21.979
 to use as dry so if you need a moment 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:25.010
 wet your brush and then train 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:27.050
 goes on your eye then the shim 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.460
 shimmer's and the color really increase as 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.160
 cats 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:35.030
 in addition, I also have a number 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:37.250
 had such a crazy 6 pieces from the yes normal 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.830
 collection of normal eye shadows 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.599
 purchased I think the box is fair 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.979
 said a little yes a little chipo 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:44.599
 made 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:46.270
 Lenny just said they remind me of it 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:48.620
 but the eye shadows of the action 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.370
 on the other hand, the quality is real 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.370
 super 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.780
 I mainly bought some brown colors 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.520
 This is an example is really one 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:59.169
 dark brown color that I intend 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.169
 to use in crisis 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:02.810
 In addition, I was actually looking for one 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.030
 bit of a good color for really just 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.870
 eyelid and there I actually have this 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.150
 before bought it is a bit 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.800
 yes a very nice champagne color bit 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.600
 against pressing k so I am whole 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.690
 curious how that 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.570
 to look like my eye 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:20.310
 I also bought a highlight color 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.570
 which she bit in a golden color I had 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.640
 I think so 

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:25.290
 solid white highlight color did not catch 

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.700
 very nice with it so I always love 

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:29.760
 some more 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:31.970
 yes of those what golden colors and that is 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.970
 this one 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.680
 In addition, I also have some pretty yes 

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:42.120
 bought bright colors 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:45.140
 one in a little sea ​​green sea blue yes 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:49.290
 cool blue color and one in one 

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:51.420
 purple color and it has very light 

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:54.390
 ardian blue jam it is your sarandon 

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:56.880
 hard to see but he has the 

00:06:54.390 --> 00:07:00.810
 and finally I have a tan 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:03.060
 color also bought with a somewhat light 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:04.980
 shimmer in and that is unfortunately they had 

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:08.400
 no names but all numbers 

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:10.530
 but yes that is a mistake 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.390
 time could even with lipstick 

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:14.430
 just a pity that you have money in the webshop 

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:14.940
 they just make names when you order 

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:16.350
 and 

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:18.150
 see you see home then school have no 

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:19.980
 names that is just really a shame let's 

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:21.600
 are otherwise shopped on marloes 

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.920
 and of course for me that I do 

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.540
 really happy with it 

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:26.010
 otherwise I will not know how it goes 

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:27.840
 article must also come yes it is 

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:29.670
 webshops of course 

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.230
 marea in the stores just nice to 

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:33.330
 see which colors are and you can see them 

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:36.330
 blacks and it just looks nicer 

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:38.520
 natural our see yes kiko is one 

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:41.220
 Italian brands also have makeup 

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:44.100
 up by means of make up milano 

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:45.780
 and i have heard that kiko really 

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:47.730
 available in the countries first all around 

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:49.680
 italy spain france 

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:52.710
 there they are getting married so you go on 

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:55.200
 vacation and you see a go there because 

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:57.120
 it's really super good quality for that 

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.850
 not much money at all maybe 

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.710
 the shields even and I would say
