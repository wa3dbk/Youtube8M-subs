00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.260
 hello friends welcome to another tuto 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.450
 Tuesday 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:18.310
 I am leonardo pérez grandson and today we are going 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:20.650
 to use drivers or dry brush 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.250
 with a little paint today or in your 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:27.730
 palette and smear the brush slightly on 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.369
 then remove the excess using 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.489
 a sheet of paper or a rag or paper 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.210
 absorbent well we are ready to 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.640
 paint 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.829
 I recommend you start with areas 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.030
 they are not as important or at 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:45.610
 end they will go very dark 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.070
 like the top of the head or 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.250
 This area of ​​hair behind the face 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:54.219
 it's going to be very dark and when we take 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:57.579
 trust we can go on the skin with 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:01:00.610
 gentle pressure movements is better 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.829
 start clear darkening little by little 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.640
 instead of doing something too dark 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:08.400
 because then you can not clarify 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.890
 now with a little more paint and with 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.800
 a flat brush let's make the edge of the 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.380
 hair 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.960
 as you can see in this case I already had 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.060
 traced the face on the paper that is 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.630
 because this tutorial is specifically 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.880
 about drivers but in case you're interested 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.300
 see how to make the stroke for a portrait 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.090
 I'm going to put links to two tutorials in 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.930
 those who did portraits in pencil at the end 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.930
 of this video 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:41.030
 continue in the same way with little 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.460
 paint but with a finer brush for 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.229
 the detail 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.229
 and now the eyes 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.950
 and keep on enjoying your painting 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.920
 of course if you need to do something 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:08.870
 dark takes more solid but in general 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.870
 the brush will be almost almost dry like that 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.579
 I love to paint 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.579
 while it is wet you can erase and 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:22.580
 draw lights with a normal eraser for 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:25.510
 the pencil 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:29.080
 what good does not 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.040
 now let's make the lips and the shadow 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:36.640
 under the face 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.140
 this is a delicious technique 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.920
 the list of materials is in the 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.920
 information under the video very well now 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.870
 we must darken this area quite 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.209
 behind the face 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:54.250
 with a flat brush we can make 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:57.590
 some lines representing the hair 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.650
 excellent and with a thick brush and 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.850
 rounded we can give a general tone 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:07.030
 thus 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.540
 let's go back to a thin brush for the 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.540
 detail 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:17.840
 with this one with more ink we can achieve 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.840
 the details of the factions 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:27.100
 and more definition for the lips 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.970
 the superior is quite dark because 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.060
 it is in shadow 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:35.650
 with the brush almost clean we can give 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:38.920
 more volume shading slightly 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:42.480
 now the shoulder and the back let's do 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.480
 this with the thick brush 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:52.010
 very well here is the shade of the arm 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:54.980
 and back to the hair detail the 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:04:00.260
 painting with this technique is so nice 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:02.930
 I do not know how to explain a few 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.040
 Rebellious and disorganized hair 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.630
 they give more life 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.890
 darken the tone while we give 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.890
 more definition 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.360
 I hope this tutorial and this technique 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:22.459

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.459

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.680
 ready 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:38.619
