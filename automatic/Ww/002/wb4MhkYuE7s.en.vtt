00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.520
 Good day to all dear 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.919
 friends today i would like to touch 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.650
 question about the finish of the lesson these 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.519
 that is, how to do so to manifest 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.590
 maximum structure of our wood 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.840
 so that our handle will play and quite 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.449
 in a new way and burned his 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.550
 finish view in front of you those funds 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.810
 which I usually use for these 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.470
 goals is shellac danish butter oil for 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.949
 floor to 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.360
 and carnauba wax let's detail 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.120
 about these materials let's start shellac 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.559
 man is an alcohol solution 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.820
 lacquer flake naturally flake 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.820
 natural origin 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.500
 what we get as a result when it 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:56.149
 using 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:01:02.190
 Here I have a cat just we get 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:05.100
 beautiful wood structure beautiful 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.150
 glossy look or matte 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.520
 it all depends on your desire and finish 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:14.400
 by the way shellac is very well polished 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.430
 even just a hand after his full 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.820
 drying just stand and go third 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.049
 arm 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.009
 hand rub to the desired type of what else 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.310
 need to notice 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.610
 shellac poorly kept sharp edges 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:33.329
 so the edges we are for 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:35.420
 we grind a little bit round in order 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.909
 so that there are no sharp edges 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:43.200
 before starting to apply slag 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:45.270
 it is necessary to apply a primer primer as 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.210
 primer in this case I used 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.820
 oil of the shelf can be used teak 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.820
 oil left some other 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:03.060
 for the convenience of our work usually somewhere 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:06.240
 four five layers are applied here on 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.450
 According to the knife, I do not remember about six layers 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:14.250
 shellac and she didn't get it yet 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:16.739
 the result that I want still want 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.049
 notice that I have golden shellac he 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.910
 there is even more brown that is 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:29.030
 the result accordingly will be a little bit 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:31.940
 differ so much further danish oil 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:35.160
 Danish oil is very good material 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:38.190
 very good impregnation in principle 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:42.690
 no special prep work he 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.220
 does not require the only thing that finish under 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.420
 I try to make her 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:52.590
 finish either at 1000 legally 2000 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:57.299
 sandpaper by the way for shellac in principle 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.790
 enough 800 grit after we 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:05.220
 completely soaked 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:08.489
 this is 4 6 layers of danish oil at least 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:12.200
 three is sure it is written instruction 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.200
 we get this result 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:25.019
 go hand me. glossy 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.019
 polished glitters 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:35.019
 unfortunately for carnauba wax from me 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:38.860
 so far no example on hand 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:42.340
 there so it's on the knife 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.420
 which I am making now for you 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.629
 show the result 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:49.569
 Karnak gloss still would like to say 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:51.940
 passed the material that I have not long 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:54.610
 would use and would not advise you 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:58.870
 use for beautiful 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.930
 some handles this linseed oil here 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.299
 this little bar is just soaked 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.250
 green oil 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:10.239
 i.e. downs after complete polymerization 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:13.510
 it becomes like hard plastic not 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:18.100
 nourishes the water gets heavier but 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:22.030
 and brush but with long after 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:28.020
 a long time for but and butter she 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:31.539
 washes the structure that is, we are in time 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:36.160
 this is all the beauty that we have 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:40.530
 now it will just disappear and become 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:44.169
 more blurred more uniform therefore 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:46.389
 I don't use it anymore 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:51.310
 use for but and oil for some 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:56.470
 beautiful handles you know what the finish 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:05:00.460
 Here I just have a knife blank for now. 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:03.930
 what else is not soaked as you see 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:09.180
 she already glitters has a glossy look 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.180
 finish here two thousand grid 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.200
 see yes 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:26.700
 now i'm all rubbed with oil for the floor to 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:31.730
 after it is completely dry, it is already water 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:34.890
 apply Karnak wax 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:37.530
 let's not all this process 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:41.490
 delay not to increase the video 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:43.110
 I'll finish the mines and the result either as 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:48.750
 Carnauba wax is applied 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:51.600
 the process then turn on the camera already passed 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:56.640
 day the handle was prescribed in oil for 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:58.440
 got to the floor 

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:02.280
 see the texture 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.660
 has become more expressive drawing now 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.610
 it is necessary to rub 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.610
 this is all carnauba wax am 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:25.980
 so we finished processing the handle 

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:29.620
 the result can see them yourself 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:31.830
 the handle has got even more glossy 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.830
 view 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:50.159
 so here it all now looks on it 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:50.159
 all hope you were wondering bye
