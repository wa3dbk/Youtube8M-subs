00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
add a sweet some sweepnurbs go here at a

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.480 
add a sweet some sweepnurbs go here at a
circle<00:01:33.140> you're<00:01:34.140> gonna<00:01:34.259> put<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.770> circle

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
circle you're gonna put the circle

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.450 
circle you're gonna put the circle
underneath<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.060> sweepnurbs<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.960> then<00:01:37.829> the

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
underneath the sweepnurbs and then the

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.730 
underneath the sweepnurbs and then the
text<00:01:38.909> underneath<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.720> circle<00:01:40.229> now<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:40.619> is

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
text underneath the circle now this is

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.810 
text underneath the circle now this is
going<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.950> happen<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.250> want<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.490> change<00:01:41.670> the

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
going to happen you want to change the

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.859 
going to happen you want to change the
circle<00:01:42.270> radius<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.869> about<00:01:42.899> one<00:01:43.350> centimeter

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
circle radius to about one centimeter

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.960 
circle radius to about one centimeter
and<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:46.770> now<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.009> see<00:01:47.280> you've<00:01:47.430> got<00:01:47.460> this<00:01:47.729> kind

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
and so now you see you've got this kind

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.789 
and so now you see you've got this kind
of<00:01:48.060> outline<00:01:48.479> effects<00:01:48.930> if<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.439> go<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.619> the

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
of outline effects if you go to the

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.679 
of outline effects if you go to the
circle<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.549> turn<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.970> radius<00:01:51.299> up<00:01:51.479> that's

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
circle and you turn the radius up that's

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.240 
circle and you turn the radius up that's
how<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:51.899> make<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.200> very<00:01:52.380> small<00:01:53.420> and<00:01:55.070> so<00:01:56.070> now

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
how you make it very small and so now

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.910 
how you make it very small and so now
what<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.299> sweet<00:01:57.570> note<00:01:57.810> nobis<00:01:58.380> does<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:58.770> that

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
what the sweet note nobis does is that

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.700 
what the sweet note nobis does is that
you<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.670> can<00:01:59.820> wake<00:02:00.000> up<00:02:00.030> essentially<00:02:00.930> sweep<00:02:01.409> I

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
you you can wake up essentially sweep I

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.100 
you you can wake up essentially sweep I
guess<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.040> could<00:02:02.159> say<00:02:02.189> so<00:02:02.369> if<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.600> turn<00:02:04.079> down

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
guess you could say so if I turn down

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.440 
guess you could say so if I turn down
the<00:02:04.409> end<00:02:04.560> group<00:02:04.799> all<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.579> way<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.729> zero<00:02:06.119> you

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
the end group all the way to zero you

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.660 
the end group all the way to zero you
can<00:02:06.570> see<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:06.869> there's<00:02:07.020> no<00:02:07.200> outline<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:08.069> if<00:02:08.550> I

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
can see that there's no outline and if I

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.360 
can see that there's no outline and if I
print<00:02:08.879> up<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.390> 100%<00:02:10.080> then<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:10.830> out<00:02:11.009> one<00:02:11.160> it's<00:02:11.310> a

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
print up to 100% then it out one it's a

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.080 
print up to 100% then it out one it's a
text<00:02:11.840> so<00:02:12.840> what<00:02:12.959> you<00:02:13.080> do<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:13.379> can<00:02:13.560> just

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
text so what you do you can just

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.600 
text so what you do you can just
keyframe<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.239> anger<00:02:15.569> if<00:02:15.629> they're<00:02:15.870> by<00:02:16.739> control

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
keyframe the anger if they're by control

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.449 
keyframe the anger if they're by control
clicking<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:18.150> little<00:02:18.480> dot<00:02:18.750> there<00:02:18.860> go<00:02:19.860> up<00:02:20.010> 90

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
clicking the little dot there go up 90

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.479 
clicking the little dot there go up 90
frames<00:02:20.700> or<00:02:21.000> so<00:02:21.209> change<00:02:21.750> it<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:21.900> 100%<00:02:22.430> add<00:02:23.430> a

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
frames or so change it to 100% add a

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.630 
frames or so change it to 100% add a
keyframe<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:24.390> now<00:02:25.319> you<00:02:25.379> have<00:02:25.890> this<00:02:26.129> cool

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
keyframe and now you have this cool

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.770 
keyframe and now you have this cool
outline<00:02:27.300> effect<00:02:28.160> so<00:02:29.160> as<00:02:29.459> well<00:02:29.819> as<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.390> end

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
outline effect so as well as the end

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.160 
outline effect so as well as the end
growth<00:02:31.200> as<00:02:31.530> you<00:02:32.280> can<00:02:32.489> see<00:02:33.180> here<00:02:33.720> if<00:02:33.870> I<00:02:33.959> turn

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
growth as you can see here if I turn

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.380 
growth as you can see here if I turn
that<00:02:34.319> up<00:02:34.500> it<00:02:35.340> also<00:02:35.459> got<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.849> start<00:02:36.120> growth

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
that up it also got the start growth

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.660 
that up it also got the start growth
which<00:02:36.780> is<00:02:36.959> essentially<00:02:37.650> if<00:02:38.160> you've<00:02:38.310> got<00:02:38.489> some

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
which is essentially if you've got some

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.190 
which is essentially if you've got some
end<00:02:38.849> growth<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.360> that'll<00:02:39.569> kind<00:02:39.810> of<00:02:39.870> take<00:02:40.050> it

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
end growth and that'll kind of take it

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.449 
end growth and that'll kind of take it
away<00:02:40.260> so<00:02:40.410> if<00:02:40.680> you<00:02:40.769> want<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:40.950> have<00:02:41.040> an<00:02:41.099> outline

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
away so if you want to have an outline

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.369 
away so if you want to have an outline
around<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:42.060> text<00:02:42.480> but<00:02:42.690> you<00:02:42.810> don't<00:02:42.989> want<00:02:43.200> it<00:02:43.290> to

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
around the text but you don't want it to

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.820 
around the text but you don't want it to
be<00:02:43.500> there<00:02:43.739> all<00:02:43.950> at<00:02:44.099> the<00:02:44.190> same<00:02:44.370> time<00:02:45.319> then<00:02:46.319> you

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
be there all at the same time then you

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.559 
be there all at the same time then you
can<00:02:46.980> use<00:02:47.099> this<00:02:47.280> okay<00:02:47.940> so<00:02:48.000> what<00:02:48.300> I'm<00:02:48.390> going<00:02:48.540> to

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
can use this okay so what I'm going to

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.949 
can use this okay so what I'm going to
do<00:02:48.750> here<00:02:49.019> is<00:02:49.260> I'm<00:02:50.190> going<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:50.660> get<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.780> end

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
do here is I'm going to get the end

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.550 
do here is I'm going to get the end
growth<00:02:52.879> put<00:02:53.879> it<00:02:53.970> all<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.209> way<00:02:54.239> up<00:02:54.480> here

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
growth put it all the way up here

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.070 
growth put it all the way up here
hundred<00:02:55.560> percent<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:56.790> so<00:02:57.569> now<00:02:57.690> we've<00:02:57.930> got

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
hundred percent and so now we've got

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.890 
hundred percent and so now we've got
this<00:02:58.790> outline<00:02:59.790> effect<00:03:00.150> like<00:03:00.330> we<00:03:00.480> had<00:03:00.629> before

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
this outline effect like we had before

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.420 
this outline effect like we had before
and<00:03:01.830> less<00:03:01.950> of<00:03:02.129> stuff<00:03:02.640> something<00:03:02.879> out<00:03:03.120> I<00:03:04.430> forgot

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
and less of stuff something out I forgot

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.780 
and less of stuff something out I forgot
to<00:03:05.519> set<00:03:05.640> a<00:03:05.670> key<00:03:05.940> for<00:03:06.120> him<00:03:09.080> there<00:03:10.080> we<00:03:10.170> go<00:03:10.349> and<00:03:10.709> so

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
to set a key for him there we go and so

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.180 
to set a key for him there we go and so
now<00:03:11.790> all<00:03:11.819> at<00:03:12.209> about<00:03:12.510> 20<00:03:13.349> frames<00:03:13.590> in<00:03:13.830> I'm<00:03:14.069> gonna

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
now all at about 20 frames in I'm gonna

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.770 
now all at about 20 frames in I'm gonna
keep<00:03:14.550> her<00:03:14.700> in<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.879> start<00:03:15.180> and<00:03:15.769> then<00:03:16.769> let's<00:03:16.950> go

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
keep her in the start and then let's go

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:24.020 
keep her in the start and then let's go
210<00:03:18.780> frames<00:03:19.200> here<00:03:19.590> and<00:03:20.000> then<00:03:22.670> keyframes<00:03:23.670> start

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
210 frames here and then keyframes start

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.210 
210 frames here and then keyframes start
again<00:03:25.700> so<00:03:26.700> now<00:03:26.849> as<00:03:27.000> you<00:03:27.030> can<00:03:27.269> see<00:03:27.629> as<00:03:27.870> it<00:03:28.220> starts

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
again so now as you can see as it starts

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.220 
again so now as you can see as it starts
out<00:03:29.370> line<00:03:29.610> it<00:03:29.819> also<00:03:29.970> takes<00:03:30.750> away<00:03:30.870> from<00:03:31.140> the

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
out line it also takes away from the

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.559 
out line it also takes away from the
back<00:03:31.440> of<00:03:31.470> it<00:03:31.739> so<00:03:32.670> that's<00:03:32.760> just<00:03:33.030> a<00:03:33.150> little<00:03:33.269> cool

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
back of it so that's just a little cool

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.229 
back of it so that's just a little cool
effect<00:03:33.840> you<00:03:33.959> can<00:03:34.110> do<00:03:34.849> now<00:03:35.849> to<00:03:35.879> give<00:03:36.150> it<00:03:36.209> a

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
effect you can do now to give it a

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.110 
effect you can do now to give it a
material<00:03:36.810> if<00:03:36.930> you're<00:03:37.080> going<00:03:37.200> to<00:03:37.349> go<00:03:37.500> down<00:03:37.650> here

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
material if you're going to go down here

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.149 
material if you're going to go down here
you<00:03:39.120> don't<00:03:39.239> have<00:03:39.420> to<00:03:39.540> follow<00:03:40.049> exactly<00:03:40.319> what<00:03:40.920> I

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:41.159 
you don't have to follow exactly what I

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:43.220 
you don't have to follow exactly what I
do<00:03:41.280> but<00:03:41.580> I<00:03:41.670> think<00:03:41.849> it's<00:03:42.000> that's<00:03:42.390> a<00:03:42.599> pretty<00:03:42.989> cool

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
do but I think it's that's a pretty cool

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.800 
do but I think it's that's a pretty cool
effect<00:03:43.700> just<00:03:44.700> gonna<00:03:44.909> go<00:03:45.060> to<00:03:45.120> luminance

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
effect just gonna go to luminance

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.930 
effect just gonna go to luminance
here<00:03:46.650> I'm<00:03:46.739> going<00:03:46.860> to<00:03:46.950> add<00:03:47.040> a<00:03:47.069> color<00:03:47.430> let's<00:03:47.819> go

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
here I'm going to add a color let's go

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.410 
here I'm going to add a color let's go
with<00:03:48.120> green<00:03:48.599> and<00:03:49.849> turn<00:03:50.849> the<00:03:50.940> brightness<00:03:51.120> all

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
with green and turn the brightness all

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.170 
with green and turn the brightness all
the<00:03:51.480> way<00:03:51.540> up<00:03:51.629> to<00:03:51.810> 300%<00:03:52.790> now<00:03:53.790> I'm<00:03:53.849> going<00:03:54.000> to<00:03:54.060> add

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
the way up to 300% now I'm going to add

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.339 
the way up to 300% now I'm going to add
that<00:03:54.360> to<00:03:54.659> the<00:03:54.689> sweet<00:03:55.110> NURBS<00:03:55.349> up<00:03:55.590> here<00:03:57.290> so<00:03:58.290> you

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
that to the sweet NURBS up here so you

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:00.979 
that to the sweet NURBS up here so you
can<00:03:58.409> see<00:03:58.739> it<00:03:58.950> doesn't<00:03:59.250> look<00:03:59.610> exactly<00:03:59.849> grain<00:04:00.720> in

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
can see it doesn't look exactly grain in

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.199 
can see it doesn't look exactly grain in
the<00:04:01.080> editor<00:04:01.500> like<00:04:01.799> looks<00:04:02.040> really<00:04:02.610> bright<00:04:02.909> but

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
the editor like looks really bright but

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.059 
the editor like looks really bright but
it's<00:04:03.720> not<00:04:03.840> actually<00:04:04.170> that<00:04:04.200> right<00:04:04.620> so<00:04:04.920> now<00:04:05.040> it's

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
it's not actually that right so now it's

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.449 
it's not actually that right so now it's
at<00:04:05.459> a<00:04:05.489> floor

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
at a floor

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:12.430 
at a floor
it's<00:04:07.849> a<00:04:08.030> reflection<00:04:10.569> that's<00:04:11.569> the<00:04:11.750> floor<00:04:12.050> and

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
it's a reflection that's the floor and

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.170 
it's a reflection that's the floor and
now<00:04:13.130> we're<00:04:13.250> gonna<00:04:13.340> go<00:04:13.520> into<00:04:13.670> the<00:04:13.790> render

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
now we're gonna go into the render

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.289 
now we're gonna go into the render
settings<00:04:14.569> so<00:04:14.860> I'd<00:04:15.860> recommend<00:04:16.160> adding<00:04:16.669> ambient

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
settings so I'd recommend adding ambient

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.599 
settings so I'd recommend adding ambient
occlusion<00:04:17.540> that<00:04:18.410> just<00:04:18.650> puts<00:04:18.980> shadows<00:04:19.370> in

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
occlusion that just puts shadows in

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:21.970 
occlusion that just puts shadows in
between<00:04:19.970> like<00:04:20.419> we're<00:04:20.630> ever<00:04:20.959> edges<00:04:21.739> are<00:04:21.829> close

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
between like we're ever edges are close

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.580 
between like we're ever edges are close
together<00:04:22.310> then<00:04:23.300> go<00:04:23.450> effect<00:04:23.900> global

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
together then go effect global

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.580 
together then go effect global
illumination<00:04:25.030> now<00:04:26.030> my<00:04:26.750> preferred<00:04:27.139> settings

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
illumination now my preferred settings

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.590 
illumination now my preferred settings
for<00:04:27.830> this<00:04:27.980> is<00:04:28.310> to<00:04:28.610> change<00:04:28.880> it<00:04:29.030> to<00:04:29.120> the<00:04:29.210> legacy

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
for this is to change it to the legacy

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.900 
for this is to change it to the legacy
version<00:04:29.990> if<00:04:30.139> you're<00:04:30.260> using<00:04:30.470> our<00:04:30.889> 13<00:04:31.430> or<00:04:31.639> lower

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
version if you're using our 13 or lower

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.900 
version if you're using our 13 or lower
then<00:04:32.300> that'll<00:04:32.900> be<00:04:33.020> a<00:04:33.050> normal<00:04:33.710> one<00:04:33.910> change

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
then that'll be a normal one change

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.090 
then that'll be a normal one change
samples<00:04:35.450> to<00:04:35.600> low<00:04:35.780> go<00:04:36.230> to<00:04:36.290> the<00:04:36.740> irradiance

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
samples to low go to the irradiance

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.930 
samples to low go to the irradiance
cache<00:04:37.250> and<00:04:37.850> change<00:04:38.090> this<00:04:38.419> to<00:04:38.660> low<00:04:39.610> now<00:04:40.610> let's

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
cache and change this to low now let's

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:47.379 
cache and change this to low now let's
give<00:04:41.180> it<00:04:41.210> a<00:04:41.470> render<00:04:44.680> and<00:04:45.680> as<00:04:46.639> you<00:04:46.790> can<00:04:46.910> see<00:04:46.970> it

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
give it a render and as you can see it

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:50.170 
give it a render and as you can see it
gives<00:04:47.570> a<00:04:47.750> pretty<00:04:47.960> cool<00:04:48.260> effect<00:04:48.850> so<00:04:49.850> yeah

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
gives a pretty cool effect so yeah

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.800 
gives a pretty cool effect so yeah
that's<00:04:50.419> pretty<00:04:50.510> much<00:04:50.810> how<00:04:51.290> to<00:04:51.350> do<00:04:51.560> that<00:04:51.710> now

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
that's pretty much how to do that now

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.040 
that's pretty much how to do that now
the<00:04:53.810> reason<00:04:54.110> why<00:04:54.260> I<00:04:54.290> added<00:04:54.590> a<00:04:54.680> circle<00:04:55.870> for<00:04:56.870> the

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
the reason why I added a circle for the

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.930 
the reason why I added a circle for the
outline<00:04:57.590> is<00:04:57.860> because<00:04:58.310> that's<00:04:58.490> the<00:04:58.639> shape<00:04:58.910> that

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
outline is because that's the shape that

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.330 
outline is because that's the shape that
this<00:04:59.210> gives<00:04:59.479> here<00:04:59.780> you<00:05:00.620> can<00:05:00.740> see<00:05:00.979> it's<00:05:01.100> sort<00:05:01.280> of

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
this gives here you can see it's sort of

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.020 
this gives here you can see it's sort of
a<00:05:01.460> circle<00:05:02.150> shape<00:05:02.360> I<00:05:03.139> can<00:05:03.830> go<00:05:04.400> here<00:05:04.639> and<00:05:04.850> say

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
a circle shape I can go here and say

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.050 
a circle shape I can go here and say
let's<00:05:05.180> get<00:05:05.330> a<00:05:05.389> flower<00:05:05.780> I<00:05:06.260> will<00:05:06.740> put<00:05:07.340> that<00:05:07.370> there

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
let's get a flower I will put that there

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.840 
let's get a flower I will put that there
get<00:05:09.050> rid<00:05:09.200> of<00:05:09.229> that<00:05:09.440> then<00:05:10.310> I'll<00:05:10.400> change<00:05:10.610> the

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
get rid of that then I'll change the

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.010 
get rid of that then I'll change the
radius<00:05:11.410> down<00:05:12.410> to<00:05:12.590> like<00:05:12.740> one<00:05:13.340> by<00:05:13.520> two<00:05:13.990> and<00:05:14.990> you

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
radius down to like one by two and you

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.409 
radius down to like one by two and you
can<00:05:15.140> see<00:05:15.260> that<00:05:16.010> you<00:05:16.220> get<00:05:16.669> that<00:05:17.000> kind<00:05:17.240> of<00:05:17.300> a

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
can see that you get that kind of a

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:19.630 
can see that you get that kind of a
shape<00:05:17.830> it's<00:05:18.830> hard<00:05:19.010> to<00:05:19.130> see<00:05:19.250> that<00:05:19.370> that's<00:05:19.550> a

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
shape it's hard to see that that's a

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.060 
shape it's hard to see that that's a
flower<00:05:19.910> but<00:05:20.390> if<00:05:20.510> I<00:05:20.630> just<00:05:20.900> add<00:05:21.200> it<00:05:21.350> again

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:30.480 

finder<00:05:25.070> is<00:05:27.490> then<00:05:28.490> you<00:05:28.669> can<00:05:28.850> kind<00:05:29.090> of<00:05:29.180> see

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
finder is then you can kind of see

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.880 
finder is then you can kind of see
that's<00:05:31.490> the<00:05:31.610> kind<00:05:31.789> of<00:05:31.940> shape<00:05:32.240> it's<00:05:32.390> giving<00:05:32.690> you

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:32.890 
that's the kind of shape it's giving you

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.740 
that's the kind of shape it's giving you
so<00:05:33.890> you<00:05:33.979> got<00:05:34.100> the<00:05:34.190> two<00:05:34.430> lines<00:05:35.030> here<00:05:35.479> and<00:05:35.630> then

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
so you got the two lines here and then

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:43.230 
so you got the two lines here and then
these<00:05:36.110> two<00:05:36.350> go<00:05:37.419> and<00:05:38.440> so<00:05:39.440> yeah<00:05:39.590> that's<00:05:39.830> about<00:05:40.160> it

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.080 

thanks<00:05:43.900> for<00:05:44.020> watching
