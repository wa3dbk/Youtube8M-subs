00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
of my friends but when I think is the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.890 
of my friends but when I think is the
typical<00:00:29.340> Australian<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:30.210> think<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.630> someone

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
typical Australian I think of someone

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.069 
typical Australian I think of someone
definitely<00:00:31.590> who's<00:00:31.920> Caucasian<00:00:32.610> brown<00:00:33.510> haired

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
blonde hair blue eyes and I think that's

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.069 
blonde hair blue eyes and I think that's
what<00:00:37.800> Americans<00:00:38.579> think<00:00:38.670> too<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.480> when<00:00:39.899> they

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
what Americans think too so when they

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.010 
what Americans think too so when they
see<00:00:40.140> me<00:00:40.530> they<00:00:41.329> expect<00:00:42.329> someone<00:00:42.600> who's<00:00:42.780> going

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
see me they expect someone who's going

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.290 
see me they expect someone who's going
to<00:00:43.079> speak<00:00:43.290> with<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.530> American<00:00:44.160> accent<00:00:45.030> or

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
to speak with a American accent or

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.920 
to speak with a American accent or
someone<00:00:46.230> with<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.440> really<00:00:47.399> bad<00:00:47.879> Asian<00:00:48.329> accent

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930
