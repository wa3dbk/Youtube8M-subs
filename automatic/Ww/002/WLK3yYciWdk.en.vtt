00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.750 
but of course you have hours just to
observe<00:04:08.290> you<00:04:08.500> know<00:04:08.530> an<00:04:08.740> exponent<00:04:09.160> when<00:04:09.430> people

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
observe you know an exponent when people

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.430 
observe you know an exponent when people
run<00:04:09.880> because<00:04:09.970> people<00:04:10.660> run<00:04:10.810> in<00:04:10.930> all<00:04:11.020> sorts<00:04:11.350> of

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
actually run they do this sort of very

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:23.150 
actually run they do this sort of very
fast<00:04:15.520> minutes

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.040 

and<00:04:23.610> there's<00:04:23.790> blokes<00:04:24.060> who<00:04:24.540> run<00:04:24.780> and<00:04:24.960> they

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
and there's blokes who run and they

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.210
