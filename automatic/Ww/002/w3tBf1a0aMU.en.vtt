now I'm on the way out to do some
strength<00:00:59.890> today

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
strength today

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.869 
strength today
it<00:01:02.480> looks<00:01:02.660> like<00:01:02.840> I'm<00:01:03.050> going<00:01:03.260> into<00:01:03.620> hell<00:01:03.920> bunch

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
it looks like I'm going into hell bunch

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.140 
it looks like I'm going into hell bunch
of<00:01:05.090> whores<00:01:05.600> by<00:01:05.870> yourself<00:01:06.380> here

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
of whores by yourself here

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.410 
of whores by yourself here
totally<00:01:09.140> socked<00:01:09.860> in<00:01:10.130> this<00:01:10.310> whole<00:01:10.520> valley<00:01:10.910> can

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
totally socked in this whole valley can

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:19.760 
totally socked in this whole valley can
see<00:01:11.840> the<00:01:11.960> mountains

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.450 

okay<00:01:20.770> so<00:01:20.830> we<00:01:21.310> got<00:01:21.460> a<00:01:21.490> good<00:01:21.700> bedrock<00:01:22.180> zone<00:01:22.510> here

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.650 

and<00:01:27.460> the<00:01:27.580> trick<00:01:27.820> to<00:01:28.060> bedrock<00:01:28.840> sniping<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:31.450> to

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
and the trick to bedrock sniping is to

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.780 
and the trick to bedrock sniping is to
locate<00:01:31.810> the<00:01:32.290> gold<00:01:32.530> path<00:01:35.130> okay<00:01:36.130> so<00:01:36.190> we<00:01:36.640> got<00:01:36.760> a

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
locate the gold path okay so we got a

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.150 
locate the gold path okay so we got a
small<00:01:37.800> section<00:01:38.800> here<00:01:38.830> opened<00:01:39.460> up<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:41.710> bedrock

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
small section here opened up the bedrock

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.440 
small section here opened up the bedrock
looks<00:01:42.660> regular<00:01:43.660> enough<00:01:44.080> to<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:44.470> sheep<00:01:45.300> and<00:01:46.300> it

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
looks regular enough to the sheep and it

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.940 
looks regular enough to the sheep and it
could<00:01:46.630> contain<00:01:46.990> some<00:01:47.050> gold<00:01:47.470> so<00:01:47.830> the

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
could contain some gold so the

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.610 
could contain some gold so the
low-pressure<00:01:48.310> zone<00:01:48.900> gravel<00:01:49.900> fairly<00:01:50.320> packed

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
low-pressure zone gravel fairly packed

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.220 
low-pressure zone gravel fairly packed
that's<00:01:51.190> a<00:01:51.310> good<00:01:51.460> sign<00:01:51.790> there<00:01:52.450> just<00:01:52.660> drop<00:01:53.020> in

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.230 
that's a good sign there just drop in

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.900 
that's a good sign there just drop in
here<00:01:53.470> when<00:01:53.740> the<00:01:53.860> water<00:01:54.040> went<00:01:54.370> low<00:01:56.790> we're<00:01:57.790> going

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910 
here when the water went low we're going

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:13.020 
here when the water went low we're going
to<00:01:58.000> go<00:01:58.330> up<00:02:09.899> that<00:02:10.899> we'll<00:02:11.260> work<00:02:11.440> our<00:02:11.650> way<00:02:12.030> further

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
to go up that we'll work our way further

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:19.610 
to go up that we'll work our way further
up<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:15.490> if<00:02:15.640> you<00:02:15.850> can<00:02:16.440> find<00:02:17.440> their<00:02:17.770> trip<00:02:18.100> oh

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
okay so this turned out to be prime

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.660 
okay so this turned out to be prime
example<00:02:40.570> of<00:02:40.800> time<00:02:41.800> to<00:02:42.010> move<00:02:42.190> on

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
example of time to move on

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.030 
example of time to move on
I<00:02:42.700> found<00:02:43.269> five<00:02:44.170> small<00:02:45.690> specks<00:02:46.690> of<00:02:46.900> gold<00:02:47.080> in

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
I found five small specks of gold in

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.690 
I found five small specks of gold in
almost<00:02:48.400> two<00:02:48.670> hours<00:02:49.950> covered<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.070> majority<00:02:51.610> in

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
almost two hours covered the majority in

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.340 
almost two hours covered the majority in
the<00:02:51.790> bedrock<00:02:53.070> obviously<00:02:54.070> any<00:02:54.220> paid<00:02:54.519> gravels

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
the bedrock obviously any paid gravels

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.199 
the bedrock obviously any paid gravels
it's<00:02:56.350> too<00:02:56.500> far<00:02:56.769> down<00:02:56.800> under<00:02:57.489> the<00:02:57.610> gravel<00:02:58.030> layer

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
it's too far down under the gravel layer

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:59.880 
it's too far down under the gravel layer
the<00:02:58.870> guy<00:02:59.050> would<00:02:59.230> have<00:02:59.260> to<00:02:59.350> use<00:02:59.590> a<00:02:59.620> suction

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
the guy would have to use a suction

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.890 
the guy would have to use a suction
dredge

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
dredge

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:08.699 
dredge
so<00:03:02.620> yes<00:03:02.769> time<00:03:03.220> for<00:03:03.459> being<00:03:03.610> move<00:03:03.879> on<00:03:07.560> okay<00:03:08.560> I'm

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
so yes time for being move on okay I'm

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.920 
so yes time for being move on okay I'm
going<00:03:08.830> to<00:03:08.890> show<00:03:08.950> you<00:03:09.040> guys<00:03:09.310> a<00:03:09.730> little<00:03:10.150> trick<00:03:10.629> on

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
going to show you guys a little trick on

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:17.360 
going to show you guys a little trick on
how<00:03:11.410> to<00:03:11.470> read<00:03:11.739> a<00:03:11.769> river<00:03:12.069> just<00:03:12.970> using<00:03:13.360> sticks

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:27.140 

chuck<00:03:18.370> them<00:03:18.519> out<00:03:20.160> random<00:03:21.160> spots<00:03:21.519> in<00:03:21.910> the<00:03:22.000> creek

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.030 

and<00:03:27.540> then<00:03:27.810> just<00:03:28.019> watch<00:03:28.200> them<00:03:28.409> float<00:03:28.590> down<00:03:28.860> the

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
and then just watch them float down the

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.630 
and then just watch them float down the
river<00:03:29.690> and<00:03:30.690> see<00:03:30.900> where<00:03:31.110> they<00:03:31.260> all<00:03:31.640> cost

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
river and see where they all cost

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.759 
river and see where they all cost
Hawaiian<00:03:33.090> maybe<00:03:34.080> they<00:03:34.260> are<00:03:34.349> all<00:03:34.560> pretty

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
Hawaiian maybe they are all pretty

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.039 
Hawaiian maybe they are all pretty
spread<00:03:35.190> out<00:03:35.450> and<00:03:36.450> they're<00:03:36.599> all<00:03:36.750> pulling

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
spread out and they're all pulling

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:42.350 
spread out and they're all pulling
together<00:03:38.000> they're<00:03:39.000> all<00:03:39.030> falling<00:03:39.480> a<00:03:41.090> line<00:03:42.090> of

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
together they're all falling a line of

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.130 
together they're all falling a line of
about<00:03:42.659> two<00:03:43.140> feet<00:03:43.349> wide<00:03:45.920> okay<00:03:46.920> so<00:03:47.519> after<00:03:47.760> both

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
about two feet wide okay so after both

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.229 
about two feet wide okay so after both
six<00:03:49.140> hours<00:03:49.590> of<00:03:49.829> snaking<00:03:50.280> and<00:03:50.459> almost<00:03:50.819> finding

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
six hours of snaking and almost finding

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.899 
six hours of snaking and almost finding
nothing<00:03:51.629> oh<00:03:53.840> yeah<00:03:55.190> come<00:03:56.190> across<00:03:56.549> another
