00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.370
 now let's see the pruning of 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.279
 a particular non-flowering rose here 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:21.279
 it is a gallic rose is the rose 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:24.580
 purple was often found in galic roses 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:27.699
 articulate when they have one 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:30.340
 branching so you are from the base 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.860
 the leaves inside the stop 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.420
 first thing to do before by 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.970
 begin pruning to do one 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.230
 cleaning of the base so as to see the 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.230
 departure of all branches 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.239
 the rose is very thick and will go 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.570
 lightened to the particular center where 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:56.670
 we see old branches being present 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:59.469
 I try to thin out to remove what 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:08.550
 dry what is thin makes it into 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:14.530
 half see that it is a plant that 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:17.200
 rather laborious because the branches are 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.630
 but rent is a good sign of 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.200
 health if the plant so many new names 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:27.340
 so here you see these spurs here that 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:32.170
 they are lateral and at the base of the plant 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:35.560
 they will make the flowers in the lower part these 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:39.910
 spurs will do missions in the somewhat part 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:43.569
 higher because you practically have to 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:46.000
 think that these roses bloom on 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:47.590
 these on the gems that come from these 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.349
 spurs here 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.380
 I always try to find the gem 

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:57.310
 above which I make the cut so as to 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:02.349
 make a cut as much as possible 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:04.209
 in this way the gem must be 

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:08.020
 practically the cut must be 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:11.020
 oblique so that when the water rains 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.150
 slip away from the gem does not have to be 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:17.159
 the cut never too close to the people 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:20.709
 otherwise a frost damage could 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:23.439
 them it from drying out 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:28.750
 now I'm cutting this part 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:31.870
 of the branch always disk so that the the 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.359
 cut it just above the gem but the 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.849
 slope from the inclination of the cut 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:39.250
 go to the opposite side of the gem 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:44.019
 this old branch that is bending 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:46.959
 out with black marrow 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:49.150
 which is not so positive is a sign 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:54.389
 that a branch that is going to run out 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:03:03.400
 its energy and then seen that way 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:03:05.230
 age I take these things from good 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.489
 they make beautiful new branches that 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.099
 start from the base 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.790
 the first year does not bloom but the 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:11.790
 second yes 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.870
 in such a case it is necessary to decide which 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.180
 height to hold the plant and therefore 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.579
 all these branches must be cut 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:25.569
 trying to keep the exteriors more 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:26.620
 low to have and interiors more 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:30.430
 tall 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:35.829
 as you can see a series has been 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:39.459
 thinner at the lightest center 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:42.430
 so the plant is finished pruning 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:44.769
 as I said before, the rose is the rose 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.400
 purplish gallic rose that makes a single one 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.400
 flowering
