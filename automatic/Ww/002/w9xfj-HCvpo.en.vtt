 hello he is manfred the woodcutter 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.079
 Today I was almost at a small 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:35.000
 already used small lake on the way 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.829
 and the running of it came to me that way 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.719
 an idea 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:41.000
 and I would like to join you 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:43.909
 Invite in my against zumbusch strengths 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.559
 if you are interested and want 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:47.600
 you can take the time for it 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.370
 Just write me a personal one 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.409
 message 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.510
 where I live a little south of 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:56.539
 Stuttgart about three quarters of an hour 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.879
 car ride away exact meeting point 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:01.339
 of course I would tell you 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.559
 depending on what the company wants 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:05.800
 could we do a day tour or 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.119
 be quiet times two days on the road 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.960
 I could give you several options 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.060
 to offer 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.490
 For example, we could go to Niklas 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.050
 Hut high if you have more than one day 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.020
 We would like to stay in the 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.330
 stay in the middle or we go to 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.310
 my camp can do something about that 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.890
 continue to build or have a coffee there 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.170
 just do something about bush 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.759
 chatting in the vicinity is also one 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.189
 barbecue area where we cook something 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.780
 could or just by the campfire and a 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.030
 tell a few stories 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.399
 otherwise the area offers here too 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.079
 enough beautiful possibilities for 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:42.770
 a ranger hike through 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:43.420
 unknown forests so there are ideas there 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.740
 enough 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.810
 Of course you can as well if you 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.450

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.969

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:57.680

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.500

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.570
