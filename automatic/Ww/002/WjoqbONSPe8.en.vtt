and today I wanted to show you how to
build<00:00:07.189> your<00:00:07.279> own<00:00:07.460> water<00:00:07.700> filter<00:00:08.180> and<00:00:08.559> actually

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:09.559 
build your own water filter and actually

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:11.170 
build your own water filter and actually
save<00:00:09.860> a<00:00:09.889> fair<00:00:10.220> bit<00:00:10.370> of<00:00:10.400> money<00:00:10.490> on<00:00:10.850> it<00:00:10.880> while

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:11.180 
save a fair bit of money on it while

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.440 
save a fair bit of money on it while
increasing<00:00:11.540> its<00:00:11.870> performance<00:00:12.490> okay<00:00:13.490> so<00:00:13.880> all

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.450 
increasing its performance okay so all

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.040 
increasing its performance okay so all
you're<00:00:14.660> going<00:00:14.750> to<00:00:14.810> need<00:00:15.050> is<00:00:15.260> a<00:00:16.189> wrench<00:00:16.580> and<00:00:17.050> two

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
you're going to need is a wrench and two

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.870 
you're going to need is a wrench and two
drill<00:00:18.349> bits<00:00:18.590> one<00:00:18.980> for<00:00:19.310> 5/8<00:00:20.030> and<00:00:20.420> 1/4<00:00:20.930> half-inch

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880 
drill bits one for 5/8 and 1/4 half-inch

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.990 
drill bits one for 5/8 and 1/4 half-inch
then<00:00:22.880> lastly<00:00:23.630> you<00:00:23.900> need<00:00:24.350> your<00:00:25.220> filters<00:00:25.640> and

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
then lastly you need your filters and

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.560 
then lastly you need your filters and
two<00:00:26.720> food<00:00:27.170> grade<00:00:27.470> plastic<00:00:27.710> buckets

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
two food grade plastic buckets

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.880 
two food grade plastic buckets
difference<00:00:29.570> between<00:00:29.900> food<00:00:30.230> grade<00:00:30.529> and<00:00:30.770> your

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
difference between food grade and your

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.679 
difference between food grade and your
average<00:00:31.220> bucket<00:00:31.640> is<00:00:31.910> that<00:00:32.149> food<00:00:32.419> grade

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
average bucket is that food grade

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.619 
average bucket is that food grade
supposedly<00:00:33.530> doesn't<00:00:34.460> have<00:00:34.850> any<00:00:35.059> leaching

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:35.629 
supposedly doesn't have any leaching

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:37.029 
supposedly doesn't have any leaching
properties<00:00:36.109> to<00:00:36.319> it<00:00:36.440> so<00:00:36.589> you<00:00:36.649> don't<00:00:36.739> have<00:00:36.829> to

00:00:37.029 --> 00:00:37.039 
properties to it so you don't have to

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:39.520 
properties to it so you don't have to
worry<00:00:37.190> about<00:00:37.249> any<00:00:37.819> of<00:00:37.969> the<00:00:38.089> toxic<00:00:38.899> makeup<00:00:39.379> of

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
worry about any of the toxic makeup of

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.469 
worry about any of the toxic makeup of
plastic<00:00:40.219> getting<00:00:40.940> into<00:00:41.149> your<00:00:41.239> water

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:41.479 
plastic getting into your water

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:44.259 
plastic getting into your water
hopefully<00:00:42.079> that's<00:00:42.530> really<00:00:43.010> true

00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:44.269 
hopefully that's really true

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:46.629 
hopefully that's really true
so<00:00:44.809> if<00:00:45.530> you<00:00:45.649> want<00:00:45.800> to<00:00:45.889> save<00:00:46.039> some<00:00:46.280> good<00:00:46.460> money

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:46.639 
so if you want to save some good money

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:49.450 
so if you want to save some good money
on<00:00:46.760> this<00:00:47.120> I'll<00:00:47.690> show<00:00:48.019> you<00:00:48.079> how<00:00:48.289> it<00:00:48.379> works<00:00:48.589> now

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
on this I'll show you how it works now

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.919 
on this I'll show you how it works now
this<00:00:49.639> is<00:00:49.760> a<00:00:49.789> really<00:00:50.179> simple<00:00:50.359> construction

00:00:50.919 --> 00:00:50.929 
this is a really simple construction

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:53.889 
this is a really simple construction
it's<00:00:51.469> just<00:00:51.829> made<00:00:52.010> of<00:00:52.219> two<00:00:52.579> buckets<00:00:53.089> and<00:00:53.600> then

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
it's just made of two buckets and then

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.979 
it's just made of two buckets and then
you<00:00:54.469> have<00:00:54.620> to<00:00:54.769> order<00:00:54.920> a<00:00:55.100> spigot<00:00:55.780> or<00:00:56.780> you<00:00:56.839> could

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
you have to order a spigot or you could

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:58.750 
you have to order a spigot or you could
pick<00:00:57.109> one<00:00:57.289> of<00:00:57.409> these<00:00:57.530> up<00:00:57.799> at<00:00:58.069> you<00:00:58.609> know<00:00:58.729> a

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
pick one of these up at you know a

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.879 
pick one of these up at you know a
home-improvement<00:00:59.479> store<00:01:00.109> for<00:01:00.350> super<00:01:00.649> cheap

that's<00:01:01.639> going<00:01:01.850> to<00:01:01.909> be<00:01:02.089> a<00:01:02.299> 5/8<00:01:03.199> inch<00:01:03.229> hole<00:01:04.129> that

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
that's going to be a 5/8 inch hole that

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.820 
that's going to be a 5/8 inch hole that
you<00:01:04.549> drill<00:01:04.790> in<00:01:04.909> the<00:01:04.970> bucket<00:01:05.740> now<00:01:06.740> the

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
you drill in the bucket now the

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.820 
you drill in the bucket now the
interesting<00:01:07.190> part<00:01:07.610> is<00:01:07.790> inside<00:01:08.590> here's<00:01:09.590> my

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
interesting part is inside here's my

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.030 
interesting part is inside here's my
filters<00:01:10.510> sometimes<00:01:11.510> these<00:01:11.840> will<00:01:12.380> have<00:01:12.560> four

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
filters sometimes these will have four

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.300 
filters sometimes these will have four
filter<00:01:13.970> units<00:01:14.330> in<00:01:14.480> here<00:01:14.800> and<00:01:15.800> then<00:01:15.980> that<00:01:16.160> would

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
filter units in here and then that would

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.280 
filter units in here and then that would
cost<00:01:16.490> you<00:01:16.730> a<00:01:16.760> bit<00:01:17.000> more<00:01:17.030> the<00:01:17.780> pair<00:01:18.020> of<00:01:18.140> these

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
cost you a bit more the pair of these

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.280 
cost you a bit more the pair of these
these<00:01:18.920> were<00:01:19.160> about<00:01:19.490> fifty<00:01:20.150> each<00:01:20.360> and<00:01:20.720> these

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
these were about fifty each and these

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.430 
these were about fifty each and these
are<00:01:21.590> super<00:01:22.400> high<00:01:22.520> quality<00:01:22.930> carbon<00:01:23.930> filters

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
are super high quality carbon filters

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.220 
are super high quality carbon filters
that<00:01:24.770> are<00:01:24.860> also<00:01:24.980> treated<00:01:25.430> with<00:01:25.550> silver<00:01:25.970> and<00:01:26.230> so

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:27.230 
that are also treated with silver and so

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.070 
that are also treated with silver and so
for<00:01:27.650> this<00:01:27.800> all<00:01:28.670> you<00:01:28.820> do<00:01:28.970> is<00:01:29.150> you<00:01:29.330> drill<00:01:29.780> two

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
for this all you do is you drill two

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.420 
for this all you do is you drill two
holes<00:01:30.110> of<00:01:31.040> course<00:01:31.340> and<00:01:31.610> they're<00:01:32.270> using<00:01:32.570> the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
holes of course and they're using the

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.750 
holes of course and they're using the
half<00:01:34.430> inch<00:01:34.670> bit<00:01:35.140> so<00:01:36.140> now<00:01:36.350> for<00:01:37.040> an<00:01:37.370> optional

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
half inch bit so now for an optional

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.300 
half inch bit so now for an optional
bonus<00:01:38.030> I<00:01:40.060> added<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.270> pf2<00:01:42.230> fluoride<00:01:43.130> and

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
bonus I added the pf2 fluoride and

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.610 
bonus I added the pf2 fluoride and
arsenic<00:01:43.700> filters<00:01:44.090> as<00:01:44.420> well<00:01:44.600> of<00:01:45.170> course<00:01:45.260> this

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
arsenic filters as well of course this

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.130 
arsenic filters as well of course this
is<00:01:45.680> optional<00:01:46.220> but<00:01:46.520> I<00:01:46.790> just<00:01:46.940> decided<00:01:47.090> that<00:01:47.659> in<00:01:47.900> a

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
is optional but I just decided that in a

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.110 
is optional but I just decided that in a
survival<00:01:48.620> situation<00:01:48.890> where<00:01:49.550> water<00:01:49.850> may

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
survival situation where water may

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.480 
survival situation where water may
become<00:01:50.450> scarce<00:01:50.840> which<00:01:51.230> I<00:01:51.409> believe<00:01:51.740> could<00:01:52.010> very

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
become scarce which I believe could very

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.180 
become scarce which I believe could very
well<00:01:52.550> happen<00:01:52.850> in<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.180> future<00:01:53.330> at<00:01:53.600> some<00:01:53.659> point

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
well happen in the future at some point

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.649 
well happen in the future at some point
you'll<00:01:55.190> want<00:01:55.460> the<00:01:55.580> best<00:01:55.760> filtration<00:01:56.360> you<00:01:56.480> can

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
you'll want the best filtration you can

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.810 
you'll want the best filtration you can
so<00:01:56.870> that's<00:01:57.050> why<00:01:57.200> I<00:01:57.230> went<00:01:57.440> with<00:01:57.560> this<00:01:57.740> but<00:01:58.700> as

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
so that's why I went with this but as

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.580 
so that's why I went with this but as
you<00:01:58.940> can<00:01:59.060> see<00:01:59.270> all<00:01:59.540> you<00:01:59.659> do<00:01:59.780> is<00:01:59.960> just<00:02:00.229> drill<00:02:00.500> the

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
you can see all you do is just drill the

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.110 
you can see all you do is just drill the
holes<00:02:00.770> through<00:02:01.220> the<00:02:01.430> lid<00:02:01.610> of<00:02:01.760> the<00:02:01.820> bottom

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
holes through the lid of the bottom

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.030 
holes through the lid of the bottom
bucket<00:02:02.479> right<00:02:02.870> into<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.260> top<00:02:03.440> bucket<00:02:03.860> and

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
bucket right into the top bucket and

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.760 
bucket right into the top bucket and
then<00:02:04.820> everything<00:02:05.540> just<00:02:05.810> threads<00:02:06.110> on<00:02:06.290> by<00:02:06.500> hand

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
then everything just threads on by hand

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.949 
then everything just threads on by hand
and<00:02:06.920> then<00:02:07.010> you<00:02:07.190> tighten<00:02:07.400> it<00:02:07.640> with<00:02:08.479> a<00:02:08.539> wrench

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
and then you tighten it with a wrench

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.080 
and then you tighten it with a wrench
of<00:02:09.739> course<00:02:09.979> you<00:02:10.069> don't<00:02:10.250> over<00:02:10.519> tighten<00:02:10.700> but

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
of course you don't over tighten but

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.610 
of course you don't over tighten but
you'll<00:02:11.239> figure<00:02:11.420> it<00:02:11.569> out<00:02:11.689> pretty<00:02:11.870> quickly<00:02:12.260> if

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
you'll figure it out pretty quickly if

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.120 
you'll figure it out pretty quickly if
your<00:02:13.519> system<00:02:13.999> is<00:02:14.120> leaking<00:02:14.329> or<00:02:14.629> not

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
your system is leaking or not

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.220 
your system is leaking or not
and<00:02:15.220> you<00:02:15.520> can<00:02:15.670> do<00:02:15.820> that<00:02:16.060> with<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.660> red<00:02:16.960> food

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
and you can do that with the red food

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.710 
and you can do that with the red food
coloring<00:02:17.710> test<00:02:17.950> because<00:02:18.850> these<00:02:19.060> perky

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
coloring test because these perky

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.500 
coloring test because these perky
filters<00:02:20.080> are<00:02:20.290> actually<00:02:20.560> so<00:02:20.770> strong<00:02:21.190> that<00:02:22.150> if

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
filters are actually so strong that if

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.990 
filters are actually so strong that if
you<00:02:22.960> add<00:02:23.170> red<00:02:23.530> food<00:02:23.560> coloring<00:02:24.250> into<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:24.820> top

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
you add red food coloring into the top

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.850 
you add red food coloring into the top
when<00:02:25.270> you<00:02:25.420> put<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.870> water<00:02:25.990> in<00:02:26.170> that<00:02:26.680> the

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
when you put the water in that the

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.890 
when you put the water in that the
filters<00:02:27.220> will<00:02:27.430> actually<00:02:27.820> get<00:02:28.270> the<00:02:28.420> color<00:02:28.630> out

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
filters will actually get the color out

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.810 
filters will actually get the color out
and<00:02:29.170> so<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.980> water<00:02:30.160> that<00:02:30.310> comes<00:02:30.490> out<00:02:30.610> of<00:02:30.730> the

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
and so the water that comes out of the

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.150 
and so the water that comes out of the
bottom<00:02:31.090> will<00:02:31.180> be<00:02:31.210> crystal<00:02:31.720> clear<00:02:31.800> so<00:02:32.800> if<00:02:33.040> you

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
bottom will be crystal clear so if you

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.440 
bottom will be crystal clear so if you
don't<00:02:33.340> see<00:02:33.520> that<00:02:33.640> happening<00:02:34.030> it<00:02:34.150> means<00:02:34.300> you

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
don't see that happening it means you

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.300 
don't see that happening it means you
have<00:02:34.540> a<00:02:34.570> leak<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:35.500> same<00:02:35.740> goes<00:02:35.950> with<00:02:36.130> the

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
have a leak the same goes with the

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.250 
have a leak the same goes with the
spicket<00:02:36.610> and<00:02:36.880> I<00:02:37.180> highly<00:02:37.420> advise<00:02:37.840> that<00:02:38.140> when

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
spicket and I highly advise that when

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.340 
spicket and I highly advise that when
you<00:02:38.350> run<00:02:38.530> your<00:02:38.710> first<00:02:39.960> fill-up<00:02:40.960> of<00:02:41.110> water

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
you run your first fill-up of water

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.290 
you run your first fill-up of water
through<00:02:41.740> this<00:02:41.890> system<00:02:42.160> that<00:02:42.670> you<00:02:42.880> leave<00:02:43.120> this

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
through this system that you leave this

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.690 
through this system that you leave this
sitting<00:02:43.660> in<00:02:43.780> a<00:02:43.870> sink<00:02:44.230> or<00:02:44.440> somewhere<00:02:45.190> if<00:02:45.340> that

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
sitting in a sink or somewhere if that

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.400 
sitting in a sink or somewhere if that
it<00:02:45.820> won't<00:02:45.970> matter<00:02:46.150> if<00:02:46.480> water<00:02:46.720> gets<00:02:46.930> everywhere

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
it won't matter if water gets everywhere

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.470 
it won't matter if water gets everywhere
because<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:48.010> spicket<00:02:48.310> needs<00:02:49.120> a<00:02:49.240> very

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
because the spicket needs a very

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.410 
because the spicket needs a very
particular<00:02:50.290> adjustment<00:02:51.190> to<00:02:51.340> make<00:02:51.490> sure<00:02:51.820> that

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
particular adjustment to make sure that

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.140 
particular adjustment to make sure that
it<00:02:52.660> doesn't<00:02:52.930> leak<00:02:53.170> so<00:02:54.040> this<00:02:54.580> is<00:02:54.730> a<00:02:54.760> common

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
it doesn't leak so this is a common

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.050 
it doesn't leak so this is a common
problem<00:02:55.330> with<00:02:56.100> spigots<00:02:57.100> on<00:02:57.280> these<00:02:57.460> systems<00:02:57.700> so

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
problem with spigots on these systems so

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.420 
problem with spigots on these systems so
just<00:02:58.330> keep<00:02:58.480> that<00:02:58.510> in<00:02:58.720> mind<00:02:58.840> but<00:02:59.770> overall<00:03:00.070> you

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
just keep that in mind but overall you

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.340 
just keep that in mind but overall you
can<00:03:00.580> see<00:03:00.640> that<00:03:01.120> this<00:03:01.420> is<00:03:01.600> the<00:03:01.780> exact<00:03:02.110> same

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
can see that this is the exact same

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.650 
can see that this is the exact same
thing<00:03:02.650> as<00:03:03.070> your<00:03:03.220> typical<00:03:03.430> Berkey<00:03:04.030> except<00:03:04.510> it's

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
thing as your typical Berkey except it's

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.650 
thing as your typical Berkey except it's
not<00:03:04.840> all<00:03:05.140> fancy<00:03:05.890> and<00:03:05.920> shiny<00:03:06.280> of<00:03:06.460> course<00:03:06.730> but<00:03:07.480> it

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
not all fancy and shiny of course but it

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.420 
not all fancy and shiny of course but it
does<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:07.900> same<00:03:08.110> thing<00:03:08.410> and<00:03:08.650> this<00:03:08.830> is<00:03:08.890> actually

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
does the same thing and this is actually

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.270 
does the same thing and this is actually
what<00:03:09.670> I<00:03:09.700> should<00:03:10.030> have<00:03:10.150> got<00:03:10.800> because<00:03:11.800> these<00:03:12.100> are

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
what I should have got because these are

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.000 
what I should have got because these are
five<00:03:12.640> gallon<00:03:13.030> buckets<00:03:13.390> and<00:03:13.690> mine<00:03:14.350> only<00:03:14.710> holds

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
five gallon buckets and mine only holds

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.730 
five gallon buckets and mine only holds
about<00:03:15.220> I<00:03:15.640> think<00:03:15.970> two<00:03:16.180> gallons<00:03:16.630> and<00:03:17.440> I<00:03:17.590> go

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
about I think two gallons and I go

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.340 
about I think two gallons and I go
through<00:03:18.010> it<00:03:18.070> pretty<00:03:18.160> quickly<00:03:18.310> so<00:03:19.080> yeah<00:03:20.080> I

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
through it pretty quickly so yeah I

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.080 
through it pretty quickly so yeah I
think<00:03:20.500> this<00:03:20.740> is<00:03:20.860> actually<00:03:20.980> a<00:03:21.250> better<00:03:21.370> idea<00:03:21.640> so

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
think this is actually a better idea so

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.600 
think this is actually a better idea so
if<00:03:23.080> the<00:03:23.260> situation<00:03:23.830> arises<00:03:24.070> where<00:03:24.310> you<00:03:24.490> need

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
if the situation arises where you need

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.070 
if the situation arises where you need
to<00:03:24.700> filter<00:03:24.880> some<00:03:25.240> water<00:03:25.450> it's<00:03:25.660> cool<00:03:25.870> to<00:03:25.960> have

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
to filter some water it's cool to have

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.470 
to filter some water it's cool to have
some<00:03:26.320> backup<00:03:26.500> and<00:03:27.010> I<00:03:27.190> did<00:03:27.370> this<00:03:27.550> for<00:03:27.760> just<00:03:28.330> a

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
some backup and I did this for just a

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.000 
some backup and I did this for just a
little<00:03:28.720> over<00:03:28.930> a<00:03:28.960> hundred<00:03:29.230> bucks<00:03:29.380> and<00:03:29.800> save

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
little over a hundred bucks and save

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.930 
little over a hundred bucks and save
myself<00:03:30.220> a<00:03:30.730> good<00:03:31.030> 100<00:03:31.660> 125<00:03:32.380> bucks<00:03:32.710> on<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:33.730> cost

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
myself a good 100 125 bucks on the cost

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.240 
myself a good 100 125 bucks on the cost
and<00:03:34.270> now<00:03:34.630> I<00:03:34.660> have<00:03:34.960> a<00:03:34.990> backup<00:03:35.290> water<00:03:35.830> filter

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
and now I have a backup water filter

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.460 
and now I have a backup water filter
