00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 the next step we took here for 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.639
 you picked out in the 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:11.610
 amsterdam arena netherlands dfk of 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.240
 louis van gaal played against romania 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.500
 on 26.03 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.520
 the em qualification in the group d the 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.430
 The Dutch could speak of the five 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.550
 play listed here 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:28.009
 3 decide for themselves 4 1 2 0 and 20 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:32.059
 otherwise there was once a 1 0-victory 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:34.370
 term of 2007 as well as 100 the 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:37.129
 Netherlands currently listed with 68 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.560
 percent performance to last part and 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:42.530
 about estonia 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:46.699
 Romania against the first leg 4 1 won 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:49.129
 No one is going to end up in Romania 64 percent 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:50.530
 most recently the 2 2-draw 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.230
 against hungary 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:57.110
 otherwise the 4 1 against hinspiel 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.420
 to name the Dutch 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.839
 hence the 64 percent not 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.510
 meaningful because there are two seals 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.670
 once a 3 2 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.900
 Roger plays Australia and a 2 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.150
 1-victory upper tank stay tuned 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.000
 when 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.190
 Netherlands is currently table leader 15 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.610
 points Romania is third with ten 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:22.640
 scoring points as scorer 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.060
 of course robin van persie from manunited 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:29.750
 the balance sheet of psb rafael van der vaart 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.850
 from the hsv cargo of feyenoord as well 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.230
 bruno martins in the also of 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.630
 feyenoord rotterdam 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.680
 at romania gabriel torje would have to 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.620
 play udine 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.490
 ciprian marica at schalke you have to 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:45.689
 but be hurt 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:48.789
 otherwise alexander maxime from stuttgart 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:54.490
 Bucharest steaua and brotherhood 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:57.130
 not only the otherwise scary that yet 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.909
 to be mentioned among the Dutch 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.030
 security 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:03.630
 kevin strootman jordi class and 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.630
 of course one 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.840
 are some 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:19.400
 clubs currently interested in 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:25.630
 for example chelsea and mancity maybe 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.630
 but to call angern mother and daughter 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:34.859
 after the success on friday the 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.960
 20 sure to be in good mood and become 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:39.230
 to attempt 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.310
 to create a sensation again 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.320
 but the quality difference between 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.190
 the two eleven is just way too big 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:49.430
 and despite the big failures 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.730
 In many failures of the Elftal 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.379
 I think that the Dutch 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.700
 here clearly enforce and 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:57.700
 though with 3
