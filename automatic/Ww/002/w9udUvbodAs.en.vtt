or not correctly but just didn't form
all<00:04:09.130> the<00:04:09.340> way<00:04:09.489> it<00:04:09.850> actually<00:04:10.150> bulges<00:04:10.989> out<00:04:11.200> a

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
all the way it actually bulges out a

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.960 
all the way it actually bulges out a
little<00:04:11.620> bit<00:04:11.769> his<00:04:11.980> belly<00:04:12.220> button<00:04:12.310> just<00:04:12.730> kind<00:04:12.940> of

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
little bit his belly button just kind of

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.330 
little bit his belly button just kind of
comes<00:04:13.180> out<00:04:13.359> a<00:04:13.420> tiny<00:04:13.720> bit<00:04:13.840> and<00:04:14.230> it's<00:04:14.769> really

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
comes out a tiny bit and it's really

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.180 
comes out a tiny bit and it's really
weird-looking<00:04:15.760> and<00:04:16.389> it's<00:04:16.539> not<00:04:17.169> fun<00:04:17.590> to<00:04:17.859> see

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
weird-looking and it's not fun to see

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.180 
weird-looking and it's not fun to see
and<00:04:18.549> it<00:04:19.000> looks<00:04:19.269> really<00:04:19.690> uncomfortable<00:04:20.190> but

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
and it looks really uncomfortable but

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.490 
and it looks really uncomfortable but
it's<00:04:21.340> completely<00:04:21.549> painless<00:04:22.210> to<00:04:22.659> him<00:04:22.900> he

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
it's completely painless to him he

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.690 
it's completely painless to him he
doesn't<00:04:23.890> feel<00:04:24.099> it<00:04:24.310> but<00:04:24.729> it<00:04:25.000> is<00:04:25.150> a<00:04:25.180> hernia

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
doesn't feel it but it is a hernia

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.810 
doesn't feel it but it is a hernia
and<00:04:25.970> so<00:04:26.450> in<00:04:26.750> most<00:04:27.020> cases<00:04:27.230> it<00:04:27.950> usually<00:04:28.460> will<00:04:28.640> go

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
and so in most cases it usually will go

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.270 
and so in most cases it usually will go
away<00:04:28.970> within<00:04:29.330> a<00:04:29.540> year<00:04:29.810> but<00:04:30.620> the<00:04:30.740> doctor<00:04:31.070> did

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
away within a year but the doctor did

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.030 
away within a year but the doctor did
confirm<00:04:31.670> that<00:04:31.730> it<00:04:32.000> was<00:04:32.150> a<00:04:32.180> hernia<00:04:32.590> it's<00:04:33.590> a<00:04:33.710> mild

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
confirm that it was a hernia it's a mild

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.670 
confirm that it was a hernia it's a mild
to<00:04:34.340> moderate<00:04:34.700> case<00:04:35.060> he<00:04:35.300> says<00:04:35.570> and<00:04:35.960> he's<00:04:36.500> really

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
to moderate case he says and he's really

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.710 
to moderate case he says and he's really
feeling<00:04:37.400> like<00:04:37.430> you<00:04:38.000> know<00:04:38.120> and<00:04:38.240> hoping<00:04:38.510> for<00:04:38.570> the

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
feeling like you know and hoping for the

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.360 
feeling like you know and hoping for the
best<00:04:38.780> that<00:04:39.110> we're<00:04:39.290> not<00:04:39.440> going<00:04:39.620> to<00:04:39.680> need<00:04:40.340> any

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
best that we're not going to need any

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.750 
best that we're not going to need any
surgery<00:04:40.940> but<00:04:41.390> if<00:04:41.750> it<00:04:41.990> doesn't<00:04:42.260> go<00:04:42.530> away

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
surgery but if it doesn't go away

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.850 
surgery but if it doesn't go away
surgery<00:04:43.760> could<00:04:44.390> happen<00:04:44.930> hoping<00:04:45.590> and<00:04:45.740> praying

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
surgery could happen hoping and praying

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.410 
surgery could happen hoping and praying
that<00:04:46.220> it<00:04:46.340> just<00:04:46.550> kind<00:04:46.760> of<00:04:46.790> goes<00:04:47.030> away<00:04:47.210> on<00:04:47.300> its

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.420 
that it just kind of goes away on its

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.360 
that it just kind of goes away on its
own<00:04:47.630> I've<00:04:47.990> heard<00:04:48.200> cases<00:04:48.440> where<00:04:48.830> it<00:04:48.920> just<00:04:49.040> goes

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
big deal it will mostly go away but if

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.070 
big deal it will mostly go away but if

worries<00:05:18.410> me<00:05:18.440> because<00:05:18.650> I<00:05:18.860> don't<00:05:19.040> even<00:05:19.160> know

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
worries me because I don't even know

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.160 
worries me because I don't even know
what<00:05:19.700> it<00:05:19.790> is<00:05:20.030> I<00:05:20.060> don't<00:05:20.510> know<00:05:20.690> what<00:05:20.840> it<00:05:20.930> looks

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:21.170 
what it is I don't know what it looks

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:23.320 
what it is I don't know what it looks
like<00:05:21.350> I<00:05:21.590> don't<00:05:21.800> know<00:05:22.010> how<00:05:22.670> to<00:05:22.730> see<00:05:23.030> if<00:05:23.180> it's

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
like I don't know how to see if it's

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:24.880 
like I don't know how to see if it's
gone<00:05:23.510> away<00:05:23.690> or<00:05:23.990> if<00:05:24.110> it<00:05:24.230> hasn't<00:05:24.440> gone<00:05:24.710> away

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:24.890 
gone away or if it hasn't gone away

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:26.650 
gone away or if it hasn't gone away
really<00:05:25.550> understand<00:05:26.180> the<00:05:26.330> whole<00:05:26.360> situation

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660 
really understand the whole situation

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.780 
really understand the whole situation
but<00:05:27.260> at<00:05:27.350> the<00:05:27.410> same<00:05:27.620> time<00:05:27.890> I'm<00:05:28.160> not<00:05:28.190> too<00:05:28.550> worried

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
but at the same time I'm not too worried

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.310 
but at the same time I'm not too worried
about<00:05:28.850> it<00:05:29.000> I<00:05:29.150> feel<00:05:29.480> like<00:05:29.600> once<00:05:29.810> again<00:05:29.990> it's

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
about it I feel like once again it's

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.630 
about it I feel like once again it's
probably<00:05:30.680> one<00:05:30.800> of<00:05:30.860> those<00:05:31.040> things<00:05:31.310> that<00:05:31.520> will

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:31.640 
probably one of those things that will

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.090 
probably one of those things that will
go<00:05:31.820> away<00:05:31.970> if<00:05:32.750> it<00:05:32.930> doesn't<00:05:33.320> it'll<00:05:33.650> be<00:05:33.800> a<00:05:33.830> real

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:34.100 
go away if it doesn't it'll be a real

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.190 
go away if it doesn't it'll be a real
bummer<00:05:34.310> if<00:05:34.640> you<00:05:34.820> need<00:05:35.030> surgery<00:05:35.330> at<00:05:35.720> two<00:05:36.080> months
