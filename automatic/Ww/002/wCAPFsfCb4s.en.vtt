00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:18.980 
straight eight though so if you put the
first<00:05:17.610> two<00:05:17.850> measures<00:05:18.030> together<00:05:18.480> too<00:05:18.690> slow<00:05:18.930> to

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
first two measures together too slow to

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:32.200 
first two measures together too slow to
him<00:05:19.230> but<00:05:19.350> we<00:05:19.470> have<00:05:19.620> this

we're<00:06:14.979> gonna<00:06:15.069> do<00:06:15.189> that<00:06:15.339> two<00:06:15.580> times<00:06:15.610> see<00:06:16.239> the

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 
we're gonna do that two times see the

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.570 
we're gonna do that two times see the
two<00:06:16.539> times<00:06:16.839> in<00:06:17.050> the<00:06:17.139> bracket<00:06:17.589> so<00:06:18.429> that

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:18.580 
two times in the bracket so that

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.159 
two times in the bracket so that
measures<00:06:18.969> to<00:06:19.209> time<00:06:19.449> so<00:06:19.629> let's<00:06:19.809> do<00:06:19.959> it<00:06:20.080> the

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:20.169 
measures to time so let's do it the

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:26.249 
measures to time so let's do it the
second<00:06:20.499> time<00:06:20.529> here's<00:06:20.800> the<00:06:20.889> second<00:06:21.219> time<00:06:25.259> pause

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:26.259 
second time here's the second time pause

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:28.799 
second time here's the second time pause
there<00:06:26.529> shoulda<00:06:26.739> possible<00:06:27.219> so<00:06:27.999> two<00:06:28.179> times<00:06:28.209> okay

00:06:28.799 --> 00:06:28.809 
there shoulda possible so two times okay

00:06:28.809 --> 00:06:31.439 
there shoulda possible so two times okay
so<00:06:29.439> you<00:06:30.249> go<00:06:30.399> this<00:06:30.550> measure<00:06:30.789> this<00:06:31.029> measure<00:06:31.269> and

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:31.449 
so you go this measure this measure and

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:33.749 
so you go this measure this measure and
then<00:06:31.539> this<00:06:31.629> one<00:06:31.689> two<00:06:31.959> times<00:06:32.249> okay<00:06:33.249> so<00:06:33.550> let's

00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:33.759 
then this one two times okay so let's

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:35.609 
then this one two times okay so let's
start<00:06:34.089> the<00:06:34.269> beginning<00:06:34.389> and<00:06:34.719> do<00:06:34.809> that<00:06:35.019> slow

00:06:35.609 --> 00:06:35.619 
start the beginning and do that slow

00:06:35.619 --> 00:06:59.540 
start the beginning and do that slow
ready<00:06:36.149> go<00:06:51.599> here's<00:06:52.599> the<00:06:52.749> second<00:06:58.050> okay<00:06:59.050> then

00:06:59.540 --> 00:06:59.550 
ready go here's the second okay then

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.939 
ready go here's the second okay then
we're<00:07:00.550> going<00:07:00.639> to<00:07:00.729> do<00:07:00.879> dot-to-dot<00:07:01.740> this<00:07:02.740> thing

00:07:02.939 --> 00:07:02.949 
we're going to do dot-to-dot this thing

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:04.769 
we're going to do dot-to-dot this thing
right<00:07:03.129> here<00:07:03.159> which<00:07:03.849> means<00:07:04.119> I<00:07:04.419> didn't<00:07:04.629> put<00:07:04.749> a

00:07:04.769 --> 00:07:04.779 
right here which means I didn't put a

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:08.879 
right here which means I didn't put a
dot<00:07:04.990> here<00:07:05.019> but<00:07:05.409> I<00:07:05.759> should<00:07:06.759> have<00:07:07.679> so<00:07:08.679> just

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:08.889 
dot here but I should have so just

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:10.739 
dot here but I should have so just
pretend<00:07:08.979> there's<00:07:09.369> a<00:07:09.399> dot<00:07:09.639> there<00:07:09.939> there<00:07:10.599> is<00:07:10.719> a

00:07:10.739 --> 00:07:10.749 
pretend there's a dot there there is a

00:07:10.749 --> 00:07:13.769 
pretend there's a dot there there is a
triangle<00:07:11.199> will<00:07:11.709> use<00:07:11.889> that<00:07:12.069> later<00:07:12.279> but<00:07:13.089> pretend

00:07:13.769 --> 00:07:13.779 
triangle will use that later but pretend

00:07:13.779 --> 00:07:15.689 
triangle will use that later but pretend
there's<00:07:13.929> a<00:07:13.959> dot<00:07:14.259> right<00:07:14.499> here<00:07:14.709> so<00:07:15.129> that<00:07:15.339> that

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:15.699 
there's a dot right here so that that

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:16.769 
there's a dot right here so that that
means<00:07:15.909> we're<00:07:16.029> going<00:07:16.149> to<00:07:16.209> go<00:07:16.300> back<00:07:16.479> to<00:07:16.509> this

00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:16.779 
means we're going to go back to this

00:07:16.779 --> 00:07:19.290 
means we're going to go back to this
pretend<00:07:17.469> dot<00:07:17.679> and<00:07:18.309> then<00:07:18.519> go<00:07:18.909> all<00:07:19.149> the<00:07:19.269> way

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:19.300 
pretend dot and then go all the way

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.999 
pretend dot and then go all the way
through<00:07:19.569> to<00:07:19.599> this<00:07:19.959> dot<00:07:20.289> and<00:07:20.769> we're<00:07:20.860> going<00:07:20.979> to

00:07:20.999 --> 00:07:21.009 
through to this dot and we're going to

00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:23.699 
through to this dot and we're going to
stop<00:07:21.279> right<00:07:21.490> after<00:07:21.610> we<00:07:21.759> play<00:07:21.819> this<00:07:22.179> a<00:07:22.649> ok<00:07:23.649> so

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:23.709 
stop right after we play this a ok so

00:07:23.709 --> 00:07:25.049 
stop right after we play this a ok so
that's<00:07:23.979> what<00:07:24.099> we<00:07:24.189> do<00:07:24.309> for<00:07:24.429> the<00:07:24.490> doc<00:07:24.699> to<00:07:24.729> doc

00:07:25.049 --> 00:07:25.059 
that's what we do for the doc to doc

00:07:25.059 --> 00:07:26.579 
that's what we do for the doc to doc
thing<00:07:25.329> here<00:07:25.539> go<00:07:25.659> back<00:07:25.839> to<00:07:25.989> the<00:07:26.079> beginning<00:07:26.199> and

00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:26.589 
thing here go back to the beginning and

00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:29.369 
thing here go back to the beginning and
play<00:07:27.279> that<00:07:27.579> to<00:07:27.969> that<00:07:28.149> and<00:07:28.419> then<00:07:28.659> stops<00:07:28.989> let's

00:07:29.369 --> 00:07:29.379 
play that to that and then stops let's

00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:38.890 
play that to that and then stops let's
