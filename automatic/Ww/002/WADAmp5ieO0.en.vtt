it I'm I'm marking it just about right
at<00:02:47.980> this<00:02:49.650> piece<00:02:50.650> of<00:02:50.769> rubber<00:02:50.980> on<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.280> top<00:02:51.489> just

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
at this piece of rubber on the top just

00:02:51.519 --> 00:03:01.300 
at this piece of rubber on the top just
so<00:02:52.739> the<00:02:53.739> plexiglass<00:02:54.340> sits<00:02:54.670> back<00:02:54.850> in<00:02:55.120> there

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.410 

and<00:03:02.310> is<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.970> right<00:03:03.150> size<00:03:04.579> ok<00:03:05.579> so<00:03:05.640> now<00:03:06.030> I<00:03:06.060> got<00:03:06.269> my

and is the right size ok so now I got my

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:18.930 
and is the right size ok so now I got my
second<00:03:06.900> score<00:03:07.200> mark

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.390 

pretty<00:03:19.940> much<00:03:20.060> always<00:03:20.270> does<00:03:20.600> it<00:03:21.100> ok<00:03:22.100> so<00:03:22.160> now

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
pretty much always does it ok so now

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.990 
pretty much always does it ok so now
I've<00:03:22.580> got<00:03:23.170> another<00:03:24.170> big<00:03:24.440> piece<00:03:24.650> I<00:03:24.950> can<00:03:25.670> split

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
I've got another big piece I can split

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.200 
I've got another big piece I can split
that<00:03:26.030> in<00:03:26.330> half<00:03:26.360> and<00:03:26.720> add<00:03:26.810> two<00:03:27.080> pieces<00:03:27.560> to<00:03:28.210> right

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.210 
that in half and add two pieces to right

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.290 
that in half and add two pieces to right
sized<00:03:29.510> pieces<00:03:30.500> of<00:03:30.710> plexiglass<00:03:31.220> but<00:03:31.940> I<00:03:31.970> got<00:03:32.150> my

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
sized pieces of plexiglass but I got my

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.830 
sized pieces of plexiglass but I got my
1<00:03:32.480> i'm<00:03:32.690> going<00:03:32.750> to<00:03:32.870> work<00:03:33.020> on<00:03:33.200> right<00:03:33.380> now<00:03:33.410> and

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
1 i'm going to work on right now and

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.320 
1 i'm going to work on right now and
sometimes<00:03:35.840> when<00:03:36.020> you're<00:03:36.170> gluing<00:03:36.290> is<00:03:36.680> in<00:03:37.330> you

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
sometimes when you're gluing is in you

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.040 
sometimes when you're gluing is in you
will<00:03:38.540> screw<00:03:38.900> it<00:03:39.050> up<00:03:39.550> so<00:03:40.550> now<00:03:40.870> take<00:03:41.870> your

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
will screw it up so now take your

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:48.400 
will screw it up so now take your
plexiglass<00:03:43.450> put<00:03:44.450> it<00:03:44.570> behind<00:03:46.210> the<00:03:47.210> hole<00:03:47.450> as<00:03:47.750> you

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
plexiglass put it behind the hole as you

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.840 
plexiglass put it behind the hole as you
can<00:03:48.560> see<00:03:49.780> it<00:03:51.010> it's<00:03:52.010> hard<00:03:52.370> to<00:03:52.460> get<00:03:52.640> this<00:03:52.790> a

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
can see it it's hard to get this a

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.810 
can see it it's hard to get this a
perfect<00:03:53.120> fit<00:03:53.570> ok<00:03:54.310> you're<00:03:55.310> going<00:03:55.520> to<00:03:55.610> see<00:03:55.790> a

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
perfect fit ok you're going to see a

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.960 
perfect fit ok you're going to see a
little<00:03:55.970> bit<00:03:56.090> of<00:03:56.180> a<00:03:56.300> gap<00:03:56.480> at<00:03:56.660> the<00:03:56.690> bottom<00:03:56.780> but

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
little bit of a gap at the bottom but

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:04.900 
little bit of a gap at the bottom but
that's<00:03:58.970> why<00:03:59.390> i<00:04:00.700> bought<00:04:02.650> the<00:04:03.650> plumbing<00:04:04.310> amazing

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
that's why i bought the plumbing amazing

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.870 
that's why i bought the plumbing amazing
goop<00:04:05.150> to<00:04:05.450> fill<00:04:05.660> in<00:04:05.810> the<00:04:05.930> holes<00:04:06.170> in<00:04:06.610> this<00:04:07.610> helmet

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
goop to fill in the holes in this helmet

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.640 
goop to fill in the holes in this helmet
since<00:04:08.180> its<00:04:08.330> helmet<00:04:08.630> fits<00:04:08.840> me<00:04:08.959> so<00:04:08.990> well<00:04:09.170> i'm

since its helmet fits me so well i'm
going<00:04:09.740> to<00:04:09.800> make<00:04:09.920> sure<00:04:10.070> this<00:04:10.250> one's<00:04:10.459> done

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
going to make sure this one's done

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.990 
going to make sure this one's done
exactly<00:04:10.970> perfect<00:04:11.890> so<00:04:12.890> that<00:04:13.610> looks<00:04:13.760> really

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
good so now my next step is to glue this

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.170 
good so now my next step is to glue this
in<00:04:24.280> which<00:04:25.280> it's<00:04:25.490> going<00:04:25.520> to<00:04:25.700> have<00:04:25.820> to<00:04:25.850> sit<00:04:26.150> in

kind<00:05:17.830> of<00:05:17.920> glue<00:05:18.100> those<00:05:18.280> in<00:05:21.120> glue<00:05:22.120> this<00:05:22.300> piece<00:05:22.600> in

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
kind of glue those in glue this piece in

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.210 
kind of glue those in glue this piece in
here<00:05:23.790> and<00:05:24.790> then<00:05:25.540> put<00:05:25.780> the<00:05:25.900> interior<00:05:26.410> in<00:05:26.680> okay
