00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
Johnny jib which size is this this is

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.820 
Johnny jib which size is this this is
the<00:00:23.369> 18-foot<00:00:23.970> Johnny<00:00:24.240> jib<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:25.439> 80-foot

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
the 18-foot Johnny jib to the 80-foot

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.769 
the 18-foot Johnny jib to the 80-foot
Johnny<00:00:26.070> jib<00:00:26.279> -<00:00:26.460> they<00:00:27.000> also<00:00:27.210> have<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.570> Johnny

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
Johnny jib - they also have to Johnny

Johnny jib - they also have to Johnny
jib<00:00:28.050> junior<00:00:28.590> yes<00:00:29.010> new<00:00:29.400> for<00:00:29.640> this<00:00:29.760> year<00:00:30.090> it's<00:00:30.359> a

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
jib junior yes new for this year it's a

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.690 
jib junior yes new for this year it's a
single<00:00:30.900> tube<00:00:31.140> jib<00:00:31.470> but<00:00:31.920> it<00:00:32.070> can<00:00:32.219> also<00:00:32.369> become

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
single tube jib but it can also become

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.810 
single tube jib but it can also become
the<00:00:33.210> 18<00:00:33.660> so<00:00:34.140> it's<00:00:34.710> for<00:00:34.950> guys<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.160> don't<00:00:35.579> need

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
the 18 so it's for guys that don't need

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.569 
the 18 so it's for guys that don't need
a<00:00:35.880> lot<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.180> reach<00:00:36.690> but<00:00:37.530> maybe<00:00:37.980> you'll<00:00:38.250> need<00:00:38.430> it

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
a lot of reach but maybe you'll need it

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.319 
a lot of reach but maybe you'll need it
in<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.730> future

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
in the future

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.569 
in the future
so<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.629> can<00:00:39.780> be<00:00:39.930> expanded<00:00:40.620> upon<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:41.100> become<00:00:41.430> the

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
so it can be expanded upon to become the

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.750 
so it can be expanded upon to become the
18<00:00:42.000> or<00:00:42.239> any<00:00:42.989> length<00:00:43.590> in<00:00:43.800> between<00:00:43.920> like<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.489> 9<00:00:44.730> or

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
18 or any length in between like a 9 or

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.569 
18 or any length in between like a 9 or
a<00:00:45.120> 12<00:00:45.510> 15<00:00:45.780> or<00:00:46.260> an<00:00:46.379> 18<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:46.950> really<00:00:47.280> like<00:00:47.430> this

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
a 12 15 or an 18 I really like this

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.760 
a 12 15 or an 18 I really like this
design<00:00:48.030> because<00:00:48.870> it's<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.379> little<00:00:49.530> different

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
design because it's a little different

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.170 
design because it's a little different
than<00:00:49.920> others<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.460> doesn't<00:00:50.760> have<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.030> whole

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
than others it doesn't have the whole

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.479 
than others it doesn't have the whole
mast<00:00:51.480> cable<00:00:52.140> systems<00:00:52.500> have<00:00:52.649> one<00:00:52.890> simple<00:00:53.280> cable

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
mast cable systems have one simple cable

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.880 
mast cable systems have one simple cable
to<00:00:54.239> hold<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.480> head<00:00:54.690> straight<00:00:54.989> right<00:00:55.500> but

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
to hold the head straight right but

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.740 
to hold the head straight right but
these<00:00:56.160> tubes<00:00:56.460> they<00:00:56.820> seemed<00:00:57.059> like<00:00:57.300> they<00:00:57.449> fold

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
these tubes they seemed like they fold

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.540 
these tubes they seemed like they fold
down<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.109> back<00:00:58.289> nicely<00:00:58.739> right<00:00:59.070> there's<00:00:59.370> no

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
down to back nicely right there's no

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.400 
down to back nicely right there's no
strut<00:00:59.940> wires<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.480> get<00:01:00.629> caught<00:01:00.930> up<00:01:00.960> in<00:01:01.289> the

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
strut wires to get caught up in the

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.009 
strut wires to get caught up in the
lighting<00:01:01.859> or<00:01:02.160> in<00:01:02.850> tree<00:01:03.239> limbs<00:01:03.539> if<00:01:03.870> you're

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
lighting or in tree limbs if you're

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.440 
lighting or in tree limbs if you're
shooting<00:01:04.290> outside<00:01:04.589> it's<00:01:05.189> very<00:01:05.280> sleek<00:01:05.850> design

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
shooting outside it's very sleek design

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.320 
shooting outside it's very sleek design
the<00:01:07.140> strut<00:01:07.530> wires<00:01:07.770> are<00:01:08.010> not<00:01:08.189> required<00:01:08.700> the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
the strut wires are not required the

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.300 
the strut wires are not required the
mast<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.930> heavy<00:01:10.170> enough<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.560> support<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
mast is heavy enough to support the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.640 
mast is heavy enough to support the
camera<00:01:11.790> without<00:01:12.450> any<00:01:12.720> sway<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.140> they're<00:01:13.560> just

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
camera without any sway so they're just

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.370 
camera without any sway so they're just
not<00:01:13.860> required<00:01:14.340> on<00:01:14.490> our<00:01:14.640> jib<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.750> really<00:01:15.960> what

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
not required on our jib so really what

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.050 
not required on our jib so really what
are<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.619> weight<00:01:16.950> capacities<00:01:17.580> on<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:17.880> guy

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
are the weight capacities on this guy

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.719 
are the weight capacities on this guy
weight<00:01:18.450> capacity<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.200> 30<00:01:19.439> pound<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.520> also

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
weight capacity is 30 pound and it also

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.820 
weight capacity is 30 pound and it also
depends<00:01:21.240> on<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.450> head<00:01:21.659> if<00:01:22.170> you're<00:01:22.320> using<00:01:22.560> it

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
depends on the head if you're using it

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.219 
depends on the head if you're using it
in<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.130> short<00:01:23.970> mode<00:01:24.180> like<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.600> single<00:01:24.869> tube

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
in the short mode like the single tube

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.679 
in the short mode like the single tube
mode<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.979> can<00:01:26.130> put<00:01:26.310> up<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.549> 50<00:01:26.880> pounds<00:01:27.330> on<00:01:27.450> it

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
mode you can put up to 50 pounds on it

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.010 
mode you can put up to 50 pounds on it
the<00:01:28.140> weight<00:01:28.320> limits<00:01:28.680> really<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.900> limitation<00:01:30.900> of

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
the weight limits really a limitation of

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.130 
the weight limits really a limitation of
the<00:01:31.079> pan<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.680> tilt<00:01:31.829> head<00:01:32.130> if<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.460> use<00:01:32.670> that

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
the pan and tilt head if you use that

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.140 
the pan and tilt head if you use that
we've<00:01:34.140> got<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.320> 30<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:35.009> 20<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.610> 10<00:01:35.850> pound

with the shorter tubes this is a more

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
for video cameras we can control

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.830 
for video cameras we can control
virtually<00:02:12.530> any<00:02:13.070> camera<00:02:13.640> now<00:02:14.090> we<00:02:14.240> put<00:02:14.450> a<00:02:14.480> little

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
virtually any camera now we put a little

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.200 
virtually any camera now we put a little
tiny<00:02:15.170> deer<00:02:15.530> so<00:02:15.710> yeah<00:02:16.220> but<00:02:16.730> we<00:02:16.820> have<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.030> bigger

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
tiny deer so yeah but we have the bigger

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.730 
tiny deer so yeah but we have the bigger
one<00:02:17.420> and<00:02:17.570> what's<00:02:17.720> nice<00:02:17.930> is<00:02:18.170> on<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.590> head

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
one and what's nice is on the head

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.950 
one and what's nice is on the head
itself<00:02:19.070> there<00:02:19.580> are<00:02:19.790> adjustments<00:02:19.940> so<00:02:20.720> you<00:02:20.810> can

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
itself there are adjustments so you can

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.690 
itself there are adjustments so you can
balance<00:02:21.170> it<00:02:21.470> out<00:02:21.620> right<00:02:22.280> because<00:02:22.490> if<00:02:22.610> you

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
balance it out right because if you

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.160 
balance it out right because if you
don't<00:02:22.730> balance<00:02:23.270> out<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.570> camera<00:02:23.780> properly

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
don't balance out the camera properly

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.770 
don't balance out the camera properly
what's<00:02:24.530> gonna<00:02:24.650> happen<00:02:25.100> it's<00:02:25.700> gonna<00:02:25.910> flip<00:02:26.510> over

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
what's gonna happen it's gonna flip over

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.710 
what's gonna happen it's gonna flip over
or<00:02:27.230> drift<00:02:28.160> on<00:02:28.400> you<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:28.880> if<00:02:29.000> you<00:02:29.240> want<00:02:29.420> to<00:02:29.480> find

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
or drift on you and if you want to find

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.140 
or drift on you and if you want to find
the<00:02:29.810> center<00:02:30.050> of<00:02:30.170> gravity<00:02:30.290> and<00:02:31.130> our<00:02:31.550> heads<00:02:31.850> give

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
the center of gravity and our heads give

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.640 
the center of gravity and our heads give
you<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:32.420> option<00:02:32.930> to<00:02:33.020> do<00:02:33.200> that<00:02:33.230> with

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
you the option to do that with

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.950 
you the option to do that with
fine-tuning<00:02:34.400> control<00:02:35.030> okay<00:02:35.540> so<00:02:35.720> that<00:02:35.870> was

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
fine-tuning control okay so that was

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.430 
fine-tuning control okay so that was
really<00:02:36.260> nice<00:02:36.380> thing<00:02:36.620> so<00:02:37.810> we<00:02:38.810> want<00:02:39.020> to<00:02:39.080> operate

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
really nice thing so we want to operate

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.900 
really nice thing so we want to operate
the<00:02:40.300> camera<00:02:41.300> from<00:02:41.510> the<00:02:41.570> back<00:02:42.310> we<00:02:43.310> can<00:02:43.520> just<00:02:43.700> pan

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
the camera from the back we can just pan

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.760 
the camera from the back we can just pan
until<00:02:44.330> with<00:02:44.690> the<00:02:44.810> stick<00:02:45.110> and<00:02:47.590> articulate<00:02:48.590> the

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
until with the stick and articulate the

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.790 
until with the stick and articulate the
jib<00:02:49.070> and<00:02:49.310> do<00:02:50.000> compound<00:02:50.660> moves<00:02:50.990> now<00:02:51.500> I<00:02:51.530> kind<00:02:51.740> of

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
jib and do compound moves now I kind of

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.910 
jib and do compound moves now I kind of
find<00:02:52.010> that<00:02:52.160> cool<00:02:52.430> that<00:02:52.670> the<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:54.230> controls<00:02:54.680> are

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
find that cool that the the controls are

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.070 
find that cool that the the controls are
moving<00:02:55.370> and<00:02:55.580> adjusting<00:02:55.670> ya<00:02:56.150> angle<00:02:56.900> the

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
moving and adjusting ya angle the

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.230 
moving and adjusting ya angle the
controls<00:02:57.980> are<00:02:58.160> swiveling<00:02:58.730> so<00:02:58.940> that<00:02:59.090> they're

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
controls are swiveling so that they're

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.750 
controls are swiveling so that they're
always<00:02:59.450> looking<00:02:59.840> at<00:03:00.200> your<00:03:00.350> face<00:03:00.650> and<00:03:01.070> you're

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
always looking at your face and you're

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.540 
always looking at your face and you're
not<00:03:01.940> having<00:03:02.240> to<00:03:02.480> reach<00:03:02.720> an<00:03:03.550> uncomfortable

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
not having to reach an uncomfortable

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.110 
not having to reach an uncomfortable
position<00:03:05.120> to<00:03:05.780> control<00:03:06.200> it<00:03:06.440> so<00:03:07.160> they<00:03:07.370> swivel<00:03:07.730> as

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
position to control it so they swivel as

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.170 
position to control it so they swivel as
you<00:03:08.300> operate<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.870> jib<00:03:09.080> up<00:03:09.260> and<00:03:09.470> down<00:03:10.060> you<00:03:11.060> need

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
you operate the jib up and down you need

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.560 
you operate the jib up and down you need
to<00:03:11.360> be<00:03:11.620> really<00:03:12.620> fit<00:03:13.040> like<00:03:13.730> 400-pound

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
to be really fit like 400-pound

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.509 
to be really fit like 400-pound
bench-pressing<00:03:15.170> to<00:03:15.650> put<00:03:16.190> this<00:03:16.310> together

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
bench-pressing to put this together

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.690 
bench-pressing to put this together
right<00:03:17.030> actually<00:03:17.900> to<00:03:18.050> operate<00:03:18.590> it<00:03:18.800> right<00:03:19.340> it's

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
right actually to operate it right it's

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.640 
right actually to operate it right it's
completely<00:03:19.940> balanced<00:03:20.810> so<00:03:20.989> you<00:03:21.050> can<00:03:21.320> operate

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
completely balanced so you can operate

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.190 
completely balanced so you can operate
it<00:03:21.890> just<00:03:22.100> with<00:03:22.280> your<00:03:22.459> fingertip<00:03:23.000> and<00:03:23.720> when<00:03:24.170> a

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
it just with your fingertip and when a

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.430 
it just with your fingertip and when a
jib<00:03:24.530> is<00:03:24.709> perfectly<00:03:25.190> balanced<00:03:25.820> like<00:03:25.970> this

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
jib is perfectly balanced like this

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.229 
jib is perfectly balanced like this
requires<00:03:27.440> no<00:03:27.800> effort<00:03:28.430> at<00:03:28.519> all<00:03:28.670> I<00:03:28.730> think<00:03:29.090> you

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
requires no effort at all I think you

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:30.850 
requires no effort at all I think you
could<00:03:29.420> even<00:03:29.660> operate<00:03:30.019> it<00:03:30.170> Steve<00:03:30.440> oh<00:03:30.560> maybe

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
could even operate it Steve oh maybe

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.410 
could even operate it Steve oh maybe
that'd<00:03:31.220> be<00:03:31.370> great<00:03:31.580> we're<00:03:31.910> not<00:03:32.060> putting<00:03:32.209> it

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
that'd be great we're not putting it

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.810 
that'd be great we're not putting it
together<00:03:32.709> can<00:03:33.709> I<00:03:33.830> can<00:03:34.130> I<00:03:34.220> jump<00:03:34.430> in<00:03:34.550> and<00:03:34.610> operate

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
together can I can I jump in and operate

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.970 
together can I can I jump in and operate
which<00:03:35.239> is<00:03:35.360> I'm<00:03:35.780> gonna<00:03:35.900> love<00:03:36.200> this<00:03:37.180> all<00:03:38.180> right
