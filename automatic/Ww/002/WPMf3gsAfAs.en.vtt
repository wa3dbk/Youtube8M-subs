 oh my god I ask not about miracles and not about 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.290
 mirage 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:21.520
 about the strength of each day teach me art 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.520
 small steps 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.470
 make me observant and resourceful 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:30.300
 so that the diversity of everyday life on time 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:34.780
 dwell on discoveries and experiences 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.050
 who excited me teach me 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:41.470
 properly manage my time 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.750
 give me a fine sense of life to 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.350
 distinguish primary from 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.350
 secondary 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:54.050
 I ask for the strength of abstinence and measures to 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:57.020
 I never fluttered and slipped 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.910
 but reasonably planned for the day to 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.790
 see tops and gave 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:05.590
 and at least sometimes would find time for 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.590
 enjoyment of art 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.729
 help me understand that dreams can't 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.090
 to be of help 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.659
 no dreams of the past no dreams of the future 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:20.619
 help me to be here and now and 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:23.929
 perceive this moment as the most important 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:27.229
 save me from the naive belief that everything is in 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:30.350
 my life should be smooth give me 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:33.289
 clear awareness of the difficulty 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:37.039
 defeat falls and failures are 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:40.869
 only a natural part of life 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:44.030
 thanks to which we grow and vision 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.159
 remind me that the heart often argues with 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.409
 by reason 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:52.340
 send me at the right moment someone from 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:56.360

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:33.049
 to reach those who are just below
