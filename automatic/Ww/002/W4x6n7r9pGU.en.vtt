really hear myself think at times

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.830 
really hear myself think at times
because<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.910> was<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.120> loud<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.480> there<00:00:36.630> but

because it was so loud of there but

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.069 
because it was so loud of there but
obviously<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.649> was<00:00:38.210> ended<00:00:39.210> up<00:00:39.329> being<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.660> record

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079

US Open which is cool and but yeah it
was<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.879> shame<00:00:45.360> but<00:00:45.510> in<00:00:45.629> women<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.440> be<00:00:46.530> honest

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
was a shame but in women to be honest

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.860 
was a shame but in women to be honest
once<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:47.039> left<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.550> cotton<00:00:47.940> well<00:00:48.270> we<00:00:48.390> both<00:00:48.570> left

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
once I left the cotton well we both left

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.750 
once I left the cotton well we both left
and<00:00:49.079> got<00:00:49.379> changed<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.010> whatever<00:00:50.340> else<00:00:50.460> and

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
and got changed and whatever else and

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.060 
and got changed and whatever else and
came<00:00:51.059> back<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.480> sat<00:00:51.660> down<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:52.079> for<00:00:52.920> some

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
came back and sat down it for some

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.939 
came back and sat down it for some
reason<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.370> didn't<00:00:53.610> find<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.350> too<00:00:55.350> difficult<00:00:55.379> to

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
reason I didn't find it too difficult to

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.639 
reason I didn't find it too difficult to
stay<00:00:56.219> mentally<00:00:57.000> strong<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.570> knew<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:57.899> if<00:00:58.500> I

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
stay mentally strong I knew that if I

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.200 
stay mentally strong I knew that if I
was<00:00:58.770> going<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:58.980> have<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.160> chance<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.000> win<00:01:00.180> a

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
was going to have a chance to win a

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.360 
was going to have a chance to win a
match<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.600> had<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.320> do<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.190> was

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
match I had to do that so it was

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.450 
match I had to do that so it was
basically<00:01:02.609> do<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.539> maybe<00:01:04.110> we<00:01:04.409> don't<00:01:05.100> do<00:01:05.309> it

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
basically do it and maybe we don't do it

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.690 
basically do it and maybe we don't do it
and<00:01:05.610> more<00:01:06.240> than<00:01:06.270> likely<00:01:06.420> lose<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.580> you<00:01:08.580> know<00:01:08.670> I

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
and more than likely lose so you know I

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.609 
and more than likely lose so you know I
just<00:01:08.760> came<00:01:09.150> back<00:01:09.299> out<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.570> thought<00:01:10.560> about

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
just came back out and thought about

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.190 
just came back out and thought about
what<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.010> had<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.220> do<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:12.150> guess<00:01:12.330> process

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
what I had to do and I guess process

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.249 
what I had to do and I guess process
that<00:01:13.500> disappointment<00:01:14.100> well<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:15.140> you<00:01:16.140> know<00:01:16.229> I

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
that disappointment well and you know I

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.899 
that disappointment well and you know I
thought<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.680> okay<00:01:16.950> how<00:01:17.400> am<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.549> going<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.729> play

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
thought it okay how am I going to play

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.030 
thought it okay how am I going to play
this<00:01:17.939> next<00:01:18.240> set<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.750> start<00:01:19.409> from<00:01:19.560> scratch<00:01:19.619> all

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
this next set and start from scratch all

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.740 
this next set and start from scratch all
over<00:01:20.130> again<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.520> i<00:01:20.700> think<00:01:20.970> i<00:01:21.090> was<00:01:21.450> able<00:01:21.659> to

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
over again and i think i was able to

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.220 
over again and i think i was able to
bounce<00:01:21.930> back<00:01:22.080> really<00:01:22.470> well<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.970> that's

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:24.230 
bounce back really well and that's

most pleasing thing for me to get out of

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.390 
most pleasing thing for me to get out of
that<00:01:26.960> match<00:01:27.200> is<00:01:27.230> just<00:01:27.680> here<00:01:27.890> they<00:01:28.040> come<00:01:28.250> back

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.810 
most of them were turning out to be when
it's<00:01:42.980> so<00:01:43.220> obvious<00:01:43.760> I<00:01:43.820> felt<00:01:44.090> fantastic<00:01:44.600> and<00:01:45.290> I

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
it's so obvious I felt fantastic and I

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.240 
it's so obvious I felt fantastic and I
wasn't<00:01:46.820> necessarily<00:01:47.240> expecting<00:01:47.840> that<00:01:47.960> to<00:01:48.020> be

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
wasn't necessarily expecting that to be

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.680 
wasn't necessarily expecting that to be
the<00:01:49.250> to<00:01:49.610> go<00:01:49.760> through<00:01:50.000> the<00:01:50.120> rest<00:01:50.270> of<00:01:50.360> the<00:01:50.480> match

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
the to go through the rest of the match

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.290 
the to go through the rest of the match
and<00:01:51.020> but<00:01:51.710> you<00:01:52.100> know<00:01:52.190> I<00:01:52.250> say<00:01:52.550> it<00:01:52.880> stay<00:01:53.060> positive

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
and but you know I say it stay positive

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.930 
and but you know I say it stay positive
and<00:01:53.510> just<00:01:53.720> you<00:01:54.440> know<00:01:54.500> kept<00:01:54.770> going<00:01:54.980> for<00:01:55.160> you

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
and just you know kept going for you

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.070 
and just you know kept going for you
know<00:01:56.060> these<00:01:56.210> last<00:01:56.420> two<00:01:56.570> makes<00:01:56.780> have<00:01:56.900> been

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
know these last two makes have been

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.680 
know these last two makes have been
really<00:01:57.860> exciting<00:01:58.400> and<00:01:58.550> with<00:01:59.420> the<00:01:59.540> atmosphere

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
really exciting and with the atmosphere

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.380 
really exciting and with the atmosphere
and<00:02:00.080> the<00:02:00.170> crowd<00:02:00.440> and<00:02:00.730> for<00:02:01.730> whatever<00:02:01.880> reason<00:02:02.030> I

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
and the crowd and for whatever reason I

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.940 
and the crowd and for whatever reason I
think<00:02:02.630> probably<00:02:02.930> more<00:02:03.200> pumped<00:02:03.500> up<00:02:03.620> the<00:02:03.740> last

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
think probably more pumped up the last

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.560 
think probably more pumped up the last
two<00:02:04.250> matches<00:02:04.640> them<00:02:04.820> what<00:02:04.970> I've<00:02:05.090> ever<00:02:05.240> been<00:02:05.420> in

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
two matches them what I've ever been in

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.230 
two matches them what I've ever been in
my<00:02:05.600> whole<00:02:05.690> life<00:02:05.990> so<00:02:06.640> like<00:02:07.640> it's<00:02:07.790> just<00:02:08.060> the

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
my whole life so like it's just the

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.760 
my whole life so like it's just the
right<00:02:08.390> of<00:02:08.450> adrenaline<00:02:09.110> playing<00:02:09.410> or<00:02:09.619> learning

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
right of adrenaline playing or learning

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.220 
right of adrenaline playing or learning
I've<00:02:10.399> been<00:02:10.580> so<00:02:10.760> for<00:02:10.940> sure<00:02:11.120> it<00:02:11.300> to<00:02:11.480> bounce<00:02:12.020> back

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
I've been so for sure it to bounce back

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.600 
I've been so for sure it to bounce back
from<00:02:12.410> my<00:02:13.130> last<00:02:13.340> match<00:02:13.610> to<00:02:13.850> now<00:02:14.000> and<00:02:15.070> feel<00:02:16.070> you
