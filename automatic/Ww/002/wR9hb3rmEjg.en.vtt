00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.160
 very good people here we are I think that has 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:05.930
 been a little bit of adwords warfare the 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.300
 I really liked it a lot 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.820
 very moved game also lately not 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.800
 I know what happens to me that I feel more loose 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.500
 I see better you know playing like that with 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.170
 skip and all the stories and good 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.270
 well the truth that I like I like and 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.460
 from time to time not to play 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.710
 because then he pulled my hair with 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.150
 the dressing rooms and things like that but good 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.280
 the truth that molded me very much this 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.199
 game and that's why you have it on the channel 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.119
 good kids, good, I want you 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.469
 comment on an important thing I have seen 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.530
 that a lot of things have come out of 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.399
 black ops 3 is already confirmed 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.399
 They are obviously saying that they are going to 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:43.280
 leave a good beta that has leaked 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:46.069
 there's little things and such and the truth is 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.460
 Well, it looks like I do not know if 

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:51.469
 will be like this with hate you name that 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.839
 it has good then the typical ones to all and 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:56.809
 all those little things but the truth that 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:59.510
 Well, I think we've been going 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.850
 moving forward we have not progressed from 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.010
 the shit of the ghost that was a shit 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.089
 tremendous then this game came out that the 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.909
 true that the only thing is quite good 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.340
 good, they have innovated 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.499
 something hall for I liked for liked 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.490
 too much with the subject of the jumps 

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:16.840
 and some little things out there and also me 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.350
 always remember that I always ask you 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:23.289
 but what I think is worth and also 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.850
 the crap of the supplies is worth and more 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:26.140
 that is to say pre supply but if you went up 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.390
 be another day supplies 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.969
 Well, you do some things until 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.909
 I know what and the boxes are cool and without the 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:36.579
 boxes but maybe you take this 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:39.009
 playing you all supplies you touch the 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:40.929
 style touches me that is the in sunny uncle 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.360
 ted or that any of those and play that 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:46.629
 happy you put no but for example to 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.549
 I do not play I play the game game 

00:01:46.629 --> 00:01:51.009
 he never touches me he never touches me he buys me 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.210
 supply never touch me never touch me and 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:56.030
 What's up 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.950
 I'm playing in all of that and what's up 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.650
 because there are guys who kill two bullets 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.690
 to put it in a way 34 bullets worth 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.540
 but they kill me for nothing 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:08.360
 absolutely nothing then clear is 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.399
 super fake gives a lot of anger gives a lot 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.470
 you anger when you catch and you see that one is 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.390
 killed false in the opposite team what 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.910
 leave the death chamber you see the weapon and 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.569
 you see there is an assistant or you see a in sun city 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.010
 or some as well why because what 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.830
 you know or directly you know 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:28.040
 So that for me, I think it has 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.019
 created a certain way that you will not be 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.420
 agreement with me or yes or I do not know but has 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.250
 created that how good there is a 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.480
 decompensation between players is 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:41.360
 huge is huge or is I flipo 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.459
 that's why many times each time I play 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.350
 of such between a game to the best there is 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.150
 one on the internet and on the opposing team 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:51.080
 in the same opposing team good with 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.430
 the sense was uncovered pampán and you take 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.650
 you say what I'm doing here if they're going to 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.320
 put one let loose that flip out a 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.820
 little bit that they are good a little bit 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.710
 be good 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.080
 so then I hope that 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.730
 so change it for black ops 3 and me 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.590
 I think as I was saying before that 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.080
 I tell you with some blinds that this 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.090
 is evolving evolving the goal 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.910
 it will be a chestnut this is much better 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.590
 game is worth it then I hope that the 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.740
 white stress be the milk have also 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.410
 had three years 33 years to make a 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:25.550
 great game and I'm sure they're going to 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:27.620
 do something cool and something low imagined 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.530
 because otherwise I will not go up 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.480
 obviously I 'm not going to upload a game 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.700
 I do not like it as well as not her skin 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.830
 ghosts and this well then yes I'm cool 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.050
 although those things do not really cool me but 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.420
 well he tried to climb often and all 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.250
 the story besides good I started 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.840
 play the curiosity or I started 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.760
 play school you always go to me 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.190
 like and all the history the only thing that 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.290
 well the one in every two things like that and 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.390
 well, they are things that happen 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.330
 games are better others are worse but 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:59.570
 still so I would molaría please that 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.730
 be a great game white stress and good 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.140
 I got hooked again and go up with the 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.010
 districts the days to the channel because the 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.250
 true that 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:11.060
 it's what I liked but we'll see 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:13.340
 to see we will see to see what happens and nothing 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.959
 kids here you have the little game 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.900
 truth that I kill government is killed 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.609
 pretty and such and especially since the 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.979
 way to me it has cost me a lot 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:25.039
 to adapt also is that at the beginning 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:26.419
 I started strong there by giving cerumen vale 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:28.699
 look, they all start to come out and the 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:31.250
 image dies one or is a charger 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:33.800
 whole and nothing else 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.160
 it gave me a rage and in that moment I 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.500
 cagas 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.500
 but good kids what I said I hope 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.330
 that a game so powerful that 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.490
 also a little things to the fear of 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.440
 the jumps the truth that I like and not 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.169
 I like it sincerely I like it and I do not 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:51.440
 like it because you get a lot of back and 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.930
 It makes me very angry, you know, or is it me when 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.160
 good, better in you, you have started 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.650
 recently to play with teeth 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.260
 start white 2 and this is the second 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.630
 your guy is always cool when 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:05.060
 change because I have seen that I have 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.860
 seen why because I've really seen 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.210
 does not change the next call of duty and 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.780
 is freaking the first change is 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.790
 hallucinatory 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:14.330
 then since it is being monotonous 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:16.580
 and then maybe that's why but me 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.870
 I like that you have controlled the area and 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.150
 that I can not get my back 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.890
 because you hit jump I hope that 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.470
 more or less control it with the 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:26.390
 theme of maps and good jumps and such is 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.790
 that almost certainly there will be 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.740
 jumps irazábal is to tell me what you think 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:33.040
 in the comments a greeting and up 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.040
 morning
