00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
released another thing that I thought

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.120 
released another thing that I thought
was<00:01:06.570> pretty<00:01:06.659> cool<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.229> we've<00:01:07.500> actually<00:01:07.740> got

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
was pretty cool is we've actually got

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.550 
was pretty cool is we've actually got
some<00:01:08.280> backstory<00:01:08.939> on<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.570> game<00:01:09.780> itself<00:01:10.229> it

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
some backstory on the game itself it

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.440 
some backstory on the game itself it
reads<00:01:10.890> here<00:01:11.189> this<00:01:11.670> game<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.180> about<00:01:12.330> a

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
reads here this game is about a

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.660 
reads here this game is about a
small-town<00:01:12.990> soldier<00:01:13.320> who's<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:14.070> battle<00:01:14.460> for

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
small-town soldier who's in battle for

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.789 
small-town soldier who's in battle for
Japan<00:01:15.030> he<00:01:15.509> must<00:01:15.750> fight<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.140> get<00:01:16.259> home<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.680> his

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
Japan he must fight to get home to his

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.830 
Japan he must fight to get home to his
family<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.280> friends<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.210> suppose<00:01:18.630> that's

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
family and friends so I suppose that's

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.480 
family and friends so I suppose that's
about<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.380> single<00:01:19.560> player<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:19.950> can't<00:01:20.369> imagine

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
about the single player I can't imagine

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.570 
about the single player I can't imagine
anything<00:01:21.210> like<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:22.100> specific<00:01:23.100> being<00:01:23.340> put

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
anything like that specific being put

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.520 
anything like that specific being put
into<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.909> multiplayer<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:24.780> that's<00:01:25.350> obviously

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
into the multiplayer so that's obviously

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.800 
into the multiplayer so that's obviously
for<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.189> single<00:01:26.400> player<00:01:26.610> so<00:01:26.970> it's<00:01:27.270> obviously

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
for the single player so it's obviously

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.800 
for the single player so it's obviously
based<00:01:28.320> in<00:01:28.560> Japan<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.220> wonder<00:01:29.850> if<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.060> don't<00:01:30.689> know

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
based in Japan I wonder if I don't know

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.690 
based in Japan I wonder if I don't know
what<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.140> is<00:01:31.170> exactly<00:01:31.590> maybe<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.310> guys<00:01:32.490> can

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
what it is exactly maybe you guys can

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.890 
what it is exactly maybe you guys can
tell<00:01:32.909> me<00:01:33.030> in<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.150> comments<00:01:33.509> section<00:01:33.540> below

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
tell me in the comments section below

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.390 
tell me in the comments section below
because<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.320> have<00:01:34.500> no<00:01:34.650> clue<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:35.100> be<00:01:35.220> quite

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
because I have no clue to be quite

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.280 
because I have no clue to be quite
honest<00:01:35.700> also<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.329> something<00:01:36.689> which<00:01:37.020> i<00:01:37.229> think

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
honest also is something which i think

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.260 
honest also is something which i think
is<00:01:37.650> probably<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.130> most<00:01:38.310> interesting<00:01:39.030> thing

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
is probably the most interesting thing

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.390 
is probably the most interesting thing
out<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.540> all<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:39.840> this<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.710> genre<00:01:41.189> this

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
out of all of this is the genre this

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.450 
out of all of this is the genre this
