00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269 
hell out of it and you're going to see

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:56.939 
hell out of it and you're going to see
the<00:00:55.390> counter<00:00:55.750> there<00:00:55.930> on<00:00:56.170> the<00:00:56.320> right<00:00:56.589> and

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
the counter there on the right and

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:00.090 
the counter there on the right and
there's<00:00:57.580> a<00:00:57.989> timer<00:00:58.989> on<00:00:59.140> the<00:00:59.260> left<00:00:59.589> when<00:01:00.010> the

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
have to do is hit X again and it'll keep

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.830 
have to do is hit X again and it'll keep
however<00:01:11.380> many<00:01:11.680> hits<00:01:12.340> you've<00:01:12.700> rung<00:01:13.420> up<00:01:13.630> and

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.419 
it'll just keep adding to it you get you
can<00:01:16.390> continue<00:01:17.140> the<00:01:17.439> game<00:01:17.590> as<00:01:17.799> many<00:01:17.979> times<00:01:18.250> as

00:01:18.419 --> 00:01:18.429 
can continue the game as many times as

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:21.029

you<00:01:18.579> want<00:01:19.200> you're<00:01:20.200> going<00:01:20.320> to<00:01:20.380> do<00:01:20.500> this<00:01:20.679> until

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
you want you're going to do this until

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:24.569 
you want you're going to do this until
you<00:01:21.159> get<00:01:21.369> like<00:01:22.270> 40<00:01:23.140> something<00:01:23.740> hits<00:01:24.070> I<00:01:24.310> think

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:24.579 
you get like 40 something hits I think

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:26.399 
you get like 40 something hits I think
and<00:01:24.969> then<00:01:25.390> the<00:01:25.630> machine's<00:01:25.899> going<00:01:26.049> to<00:01:26.140> go<00:01:26.229> crazy

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
and then the machine's going to go crazy

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.029 
and then the machine's going to go crazy
and<00:01:27.039> you'll<00:01:27.399> get<00:01:27.490> the<00:01:27.549> achievement<00:01:28.920> like<00:01:29.920> I

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
and you'll get the achievement like I

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:34.580 
and you'll get the achievement like I
said<00:01:30.100> this<00:01:30.609> is<00:01:30.670> in<00:01:31.060> a<00:01:31.560> dark<00:01:32.560> carnival<00:01:32.770> level<00:01:33.640> 4

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
said this is in a dark carnival level 4

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.359 
said this is in a dark carnival level 4
it's<00:01:35.590> like<00:01:35.979> right<00:01:36.369> before<00:01:36.609> you<00:01:37.060> enter<00:01:37.450> the

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
it's like right before you enter the

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.300 
it's like right before you enter the
barns<00:01:39.369> I<00:01:40.299> guess<00:01:40.929> chapter<00:01:41.319> 4<00:01:41.560> is<00:01:41.649> called<00:01:41.920> the

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
barns I guess chapter 4 is called the

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.370 
barns I guess chapter 4 is called the
barns<00:01:42.759> and<00:01:43.030> this<00:01:43.689> is<00:01:43.810> right<00:01:43.990> before<00:01:44.140> you

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
barns and this is right before you

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.059 
barns and this is right before you
actually<00:01:44.530> enter<00:01:44.979> into<00:01:45.520> the<00:01:45.819> barns<00:01:47.069> it's

00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:48.069 
actually enter into the barns it's

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:49.649 
actually enter into the barns it's
pretty<00:01:48.219> easy<00:01:48.399> to<00:01:48.549> find<00:01:48.819> you're<00:01:49.299> just<00:01:49.450> going<00:01:49.600> to

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
pretty easy to find you're just going to

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.539 
pretty easy to find you're just going to
need<00:01:49.780> a<00:01:49.840> melee<00:01:50.259> weapon<00:01:50.289> and<00:01:50.890> that's<00:01:51.310> about<00:01:51.429> it

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
need a melee weapon and that's about it

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:54.630 
need a melee weapon and that's about it
I<00:01:51.969> think<00:01:52.390> you<00:01:52.509> can<00:01:52.689> do<00:01:52.990> this<00:01:53.229> with<00:01:53.649> a<00:01:53.890> machine

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
I think you can do this with a machine

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.389 
I think you can do this with a machine
gun<00:01:54.700> or<00:01:55.329> any<00:01:55.509> other<00:01:55.719> type<00:01:56.020> of<00:01:56.159> weapon<00:01:57.159> but

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
gun or any other type of weapon but

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.919 
gun or any other type of weapon but
honestly<00:01:58.149> I<00:01:58.450> don't<00:01:58.569> know<00:01:58.780> why<00:01:58.929> you<00:01:58.990> would

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929 
honestly I don't know why you would

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:04.319 
honestly I don't know why you would
another<00:02:01.929> note<00:02:02.200> is<00:02:02.380> it's<00:02:03.219> even<00:02:03.429> quicker<00:02:03.880> and

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.329 
another note is it's even quicker and

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:08.160 
another note is it's even quicker and
you<00:02:04.539> have<00:02:04.689> to<00:02:05.369> continue<00:02:06.369> less<00:02:07.119> if<00:02:07.450> you<00:02:07.509> get<00:02:07.929> two

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
you have to continue less if you get two

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.100 
you have to continue less if you get two
people<00:02:08.590> and<00:02:08.830> one<00:02:09.149> goes<00:02:10.149> on<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.450> left<00:02:10.720> and<00:02:11.050> one

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
people and one goes on the left and one

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.490 
people and one goes on the left and one
goes<00:02:11.380> on<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:11.680> right<00:02:12.330> and<00:02:13.330> by<00:02:13.959> left<00:02:14.200> and<00:02:14.380> right

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
goes on the right and by left and right

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.350 
goes on the right and by left and right
i<00:02:14.530> mean<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.890> right<00:02:15.100> side<00:02:15.730> of<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:16.030> actual

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
i mean the right side of the actual

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.130 
i mean the right side of the actual
machine<00:02:17.730> so<00:02:18.730> that<00:02:18.760> you're<00:02:19.150> facing<00:02:19.569> each<00:02:19.900> other

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140
