game the panthers were down mmm i think
by<00:02:57.450> three<00:02:57.689> points<00:02:57.870> and<00:02:58.609> this<00:02:59.609> is<00:02:59.730> just<00:02:59.879> an

00:02:59.959 --> 00:02:59.969 
by three points and this is just an

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:01.429 
by three points and this is just an
example<00:03:00.060> by<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.510> way<00:03:00.659> the<00:03:00.959> Panthers<00:03:01.290> down
