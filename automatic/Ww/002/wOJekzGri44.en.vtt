really<00:06:38.450> figured<00:06:38.780> out<00:06:38.840> how<00:06:38.990> to<00:06:39.050> use<00:06:39.290> it

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 
really figured out how to use it

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.980 
really figured out how to use it
properly<00:06:39.470> but<00:06:40.130> ever<00:06:40.640> since<00:06:40.910> this<00:06:41.210> video<00:06:41.630> i

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:41.990 
properly but ever since this video i

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.050 
properly but ever since this video i
started<00:06:42.710> getting<00:06:42.830> better<00:06:43.190> and<00:06:43.370> better<00:06:43.520> ideas

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:44.060 
started getting better and better ideas

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.460 
started getting better and better ideas
and<00:06:44.240> i<00:06:44.300> started<00:06:44.540> getting<00:06:44.690> better<00:06:45.050> at<00:06:45.200> editing

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:45.470 
and i started getting better at editing

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.680 
and i started getting better at editing
with<00:06:45.860> a<00:06:46.100> green<00:06:46.340> screen<00:06:46.550> and<00:06:46.670> lighting<00:06:47.270> a<00:06:47.390> video

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:47.690 
with a green screen and lighting a video

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.840 
with a green screen and lighting a video
for<00:06:48.050> green<00:06:48.320> screen<00:06:48.620> so<00:06:48.980> this<00:06:49.490> is<00:06:49.610> a<00:06:49.640> pretty

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:49.850
