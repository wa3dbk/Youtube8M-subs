00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:12.219
 You aa you 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:18.730
 Ah ah ah ah ah ah 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:22.000
 It's been a while since yesterday . 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:26.860
 Lottery Giants Odessa Altair 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.009
 In the middle of the ashes, we got 7 points for today's game, 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:33.599
 I think I 'm going to expose the 2D readings. 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.599
 Because , 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:46.480
 I asked you to come out and give me 4 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:48.489
 Then yesterday, today, to look exactly bring the fire homreonpo Choi Jun-seok 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:53.059
 3 doubt is ambiguous as well 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:59.070
 Debian was the situation, I think this is the wave entering the day 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:01:03.300
 Looks like he turned it upwards on the left . 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:09.810
 Oh indeyo waiting Kim Director 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:15.050
 When I crossed over, I saw the cheering almost on the crowd. 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.050
 When I look at it , I feel like I did well inside. 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.880
 Now you will come out of the boat 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:20.880
 First 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:32.370
 He's coming out. 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:32.370
 Ah, four fellow bosses and a referee who does not go out for a while talking about it. 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.750
 I think he's delivering the king. 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:52.760
 When I looked upwards, this exploration was formed. 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:57.619
 Yes. They killed me . My position. 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:02:01.430
 We do not follow Rhinestone , but we take a little bit off here at Paula. 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:08.030
 You see, this is the first time I'm biased. 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:11.690
 When I look at this position, I see that I'm just going over the top of the ball. 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.310
 It's not easy to sit in front of a taurine , Anya. 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:18.680
 Location 4 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:23.520
 The person standing at the position that can see most well though is the 3 point 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:27.690
 12 4 It's crazy that you can see it all right 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:32.070
 Well, it's not exactly in our bargain. 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:36.840
 This is a very bass. Yes, it takes a long time. 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.800
 Choi Jun-seok was granted a home run . 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.870
 I'm out. 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.870
