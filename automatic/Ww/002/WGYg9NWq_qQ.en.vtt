 The first issue of the magazine includes the magazine itself 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:34.629
 actually marking the memory on 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:37.179
 typewriter machine itself but of course 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:39.629
 cardboard tissue is the healthiest thing in all 

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:39.629
 this bullshit 

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:47.289
 The recommended price is much as you can see 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:50.289
 for the first empty 99 rubles but in fact 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:54.789
 actually it should have 110 rubles is already underway 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:56.190
 markup for this product machine 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:59.499
 insert in such a box with 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.819
 every magazine they will be a new box I 

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:03.909
 I do not know how much it will be a box 

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:04.510
 worth the search for the machine better so let's start 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:06.970
 in order 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:10.900
 the box itself is still not glued 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:16.740
 on the first release so very one in the back and 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:22.590
 The boxes are an example of such a brief overview. 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.590
 all future machines of this collection 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.330
 here we show that the type is identical 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.570
 all natural 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:35.280
 turn over so tolerable 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:38.140
 aspect the next aspect is this 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.410

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.780
 speaking about the description of the collection booklet 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.340

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.100

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.580
 order separately for 600 rubles or 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.260
 buy rospechat but it 's all different 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.990

 magazine scary no zone itself i'm not 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:36.230

 best wishes de agostini can 

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:15.949
 ford fairlane will definitely give up 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.709
 I'll show you briefly now 

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:20.540
 present yourself tracery here 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.659
 multi-colored photos that principle 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.280
 repeat genes and in here here represented 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:29.000
 specifications 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:34.269
 so straight to people that's how much horsepower 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:37.250
 how much strength is everything generally standard 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:39.229
 photo ford fairlane not a cop 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.919
 equipment on it at all as a pastor he 

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:44.689
 attached to all danvers magazine 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:47.930
 here is a brief historical reference 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:52.759
 this is a car type American future 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:55.639
 police at the end as usual parody 

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:59.209
 pinkerton mouth of legends it was 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:04:01.849
 parody of different cars here is natural 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:05.319
 savvy observation analytical 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:07.879
 mind and sheer Scottish stubbornness helped 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.280
 Alana Pinkerton to reveal the most 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:14.269
 convoluted crimes 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:16.600
 where's the pinkertons myself don't know yet 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:20.800
 it is here so well 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:23.440
 subtle's censorship and so how 

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:26.860
 that we will get such a plan we 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.640
 then everyone established so the next lot 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:33.180
 programs this machine ford files itself 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:35.890
 1956 police officer who stood 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.110
 titrant police can immediately say 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.960
 I can that modelka is made very 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.780
 quality as usual manufacturer 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:47.370
 China 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:52.690
 metal model good build 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:57.250
 flasher sirens so white grooves here 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:59.530
 badges all sorts of something like police face and 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.600
 black with white but basically style 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:04.060
 classic American police lobby 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.880
 you will tell nothing very classical 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:10.150
 machine on the american police we are very 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:14.020
 good we get the machine here to be honest 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:16.060
 Oh there it feels to buy giorno but I will say 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.070
 immediately with each release they will be again 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.870
 going up and going up it happened garden 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:29.530
 legends car in service and so 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:30.210
 further and so now let's look for the first 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.250
 magazine 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:36.610

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:39.520
 the magazine we will have feat carabinieri 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:43.480
 67 years as this concept even translate 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:45.250
 did not even know plus we are offered a folder 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.380
 as a gift for storing our 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:50.850
 journals and the folder is not to 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:53.980
 inside such a cardboard and what to put here 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:56.950
 such a van offer us up 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:06:00.990
 folding machines well, that's basically 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:04.290

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:27.340
 pay attention to the back of this box 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:29.680
 show may be better as a network 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:34.240
