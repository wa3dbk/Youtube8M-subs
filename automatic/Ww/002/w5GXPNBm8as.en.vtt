across basically my t-zone I guess you

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.749 
across basically my t-zone I guess you
would<00:01:40.560> call<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.799> um<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:42.509> also<00:01:42.979> had<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.220> learn<00:01:44.399> the

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
would call it um I also had to learn the

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.810 
would call it um I also had to learn the
hard<00:01:44.790> way<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.869> avoid<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.500> eye<00:01:46.619> area<00:01:46.680> as<00:01:47.610> much

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
hard way to avoid the eye area as much

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.960 
hard way to avoid the eye area as much
as<00:01:48.000> possible<00:01:48.210> because<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.930> actually<00:01:49.110> um<00:01:49.970> can

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
as possible because it actually um can

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.630 
as possible because it actually um can
burn<00:01:51.329> like<00:01:51.960> cause<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.470> burning<00:01:52.860> sensation<00:01:53.009> just

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
burn like cause a burning sensation just

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.580 
burn like cause a burning sensation just
from<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.939> chemicals<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:54.899> mean<00:01:55.170> like<00:01:55.290> it

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
from the chemicals and so I mean like it

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.130 
from the chemicals and so I mean like it
is<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.009> cleanser<00:01:56.610> so<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:57.270> can't<00:01:57.509> just<00:01:57.750> use

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
is a cleanser so you can't just use

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.680 
is a cleanser so you can't just use
as<00:01:58.229> if<00:01:58.470> it<00:01:59.010> was<00:01:59.250> water<00:01:59.550> so<00:01:59.909> just<00:02:00.180> watch<00:02:00.390> out<00:02:00.630> for

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
as if it was water so just watch out for

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.740 
as if it was water so just watch out for
your<00:02:00.990> eye<00:02:01.020> area<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:02.030> use<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.210> just<00:02:03.240> like<00:02:03.479> I<00:02:03.600> did

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
your eye area and use it just like I did

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.080
