00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.030 
on the inside and they it gives you they
give<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:01.259> two<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:02.040> think<00:02:02.670> it's<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.969> two-year<00:02:04.040> two

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
give you two I think it's a two-year two

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.029 
give you two I think it's a two-year two
years<00:02:05.759> for<00:02:06.390> like<00:02:06.780> if<00:02:07.049> something<00:02:07.469> breaks<00:02:07.680> a

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039

years for like if something breaks a
two-year<00:02:09.000> warranty<00:02:09.679> so<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:11.150> mean<00:02:12.150> two<00:02:12.390> years<00:02:12.420> I

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
two-year warranty so I mean two years I

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.320 
two-year warranty so I mean two years I
think<00:02:12.870> it's

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
think it's

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.610 
think it's
I<00:02:13.360> don't<00:02:13.840> know<00:02:13.960> how<00:02:14.170> long<00:02:14.350> watch<00:02:14.710> is<00:02:14.950> usually

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
I don't know how long watch is usually

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.100 
I don't know how long watch is usually
they<00:02:17.620> usually<00:02:17.890> give<00:02:18.340> you<00:02:18.370> for<00:02:18.850> a<00:02:19.120> warranty<00:02:20.080> on

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750
