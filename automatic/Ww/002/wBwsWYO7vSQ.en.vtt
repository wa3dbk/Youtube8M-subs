00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.460
 hello guys it's friday like no and os 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.190
 we bring a program full of 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:15.009
 contents about the world of videogames 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.500
 here you have the most followed program of 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:22.050
 internet so good let's start to see 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.050
 this week's content we started 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.470
 the saga monster hunter will arrive in March 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.770
 next year to nintendo wii to three 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.680
 of that will be concretely monster hunter 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.090
 3 ultimate delivery that will give us 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.940
 the good thing about the game created in a 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.890
 principle for wii and that later gives the 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.680
 jump to the new nintendo consoles 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.550
 to offer a unique experience and 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.550
 cooperative 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.690
 Obviously monster hunter 3 ultimate 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.390
 brings improvements in terms of 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.280
 graphics textures environments everything is 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.769
 colorful and with graphics in high 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.170
 definition however the most striking 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:08.810
 of the new installment of monster hunter no 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.360
 is that factor as it usually happens in 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.850
 other titles but the one that will come with a 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.390
 multiplatform system at two 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.790
 consoles mentioned ie monster 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.670
 hunter 3 ultimate share a scene in 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.759
 the multiplayer mode with both wii and 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.280
 with 3ds or what is the same if we have 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.770
 both consoles or a friend with some of 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.640
 they can play the same game at 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.640
 Same time 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.640
 but also monster hunter 3 ultimate 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.520
 will allow us for example to start a 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.490
 heading in 3ds and follow it in wii and more 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.280
 late after saving it or vice versa 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:53.920
 definitely a great game to buy if 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.920
 you have with you 'and 3ds at home 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.530
 As you know, the crisis project is from 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.050
 long ago besides a brutal game 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.150
 a kind of base on which crytek 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:15.080
 is imposing the new standards 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.300
 graphics in the video game world the 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.180
 cryengine engine is one of the best 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.040
 valued within the sector and provides a 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.500
 added value to the world of videogames 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.420
 that sometimes rubs the unattainable 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.420
 for the current consoles 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.049
 but in the pc world in things are 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.180
 different and you can squeeze more the 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:38.069
 current charge to offer a 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.099
 graphic experience and a section of 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.560
 physical superiors for it to be able 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.269
 play crisis 3 the title that will be 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.760
 launched in February and we hope with 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.739
 We will need to have a team 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.719
 powerful enough to power 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.639
 play the game and brutally 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:57.859
 prepared if we want to make the 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:57.859
 graphic experience be unique 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.910
 crytek has published the list of 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:07.980
 minimum crisis requirements 3 for pc 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.560
 attentive in it appear components 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.410
 like a direct 11 card with a giga 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.780
 of ram a dual core cpu of 2 gigs of 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.300
 ram memory and some base models of 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:23.300
 graphs to be able to execute it like 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:26.300
 m radio on hd 5770 or the nvidia gt s 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.300
 450 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.950
 Now if what you want is to live at 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.930
 maximum crisis potential 3 the 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.620
 Recommended requirements are a 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:43.659
 intel core i7 2600k quad core processor 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:48.670
 or a m of bulldozer fx4 1150 in addition to 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:52.000
 a graph radeon hd 5970 or a gtx 680 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.629
 of nvidia and 8 gigas of ram memory if os 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.849
 It seems 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:57.720
 you have prepared your pc for this 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:57.720
 powerful game 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.470
 in March 2013 the relic study 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:12.370
 comes in mind in will launch exclusively 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.470
 for pc the expected companion phil 2 a 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.269
 sequel to the strategy based game 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.120
 in the second world war that has 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:23.310
 been receiving support and support from 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.310
 its launch in 2006 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.460
 Companions 2 aims to include 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.290
 obvious improvements that the 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.110
 world of videogame development 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:39.360
 in these years we do not just talk about 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.330
 graphic section that as you will see in the 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.300
 trailer is a pass but of others 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.060
 sections that lovers of the genre 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.530
 they will appreciate we do not have the slightest doubt 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.480
 one of these improvements in terms of 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.760
 gameplay focuses on a new 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.890
 system called cold age 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.320
 said system allows realism to 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.120
 when crossing devastated areas or 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.510
 in adverse weather conditions 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:06.000
 be the maximum possible since it will make 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.640
 such environments influence capacity 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.210
 of action and movement of the units 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.210
 available 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.919
 of course the arsenal of weapons and 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.080
 combat vehicles of the time will be the 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:24.240
 expected and the sound section of the game 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.780
 it can not be more according to the 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.780
 ambience 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:32.169
 remember that it will be about March when 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:36.479
 company free 22 come to pc so 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:36.479
 we'll wait for you guys as water in greater 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.170
 Support advanced games makes 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.080
 that the bet of the gamers for a 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:49.390
 Franchise or other makes sense in this 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.820
 capcon is doing well in the face of his 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:54.610
 reside and bolt 6 which will receive in 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:57.730
 brief and only exclusively for xbox 360 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:00.090
 three new game modes in the form of 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.090
 dlc 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:07.270
 survivors invasion and predator each 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:10.690
 one can be purchased separately with a 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:13.360
 cost of 320 microsoft points or all 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:15.310
 together with a discount in the mode 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.830
 survivors of errezil and level 6 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.350
 We will enjoy it very much if a player 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:22.420
 dies will become a zombie 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.670
 yes, if he manages to kill another player 

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:27.420
 human will return to recover his condition 

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.420
 initial 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:33.500
 in invasion mode we will compete with 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.020
 another player to see who they charge the most 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.330
 waves of zombies and hold more time 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.070
 The good thing is that if we carry out 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:42.260
 combos we will make to our 

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:46.390
 opponent will get more zombies than to 

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:48.080
 us the predator mode is also 

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:50.240
 amazing in him 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.760
 we will embody still like here and we will have 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.560
 that annihilate the rest of players that 

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.780
 yes we can also be human and 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.850
 try that the converted player does not 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:02.920
 we caught before the rest without a doubt 

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:02.920
 three tlc is amazing 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:10.960
