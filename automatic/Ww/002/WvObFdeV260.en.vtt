just a bit with some simple sugar now

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.240 
just a bit with some simple sugar now
simple<00:01:05.700> sugar<00:01:05.939> here<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.420> very<00:01:06.930> very<00:01:07.560> simple<00:01:08.100> to

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
simple sugar here is very very simple to

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.700 
simple sugar here is very very simple to
make<00:01:08.280> all<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.360> do<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.990> get<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.170> saucepan

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
make all you do is you get a saucepan

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.960 
make all you do is you get a saucepan
and<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.460> add<00:01:11.729> equal<00:01:12.360> amounts<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.170> water<00:01:13.619> and

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
and you add equal amounts of water and

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.149 
and you add equal amounts of water and
just<00:01:14.970> regular<00:01:15.180> sugar<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:16.500> stir<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.009> until

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
just regular sugar and you stir it until

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.630 
just regular sugar and you stir it until
all<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.240> sugar<00:01:18.270> dissolves<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:20.280> liquid

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
all the sugar dissolves and the liquid

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.270 
all the sugar dissolves and the liquid
then<00:01:20.820> becomes<00:01:21.210> very<00:01:21.330> clear<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.950> then<00:01:23.040> all<00:01:23.159> you

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
then becomes very clear and then all you

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.480 
then becomes very clear and then all you
have<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.490> do<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.970> pour<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.720> into<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:25.110> glass<00:01:25.799> jar<00:01:25.830> I

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
have to do is pour it into a glass jar I

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.340 
have to do is pour it into a glass jar I
like<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.909> use<00:01:27.000> mason<00:01:27.240> jars<00:01:27.600> like<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:27.930> have<00:01:28.080> here

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
like to use mason jars like I have here

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.770 
like to use mason jars like I have here
and<00:01:28.500> just<00:01:29.460> put<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.670> lid<00:01:29.820> on<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.540> keeps

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
and just put the lid on it and it keeps

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.270 
and just put the lid on it and it keeps
in<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:30.990> fridge<00:01:31.259> for<00:01:31.290> quite<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.770> while<00:01:31.979> now

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
in the fridge for quite a while now

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.700 
in the fridge for quite a while now
there<00:01:32.820> are<00:01:32.970> many<00:01:33.180> many<00:01:33.509> uses<00:01:33.810> for<00:01:34.259> simple

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
there are many many uses for simple

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.260 
there are many many uses for simple
sugar<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.369> probably<00:01:35.549> haven't<00:01:36.210> even

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
sugar that you probably haven't even

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.990 
sugar that you probably haven't even
thought<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:37.130> that's<00:01:38.130> that's<00:01:38.460> probably<00:01:38.700> a

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
thought of and that's that's probably a

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.460 
thought of and that's that's probably a
topic<00:01:39.540> for<00:01:39.900> another<00:01:39.960> video

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
topic for another video

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.230

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.550 
all right so we'll move on for the rest
of<00:01:42.329> our<00:01:42.360> ingredients<00:01:42.810> we'll<00:01:42.930> need<00:01:42.960> some<00:01:43.259> water

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560

I mean if I see something really obvious
this<00:02:18.930> is<00:02:19.080> supposed<00:02:19.290> to<00:02:19.350> be<00:02:19.410> seedless<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:20.610> I'm

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
this is supposed to be seedless and I'm

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.540

going<00:02:20.940> to<00:02:20.970> place<00:02:21.270> everything<00:02:22.310> into<00:02:23.310> my

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
going to place everything into my

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.830
