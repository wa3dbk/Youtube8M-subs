00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
quick was it I mean it seemed to be done

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.630 
quick was it I mean it seemed to be done
a<00:01:07.110> couple<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.380> days<00:01:07.500> well<00:01:07.830> yeah<00:01:07.979> couple<00:01:08.430> days

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
a couple of days well yeah couple days

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.570 
a couple of days well yeah couple days
so<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:09.150> was<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:10.130> fascinating<00:01:11.130> another

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
so it was a fascinating another

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.359 
so it was a fascinating another
fascinating<00:01:11.909> time<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:13.020> our<00:01:13.200> history<00:01:13.470> I

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
fascinating time in in our history I

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.820 
fascinating time in in our history I
think<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.650> think<00:01:16.650> for<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.610> formal<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.880> one<00:01:18.000> fan

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
think I think for the formal of one fan

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.289 
think I think for the formal of one fan
there<00:01:19.830> was<00:01:19.950> an<00:01:20.100> initial<00:01:20.280> outcry<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:20.790> course<00:01:21.090> I

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
there was an initial outcry of course I

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.219 
there was an initial outcry of course I
think<00:01:21.960> it's<00:01:22.170> more<00:01:22.380> muted<00:01:22.860> now<00:01:22.890> than<00:01:23.460> back<00:01:24.090> in

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
think it's more muted now than back in

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.350 
think it's more muted now than back in
2005<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.259> we<00:01:25.560> secure<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.890> ECB<00:01:26.340> deal<00:01:26.580> because

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
2005 and we secure the ECB deal because

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.580 
2005 and we secure the ECB deal because
I<00:01:27.509> think<00:01:27.570> people<00:01:27.930> actually<00:01:28.049> are<00:01:28.259> starting<00:01:28.560> to

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
I think people actually are starting to

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.310 
I think people actually are starting to
appreciate<00:01:28.860> what<00:01:29.369> we<00:01:29.490> can<00:01:29.640> do<00:01:29.759> yeah

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.710 

I<00:01:33.460> think<00:01:34.460> that<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:35.180> important<00:01:35.479> thing<00:01:35.570> there

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
I think that the important thing there

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.820 
I think that the important thing there
was<00:01:35.900> a<00:01:36.140> good<00:01:36.770> line<00:01:36.920> is<00:01:37.130> being<00:01:37.340> drawn<00:01:37.580> because

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
was a good line is being drawn because

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.260 
was a good line is being drawn because
they<00:01:39.830> sort<00:01:40.040> of<00:01:40.100> the<00:01:40.190> dark<00:01:40.610> cloud<00:01:41.000> of

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
they sort of the dark cloud of

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.480 
they sort of the dark cloud of
match-fixing<00:01:41.620> and<00:01:42.620> spot<00:01:42.920> betting<00:01:43.250> has<00:01:43.340> been

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
match-fixing and spot betting has been

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.820 
match-fixing and spot betting has been
suggested<00:01:43.670> for<00:01:43.940> many<00:01:44.240> many<00:01:44.420> years<00:01:44.570> and<00:01:45.020> here

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
suggested for many many years and here

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.340 
suggested for many many years and here
we<00:01:45.979> had<00:01:46.160> a<00:01:46.490> very<00:01:46.640> clear-cut<00:01:47.030> case<00:01:47.350> very

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
we had a very clear-cut case very

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.620 
we had a very clear-cut case very
evident<00:01:48.680> on<00:01:48.860> television<00:01:49.369> I<00:01:50.000> was<00:01:50.510> actually

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
evident on television I was actually

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.140 
evident on television I was actually
there<00:01:50.930> that<00:01:51.140> day<00:01:51.320> at<00:01:51.680> laws<00:01:51.950> and<00:01:52.280> witnessing

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
there that day at laws and witnessing

there that day at laws and witnessing
what<00:01:53.270> i<00:01:53.300> thought<00:01:53.509> was<00:01:53.600> two<00:01:53.780> outstanding

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
what i thought was two outstanding

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.240 
what i thought was two outstanding
performances<00:01:54.830> from<00:01:55.220> from<00:01:55.790> broad<00:01:56.000> and<00:01:56.180> trot

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
performances from from broad and trot

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.350 
performances from from broad and trot

you'll<00:03:23.170> you'll<00:03:23.440> see<00:03:23.620> now<00:03:23.799> is<00:03:24.040> a<00:03:24.250> year<00:03:24.610> ago<00:03:24.730> I

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
you'll you'll see now is a year ago I

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.630 
you'll you'll see now is a year ago I
think<00:03:25.120> when<00:03:25.239> we<00:03:25.420> we<00:03:25.900> spoke<00:03:26.140> about<00:03:26.260> this<00:03:26.640> we

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
think when we we spoke about this we

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.830 
think when we we spoke about this we
were<00:03:27.700> the<00:03:27.790> only<00:03:27.819> broadcasters<00:03:28.510> showing<00:03:28.690> any

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
were the only broadcasters showing any

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.940 
were the only broadcasters showing any
boxing<00:03:29.230> there<00:03:29.380> are<00:03:29.440> now<00:03:29.500> three<00:03:29.739> other

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
boxing there are now three other

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.300 
boxing there are now three other
channels<00:03:30.370> showing<00:03:30.819> boxing<00:03:31.299> I<00:03:32.230> think<00:03:33.190> it's

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
channels showing boxing I think it's

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.400 
channels showing boxing I think it's
true<00:03:33.580> to<00:03:33.610> say<00:03:33.910> that<00:03:33.940> obviously<00:03:34.660> we've<00:03:34.989> shelved

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
true to say that obviously we've shelved

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.190 
true to say that obviously we've shelved
pay-per-view<00:03:35.950> boxing<00:03:36.099> for<00:03:36.459> the<00:03:36.519> time<00:03:36.730> being

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
pay-per-view boxing for the time being

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.320 
pay-per-view boxing for the time being
because<00:03:38.200> a<00:03:38.890> couple<00:03:39.370> of<00:03:39.459> bad<00:03:39.580> experiences<00:03:39.700> we

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
because a couple of bad experiences we
