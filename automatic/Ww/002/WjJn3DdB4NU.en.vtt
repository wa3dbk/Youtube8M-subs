listened to that said we want the next
need<00:00:20.609> for<00:00:20.850> speed<00:00:21.090> so<00:00:21.480> we<00:00:22.230> did<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:23.279> features

what we try to do in this game is to

there's a trunk the way we created the
cars<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:53.250> probably<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.579> most<00:00:53.699> basic<00:00:53.879> of

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
cars is probably the most basic of

cars is probably the most basic of
modeling<00:00:54.539> techniques<00:00:54.980> we<00:00:55.980> would<00:00:56.129> take<00:00:56.340> four

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
modeling techniques we would take four

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.080 
modeling techniques we would take four
planes<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.390> map<00:00:57.750> each<00:00:58.050> plane<00:00:58.410> with<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.640> side

planes and map each plane with a side
top<00:01:00.600> back<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.590> front<00:01:01.800> view<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.850> reason<00:01:03.120> why<00:01:03.210> we

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
top back in front view the reason why we

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.910 
top back in front view the reason why we
chose<00:01:03.390> this<00:01:03.629> method<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.559> lot<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.799> the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
chose this method is that a lot of the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.219 
chose this method is that a lot of the
cars<00:01:05.159> were<00:01:05.610> not<00:01:05.970> introduced<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.930> market

cars were not introduced to the market

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.289 
cars were not introduced to the market
until<00:01:07.470> this<00:01:07.590> year<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.790> only<00:01:09.000> reference

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
until this year and the only reference

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.090 
until this year and the only reference
we<00:01:09.450> had<00:01:09.630> were<00:01:09.810> photographs<00:01:10.290> let's<00:01:10.799> say<00:01:10.950> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
we had were photographs let's say the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.490 
we had were photographs let's say the
biggest<00:01:11.610> feature<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.540> all<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.960> tracks<00:01:13.229> as<00:01:13.470> a

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
biggest feature of all the tracks as a

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.649 
biggest feature of all the tracks as a
whole<00:01:13.799> are<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.280> multiple<00:01:14.760> paths<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.479> the

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
whole are the multiple paths and the

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.539 
whole are the multiple paths and the
ability<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.170> use<00:01:16.590> multiple<00:01:16.830> paths<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.460> in

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
ability to use multiple paths and in

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.969 
ability to use multiple paths and in
some<00:01:17.790> cases<00:01:18.060> almost<00:01:18.420> drive<00:01:18.869> anywhere<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.799> can

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
some cases almost drive anywhere you can

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.249 
some cases almost drive anywhere you can
possibly<00:01:20.549> drive<00:01:20.790> within<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.360> track<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.900> lot<00:01:22.110> of

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
possibly drive within a track a lot of

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.020 
possibly drive within a track a lot of
other<00:01:22.380> racing<00:01:22.740> games<00:01:22.950> kind<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.340> keep<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.670> person

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
other racing games kind of keep a person

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.170 
other racing games kind of keep a person
confined<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.530> wall<00:01:25.950> structure<00:01:26.549> we<00:01:26.700> tried<00:01:27.060> to

confined to a wall structure we tried to

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.510 
confined to a wall structure we tried to
let<00:01:27.299> people<00:01:27.479> go<00:01:27.810> as<00:01:28.200> far<00:01:28.590> as<00:01:28.740> possible<00:01:28.770> making

let people go as far as possible making

which<00:01:33.450> was<00:01:33.659> probably<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.350> toughest<00:01:34.950> part

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
which was probably the toughest part

which was probably the toughest part
about<00:01:35.310> making<00:01:35.520> these<00:01:35.850> tracks<00:01:36.680> traditionally

actually gives us a lot of freedom to

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
year was event trees and instead of just

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
see and every time you play the game

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.729 
see and every time you play the game
like<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:58.209> environmental<00:02:58.719> reflection<00:02:59.169> or<00:02:59.620> you

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
like the environmental reflection or you

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.860 
like the environmental reflection or you
drive<00:03:00.280> through<00:03:00.579> a<00:03:00.790> forest<00:03:01.239> you<00:03:01.359> see<00:03:01.419> the<00:03:01.599> trees

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
drive through a forest you see the trees

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.509 
drive through a forest you see the trees
rolling<00:03:02.169> over<00:03:02.469> the<00:03:02.560> top<00:03:02.709> of<00:03:02.739> your<00:03:02.919> car<00:03:03.099> or<00:03:03.340> as<00:03:03.489> a

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
rolling over the top of your car or as a

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.399 
rolling over the top of your car or as a
person<00:03:03.909> walks<00:03:04.180> by<00:03:04.389> you<00:03:04.450> see<00:03:04.840> that<00:03:04.989> in<00:03:05.109> the<00:03:05.200> side

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:05.409 
person walks by you see that in the side

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:07.409 
person walks by you see that in the side
the<00:03:05.709> mid<00:03:05.919> mapping<00:03:06.310> was<00:03:06.609> a<00:03:06.639> tough<00:03:06.969> one<00:03:07.150> but<00:03:07.329> we

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:07.419 
the mid mapping was a tough one but we

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:09.149 
the mid mapping was a tough one but we
came<00:03:07.569> up<00:03:07.689> with<00:03:07.840> excellent<00:03:08.260> set<00:03:08.439> of<00:03:08.469> tools<00:03:08.769> that

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:09.159 
came up with excellent set of tools that

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:10.770 
came up with excellent set of tools that
allowed<00:03:09.519> us<00:03:09.549> to<00:03:10.000> do<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.209> mid<00:03:10.359> mapping<00:03:10.629> which

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
allowed us to do the mid mapping which

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.929 
allowed us to do the mid mapping which
basically<00:03:11.079> smoothes<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:11.829> textures<00:03:12.400> out<00:03:12.519> over

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:12.939 
basically smoothes the textures out over

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:14.550 
basically smoothes the textures out over
distance<00:03:13.359> so<00:03:13.569> that<00:03:13.810> they<00:03:13.989> don't<00:03:14.109> seem<00:03:14.439> as

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
distance so that they don't seem as

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.500 
distance so that they don't seem as
shimmery<00:03:14.949> in<00:03:15.099> the<00:03:15.220> distance<00:03:15.579> the<00:03:15.940> inspiration

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
shimmery in the distance the inspiration

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.629 
shimmery in the distance the inspiration
for<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:16.870> new<00:03:16.989> Zone<00:03:17.199> cameras<00:03:17.650> was<00:03:17.919> to<00:03:18.069> create<00:03:18.370> a

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:18.639 
for the new Zone cameras was to create a

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:20.219 
for the new Zone cameras was to create a
movie<00:03:19.000> like<00:03:19.180> the<00:03:19.299> atmosphere<00:03:19.449> while<00:03:19.959> driving

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:20.229 
movie like the atmosphere while driving

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:22.740 
movie like the atmosphere while driving
in<00:03:20.709> the<00:03:20.829> game<00:03:21.010> it<00:03:21.549> allows<00:03:21.879> the<00:03:22.299> user<00:03:22.329> do<00:03:22.720> a

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
in the game it allows the user do a
