00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.640
 hello to all I find you for 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.560
 introduce you the first video says 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.289
 hate so I realized my first 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.150
 christmas wreath and so I thought about the 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.449
 filming for you a little tutorial 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.070
 so it's very simple it's a 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:33.300
 crown that was made with so of the 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.430
 polystyrene and makeup remover 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.289
 so if you're interested I leave you 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.289
 watch the following lease 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.840
 so to make my crown I 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:48.000
 so used a polystyrene crown 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.539
 so I'm going cheated shares to less than a 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.789
 euro a pack of cleansing disks 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.910
 that it will take roughly 100 use 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:00.710
 makeup removers a glue gun and 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.710
 of course refills for glue 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.680
 I have prepared my little records 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.570
 makeup remover in the small support and 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.240
 so we're going to start so in fact we're going 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.579
 take the cleansing disc we have a 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.930
 striated side and we have a side tell us 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:19.020
 what we want is that at tennis 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:24.479
 so we'll fold we can see the side 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:26.520
 streaked on the outside we will pinch then 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.310
 I place my fingers here and I think there 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:34.079
 on the side so here's the unsa here and we 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:37.439
 so sticks so with the gun to 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.680
 glue I put glue I do not hesitate 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.680
 not 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:48.249
 and so we start like these one 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.249
 pose his parcels 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.539
 so to bread 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.930
 so i'm going to change the mans what i 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.000
 am right handed it will be simpler and I 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.450
 will respite that you see correctly 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.450
 images 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.239
 So here we are we love we are not obliged 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:21.810
 to align them we will put it a little 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:21.810
 staggered in fact so that's it 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.600
 so here I have a tiny hole I'm going 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:29.100
 so fold it in four years since a year 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:29.100
 per year 2 so on the angle the mac os 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.280
 So here opened my boyfriend 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.180
 so here I touch are the sides here 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.180
 it is still missing 2 3 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:01.450
 here is the crown is over I have 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:05.380
 used less than 200 disinfecting disks 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:07.150
 compared to the chosen format is therefore 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:12.250
 now i will come to customize 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:14.650
 makes you choose little ones from small 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:19.360
 size is heart shaped i have not 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:23.790
 big thing on the hand so ben I 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.790
 tried to ask that then 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.570
 at 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:54.440
 I will come add so I think of 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:06:02.440
 little pine cones I added 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:02.440
 only one but put here 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:13.950
 4 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:27.640
 so I'm going to finish now 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:31.200
 customize so my little crown and 

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:33.940
 so I chose it's two pretty little ones 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:39.100
 gift packages I so I'm going 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:45.070
 come stick on my what's so I'm going to 

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:49.470
 ask here and I'm going to ask them 

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:49.470
 as if he had just been dropped 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:11.979
 So here we can I think after 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:16.900
 add for example a star there and there 

00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:19.629
 stick behind short is pretty cool 

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:21.280
 I think that makes no added others 

00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:22.569
 things have little that's squeezing and 

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:25.870
 only you idea of â€‹â€‹the little balls 

00:07:22.569 --> 00:07:27.490
 or so of small garland which also 

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:29.039
 would be pretty good me I'm going to do it the 

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:33.819
 simpler possible 

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:36.400

00:07:33.819 --> 00:07:38.620
 so I hope you enjoyed it 

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:40.629

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:43.539
 so hung the little cord so me 

00:07:40.629 --> 00:07:46.120
 I'm going to stick it behind but so 

00:07:43.539 --> 00:07:48.639
 think before all before you start 

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:52.150
 to hang on the crown a cord 

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:53.530
 and then we garnish with that so 

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:54.969
