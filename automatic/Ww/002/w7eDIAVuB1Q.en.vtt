finishing<00:00:13.440> touches<00:00:13.769> on<00:00:14.009> your<00:00:14.040> terrarium<00:00:14.480> now

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
finishing touches on your terrarium now

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.019 
finishing touches on your terrarium now
I<00:00:15.509> usually<00:00:15.929> only<00:00:16.470> use<00:00:16.920> two<00:00:17.190> elements<00:00:17.730> I<00:00:17.850> use

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
I usually only use two elements I use

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.260 
I usually only use two elements I use
stones<00:00:18.510> we<00:00:19.500> have<00:00:19.529> stones<00:00:20.010> of<00:00:20.189> different<00:00:20.270> sizes

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
stones we have stones of different sizes

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.320 
stones we have stones of different sizes
I<00:00:21.810> like<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.109> mix<00:00:22.260> small<00:00:22.650> stones<00:00:23.070> River<00:00:24.060> rocks

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
I like to mix small stones River rocks

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.029 
I like to mix small stones River rocks
with<00:00:24.660> large<00:00:24.930> ones<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:27.769> recently<00:00:28.769> I've

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
with large ones and recently I've

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.220 
with large ones and recently I've
started<00:00:29.070> adding<00:00:29.869> driftwood<00:00:30.869> pieces<00:00:31.349> as<00:00:32.040> well

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
started adding driftwood pieces as well

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.709 
started adding driftwood pieces as well
so<00:00:34.940> basically<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.149> just<00:00:36.329> use<00:00:36.480> your<00:00:36.510> own

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
so basically you just use your own

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.979 
so basically you just use your own
discretion<00:00:37.940> sometimes<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.360> like<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.570> start

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
discretion sometimes I like to start

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.580 
discretion sometimes I like to start
with<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.320> larger<00:00:40.980> ones<00:00:41.219> first<00:00:45.140> one<00:00:46.140> little

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
with the larger ones first one little

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.250 
with the larger ones first one little
technique<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:47.730> like<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.780> don't<00:00:49.020> know<00:00:49.110> if

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
technique that I like I don't know if

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.369 
technique that I like I don't know if
anybody<00:00:49.649> notices<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.690> to<00:00:51.690> take<00:00:51.899> some<00:00:52.140> tall

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
anybody notices is to take some tall

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.189 
anybody notices is to take some tall
stones<00:00:54.199> and<00:00:55.199> actually<00:00:55.649> stand<00:00:56.039> them<00:00:56.250> on<00:00:56.430> end<00:00:57.199> so

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
stones and actually stand them on end so

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.170 
stones and actually stand them on end so
they're<00:00:58.350> not<00:00:58.469> sitting<00:00:58.800> flat<00:00:59.750> it's<00:01:00.750> more<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.140> a

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
they're not sitting flat it's more of a

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.179 
they're not sitting flat it's more of a
an<00:01:03.180> outdoor<00:01:03.539> garden<00:01:03.899> feature<00:01:04.409> if<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.830> do<00:01:04.979> that

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
an outdoor garden feature if you do that

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.109 
an outdoor garden feature if you do that
now<00:01:06.080> the<00:01:07.080> importance<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.860> stones<00:01:08.220> isn't<00:01:08.790> just

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
now the importance of stones isn't just

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.289 
now the importance of stones isn't just
decorative

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
decorative

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.520 
decorative
especially<00:01:12.299> in<00:01:12.479> an<00:01:12.600> open<00:01:12.930> terrarium<00:01:13.380> you're

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
especially in an open terrarium you're

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.899 
especially in an open terrarium you're
going<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.740> want<00:01:13.950> stones<00:01:14.250> because<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.760> keeps

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
going to want stones because it keeps

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.690 
going to want stones because it keeps
the<00:01:15.119> soil<00:01:15.390> moist<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:17.689> reduces<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.869> amount<00:01:19.140> of

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
the soil moist it reduces the amount of

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.140 
the soil moist it reduces the amount of
soil<00:01:20.700> surface<00:01:21.270> area<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.080> moisture<00:01:22.500> stays

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
soil surface area so the moisture stays

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.580 
soil surface area so the moisture stays
inside<00:01:24.150> close<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.930> roots<00:01:25.170> instead<00:01:25.439> of

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
inside close to the roots instead of

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.980 
inside close to the roots instead of
evaporating<00:01:26.369> then<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.360> don't<00:01:27.509> have<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.659> water

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
evaporating then you don't have to water

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:38.120 
evaporating then you don't have to water
as<00:01:28.200> much<00:01:28.880> so<00:01:29.880> just<00:01:30.060> kind<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.360> drop<00:01:30.659> them<00:01:30.960> in

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.730 

kind<00:01:39.130> of<00:01:39.219> want<00:01:39.369> to<00:01:39.429> nestle<00:01:39.939> them<00:01:40.119> under

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.639 

low-lying<00:01:44.740> plants<00:01:45.399> like<00:01:45.640> this<00:01:45.969> I<00:01:49.500> like<00:01:50.500> to

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
low-lying plants like this I like to

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.690 
low-lying plants like this I like to
take<00:01:50.829> a<00:01:50.859> big<00:01:51.189> flat<00:01:51.700> stone<00:01:52.119> and<00:01:53.369> stick<00:01:54.369> it<00:01:54.549> right

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:04.649 
doesn't get buried plants will still
shoot<00:02:03.399> off<00:02:03.640> of<00:02:03.670> this<00:02:03.939> even<00:02:04.270> if<00:02:04.359> it's<00:02:04.509> not

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
shoot off of this even if it's not

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.229 
shoot off of this even if it's not
touching<00:02:04.869> the<00:02:05.079> soil<00:02:08.519> and<00:02:09.519> again<00:02:09.940> in<00:02:10.149> a

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
touching the soil and again in a

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.780 
touching the soil and again in a
literary<00:02:10.929> em<00:02:11.290> this<00:02:11.470> is<00:02:11.709> more<00:02:12.010> for<00:02:12.250> aesthetic

that<00:02:43.959> I<00:02:44.260> learned<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.650> hard<00:02:44.799> way<00:02:45.030> again<00:02:46.030> is<00:02:46.269> to

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
that I learned the hard way again is to

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.180 
that I learned the hard way again is to
make<00:02:46.720> sure<00:02:46.900> if<00:02:47.019> you're<00:02:47.139> using<00:02:47.170> driftwood<00:02:47.859> sit

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
make sure if you're using driftwood sit

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.770 
make sure if you're using driftwood sit
it<00:02:48.280> on<00:02:48.340> top<00:02:48.400> of<00:02:48.609> the<00:02:48.849> stones<00:02:49.090> don't<00:02:49.359> sit<00:02:49.630> it<00:02:49.720> on

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780

it on top of the stones don't sit it on
top<00:02:50.019> of<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:50.260> soil<00:02:50.530> because<00:02:51.519> if<00:02:51.760> you<00:02:51.880> sit<00:02:52.090> it<00:02:52.209> on

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
top of the soil because if you sit it on
