it's<00:01:04.000> insane<00:01:05.110> I'm<00:01:05.170> not<00:01:05.409> sure<00:01:05.619> if<00:01:05.710> they're

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
it's insane I'm not sure if they're

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.039 
it's insane I'm not sure if they're
doing<00:01:05.979> something<00:01:06.250> magical<00:01:06.880> but<00:01:07.090> um<00:01:07.270> I<00:01:07.539> ain't

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
doing something magical but um I ain't

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:11.100 
doing something magical but um I ain't
mad<00:01:08.289> but<00:01:09.159> the<00:01:09.280> downside<00:01:09.520> is<00:01:10.060> is<00:01:10.360> that<00:01:10.990> the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
mad but the downside is is that the

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.620 
mad but the downside is is that the
packaging<00:01:11.710> is<00:01:11.979> a<00:01:12.009> little<00:01:12.700> bit<00:01:12.850> skeptical<00:01:13.270> I

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
packaging is a little bit skeptical I

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.870 
packaging is a little bit skeptical I
mean<00:01:14.140> it<00:01:14.319> comes<00:01:14.470> in<00:01:14.649> a<00:01:14.740> big<00:01:14.920> box<00:01:14.979> which<00:01:15.580> is<00:01:15.700> nice

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
mean it comes in a big box which is nice

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.139 
mean it comes in a big box which is nice
but<00:01:16.569> there<00:01:16.899> isn't<00:01:17.140> any<00:01:17.470> foam<00:01:18.069> or<00:01:18.399> bubble<00:01:19.000> wrap

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
but there isn't any foam or bubble wrap

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:21.449

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
disappointing because the product might

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.960 
disappointing because the product might
get<00:01:23.530> damaged<00:01:24.130> during<00:01:24.220> the<00:01:24.429> shipping<00:01:24.700> process
