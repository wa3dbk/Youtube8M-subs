okay<00:00:01.260> we're<00:00:02.010> going<00:00:02.250> to<00:00:03.170> job<00:00:04.170> here<00:00:04.410> is<00:00:04.500> to

00:00:05.079 --> 00:00:05.089 
okay we're going to job here is to

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:09.379 
okay we're going to job here is to
attract<00:00:06.089> the<00:00:06.960> baby's<00:00:07.290> eye<00:00:08.030> in<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.120> direction

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
attract the baby's eye in the direction

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.030 
attract the baby's eye in the direction
you<00:00:09.599> want<00:00:09.809> it<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.790> draw<00:00:11.790> at<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:11.969> same<00:00:12.210> time

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:13.040 
you want it and draw at the same time

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.680 
you want it and draw at the same time
you<00:00:14.040> don't<00:00:14.250> have<00:00:14.340> to<00:00:14.460> do<00:00:14.580> that<00:00:14.759> because<00:00:15.389> you

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
you don't have to do that because you

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.810 
you don't have to do that because you
can<00:00:15.719> just<00:00:15.990> look<00:00:16.049> at<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.289> screen<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.800> draw<00:00:17.640> it

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
can just look at the screen and draw it

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:25.040 
can just look at the screen and draw it
that's<00:00:18.029> what<00:00:19.020> I<00:00:19.140> have<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.560> do<00:00:22.010> and<00:00:23.119> so<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.180> draw

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
that's what I have to do and so to draw

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.519 
that's what I have to do and so to draw
a<00:00:25.760> baby<00:00:26.810> you<00:00:27.810> have<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:27.990> really<00:00:28.230> have<00:00:28.289> the

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
a baby you have to really have the

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.460 
a baby you have to really have the
fundamentals<00:00:29.070> down<00:00:30.109> keep<00:00:31.109> your<00:00:31.140> line

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
fundamentals down keep your line

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.760 
fundamentals down keep your line
technique<00:00:31.920> simple<00:00:33.020> you<00:00:34.020> can't<00:00:34.290> have<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.500> lot<00:00:34.710> of

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
technique simple you can't have a lot of

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.549 
technique simple you can't have a lot of
extra<00:00:35.190> lines<00:00:35.430> when<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.180> draw<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.420> baby<00:00:36.660> the

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
extra lines when you draw a baby the

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.000 
extra lines when you draw a baby the
lines<00:00:37.800> have<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.040> be<00:00:38.160> accurate<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:40.340> simple<00:00:43.010> you

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
lines have to be accurate and simple you

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.760 
lines have to be accurate and simple you
have<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.370> remember<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:48.559> lines<00:00:49.559> of

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
have to remember that that the lines of

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.410 
have to remember that that the lines of
the<00:00:49.890> width<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.280> face<00:00:51.680> are<00:00:52.680> really<00:00:52.770> crucial<00:00:53.670> in

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
the width of face are really crucial in

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:01.240 
the width of face are really crucial in
determining<00:00:54.800> the<00:00:55.800> age<00:00:56.180> of<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.360> baby<00:00:59.420> and<00:01:00.420> now

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
determining the age of this baby and now

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:12.980 
determining the age of this baby and now
we're<00:01:02.250> going<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:06.320> model<00:01:07.320> some<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.159> shadows

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:20.330 

I<00:01:13.760> like<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.909> place<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.869> eyebrows<00:01:18.890> before<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:20.250> do

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
I like to place the eyebrows before I do

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.200 
I like to place the eyebrows before I do
a<00:01:20.430> lot<00:01:20.760> of<00:01:20.790> shading<00:01:21.119> just<00:01:22.400> make<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.430> marker<00:01:23.970> to

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
a lot of shading just make a marker to

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.450 
a lot of shading just make a marker to
hear<00:01:24.659> work<00:01:24.900> things<00:01:25.530> are<00:01:25.650> going<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.860> go<00:01:26.220> and

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
hear work things are going to go and

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.200 
hear work things are going to go and
then<00:01:26.640> we<00:01:26.759> can<00:01:26.909> just<00:01:27.030> start<00:01:27.270> modeling<00:01:29.180> what<00:01:30.180> I

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
then we can just start modeling what I

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.950 
then we can just start modeling what I
mean<00:01:30.420> by<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:32.930> we're<00:01:33.930> blocking<00:01:34.200> in<00:01:34.530> the

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
mean by that is we're blocking in the

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.660 
mean by that is we're blocking in the
masses<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.290> largest<00:01:37.710> masses<00:01:38.070> first<00:01:38.340> in<00:01:38.520> it

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
masses the largest masses first in it

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.090 
masses the largest masses first in it
what<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.600> accomplishes<00:01:41.960> is<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.740> might

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
what that accomplishes is it it might

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.969 
what that accomplishes is it it might
it's<00:01:44.340> just<00:01:44.550> like<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.729> three-dimensional<00:01:45.979> clay

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
it's just like a three-dimensional clay

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.790 
it's just like a three-dimensional clay
figure<00:01:47.460> we're<00:01:48.360> modeling<00:01:48.720> just<00:01:49.229> like<00:01:49.380> modeling

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
figure we're modeling just like modeling

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.460 
figure we're modeling just like modeling
clay<00:01:50.330> we're<00:01:51.330> making<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.690> three-dimensional

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
clay we're making a three-dimensional

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.880 
clay we're making a three-dimensional
image<00:01:53.600> on<00:01:54.600> paper<00:01:55.130> with<00:01:56.130> lights<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:56.970> darks<00:01:57.330> and

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
image on paper with lights and darks and

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:06.910 
image on paper with lights and darks and
we<00:01:58.890> do<00:01:59.039> that<00:01:59.220> by<00:01:59.539> careful<00:02:00.539> shading

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.190 

it's<00:02:07.370> how<00:02:07.490> we<00:02:07.550> just<00:02:07.790> were<00:02:08.539> putting<00:02:08.840> in<00:02:08.960> I'm

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
it's how we just were putting in I'm

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:17.230 
it's how we just were putting in I'm
putting<00:02:09.560> in<00:02:09.880> largest<00:02:10.880> messes<00:02:11.330> first

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.869 

this<00:02:17.930> is<00:02:18.080> a

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.770 

downstroke<00:02:22.840> I'm<00:02:22.989> only<00:02:23.140> going<00:02:23.379> one<00:02:23.409> direction

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
downstroke I'm only going one direction

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.349 
downstroke I'm only going one direction
and<00:02:26.849> then<00:02:27.849> we'll<00:02:28.120> start<00:02:28.420> to<00:02:28.629> work<00:02:28.840> in<00:02:30.359> the

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:31.359 
and then we'll start to work in the

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:40.080 
and then we'll start to work in the
details<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:34.109> shade<00:02:35.109> as<00:02:35.290> we<00:02:35.409> go<00:02:38.849> place<00:02:39.849> those

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
details the shade as we go place those

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:50.360 
details the shade as we go place those
eyebrows<00:02:40.510> precisely<00:02:44.459> as<00:02:45.459> much<00:02:45.609> as<00:02:45.760> we<00:02:45.879> can

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:58.750 

and

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.780 

to<00:02:59.450> really<00:03:00.319> measure<00:03:00.650> these<00:03:00.950> eyes<00:03:01.220> because

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
to really measure these eyes because

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.729 
to really measure these eyes because
you're<00:03:02.420> more<00:03:02.659> than<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:02.959> my<00:03:03.140> length<00:03:03.379> apart

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
you're more than the my length apart

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:13.890 
you're more than the my length apart
slightly<00:03:04.700> over<00:03:05.299> an<00:03:05.360> eye<00:03:05.540> length<00:03:05.750> apart

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:21.619 

see<00:03:14.470> that

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:23.750 

it's<00:03:22.140> better<00:03:22.379> make<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.769> eyes<00:03:22.980> a<00:03:23.280> little<00:03:23.340> too

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
it's better make the eyes a little too

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.800 
it's better make the eyes a little too
big<00:03:24.560> and<00:03:25.560> too<00:03:25.590> small<00:03:27.980> on<00:03:28.980> a<00:03:29.069> baby<00:03:29.450> or<00:03:30.450> anybody

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
big and too small on a baby or anybody

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:37.210 
big and too small on a baby or anybody
for<00:03:31.019> that<00:03:31.049> matter<00:03:32.329> without<00:03:33.329> going<00:03:33.750> overboard

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.619 

now<00:03:38.220> these<00:03:39.620> irises<00:03:40.819> are<00:03:41.819> really<00:03:42.120> quite<00:03:42.359> large

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:42.629 
now these irises are really quite large

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:44.599 
now these irises are really quite large
because<00:03:43.230> this<00:03:43.409> is<00:03:43.560> a<00:03:43.590> pretty<00:03:43.859> young<00:03:44.069> baby<00:03:44.340> only

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
because this is a pretty young baby only

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:49.550 
because this is a pretty young baby only
eight<00:03:44.849> months<00:03:47.750> so<00:03:48.750> if<00:03:48.840> you<00:03:48.930> make<00:03:49.079> these<00:03:49.200> irises

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
eight months so if you make these irises

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.309 
eight months so if you make these irises
too<00:03:49.889> small<00:03:50.719> it's<00:03:51.719> going<00:03:51.810> to<00:03:51.930> make<00:03:52.049> the<00:03:52.170> baby

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
too small it's going to make the baby

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:59.839 
too small it's going to make the baby
look<00:03:52.560> a<00:03:52.739> lot<00:03:53.250> older<00:03:58.069> so<00:03:59.069> we<00:03:59.280> have<00:03:59.459> to<00:03:59.579> make<00:03:59.730> it

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
look a lot older so we have to make it

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:06.490 
look a lot older so we have to make it
big<00:04:00.060> enough<00:04:01.280> to<00:04:02.280> get<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.459> age<00:04:03.950> correct

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
direction exactly see how simple it is

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.459 
direction exactly see how simple it is
you<00:04:44.270> don't<00:04:44.419> have<00:04:44.599> to<00:04:45.310> overwork<00:04:46.310> the<00:04:46.969> eyes<00:04:47.469> to

00:04:48.459 --> 00:04:48.469 
you don't have to overwork the eyes to

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:53.890 
you don't have to overwork the eyes to
get<00:04:48.590> them<00:04:48.710> lifelike<00:04:50.860> just<00:04:51.860> absolute<00:04:52.659> if<00:04:53.659> the

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
get them lifelike just absolute if the

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.860 
get them lifelike just absolute if the
the<00:04:54.469> basic<00:04:54.919> dimensions<00:04:55.400> correct<00:04:55.939> and<00:04:56.779> the

the basic dimensions correct and the

the basic dimensions correct and the
line<00:04:57.169> expression<00:04:57.860> is<00:04:58.279> so<00:04:58.580> important<00:04:59.240> to<00:04:59.360> have

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
line expression is so important to have

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:07.390 
line expression is so important to have
nice<00:05:00.740> lines<00:05:04.449> and<00:05:05.449> I<00:05:05.539> break<00:05:05.810> that<00:05:06.589> broke<00:05:06.889> off<00:05:07.099> so

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
nice lines and I break that broke off so

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.670 
nice lines and I break that broke off so
we<00:05:08.060> just<00:05:08.180> extend<00:05:08.659> it<00:05:08.749> down<00:05:08.810> about<00:05:09.229> half<00:05:09.529> an

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
we just extend it down about half an

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:16.239 
we just extend it down about half an
inch<00:05:09.939> there<00:05:10.939> fingers<00:05:11.770> and<00:05:14.979> we're<00:05:15.979> in<00:05:16.069> business

00:05:16.239 --> 00:05:16.249 
inch there fingers and we're in business

inch there fingers and we're in business
that's<00:05:16.699> what<00:05:16.849> I<00:05:16.939> like<00:05:17.120> about<00:05:17.150> these

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:18.099 
that's what I like about these

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:21.360 
that's what I like about these

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
mechanical drawing pencils they're very

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:29.019 
mechanical drawing pencils they're very
quick<00:05:22.370> to<00:05:23.439> sharpen<00:05:24.439> and<00:05:27.550> there's<00:05:28.550> very<00:05:28.819> little

00:05:29.019 --> 00:05:29.029 
quick to sharpen and there's very little

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:44.589 
there those two little highlights and
come<00:05:40.939> down<00:05:42.399> it's<00:05:43.399> a<00:05:43.520> shadow<00:05:43.789> there<00:05:44.120> and<00:05:44.330> get

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:44.599 
come down it's a shadow there and get

that<00:05:44.719> little<00:05:44.960> ball<00:05:45.169> the<00:05:45.379> nose<00:05:45.560> shade<00:05:45.919> it<00:05:46.039> in

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:46.159 
that little ball the nose shade it in

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:53.170 
that little ball the nose shade it in
just<00:05:46.399> right

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.040 

there's<00:05:53.780> so<00:05:53.960> few<00:05:53.990> lines<00:05:54.530> on<00:05:54.740> the<00:05:54.860> nose<00:05:56.050> that

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
there's so few lines on the nose that

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.620 
there's so few lines on the nose that
the<00:05:57.229> shading<00:05:57.699> really<00:05:58.699> is<00:05:58.910> paramount

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:01.630 
the shading really is paramount

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.290 
the shading really is paramount

just<00:06:15.229> make<00:06:15.380> these<00:06:15.560> subtle<00:06:15.949> observations<00:06:16.699> as

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:16.940 
just make these subtle observations as

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:24.300 
just make these subtle observations as

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:24.310 
you go then your drawing takes on

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:29.439 
you go then your drawing takes on
expression<00:06:25.840> and<00:06:27.280> watch<00:06:28.280> now<00:06:28.880> the<00:06:28.910> width<00:06:29.360> of
