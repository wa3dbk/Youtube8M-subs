00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
them to the black shades you can't see

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.729 
them to the black shades you can't see
it<00:03:26.730> in<00:03:26.790> my<00:03:26.879> purple<00:03:27.209> one<00:03:27.389> but<00:03:28.079> my<00:03:28.200> black<00:03:28.500> one

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
it in my purple one but my black one

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.849 
it in my purple one but my black one
here<00:03:28.950> I've<00:03:29.069> used<00:03:29.430> in<00:03:29.930> this<00:03:30.930> one<00:03:31.139> and<00:03:31.379> there's

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
here I've used in this one and there's

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.309 
here I've used in this one and there's
actually<00:03:31.950> blue<00:03:32.400> shimmer<00:03:32.669> in<00:03:32.910> there<00:03:33.200> so<00:03:34.200> it's

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
actually blue shimmer in there so it's

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.619 
actually blue shimmer in there so it's
made<00:03:34.470> to<00:03:34.500> like<00:03:34.829> ants<00:03:35.190> blue<00:03:35.370> eyes<00:03:35.519> on<00:03:35.910> this<00:03:36.450> one

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:36.629 
made to like ants blue eyes on this one

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:38.030 
made to like ants blue eyes on this one
here<00:03:36.780> for<00:03:36.900> brown<00:03:37.109> eyes<00:03:37.230> I<00:03:37.379> think<00:03:37.590> just<00:03:37.769> as<00:03:37.919> the

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
here for brown eyes I think just as the

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.250 
here for brown eyes I think just as the
purple<00:03:38.340> shimmer<00:03:38.519> in<00:03:38.790> it<00:03:38.910> they<00:03:39.900> make<00:03:40.079> them<00:03:40.230> for

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
purple shimmer in it they make them for

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.199 
purple shimmer in it they make them for
different<00:03:40.620> always<00:03:40.859> blue<00:03:41.220> hazel<00:03:41.639> brown<00:03:41.819> and

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
different always blue hazel brown and

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.580 
different always blue hazel brown and
green<00:03:43.519> so<00:03:44.519> there<00:03:45.090> are<00:03:45.120> four<00:03:45.989> set<00:03:46.349> to<00:03:46.500> the

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
green so there are four set to the

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.110 
green so there are four set to the
original<00:03:46.949> and<00:03:47.129> then<00:03:47.430> they<00:03:47.519> most<00:03:47.699> recently

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
original and then they most recently

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.580 
original and then they most recently
came<00:03:48.329> out<00:03:48.449> with<00:03:48.510> these<00:03:48.750> but<00:03:49.109> they're<00:03:49.260> in<00:03:49.410> the
