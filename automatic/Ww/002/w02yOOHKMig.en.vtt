00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:07.090
 my name is alice and I signed up 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.849
 this year at the master's degree course 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:12.940
 in sciences of lifelong education 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:15.849
 continuing education my path is 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.320
 it was a bit anomalous to say in the sense 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.510
 that I come from work experience 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.550
 three years in an agency 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.150
 for work and within this 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.700
 agency 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.550
 I was in charge of detecting what they were 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.770
 the needs of companies in terms of 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.439
 search for staff and then to do 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.809
 own selections proper and 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.969
 what I have found in these years is 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:40.539
 It's been a while since companies and people 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:42.699
 job seekers are communicating little 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:45.460
 in the sense that they know little about one 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:47.199
 of the other then it happens to people who 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.989
 they look for work they don't know at all 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:52.120
 what are the demands of the companies e 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.729
 vice versa of companies that sometimes have 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.819
 absurd requests like the classic 

00:00:53.729 --> 00:01:00.519
 apprentice with experience or similar 

00:00:56.819 --> 00:01:02.409
 another observation of these years 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:05.110
 it is press that in a labor market 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:07.299
 as flexible as that of now i 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.820
 moments of transition are much more 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:12.159
 many compared to those of the past 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.130
 so while once transitions that 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:17.320
 transition between schools must accept 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.299
 universities and the world of work today are 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.310
 much more numerous and therefore can 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:23.920
 be transitioned from one job to another 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.630
 rather than role within 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.240
 the same company etc. so we are 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.670
 called 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.399
 professional to many changes that 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.950
 compared to a time from these 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:37.350
 observations that have realized the 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.899
 absolute necessity at this time of 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.759
 specific figures that you take care of 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:45.509
 take care of guidance and 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:48.450
 training and so I decided myself 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.970
 to deviate from the path and to try 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.860
 enter to enter this world me 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.960
 I am informed about various masters are 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.140
 went to give well some more hypotheses 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.280
 This course seemed convincing to me 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.090
 of master degree because on the one hand 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.670
 complete from an educational point of view 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.470
 in the sense that it addresses all subjects 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.720
 which in my opinion are therefore important 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.940
 from the skills assessment to sociology 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.049
 of guidance psychology work 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.709
 etc 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:19.650
 and then because it seems to me that it combines well 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.209
 theory and practice then on the one hand 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.269
 precisely from an educational point of view 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.400
 complete however also the practice is 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:29.010
 dedicated an important part therefore a 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.850
 fairly professional training 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:35.100
 full-bodied and educational workshops in 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.220
 which cases are addressed 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.700
 specific to be applied later in the world of 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.390
 work 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.520
 this was my choice and how each 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.780
 choice is a bet 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.780
 we hope to win it
