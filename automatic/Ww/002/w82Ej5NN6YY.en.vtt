 paula the formula to solve for you today 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:35.240
 if we want to break 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.339
 this formula

 French Nobel Prize for Mathematics 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.890
 it is difficult the French it carries the superiority of the French champion 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.240
 for the handling of the game 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:02.220
 cyprus it's indisputable visible it's at least it's 90 then

 the supporters of the president ouattara must be worn tabard

 they stayed for over an hour to discuss about my purpose is 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.990
 really to do with the president cheat these numbers of experts in

 numbers for the advisor 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.190
 after all these tips the state has moved to the practical work of Algiers 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.670
 to be too many have you seen 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.790
 as mathematical Olympiads a competition of some giants opposing 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.790
 trade unions 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.310
 it was still less difficult than our passion from the beginning 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.750
 yet do you think they planted themselves and not just a little 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.049
 2007 I can not anymore 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.099
 a million are on another

 when it echoes the criminal police watched or listened 

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:26.289
 Thursday the union all the numbers are still useful 

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:28.489
 when 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.489
 so send year 

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:34.809
 among the best 

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:36.549
 among those arrested 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.089
 this is the ratp air light effect for the first time 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.739
 it looks like to open at this point 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.709
 you really have to do it on purpose and not 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:50.429
 barbara twenty-five seniors reacted by claiming to make steam 

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:56.119
 at the 43 after before we spot them hour by hour he won the 

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:57.369
 victory 

00:02:57.369 --> 00:03:02.739
 the alternative the encounters with first price purchase 3d movie is there 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:05.009
 therefore the transfer years 

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:07.719
 the rebound of the activity 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:11.089
 the part of his malaise of the investor staff 

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:12.709
 boards 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.249
 twenty-nine people 

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:17.069
 the group had also voiced on the sidewalk 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.229
 Paris Reuters but without the complementary ones 

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:23.999
 for his departure 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.199
 the world 

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:28.579
 and on this line 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:32.920
 the 28 meter sidewalk for the police there is a personal life for them 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:35.169
 unions 25 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:38.109
 and the newman census or what 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:40.819
 in this case see here 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.889
 well I believe for professional figures 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:50.040
 all year these people it's their job here the hits their mission their 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.980
 obsession then you understand millions of pv 937 zidane participants 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.400
 who come back to the prefectural calculation is a calculation of 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.539
 guitars 

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:01.629
 and even later 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:04.849
 the guys who say the numbers need to be wary 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:07.879
 because he would not have better to be pigeon 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:08.919
 Lotto 

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:10.369
 at the casino 

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:13.369
 all casinos of all kinds the red numbers 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:17.689
 we promise will go she disappears 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.909
 the numbers prove 

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:25.349
 and all that makes that when we know how to put them at the bottom 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:27.139
 we can stop talking 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.719
 but we can not stop counting 

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:30.889
 the world its number 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:33.889
 it's a nightmare 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.139
 in France country of the mathematicians too it's the trick the numbers are neither right 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.150
 neither left nor undisputed center 

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:50.739
 the issue of zero pensions and you know it well just look at this 

00:04:50.739 --> 00:04:53.909
 happening around us is not a question of left or right 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:05:00.490
 it's just a demographic issue demographically mathematically 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.539
 circulate 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:04.539
 if the calculated figures 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.909
 well we too 

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:12.080
 it's in 1990 that davide guarneri emmanuelle guilbart surveyed 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.400
 for he is the retreat 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.669
 melenchon go out we told you so 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:21.750
 marion 2040 for he quickly 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:25.159
 work more to pay the native of tulle 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:26.419
 three retirees 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:29.419
 it's mathematically managed funds 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.699
 quebec growth in 2040 both produce as much as four today 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:37.889
 he did that the fact 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:40.889
 we should even retire at 58 in the world 

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:44.249
 I see who do not listen 

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:46.120
 France produces 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.249
 two thousand billion euros we can create 

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:54.240
 to pay the pensions you have to motivate 13% of the cake receives more than 260 

00:05:54.239 --> 00:05:56.169
 billion 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:57.130
 here is an action 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:00.939
 tell us that we can only in 2040 will have to find the most rigorous 

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:03.619
 720 billion euros 

00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:05.289
 these futures 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:06.289
 I hear you 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:09.339
 yes m something in 2040 if it goes on like that 

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:11.469
 provisional 

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:16.089
 4000 billion euros to pay more pensions will require 

00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:18.860
 find that one 18% 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.860
 back to the beginning of our problem 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.490
 it remained 1740 billion euros at the nose 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:29.419
 but in 2040 after the demographic horror 

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:33.419
 it will stay at 3280 billion help it could do it 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.430
 disc 1 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:36.999
 I say nothing 

00:06:36.999 --> 00:06:39.999
 and if the numbers only served to demonstrate what we chose to 

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:41.550
 demonstrate that 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.009
 the real demonstration is when we say in the end we can only I had 

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:45.199
 reason
