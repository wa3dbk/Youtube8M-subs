lighter<00:03:30.560> weights<00:03:30.950> and<00:03:31.340> they<00:03:32.090> do<00:03:32.150> it<00:03:32.420> as<00:03:32.540> part

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
of a finishing circuit at the end of a

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.600 
of a finishing circuit at the end of a
workout<00:03:36.170> those<00:03:37.010> were<00:03:37.190> real<00:03:37.430> light<00:03:37.670> dumbbells

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610

workout those were real light dumbbells
so<00:03:40.610> here's<00:03:40.880> some<00:03:41.060> ideas<00:03:41.180> for<00:03:41.690> you<00:03:42.340> to

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
so here's some ideas for you to

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.699 
so here's some ideas for you to
implement<00:03:43.640> it<00:03:44.540> could<00:03:44.810> be<00:03:44.900> the<00:03:45.020> first<00:03:45.290> exercise

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
implement it could be the first exercise

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.280 
implement it could be the first exercise
in<00:03:46.160> the<00:03:46.190> workout<00:03:46.670> I<00:03:47.000> want<00:03:47.660> the<00:03:47.750> wrestlers<00:03:48.140> to

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
in the workout I want the wrestlers to

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.400 
in the workout I want the wrestlers to
be<00:03:48.410> fully<00:03:48.680> warmed<00:03:49.010> up<00:03:49.780> maybe<00:03:50.780> get<00:03:51.020> one<00:03:51.200> or<00:03:51.350> two

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
be fully warmed up maybe get one or two

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.229 
be fully warmed up maybe get one or two
lighter<00:03:51.800> sent<00:03:52.160> to<00:03:52.250> the<00:03:52.370> farmer<00:03:52.760> walk<00:03:52.970> in

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
lighter sent to the farmer walk in

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.120 
lighter sent to the farmer walk in
before<00:03:54.080> they<00:03:54.230> get<00:03:54.410> going<00:03:54.709> with<00:03:54.830> the<00:03:54.920> heavy

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
before they get going with the heavy

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.060 
before they get going with the heavy
stuff<00:03:55.430> and<00:03:55.730> then<00:03:56.390> they<00:03:56.540> hit<00:03:56.720> them<00:03:56.840> hard<00:03:57.170> so<00:03:58.010> it

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
stuff and then they hit them hard so it

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.340 
stuff and then they hit them hard so it
could<00:03:58.220> be<00:03:58.250> the<00:03:58.489> first<00:03:58.760> max<00:03:59.600> effort<00:03:59.930> lift

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
could be the first max effort lift

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.860 
could be the first max effort lift
through<00:04:00.980> the<00:04:01.010> workout<00:04:01.489> or<00:04:01.760> we<00:04:02.510> could<00:04:02.660> do<00:04:02.720> it<00:04:02.750> a

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
through the workout or we could do it a

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.410 
through the workout or we could do it a
little<00:04:03.020> bit<00:04:03.170> lighter<00:04:03.850> throw<00:04:04.850> it<00:04:04.940> at<00:04:05.090> the<00:04:05.209> end

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
little bit lighter throw it at the end

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.960 
little bit lighter throw it at the end
of<00:04:05.540> the<00:04:05.630> workout<00:04:06.050> and<00:04:06.320> maybe<00:04:07.100> they<00:04:07.280> do<00:04:07.340> farmer

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
of the workout and maybe they do farmer

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.350 
of the workout and maybe they do farmer
