00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
angriest you're you know horrible person

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.730 
angriest you're you know horrible person
on<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.729> planet<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.540> same<00:01:36.900> amount<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.380> people

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
on the planet the same amount of people

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.130 
on the planet the same amount of people
are<00:01:37.829> going<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.189> like<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.939> hate<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.780> so

that<00:01:40.229> makes<00:01:40.259> sense<00:01:40.439> because<00:01:41.060> it's<00:01:42.060> just<00:01:42.180> the

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
that makes sense because it's just the

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.999 
that makes sense because it's just the
percentages<00:01:43.079> are<00:01:43.259> probably<00:01:43.680> going<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:43.920> be<00:01:43.979> the

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
percentages are probably going to be the

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.649 
percentages are probably going to be the
same<00:01:44.250> because<00:01:44.549> if<00:01:44.700> you're<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.850> crazy<00:01:45.240> person

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
same because if you're a crazy person

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.109 
same because if you're a crazy person
there's<00:01:46.409> probably<00:01:46.649> other<00:01:46.920> crazy<00:01:47.399> people<00:01:47.939> that

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
there's probably other crazy people that

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.100 
there's probably other crazy people that
like<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.509> in<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.689> group
