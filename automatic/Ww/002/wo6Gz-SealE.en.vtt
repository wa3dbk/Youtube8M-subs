clock you mentioned showing people how
to<00:00:11.400> become<00:00:11.610> or<00:00:12.240> get<00:00:12.570> out<00:00:12.599> of<00:00:12.900> where<00:00:13.019> they're<00:00:13.200> at

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
to become or get out of where they're at

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.640 
to become or get out of where they're at
and<00:00:13.349> become<00:00:14.070> something<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:14.849> I<00:00:15.809> think<00:00:16.440> that's

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
and become something and I think that's

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.590 
and become something and I think that's
actually<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.340> trap<00:00:18.060> that<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.330> lot<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.510> people

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
actually a trap that a lot of people

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.200 
actually a trap that a lot of people
fall<00:00:19.020> into<00:00:19.230> they<00:00:20.039> think<00:00:20.340> they<00:00:20.520> need<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.910> become

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
fall into they think they need to become

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.540 
fall into they think they need to become
something<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.260> they<00:00:22.529> need<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.859> get<00:00:23.070> out<00:00:23.310> of

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
something and they need to get out of

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.279 
something and they need to get out of
where<00:00:23.730> they're<00:00:23.910> at<00:00:24.029> but<00:00:24.330> what<00:00:24.570> I'm<00:00:24.750> trying<00:00:25.080> to

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
where they're at but what I'm trying to

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.790 
it's it's something I've been working on
for<00:00:52.410> quite<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:53.010> few<00:00:53.070> years<00:00:53.250> now<00:00:53.520> but<00:00:54.329> it's

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
for quite a few years now but it's

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.630 
for quite a few years now but it's
mindfulness<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.010> part<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.399> process

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
mindfulness is a part of that process

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.349 
mindfulness is a part of that process
oops<00:00:57.629> really<00:00:58.109> checking<00:00:58.410> in<00:00:58.820> and<00:00:59.820> also<00:01:00.149> I've

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
oops really checking in and also I've

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.000 
oops really checking in and also I've
created<00:01:00.870> something<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.440> call<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.620> loving

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
created something I call the loving

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.929 
created something I call the loving
parent<00:01:02.399> which<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:03.539> we<00:01:03.870> all<00:01:03.989> talk<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.320> ourselves

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
parent which is we all talk to ourselves

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:09.050 
parent which is we all talk to ourselves
so<00:01:05.939> I've<00:01:06.090> trained<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.930> voice<00:01:07.790> to<00:01:08.790> be<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
so I've trained that voice to be the

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.780 
so I've trained that voice to be the
voice<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.450> loving<00:01:09.689> parent<00:01:10.310> so<00:01:11.310> instead<00:01:11.729> of

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
voice of a loving parent so instead of

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.070 
voice of a loving parent so instead of
you<00:01:12.119> can't<00:01:12.360> get<00:01:12.479> rid<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.720> voice<00:01:12.840> that's

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
you can't get rid of the voice that's

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.270 
you can't get rid of the voice that's
talking<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.560> look<00:01:13.680> like<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:13.979> can<00:01:14.100> meditate

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
talking to look like you can meditate

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.600 
talking to look like you can meditate
for<00:01:14.549> 30<00:01:15.240> years<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:16.080> during<00:01:16.710> your<00:01:16.979> meditations

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
for 30 years and during your meditations

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.670 
for 30 years and during your meditations
you<00:01:17.850> know<00:01:17.970> maybe<00:01:18.270> maybe<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:19.049> voice<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.530> gone

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680
