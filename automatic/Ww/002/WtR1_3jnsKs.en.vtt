00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 astral plane warning if you have not seen 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.450
 this episode I do not recommend you to see 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.400
 these first impressions since you 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.410
 we can ruin a surprise or something 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.809
 unexpected anyway the link of the 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.730
 episode in the description certainly a 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.680
 great episode where we can see the 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.930
 fox thinking that comes out in other 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.029
 five short fables in this episode 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.800
 we can see that the fox is something 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.720
 lonely and can see some spirits 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.760
 as affine but it's weird since the 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.619
 original is asleep at the best you can 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.960
 be remains of missing the fox 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.969
 to fall asleep you know for example to 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.739
 you when you go to bed for 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.690
 falling asleep do not fall asleep at the moment of 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.090
 lie down but have to wait for a 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.010
 good moment I continue in this episode 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.960
 we can also see the princess 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.360
 inflatable that lets children jump 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.520
 in her but apparently she is already tired 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.410
 and take the kids out of her in this 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.390
 episode we can see that the princess 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.160
 inflatable does not live in a kingdom but in a 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.260
 luxury house that apparently has a 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.390
 secret hiding place and a camera in the 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.820
 hideaway you can see bottles boxes and 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.829
 many blenders and a TV where 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.960
 can see what the camera is recording 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.119
 is tormenting a beaver or a 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.450
 Spin body does not differ very well 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.460
 whatever 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.619
 since it has thorns and big teeth 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.869
 which manages to enter the hiding place 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.570
 crushed the buttons with their thorns 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.520
 and the shell he he he he he he he he and also 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.560
 we can see the ice king who is in the 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.450
 kingdom of cloud where we can see many 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.759
 groups with the body of someone normal 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.159
 they may be of the same type as the 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.170
 cloud that we see in the episode the tower and 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.750
 the ice king is flirting with a 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.579
 of them heh heh heh heh heh heh and 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.310
 we can see Mars in which we can 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.289
 see gross com globe and I think they are the 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.049
 four faces that live inside it 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:42.240
 body and good been apparently them 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.280
 they are so inspired by the words of 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.229
 end that apparently decide to sacrifice 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.299
 to divert a blue comet that is 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.189
 directed towards them and apparently it was the 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.530
 same comet that we see at the end of the 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.049
 episode of bergen and he managed to divert 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.049
 but now it was heading to earth but 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.179
 final moment that bro hof globe and 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.970
 cross good not say so much we will 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:05.489
 tell them the 4g I still at the moment that 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.439
 4g impact with the comet end returned another 

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:09.539
 time to his body and he did not see that now the 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.220
 comet is heading towards them then 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.260
 we can see that a 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.650
 approach to him commits 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.870
 but what they believe is not a comet but 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.879
 the ship of the end father which is 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.829
 find inside her without escape anymore 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:24.930
 that due to the impact the computer that 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.790
 He handles it was malfunctioning so 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.189
 very best if the ship hits and does not 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.230
 makes an explosion the end father already 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:33.120
 is trapped in the land of the USA and 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.010
 now if you can not escape from fini 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.590
 well let's see what my friend thinks 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.599
 recording to the truth queiro ndr was a 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.670
 great episode where we managed to see the 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:44.010
 fini father is very true what 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.379
 you said about what would happen if it collides 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.780
 with the earth but do not you think that in this 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:51.150
 episode could not get in the way and I want to 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.030
 say to many we would have liked to see 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.010
 betty in this episode see a bit of what 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.230
 what is he doing apart in this 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.209
 episode characters came out that we 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.730
 they come out a lot in this series or they have 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.129
 come out in less than three chapters and it 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.230
 He made a lot of lack of and you are quite right 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:09.329
 bra won but if that were the 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.849
 chapter had a duration of more than 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:13.290
 13 minutes which would be impossible 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:15.090
 pass it on TV and good friends the 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.040

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.079
