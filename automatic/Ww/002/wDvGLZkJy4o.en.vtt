00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.430
 hi my name is kirill rubasov i 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.780
 president of multi-finance company 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:12.870
 and in this video I want to discuss such 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.260
 new apple watch product like its mine in 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.379
 particulars how can it be used 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.449
 multifinance 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.650
 it is for financial deliveries 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.029
 products first 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.550
 first now u have on all the experts 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.150
 deliver a financial product using 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:34.770
 iphone need to understand how convenient 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:38.600
 will use it on deliveries yes 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.600
 well let's look at the characteristics 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:46.140
 go to the site and 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:49.469
 who watched the presentation already well who 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.789
 did not look accordingly bad but 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.520
 no less in general 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:58.230
 what is the main thing but apple watch 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:01.230
 no cameras to consequently documents 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:05.909
 which we need to work 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.400
 they can not be used 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.770
 photograph documents and 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.140
 accordingly in this regard is not ludok 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:18.509
 so this iphone is irreplaceable here 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:20.630
 also fail to use not 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.430
 get to use 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.630
 so well, something does not work for us 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.610
 presentation well let's click here 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:34.159
 also fail to use iphone 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.159
 weave ie apple watch as 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:48.299
 as a payment acceptance until appeared there 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:51.530
 apple pay is such a thing but again they are not 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.030
 he can pay but not 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.939
 accept payments for now 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.420
 further we learn but so far this 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.250
 you can not do well in general of course you can 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.950
 would be some business style 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:12.610
 buy from these here either sport by the way here 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:18.520
 here you will need to understand how 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:21.880
 signals from iphone are sent to the demolition 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.380
 apple watch sent to 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.210
 directly 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.790
 aiklaud yes and how much can you record 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.410
 trackers and see where the person is 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.050
 if this thing is realized it will be 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.420
 mega bomb because right now that 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.040
 there is on iphone it is not very approach 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.160
 analysis follows person mode 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.070
 real time but not watching them and 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.810
 that's the whole third so how much 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.030
 efficiently man drive and as far as 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.280
 effectively than finance experts 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.130
 use your time here you can 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.300
 using a and look rather 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.360
 there will be such a thing 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.130
 provided there is yes there is now there 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.739
 programs that track trackers but 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:05.410
 immediately and it is necessary that several 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:08.060
 several people at once 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.860
 it was possible to watch the world in time 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.060
 where who is this for the organizer 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.090
 delivery is very convenient 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.030
 so this question will also need 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:20.959
 also investigate any devils here well 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:24.769
 all sorts of health options I think 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:26.510
 what's for the delivery organizer this 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.100
 no information will be needed for customers 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:35.690
 also 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:36.980
 but generally what else of the core of 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.110
 the main thing that can be 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.570
 take delivery address directly to 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.090
 iwatch what you can find a place 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.940
 also on his cheat more convenient but the same 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:51.950
 the functionality was of course the same 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:56.239
 iPhones well in general principle 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:58.370
 chip is that the main chip is what can 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:01.040
 there will be a decrease ie mode 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:06.440
 real time tracker that's needed 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.549
 question and study in general here is my 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.610
 first cast 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:12.970
 informational question 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:17.620
 how to use your iwatch 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:19.269
 Answers write in this video below and the most 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.890
 soon we will find out how 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.260
 really it will work but by 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.930
 the latest release will be after the new year 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.940
 but having read it beforehand 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.620
 looking carefully we will understand how 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:34.660
 as if here's a plus some more 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:37.270
 applications will be available but then again 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.800
 it makes sense that iwatch does not work 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.300
 does not work without 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.580
 iphone is very good therefore don't care 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.750
 if we introduce 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.310
 if we introduce this 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.440
 the device then you will need 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:55.020
 switch to the fifth iphone and 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:58.300
 we now have 4 4s and accordingly 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:02.740
 do a little upgrade, well, let's see 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:06.250
 How much will these functions be? 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:08.050
 these features will be helpful my name is 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.580
