being crucified and I see as the first

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.509 
being crucified and I see as the first
half<00:02:49.450> of<00:02:49.599> it<00:02:49.720> is<00:02:49.840> her<00:02:50.049> feeling<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.709> pain<00:02:50.950> and

half of it is her feeling the pain and

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.990 
half of it is her feeling the pain and
the<00:02:52.480> suffering<00:02:52.750> that<00:02:53.079> we<00:02:53.769> all<00:02:53.950> should<00:02:54.730> feel

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
the suffering that we all should feel

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.880 
the suffering that we all should feel
for<00:02:55.299> him<00:02:55.450> sacrificing<00:02:56.200> himself<00:02:56.379> for<00:02:56.739> our<00:02:56.769> sins

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
for him sacrificing himself for our sins

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.460

out<00:07:09.800> of<00:07:09.860> my<00:07:10.040> mind<00:07:10.070> but<00:07:10.639> once<00:07:10.910> I<00:07:11.030> got<00:07:11.150> up<00:07:11.180> there<00:07:11.300> I

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:11.540 
out of my mind but once I got up there I

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.560 
out of my mind but once I got up there I
was<00:07:11.690> completely<00:07:12.199> calm<00:07:12.440> and<00:07:12.979> relieved<00:07:13.850> and<00:07:14.240> I

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:16.900 
thought our solos went great and

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.200 
thought our solos went great and
everything<00:07:17.900> went<00:07:18.470> really<00:07:18.800> well<00:07:18.830> but<00:07:19.430> it<00:07:20.000> was
