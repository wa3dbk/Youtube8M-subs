00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:10.639
 hi everybody, car keep on doing 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:13.400
 many difficult heating issues 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:16.830
 I want to upgrade the stove wise 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.960
 than the son of working out and yet defend a 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.660
 I need to redistribute things like 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:26.539
 Today watched and videos about this 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:29.699
 youtube them with Vladimir sugar 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:33.540
 corresponded looked as if it 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:37.770
 video but for myself as if zamechku 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:41.629
 made the point is that the stove is 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.430
 it turns out it's mobile inside 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:48.140
 the bulkhead rolled passed blown off 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:51.030
 I get by and large as 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.840
 long burning that is seen here 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.770
 she is on top 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.410
 cap tournament 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:02.310
 still walls which the structure comes from 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:05.790
 back of the front pipe 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:11.370
 still wanna make trepanations cut and 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:15.690
 redo this partition for example well 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:20.620
 how about an hour we start co2 i thought she didn't 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:26.220
 well ka ka ka around 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:29.220
 Clara some distance 3 meters three 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.220
 o'clock 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:38.369
 why is what gets transferred 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:42.990
 which stands inside can be seen on which 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:46.259
 distance from the exhaust it was welded 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.850
 that is, I want to shorten yours 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:53.549
 40 is obtained a centimeter 400 millimeters 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:57.539
 the partition itself 30 i.e. it turns out 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:01.649
 10 centimeters I think that's enough 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:04.679
 small gap what you flame thought 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.950
 up in general is now at 10 centimeters 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:10.679
 shorten it still turns out the top 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.299
 pieces always get out cut out a hole 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.819
 under the pipe 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:19.110
 which is also welding that if strongly 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:21.989
 snot cut and that is, it all cleared 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.220
 as if it is also an additional barrier 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:27.690
 created therefore 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.299
 and when everything was so cultural 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.120
 was stained 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:38.209
 but it is a pity in general I will now 3 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.209
 cut the partition off let go 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:48.329
 we will probably cook looking around 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:53.370
 plate to the partition lowered it 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:55.980
 turns out to be 10 centimeters from the top 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.670
 part of that is, compared to what there 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.909
 It was here 5 to 3 I think 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.549
 born will of course greatly in 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:10.439
 general now it's all about cooking 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:13.129
 I will weld the top cover as if 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:16.189
 Basically, I do not know today if it works 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:24.120
 may even try this 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:28.349
 while 10 is clearly visible here apache 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:33.959
 hoping for a little bit of fuel 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:38.579
 above made flue holes 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:44.250
 I do not know myself or maybe you will give me a little 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:48.799
 pay generally tried on store 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:53.030
 then this trepanation made the bourgeoisie 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:55.950
 not away from working here is that 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.010
 continues to bear 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:02.370
 it looks after welding did not 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.830
 solid seam cook in case 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:09.239
 5 you will need to disassemble 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:12.660
 it turns out the plate so forward from me 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:15.569
 it was a complete seam 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.190
 together even under the letters will 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.750
 there is nothing to break there 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.549
 will be 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.580
 you can even be a little better actor 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:27.330
 because there was a solid noise not 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:31.010
 it took a lot of time away from 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:37.470
 quality increases the stone does not fail 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:39.210
 because my dollar to 25 is no longer 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:43.050
 need to think body repair 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.680
 more about it maxims I think 150 how 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.120
 no to me 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:52.440
 totally satisfied saying 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:57.419
 this kind of and angular old well 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.919
 how would all the fences and digest themselves so far 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:01.320
 not 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:03.660
 that cooked me expressing cooked and because 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.789
 what kenga says semi-automatic there 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:10.789
 it turns out carbon dioxide and 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:10.789
 the prophet in general, I continue 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:19.570
 he reworked it finished talking 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:23.900
 lid in a circle 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:28.120
 when now for an hour I will probably 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:30.980
 experience because there is something like that 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:34.490
 impatiently really wanna pry like this 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:38.860
 everything will work only in the process 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:45.110
 automatic welding was not until time 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:50.440
 caustic in general, everything about everything went well 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:50.440
 about two hours 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.490
 disassembly 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:59.600
 it took me two stones three days heap 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:02.960
 garbage flew very much hoarded up 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:06.830
 dust from the abrasive stone had 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:09.340
 will sell him a dozen in total 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.340
 I will now 

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:13.960
 recently everything works 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.810
 project album 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:19.250
 yesterday finished there 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.250
 just beer was already late 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:25.190
 I charge you to order it on the camera 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:28.870
 thoughtfully abandoned slept will also be in 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.870
 in general, I will get more work 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.479
 here
