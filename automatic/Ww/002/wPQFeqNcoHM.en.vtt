00:00:55.849 --> 00:00:55.859 
you go as you see we are in the infinity

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:57.470 
you go as you see we are in the infinity
round<00:00:56.129> all<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.519> the<00:00:56.670> zombies<00:00:57.030> are<00:00:57.179> invincible

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
round all of the zombies are invincible

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.959 
round all of the zombies are invincible
and<00:00:58.230> they're<00:00:58.859> pretty<00:00:59.039> much<00:00:59.219> endless<00:00:59.579> but

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
and they're pretty much endless but

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.509 
and they're pretty much endless but
actually<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:01.050> zombies<00:01:01.410> are<00:01:01.679> killable<00:01:02.339> with

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
actually the zombies are killable with

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:04.640 
actually the zombies are killable with
the<00:01:02.820> paralyzer<00:01:03.510> but<00:01:03.899> that's<00:01:04.080> not<00:01:04.260> important

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
the paralyzer but that's not important

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.290 
the paralyzer but that's not important
right<00:01:04.680> now<00:01:04.830> what's<00:01:05.129> important<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.700> we're<00:01:06.240> all

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
right now what's important is we're all

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.240 
right now what's important is we're all
looking<00:01:06.480> for<00:01:06.840> bodies<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.710> characters

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
looking for bodies of the characters

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.520 
looking for bodies of the characters
that<00:01:08.520> we're<00:01:08.670> playing<00:01:08.970> as<00:01:09.300> and<00:01:09.630> as<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:10.110> can<00:01:10.290> see

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
that we're playing as and as you can see

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.410 
that we're playing as and as you can see
here<00:01:11.010> they're<00:01:11.220> kind<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.520> just<00:01:11.610> laying<00:01:12.210> around

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
here they're kind of just laying around

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.950 
here they're kind of just laying around
randomly<00:01:13.880> you<00:01:14.880> have<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.150> walk<00:01:15.360> up<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.600> them<00:01:15.810> and

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
randomly you have to walk up to them and

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.550 
randomly you have to walk up to them and
hold<00:01:16.140> X<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:17.240> search<00:01:18.240> them<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.750> once<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.439> get

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
hold X to search them and once you get

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.200 
hold X to search them and once you get
to<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.799> last<00:01:20.009> body<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.579> search<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.030> last

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
to the last body and search the last

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.330 
to the last body and search the last
body<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.689> will<00:01:21.810> find<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.350> lever<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:23.070> looks

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
body you will find a lever that looks

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.840 
body you will find a lever that looks
like<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.210> lever<00:01:24.450> on<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.900> power<00:01:25.259> box<00:01:25.700> once<00:01:26.700> you

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
like the lever on the power box once you

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.359 
like the lever on the power box once you
get<00:01:27.030> this<00:01:27.210> lever<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:28.140> have<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.439> survive<00:01:28.829> for

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
get this lever you have to survive for

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.710 
get this lever you have to survive for
the<00:01:29.399> rest<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.820> infinity<00:01:30.299> round<00:01:30.509> which

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
the rest of the infinity round which

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.499 
the rest of the infinity round which
lasts<00:01:31.110> about<00:01:31.200> two<00:01:31.560> minutes<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:32.009> think<00:01:32.329> you<00:01:33.329> just

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
lasts about two minutes I think you just

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.179 
lasts about two minutes I think you just
got<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.810> try<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.020> survive<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.680> not<00:01:34.829> go<00:01:35.009> down

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
got to try to survive and not go down

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.550 
got to try to survive and not go down
because<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.610> believe<00:01:36.119> if<00:01:36.329> everybody<00:01:36.540> goes<00:01:37.170> down

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
because I believe if everybody goes down

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.730 
because I believe if everybody goes down
then<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.250> game<00:01:38.909> ends<00:01:39.479> but<00:01:39.719> if<00:01:39.930> at<00:01:40.380> least<00:01:40.560> one

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
then the game ends but if at least one

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.830 
then the game ends but if at least one
person<00:01:40.890> survives<00:01:41.640> then<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.060> all<00:01:42.210> wake<00:01:42.479> back

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
person survives then you all wake back

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.039 
person survives then you all wake back
up<00:01:43.110> or<00:01:43.640> get<00:01:44.640> reset<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.060> guess<00:01:45.420> back<00:01:45.719> at<00:01:45.930> the

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
up or get reset I guess back at the

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.050 
up or get reset I guess back at the
guilt<00:01:46.320> guillotine<00:01:46.950> or<00:01:46.979> guillotine<00:01:47.670> however

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
guilt guillotine or guillotine however

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.810 
guilt guillotine or guillotine however
you<00:01:48.119> want<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.390> say<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.719> and<00:01:49.250> pretty<00:01:50.250> much<00:01:50.430> as<00:01:50.640> if

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
you want to say it and pretty much as if

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.149 
you want to say it and pretty much as if

you never won in the infinity round the

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.950 
you never won in the infinity round the
only<00:01:53.340> differences<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.149> will<00:01:54.299> have<00:01:54.630> this

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
only differences you will have this

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.889 
only differences you will have this
lever<00:01:55.289> after<00:01:56.250> this<00:01:56.430> round<00:01:56.729> ends<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:57.780> our

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
lever after this round ends so our

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.770 
lever after this round ends so our
friend<00:01:58.200> here<00:01:58.439> has<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.860> lever<00:01:59.100> he<00:01:59.880> goes<00:02:00.420> up<00:02:00.630> to

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
friend here has the lever he goes up to

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.709 
friend here has the lever he goes up to
the<00:02:00.960> guillotine<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.740> holds<00:02:02.310> X<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.880> place<00:02:03.210> the

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
the guillotine and holds X to place the

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.109 
the guillotine and holds X to place the
lever<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.380> once<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.039> do<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.219> there<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:05.939> go

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
lever and once you do that there you go

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.660 
lever and once you do that there you go
for<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.509> step<00:02:07.020> that's<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.619> end<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:08.070> the

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
for that step that's the end of the

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.999 
for that step that's the end of the
Infinity<00:02:09.210> round<00:02:09.420> step<00:02:09.720> that's<00:02:10.500> all<00:02:10.740> there<00:02:10.890> is

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
Infinity round step that's all there is

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.500 
Infinity round step that's all there is
to<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.460> can<00:02:11.580> just<00:02:11.700> be<00:02:11.760> a<00:02:11.850> little<00:02:11.910> tricky

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
to it it can just be a little tricky

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.540 
to it it can just be a little tricky
with<00:02:12.630> finding<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.200> bodies<00:02:13.560> because<00:02:13.920> where

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
with finding the bodies because where

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.910 
with finding the bodies because where
they<00:02:14.700> spawn<00:02:15.030> changes<00:02:15.960> every

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
they spawn changes every

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.270 
they spawn changes every
time<00:02:17.099> but<00:02:17.849> there<00:02:18.060> are<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.240> few<00:02:18.750> spawns<00:02:19.170> that<00:02:20.130> are

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
time but there are a few spawns that are

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.270 
time but there are a few spawns that are
almost<00:02:21.000> always<00:02:21.569> constant<00:02:22.290> but<00:02:22.800> just<00:02:23.010> be<00:02:23.160> on

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
almost always constant but just be on

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.740 
almost always constant but just be on
the<00:02:23.310> lookout<00:02:23.430> for<00:02:23.760> them<00:02:24.060> you<00:02:24.209> know<00:02:24.330> you<00:02:24.390> got<00:02:24.660> to

the lookout for them you know you got to

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.570 
the lookout for them you know you got to
find<00:02:24.959> all<00:02:25.260> of<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.590> bodies<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:26.099> find<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.400> lever

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
find all of the bodies to find the lever

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.070 
find all of the bodies to find the lever
you<00:02:26.670> can't<00:02:26.970> just<00:02:27.150> search<00:02:27.300> one<00:02:27.599> and<00:02:27.780> get<00:02:27.870> lucky

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
you can't just search one and get lucky

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.330 
you can't just search one and get lucky
and<00:02:28.290> find<00:02:28.349> it<00:02:28.650> because<00:02:28.800> it's<00:02:28.950> always<00:02:29.130> the

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
and find it because it's always the

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.339 
and find it because it's always the
fourth<00:02:29.550> body<00:02:29.849> that<00:02:30.090> you<00:02:30.180> search<00:02:30.480> that<00:02:31.020> you<00:02:31.080> get
