00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:08.780
 It is very much Charmy eh 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:16.610
 We introduce stilts type infinite multiplication method this time 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:16.610
 Please destroy all the doors installed in the village first 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:26.070
 It feels like a reverse version of the digging method 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:30.150
 First install a pillar of about 10 blocks 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.210
 Please make a floor of 4 times 5 at the top 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.210
 Ah 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:48.120
 There is no problem if the upper part can be done, so it is okay to like the work procedure etc. 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:48.120
 You do n't have to build the stairs first or the pillars 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:59.250
 And on top of this 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.250
 Please fence the six doors 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.309
 Hmm 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.550
 Hmm 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.380
 Four days 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.649
 Had 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.649
 eh 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.350
 Hmm 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:25.070
 As one villager is brought after completion 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.070
 It is good to open the entrance 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:42.580
 Please arrange six blocks on the door when the door is installed 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:45.510
 It is good to hold down the shift key on the keyboard 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.510
 1 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:58.560
 The top is now complete 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.890
 After that, only one villager is brought up 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.120
 2nd place 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:08.930
 When we set up stairs 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.930
 Villagers climb up for the door 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.400
 I am 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.400
 Hmm 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.470
 Hmm 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.740
 Hmm 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.740
 here we go 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:37.090
 Please be only one person villagers to isolate the above 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.590
 If you come up safely 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:52.040
 I will not be able to go out with a fence 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.040
 And please do not let other villagers rise 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:00.960
 This is the completion of the raised floor type infinite multiplication facility 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.460
 It is ok if the degree of positive attitude rises and the heart mark comes out 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:16.500
 If you do not know how to increase your aggressiveness 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.500
 Please refer to the door increase ceremony introduced before 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:24.450
 This is survival 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.450
 I made the same thing and tried it 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.350
 Hmm 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.530
 Hmm 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.470
 Hmm 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.870
 What 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.870
 Ha ha ha ha 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.170
 stood 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.670
 Breeding flag is on safely 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:06.069
 As we can make immediately as well as digging type 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.580
 Please refer to those who want to increase the number of villagers 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.390
 The 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.390
 that's all
