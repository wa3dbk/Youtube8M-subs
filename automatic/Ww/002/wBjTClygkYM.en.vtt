00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
take a look at the planet work on how to

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.709 
take a look at the planet work on how to
get<00:00:07.770> there<00:00:07.980> and<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.730> gear<00:00:09.150> that's<00:00:09.450> available

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
get there and the gear that's available

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.009 
get there and the gear that's available
under<00:00:10.139> vendors<00:00:10.590> so<00:00:11.210> you<00:00:12.210> can<00:00:12.330> get<00:00:12.450> there<00:00:12.630> one

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
under vendors so you can get there one

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.839 
under vendors so you can get there one
of<00:00:13.139> two<00:00:13.290> ways<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.950> first<00:00:14.130> time<00:00:14.429> you<00:00:14.549> go<00:00:14.670> there

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
of two ways the first time you go there

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.490 
of two ways the first time you go there
you<00:00:15.059> have<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.450> go<00:00:15.540> through<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.809> galaxy<00:00:16.080> map<00:00:16.289> it

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
you have to go through the galaxy map it

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.019 
you have to go through the galaxy map it
doesn't<00:00:16.770> look<00:00:16.859> like<00:00:17.010> they<00:00:17.250> activate<00:00:17.760> the

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
doesn't look like they activate the

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.179 
doesn't look like they activate the
mission<00:00:18.720> terminal<00:00:19.109> thing<00:00:19.380> that's<00:00:19.740> on<00:00:19.920> fleet

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
mission terminal thing that's on fleet

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.269 
mission terminal thing that's on fleet
until<00:00:20.609> you<00:00:20.699> actually<00:00:20.880> go<00:00:21.119> there<00:00:21.180> once<00:00:22.010> so<00:00:23.010> it's

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
until you actually go there once so it's

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.300 
until you actually go there once so it's
up<00:00:23.460> here<00:00:23.820> in<00:00:24.029> like<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.140> SIP<00:00:25.619> area<00:00:26.039> where<00:00:26.189> they

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
up here in like the SIP area where they

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.080 
up here in like the SIP area where they
period<00:00:26.730> fleet<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:27.320> it's<00:00:28.320> off<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:29.160> map<00:00:29.369> totally

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
period fleet is it's off the map totally

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.389 
period fleet is it's off the map totally
and<00:00:30.390> here<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.230> surah<00:00:31.560> con<00:00:31.830> I<00:00:32.040> had<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.250> look

and here it is surah con I had to look
in<00:00:32.640> like<00:00:33.079> six<00:00:34.079> different<00:00:34.320> times<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:35.010> figure

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
in like six different times to figure

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.270 
in like six different times to figure
out<00:00:35.940> exactly<00:00:36.149> where<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.660> was<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.129> know

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.619 
out exactly where it was so so you know
here's<00:00:39.149> plan<00:00:39.480> Oricon<00:00:40.100> it's<00:00:41.100> pretty<00:00:41.370> cool<00:00:41.629> as

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
here's plan Oricon it's pretty cool as

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.020 
here's plan Oricon it's pretty cool as

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
other planets and it costs two thousand

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.369 
other planets and it costs two thousand
six<00:00:46.980> hundred<00:00:47.100> credits<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.760> go<00:00:47.879> there<00:00:51.379> Horicon

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
would definitely like this as a

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.819 
would definitely like this as a
background<00:00:57.210> or<00:00:57.390> something<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.140> really

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
background or something this is a really

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.250 
background or something this is a really
nice<00:00:58.980> picture

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
nice picture

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.369 
nice picture
although<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.520> something<00:01:02.520> about<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.940> like

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
although the something about it like

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.929 
although the something about it like
looks<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.470> little<00:01:04.530> fuzzy<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.220> me<00:01:05.369> but<00:01:05.760> other

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
looks a little fuzzy to me but other

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.719 
looks a little fuzzy to me but other
than<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.360> think<00:01:06.689> this<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.729> awesome

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
than that I think this is a awesome

than that I think this is a awesome
splash<00:01:09.180> screen

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.710

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
yellow kind of seems a little out of

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.730 
yellow kind of seems a little out of
place<00:01:33.300> to<00:01:33.570> me<00:01:35.270> but<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.810> helmet<00:01:37.050> kind<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.560> looks

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
sharper with the black face yeah not the

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.000
