halfway ish through the movie it gets

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.359 
halfway ish through the movie it gets
better<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.290> first<00:01:13.500> half<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.070> like<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.310> said

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
better the first half of it like I said

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.640 
better the first half of it like I said
feels<00:01:14.729> very<00:01:14.970> sort<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.659> silly<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.170> immature<00:01:16.590> is

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
feels very sort of silly and immature is

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.630 
feels very sort of silly and immature is
not<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.950> word<00:01:17.100> but<00:01:17.310> hopefully<00:01:17.580> you

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
not the word but hopefully you

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.190 
not the word but hopefully you
understand<00:01:17.939> what<00:01:18.030> I'm<00:01:18.119> saying<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.570> then<00:01:19.049> it

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
understand what I'm saying and then it

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.020 
understand what I'm saying and then it
gets<00:01:19.409> better<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.799> has<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.130> same<00:01:20.310> tone<00:01:20.700> that

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
gets better it has the same tone that

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.920 
gets better it has the same tone that
very<00:01:21.509> glossy<00:01:21.840> tone<00:01:22.409> but<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.430> think<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.360> the

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
very glossy tone but I think that the

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.300 
very glossy tone but I think that the
story<00:01:25.290> got<00:01:25.560> better<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:25.950> got<00:01:25.979> more

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
story got better and I got more

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.770 
story got better and I got more
interested<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:26.759> more<00:01:26.939> invested<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.630> kind

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
interested and more invested and it kind

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.539 
interested and more invested and it kind
of<00:01:27.810> almost<00:01:27.990> backtracked<00:01:28.860> on<00:01:28.950> itself<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.400> made

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
of almost backtracked on itself and made

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.910 
of almost backtracked on itself and made
the<00:01:29.700> rest<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.180> enjoyable<00:01:31.079> even<00:01:31.710> though<00:01:31.890> I

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
the rest of it enjoyable even though I

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.560 
the rest of it enjoyable even though I
kind<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.310> was<00:01:32.460> iffy<00:01:32.790> on<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:33.090> while<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.329> was

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
kind of was iffy on it while I was

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.819 
kind of was iffy on it while I was
watching<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.079> it's<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.320> little<00:01:34.500> bit<00:01:34.590> hard<00:01:34.770> to

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
watching it it's a little bit hard to

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.200 
watching it it's a little bit hard to
explain<00:01:35.100> but<00:01:35.310> let<00:01:35.430> me<00:01:35.520> give<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.790> shot<00:01:36.000> by

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
explain but let me give it a shot by

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.090 
explain but let me give it a shot by
starting<00:01:36.720> off<00:01:36.900> with<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.470> writing<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.040> the

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
starting off with the writing and the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.899 
starting off with the writing and the
plot<00:01:38.490> which<00:01:39.119> was<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.990> think<00:01:40.049> good<00:01:40.890> enough<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.700> is

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
plot which was I think good enough it is

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.520 
plot which was I think good enough it is
called<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.390> first<00:01:42.600> time<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.500> is

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.190 
little harder to relate to this movie
because<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.729> doesn't<00:02:03.329> feel<00:02:03.450> very<00:02:03.719> realistic

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
because it doesn't feel very realistic

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.020 
because it doesn't feel very realistic
it<00:02:04.320> feels<00:02:04.590> kind<00:02:04.979> of<00:02:05.040> like<00:02:05.219> looking<00:02:05.820> back<00:02:05.880> on

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
it feels kind of like looking back on

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.300 
it feels kind of like looking back on
high<00:02:06.390> school<00:02:06.450> your<00:02:07.110> fantasy<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:08.009> what<00:02:08.190> you

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
high school your fantasy of what you

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.249 
high school your fantasy of what you
wish<00:02:08.520> highschool<00:02:09.090> could<00:02:09.360> have<00:02:09.539> been<00:02:09.840> but<00:02:10.170> it

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
wish highschool could have been but it

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.170 
wish highschool could have been but it
does<00:02:10.410> have<00:02:10.619> awkwardness<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:11.550> awkward<00:02:11.970> you

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
does have awkwardness and awkward you

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.590 
does have awkwardness and awkward you
know<00:02:12.300> move

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
know move

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.720 
know move
dates<00:02:12.930> and<00:02:13.140> stuff<00:02:13.320> like<00:02:13.470> that<00:02:13.680> so<00:02:13.920> on<00:02:14.160> some

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
dates and stuff like that so on some

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.130 
dates and stuff like that so on some
level<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:15.090> felt<00:02:15.330> very<00:02:15.480> unrealistic<00:02:15.840> on

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
level it felt very unrealistic on

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.080 
level it felt very unrealistic on
another<00:02:16.350> level<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.800> felt<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.250> little<00:02:17.670> more<00:02:17.820> in

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
another level it felt a little more in

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.550 
another level it felt a little more in
line<00:02:18.300> with<00:02:18.510> something<00:02:18.750> I<00:02:18.930> could<00:02:19.080> relate<00:02:19.320> to

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
line with something I could relate to

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.410 
line with something I could relate to
but<00:02:19.830> overall<00:02:20.220> unfortunately<00:02:20.910> like<00:02:21.030> I<00:02:21.090> said<00:02:21.300> it

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
but overall unfortunately like I said it

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.990 
but overall unfortunately like I said it
does<00:02:21.600> kind<00:02:21.840> of<00:02:21.900> have<00:02:22.050> this<00:02:22.310> glassy<00:02:23.310> tone<00:02:23.640> and

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
does kind of have this glassy tone and

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.580 
does kind of have this glassy tone and
that<00:02:24.150> is<00:02:24.360> kind<00:02:24.750> of<00:02:24.780> in<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:24.960> writing<00:02:25.230> but<00:02:25.350> more

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
that is kind of in the writing but more

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.780 
that is kind of in the writing but more
so<00:02:25.830> in<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:26.310> directing<00:02:27.120> which<00:02:27.660> was<00:02:28.790> definitely

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
so in the directing which was definitely

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.340 
so in the directing which was definitely
weird<00:02:29.940> it<00:02:30.150> did<00:02:30.360> kind<00:02:30.660> of<00:02:30.750> feel<00:02:30.930> like<00:02:30.960> a

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
weird it did kind of feel like a

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.080 
weird it did kind of feel like a
Nickelodeon<00:02:31.890> romance<00:02:32.550> movie<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.000> hopefully

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
Nickelodeon romance movie and hopefully

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.490 
Nickelodeon romance movie and hopefully
you<00:02:33.330> understand<00:02:33.600> what<00:02:33.690> I<00:02:33.750> mean<00:02:33.900> by<00:02:33.960> that<00:02:34.260> I

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
you understand what I mean by that I

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.550 
you understand what I mean by that I
mean<00:02:35.300> childish<00:02:36.300> I<00:02:36.570> guess<00:02:36.900> and<00:02:37.200> that's<00:02:37.260> not<00:02:37.440> the

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
mean childish I guess and that's not the

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.720 
mean childish I guess and that's not the
right<00:02:37.590> word<00:02:37.860> either<00:02:38.010> but<00:02:38.310> I'm<00:02:38.430> sure<00:02:38.610> you

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
right word either but I'm sure you

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:39.890 
right word either but I'm sure you
understand<00:02:39.060> what<00:02:39.150> I'm<00:02:39.240> saying<00:02:39.450> by<00:02:39.570> this<00:02:39.630> point

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
understand what I'm saying by this point

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.270 
understand what I'm saying by this point
now<00:02:40.110> there<00:02:40.230> is<00:02:40.350> something<00:02:40.710> in<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:40.950> writing

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
now there is something in the writing

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.490 
now there is something in the writing
and<00:02:41.460> directing<00:02:41.610> which<00:02:42.120> it's<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.600> same<00:02:42.900> guy<00:02:43.080> so

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
and directing which it's the same guy so

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.920 
and directing which it's the same guy so
it<00:02:43.770> doesn't<00:02:44.070> really<00:02:44.160> matter<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:44.730> makes<00:02:45.690> me

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
it doesn't really matter that makes me

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.620 
it doesn't really matter that makes me
think<00:02:46.260> this<00:02:46.680> might<00:02:47.130> be<00:02:47.160> why<00:02:47.490> it<00:02:47.550> feels<00:02:48.000> sort<00:02:48.480> of

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
think this might be why it feels sort of

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.450 
think this might be why it feels sort of
childish<00:02:49.260> or<00:02:49.410> immature<00:02:49.860> or<00:02:49.980> whatever<00:02:50.250> word

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
childish or immature or whatever word

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.620 
childish or immature or whatever word
you<00:02:50.490> want<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.820> use<00:02:50.880> that<00:02:51.180> might<00:02:51.330> be<00:02:51.360> better

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
you want to use that might be better

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.110 
you want to use that might be better
than<00:02:51.840> those<00:02:52.020> and<00:02:52.380> that<00:02:53.130> is<00:02:53.460> the<00:02:53.760> fact<00:02:53.970> that

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
than those and that is the fact that

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.340 
than those and that is the fact that
they<00:02:54.330> say<00:02:54.630> words<00:02:54.900> like<00:02:55.110> doink<00:02:55.860> as<00:02:56.130> in<00:02:57.200> to<00:02:58.200> have

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
they say words like doink as in to have

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.520 
they say words like doink as in to have
sex<00:02:58.620> with<00:02:58.800> that's<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.490> definition<00:02:59.640> of<00:03:00.030> doink

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
sex with that's the definition of doink

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.380 
sex with that's the definition of doink
gnarly<00:03:01.530> words<00:03:02.190> that<00:03:02.430> you<00:03:02.490> really<00:03:02.820> don't<00:03:03.090> hear

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
gnarly words that you really don't hear

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.110 
gnarly words that you really don't hear
kids<00:03:03.720> saying<00:03:04.080> often<00:03:04.770> and<00:03:05.040> it<00:03:05.460> kind<00:03:05.820> of<00:03:05.850> felt

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
kids saying often and it kind of felt

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.060 
kids saying often and it kind of felt
like<00:03:06.180> it<00:03:06.450> was<00:03:06.600> almost<00:03:06.810> an<00:03:07.140> out-of-touch

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
like it was almost an out-of-touch

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.030 
like it was almost an out-of-touch
element<00:03:09.060> which<00:03:09.510> I<00:03:09.690> think<00:03:09.930> would<00:03:10.080> explain<00:03:10.500> sort

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
element which I think would explain sort

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.920 
element which I think would explain sort
of<00:03:11.130> the<00:03:11.220> movie<00:03:11.550> having<00:03:11.820> this<00:03:11.940> odd<00:03:12.120> kind<00:03:12.600> of<00:03:12.750> out

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
of the movie having this odd kind of out

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.890 
of the movie having this odd kind of out
of<00:03:12.960> touch<00:03:13.230> with<00:03:13.440> reality<00:03:14.030> feeling<00:03:15.030> to<00:03:15.240> it<00:03:15.390> but

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
of touch with reality feeling to it but

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.720 
of touch with reality feeling to it but
then<00:03:16.020> again<00:03:16.050> that<00:03:16.890> might<00:03:17.100> be<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.340> point<00:03:17.490> maybe

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
then again that might be the point maybe

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:18.860 
then again that might be the point maybe
it<00:03:17.910> is<00:03:18.000> supposed<00:03:18.300> to<00:03:18.360> be<00:03:18.420> almost<00:03:18.630> like<00:03:18.750> a

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
it is supposed to be almost like a

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.720 
it is supposed to be almost like a
fantasy<00:03:19.290> looking<00:03:19.920> back<00:03:20.070> in<00:03:20.250> high<00:03:20.400> school

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
fantasy looking back in high school

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.120 
fantasy looking back in high school
I<00:03:20.850> don't<00:03:21.060> know<00:03:21.240> but<00:03:21.840> that<00:03:22.440> kind<00:03:22.830> of<00:03:22.860> threw<00:03:23.010> me

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
I don't know but that kind of threw me

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.760 
I don't know but that kind of threw me
off<00:03:23.160> because<00:03:23.310> I<00:03:23.700> couldn't<00:03:24.180> relate<00:03:24.510> to<00:03:24.840> some<00:03:25.740> of

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
off because I couldn't relate to some of

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.560 
off because I couldn't relate to some of
those<00:03:25.950> elements<00:03:26.430> like<00:03:26.700> I<00:03:26.790> said<00:03:27.030> I<00:03:27.060> do<00:03:27.180> think<00:03:27.480> it

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
those elements like I said I do think it

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.300 
those elements like I said I do think it
got<00:03:27.720> better<00:03:27.930> around<00:03:28.290> halfway<00:03:28.740> through<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:29.250> it

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
got better around halfway through and it

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.620 
got better around halfway through and it
made<00:03:29.430> me<00:03:29.550> appreciate<00:03:29.730> the<00:03:30.030> movie<00:03:30.390> overall

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
made me appreciate the movie overall

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.270 
made me appreciate the movie overall
because<00:03:30.990> I<00:03:31.110> got<00:03:31.290> interested<00:03:31.980> in<00:03:32.190> the

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
because I got interested in the

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.710 
because I got interested in the
characters<00:03:32.670> and<00:03:32.700> invested<00:03:33.180> in<00:03:33.270> their<00:03:33.390> story

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
characters and invested in their story

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.870 
characters and invested in their story
and<00:03:33.990> kind<00:03:34.410> of<00:03:34.500> fell<00:03:35.010> in<00:03:35.130> love<00:03:35.310> with<00:03:35.430> them<00:03:35.640> but

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
and kind of fell in love with them but

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.060 
and kind of fell in love with them but
not<00:03:36.120> that<00:03:36.480> dramatic<00:03:36.720> and<00:03:37.200> that<00:03:37.440> of<00:03:37.620> course<00:03:37.650> has

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
not that dramatic and that of course has

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.830 
not that dramatic and that of course has
to<00:03:38.160> do<00:03:38.250> with<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.460> acting<00:03:38.820> as<00:03:38.940> well<00:03:39.150> but<00:03:39.660> this

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
to do with the acting as well but this

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.510 
to do with the acting as well but this
is<00:03:39.900> where<00:03:40.140> that<00:03:40.260> kind<00:03:40.410> of<00:03:40.500> glossy<00:03:41.010> bubblegum

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
is where that kind of glossy bubblegum

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.330 
is where that kind of glossy bubblegum
feeling<00:03:42.060> still<00:03:42.660> continues<00:03:43.350> because<00:03:43.560> your<00:03:44.130> two

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
feeling still continues because your two

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.150 
feeling still continues because your two
leads<00:03:44.700> look<00:03:45.360> like<00:03:45.810> actors<00:03:46.410> and<00:03:46.650> I<00:03:46.770> always<00:03:46.920> hate

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
leads look like actors and I always hate

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.500 
leads look like actors and I always hate
saying<00:03:47.430> that<00:03:47.580> because<00:03:47.700> it's<00:03:47.880> not<00:03:47.970> fair<00:03:48.300> they

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
saying that because it's not fair they

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.730 
saying that because it's not fair they
look<00:03:48.720> the<00:03:48.810> way<00:03:48.840> they<00:03:48.930> look<00:03:49.230> you<00:03:49.500> know<00:03:49.590> what<00:03:49.680> I

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
look the way they look you know what I

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.410 
look the way they look you know what I
mean<00:03:49.860> but<00:03:50.130> that<00:03:50.160> aside<00:03:50.640> I<00:03:50.700> do<00:03:50.940> think<00:03:51.210> they<00:03:51.270> did

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
mean but that aside I do think they did

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.790 
mean but that aside I do think they did
a<00:03:51.450> good<00:03:51.600> job<00:03:51.660> at<00:03:52.110> kind<00:03:52.320> of<00:03:52.380> handling<00:03:52.680> the

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
a good job at kind of handling the

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.300 
a good job at kind of handling the
awkwardness

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
awkwardness

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.940 
awkwardness
I<00:03:53.430> thought<00:03:53.910> Britt<00:03:54.210> Robertson<00:03:54.360> was<00:03:55.260> a<00:03:55.500> little

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
I thought Britt Robertson was a little

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.030 
I thought Britt Robertson was a little
bit<00:03:56.130> too<00:03:56.430> much<00:03:56.750> in<00:03:57.750> some<00:03:58.110> spots<00:03:58.410> like<00:03:58.710> a<00:03:58.740> little

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
bit too much in some spots like a little

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.360 
bit too much in some spots like a little
bit<00:03:59.160> too<00:03:59.550> desperate<00:04:00.480> to<00:04:00.870> be<00:04:01.080> awkward<00:04:01.830> you<00:04:02.310> know

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
bit too desperate to be awkward you know

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.860 
bit too desperate to be awkward you know
what<00:04:02.490> I<00:04:02.520> mean<00:04:02.670> it<00:04:02.760> felt<00:04:02.970> a<00:04:03.060> little<00:04:03.180> bit<00:04:03.390> off<00:04:03.570> but

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
what I mean it felt a little bit off but

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.080 
what I mean it felt a little bit off but
I<00:04:03.930> think<00:04:04.290> that<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.680> standouts<00:04:05.250> actually<00:04:05.790> were

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
I think that the standouts actually were

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.520 
I think that the standouts actually were
Dave's<00:04:06.510> friends<00:04:06.990> which<00:04:07.140> I<00:04:07.260> thought<00:04:07.410> were

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
Dave's friends which I thought were

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.920 
Dave's friends which I thought were
hilarious<00:04:08.160> and<00:04:08.670> also<00:04:09.060> Victoria<00:04:09.420> justice<00:04:09.810> is

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
hilarious and also Victoria justice is

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.630 
hilarious and also Victoria justice is
in<00:04:10.020> the<00:04:10.110> movie<00:04:10.350> I<00:04:10.500> did<00:04:11.040> not<00:04:11.220> think<00:04:11.460> she<00:04:11.490> was

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
in the movie I did not think she was

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.220 
in the movie I did not think she was
terrible<00:04:12.060> I<00:04:12.270> didn't<00:04:12.690> think<00:04:12.750> she<00:04:12.900> was<00:04:12.990> great

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
terrible I didn't think she was great

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.860 
terrible I didn't think she was great
but<00:04:13.920> she<00:04:14.160> definitely<00:04:14.340> wasn't<00:04:14.610> terrible<00:04:15.060> and<00:04:15.300> I

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
but she definitely wasn't terrible and I

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.870 
but she definitely wasn't terrible and I
thought<00:04:16.590> she<00:04:16.830> might<00:04:17.010> be<00:04:17.040> because<00:04:17.520> hey<00:04:17.700> there

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
thought she might be because hey there

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.580 
thought she might be because hey there
you<00:04:17.970> go<00:04:18.060> that's<00:04:18.210> the<00:04:18.359> Nickelodeon<00:04:18.870> tie<00:04:19.049> I<00:04:19.080> just

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
you go that's the Nickelodeon tie I just

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:20.930 
you go that's the Nickelodeon tie I just
realized<00:04:20.010> I<00:04:20.280> don't<00:04:20.549> know<00:04:20.609> if<00:04:20.669> any<00:04:20.760> of<00:04:20.820> the

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
realized I don't know if any of the

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.340 
realized I don't know if any of the
other<00:04:21.090> actors<00:04:21.390> are<00:04:21.510> on<00:04:21.540> Nickelodeon<00:04:22.109> but<00:04:22.229> they

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
other actors are on Nickelodeon but they

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:23.780 
other actors are on Nickelodeon but they
look<00:04:22.530> like<00:04:22.620> they<00:04:22.770> would<00:04:22.919> be<00:04:22.979> that's<00:04:23.310> my<00:04:23.520> point

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
look like they would be that's my point

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.580 
look like they would be that's my point
I<00:04:24.090> also<00:04:24.240> thought<00:04:24.510> the<00:04:24.660> Ronnie<00:04:24.900> character<00:04:25.440> was

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
I also thought the Ronnie character was

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:26.550 
I also thought the Ronnie character was
funny<00:04:25.919> and

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
funny and

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.590 
funny and
I<00:04:26.590> enjoyed<00:04:27.580> that<00:04:27.790> kind<00:04:27.910> of<00:04:28.000> aspect<00:04:28.150> of<00:04:28.510> the

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
I enjoyed that kind of aspect of the

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.810 
I enjoyed that kind of aspect of the
movie<00:04:28.870> and<00:04:29.050> overall<00:04:29.740> while<00:04:30.010> it<00:04:30.280> did<00:04:30.430> have<00:04:30.639> this

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
movie and overall while it did have this

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.870 
movie and overall while it did have this
kind<00:04:31.060> of<00:04:31.150> weird<00:04:31.480> tone<00:04:31.900> of<00:04:32.700> fantasy<00:04:33.700> high

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
kind of weird tone of fantasy high

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.730 
kind of weird tone of fantasy high
school<00:04:34.330> sort<00:04:34.750> of<00:04:34.840> looking<00:04:35.050> back<00:04:35.260> and<00:04:35.290> dreaming

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
school sort of looking back and dreaming

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.470 
school sort of looking back and dreaming
man<00:04:36.250> if<00:04:36.400> only<00:04:36.490> high<00:04:36.760> school<00:04:37.000> was<00:04:37.150> like<00:04:37.180> this

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
man if only high school was like this

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.030 
man if only high school was like this
which<00:04:37.810> caused<00:04:38.350> it<00:04:38.470> to<00:04:38.530> have<00:04:38.680> this<00:04:38.800> sort<00:04:39.010> of

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
which caused it to have this sort of

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.060 
which caused it to have this sort of
glassy<00:04:39.460> tone<00:04:39.700> that<00:04:40.180> was<00:04:40.389> hard<00:04:40.630> to<00:04:40.900> relate<00:04:41.530> to<00:04:41.590> I

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
glassy tone that was hard to relate to I

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.030 
glassy tone that was hard to relate to I
did<00:04:42.580> enjoy<00:04:42.850> the<00:04:43.000> movie<00:04:43.270> and<00:04:43.480> I<00:04:43.960> thought<00:04:44.800> that
