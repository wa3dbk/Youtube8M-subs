is<00:00:40.170> not<00:00:40.559> only<00:00:40.710> so<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.129> chops<00:00:41.370> can<00:00:41.640> say<00:00:41.790> goodbye

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
is not only so the chops can say goodbye

to<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.450> but<00:00:43.079> also<00:00:43.530> because<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:44.219> thought<00:00:44.520> it

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
to you but also because I thought it

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.670 
to you but also because I thought it
would<00:00:44.789> be<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.940> little<00:00:45.210> less<00:00:45.450> offensive<00:00:45.870> if<00:00:46.289> I

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
would be a little less offensive if I

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.160 
would be a little less offensive if I
wore<00:00:46.890> pants<00:00:47.219> for<00:00:47.520> this<00:00:47.640> one<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:48.090> don't<00:00:48.899> know<00:00:49.050> if
