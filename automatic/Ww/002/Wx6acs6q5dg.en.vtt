kind<00:04:04.480> of<00:04:04.630> makes<00:04:04.750> you<00:04:04.840> wonder<00:04:04.989> if<00:04:05.170> maybe<00:04:05.440> they

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
kind of makes you wonder if maybe they

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.260 
kind of makes you wonder if maybe they
were<00:04:05.650> purchased<00:04:06.130> together<00:04:06.310> or<00:04:06.700> in<00:04:06.850> very<00:04:07.030> close

matched<00:04:10.300> the<00:04:10.480> grill<00:04:10.690> cloth<00:04:10.930> very<00:04:11.200> well<00:04:11.470> and<00:04:12.310> it

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
matched the grill cloth very well and it

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.890 
matched the grill cloth very well and it
was<00:04:12.459> actually<00:04:12.700> much<00:04:13.120> darker<00:04:13.600> where<00:04:13.750> this

two settings on FM there's the monaural

the monaural one first and just tune

the monaural one first and just tune
something<00:05:20.750> in<00:05:20.870> here

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:39.680 

not<00:05:24.770> that<00:05:24.979> I<00:05:25.009> don't<00:05:25.159> think

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.820 

and<00:05:40.170> if<00:05:40.290> I<00:05:40.410> turn<00:05:40.620> it<00:05:40.740> over<00:05:40.800> to<00:05:40.950> FM<00:05:41.280> stereo<00:05:41.610> here

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:50.140 
and if I turn it over to FM stereo here
we<00:05:43.830> might<00:05:44.010> be<00:05:44.190> able<00:05:44.340> to<00:05:44.430> hear<00:05:44.640> the<00:05:44.760> difference

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:06:06.110 

you<00:05:51.150> late-night<00:05:51.720> Rock<00:05:51.979> 97.5<00:06:04.849> okay<00:06:05.849> and<00:06:06.000> then

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
you late-night Rock 97.5 okay and then

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.550 
you late-night Rock 97.5 okay and then
there's<00:06:06.300> the<00:06:06.449> tape<00:06:06.690> setting<00:06:07.199> and<00:06:07.319> the<00:06:07.379> tape

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
there's the tape setting and the tape

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.379 
there's the tape setting and the tape
setting<00:06:07.979> can<00:06:08.129> go<00:06:08.280> two<00:06:08.340> ways<00:06:08.699> on<00:06:09.000> this<00:06:09.150> thing

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:09.389 
setting can go two ways on this thing

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:11.570 
setting can go two ways on this thing
it's<00:06:10.080> my<00:06:10.289> understanding<00:06:10.500> that<00:06:11.009> you<00:06:11.220> can<00:06:11.370> use

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
it's my understanding that you can use

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.790 
it's my understanding that you can use
the<00:06:11.819> built-in<00:06:12.180> eight-track<00:06:12.810> player<00:06:12.840> which<00:06:13.650> I

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
the built-in eight-track player which I

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.499 
the built-in eight-track player which I
have<00:06:14.099> not<00:06:14.340> tested<00:06:14.580> but<00:06:15.000> I'm<00:06:15.090> going<00:06:15.330> to<00:06:15.360> go

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:15.509 
have not tested but I'm going to go

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:17.379 
have not tested but I'm going to go
ahead<00:06:15.780> and<00:06:15.930> try<00:06:16.139> it<00:06:16.169> for<00:06:16.470> the<00:06:16.560> first<00:06:16.770> time<00:06:17.039> here

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:17.389 
ahead and try it for the first time here

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:21.140 
ahead and try it for the first time here
or<00:06:18.389> there's<00:06:19.259> a<00:06:19.379> set<00:06:19.680> of<00:06:19.919> line<00:06:20.129> level<00:06:20.370> inputs<00:06:20.940> on

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.150 
or there's a set of line level inputs on

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.450 
or there's a set of line level inputs on
the<00:06:21.180> back<00:06:21.300> of<00:06:21.630> this<00:06:21.750> thing<00:06:22.190> for<00:06:23.190> tape

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
the back of this thing for tape

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.149 
the back of this thing for tape
recording<00:06:24.000> and<00:06:24.150> playback<00:06:24.360> but<00:06:24.810> I<00:06:24.840> think<00:06:25.319> that

00:06:26.149 --> 00:06:26.159 
recording and playback but I think that

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:28.700 
recording and playback but I think that
if<00:06:26.280> you<00:06:26.430> were<00:06:26.580> to<00:06:26.880> disconnect<00:06:27.449> them<00:06:27.690> from<00:06:27.930> the

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710 
if you were to disconnect them from the

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.089 
if you were to disconnect them from the
tape<00:06:29.370> deck<00:06:29.780> from<00:06:30.780> the<00:06:30.840> eight-track<00:06:31.319> player<00:06:31.349> or

00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:32.099 
tape deck from the eight-track player or

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:34.249 
tape deck from the eight-track player or
whatever<00:06:32.370> is<00:06:32.490> wired<00:06:32.699> into<00:06:33.060> this<00:06:33.180> thing<00:06:33.479> that

00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:34.259 
whatever is wired into this thing that

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:35.420 
whatever is wired into this thing that
you<00:06:34.409> would<00:06:34.560> end<00:06:34.710> up<00:06:34.860> killing<00:06:35.099> the

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:35.430 
you would end up killing the

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.689 
you would end up killing the
functionality<00:06:36.270> of<00:06:36.419> the<00:06:37.020> 8-track<00:06:37.560> deck<00:06:37.889> so

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:38.699 
functionality of the 8-track deck so

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:39.830 
functionality of the 8-track deck so
let's<00:06:38.849> go<00:06:39.000> ahead<00:06:39.120> and<00:06:39.360> see<00:06:39.509> if<00:06:39.539> this<00:06:39.780> thing

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 
let's go ahead and see if this thing

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.899 
let's go ahead and see if this thing
works<00:06:40.289> or<00:06:40.590> if<00:06:40.680> it's<00:06:40.830> in<00:06:40.979> need<00:06:41.190> of<00:06:41.219> belts<00:06:41.639> or<00:06:41.819> if

00:06:41.899 --> 00:06:41.909 
works or if it's in need of belts or if

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:44.360

sounds like it needs a belt it's also
not<00:06:54.260> switching<00:06:54.530> programs<00:06:55.160> so<00:06:55.490> clearly<00:06:56.210> it's

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:56.420 
not switching programs so clearly it's

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:57.640 
not switching programs so clearly it's
going<00:06:56.510> to<00:06:56.810> need<00:06:56.900> a<00:06:56.960> little<00:06:57.170> bit<00:06:57.290> of<00:06:57.350> attention

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:57.650 
going to need a little bit of attention

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.180 
going to need a little bit of attention
and<00:06:58.070> the<00:06:58.250> turntable<00:06:58.850> will<00:06:59.030> as<00:06:59.210> well<00:06:59.860> but<00:07:00.860> this

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:01.190 
and the turntable will as well but this

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.790 
and the turntable will as well but this
is<00:07:01.610> the<00:07:01.940> console<00:07:02.480> that<00:07:02.540> I<00:07:02.870> saved<00:07:03.260> and<00:07:03.560> with<00:07:03.710> a

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:03.800

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.310 
is the console that I saved and with a
little<00:07:04.010> bit<00:07:04.130> of<00:07:04.250> work<00:07:04.430> I<00:07:04.810> think<00:07:05.810> it<00:07:05.930> could<00:07:06.110> be<00:07:06.290> a

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:06.320 
little bit of work I think it could be a

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.680 
little bit of work I think it could be a
really<00:07:06.680> nice<00:07:06.920> piece<00:07:07.280> of<00:07:07.310> equipment<00:07:07.690> once
