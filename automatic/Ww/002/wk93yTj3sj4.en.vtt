in<00:02:53.210> here<00:02:53.330> while<00:02:53.540> I<00:02:53.570> cook<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:53.960> eggs<00:02:54.140> and<00:02:54.440> bacon

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
in here while I cook the eggs and bacon

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.290 
in here while I cook the eggs and bacon
so<00:02:54.890> everything<00:02:55.280> gets<00:02:55.370> plated<00:02:55.850> at<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.090> same

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
so everything gets plated at the same

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:11.620 
so everything gets plated at the same
time<00:02:56.570> so<00:02:56.840> that's<00:02:57.260> that's<00:03:10.030> these<00:03:11.030> silicone

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
time so that's that's these silicone

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.470 
time so that's that's these silicone
molds<00:03:12.080> we<00:03:12.230> used<00:03:13.070> to<00:03:13.220> have<00:03:13.400> these<00:03:13.790> metal<00:03:14.180> ones

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
molds we used to have these metal ones

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.720 
molds we used to have these metal ones
and<00:03:14.690> they<00:03:14.780> were<00:03:14.840> ok<00:03:15.260> they're<00:03:15.650> you<00:03:16.010> know<00:03:16.040> still

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
and they were ok they're you know still

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.460 
and they were ok they're you know still
had<00:03:16.850> the<00:03:17.030> same<00:03:17.270> end<00:03:17.630> result<00:03:17.870> but<00:03:18.260> you'd<00:03:18.440> have

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
had the same end result but you'd have

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.360 
had the same end result but you'd have
to<00:03:18.710> butter<00:03:18.980> and<00:03:20.320> they're<00:03:21.320> noisy<00:03:21.650> and<00:03:22.010> clanking

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
to butter and they're noisy and clanking

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.740 
to butter and they're noisy and clanking
they're<00:03:22.580> especially<00:03:22.760> not<00:03:23.060> as<00:03:23.210> good<00:03:23.360> an<00:03:23.420> RV

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
they're especially not as good an RV

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.500 
they're especially not as good an RV
because<00:03:27.580> these<00:03:28.580> are<00:03:28.760> amazing<00:03:28.970> they<00:03:29.330> don't

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
because these are amazing they don't

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.060 
because these are amazing they don't
they<00:03:30.260> don't<00:03:30.290> stick<00:03:30.770> it<00:03:30.920> all<00:03:31.070> and<00:03:31.520> they

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
they don't stick it all and they

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:39.270 
they don't stick it all and they
lightweight

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.490 

and<00:03:40.030> you<00:03:40.120> just<00:03:40.270> put<00:03:40.480> a<00:03:40.510> little<00:03:40.690> over<00:03:41.050> a<00:03:41.080> third

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
and you just put a little over a third

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:52.590 
and you just put a little over a third
of<00:03:41.620> a<00:03:41.710> cup<00:03:42.030> into<00:03:43.030> each<00:03:43.210> one<00:03:51.450> while<00:03:52.450> you're

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
of a cup into each one while you're

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.000 
of a cup into each one while you're
watching<00:03:52.780> there's<00:03:53.110> actually<00:03:53.470> two<00:03:53.650> different

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
watching there's actually two different

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.490 
watching there's actually two different
sizes<00:03:54.250> of<00:03:54.520> these<00:03:54.760> there's<00:03:55.720> a<00:03:55.810> bigger<00:03:56.080> one<00:03:56.290> and

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
sizes of these there's a bigger one and

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.710 
sizes of these there's a bigger one and
a<00:03:56.530> smaller<00:03:56.920> one<00:03:57.160> I<00:03:57.459> find<00:03:58.120> that<00:03:58.209> these<00:03:58.330> smaller

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
a smaller one I find that these smaller

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.449 
a smaller one I find that these smaller
ones<00:03:58.810> are<00:03:59.080> really<00:03:59.440> nice<00:03:59.590> for<00:03:59.620> eggs<00:04:00.010> these<00:04:00.280> are

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
ones are really nice for eggs these are

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.640 
ones are really nice for eggs these are
nicer<00:04:00.790> for<00:04:00.970> pancakes<00:04:01.360> but<00:04:01.630> either<00:04:02.260> one<00:04:02.470> would

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
nicer for pancakes but either one would

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:14.910 
nicer for pancakes but either one would
work<00:04:12.840> so<00:04:13.840> while<00:04:14.080> the<00:04:14.200> pancakes<00:04:14.590> are<00:04:14.739> cooking

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
work so while the pancakes are cooking

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.039 
work so while the pancakes are cooking
you<00:04:15.550> get<00:04:15.670> a<00:04:15.700> minute<00:04:16.060> or<00:04:16.180> two<00:04:16.329> so<00:04:16.630> you<00:04:16.720> can<00:04:16.870> work

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
you get a minute or two so you can work

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.690 
you get a minute or two so you can work
on<00:04:17.200> other<00:04:17.410> stuff<00:04:17.739> don't<00:04:18.190> do<00:04:18.310> some<00:04:18.489> of<00:04:18.579> your

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
on other stuff don't do some of your

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.720 
on other stuff don't do some of your
initial<00:04:19.060> prep<00:04:19.329> for<00:04:19.739> making<00:04:20.739> a<00:04:20.799> cup<00:04:21.010> of<00:04:21.130> tea<00:04:21.310> or

what<00:04:39.550> the<00:04:39.640> pancakes<00:04:40.030> will<00:04:40.270> start<00:04:40.600> to<00:04:40.750> rise<00:04:40.960> a

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
what the pancakes will start to rise a

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.840 
what the pancakes will start to rise a
little<00:04:41.290> bit<00:04:41.530> and<00:04:41.800> if<00:04:42.310> you've<00:04:42.460> ever<00:04:42.580> made

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.460 
little bit and if you've ever made
pancakes<00:04:43.300> before<00:04:43.419> you'll<00:04:43.810> notice<00:04:44.140> that<00:04:44.290> you

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
pancakes before you'll notice that you

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.440 
pancakes before you'll notice that you
usually<00:04:45.100> get<00:04:45.430> little<00:04:45.669> bubbles<00:04:46.000> on<00:04:46.120> the<00:04:46.240> top

usually get little bubbles on the top
not<00:04:46.900> always<00:04:47.320> but<00:04:48.070> you<00:04:48.580> can<00:04:48.760> see<00:04:48.910> if<00:04:49.000> they<00:04:49.120> start

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
not always but you can see if they start

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.090 
not always but you can see if they start
to<00:04:49.479> set<00:04:49.690> up<00:04:49.840> and<00:04:50.050> then<00:04:50.140> again<00:04:50.410> these<00:04:50.710> molds

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
to set up and then again these molds

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:57.140 
to set up and then again these molds
come<00:04:51.310> off<00:04:51.430> so<00:04:51.700> easy

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.920 

they're<00:04:58.150> also<00:04:58.419> nice<00:04:58.570> because<00:04:58.720> they<00:04:58.810> have

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
they're also nice because they have

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.360 
they're also nice because they have
silicone<00:04:59.350> little<00:04:59.680> knobs<00:04:59.860> up<00:05:00.070> here<00:05:00.220> so<00:05:00.280> you

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370

right off and super smooth you could

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.090 
right off and super smooth you could
just<00:05:10.360> give<00:05:10.479> them<00:05:10.600> a<00:05:10.630> quick<00:05:10.870> wipe<00:05:11.110> down<00:05:11.410> and<00:05:11.650> you
