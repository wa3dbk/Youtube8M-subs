00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:21.579
 the windows in the stores there are you going 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:24.660
 can't imagine it all started 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:29.009
 as a fight in a shop window in one of the shops 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:31.479

 the very bottom and here she appeared I thought 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:07.269
 asked here then began my eternal 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:11.870
 love she was tender top delicate and 

00:02:07.269 --> 00:02:15.970
 politely to me or for such nonsense 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.970
 girls I 've never met 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.950

 customers without only with money broke the window 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:50.510
 you gathered people in front of the shop window so 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:53.299
 everyone thought you were selling a ticket 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.030
