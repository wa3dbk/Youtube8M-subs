syrup<00:01:16.270> so<00:01:16.930> I'm<00:01:17.080> going<00:01:17.110> to<00:01:17.290> take<00:01:17.440> some<00:01:17.649> milk<00:01:17.979> on

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
syrup so I'm going to take some milk on

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.630 
syrup so I'm going to take some milk on
the<00:01:19.030> fridge<00:01:19.509> gonna<00:01:20.470> do<00:01:20.740> about<00:01:20.890> quarter<00:01:21.460> of<00:01:21.550> a

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
the fridge gonna do about quarter of a

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.670 
the fridge gonna do about quarter of a
cup<00:01:21.820> now<00:01:22.149> why<00:01:22.660> do<00:01:22.720> you<00:01:22.810> use<00:01:22.990> have<00:01:23.259> enough<00:01:23.500> as

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
cup now why do you use have enough as

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.560 
cup now why do you use have enough as
opposed<00:01:24.009> to<00:01:24.190> regular<00:01:24.310> milk<00:01:24.670> half-and-half<00:01:25.030> is

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
opposed to regular milk half-and-half is

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.100 
opposed to regular milk half-and-half is
a<00:01:25.600> little<00:01:25.899> bit<00:01:26.020> richer<00:01:26.560> than<00:01:27.100> whole<00:01:27.490> milk

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
a little bit richer than whole milk

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.210 
a little bit richer than whole milk
that's<00:01:29.110> the<00:01:29.260> main<00:01:29.440> reason<00:01:29.470> I<00:01:29.770> mean<00:01:29.920> you<00:01:29.979> want<00:01:30.130> a

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
that's the main reason I mean you want a

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.070 
that's the main reason I mean you want a
little<00:01:30.370> bit<00:01:30.520> higher<00:01:30.760> fat<00:01:31.150> content<00:01:31.420> so<00:01:31.960> it

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
little bit higher fat content so it

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.770 
little bit higher fat content so it
really<00:01:32.790> doesn't<00:01:33.790> seize<00:01:34.180> up<00:01:34.420> the<00:01:34.540> chocolate

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
really doesn't seize up the chocolate

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.560 
really doesn't seize up the chocolate
got<00:01:35.290> it<00:01:38.310> yeah<00:01:39.310> how<00:01:39.729> it's<00:01:39.940> starting<00:01:40.150> to<00:01:40.420> melt

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
got it yeah how it's starting to melt

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.380 
got it yeah how it's starting to melt
they're<00:01:41.430> just<00:01:42.430> kind<00:01:42.580> of<00:01:42.640> want<00:01:42.820> to<00:01:42.880> stir<00:01:43.119> it<00:01:43.270> up
