into the next of devices let's take a

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.859 
into the next of devices let's take a
look<00:01:11.790> at<00:01:11.880> our<00:01:11.970> camera<00:01:12.240> settings<00:01:14.630> for<00:01:15.630> today's

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
look at our camera settings for today's

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.870 
look at our camera settings for today's
shot<00:01:16.140> we're<00:01:16.920> going<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.250> use<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.549> camera<00:01:17.820> on

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
shot we're going to use the camera on

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.140 
shot we're going to use the camera on
manual<00:01:18.409> which<00:01:19.409> means<00:01:19.680> we<00:01:20.070> set<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.460> f-stop<00:01:20.909> and

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
manual which means we set the f-stop and

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.690 
manual which means we set the f-stop and
the<00:01:21.570> aperture<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.710> turn<00:01:22.950> your<00:01:23.100> dial<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.490> M

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
the aperture so turn your dial to M

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.580 
the aperture so turn your dial to M
which<00:01:24.270> put<00:01:24.540> your<00:01:24.689> camera<00:01:24.930> in<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.439> manual<00:01:25.860> mode

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
which put your camera in the manual mode

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.050 
which put your camera in the manual mode
so<00:01:28.590> now<00:01:28.770> we<00:01:28.829> need<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.130> manually<00:01:29.640> set<00:01:29.909> the

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
so now we need to manually set the

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.270 
so now we need to manually set the
camera<00:01:30.420> with<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.780> clamp<00:01:31.020> lamp<00:01:31.320> on<00:01:31.530> we're

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
camera with the clamp lamp on we're

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.310 
camera with the clamp lamp on we're
going<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.610> open<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:33.060> aperture<00:01:33.360> as<00:01:33.750> wide<00:01:34.049> as<00:01:34.200> it

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
going to open the aperture as wide as it

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.940 
going to open the aperture as wide as it
will<00:01:34.470> go<00:01:34.970> 5.6<00:01:35.970> still<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.930> cursor<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.470> way

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
will go 5.6 still the cursor is way

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.819 
will go 5.6 still the cursor is way
underexposed<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:39.390> we<00:01:39.570> slow<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.229> speeds<00:01:40.530> down

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
underexposed so we slow the speeds down

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.740 
underexposed so we slow the speeds down
until<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.369> cursor<00:01:41.759> comes<00:01:41.939> across<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.570> the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
until that cursor comes across to the

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.050 
until that cursor comes across to the
middle<00:01:42.869> point<00:01:43.320> indicating<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.430> proper

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
middle point indicating a proper

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.230 
middle point indicating a proper
exposure<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:46.100> as<00:01:47.100> we<00:01:47.250> can<00:01:47.399> see<00:01:47.460> that's<00:01:47.850> one

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
exposure and as we can see that's one

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.380 
exposure and as we can see that's one
quarter<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.750> second<00:01:49.170> at<00:01:49.290> 5.6<00:01:50.130> let's<00:01:51.060> look<00:01:51.270> at

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
quarter of a second at 5.6 let's look at

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.100 
quarter of a second at 5.6 let's look at
our<00:01:51.479> lens<00:01:51.720> settings<00:01:53.329> we<00:01:54.329> have<00:01:54.479> our<00:01:54.600> stabilizer

on the object that is farthest from the
camera<00:02:25.960> that's<00:02:26.960> much<00:02:27.290> better<00:02:27.560> now<00:02:28.220> your<00:02:28.520> eye

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
camera that's much better now your eye

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.700 
camera that's much better now your eye
is<00:02:28.730> drawn<00:02:29.120> into<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:29.660> shot<00:02:32.200> let's<00:02:33.200> take<00:02:33.440> a<00:02:33.470> look

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
is drawn into the shot let's take a look

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.260 
is drawn into the shot let's take a look
at<00:02:33.800> these<00:02:33.920> two<00:02:34.130> shots<00:02:34.370> together<00:02:35.440> in<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:38.030> shot

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
at these two shots together in the shot

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.210 
at these two shots together in the shot
on<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.510> Left<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:39.050> foreground<00:02:39.440> object<00:02:39.950> is<00:02:40.100> in

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
on the Left the foreground object is in

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.520 
on the Left the foreground object is in
focus<00:02:40.430> which<00:02:40.970> stops<00:02:41.270> your<00:02:41.540> eye<00:02:41.570> right<00:02:41.930> in<00:02:42.200> the

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
focus which stops your eye right in the

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.310 
focus which stops your eye right in the
front<00:02:42.800> in<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.910> shot<00:02:44.270> on<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.540> right<00:02:44.750> the

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
front in the shot on the right the

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.170 
front in the shot on the right the
background<00:02:45.890> object<00:02:46.340> is<00:02:46.490> in<00:02:46.670> focus<00:02:46.850> which

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
background object is in focus which

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.570 
background object is in focus which
draws<00:02:47.510> you<00:02:47.750> into<00:02:47.990> the<00:02:48.260> shot<00:02:48.500> a<00:02:48.770> much<00:02:49.280> better

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
draws you into the shot a much better

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.180 
draws you into the shot a much better
solution<00:02:50.030> I<00:02:50.540> think<00:02:51.140> we're<00:02:51.530> over<00:02:51.650> all<00:02:51.920> a<00:02:51.950> bit

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
solution I think we're over all a bit

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.020 
solution I think we're over all a bit
dark<00:02:52.460> so<00:02:52.880> let's<00:02:53.060> fix<00:02:53.330> that<00:02:53.600> problem<00:02:54.850> with<00:02:55.850> the

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
dark so let's fix that problem with the

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.390 
dark so let's fix that problem with the
f-stop<00:02:56.420> as<00:02:56.720> wide<00:02:57.080> open<00:02:57.440> as<00:02:57.560> it<00:02:57.680> will<00:02:57.800> go<00:02:57.950> we'll

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
f-stop as wide open as it will go we'll

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.070 
f-stop as wide open as it will go we'll
add<00:02:58.610> more<00:02:58.640> light<00:02:59.120> by<00:02:59.390> slowing<00:02:59.720> down<00:02:59.870> the

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
add more light by slowing down the

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.230 
add more light by slowing down the
shutter<00:03:00.440> speed<00:03:00.620> two<00:03:01.370> clicks<00:03:01.730> to<00:03:01.820> the<00:03:02.030> plus

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
shutter speed two clicks to the plus

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.490 
shutter speed two clicks to the plus
side<00:03:02.600> gives<00:03:03.380> us<00:03:03.560> four<00:03:03.830> tenths<00:03:04.100> of<00:03:04.310> a<00:03:04.520> second<00:03:04.910> a

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
side gives us four tenths of a second a

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.360 
side gives us four tenths of a second a
2/3<00:03:06.500> of<00:03:06.740> a<00:03:06.860> stop<00:03:07.130> difference<00:03:08.920> so<00:03:09.920> we've<00:03:10.100> set

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
2/3 of a stop difference so we've set

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.240 
2/3 of a stop difference so we've set
the<00:03:10.580> camera<00:03:10.940> two<00:03:11.210> clicks<00:03:11.510> to<00:03:11.600> the<00:03:11.720> right

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
the camera two clicks to the right

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.910 
the camera two clicks to the right
brightening<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.370> shot<00:03:13.660> so<00:03:14.660> sometimes<00:03:15.200> you

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
brightening the shot so sometimes you

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.190 
brightening the shot so sometimes you
don't<00:03:16.130> want<00:03:16.250> to<00:03:16.520> shoot<00:03:16.790> at<00:03:17.000> exactly<00:03:17.780> what<00:03:17.990> your

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
don't want to shoot at exactly what your

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.460 
don't want to shoot at exactly what your
exposure<00:03:18.560> meter<00:03:18.890> says<00:03:20.020> let's<00:03:21.020> take<00:03:21.320> an

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
exposure meter says let's take an

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:28.750 
exposure meter says let's take an
exposure<00:03:26.260> in<00:03:27.260> this<00:03:27.470> case<00:03:27.709> brighter<00:03:28.130> is<00:03:28.430> better

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
exposure in this case brighter is better

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.660 
exposure in this case brighter is better
making<00:03:29.720> it<00:03:29.900> a<00:03:29.990> cleaner<00:03:30.260> shot<00:03:30.620> and<00:03:30.920> showing

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
making it a cleaner shot and showing

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.010 
making it a cleaner shot and showing
more<00:03:31.870> translucency<00:03:32.870> in<00:03:33.140> the<00:03:33.530> glass<00:03:35.020> although

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
more translucency in the glass although

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.080 
more translucency in the glass although
its<00:03:36.200> overall<00:03:36.560> brighter<00:03:37.070> it's<00:03:37.520> still<00:03:37.820> a<00:03:37.850> bit

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
its overall brighter it's still a bit

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.840 
its overall brighter it's still a bit
dark<00:03:38.330> on<00:03:38.480> the<00:03:38.570> foreground<00:03:39.040> so<00:03:40.040> let's<00:03:40.250> fix<00:03:40.490> that

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.990 

I'm<00:03:43.850> going<00:03:44.120> to<00:03:44.180> go<00:03:44.330> in<00:03:44.630> and<00:03:44.950> put<00:03:45.950> a<00:03:45.980> large<00:03:46.400> white

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
I'm going to go in and put a large white

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.660 
I'm going to go in and put a large white
fill<00:03:47.390> card<00:03:47.810> right<00:03:48.620> underneath<00:03:49.040> the<00:03:49.190> camera<00:03:49.430> in

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
fill card right underneath the camera in

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.330 
fill card right underneath the camera in
the<00:03:49.790> front<00:03:50.380> bouncing<00:03:51.380> light<00:03:51.590> back<00:03:51.920> into<00:03:52.250> the

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
the front bouncing light back into the

the front bouncing light back into the
front<00:03:52.580> of<00:03:52.730> the<00:03:52.820> objects<00:03:53.950> let's<00:03:54.950> shoot<00:03:55.220> one

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:55.490 
front of the objects let's shoot one

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:02.230 
front of the objects let's shoot one
here<00:03:59.680> well<00:04:00.680> that<00:04:00.830> did<00:04:01.040> not<00:04:01.070> work<00:04:01.430> well<00:04:01.730> it

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.240 
here well that did not work well it

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.900 
here well that did not work well it
completely<00:04:02.959> flattened<00:04:03.470> out<00:04:03.590> the<00:04:03.770> shot<00:04:04.040> let's

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
completely flattened out the shot let's

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.790 
completely flattened out the shot let's
try<00:04:05.120> something<00:04:05.390> different<00:04:05.630> let's<00:04:06.380> take<00:04:06.620> the

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
try something different let's take the

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.740 
try something different let's take the
fill<00:04:07.010> card<00:04:07.310> around<00:04:07.640> to<00:04:07.850> the<00:04:07.970> left<00:04:08.150> side<00:04:08.390> and

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
fill card around to the left side and

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.030 
fill card around to the left side and
not<00:04:08.989> have<00:04:09.230> one<00:04:09.260> in<00:04:09.470> the<00:04:09.770> front<00:04:10.040> at<00:04:10.250> all<00:04:11.950> so<00:04:12.950> I'm

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
not have one in the front at all so I'm

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.410 
not have one in the front at all so I'm
going<00:04:13.250> to<00:04:13.340> take<00:04:13.520> that<00:04:13.670> front<00:04:13.970> card<00:04:14.209> away

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
going to take that front card away

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.699 
going to take that front card away
completely<00:04:14.660> and<00:04:15.170> use<00:04:15.709> it<00:04:15.860> as<00:04:15.980> a<00:04:16.010> side<00:04:16.340> card

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
completely and use it as a side card

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.370 
completely and use it as a side card
towards<00:04:18.709> the<00:04:18.799> front<00:04:19.010> edge<00:04:19.130> of<00:04:19.250> the<00:04:19.310> set

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
towards the front edge of the set

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.230 
towards the front edge of the set
bouncing<00:04:21.380> light<00:04:21.590> in<00:04:21.799> to<00:04:22.040> fill<00:04:22.280> in<00:04:22.400> shadows<00:04:22.430> on

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
bouncing light in to fill in shadows on

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.900 
bouncing light in to fill in shadows on
our<00:04:23.900> objects

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:35.800 

let's<00:04:28.910> take<00:04:29.240> our<00:04:29.540> next<00:04:29.810> exposure<00:04:34.810> that's

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
let's take our next exposure that's

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.260 
let's take our next exposure that's
working<00:04:36.380> let's<00:04:37.220> do<00:04:37.370> the<00:04:37.490> same<00:04:37.670> thing<00:04:37.730> to<00:04:38.150> the

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
working let's do the same thing to the

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.620 
working let's do the same thing to the
right<00:04:38.390> side<00:04:38.690> of<00:04:38.720> the<00:04:38.990> set

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.660 

so<00:04:42.630> we<00:04:42.750> take<00:04:42.960> another<00:04:43.230> white<00:04:43.830> card<00:04:44.160> the<00:04:44.430> same

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
so we take another white card the same

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.660 
so we take another white card the same
size<00:04:44.970> and<00:04:45.590> move<00:04:46.590> into<00:04:46.770> the<00:04:46.980> right<00:04:47.100> side<00:04:47.430> of<00:04:47.580> the

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:47.670 
size and move into the right side of the

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:57.980 
size and move into the right side of the
set<00:04:48.380> mirroring<00:04:49.380> the<00:04:50.100> card<00:04:50.370> on<00:04:50.520> the<00:04:50.610> left<00:04:56.990> let's

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
set mirroring the card on the left let's

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:05.030 
set mirroring the card on the left let's
make<00:04:58.200> an<00:04:58.320> exposure<00:04:58.680> here<00:05:03.560> now<00:05:04.560> we're<00:05:04.770> getting

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
make an exposure here now we're getting

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.490 
make an exposure here now we're getting
there<00:05:05.280> we<00:05:06.090> have<00:05:06.210> brightened<00:05:06.660> it<00:05:06.750> up<00:05:06.870> but<00:05:07.410> it

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
there we have brightened it up but it

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.160 
there we have brightened it up but it
maintains<00:05:07.710> some<00:05:08.250> nice<00:05:08.430> detail<00:05:08.970> let's<00:05:09.900> take<00:05:10.140> a

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.170 
maintains some nice detail let's take a

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.740 
maintains some nice detail let's take a
look<00:05:10.440> at<00:05:10.530> this<00:05:10.740> shot<00:05:11.040> and<00:05:11.310> our<00:05:11.850> shot<00:05:12.210> with<00:05:12.450> just

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
look at this shot and our shot with just

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.400 
look at this shot and our shot with just
the<00:05:12.900> front<00:05:13.170> fill<00:05:13.500> together<00:05:14.840> our<00:05:15.840> shot<00:05:16.170> on<00:05:16.320> the

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
the front fill together our shot on the

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.670 
the front fill together our shot on the
left<00:05:16.590> with<00:05:17.460> the<00:05:17.610> front<00:05:17.910> fill<00:05:18.210> card<00:05:18.540> is<00:05:18.870> flat

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
left with the front fill card is flat

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.220 
left with the front fill card is flat
and<00:05:19.950> without<00:05:20.250> detail<00:05:20.760> as<00:05:21.060> I've<00:05:21.750> shot<00:05:21.990> on<00:05:22.110> the

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
and without detail as I've shot on the

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.890 
and without detail as I've shot on the
right<00:05:22.260> with<00:05:22.830> the<00:05:22.980> side<00:05:23.220> fill<00:05:23.520> cards<00:05:24.090> maintains

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
right with the side fill cards maintains

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.580 
right with the side fill cards maintains
much<00:05:25.740> better<00:05:26.070> detail<00:05:26.780> let's<00:05:27.780> add<00:05:27.990> one<00:05:28.020> more

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
much better detail let's add one more

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.520 
much better detail let's add one more
card<00:05:29.000> I'm<00:05:30.000> going<00:05:30.270> to<00:05:30.390> go<00:05:30.510> back<00:05:30.720> and<00:05:31.020> add<00:05:31.500> a

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
card I'm going to go back and add a

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.160 
card I'm going to go back and add a
front<00:05:31.980> fill<00:05:32.190> card<00:05:32.600> but<00:05:33.600> it'll<00:05:33.840> be<00:05:33.960> much

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.170 
front fill card but it'll be much

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.380 
front fill card but it'll be much
smaller<00:05:34.590> and<00:05:35.040> lower<00:05:35.790> down

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:36.390 
smaller and lower down

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.440 
smaller and lower down
so<00:05:36.510> we'll<00:05:36.720> bounce<00:05:36.930> less<00:05:37.740> light<00:05:38.070> in<00:05:38.400> so<00:05:39.270> we'll

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:39.450 
so we'll bounce less light in so we'll

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.560 
so we'll bounce less light in so we'll
maintain<00:05:39.660> detail<00:05:40.530> and<00:05:40.830> make<00:05:41.580> our<00:05:41.820> shot<00:05:42.090> a<00:05:42.330> bit

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
maintain detail and make our shot a bit

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:50.450 
maintain detail and make our shot a bit
whiter<00:05:45.470> and<00:05:47.300> here's<00:05:48.300> our<00:05:48.450> final<00:05:48.780> shot<00:05:49.460> using

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
whiter and here's our final shot using

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.240 
whiter and here's our final shot using
one<00:05:50.850> clamp<00:05:51.240> lamp<00:05:51.540> and<00:05:51.840> three<00:05:52.440> fill<00:05:52.770> cards

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.010 
like this video on shooting white

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.070
