there<00:00:57.390> we<00:00:57.539> go<00:00:58.760> so<00:00:59.760> now<00:01:00.539> we<00:01:01.440> can<00:01:01.590> see<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.930> you

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
there we go so now we can see that you

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.750 
there we go so now we can see that you
know<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.080> can<00:01:04.409> use<00:01:04.589> some<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.309> controls

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
know you can use some of the controls

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.460 
know you can use some of the controls
here<00:01:06.210> like<00:01:07.020> when<00:01:07.320> we<00:01:07.439> go<00:01:07.619> here<00:01:08.130> inside<00:01:09.020> it<00:01:10.020> does

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
here like when we go here inside it does

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.330 
here like when we go here inside it does
notice<00:01:12.409> you<00:01:13.409> can<00:01:13.560> see<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.950> it's<00:01:14.130> moving

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
notice you can see that it's moving

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.429 
notice you can see that it's moving
around<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.939> everything<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.600> counter<00:01:16.200> works

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
around and everything so counter works

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.499 
around and everything so counter works
of<00:01:16.979> course<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.340> doesn't<00:01:17.520> work<00:01:17.670> fully<00:01:18.119> here

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
of course it doesn't work fully here

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.420 
of course it doesn't work fully here
because<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:19.259> doesn't<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.619> full<00:01:19.830> support<00:01:20.220> but

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
because it doesn't that full support but

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:37.270 
because it doesn't that full support but
if<00:01:20.820> we<00:01:21.270> fire<00:01:21.509> up<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.720> game<00:01:21.930> like<00:01:22.409> GTA<00:01:23.040> vice<00:01:23.369> sity

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:45.850 

[Music]

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:54.990 

[Music]

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.500 

so<00:01:56.000> as<00:01:56.330> you<00:01:56.420> can<00:01:56.540> see<00:01:56.600> here<00:02:01.030> the<00:02:02.030> control<00:02:02.360> we're

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
so as you can see here the control we're

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.840 
so as you can see here the control we're
here<00:02:02.780> to<00:02:03.110> move<00:02:03.350> around<00:02:03.560> and<00:02:03.860> everything<00:02:04.250> does

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
here to move around and everything does

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.090 
here to move around and everything does
work<00:02:05.800> and<00:02:07.899> then<00:02:08.899> we<00:02:08.990> can<00:02:09.170> run<00:02:09.290> faster<00:02:09.830> here<00:02:10.010> as

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
work and then we can run faster here as

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.450 
work and then we can run faster here as
well<00:02:10.369> if<00:02:10.550> we<00:02:11.450> hold<00:02:11.720> in<00:02:11.960> the<00:02:12.080> a<00:02:12.110> button<00:02:12.440> and<00:02:13.220> also

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
well if we hold in the a button and also

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:21.160 
well if we hold in the a button and also
we<00:02:13.550> can<00:02:13.700> jump<00:02:13.880> if<00:02:14.150> we<00:02:14.390> click<00:02:14.750> on<00:02:14.900> X<00:02:15.110> so<00:02:20.080> if<00:02:21.080> you

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
we can jump if we click on X so if you

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:34.449 
we can jump if we click on X so if you
want<00:02:21.320> to<00:02:21.380> steal<00:02:21.560> a<00:02:21.590> car<00:02:21.920> we<00:02:22.190> can<00:02:22.370> press<00:02:22.640> Y

with<00:03:17.060> it<00:03:17.180> and<00:03:17.419> see<00:03:17.650> which<00:03:18.650> one<00:03:18.919> it<00:03:19.219> does<00:03:19.459> work

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
with it and see which one it does work

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.339 
with it and see which one it does work
for<00:03:20.000> and<00:03:20.299> which<00:03:20.450> one<00:03:20.659> it<00:03:20.750> doesn't<00:03:20.900> work<00:03:21.139> for

now also in terms of graphics wise it

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.039 
now also in terms of graphics wise it
seems<00:03:24.290> like<00:03:24.760> with<00:03:25.760> the<00:03:25.939> with<00:03:26.359> this<00:03:26.480> quad-core

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:45.229 
on the galaxy s3 and because it seems

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:46.750 
on the galaxy s3 and because it seems
like<00:03:45.379> it<00:03:45.500> has<00:03:45.560> better<00:03:45.799> support<00:03:46.250> for<00:03:46.489> an<00:03:46.549> ally

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
like it has better support for an ally

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.020 
like it has better support for an ally
GPUs<00:03:47.750> and<00:03:48.049> there<00:03:48.560> is<00:03:48.709> an<00:03:48.949> s4<00:03:49.400> that<00:03:49.459> it's<00:03:49.909> going

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
GPUs and there is an s4 that it's going

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.539 
GPUs and there is an s4 that it's going
to<00:03:50.090> come<00:03:50.269> out<00:03:50.449> with<00:03:50.689> a<00:03:50.720> mallet<00:03:51.040> GPU<00:03:52.040> I'm<00:03:52.310> pretty

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
to come out with a mallet GPU I'm pretty

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.509 
to come out with a mallet GPU I'm pretty
sure<00:03:52.699> the<00:03:52.909> GTR<00:03:53.840> 9500<00:03:54.620> it's<00:03:54.739> like<00:03:54.949> well<00:03:55.250> born<00:03:55.459> in

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
sure the GTR 9500 it's like well born in

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.059 
sure the GTR 9500 it's like well born in
India<00:03:55.849> so<00:03:56.419> I'll<00:03:57.109> see<00:03:57.349> if<00:03:57.500> I<00:03:57.560> can<00:03:57.709> pick<00:03:57.829> it<00:03:57.949> up

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:58.069 
India so I'll see if I can pick it up

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:00.909 
India so I'll see if I can pick it up
and<00:03:58.250> you<00:03:58.549> know<00:03:58.669> fully<00:03:59.209> compare<00:03:59.750> it<00:03:59.900> and<00:04:00.169> but

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:00.919 
and you know fully compare it and but

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:02.229 
and you know fully compare it and but
you<00:04:01.040> can't<00:04:01.220> play<00:04:01.370> this<00:04:01.489> game<00:04:01.549> it's<00:04:02.060> pretty

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
you can't play this game it's pretty

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:03.929 
you can't play this game it's pretty
nice<00:04:02.449> scale<00:04:02.810> with<00:04:02.930> the<00:04:02.989> controller

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:03.939 
nice scale with the controller

here with the d-pad as well and also can

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.200 
here with the d-pad as well and also can
you<00:04:21.079> know<00:04:21.199> go<00:04:21.440> into<00:04:21.620> menus<00:04:22.250> here<00:04:22.550> it<00:04:22.909> also

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
you know go into menus here it also

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.350 
you know go into menus here it also
fully<00:04:23.449> works<00:04:23.750> and<00:04:24.639> also<00:04:25.639> we<00:04:25.729> can<00:04:25.849> change<00:04:26.090> of

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
fully works and also we can change of

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:39.550 
fully works and also we can change of
