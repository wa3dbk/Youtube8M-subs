00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 for that ends in 2006 with the idea 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.029
 that we had with two more friends over 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.109
 break with the structure we wanted to be 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.109
 us the deminers 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.450
 we saw the opportunity in the 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.760
 espadrilles because we saw that a lot 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.410
 people specialized in a common leg 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.030
 and nobody has seen the possibility of creating 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.890
 an added value 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.800
 our dream and our vision of 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.410
 first day force grab and take a 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.690
 well argentine product well popular 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:33.070
 give a twist of design and quality and 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.070
 take it to the world as Argentine 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.820
 we put together a business plan as I said 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.640
 well qualitative for that started to 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.890
 be formed from no longer the contact or 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.899
 the sale with the client from outside but 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.750
 already the assembly of a business plan of the 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.250
 strategy this was during 2007 already to 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.989
 late that year for was 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.120
 marketing in Argentina and 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.039
 we already had distribution in chile and 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.039
 Uruguay and obviously South Africa 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.670
 in 2008 following the opening of the 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.940
 factory marked a before and after in 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.420
 Country Life us half what 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.740
 we make the cut 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.659
 All of our suppliers are 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.549
 Argentine therefore all 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.380
 Argentine materials are the process of 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:20.000
 manufacturing has three stages you start 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.040
 with one the two punching machines that we have 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.140
 what he does is cut both the canvas 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.030
 external like the internal flower shop once 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.070
 that the canvas is cut the 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.600
 cuts with labels and elastics to 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.090
 the unemployed workshops that what they do 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.649
 is to bring in the canvas cooked in the other 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.630
 die cut the rubber and the 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.549
 template and you touch them so that a 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.990
 Once the unemployed are received, go through 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.610
 directly all the materials to 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.229
 arms sector in the armed sector 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.330
 What you do is put these fabrics to 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.610
 stops in standards is inserted the 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.740
 template and he invents them once 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.270
 Cement is entered into an oven and 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.069
 what the oven does is reactivate the 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.810
 glue gets them into a press 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:56.209
 what he does is press hard to 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.069
 that so that soldiers and 

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:59.780
 then this heat reaches the sector of 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:01.429
 quality control where what is done 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.810
 is to control the different details that 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:05.360
 may have from some other thread 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.979
 circling ls the labels and arrives 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.140
 finally to the bending sector or 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.480
 packaging where it is done is 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.000
 and assemble the different packs that we have 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.819
 both for better shoulder as you will see is a 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.740
 very handmade process with which it is very 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.480
 important performance and 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.850
 training that each one has because 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.620
 each one has a very important role in 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.720
 each product we start the factory 11 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.910
 operators that we are already 45 employees in 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.400
 total what started as three countries 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.110
 today it is already commercialized in 25 countries here 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.670
 in argentina we also have a local 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.760
 own and three franchises but that 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.100
 it started as a test or a dream every 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.820
 Crazy time the truth is that he had or was 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:47.140
 having more and more more reality more 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.140
 less of sleep and more of reality 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.730
 this in the truth is very important 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.410
 for us just a month ago and 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.960
 half we celebrate the manufacture of the pair 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.330
 number 500,000 is a signal and is a 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.740
 sign of the great growth we were 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.150
 has our years largely this 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.530
 growth was also due to a good 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.360
 planning is going to continue 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:15.590
 holding firm under this concept of 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.590
 that we were a footwear company 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.750
 Hello 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.090
 today
