00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:04.540
 now the whole collector community 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.180
 become in my relation of figures 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.620
 number 119 I'm a third in this 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.010
 occasion in the relation of the figures 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.780
 of the character known as antiveneno 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.700
 good when he and Brooke divest 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.310
 symbiote and start making a life 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.190
 normal him between working to a foundation 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.800
 which is called a party and at the same time 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.440
 that he leads a normal life develop 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.000
 cancer disease 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.000
 this foundation is owned by martín 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.890
 reads anne cession negative who decided 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.960
 help the book heal cancer 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.999
 and in the process accidentally 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.140
 reactivate the remains of the symbol t that 

00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:40.320
 was in the bloodstream 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:44.340
 of adif 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.550
 and this one manifested when eddie brock 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.770
 he found poison when the guest 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.990
 It was Markarián 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.480
 unlike the other Indians who 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.950
 we know in the marvel universe 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.830
 antiviral is completely meaningless 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.050
 that is to say the bruc is full of control 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.530
 of your actions 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.880
 good as powers have super strength 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.580
 superior to that of spider-man and all its 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.010
 senses have been increased in levels 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.640
 Superman has the healing factor 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.560
 accelerated and has healing properties 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.700
 as the production of antibodies that 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.520
 can cure any disease 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.040
 known and eliminate other impurities all 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.780
 toxins of the human body as you will know 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.670
 when one is sick 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.619
 increases the production of blood cells 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.790
 whites that's why the anti watching a 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.920
 it came out in white 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.720
 You can avoid any kind of clothes like that 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.820
 how to create a camouflage that mixes everything 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.060
 what you are around and it returns 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.630
 invisible as it can be good and as 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.030
 the predators do it 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.030
 is that seniority is not highly 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.689
 resistant to physical damage is capable 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.060
 to resist bullet attacks play free 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:56.670
 it is in violating the weaknesses 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.420
 declines and also does not harm them or the 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.950
 fire neither he nor sonic attacks what 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.539
 only one that has proven that it can 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.720
 damaging is a selling for two and two 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:10.230
 osman laboratories that is called the geek 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.900
 is able to survive in its dangerous 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:15.740
 for these periods of time as per 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.700
 example under water 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.680
 is able to survive toxic gases 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.140
 because it can filter the air they 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.480
 your symbol arrives at your guest I put you in 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.700
 the critical capacity is able to obtain 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.580
 Information from other people or others 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.620
 you invest with just touching them and you have a 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.080
 Spidey sense much more effective than the 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.450
 from spider-man 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.120
 As a curious fact, this symbol was 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:44.170
 destroyed when the saga was used 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:46.270
 like the cure with such a good bowser peter 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.000
 let's start the review of the figure 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.920
 you already know this is the generic mold that 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.580
 hasbrouck there were for the figures of 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:57.370
 robust robust medium strong 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.240
 high or large would be like holic but 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:05.170
 good this figure 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:07.490
 measures 15 from the mouth 16 16 19 centimeters 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.530
 see your head as riders in your 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:14.060
 integrated can be done down and 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:16.730
 up your shoulder guide 360 love 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.350
 comes up there the biceps tour 360 is 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.930
 the double point of articulation in the 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.030
 elbows your wrist rotates and you can also 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.190
 do to the sides do not have any 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.670
 articulation in the fingers the torso can 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:31.510
 go down and you can also go up see in the 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.550
 back and back brings this 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.890
 accessory that makes it look more like 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.790
 it's the anti chin with picks for 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.790
 some places do not 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.330
 just to put back an apple of 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.480
 what 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.640
 put it there is already on the part of 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.740
 back the whole figure is white and has 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.920
 it is painted in black 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.990
 the paint is black his mouth is not 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.720
 can move neither verbal nor laugh or have 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.910
 open and close forgiveness rotates 360 to the 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:06.190
 waist can be opened a little bit 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:08.980
 immunology legs at 360 degrees 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:12.010
 has a double point of articulation in the 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.960
 knees your calf can turn and 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.269
 super good down and up and 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:19.030
 towards the sides because it is a good figure 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.370
 achieved and right now you can say that 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.800
 is the figure together with the spiderman that 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:29.470
 is eating pizza is the most common 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:33.610
 find in the walmart is good and 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:35.590
 good as special for this video 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.490
 unnerved by I want to present the figure 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:43.960
 of anti vendo but the version in select 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:48.810
 this figure as they look is much more 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:51.490
 Large scale select this figure measures 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:57.460
 15 15 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:05:00.310
 16 7 18 19 20 21 centimeters of this 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.860
 figure the plastic is quite friendly 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.860
 the truth the image to the comic is much 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:08.770
 more loyal in select this select version 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:12.130
 it is not such a pure white so intense 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:15.190
 as the white of the figure of hasbro and 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.660
 good this figure is you have white is 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.020
 Price as white but is more in tone 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:22.930
 gray in the paint application is 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.970
 more faded and everything that comes here 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.949
 in piquitos because this one is quite hard 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.169
 If you squeeze a little if it reaches 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:32.199
 hurt 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:33.569
 see the articulation of this figure is 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:35.529
 can do sideways 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:38.439
 practically nothing up and towards 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:41.080
 down then be careful because you can not 

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:43.509
 break the chin pins in the 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:47.620
 homology 360 degrees has a point of 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:49.659
 articulation on the elbows the hand rotates and 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.990
 has no other articulation the 

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:55.210
 waist can rotate 360 ​​degrees can be 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.129
 open some leg seismology 360 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:59.620
 degrees a point of articulation in the 

00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:02.379
 knee the foot can be made towards 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.150
 up and down and that's all as 

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:06.249
 well we know in electus figures 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.930
 good to the articulation as it is not what 

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:09.520
 better than there is but the sculpted is a 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:13.509
 I work pretty pretty well done 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:17.020
 see you cupid of the face is very 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:19.360
 very very very, very good and good 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:24.070
 is that is the plus of this figure by 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:27.130
 this figure comes with this base 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:29.790
 that they see this brings and its parts so that 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:32.350
 I can not 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:35.620
 eat less 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:38.100
 are three parts three peaks a mountain 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:40.230
 here the figure 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:43.950
 and well, it makes her look more 

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:48.210
 is displayed with its base you can not see the 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:52.550
 figure then more imposing do not see and you 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:55.910
 I leave to see him a few seconds 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:58.240
 let's put the cntv not 

00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:00.190
 of hasbro here 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:03.370
 and well, the base could also be 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:04.580
 say that it looks good no but 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.800
 good 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.960
 Well, good friends, these are the figures 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.150
 who will teach you today 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.770
 I hope you liked the video and 

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:15.229
 to help them decide to do 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.610
 these figures because as always they 

00:07:15.229 --> 00:07:20.409
