00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:34.229 
trooper and then you're going to get two
identical<00:03:30.340> Republic<00:03:31.340> troopers<00:03:31.700> in<00:03:32.409> the<00:03:33.409> set

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
identical Republic troopers in the set

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.720 
identical Republic troopers in the set
I'm<00:03:35.239> guessing<00:03:35.750> it's<00:03:36.019> probably<00:03:36.609> like<00:03:37.609> that

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
I'm guessing it's probably like that

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.940 
I'm guessing it's probably like that
Jory<00:03:38.060> escape<00:03:38.389> set<00:03:38.689> where<00:03:38.959> you<00:03:39.260> know<00:03:39.409> you<00:03:39.799> get

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
Jory escape set where you know you get

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.199 
Jory escape set where you know you get
for<00:03:40.189> minifigures<00:03:40.489> and<00:03:41.269> it's<00:03:41.989> about<00:03:42.200> 20<00:03:42.530> bucks

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
for minifigures and it's about 20 bucks

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.789 
for minifigures and it's about 20 bucks
I'm<00:03:44.209> sure<00:03:44.389> you<00:03:44.450> can<00:03:44.599> find<00:03:44.629> with<00:03:45.439> a<00:03:45.470> little<00:03:45.680> bit

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
I'm sure you can find with a little bit

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:47.140 
I'm sure you can find with a little bit
of<00:03:45.859> research<00:03:46.159> how<00:03:46.370> much<00:03:46.549> that's<00:03:46.909> going<00:03:47.060> to

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
of research how much that's going to

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.819 
of research how much that's going to
retail<00:03:47.450> for<00:03:47.840> but<00:03:48.049> I'm<00:03:48.200> guessing<00:03:48.409> it's<00:03:48.680> going

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
retail for but I'm guessing it's going

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:50.800

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
to be in the 1999 range something like

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.520 
to be in the 1999 range something like
that<00:03:51.049> and<00:03:52.510> start<00:03:53.510> building<00:03:53.629> your<00:03:53.930> armies<00:03:54.260> I
