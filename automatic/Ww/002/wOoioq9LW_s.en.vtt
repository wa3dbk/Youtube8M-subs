00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:08.269
 Here come the time to see and learn 

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:13.309
 Of Im Lee control a fee cover geoseo 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:15.500
 Inde songs cover the dining table chairs This is a popular, much like I once again 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:21.529
 I took it to teach you . 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:23.390
 First of all, first of all, please insert capo 1 press, 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:28.279
 Look for the code like this 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.630
 Yes , if we keep the code, we'll be comfortable. 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.920
 It's real. 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:36.020
 It will be the f7 code, so we'll just take it easy. 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:43.280
 This subdivision 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:46.520
 And then, with my little finger, I pressed the third flat in line three . 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:51.820
 So when you start at the beginning, 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.820
 Oh, he said, like this. 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.640
 I need to get some sense of lead . 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.640
 It's a star. 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:09.270
 Press your hand to push it anyway and pull it off, then 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.630
 If you try to hit you comfortable playing a little bit difficult to just start-up 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:16.799
 You can cry to Calypso. 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:20.750
 Some have gone so long without hitting expensive 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.750
 Negative defense 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.670
 I get to sleep that fast. 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.670
 4 I do not want to take a rest easy now 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.320
 It does not matter what. 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:49.979
 Playing the sol what'll After that, the power cord 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:53.399
 9 Then the mouse out l 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:58.319
 Next, this founding is followed by the Beef 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:02.899
 In the form of going up and down again 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:06.460
 Oh well uh oh 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.460
 Oh 5 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.509
 er 5 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.790
 e Nay 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.790
 Then, 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:36.010
 Oh, here in the bell, press down like this. 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.970
 On top of that 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.420
 So that I can hear the sound of my head 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.420
 Next 2 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.959
 Well 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:14.250
 Next time, it's a chore. 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:14.250
 Then I will be Tamil p minor seventh code like this here 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:24.430
 Well this time the Palais three bodies and then the third row next to the No. 3 player 3 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.660
 this week 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.260
 U 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:34.780
 Then the word became worse. 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:40.260
 Then take out the fingers behind the a7 and use your Japanese fingers 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.260
 Press control bar 3 once this plan, I just I use this, please 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.730
 U 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:58.400
 Oh, what yireotji ulreo 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.239
 Straight 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:07.040
 This is the first and second pattern. 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:15.140
 Then, on the third look, there's a bit of code used like a bridge 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:17.859
 When you okay code e code form as it goes up with each other to n4 Faure 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.859
 Pushing up. 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:29.530
 Sensation per consonant 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:36.150
 I feel a bit different because I feel a little different in the second week. 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:43.409
 U 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:56.840
 If we go up here to give just talking will become a notgodo 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.840
 And then you go up another 2 platters, 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.070
 U 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.380
 This is now a code coming 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:16.390
 Then I went up again and got a Predator. 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:19.500
 Well a1c is a major seven code 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:19.500
 2 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.030
 222 Monsters 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:31.539
 Breathing 2.3 yet 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.030
 video 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:37.569
 U 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.569
 U 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:39.569
 Ah 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:50.380
 The repeated buntto look me in the middle of the song, only that the code continues jerking Seven sections 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:53.500
 I've got a7 code like this 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:59.229
 Doremi 1 Gogo 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:06:02.860
 We'll be meaningful. Then take these three. 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:07.590
 Well, then push your finger up one more time. 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.590
 This is the Seven Sham Nyacode, and give it something to do 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:17.590
 This is the seventh time I've broken this code once , 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.979
 There are sections to kick in. 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:22.979
 I guess you'll have to fit it in there.
