these findings here you notice there is

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.770 
these findings here you notice there is
a<00:01:03.460> gate<00:01:03.730> right<00:01:03.910> there<00:01:03.970> also<00:01:04.479> that<00:01:04.629> we're

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
a gate right there also that we're

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.719 
a gate right there also that we're
trying<00:01:04.960> to<00:01:05.110> get<00:01:05.229> through<00:01:05.560> as<00:01:05.830> what<00:01:06.580> we're

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
trying to get through as what we're

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.770 
trying to get through as what we're
working<00:01:06.909> on<00:01:07.350> present<00:01:08.350> link<00:01:09.300> these<00:01:10.300> lines<00:01:10.630> are

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
working on present link these lines are

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.600 
working on present link these lines are
going<00:01:10.990> to<00:01:11.050> lead<00:01:11.229> you<00:01:11.380> up<00:01:11.590> and<00:01:11.800> over<00:01:12.220> the<00:01:12.369> wall

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
going to lead you up and over the wall

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
it can be also a chain there I think

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.990 
it can be also a chain there I think
we<00:01:24.580> want<00:01:24.760> to<00:01:24.820> pull<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:26.080> might<00:01:26.500> be<00:01:26.710> the<00:01:26.800> one<00:01:27.000> all
