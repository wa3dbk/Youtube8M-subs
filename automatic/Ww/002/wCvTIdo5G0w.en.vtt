00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.830
 the staff because now in the day I stayed 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.900
 mistrustful moment when the school of 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.660
 harvard government graduate 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.940
 who already knows by all the studies of 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.590
 politics government and society in general 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.810
 which really is a very cool environment 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.730
 and I'll show you now that 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.500
 here I want what goes on in the 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:32.930
 Then everything changes when I 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:36.239
 I bought analysis this time but the bench 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.010
 and that's what I'll notice but it has 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.340
 people there we march soul be a 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.520
 but it turns out to be 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.100
 very interesting way in some 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.410
 events because this is an arena of 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.720
 discussion of lectures where 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.510
 political leaders 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:58.050
 the economic head of state of a 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.000
 president in the case is academic artists 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.430

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.860
 community of anger in general and I 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.630
 really is this an environment 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.640
 always informal have responded 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.370
 victory be ready because the person 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.500
 I could get there and rest but not the 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.270
 want to make this move to turn a 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.430
 common place where people come here 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.660
 every day on something really very 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.210
 so that people can 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.990
 feel at home and if they receive well 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.790
 cozy 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.410
 We are very close to the 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.600

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.940

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.190

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.380

 Norway 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.690

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.720

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:04.320

 number of education in relation to farc 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.670

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.660
 a beautiful work being done 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.070
 in the economic 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.700

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.360

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:38.310
