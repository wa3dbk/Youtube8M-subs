00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:07.910
 hello we continue in the territorial good 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.860
 we follow then here we are going to be the bird 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.280
 they asked me the first thing that there is 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:16.849
 to do is grab a video I will grab 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.390
 one that makes good sense as a course 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:19.390
 vegueta 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:27.939
 list now that you have to add the 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:31.060
 Effects improve quality and so on 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:34.980
 etcetera etcetera me when I want 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:38.160
 improve quality mostly 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.010
 I add effect of the following luigi 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.620
 contrast 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:46.059
 many times it got a little shine 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.059
 more contrast element 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.780
 how do you see the difference 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:54.120
 although he elaborates some details like that 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.690
 like me the other thing that I like is 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.440
 add edges or make it focus 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.840
 the edges 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.940
 focuses address goes like this the configuration 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.629
 mine 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.629
 how will they see 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.200
 to full screen 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.280
 now full screen without effect 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.280
 in the difference 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:25.030
 Well the other one that I like to do is 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.069
 is how it is said to disappear those 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.829
 black lines to know it 

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:32.920
 disappear what you have to do is here 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:37.119
 which says maintain aspect ratio and 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.939
 can not and stretches that to keep it 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:43.030
 in hd with if you can not configure the 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:45.849
 resolution to do it four times and three 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.039
 when they are led they are put out 

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:52.569
 the black edges the other one that I like 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:54.219
 if you draw in the two effects of 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:57.159
 edge not the contrast effect that 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:58.030
 it would be this the best would be the color 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.879
 corrector 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.069
 the secondary that are highlighted from 

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:04.409
 studio to relief of pc this is another 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:06.299
 good idea 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.099
 the other reason to point all the 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.920
 screen is that here pointing to the 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.290
 pantallita be the preview is for 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.700
 do in general all the effects 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:20.129
 many times when he edited something like that 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:25.250
 then the other option to improve the 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:25.250
 quality is lower than 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.140
 then configure through a percentage 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.140
 focus 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.490
 that I think you're going to see this 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.490
 blur not 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.470
 I think it's this 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.830
 if it 's this sharper when good I think 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.830
 use him 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.439
 kernel seizure that is to focus 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.780
 you can use the pan that 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.630
 you can set with a percentage 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.910
 when you think that 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.370
 Focus but I do not like it very much 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.680
 I prefer bad convulsions because it stands out 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.300
 more the edges and not all 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.910
 good the other 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:16.300
 that must be taken into account through 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:19.190
 this is the special effects as they are 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.069
 vital is 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:25.499
 good 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.499
 and start making the effects to see 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:42.560
 mostly I like how it's said 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:45.290
 highlight the effects of music I do not know 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.350
 it draws my attention 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.940
 Many times it suits as I can 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:55.560
 say look for very good scenes 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.560
 like this vegueta 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:05.140
 for example this detail 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.140
 what can we do with the vegueta here 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:15.610
 we cut it with the sy and we put this 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:18.180
 small square that serves as a cutout 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.180
 for 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:24.840
 to be a type of mask we put it 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.840
 in full screen 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.680
 and cut it with your mac 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.980
 clarity 

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:37.670
 remember well 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:40.100
 all quiet slowly with maximum 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:43.510
 patience me because I'm filming and 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.510
 every second is valuable 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:51.190
 we cut it out like that pip pip 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.190
 I sent you look for anybody 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.960
 well this is another detail this I have 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.510
 activated then 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.600
 all 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:04.500
 what sends here moves the clock 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:07.180
 if I am active this time everything 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.589
 that move will not be like that 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.029
 I have to close and open it back 

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:12.860
 but important for reale the first 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:15.020
 keyframe 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.530
 I'll put this on as first there is 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:23.659
 so that it is more orderly after 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:25.770
 another copy will be destroyed I will put a new one 

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:28.169
 video track 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.520
 I'll put it down here because everything 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:33.340
 the effects are up 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:37.960
 you notice more the video with the effect is 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:40.849
 down or down here 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:44.479
 they are going to show it 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:48.580
 and it 's so black but I'm going to 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:48.580
 to do is to erase everything was ready 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.560
 a clear and 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.699
 I was not supposed to have the process 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:08.820
 Frame it clear there is still here 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.590
 to delete the list and you have to move 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.800
 still here but the same but for 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.800
 The doubts 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:17.070
 there he is and what he has here 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:23.470
 what can we add a convoluted effect 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:28.050
 like this one 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:28.050
 like the tuner tv 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.480
 A.M 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:37.710
 we live with esteban put a scene 

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:40.200
 to do it until the effect 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:41.760
 mostly here there are three drums or 

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.820
 four 

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:47.820
 as you will notice I only use mostly 

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:51.000
 to use the flash many times people 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:54.630
 they do not accept the flash even though the flash is 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:58.380
 one of the most things as I can tell you 

00:06:54.630 --> 00:07:00.460
 basic to make a baby many times 

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:04.710
 help as a newbie 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.710
 but not everything has to be the flash
