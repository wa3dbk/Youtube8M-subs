00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.660 
I like this compared to the link bands
because<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:09.810> find<00:02:10.229> with<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.560> link<00:02:10.830> bands

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
linked bands they just catch all the

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.410

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670

grody<00:02:38.100> all<00:02:38.760> you<00:02:38.940> do<00:02:39.120> is<00:02:39.269> you<00:02:39.330> have<00:02:39.480> these

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
grody all you do is you have these

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:40.910 
grody all you do is you have these
little<00:02:39.780> buttons<00:02:40.080> right<00:02:40.440> here<00:02:40.680> you're<00:02:40.800> gonna

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
little buttons right here you're gonna

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.350 
little buttons right here you're gonna
push<00:02:41.280> that<00:02:41.489> in<00:02:41.930> and<00:02:43.160> I<00:02:44.160> really<00:02:45.000> don't<00:02:45.060> have<00:02:45.180> any

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
push that in and I really don't have any

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.940 
push that in and I really don't have any
nails<00:02:45.600> so<00:02:45.840> it's<00:02:45.930> a<00:02:46.019> little<00:02:46.290> bit<00:02:46.440> difficult<00:02:46.680> for

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
nails so it's a little bit difficult for

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.590 
nails so it's a little bit difficult for
me<00:02:47.160> and<00:02:47.400> then<00:02:47.519> just<00:02:47.700> slide<00:02:48.030> it<00:02:48.239> out<00:02:48.330> right

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
me and then just slide it out right

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.170 
me and then just slide it out right
there<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.680> we're<00:02:49.920> gonna<00:02:49.980> push<00:02:50.400> on<00:02:50.580> this<00:02:50.940> side

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
there and we're gonna push on this side

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.680 
there and we're gonna push on this side
and<00:02:52.100> slide<00:02:53.100> it<00:02:53.340> out<00:02:53.430> like<00:02:53.730> that<00:02:53.760> so<00:02:54.150> there<00:02:54.540> we

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
and slide it out like that so there we

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.770 
and slide it out like that so there we
go<00:02:54.840> there<00:02:55.290> is<00:02:55.319> the<00:02:55.980> Apple<00:02:56.730> watch<00:02:56.880> without<00:02:57.209> any

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
this correct I believe this should go

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.250 
this correct I believe this should go
along<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.489> bottom<00:03:05.700> here<00:03:05.930> we'll<00:03:06.930> slide<00:03:07.230> that

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
along the bottom here we'll slide that

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.949 
along the bottom here we'll slide that
in<00:03:07.739> clicked<00:03:08.549> in<00:03:08.819> and<00:03:09.769> we'll<00:03:10.769> go<00:03:10.950> over<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.959> of

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
took some fiddling to get in that was

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.340 
took some fiddling to get in that was
not<00:03:41.760> as<00:03:41.970> easy<00:03:42.090> as<00:03:42.269> I<00:03:42.480> was<00:03:42.720> hoping<00:03:43.170> it's

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
not as easy as I was hoping it's

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.960 
not as easy as I was hoping it's
definitely<00:03:43.739> not<00:03:43.859> as<00:03:44.010> easy<00:03:44.190> as<00:03:44.340> putting<00:03:44.640> these

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970
