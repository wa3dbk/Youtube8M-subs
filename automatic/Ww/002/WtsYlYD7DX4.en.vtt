00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.619 

now<00:00:36.000> let's<00:00:36.420> see<00:00:36.690> here<00:00:40.730> sometimes<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:42.149> could<00:00:42.570> be

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
now let's see here sometimes it could be

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.310 
now let's see here sometimes it could be
a<00:00:42.809> little<00:00:43.140> bit<00:00:43.260> glitchy<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:44.750> just<00:00:45.750> be<00:00:46.020> aware<00:00:46.050> of

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
a little bit glitchy so just be aware of

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:57.560 
a little bit glitchy so just be aware of
that

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.890 

mmm<00:00:58.320> my<00:00:58.440> console<00:00:59.340> console<00:00:59.760> okay<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:00.660> it's

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
mmm my console console okay so it's

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.579 
mmm my console console okay so it's
connecting<00:01:01.320> now<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:02.660> had<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.690> crash<00:01:04.110> once

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
connecting now I had a crash once

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.010

actually

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.210 
actually
so<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.260> could<00:01:07.380> happen<00:01:07.470> it'll<00:01:07.680> be<00:01:07.830> good<00:01:08.010> there

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
so that could happen it'll be good there

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.580 
so that could happen it'll be good there

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
I will also leave a link institution to

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.449 
I will also leave a link institution to
a<00:02:55.560> lightning<00:02:56.190> like<00:02:57.000> an<00:02:57.180> AV<00:02:57.870> adapter<00:02:58.830> so<00:02:59.400> you

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
a lightning like an AV adapter so you

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.370 
a lightning like an AV adapter so you
can<00:02:59.580> connect<00:03:00.000> your<00:03:00.120> maybe<00:03:00.870> if<00:03:01.019> you<00:03:01.140> have<00:03:01.290> an

be<00:03:19.290> pretty<00:03:19.470> epic<00:03:19.650> probably<00:03:20.130> it's<00:03:20.580> pretty

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
be pretty epic probably it's pretty

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.490 
be pretty epic probably it's pretty
expensive<00:03:20.940> cable<00:03:21.360> but<00:03:21.750> still<00:03:21.959> only<00:03:22.080> the<00:03:22.290> night

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
expensive cable but still only the night

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.729

condition<00:03:22.950> to<00:03:23.040> it<00:03:23.840> one<00:03:24.840> of<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.019> and<00:03:25.350> I

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
condition to it one of the and I

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.509 
condition to it one of the and I
definitely<00:03:26.100> probably<00:03:26.670> would<00:03:26.940> buy<00:03:27.120> it<00:03:27.180> myself

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
definitely probably would buy it myself

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.520 
definitely probably would buy it myself
because<00:03:29.519> it<00:03:29.910> looks<00:03:30.090> that<00:03:30.540> looks<00:03:30.870> like<00:03:31.380> it

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
because it looks that looks like it

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.340 
because it looks that looks like it
could<00:03:31.769> be<00:03:31.799> pretty<00:03:32.100> epic<00:03:32.250> to<00:03:32.519> make<00:03:32.670> a<00:03:32.700> video<00:03:33.000> box

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
could be pretty epic to make a video box

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.220 
could be pretty epic to make a video box
it's<00:03:34.350> got<00:03:34.530> a<00:03:34.590> pretty<00:03:34.920> okay<00:03:35.070> TV<00:03:35.790> so<00:03:36.150> would<00:03:37.079> be

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
it's got a pretty okay TV so would be

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.190 
it's got a pretty okay TV so would be
cool<00:03:37.470> to<00:03:37.739> see<00:03:37.769> I<00:03:38.250> mean<00:03:39.120> II<00:03:39.150> would<00:03:39.450> use<00:03:39.660> be<00:03:39.959> like

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
cool to see I mean II would use be like

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.130 
cool to see I mean II would use be like
an<00:03:40.380> Xbox<00:03:40.860> or<00:03:41.160> something<00:03:41.579> or<00:03:42.120> PlayStation<00:03:42.900> but

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
an Xbox or something or PlayStation but

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.770 
an Xbox or something or PlayStation but
they<00:03:43.290> could<00:03:43.500> play<00:03:43.680> this<00:03:43.829> game<00:03:44.239> but<00:03:45.239> it<00:03:45.630> would

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
they could play this game but it would

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.270 
they could play this game but it would
feel<00:03:46.019> like<00:03:46.079> it<00:03:46.500> is<00:03:46.620> full<00:03:47.160> like<00:03:48.030> gaming<00:03:48.329> console

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
feel like it is full like gaming console

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.250 
feel like it is full like gaming console
probably<00:03:50.280> I<00:03:50.690> will<00:03:51.690> no<00:03:51.900> have<00:03:51.930> a<00:03:52.200> product

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
probably I will no have a product

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:21.219 
probably I will no have a product
that's<00:03:54.680> my<00:03:54.860> guess<00:04:12.610> I<00:04:19.600> also<00:04:20.600> tried<00:04:20.900> out<00:04:20.930> those

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
that's my guess I also tried out those

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.590 
that's my guess I also tried out those
other<00:04:21.530> GTA<00:04:22.070> games<00:04:22.310> like<00:04:22.520> GTA<00:04:22.580> Vice<00:04:23.090> City<00:04:23.120> and

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600
