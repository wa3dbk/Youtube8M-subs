00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
favorite parts is the first time the

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.650 
favorite parts is the first time the
freshmen<00:02:07.439> hear<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.710> cannon<00:02:08.069> ever<00:02:08.660> it's

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
freshmen hear the cannon ever it's

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.760 
freshmen hear the cannon ever it's
always<00:02:09.899> good<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.080> see<00:02:10.289> them<00:02:10.440> jump<00:02:10.619> out<00:02:10.709> of

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
always good to see them jump out of

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.800 
always good to see them jump out of
their<00:02:10.920> skin

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
their skin

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.449

I<00:02:15.319> remember<00:02:16.319> being<00:02:16.500> a<00:02:16.590> freshman<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.099> jumping

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
I remember being a freshman and jumping

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.100 
I remember being a freshman and jumping
so<00:02:17.760> that<00:02:18.090> was<00:02:18.180> pretty<00:02:18.360> startling<00:02:18.630> but<00:02:18.959> I'd

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
so that was pretty startling but I'd

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.960 
so that was pretty startling but I'd
have<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.380> say<00:02:19.530> my<00:02:19.560> absolute<00:02:20.459> favorite<00:02:20.730> part<00:02:20.849> of

being<00:02:21.360> on<00:02:21.450> skipper<00:02:21.720> crew<00:02:21.870> is<00:02:21.989> pulling<00:02:22.200> the

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410
