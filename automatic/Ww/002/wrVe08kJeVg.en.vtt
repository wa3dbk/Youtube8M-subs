00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.920 
and so if I'll be able to complain about
the<00:00:19.170> sensitivity<00:00:19.680> being<00:00:20.250> one<00:00:20.460> this<00:00:21.449> is<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.689> way

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
the sensitivity being one this is a way

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.670 
the sensitivity being one this is a way
to<00:00:21.990> get<00:00:22.289> off<00:00:23.039> one<00:00:23.820> two<00:00:24.300> three<00:00:24.869> four<00:00:25.289> plays

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
to get off one two three four plays

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.519 
to get off one two three four plays
nobody<00:00:26.340> however<00:00:26.880> my<00:00:27.000> needed<00:00:27.390> does<00:00:28.019> obsessive
