00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
I had to they're a little on the steep

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.400 
I had to they're a little on the steep
side<00:03:49.850> considering<00:03:50.630> that<00:03:50.720> I'm<00:03:50.870> a<00:03:50.900> college<00:03:51.260> trip

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
side considering that I'm a college trip

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.220 
side considering that I'm a college trip
but<00:03:51.800> it's<00:03:52.430> hard<00:03:52.940> to<00:03:53.030> come<00:03:53.300> by<00:03:53.480> a<00:03:53.510> very<00:03:53.990> good

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
but it's hard to come by a very good

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.870 
but it's hard to come by a very good
shampoo<00:03:54.680> that<00:03:55.190> leaves<00:03:55.430> your<00:03:55.580> hair<00:03:55.700> really
