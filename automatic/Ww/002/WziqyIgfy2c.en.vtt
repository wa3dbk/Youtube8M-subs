gamers out there and I do see a lot of
PC<00:00:57.280> gamers<00:00:57.760> that<00:00:57.969> do<00:00:58.660> want<00:00:59.050> final<00:00:59.590> fantasy<00:01:00.040> on

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
PC gamers that do want final fantasy on

their pc not MMO final fancies but more

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.840

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
final fantasies and I think they should

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:10.529 
final fantasies and I think they should
do<00:01:09.160> this<00:01:09.340> because<00:01:09.580> they're<00:01:09.910> using<00:01:10.270> high-tech

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:10.539 
do this because they're using high-tech

technology from pc into their ps4 and
xbox<00:01:15.490> one<00:01:15.610> so<00:01:16.390> if<00:01:16.720> they<00:01:16.840> can<00:01:17.020> run<00:01:17.170> on<00:01:17.350> the<00:01:17.500> ps4

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
xbox one so if they can run on the ps4

for graphics ram cpu hard drive you can

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.530 
for graphics ram cpu hard drive you can
get<00:02:19.569> all<00:02:19.780> of<00:02:19.810> this<00:02:20.200> and<00:02:20.530> I<00:02:21.220> think<00:02:21.280> pc<00:02:22.090> should

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
get all of this and I think pc should

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.380 
get all of this and I think pc should
have<00:02:22.810> found<00:02:23.709> fancy<00:02:24.219> main<00:02:24.430> titles<00:02:24.969> on<00:02:25.150> it

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
have found fancy main titles on it

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.100 
have found fancy main titles on it
because<00:02:25.810> they<00:02:26.560> can<00:02:26.769> still<00:02:27.129> do<00:02:27.849> what<00:02:28.209> is<00:02:28.390> best

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
because they can still do what is best

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.240 
because they can still do what is best
than<00:02:29.290> a<00:02:29.710> ps4<00:02:30.100> and<00:02:30.610> xbox<00:02:31.210> one<00:02:31.330> it's<00:02:32.200> it's<00:02:32.680> basic

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
than a ps4 and xbox one it's it's basic
