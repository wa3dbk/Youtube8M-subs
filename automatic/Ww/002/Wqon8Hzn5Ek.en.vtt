00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello and welcome to animal list with 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:08.730
 alexandra youtuber below the 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.790
 next topic bulldog argentino versus 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.980
 bull and cut a Argentine bulldog versus 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.890
 public would you know what would happen if you 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.539
 will face these dog breeds 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.189
 surely not since so far 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.619
 there has been no confrontation data 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.269
 between these two dogs being the first 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.119
 a little more muscular than the second 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.220
 but at the same time smaller 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.080
 if you are knowledgeable about the subject 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.090
 previously you will already know who the base of the 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.610
 winner or at least the one who fights the most 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.739
 would give on the battlefield if not what 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.390
 you know next we show you the 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.230
 strengths and weaknesses of each 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.750
 race the Argentine bulldog as its name what 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.640
 says comes from Argentina and it is said that 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.350
 is one of the strongest dogs in all 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.960
 because the country has a rugged look 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.539
 with big muscles has a bite 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.670
 very strong and is capable of not letting go 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.500
 who bites for long minutes because their 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.840
 lips are adjusted to breathe at 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.870
 same time that bites what distinguishes 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.790
 to this race is that you have a lot of courage 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.340
 resistance and strength 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.980
 on the other hand the public is coming 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.960
 from pakistan and unlike the east dogo 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.090
 It is not so strong but if a little more 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.790
 high what makes it faster at the time 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.770
 of facing other dogs the bad of 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.140
 this race is that it does not have a bite 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.910
 so strong so the damage that each 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.560
 Once it bites, it's little, so 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.840
 it would need a lot of effort to 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.060
 knock down a muscular dog without 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.250
 But with its speed it could have 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.120
 advantage over a sturdy dog â€‹â€‹since 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.120
 I could predict certain bites like 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.700
 dodging 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:43.580
 then Argentine bulldog versus public 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.280
 is who would win who would come out 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.140
 winner in front of his rival in many 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.510
 dogfighting what matters most are 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.860
 the muscles because that would give you many 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.320
 points to endurance and bites 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.750
 but sometimes the winner comes out 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.300
 bite easier on the neck since it is 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.770
 the weak point of each dog the bulldog 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.380
 Argentinean could not bite so 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.470
 easily the public's neck so 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.630
 that would struggle much more to win 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.000
 given the characteristics the winner is 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.730
 the bully kuta for being more easily 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.130
 bite the weak point of your rival are you 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.210
