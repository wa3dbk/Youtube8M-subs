00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.540 

I<00:00:54.660> use<00:00:55.660> a<00:00:55.690> set<00:00:56.080> of<00:00:56.200> torches<00:00:56.650> manufactured<00:00:57.400> by

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
I use a set of torches manufactured by

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.180 
I use a set of torches manufactured by
Bethlehem<00:00:58.090> apparatus<00:00:58.980> both<00:00:59.980> are

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190

half of the art of glass working and

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.930 
half of the art of glass working and
borosilicate<00:01:14.020> is<00:01:14.470> really<00:01:14.800> a<00:01:14.830> big<00:01:15.310> game<00:01:15.670> of

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
borosilicate is really a big game of

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.300 
borosilicate is really a big game of
muscle<00:01:16.540> memory<00:01:16.930> it's<00:01:17.350> all<00:01:17.530> a<00:01:17.560> question<00:01:17.890> of

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
muscle memory it's all a question of

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.580 
muscle memory it's all a question of
making<00:01:18.550> sure<00:01:18.790> you<00:01:19.180> discipline<00:01:19.870> your<00:01:20.050> hands

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
making sure you discipline your hands

in complete synchronization applying

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.999 
in complete synchronization applying
lines<00:01:29.320> is<00:01:29.979> an<00:01:30.250> absolutely<00:01:30.790> crucial<00:01:31.590> skill<00:01:32.590> and

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
lines is an absolutely crucial skill and

Baltic glass and flameworking it's the

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.109 
Baltic glass and flameworking it's the
basic<00:01:37.420> foundation<00:01:38.220> for<00:01:39.220> a<00:01:39.250> lot<00:01:39.610> of<00:01:39.850> very

basic foundation for a lot of very

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:52.650 
basic foundation for a lot of very
fundamental<00:01:40.960> color<00:01:41.170> work<00:01:51.000> it's<00:01:52.000> easy<00:01:52.240> to<00:01:52.479> get

fundamental color work it's easy to get

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.350 
fundamental color work it's easy to get
confused<00:01:52.840> and<00:01:53.530> not<00:01:53.649> understand<00:01:54.340> that<00:01:54.610> a<00:01:54.729> piece

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
confused and not understand that a piece

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.440 
confused and not understand that a piece
of<00:01:55.390> art<00:01:55.869> such<00:01:56.350> as<00:01:56.560> this<00:01:56.790> can<00:01:57.790> take<00:01:57.970> hours<00:01:58.420> to

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
of art such as this can take hours to

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.870 
of art such as this can take hours to
actually<00:01:59.110> manufacture<00:01:59.470> and<00:02:00.220> the<00:02:00.310> video<00:02:00.490> can

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
actually manufacture and the video can

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.880 
actually manufacture and the video can
really<00:02:01.149> condense<00:02:01.690> it<00:02:01.899> down<00:02:01.929> and<00:02:02.440> show<00:02:02.619> it<00:02:02.770> is

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
really condense it down and show it is

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.590 
really condense it down and show it is
something<00:02:03.130> that<00:02:03.310> happens<00:02:03.880> in<00:02:04.000> a<00:02:04.119> period<00:02:04.450> of

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
something that happens in a period of

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.300 
something that happens in a period of
just<00:02:04.840> minutes<00:02:05.410> and<00:02:06.600> really<00:02:07.600> it's<00:02:08.020> there's<00:02:08.770> so

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
just minutes and really it's there's so

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.120 
just minutes and really it's there's so
much<00:02:09.580> to<00:02:09.910> it

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.540 

I<00:02:12.510> love<00:02:13.510> watching<00:02:14.200> glass<00:02:14.740> flare<00:02:15.160> out<00:02:15.190> no

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
I love watching glass flare out no

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.430 
I love watching glass flare out no
matter<00:02:15.670> how<00:02:15.940> many<00:02:16.090> times<00:02:16.390> I<00:02:16.600> do<00:02:16.660> it<00:02:16.870> flaring

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
matter how many times I do it flaring

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.920 
matter how many times I do it flaring
out<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.710> top<00:02:17.950> of<00:02:18.130> a<00:02:18.220> cup<00:02:18.460> or<00:02:18.700> a<00:02:18.760> goblet<00:02:19.390> or<00:02:19.780> the

out the top of a cup or a goblet or the

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.080 
out the top of a cup or a goblet or the
base<00:02:20.200> it's<00:02:21.070> probably<00:02:21.250> always<00:02:21.790> one<00:02:21.940> of<00:02:22.030> the

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
base it's probably always one of the

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:33.850 
base it's probably always one of the
most<00:02:22.300> rewarding<00:02:22.510> moments
