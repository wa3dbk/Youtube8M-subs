00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
for Morrison he was he's a lefty and and

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.689 
for Morrison he was he's a lefty and and
I<00:00:57.950> have<00:00:58.129> to<00:00:58.250> face<00:00:58.460> her<00:00:58.640> right<00:00:58.820> hand<00:01:00.489> they<00:01:01.489> go

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:12.609 
I have to face her right hand they go
down<00:01:01.970> and<00:01:02.210> probably<00:01:02.750> out<00:01:03.699> what<00:01:04.699> a<00:01:04.729> huge<00:01:05.089> shot

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.520 

that's<00:01:13.070> it<00:01:13.549> well<00:01:14.210> the<00:01:14.539> morosely<00:01:14.899> left<00:01:15.259> Chuck

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
that's it well the morosely left Chuck

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.459 
that's it well the morosely left Chuck
which<00:01:15.770> is<00:01:15.920> a<00:01:15.950> good<00:01:16.250> one<00:01:16.630> first<00:01:17.630> punch<00:01:17.960> he<00:01:18.140> threw
