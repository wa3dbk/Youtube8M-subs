00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
so here we have a ex car link kit I've

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.169 
so here we have a ex car link kit I've
been<00:00:06.210> working<00:00:06.509> on<00:00:06.600> installing<00:00:06.779> it<00:00:07.350> and<00:00:08.179> I've

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
been working on installing it and I've

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.150 
been working on installing it and I've
got<00:00:09.450> it<00:00:09.599> pretty<00:00:09.870> much<00:00:10.080> routed<00:00:10.559> at<00:00:10.650> this<00:00:10.830> point

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
got it pretty much routed at this point

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.220 
got it pretty much routed at this point
and<00:00:11.370> this<00:00:11.820> is<00:00:12.000> also<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.300> ex<00:00:12.540> car<00:00:12.750> kit<00:00:12.960> with<00:00:13.110> the

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
and this is also the ex car kit with the

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.740 
and this is also the ex car kit with the
Bluetooth<00:00:13.440> option<00:00:13.969> so<00:00:14.969> there's<00:00:15.450> the

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
Bluetooth option so there's the

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.800 
Bluetooth option so there's the
bluetooth<00:00:16.170> receiver<00:00:16.670> and<00:00:17.670> there's<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.359> ipod

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
bluetooth receiver and there's the ipod

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.250 
bluetooth receiver and there's the ipod
ipod<00:00:19.470> cable<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:20.010> comes<00:00:20.160> with<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.520> kit<00:00:21.260> in

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
ipod cable that comes with the kit in

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.670 
ipod cable that comes with the kit in
this<00:00:22.560> particular<00:00:22.740> case<00:00:23.930> the<00:00:24.930> bluetooth

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
this particular case the bluetooth

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.429 
this particular case the bluetooth
receiver<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.820> has<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.390> mic<00:00:27.720> that<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.170> have<00:00:28.289> to

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
receiver the has a mic that you have to

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.500 
receiver the has a mic that you have to
route<00:00:28.710> somehow<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:30.000> kind<00:00:30.210> of<00:00:30.240> see<00:00:30.359> that

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
route somehow and you kind of see that

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.479 
route somehow and you kind of see that
little<00:00:30.660> wire<00:00:30.900> there<00:00:31.199> that's<00:00:31.410> kind<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:32.279> right

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
little wire there that's kind of right

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.700 
little wire there that's kind of right
here<00:00:32.759> at<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.059> very<00:00:33.270> back<00:00:33.450> part<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:33.989> let's

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
here at the very back part of it let's

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.280 
here at the very back part of it let's
just<00:00:34.800> loop<00:00:35.190> back<00:00:35.460> underneath<00:00:35.790> i<00:00:36.149> looped<00:00:36.930> the

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
just loop back underneath i looped the

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.160 
just loop back underneath i looped the
cable<00:00:37.820> for<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.850> bluetooth<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.510> all<00:00:39.690> tucked<00:00:40.050> in

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
cable for the bluetooth is all tucked in

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.290 
cable for the bluetooth is all tucked in
here<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:41.190> they're<00:00:41.340> all<00:00:41.520> nice<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:41.969> bundled

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
here so they're all nice and bundled

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.000 
here so they're all nice and bundled
together<00:00:42.420> along<00:00:43.110> with<00:00:43.140> all<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.649> ipod

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
together along with all the ipod

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.290 
together along with all the ipod
connections<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.579> things<00:00:44.730> like<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:44.879> coming

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
connections and things like that coming

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.389 
connections and things like that coming
off<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.570> ex<00:00:45.690> car<00:00:45.870> link<00:00:46.079> i<00:00:46.230> have<00:00:46.649> not<00:00:46.860> yet<00:00:47.160> used

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
off the ex car link i have not yet used

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.700 
off the ex car link i have not yet used
the<00:00:47.640> auxiliary<00:00:48.090> option<00:00:48.539> but<00:00:49.200> i<00:00:49.230> will<00:00:49.469> probably

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
the auxiliary option but i will probably

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.709 
the auxiliary option but i will probably
later<00:00:50.039> when<00:00:50.550> i<00:00:50.610> get<00:00:50.789> enough<00:00:51.000> cable<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.390> do<00:00:51.539> that

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
later when i get enough cable to do that

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.189 
later when i get enough cable to do that
i'll<00:00:52.289> come<00:00:52.469> back<00:00:52.559> in<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.190> put<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.730> in<00:00:53.879> but<00:00:54.690> in

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
i'll come back in and put that in but in

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.220 
i'll come back in and put that in but in
the<00:00:55.320> meantime<00:00:55.850> to<00:00:56.850> route<00:00:57.210> these<00:00:57.390> cables<00:00:57.960> is

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
the meantime to route these cables is

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:05.359 
the meantime to route these cables is
pretty<00:00:58.710> simple<00:01:03.409> there's<00:01:04.409> openings<00:01:04.979> here<00:01:05.100> in

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
pretty simple there's openings here in

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.590 
pretty simple there's openings here in
the<00:01:05.460> bottom<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:05.939> can<00:01:06.060> just<00:01:06.180> kind<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.390> cut

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
the bottom and you can just kind of cut

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.090 
the bottom and you can just kind of cut
some<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.020> little<00:01:07.200> grill<00:01:07.470> out<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:07.979> can

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
some of the little grill out so you can

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.590 
some of the little grill out so you can
route<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.400> cables<00:01:08.880> through<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.270> you'll<00:01:09.390> see

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
route the cables through and you'll see

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.230 
route the cables through and you'll see
that<00:01:09.630> these<00:01:10.439> cables<00:01:10.830> are<00:01:10.920> routed<00:01:11.159> through<00:01:11.340> the

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
that these cables are routed through the

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.380 
that these cables are routed through the
michaels<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.900> as<00:01:13.049> i<00:01:13.170> said<00:01:13.380> before<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:14.390> routed

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
michaels it as i said before is routed

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.960 
michaels it as i said before is routed
back<00:01:15.570> underneath<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.920> tracks<00:01:17.250> with<00:01:17.640> the

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
back underneath and it tracks with the

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.640 
back underneath and it tracks with the
cable<00:01:18.630> connection<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.140> goes<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.470> back

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
cable connection that goes to the back

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.070 
cable connection that goes to the back
side<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.040> head<00:01:20.159> unit<00:01:20.390> so<00:01:21.390> you'll<00:01:21.600> see<00:01:21.900> it

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
side of the head unit so you'll see it

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.880 
side of the head unit so you'll see it
comes<00:01:22.350> all<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.619> way<00:01:22.799> in<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.400> goes<00:01:24.000> up<00:01:24.210> through

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
comes all the way in and goes up through

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.950 
comes all the way in and goes up through
the<00:01:25.890> side<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.189> this<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.330> side<00:01:27.630> right

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
the side of this to the side right

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.140 
the side of this to the side right
through<00:01:28.170> here<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:29.100> mic<00:01:29.280> i<00:01:29.430> have<00:01:29.610> exiting

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
through here and the mic i have exiting

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.690 
through here and the mic i have exiting
right<00:01:30.420> here<00:01:30.720> at<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.990> vent<00:01:31.250> that<00:01:32.250> seems<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.670> be

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
right here at the vent that seems to be

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.160 
right here at the vent that seems to be
the<00:01:32.790> best<00:01:33.030> place<00:01:33.210> i<00:01:33.360> can<00:01:33.509> find<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.840> put<00:01:34.049> it

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
the best place i can find to put it

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.539 
the best place i can find to put it
because<00:01:34.320> there's<00:01:34.470> no<00:01:34.680> way<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.920> like<00:01:35.250> there's

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
because there's no way to like there's

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.910 
because there's no way to like there's
the<00:01:35.670> cables<00:01:36.000> not<00:01:36.119> long<00:01:36.329> enough<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:37.380> run<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.740> up

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
the cables not long enough to run it up

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.890 
the cables not long enough to run it up
to<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.400> sill<00:01:38.670> like<00:01:39.119> i<00:01:39.240> was<00:01:39.329> going<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.509> say<00:01:39.570> put

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
to the sill like i was going to say put

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.929 
to the sill like i was going to say put
it<00:01:39.990> up<00:01:40.079> here<00:01:40.200> on<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.409> a-pillar<00:01:40.799> but<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.700> can't

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
it up here on the a-pillar but you can't

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.520 
it up here on the a-pillar but you can't
do<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.299> because<00:01:42.360> it's<00:01:42.630> not<00:01:42.780> long<00:01:42.990> enough<00:01:43.229> so

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
do that because it's not long enough so

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.289 
do that because it's not long enough so
the<00:01:43.740> next<00:01:43.860> best<00:01:43.979> thing<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.490> i<00:01:44.549> try<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:44.880> fit<00:01:45.180> it

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
the next best thing is i try and fit it

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.490 
the next best thing is i try and fit it
somewhere<00:01:45.600> else<00:01:45.720> or<00:01:45.960> stick<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.380> onto

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
somewhere else or stick it onto
