00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:10.920
 Today I will show you how to do this 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:12.900
 here's a seed conversion all enough 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:18.289
 just and the feelings you need is just 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:23.090
 It was on a4 format it is our scissors 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:27.300
 first you need to make an ordinary square 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:33.270
 note paper is still so beautiful here and 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:35.360
 make noise morons first on her patterns 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.840
 which did not like 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:44.250
 things didn't paint it all with the help 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:47.100
 instant coffee and black tea 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:52.320
 here the moment is still very important that water 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:55.949
 it's better to use literally just 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.820
 boiled and because cold water is 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.360
 everything will last longer and not so 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.730
 intense color 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.280
 Viburnum has a lot of beautiful leaves 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:10.300
 with different patterns of the pattern Karina finds 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.000
 online and prints them on a printer 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.400
 but there is also such a moment from coffee 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.110
 the paper is a little colder and 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:23.160
 sow and match i'll take do 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:28.080
 the gift can be folded into 3 equal parts 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:32.430
 hands just creating and so here's the wave 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.430
 sees just mark on the line 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.240
 and note all the caches take this one 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.990
 needle to leave no traces of 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:54.950
 a pencil 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:58.789
 not about an important feature smooth lines 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:06.289
 to sharpeners squeal further take the second 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:09.069
 side and bring to this fold conveniently 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:13.239
 we have three parts 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:17.290
 let's do the same with the restaurant 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.290
 we also divide it into three parts 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.640
 so when our sheet is divided into even 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:40.290
 the squares we begin to fold our 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:46.780
 the envelope must first be folded 1 and 2 row 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:47.230
 this corner piece is bent in half 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.360
 him 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:54.150
 and here we smooth diagonally 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.780
 so we do with our 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.780
 communicate with names 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:19.069
 and now we have one side left 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.550
 which we cannot put like these 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.640
 three 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:25.550
 we just take and pull this one 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:40.400
 I take the little corner on myself 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:44.840
 part here is our bread just ready it 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:48.049
 straighten now you can perform 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:52.130
 its your favorite seeds of her beads 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:54.610
 this year it is easy enough to fold 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:58.150
 you just need to fold one by one 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.150
 every part 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.630
 our envelope cut off
