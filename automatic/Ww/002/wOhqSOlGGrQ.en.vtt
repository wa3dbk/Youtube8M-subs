00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
swords dance predicting the King shield

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.010 
swords dance predicting the King shield
which<00:00:58.140> he<00:00:58.680> does<00:00:58.829> not<00:00:58.859> use<00:00:59.270> but<00:01:00.270> he<00:01:00.420> goes<00:01:00.629> for<00:01:00.840> a

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
which he does not use but he goes for a

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.270 
which he does not use but he goes for a
Swords<00:01:01.410> Dance<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.739> his<00:01:01.859> own<00:01:03.979> and<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.189> figured

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
Swords Dance of his own and so I figured

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.580 
Swords Dance of his own and so I figured
he'd<00:01:05.729> go<00:01:05.909> for<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.240> King<00:01:06.390> shield<00:01:06.689> next<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.409> this

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
he'd go for the King shield next so this

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.560 
he'd go for the King shield next so this
is<00:01:07.740> when<00:01:07.860> i<00:01:07.890> go<00:01:08.100> for<00:01:08.310> just<00:01:08.939> another<00:01:09.060> Swords

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570
