keyboard the layout of the keys that you
use<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:46.050> stupid<00:00:47.359> and<00:00:48.359> if<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.109> stop<00:00:49.410> looking<00:00:49.559> at

the keys and you have to look to see
where<00:00:53.519> to<00:00:53.670> put<00:00:53.699> your<00:00:53.969> fingers<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:55.320> control<00:00:55.469> it

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
playing it looks quite shocking compared

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.530 
playing it looks quite shocking compared

representing<00:02:24.010> and<00:02:24.930> how<00:02:26.010> smoothly<00:02:27.010> does<00:02:27.459> it

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
representing and how smoothly does it

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.869 
representing and how smoothly does it
actually<00:02:27.819> run<00:02:28.390> does<00:02:28.900> it<00:02:29.010> respond<00:02:30.010> to<00:02:30.430> your<00:02:30.610> key

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
actually run does it respond to your key

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:32.880 
actually run does it respond to your key
presses<00:02:31.420> within<00:02:31.900> half<00:02:32.230> an<00:02:32.410> hour<00:02:32.530> of<00:02:32.709> you

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
presses within half an hour of you

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.789 
presses within half an hour of you
pressing<00:02:33.160> the<00:02:33.400> key<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:34.150> in<00:02:34.900> this<00:02:35.079> case<00:02:35.380> yes<00:02:35.620> it

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
pressing the key and in this case yes it

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.280 
pressing the key and in this case yes it
does<00:02:36.010> finding<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.000> keys<00:02:37.209> is<00:02:37.450> a<00:02:37.480> problem<00:02:37.989> when

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
does finding the keys is a problem when

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:46.710 
does finding the keys is a problem when
you're<00:02:38.410> looking<00:02:38.680> at<00:02:38.799> the<00:02:38.890> screen<00:02:39.190> but<00:02:41.640> why

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.199 

I'll<00:02:47.290> run<00:02:48.040> away

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
no oh you Burke ah that's the farthest

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.270 
no oh you Burke ah that's the farthest
I've<00:02:58.629> got<00:02:58.870> so<00:02:59.049> far

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.110 

yeah<00:03:04.469> score<00:03:05.469> 12-under<00:03:05.829> points<00:03:06.400> that's<00:03:06.909> all

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
yeah score 12-under points that's all

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.709 
yeah score 12-under points that's all
folks

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:07.719 
folks

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:11.160 
folks
and<00:03:07.870> then<00:03:08.049> it<00:03:08.349> ends<00:03:09.219> I<00:03:09.370> could<00:03:09.819> list<00:03:10.269> it<00:03:10.510> let's

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
and then it ends I could list it let's

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:17.910 
and then it ends I could list it let's
do<00:03:11.379> that<00:03:11.620> we<00:03:11.769> can<00:03:13.170> list<00:03:15.120> that<00:03:16.120> is<00:03:16.810> your<00:03:17.319> program

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
do that we can list that is your program

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.199 
do that we can list that is your program
code<00:03:18.250> I<00:03:18.489> guess<00:03:18.909> that's<00:03:19.209> machine<00:03:19.599> code<00:03:20.189> no

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
code I guess that's machine code no

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.259 
code I guess that's machine code no
don't<00:03:22.209> know<00:03:22.420> let's<00:03:23.049> see<00:03:23.650> Willie<00:03:24.010> now<00:03:24.280> run<00:03:24.879> yes

don't know let's see Willie now run yes

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:35.199 
don't know let's see Willie now run yes
it<00:03:25.480> will<00:03:27.180> excellent<00:03:29.970> and<00:03:30.970> blares<00:03:31.569> one

looked like I want like I jumped about
raqqa<00:04:14.590> points<00:04:14.950> and<00:04:15.099> then<00:04:15.310> died<00:04:16.139> anyway<00:04:19.200> mmm

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.200 

I'm<00:04:35.860> not<00:04:36.070> sure<00:04:36.250> what<00:04:36.400> these<00:04:36.520> things<00:04:36.730> are<00:04:36.910> I'm

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
I'm not sure what these things are I'm

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.880 
I'm not sure what these things are I'm
picking<00:04:37.540> up<00:04:38.460> but<00:04:40.050> forget<00:04:41.050> points<00:04:41.380> for<00:04:41.560> them<00:04:41.770> I

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
picking up but forget points for them I

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:52.170 
picking up but forget points for them I
love<00:04:42.220> them

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.280 

no<00:04:52.780> oh<00:04:53.410> you<00:04:54.280> see<00:04:54.520> I<00:04:54.790> got<00:04:55.420> the<00:04:55.540> hundred<00:04:55.900> points

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
no oh you see I got the hundred points

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.550 
no oh you see I got the hundred points
but<00:04:56.620> then<00:04:56.800> fell<00:04:57.040> on<00:04:57.190> it<00:04:57.340> and<00:04:57.520> died<00:04:57.700> that<00:04:58.630> is<00:04:59.290> not

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
but then fell on it and died that is not

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.870 
but then fell on it and died that is not
clever<00:04:59.770> but<00:05:01.980> there<00:05:02.980> were<00:05:03.070> lots<00:05:03.250> about<00:05:03.730> the

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
clever but there were lots about the

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.250 
clever but there were lots about the
games<00:05:04.090> that<00:05:04.210> run<00:05:04.480> on<00:05:04.600> here<00:05:04.810> that<00:05:04.840> were<00:05:05.230> not

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
games that run on here that were not

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.160 
games that run on here that were not
clever<00:05:05.770> because<00:05:06.130> when<00:05:07.060> you've<00:05:07.180> only<00:05:07.300> got<00:05:07.540> 16<00:05:07.930> K

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.170 
clever because when you've only got 16 K

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.190 
clever because when you've only got 16 K
to<00:05:08.230> work<00:05:08.530> with<00:05:08.800> and<00:05:09.570> you're<00:05:10.570> running<00:05:11.050> on<00:05:11.170> a

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
to work with and you're running on a

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.570 
to work with and you're running on a
basically<00:05:12.040> crippled<00:05:12.730> Zed<00:05:13.030> expert<00:05:13.510> dead<00:05:13.780> 80

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
basically crippled Zed expert dead 80

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.610 
basically crippled Zed expert dead 80
that's<00:05:15.870> it's<00:05:16.870> running<00:05:17.140> in<00:05:17.200> what<00:05:17.350> you<00:05:17.440> call

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
that's it's running in what you call

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.710 
that's it's running in what you call
slow<00:05:18.010> mode<00:05:18.340> they<00:05:18.580> had<00:05:18.730> to<00:05:18.880> use<00:05:19.030> machine<00:05:19.420> code

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
slow mode they had to use machine code

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.350 
slow mode they had to use machine code
just<00:05:20.020> to<00:05:20.310> get<00:05:21.310> any<00:05:21.490> kind<00:05:21.820> of<00:05:21.910> sense<00:05:22.120> of<00:05:22.240> all

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
just to get any kind of sense of all

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:28.980 
just to get any kind of sense of all
usable<00:05:22.810> speed<00:05:23.200> out<00:05:23.410> of<00:05:23.590> it<00:05:25.830> we<00:05:27.420> well<00:05:28.420> I<00:05:28.450> jumped

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
usable speed out of it we well I jumped

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.410 
usable speed out of it we well I jumped
it<00:05:29.200> and<00:05:29.410> it<00:05:29.800> oh<00:05:30.010> I<00:05:30.730> see

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:31.420 
it and it oh I see

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.480 
it and it oh I see
yeah<00:05:32.020> because<00:05:32.200> the<00:05:32.470> barrel<00:05:32.860> doesn't<00:05:33.190> go<00:05:33.340> away

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
yeah because the barrel doesn't go away

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.160 
yeah because the barrel doesn't go away
when<00:05:33.880> you<00:05:33.970> jump<00:05:34.210> it<00:05:34.390> does<00:05:34.540> it<00:05:34.720> so<00:05:34.870> that's<00:05:35.080> what

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:35.170 
when you jump it does it so that's what

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:36.870 
when you jump it does it so that's what
I<00:05:35.290> was<00:05:35.440> though<00:05:36.130> these<00:05:36.340> old<00:05:36.550> that<00:05:36.670> I<00:05:36.760> was

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
I was though these old that I was

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.110 
I was though these old that I was
getting<00:05:37.030> the<00:05:37.210> oh<00:05:37.570> I've<00:05:37.930> got<00:05:38.110> the<00:05:38.230> hammer<00:05:38.440> Oh

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
getting the oh I've got the hammer Oh
