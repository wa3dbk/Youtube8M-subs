 to be able to use this service as 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.939
 so we could get first 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.470
 time have arisen 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.580
 an ATM machine and activate would be 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.719
 introduced our card 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.719
 we chose the mb net service option 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.820
 We chose a secret code from Brazil and it is 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:43.290
 at least six people 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:49.469
 it is important to remember the history and 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:53.449
 We'll put the theme in need of it. 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:01:00.930
 choose not to enter the 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:01:03.000
 from sms they did not have for the case 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.519
 do not forget years stayed in 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.280
 Quiz competitions on mobile phone 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.360
 then we choose a maximum amount of 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:17.299
 shopping by mail, this is going to be the 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:20.009
 maximum value we can create this card 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:22.650
 highlight is she who did not want to renew 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.530
 for issues in creating the card 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:30.840
 we can choose a rumor we want 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:33.150
 so we chose a little value 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.979
 above what the fields need not to 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.240
 to be unitary in any way 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.869
 I can be changed to any 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.869
 time 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.990
 this operation we will already have the card and 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.290
 then how to use this to do 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:53.790
 payments within and at the moment 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:56.430
 It's my grandson that lets you create two 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.250
 types that such a traditional card 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.370
 card can only be used one 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.890
 single voice 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:06.190
 we created the card immediately 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:09.190
 after using a discard by the 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.980
 the card mutilation the Lord for example 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.510
 to transform the work of being 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.490
 always to cards or if we 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.100
 we know how to consume more with a purchase 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.650
 we have created a card that uses and 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.080
 we can use more than once to 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.760
 the limit we chose to include 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.430
 on the traditional card 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:31.240
 imagine decision we want a card 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.530
 traditional 100 and today we make a 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.950
 payment 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:39.160
 Let's not make a cup. Let's face a 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.200
 payment for example 10 euros and this 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.260
 card abuse 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.240
 I have to create to get the soul is 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.800
 automatically canceled will continue with 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.370
 people and we make the purchase of 10 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.590
 euros 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.780
 only Mr. Jackson from contacts 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:57.930
 our account obviously the card and 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.930
 automatically year to 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:09.430
 Let's show what the delay is. 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.510
 This is not a sound and then with how 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.239
 we must proceed 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.080
 let's go to the site to fear is because it is 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.760
 beneficial or en 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:23.200
 we enter the ID that has not left 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:25.900
 taking an ATM where sms does not 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.330
 choose this option and then put 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.959
 here in the discrete code that we chose is 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.630
 which is the code that would have to take into 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.310
 mind 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.380
 then we choose card letter 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.050
 traditional card use in 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.150
 we married my traditional card 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.040
 we choose the maximum value or we 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.750
 we are creating the state-owned company because it does not stop 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:51.190
 to make a purchase of a product 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:54.010
 It costs 18 euros and so we 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.050
 we create a 20-hour card is always 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.010
 one thing can create a card with 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.439
 plus five euros for example 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.379
 that price because sometimes it pays to 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:07.920
 a 50 cent game fee improved and 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:10.769
 so they are safeguarded in the third 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.890
 step is given then the number of the 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:17.910
 extra card then the card number 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:20.039
 aims to roll stars discard 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:25.440
 these are the data that are 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:26.840
 prudent person makes a purchase with visa card 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.630
 on the Internet 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.490
 therefore we are up to is to use 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.650
 services because we are making a 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.289
 purchase does not come out of your 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:41.520
 way payment with visa card 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:45.919
 are states that put there many 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:48.810
 times to 7 that has three options visa 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:52.530
 american express mastercard normally 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:54.030
 or and aims to or is to score tried hands 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:58.530
 one employee tried the other 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:05:02.180
 deep zÃ© is sure to buy now 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:06.660
 Like how did the card stay on the plane? 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:08.250
 I'm ready for so much for 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.010
 people who do not have a credit card 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.400
 is to buy other people who despite 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:16.080
 have not like to use on the internet 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.550
 are the safest method associated with 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.520
 our debit card on the card 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.770
 ATM and discounted cash 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.050
 automatically in our account 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.060
 either be in addition to serving for those who 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.050
 do not have the card the credit card 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.760
 visa card 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.639
 also serves for those who want to make a 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.260
 purchase with one with a security 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:37.590
 additional 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.870
 I hope the click would be printed 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.900
 and that they can then make our 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:45.199
 purchases as in areas that do not accept 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.199
 life
