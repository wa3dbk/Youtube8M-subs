00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:11.440
 we review the smat 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.039
 smart time machine is the creator of 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.240
 this puzzle is my favorite puzzle 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:18.910
 the favorite piece of my collection 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.220
 as well as the most expensive or spending around 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:25.750
 50 euros abundant 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:28.480
 it's a complex puzzle too 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.730
 if I solved it I learned to solve it 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.430
 there are only two completely by eye 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.560
 switches to learn for the eventual 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.649
 parity that do not always occur 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.450
 obviously and we immediately see the 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:44.129
 features is not a spit puzzle 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:47.489
 so anyway it turned very fast 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.800
 extremely crispi hear noises 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:54.940
 but it turns really fast then 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:57.550
 after they made themselves 34 yes yes 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:01.149
 it smoothes a little inside maybe residues 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:04.140
 of plastic etc. and spends a lot 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.340
 well these are rondelline 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.640
 absolutely smith remember those 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.090
 dino square one free flowing without 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.090
 make noise 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.990
 obviously if these are not aligned 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:20.680
 the cube does not turn the cube let's call it 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:24.909
 basically it is a cube 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:27.880
 middle ground between a 2x2 is a 4x4 in the 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:31.119
 sense that i solve it by doing i first 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.829
 centers and I do them like a 2x2 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:40.090
 because it is a 2x2 in effect e 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:45.420
 after which I resolve these washers here 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:48.909
 reasoning as I reason with a 4x4 ie 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.590
 I get down and the piece took him up 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.500
 how the centers are impacted a little 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.579
 for 4 or any bi cube then a 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.079
 trinci cover cin along for himself the 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.030
 I usually don't review them 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:02.920
 but in this case it must be done because it is not 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.610
 then find around in commerce 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:11.950
 these you must keep are excellent 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:14.530
 color the standard set now call 651 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.280
 there is little to say are the classic colors 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:23.920
 of the quality rubik cube is vinyl 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:25.269
 now stockings 51 when you buy it polish 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.060
 anyway it also sends a set of 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:30.519
 reserve then you are calm also 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.920
 that way there is a feature that you don't 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:37.900
 it's good for nothing but a lot of fun 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:40.120
 cutting the cube in defense of it 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.459
 reads around absolutely at a good 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:46.830
 size is of no use because the cone 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.830
 you will never cut but it has a good cut 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:54.910
 here is another nice feature 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:58.209
 now I put the little light see this 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.390
 dot that there is in chapter 6 and this 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:06.040
 dot what's here these go 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:08.920
 the cup is aligned with the 6 and there is a 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.470
 hole that is line with the hole that is here 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.239
 with the screwdriver you can enter there is a 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.450
 life opens you can disassemble 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.250
 puzzles then a bit of a secret system 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.799
 to access this which is proposed 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.620
 a machine as a mysterious object 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:27.910
 of time wants to be a car of the 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.950
 time the puzzle is inspired by the puzzle 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:33.340
 historic smart alex who is no longer in 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.530
 production but also inspired by time 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.389
 machine of the homonymous film 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.760
 film the time machine a historian too 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:43.030
 what had these wheels that 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:46.090
 they went around like that here they were phase 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.100
 very nice very nice to see 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.370
 having it in the collection is expensive 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.720
 know however they are calling to the speed puzzles 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.980
 who makes the collection in my opinion 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.250
 this is a piece to have because of it 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:00.190
 there are about 200 to 250 specimens and 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.870
 150 have been sold in Italy 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:06.799
 maybe we are two or three to have it 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.239
 in short, before they finish I think that 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:10.849
 be the case to buy it if you want 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:15.590
 make the collection because from what I know 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:18.169
 will not be built in bulk version 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.500
 so it will not be spread in thousands of 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:22.970
 couples so what to say if you are 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.070
 interested buy it while you are in 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.080
 time before they finish and who has it 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.669
 will never sell it again this is little but 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.050
 sure 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:32.530
 there is nothing else to say the dimensions are 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.870
 about 6 and a half centimeters more or less a 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.910
 lanlan 4x4 up and down 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.889
 so a standard 4x4 size does not 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.199
 shanxi 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:43.639
 I have nothing else to say about this cube ve 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:45.770
 I advise 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:49.220
 it turns very well the pieces are excellent 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:51.590
 quality the pieces are produced from mf 8 e 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.050
 designed by maz 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.280
 if you need to contact him personally 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.889
 on the pad on the forum 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.090
 sad puzzles because it answers you from there and 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:01.250
 in short, it organizes an expedition 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.380
 staff for this puzzle asks for 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.870
 maybe a discount because you ask 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:08.180
 came around $ 70 can 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.870
 to remove a little something is nothing 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.669
 other to say 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.820
 a beautiful puzzle is the favorite 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:14.930
 of my collection absolutely 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:17.410
 recommended and see you next time 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.410
 review
