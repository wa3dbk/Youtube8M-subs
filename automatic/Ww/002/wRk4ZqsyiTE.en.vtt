there<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.400> some<00:01:14.670> validity<00:01:14.970> in<00:01:15.270> these<00:01:15.420> claims

as<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.350> brain<00:01:16.590> can<00:01:16.890> be<00:01:16.920> continually<00:01:17.820> improved

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
as the brain can be continually improved

as the brain can be continually improved
with<00:01:18.630> practice<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:19.500> think<00:01:19.650> that's<00:01:19.950> what<00:01:20.130> these

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
with practice I think that's what these

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.480 
with practice I think that's what these
apps<00:01:20.490> really<00:01:21.299> are<00:01:21.479> talking<00:01:21.900> about<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.560> not

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
apps really are talking about is is not

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.190 
apps really are talking about is is not
so<00:01:23.640> much<00:01:23.759> improving<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.330> eye<00:01:24.360> but<00:01:24.840> improving

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
so much improving the eye but improving

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.469 
so much improving the eye but improving
the<00:01:25.409> brain<00:01:25.650> because<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.280> brain<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.790> actually

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
the brain because the brain is actually

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.749
