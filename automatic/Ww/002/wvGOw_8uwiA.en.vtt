00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.020
 residents of Ukraine began to stock up the most 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.120

 suggests also to limit some 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.570
 social benefits all this despite the fact that 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.849
 Ukraine has already dropped in level 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.310
 the minimum wage is even lower

 you can see quite different prices 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.170
 life in Ukraine is rapidly going up 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.629
 and now everything is divided by 3 and the price will be 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.090
 which is fair to all divide by 3 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.789

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.100
 but on the utility discounts in payments 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.320
 the state will not beg for tariffs 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.360
 increased many times while Ukrainian

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.189

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.369
 two thirds go to utility bills 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.619
 for life remains hryvnia 500 probably

 but opinion polls 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.170
