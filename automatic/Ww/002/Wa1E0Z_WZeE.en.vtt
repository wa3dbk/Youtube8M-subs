this is the greatest advance in modern

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.619 
this is the greatest advance in modern
physics<00:00:08.160> since<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:09.120> splitting<00:00:09.419> of<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.570> atom

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:09.629 
physics since the splitting of the atom

a rare metal molecularly unstable it's
what<00:00:20.580> they're<00:00:20.789> made<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:24.920> break<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:26.039> up<00:00:26.130> all<00:00:27.060> the

dad he keeps spending money on junk I
don't<00:00:33.870> think<00:00:33.990> it's<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.140> truck<00:00:34.320> at<00:00:34.440> all<00:00:34.500> I<00:00:34.830> think

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
don't think it's a truck at all I think

don't think it's a truck at all I think
we<00:00:35.640> just<00:00:35.730> found<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:36.000> transformer<00:00:41.870> I'm<00:00:42.870> gonna

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
we just found a transformer I'm gonna

we just found a transformer I'm gonna
ask<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.320> this<00:00:43.440> once<00:00:44.270> where<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.390> Optimus<00:00:45.570> Prime

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
after all we have done

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.110 
after all we have done
humans<00:00:57.150> are<00:00:57.540> hunting<00:00:58.260> us

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.959 

but<00:01:01.270> I<00:01:01.300> fear<00:01:01.960> we<00:01:02.260> are<00:01:02.290> all<00:01:02.740> targets<00:01:03.670> now

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:05.969 
but I fear we are all targets now

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:20.700 
but I fear we are all targets now
what<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:08.030> you<00:01:09.030> said<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:10.079> here

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.219 

this<00:01:21.710> is<00:01:22.130> not<00:01:22.460> war

this is not war
it's<00:01:24.650> human<00:01:25.280> extinction

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.560 

more<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.600> my<00:01:42.810> kind<00:01:43.110> must<00:01:43.680> be<00:01:43.860> sacrificed

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
more of my kind must be sacrificed

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.600 
more of my kind must be sacrificed
and<00:01:45.780> half<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.170> prime<00:01:46.530> maybe<00:01:47.250> not<00:01:47.460> new<00:01:47.700> we<00:01:47.850> all

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
and half a prime maybe not new we all

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.139 
and half a prime maybe not new we all
know<00:01:50.610> we<00:01:50.790> can<00:01:50.820> be

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149
