00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 the social responsibility movement all that are not political movements 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.450
 inept and allies there has been a very interesting book that is more 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.450
 deep the peru 

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:18.480
 to enter 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.449
 reggie fils you in your fief the tucu 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.629
 have its headquarter 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.619
 if you resign 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.760
 the question remains valid to this day 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.660
 finally on the subject 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.360
 For decades, they have been looking for an answer 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.360
 and we always end up blaming it at the end 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.960
 it is easier to say that our Peru was sunk by the agrarian reform of 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:47.850
 candle 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.770
 because side of an importance to terrorism 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.090
 because of the first government of alan p is a train loaded with inflation and 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.670
 economic inoperability 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.330
 because of alcohol 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.550
 the vladivideos and the corruption in Fujimori's government because of the 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.540
 whiskeys and the cabana hour ni 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.450
 because of the majority of the political class that governed the government of the 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.500
 Peru and that continues to live in scandal and corruption 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.070
 but as much as we want to offer our responsibility for the crisis 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.410
 social activity that suffocates Peru 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.010
 We share too many habits that make us very similar to those we like and 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.200
 we criticize 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.180
 because we still believe that the criollada has to be celebrated as if it were part 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.170
 of national pride 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.159
 We are not worthy and that's why we buy invoices to pay less taxes 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.210
 we won the jobs not because of our talent effort 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.790
 if you do not do it to a small commotion 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.950
 we line up in line to be served 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.970
 we accelerate in tangerines we pass the red light 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.530
 because if they arrive faster and faster 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.930
 we are friends that if we do not find parking we put ourselves in the 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.930
 Blue space reserved for people with disabilities 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.680
 we roll the cable signal 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.140
 we test electricity and we do not consider ourselves thieves 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.600
 We demand justice and corruption is over 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.009
 but we pay 5 soles to a policeman so that he does not give us ballots 

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:14.919
 He came to the judge to plead our cause 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:20.049
 We never give the pass to a passer-by in the pedestrian crossing because in Peru 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.709
 also the electoral tribunal 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.929
 but if we are so alive 

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:28.789
 because we are making them the red light as if that made you listen 

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:30.289
 Our city 

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:32.609
 because we throw the garbage in the street 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:35.609
 as if the city belonged to anyone but us 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:40.080
 because we remain silent we do not protest when the driver of the combi 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:42.759
 he does not stop committing imprudence 

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:46.999
 because we are so interested in knowing is the process through 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:47.720
 players 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.139
 instead of knowing something about our history our 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:55.559
 girl our literature or at least know what our rights are more 

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:58.949
 elementary because we feel that we are doing ourselves a favor 

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:01.619
 when a state employee takes care of us 

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:05.469
 because we let a panettone be the best argument of a politician to 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:06.899
 take our vote 

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:10.829
 because when someone does something right we tell them that it seems done in the 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:11.790
 Foreign 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.520
 as if that was more meritorious because we are not proud of our 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.340
 cultural diversity and why if we are so alive 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.300
 we continue to feed this vicious circle that does not allow us to advance as 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.909
 society and nation 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:29.239
 it is true that our educational levels antenna 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.689
 and if we want to become a country with possibilities for development we have to 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:36.729
 invest in schools and train teachers 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:40.919
 but that it would not be a good education away from home when between 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:44.039
 a camus to our children giving them the worst example 

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:47.779
 It is true that urgent measures are needed to stop the wave of 

00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:51.949
 crime and violence that plagues the country found that it will not work 

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:55.769
 pacify the streets when our homes physical violence and 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.029
 psychological seems to have been institutionalized 

00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:03.249
 It is true that true judicial reform is needed so that in Peru 

00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:05.109
 can speak of justice 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:09.709
 I was convinced that it would be achieved when most of us and endorsing the law 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:11.019
 of the strongest 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.319
 of the richest 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.139
 of the most alive 

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:17.609
 it is true that to reduce the social conflicts that require 

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:20.879
 but that dialogue will not work 

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:25.110
 if we continue thinking that dialogue is imposing our ideas and not listening to the 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.639
 who thinks differently from us 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.010
 it is true that we need better laws of social inclusion 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.870
 and a lot more integration projects 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.749
 but in which these laws and projects will not serve 

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:40.699
 yes to this day and the publicity but they will define our strata 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:45.729
 socioeconomic by the color of the skin and nobody seems strange is the day 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:48.900
 today we continue to be ashamed of our differences 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.289
 we feel superior for these same reasons 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:56.569
 it's true it's much easier to blame absolutely everything on 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:05:00.869
 our rulers but the reality is that the peru sink exact 

00:05:00.869 --> 00:05:05.129
 proportion to that currency that we feed all day after day 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:09.439
 5 we are the raw material with which this country is made 

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:11.620
 and if we do not correct our habits 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.930
 if our raw material if any citizen any product we make 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.699
 there will also be mercy and for more achievements we have in our economy 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:23.130
 in sports in the arts in our kitchen 

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:27.779
 no matter how proud we feel of our representatives of our 

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:28.610
 history 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:29.979
 that our wonders 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:31.569
 today our creativity 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:35.169
 if we do not change these habits we will continue to ask ourselves 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:38.020
 when did Peru get fucked 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.250
 I'm sick of that question 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.870
 I'm tired of seeing how a country with so many possibilities and opportunities 

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:48.169
 with so many natural riches and with so much history 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:52.080
 I have to keep living in their developments just because we do not believe 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.479
 able to live differently 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:58.080
 I'm sick of the misfortunes of our neighbors will be our best 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.430
 comfort 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:04.440
 fed up that he can be just a little phrase made for a party of 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.369
 football and that we can not apply it in our life 

00:06:07.369 --> 00:06:08.999
 although it costs you to believe it 

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:10.159
 if we can 

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:11.589
 Of course we can 

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:16.410
 but it's up to you and me to start working on it and once and for all 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:20.260
 because the transformation of the country towards a developed nation no longer 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.260
 is alone in the heads of politicians or the powerful 

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:27.840
 It is not in the field of miracles the transformation of Peru is in the 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.760
 capacity that we have to take responsibility for our actions and 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:34.050
 rebel against our live 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.360
 the transformation of Peru is in Kyrgyzstan 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.750
 is in all these organizations 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.580
 and in the possibility of working 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.580
 together with true social responsibility 

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:49.129
 what would happen if we changed the question 

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:51.669
 if for example now he asked 

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:54.990
 the moment the alleged tanneries were fixed 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.699
 even if it seems like a question too 

00:06:57.699 --> 00:06:59.469
 we have to believe in him 

00:06:59.469 --> 00:07:02.669
 and the answer is what is in our hands 

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:05.669
 social responsibility please 

00:07:07.819 --> 00:07:10.620
 three years later it does not seem exactly with Monday 

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.460
 coninagro d social responsibility
