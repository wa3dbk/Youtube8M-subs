00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.849
 Hi, how are you? I'm going to teach you today. 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.849
 destruction only knowing that he is well 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:51.450
 but also on the wheel 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:58.590
 you will need a forceps of a 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:02:01.320
 cd box of a knife from a pen and 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.810
 also a ruler 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:08.099
 so people at the beginning of the video I did 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:11.879
 with ruler and pen yes wear shorts and 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.360
 measuring where to cut and 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.310
 such 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.720
 Only when I just shocked everything. 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.140
 that I went to see that I was not recording 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:22.500
 For you guys like I did I scored with 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.890
 only ruler I put in and is not 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:29.730
 only you how to do those ied in short 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:32.340
 Good, and very easy, good, then you? 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.920
 put a cd box inside the shorts 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.410
 so as not to run the risk of cutting part 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.629
 from below too and such I will join if 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.110
 the two parties to be anguished well 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:44.910
 great bm of bento history 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.940
 so you cut with the knife the good in 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.190
 she parades as she cuts then 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.190
 You count the knife and it slides with the 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.980
 car was cutting cooling down how many 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.440
 times as needed but do not depend 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.540
 you see that more or less shredded I 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.330
 I prefer a very shredded one that looks good 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.909
 pretty modern pretty with the tweezers going 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.129
 pulling these white lines to 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:09.030
 well visible to stay more 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.129
 beautiful 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.890
 You see, you're pulling them too hard. 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.909
 delicacy of the seam to stay 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.250
 invisible 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:19.290
 you have to be careful not to cut the 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.260
 total because we do not want to be alone 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:29.909
 a hole in the mall today that these 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:31.440
 white lines so now we go 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:33.959
 cut the top 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.299
 only that the top of it had the pocket in 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:39.480
 So I can see that you do not cut the 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:42.450
 pocket I went up so as not to risk 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.909
 cut seeing there will be fine destroys 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.459
 leaving without cutting a bag or 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:49.590
 girls please, or you'll put a 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.590
 thing in her pocket she 'll drop such a thing 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:55.500
 careful with a knot 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.590
 so I did the same afip knife process 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.720
 think of the other side of the shorts now in that 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.519
 side did the same thing exactly 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.610
 put the cd 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:08.430
 I went with the knife cutting and undoing 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.300
 so I made two lines one below the 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.910
 other 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.670
 Because I did it I made rosinha and 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:19.950
 I cut from above and now I like it from below 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:22.860
 and will it where I can not in iron and 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:26.010
 now with that jeans line left over in the 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.110
 I'll cut and divert it until I 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:32.940
 appear on all your lines 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:34.950
 stitching then you see it with the tweezers 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:38.160
 you leave all the excess of 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:40.680
 jeans will take off all jeans to stay 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.620
 alone that the people who will be well 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.610
 Beautiful people, it's very cute. 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.100
 have to have a little patience 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.400
 but it gets much more behind I made the 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.630
 same thing from the front right 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.000
 I tapped the pen where I wanted it 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.740
 cut 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.950
 I cut with the knife to be well 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:01.170
 I went down with the car and took the 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.720
 excess jeans copies 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:07.230
 So you 're ready to see how it looks. 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.270
 destroyed but beautiful and modern. 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.860
 very easy to do, people 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.380
 What do you do with things you have at home? 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.770
 You do not even have to spend money on 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:20.640
 nothing and look good you can spruce with 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:25.240
 Stacks whatever you want it stays and ram 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:34.860
 by 6 to 1 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:34.860
 but reads is not to like
