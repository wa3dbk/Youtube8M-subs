you<00:00:14.099> can<00:00:14.370> get<00:00:14.610> inside<00:00:14.880> of<00:00:15.059> cydia<00:00:15.360> called<00:00:15.750> 3d

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
you can get inside of cydia called 3d

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.320 
you can get inside of cydia called 3d
board<00:00:16.619> so<00:00:17.190> yesterday<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:17.820> showed<00:00:18.060> you<00:00:18.180> guys<00:00:18.270> a

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
board so yesterday I showed you guys a

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.050 
board so yesterday I showed you guys a
tweak<00:00:18.720> called<00:00:18.750> deep<00:00:19.350> end<00:00:19.619> which<00:00:20.160> did<00:00:20.520> exactly

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
tweak called deep end which did exactly

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.210 
tweak called deep end which did exactly
the<00:00:21.359> same<00:00:21.390> thing<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:22.140> made<00:00:22.320> your<00:00:22.500> background

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
the same thing it made your background

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.509 
the same thing it made your background
have<00:00:23.820> sort<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.269> 3d<00:00:24.779> like<00:00:24.960> appearance<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.710> it

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
have sort of a 3d like appearance and it

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.419 
have sort of a 3d like appearance and it
was<00:00:26.880> free<00:00:27.330> inside<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.900> cydia<00:00:28.230> well<00:00:28.560> today<00:00:29.130> I'm

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
was free inside of cydia well today I'm

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.429 
was free inside of cydia well today I'm
showing<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:30.060> guys<00:00:30.119> 3d<00:00:30.810> board<00:00:31.080> which<00:00:31.289> was

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
showing you guys 3d board which was

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.400 
showing you guys 3d board which was
actually<00:00:31.710> announced<00:00:32.340> first<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.170> it<00:00:34.170> actually

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
actually announced first and it actually

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.830 
actually announced first and it actually
uses<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.920> different<00:00:35.399> method<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.239> accomplish

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
uses a different method to accomplish

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.889 
uses a different method to accomplish
the<00:00:36.989> same<00:00:37.200> exact<00:00:37.620> thing<00:00:37.890> now<00:00:38.489> 3d<00:00:39.030> board<00:00:39.270> is<00:00:39.600> two

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
the same exact thing now 3d board is two

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.170 
the same exact thing now 3d board is two
dollars<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.530> ninety-nine<00:00:40.890> cents<00:00:41.460> inside<00:00:42.000> of

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
dollars and ninety-nine cents inside of

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.750 
dollars and ninety-nine cents inside of
cydia<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.890> basically<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.100> difference<00:00:44.550> is

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
cydia and basically the difference is

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.250 
cydia and basically the difference is
deepened<00:00:45.450> actually<00:00:46.110> uses<00:00:46.829> your<00:00:47.730> gyroscope<00:00:48.480> so

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
deepened actually uses your gyroscope so

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.709 
deepened actually uses your gyroscope so
it<00:00:49.590> will<00:00:49.770> only<00:00:50.010> work<00:00:50.399> for<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.730> iphone<00:00:51.210> 4<00:00:51.570> and

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
it will only work for the iphone 4 and

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.209 
it will only work for the iphone 4 and
the<00:00:52.289> ipod<00:00:52.770> touch<00:00:53.010> 4th<00:00:53.340> generation<00:00:54.050> whereas<00:00:55.219> 3d

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
the ipod touch 4th generation whereas 3d

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.619 
the ipod touch 4th generation whereas 3d
board<00:00:56.520> actually<00:00:56.789> just<00:00:57.239> uses<00:00:57.510> your

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
board actually just uses your

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.020 
board actually just uses your
accelerometer<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.129> will<00:00:59.370> work<00:00:59.699> with<00:00:59.879> any

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
accelerometer so it will work with any

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.420 
accelerometer so it will work with any
iDevice<00:01:00.809> which<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.289> really<00:01:01.620> really<00:01:01.829> nice<00:01:02.100> and

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
iDevice which is really really nice and

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.609 
iDevice which is really really nice and
really<00:01:02.489> cool<00:01:03.059> all<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.809> have<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.049> do<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.290> get<00:01:04.470> it

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
really cool all you have to do to get it

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.039 
really cool all you have to do to get it
actually<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.159> just<00:01:05.339> go<00:01:05.549> inside<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.970> cydia<00:01:06.420> then

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
actually is just go inside of cydia then

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.630 
actually is just go inside of cydia then
one<00:01:07.229> city<00:01:07.530> has<00:01:07.680> loaded<00:01:07.890> up<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.280> just<00:01:08.460> go<00:01:08.580> to

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
one city has loaded up you just go to

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.580 
one city has loaded up you just go to
the<00:01:08.790> search<00:01:09.030> tab<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:10.140> just<00:01:10.350> search<00:01:10.560> for

scroll down till you get to 3d board and

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.200 
scroll down till you get to 3d board and
then<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.619> cannot<00:01:44.040> enable<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.030> can

then you cannot enable it and you can

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.260 
then you cannot enable it and you can
change<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.840> depth<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.680> uses<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.610> first

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
change the depth that it uses so first

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.660 
change the depth that it uses so first
of<00:01:48.450> all<00:01:48.509> I'm<00:01:48.720> going<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.110> say<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.310> lot<00:01:50.640> of

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
of all I'm going to say that a lot of

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.399 
of all I'm going to say that a lot of
people<00:01:51.030> are<00:01:51.119> actually<00:01:51.299> having<00:01:51.810> issues<00:01:52.380> with

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
people are actually having issues with

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.950 
people are actually having issues with
3d<00:01:53.009> board<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:54.000> what<00:01:54.299> you're<00:01:54.420> going<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.659> have<00:01:54.780> to

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
3d board so what you're going to have to

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.999 
3d board so what you're going to have to
do<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.380> first<00:01:56.090> respring<00:01:57.090> your<00:01:57.659> iDevice<00:01:58.409> after

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
do is first respring your iDevice after

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.280 
do is first respring your iDevice after
you<00:01:59.159> install<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.840> manually<00:02:00.840> you're<00:02:01.079> going<00:02:01.200> to

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
you install it manually you're going to

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.660 
you install it manually you're going to
have<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.530> do<00:02:01.649> it<00:02:01.829> with<00:02:02.040> something<00:02:02.430> like

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
have to do it with something like

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.730 
have to do it with something like
sbsettings<00:02:03.390> after<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.170> forces<00:02:04.590> you<00:02:04.710> to

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
sbsettings after it forces you to

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.469 
sbsettings after it forces you to
respring<00:02:05.310> inside<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.700> cydia<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:06.270> you're<00:02:06.390> going

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
respring inside a cydia so you're going

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.510 
respring inside a cydia so you're going
to<00:02:06.570> have<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.780> respring<00:02:07.229> twice<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:07.920> then<00:02:08.399> what

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
to have to respring twice and then what

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.680 
to have to respring twice and then what
you're<00:02:08.640> going<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.819> have<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.090> do<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.539> you're

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
you're going to have to do is you're

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.960 
you're going to have to do is you're
going<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:10.020> have<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.410> toggle<00:02:10.890> on<00:02:11.340> and

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
going to have to toggle on and

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.750 
going to have to toggle on and
off<00:02:12.060> 3d<00:02:12.630> board<00:02:12.990> about<00:02:13.710> three<00:02:14.190> different<00:02:14.310> times

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
off 3d board about three different times

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.490 
off 3d board about three different times
so<00:02:14.970> you<00:02:15.060> just<00:02:15.240> want<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.480> keep<00:02:15.630> toggling<00:02:16.170> it<00:02:16.290> on

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
so you just want to keep toggling it on

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.650 
so you just want to keep toggling it on
and<00:02:16.740> off<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:17.130> then<00:02:17.670> what<00:02:17.970> you<00:02:18.090> can<00:02:18.120> do<00:02:18.450> is<00:02:18.630> just

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
and off and then what you can do is just

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.750 
and off and then what you can do is just
set<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.230> depth<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.680> whatever<00:02:19.890> you<00:02:20.040> like<00:02:20.250> so

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
set the depth to whatever you like so

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.430 
set the depth to whatever you like so
I'm<00:02:20.820> going<00:02:20.880> to<00:02:21.030> demonstrate<00:02:21.240> it<00:02:21.690> with<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:21.840> very

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
I'm going to demonstrate it with a very

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.280 
I'm going to demonstrate it with a very
very<00:02:22.770> low<00:02:23.160> depth<00:02:23.520> and<00:02:23.760> show<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.510> guys<00:02:24.660> what<00:02:25.200> it

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
very low depth and show you guys what it

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.130 
very low depth and show you guys what it
looks<00:02:25.320> like<00:02:25.770> with<00:02:26.190> that<00:02:26.520> so<00:02:27.330> here<00:02:27.600> it<00:02:27.720> is<00:02:27.750> and

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
looks like with that so here it is and

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.290 
looks like with that so here it is and
I'm<00:02:28.290> really<00:02:28.620> zoomed<00:02:29.010> in<00:02:29.250> on<00:02:29.280> it<00:02:29.580> there<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:30.030> I'm

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
I'm really zoomed in on it there and I'm

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.940 
I'm really zoomed in on it there and I'm
just<00:02:30.540> going<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.870> show<00:02:31.020> you<00:02:31.260> guys<00:02:31.380> that<00:02:31.530> you<00:02:31.800> can

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
just going to show you guys that you can

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.920 
just going to show you guys that you can
barely<00:02:32.280> even<00:02:32.460> notice<00:02:32.910> it<00:02:33.090> I<00:02:33.240> think<00:02:33.810> it<00:02:33.900> looks

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
barely even notice it I think it looks

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.230 
barely even notice it I think it looks
really<00:02:34.170> really<00:02:34.770> nice<00:02:34.950> with<00:02:35.310> a<00:02:35.340> lower<00:02:35.820> depth

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
really really nice with a lower depth

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.480 
really really nice with a lower depth
though<00:02:36.570> because<00:02:37.080> it<00:02:37.320> just<00:02:37.470> gives<00:02:37.710> it<00:02:37.860> a<00:02:38.100> really

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
though because it just gives it a really

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.780 
though because it just gives it a really
really<00:02:38.820> awesome<00:02:39.180> 3d<00:02:39.930> effect<00:02:40.550> because<00:02:41.550> you<00:02:41.670> can

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
really awesome 3d effect because you can

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.700 
really awesome 3d effect because you can
actually<00:02:42.000> almost<00:02:42.420> it<00:02:42.870> almost<00:02:42.900> looks<00:02:43.470> like<00:02:43.530> you

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
actually almost it almost looks like you

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.860 
actually almost it almost looks like you
can<00:02:43.860> see<00:02:44.100> behind<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.610> icons<00:02:45.150> which<00:02:45.390> I<00:02:45.510> really

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
can see behind the icons which I really

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.110 
can see behind the icons which I really
really<00:02:46.110> like<00:02:46.320> that<00:02:46.620> and<00:02:46.860> I<00:02:47.490> think<00:02:47.730> it<00:02:47.850> looks

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
really like that and I think it looks

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.260 
really like that and I think it looks
just<00:02:48.270> absolutely<00:02:49.140> amazing<00:02:49.670> so<00:02:50.670> I'm<00:02:51.030> also

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
just absolutely amazing so I'm also

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.120 
just absolutely amazing so I'm also
going<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:51.780> just<00:02:52.020> go<00:02:52.140> ahead<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:52.380> change<00:02:52.860> it

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
going to just go ahead and change it

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.100 
going to just go ahead and change it
here<00:02:53.340> really<00:02:53.610> quick<00:02:53.820> and<00:02:53.970> show<00:02:54.600> you<00:02:54.660> guys<00:02:54.840> what

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
here really quick and show you guys what

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.170 
here really quick and show you guys what
it<00:02:55.200> looks<00:02:55.230> like<00:02:55.620> with<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.100> depth<00:02:56.370> all<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:57.060> way

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
it looks like with the depth all the way

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.230 
it looks like with the depth all the way
up<00:02:57.470> so<00:02:58.470> now<00:02:58.650> it<00:02:58.800> is<00:02:59.040> all<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.580> way<00:02:59.670> up<00:02:59.850> and<00:03:00.060> it<00:03:00.209> is

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
up so now it is all the way up and it is

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.210 
up so now it is all the way up and it is
really<00:03:00.660> jittery<00:03:01.170> like<00:03:01.560> for<00:03:01.800> instance<00:03:01.860> if

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
really jittery like for instance if

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.530 
really jittery like for instance if
you're<00:03:02.370> just<00:03:02.610> jittering<00:03:02.970> your<00:03:03.150> phone<00:03:03.390> or

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
you're just jittering your phone or

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.110 
you're just jittering your phone or
you're<00:03:03.660> walking<00:03:03.900> around<00:03:04.260> with<00:03:04.680> it<00:03:04.830> then<00:03:05.490> it

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
you're walking around with it then it

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.750 
you're walking around with it then it
will<00:03:06.420> look<00:03:06.720> kind<00:03:07.050> of<00:03:07.140> weird<00:03:07.200> and<00:03:08.100> it<00:03:08.250> can<00:03:08.490> get

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
will look kind of weird and it can get

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.730 
will look kind of weird and it can get
really<00:03:09.120> really<00:03:09.360> annoying<00:03:09.630> but<00:03:10.290> I'm<00:03:10.530> just

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
really really annoying but I'm just

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.290 
really really annoying but I'm just
going<00:03:10.950> to<00:03:10.980> go<00:03:11.130> ahead<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:11.520> get<00:03:11.910> a<00:03:11.970> close<00:03:12.270> up

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
going to go ahead and get a close up

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.180 
going to go ahead and get a close up
here<00:03:12.570> and<00:03:13.020> show<00:03:13.080> you<00:03:13.680> guys<00:03:13.860> what<00:03:14.070> it<00:03:14.160> looks

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
here and show you guys what it looks

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.910 
here and show you guys what it looks
like<00:03:14.550> now<00:03:15.120> it<00:03:15.720> doesn't<00:03:16.170> actually<00:03:16.320> really<00:03:16.769> look

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
like now it doesn't actually really look

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.220 
like now it doesn't actually really look
that<00:03:16.950> smooth<00:03:17.670> I<00:03:17.940> actually<00:03:18.390> think<00:03:18.720> deep<00:03:19.019> end

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
that smooth I actually think deep end

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.680 
that smooth I actually think deep end
looks<00:03:19.470> way<00:03:19.830> smoother<00:03:20.459> when<00:03:20.640> it's<00:03:20.820> zoomed<00:03:21.450> in

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
looks way smoother when it's zoomed in

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.440 
looks way smoother when it's zoomed in
more<00:03:21.930> like<00:03:22.140> that<00:03:22.410> and<00:03:22.620> when<00:03:22.940> all<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.150> settings

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
more like that and when all the settings

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.300 
more like that and when all the settings
on<00:03:24.630> deepened<00:03:25.080> are<00:03:25.230> turned<00:03:25.530> all<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:25.800> way<00:03:26.010> up<00:03:26.040> I

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
on deepened are turned all the way up I

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.330 
on deepened are turned all the way up I
think<00:03:26.370> it<00:03:26.580> looks<00:03:26.610> a<00:03:26.940> lot<00:03:27.180> better<00:03:27.510> but<00:03:28.410> this<00:03:29.100> one

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
think it looks a lot better but this one

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.090 
think it looks a lot better but this one
does<00:03:29.640> work<00:03:29.910> with<00:03:30.120> all<00:03:30.300> iDevices<00:03:31.140> and<00:03:31.320> I<00:03:31.800> like

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
does work with all iDevices and I like

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.920 
does work with all iDevices and I like
it<00:03:32.340> a<00:03:32.459> lot<00:03:32.489> when<00:03:33.030> it's<00:03:33.209> turned<00:03:33.390> all<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.750> way

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
it a lot when it's turned all the way

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.100 
it a lot when it's turned all the way
down<00:03:34.260> so<00:03:34.800> I<00:03:34.830> like<00:03:35.550> it<00:03:35.760> better<00:03:36.030> than<00:03:36.630> deep<00:03:36.900> end

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
down so I like it better than deep end

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.530 
down so I like it better than deep end
in<00:03:37.260> some<00:03:37.500> aspects<00:03:38.040> but<00:03:38.220> in<00:03:38.370> others<00:03:38.670> I<00:03:38.700> don't

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
in some aspects but in others I don't

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.630 
in some aspects but in others I don't
think<00:03:39.780> it's<00:03:39.900> as<00:03:40.019> good<00:03:40.170> as<00:03:40.320> deep<00:03:40.530> end<00:03:40.769> also<00:03:41.610> I

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
think it's as good as deep end also I

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.330 
think it's as good as deep end also I
think<00:03:41.970> this<00:03:42.510> tweak<00:03:42.900> actually<00:03:43.500> only<00:03:43.709> really

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
think this tweak actually only really

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.300 
think this tweak actually only really
works<00:03:44.640> with<00:03:45.500> wallpapers<00:03:46.500> that<00:03:46.680> have<00:03:46.860> a<00:03:46.890> bunch

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
works with wallpapers that have a bunch

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.560 
works with wallpapers that have a bunch
of<00:03:47.459> different<00:03:47.580> things<00:03:48.000> on<00:03:48.150> it<00:03:48.239> like<00:03:48.360> for

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
of different things on it like for

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.780 
of different things on it like for
instance<00:03:48.630> this<00:03:49.019> bubble<00:03:49.470> wallpaper<00:03:50.010> it<00:03:50.370> works

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
instance this bubble wallpaper it works

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.490 
instance this bubble wallpaper it works
really<00:03:51.209> well<00:03:51.390> with<00:03:51.750> that<00:03:51.989> because<00:03:52.170> it<00:03:52.350> has<00:03:52.470> a

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
really well with that because it has a

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.259 
really well with that because it has a
bunch<00:03:52.769> of<00:03:52.890> different<00:03:53.040> reference<00:03:53.700> points<00:03:54.150> so

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
bunch of different reference points so

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:55.789 
bunch of different reference points so
you<00:03:54.360> can<00:03:54.510> actually<00:03:54.690> see<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:55.350> wallpaper

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
you can actually see the wallpaper

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.920 
you can actually see the wallpaper
moving<00:03:56.310> but<00:03:56.850> I'm<00:03:57.030> just<00:03:57.390> going<00:03:57.570> to<00:03:57.630> go<00:03:57.720> ahead

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
moving but I'm just going to go ahead

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.020 
moving but I'm just going to go ahead
and<00:03:58.260> change<00:03:58.560> the<00:03:58.890> wallpaper<00:03:59.100> really<00:03:59.790> quick

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
and change the wallpaper really quick

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.180 
and change the wallpaper really quick
and<00:04:00.209> I'm<00:04:00.840> going<00:04:01.080> to<00:04:01.140> show<00:04:01.410> you<00:04:01.470> guys<00:04:01.709> what<00:04:02.070> it

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
and I'm going to show you guys what it

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.910 
and I'm going to show you guys what it
looks<00:04:02.220> like<00:04:02.700> when<00:04:03.269> I<00:04:03.330> have<00:04:03.930> a<00:04:03.959> different<00:04:04.290> just

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
looks like when I have a different just

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.789 
looks like when I have a different just
normal<00:04:05.610> standard<00:04:06.180> wallpaper<00:04:06.750> so<00:04:07.320> now<00:04:07.560> I've

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
normal standard wallpaper so now I've

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.370 
normal standard wallpaper so now I've
changed<00:04:08.190> the<00:04:08.430> wallpaper<00:04:08.640> and<00:04:09.360> as<00:04:10.049> you<00:04:10.200> can<00:04:10.350> see

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
changed the wallpaper and as you can see

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.860 
changed the wallpaper and as you can see
you<00:04:11.310> can't<00:04:11.670> even<00:04:11.760> really<00:04:12.060> notice<00:04:12.360> that<00:04:12.720> it's

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
you can't even really notice that it's

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.710 
you can't even really notice that it's
turning<00:04:13.410> that<00:04:13.739> much<00:04:14.070> I<00:04:14.280> mean<00:04:14.730> if<00:04:14.910> you<00:04:15.030> focus<00:04:15.510> on

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
turning that much I mean if you focus on

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.120 
turning that much I mean if you focus on
certain<00:04:15.989> things<00:04:16.410> then<00:04:16.620> you'll<00:04:16.769> be<00:04:16.890> able<00:04:16.979> to

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
certain things then you'll be able to

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.610 
certain things then you'll be able to
notice<00:04:17.609> but<00:04:18.180> other<00:04:18.510> than<00:04:18.780> that<00:04:18.840> I<00:04:19.080> mean<00:04:19.350> you

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
notice but other than that I mean you

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.800 
notice but other than that I mean you
can't<00:04:19.979> really<00:04:20.220> tell<00:04:20.580> so<00:04:21.180> that's<00:04:21.359> actually<00:04:21.510> why

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
can't really tell so that's actually why

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.779 
can't really tell so that's actually why
I<00:04:21.840> like<00:04:22.020> deep<00:04:22.260> and<00:04:22.470> better<00:04:22.740> however<00:04:23.099> if<00:04:23.580> you

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
I like deep and better however if you

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:24.740 
I like deep and better however if you
don't<00:04:24.120> have<00:04:24.360> a<00:04:24.390> knife

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
don't have a knife

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.620 
don't have a knife
for<00:04:25.080> ipod<00:04:25.500> touch<00:04:25.740> 4th<00:04:26.070> generation<00:04:26.370> then<00:04:27.330> you

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
for ipod touch 4th generation then you

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.930 
for ipod touch 4th generation then you
definitely<00:04:28.230> want<00:04:28.620> to<00:04:28.710> look<00:04:28.770> into<00:04:29.220> getting<00:04:29.340> 3d

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
definitely want to look into getting 3d

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
going to go ahead and get up close to an

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.390

don't<00:04:41.730> like<00:04:41.850> this<00:04:42.270> tweak<00:04:42.630> on<00:04:42.840> the<00:04:42.930> iPad<00:04:43.410> I

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
don't like this tweak on the iPad I

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.530 
don't like this tweak on the iPad I
don't<00:04:44.040> think<00:04:44.220> it<00:04:44.340> works<00:04:44.610> right<00:04:44.970> and<00:04:45.300> it

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
don't think it works right and it

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.260 
don't think it works right and it
definitely<00:04:45.780> jitters<00:04:46.410> way<00:04:46.800> way<00:04:47.190> too<00:04:47.220> much<00:04:47.730> so

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
definitely jitters way way too much so

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.820 
definitely jitters way way too much so
I'm<00:04:48.360> going<00:04:48.570> to<00:04:48.600> try<00:04:48.870> and<00:04:48.930> keep<00:04:49.140> my<00:04:49.200> iPad<00:04:49.680> as

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
I'm going to try and keep my iPad as

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.100 
I'm going to try and keep my iPad as
still<00:04:50.070> as<00:04:50.100> possible<00:04:50.250> and<00:04:50.970> just<00:04:51.630> show<00:04:51.840> you<00:04:51.900> guys

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
still as possible and just show you guys

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.500 
still as possible and just show you guys
how<00:04:52.170> the<00:04:52.470> background<00:04:53.100> jitters<00:04:53.580> and<00:04:53.760> I<00:04:54.300> don't

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
how the background jitters and I don't

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.720 
how the background jitters and I don't
even<00:04:54.600> have<00:04:54.810> the<00:04:54.840> depth<00:04:55.200> turned<00:04:55.650> up<00:04:55.920> as<00:04:56.100> you<00:04:56.580> can

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
even have the depth turned up as you can

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:57.980 
even have the depth turned up as you can
see<00:04:57.000> i'm<00:04:57.210> just<00:04:57.480> going<00:04:57.600> to<00:04:57.630> go<00:04:57.690> into<00:04:57.840> the

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
see i'm just going to go into the

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.540 
see i'm just going to go into the
settings<00:04:58.200> app<00:04:58.530> and<00:04:58.830> i<00:04:59.040> don't<00:04:59.220> even<00:04:59.310> have<00:04:59.430> the

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
settings app and i don't even have the

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.430 
settings app and i don't even have the
depth<00:04:59.850> turned<00:05:00.180> up<00:05:00.360> all<00:05:00.540> the<00:05:00.690> way<00:05:00.780> when<00:05:01.290> I<00:05:01.320> do

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
depth turned up all the way when I do

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.350 
depth turned up all the way when I do
turn<00:05:01.950> it<00:05:02.130> up<00:05:02.250> all<00:05:02.400> the<00:05:02.430> way<00:05:02.550> it's<00:05:02.760> just<00:05:03.030> crazy

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
turn it up all the way it's just crazy

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.330 
turn it up all the way it's just crazy
like<00:05:03.540> that<00:05:03.720> I'm<00:05:04.140> not<00:05:04.590> even<00:05:04.830> really<00:05:04.860> doing

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
like that I'm not even really doing

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.250 
like that I'm not even really doing
anything<00:05:05.550> and<00:05:06.000> it's<00:05:06.180> jittering<00:05:06.690> basically

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
anything and it's jittering basically

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.120 
anything and it's jittering basically
out<00:05:07.470> of<00:05:07.500> control<00:05:08.190> so<00:05:08.850> i<00:05:09.630> don't<00:05:10.470> really<00:05:10.770> like<00:05:10.860> it

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
out of control so i don't really like it

for the ipad and i don't recommend it

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.950 
for the ipad and i don't recommend it
however<00:05:13.740> it<00:05:14.010> can<00:05:14.370> be<00:05:14.610> kind<00:05:14.970> of<00:05:15.120> cool<00:05:15.360> if<00:05:15.570> you

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
however it can be kind of cool if you

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.040 
however it can be kind of cool if you
get<00:05:16.140> exactly<00:05:16.350> the<00:05:17.040> right<00:05:17.220> wallpaper<00:05:17.550> so<00:05:18.540> i'm

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
get exactly the right wallpaper so i'm

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.600 
get exactly the right wallpaper so i'm
going<00:05:19.200> to<00:05:19.410> demonstrate<00:05:19.590> it<00:05:20.070> with<00:05:20.160> a<00:05:20.190> wallpaper

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
going to demonstrate it with a wallpaper

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.970 
going to demonstrate it with a wallpaper
that<00:05:20.820> I<00:05:20.880> think<00:05:21.150> works<00:05:21.270> really<00:05:21.450> well<00:05:21.870> so<00:05:22.770> I<00:05:22.800> have

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
that I think works really well so I have

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.100 
that I think works really well so I have
the<00:05:23.130> depth<00:05:23.400> turned<00:05:23.790> almost<00:05:24.030> all<00:05:24.360> the<00:05:24.720> way<00:05:24.750> down

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
the depth turned almost all the way down

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.070 
the depth turned almost all the way down
and<00:05:25.410> I<00:05:26.040> have<00:05:26.250> this<00:05:26.460> earth<00:05:26.730> wallpaper<00:05:27.419> set<00:05:27.870> and

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
and I have this earth wallpaper set and

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.219 
and I have this earth wallpaper set and
I<00:05:28.770> really<00:05:29.310> like<00:05:29.520> it<00:05:29.760> on<00:05:30.210> this<00:05:30.510> one<00:05:30.780> it<00:05:30.960> still

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:31.229 
I really like it on this one it still

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:33.440 
I really like it on this one it still
kind<00:05:31.530> of<00:05:31.590> does<00:05:31.800> that<00:05:31.830> jittery<00:05:32.460> thing<00:05:32.820> but

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
kind of does that jittery thing but

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.600 
kind of does that jittery thing but
other<00:05:33.780> than<00:05:34.020> that<00:05:34.110> it<00:05:34.470> looks<00:05:34.500> really<00:05:35.070> nice<00:05:35.340> on

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
other than that it looks really nice on

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.540 
other than that it looks really nice on
this<00:05:35.760> earth<00:05:36.030> wallpaper<00:05:36.720> but<00:05:37.410> I<00:05:37.800> would<00:05:38.220> really

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
this earth wallpaper but I would really

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.790 
this earth wallpaper but I would really
recommend<00:05:38.790> getting<00:05:39.360> it<00:05:39.660> on<00:05:39.840> like<00:05:40.290> an<00:05:40.440> iPhone

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
recommend getting it on like an iPhone

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.240 
recommend getting it on like an iPhone
or<00:05:40.830> an<00:05:40.979> iPod<00:05:41.370> Touch<00:05:41.669> as<00:05:41.910> opposed<00:05:42.210> to<00:05:42.390> an<00:05:42.479> iPad

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
or an iPod Touch as opposed to an iPad

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.469 
or an iPod Touch as opposed to an iPad
hopefully<00:05:44.250> the<00:05:44.400> developers<00:05:44.880> can<00:05:45.120> end<00:05:45.330> up

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 
hopefully the developers can end up

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:47.870 
hopefully the developers can end up
getting<00:05:45.810> it<00:05:45.900> worked<00:05:46.140> out<00:05:46.410> and<00:05:46.680> they<00:05:47.370> can<00:05:47.580> fix

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 
getting it worked out and they can fix

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.320 
getting it worked out and they can fix
