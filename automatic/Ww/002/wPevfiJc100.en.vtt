00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 Hi, people, welcome to a last video of 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.610
 veda I do not know what my reaction I'm 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.639
 happy and do not be a little sad in 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.040
 truth not so sad but the tour 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.900
 I do not know, I 'm thinking, I'm very happy. 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.270
 I did not come back so much work 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.310
 big because it gave a huge job 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.689
 People you have no idea I'm very 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.910
 tired April was such a tragic month 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.090
 Because everything happened in April, I 'm 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.690
 glad that I got it and arrived at 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.840
 video number 31 obvious I was late many 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.570
 videos but I can publish all 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.700
 the videos and I hope it has 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.070
 actually left on the 30th will not 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.090
 do not go out on the 1st day at least do not lose 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.890
 the month of April 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.500
 I'm very happy with the reception that goes 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.079
 You hugged me so it's cause and me. 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.840
 they called very very very very much 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.360
 It is undoubtedly if you did not have a 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.789
 pane is missing the video is gone 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.070
 publish the video or not then if you 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.049
 had not been so warm so 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.170
 Looking forward to the next videos maybe 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.270
 it would not be another thing I would not record 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.450
 I think I'd be discouraged, I know I might not 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.460
 conclude the challenge do not know but 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.549
 your style was fundamental to 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.799
 come in the last video and it's amazing 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.670
 support received during these 30 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.470
 days 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.200
 There was no one saying you're not going. 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.740
 not get or criticize the channel 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.549
 during these 30 days then you know was 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:36.060
 very perfect so the reception and how 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.220
 You liked everything and praised and 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.479
 gave legal suggestions and were 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.920
 excited 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.200
 I know that in the final stretch I had 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.970
 thought of several types of videos only 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.079
 I could not record several more videos 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.210
 elaborated 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.700
 I had thought of making more reviews 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.970
 to make more videos like that to talk about 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.420
 more complex and more important things 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.399
 It just ended up that I needed to record 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.159
 a video and I would not have time had not 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.140
 head to be developing a lot 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.810
 so I could not record then I 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.149
 I recorded more tag so the team 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.860
 days but if you were supporting me and 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.310
 happy with twice the views 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.770
 It was great great great too 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.280
 the very channel I think was 45 thousand 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:22.430
 registered during the ban, so there is a lot 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.930
 Thank you, we passed 35 thousand and 35 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.730
 one thousand subscribers 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.019
 And there you are, very happy and the 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.200
 plans that I have to continue the 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:35.090
 channel is that I intend to release about 2 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.180
 times a week from now 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.190
 Good to have is conversation, I learned that I 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.910
 I can record these videos 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:46.430
 sometimes not so out swimmingly the 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.500
 old was every day so it was a burden 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.480
 huge of videos per week 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.880
 but I think I can handle it 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.390
 two videos a week so I'll go 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:59.510
 make it happen and the other 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.819
 news is that the channel will join with 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.190
 the staff is I can not give 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.410
 account of another channel and even because 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.569
 my audience is on this channel is not on 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.579
 other foot the content I would do there myself 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.920
 I'll do it on the caratatiua channel like this. 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:14.660
 as the blog will also aggregate the others 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.450
 the contents I wanted to record is 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.760
 posted the staff that I ended up too 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.950
 No, there's no more the globe, the folks to 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.700
 those who already visit know that they are out of 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.650
 air 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.980
 So I kept the domain because I want to 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.209
 leave the name reserved but I will not 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:33.470
 keep posting because I do not have 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:36.709
 how to deal with two things that 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.769
 could then be together in the channel in the 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:42.049
 blog will be added content that 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.359
 I was going to put there in the personal channel of the blog 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.319
 It's up to me and I'm going to leave both 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:47.209
 open 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.430
 I'm glad that in the personal blog I did not have 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.799
 just have a video I think the 25 speaks 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.690
 about me but all the videos that already 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:56.150
 had thought of publishing will apply 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.799
 here in the Haitian boy and you will receive 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.780
 this kind of videos 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:02.209
 probably in the near future. 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.280
 Once a week, Japan will have a 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:07.790
 other content but the content of books 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:10.970
 You can leave it here and it 's 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:15.860
 just to continue with the frequency with 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:18.230
 differentiated subjects maybe another 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.959
 not interested 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:23.720
 books actually come to the channel and 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:26.000
 know the books and then I have a 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.970
 another approach to winning readers 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.920
 of new books readers do 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.980
 people like books because 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:37.190
 Maybe she does not come here to find 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.360
 books and and they end up knowing proof 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.550
 in other videos 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.670
 I have to think that more this goal 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.890
 now after the old because I know that 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:50.450
 many people knew the channel during the 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:52.490
 prohibition is by indication or by chance and 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.360
 said he started reading because of the 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.610
 channel 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.350
 the moment the number of readings for cause 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.650
 of the channel so I was very very happy 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:03.470
 and I think I have a certain mission 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.940
 now then I'll try to do this and 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.790
 You will see other subjects here. 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.130
 maybe a little more personal but I'm going 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:13.130
 try not obviously the channel goes 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.050
 keep being about books but I'm going 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:18.140
 try to post so less once per 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:20.720
 week or every 15 days other subjects 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:23.270
 I hope you like it, hope you do not 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.400
 it is very bad but you can leave it at 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:28.100
 least once a week will have 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.020
 about books then 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.570
 keep up the good here 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.460
 how was it very very very much? 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.650
 thank you everyone for the campaign 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:39.740
