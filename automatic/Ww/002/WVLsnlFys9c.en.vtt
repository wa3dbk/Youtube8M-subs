we have come inside the greenhouse here

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:27.479 
we have come inside the greenhouse here
at<00:00:26.230> pan-american<00:00:26.410> seed<00:00:27.009> and<00:00:27.189> we're<00:00:27.279> looking

00:00:27.479 --> 00:00:27.489 
at pan-american seed and we're looking

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:29.220 
at pan-american seed and we're looking
at<00:00:27.579> some<00:00:27.699> ball<00:00:27.880> flora<00:00:28.179> plant<00:00:28.509> geraniums

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
at some ball flora plant geraniums

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.389 
at some ball flora plant geraniums
they've<00:00:29.470> put<00:00:29.619> a<00:00:29.649> lot<00:00:29.800> of<00:00:29.890> emphasis<00:00:30.039> on

00:00:30.389 --> 00:00:30.399 
they've put a lot of emphasis on

they've put a lot of emphasis on
geraniums<00:00:30.910> this<00:00:31.480> year<00:00:31.779> and<00:00:31.899> the<00:00:31.960> first<00:00:32.110> one

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:32.379 
geraniums this year and the first one

geraniums this year and the first one
that<00:00:32.760> lovely<00:00:33.760> videographer<00:00:34.210> Jen<00:00:34.420> was<00:00:34.629> focused

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:35.019 
that lovely videographer Jen was focused

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:38.549 
that lovely videographer Jen was focused
on<00:00:35.140> is<00:00:35.350> called<00:00:35.530> Fantasia<00:00:36.070> dark<00:00:37.030> red<00:00:37.420> and<00:00:37.780> they

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 
on is called Fantasia dark red and they

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:40.259 
on is called Fantasia dark red and they
are<00:00:38.680> positioning<00:00:39.159> this<00:00:39.280> directly<00:00:39.699> against

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:40.269 
are positioning this directly against

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:43.560 
are positioning this directly against
Calliope<00:00:41.430> going<00:00:42.430> for<00:00:42.579> that<00:00:42.640> true<00:00:43.000> deep<00:00:43.300> red

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
Calliope going for that true deep red

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.090 
Calliope going for that true deep red
color<00:00:43.839> the<00:00:43.989> difference<00:00:44.260> being<00:00:44.440> this<00:00:44.680> is<00:00:44.860> on<00:00:44.979> an

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
color the difference being this is on an

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.579 
color the difference being this is on an
actual<00:00:45.370> zonal<00:00:45.940> geranium<00:00:46.449> not<00:00:46.930> any<00:00:47.110> kind<00:00:47.290> of<00:00:47.440> a

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:47.589 
actual zonal geranium not any kind of a

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:52.469 
actual zonal geranium not any kind of a
cross<00:00:48.070> or<00:00:48.309> a<00:00:49.589> mix<00:00:50.589> and<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.850> that's<00:00:52.059> a<00:00:52.269> new

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:52.479 
cross or a mix and so that's a new

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:55.169 
cross or a mix and so that's a new
addition<00:00:52.899> to<00:00:52.930> the<00:00:53.110> Fantasia<00:00:53.820> series<00:00:54.820> and

is an Ivy geranium series 14 colors this
is<00:01:02.890> called<00:01:03.070> precision<00:01:03.789> and<00:01:04.679> this<00:01:05.679> one<00:01:05.860> is

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.009 
is called precision and this one is

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:08.490 
is called precision and this one is
actually<00:01:06.310> replacing<00:01:06.700> the<00:01:06.970> color<00:01:07.210> Cade<00:01:07.509> series

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500

actually replacing the color Cade series
of<00:01:08.920> Ivy<00:01:09.250> geraniums<00:01:09.759> and<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:11.140> has<00:01:11.320> been

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
of Ivy geraniums and it has been

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.590 
of Ivy geraniums and it has been
selected<00:01:12.160> as<00:01:12.580> it<00:01:12.759> should<00:01:12.909> have<00:01:13.030> been<00:01:13.149> for

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
selected as it should have been for

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.840 
selected as it should have been for
edema<00:01:14.320> resistance<00:01:14.890> it's<00:01:15.039> a<00:01:15.100> true<00:01:15.340> Ivy<00:01:15.700> it's

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
edema resistance it's a true Ivy it's

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.830 
edema resistance it's a true Ivy it's
not<00:01:16.030> a<00:01:16.060> across<00:01:16.960> and<00:01:17.440> it's<00:01:17.950> precise<00:01:18.490> and<00:01:19.390> it's

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
not a across and it's precise and it's

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.380 
not a across and it's precise and it's
habit<00:01:20.259> in<00:01:20.440> flowering<00:01:20.830> time<00:01:21.100> hence<00:01:21.880> the<00:01:22.030> name<00:01:22.179> I

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
habit in flowering time hence the name I

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.910 
habit in flowering time hence the name I
reckon<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:24.490> in<00:01:25.149> a<00:01:25.270> in<00:01:25.540> a<00:01:25.630> compact<00:01:26.200> series<00:01:26.710> that

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.600 
flush most geraniums sent up one or two
flowers<00:01:40.899> that's<00:01:41.439> okay<00:01:41.829> but<00:01:42.070> if<00:01:42.130> I<00:01:42.189> only<00:01:42.280> set<00:01:42.490> up
