00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:15.709
 but I think it was certainly one 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:21.289
 game however conditioned by episodes 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:24.070
 very very serious not because of the rigor 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:28.429
 given to the rigor not given life to the 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:30.439
 expulsion that now they told me that 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.699
 was given for clear opportunity by 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:36.140
 network with one last man 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:38.420
 I am certainly a little astonished 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.899
 cannot be astonished by this type of 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.850
 However, I also say that I am 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.399
 decisions the referee issue make 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.430
 part of the football can be a 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.230
 times in favor may be against it 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.989
 we certainly accept a defeat 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:57.140
 this is painful because it brings us the 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:00.949
 But the way in the Champions uphill say 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.660
 also that this game made us 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:06.140
 also understand in 10 against 11 that if 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.689
 we want we can draw very large 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.170
 physical and nervous energies of 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:14.420
 technical tactical organization of desire 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.079
 to prove that these stages 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:21.009
 however they belong to us and that there 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:23.940
 we can stand but with 7 points 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:27.670
 it seems to me 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.680
 stage in June 7 points but this is it 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.260
 I don't know this because it is a repeat not 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.690
 it is in our conception to think of 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.790
 take the field to equalize one 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.400
 game we also did here today at 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.380
 bernabeu against the real madrid us 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.170
 we tried to play the game 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.030
 trying to get the win then 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.680
 in the next three games for sure 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.380
 we will never go into the field with 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.930
 the goal of thinking about equalizing one 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.360
 game that we would always like to win 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.150
 start I think the team today 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.630
 has shown I repeat in the presence of 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.950
 a great team certainly one 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.880
 team built to win the 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:09.660
 champions of being able to have their say and 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.830
 can certainly deserve 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.890
 definitely a positive result a 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.739
 despite the final outcome but I have 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.250
 always said that this is a team 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:24.940
 than for the men he has available 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.780
 can dress two types of situations 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.410
 game 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:34.269
 at 35 23 34 as we want to call it o 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:36.870
 a 4x3 is inevitable when 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:40.049
 we did it 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.790
 the first year there was pepper on the right 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:45.130
 today we have put on marchisio which is a 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.620
 player who can do this kind of 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.510
 role can be adapted does not have the 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.980
 pepper characteristics, however, others 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.380
 features can be 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.220
 interesting to develop this game 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:59.910
 however when 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.280
 we have done since Monday with 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.230
 resistance certain movements we have 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.700
 prepared the match with this type of 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:13.130
 module was very easy for i 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.130
 guys find themselves in some movements 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.480
 in europe when you meet teams with 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.460
 so effective exterior so strong 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:25.110
 in one against one 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:31.650
 devastating in the spaces certainly 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:33.000
 It is also important to try to adapt 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.040
 a bit to the opponent in the phase 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.450
 defensive in the offensive phase yes 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.770
 try to do your own things e 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.630
 we did it also today because 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.070
 we played with personality 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.120
 I think with an excellent organization of 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:50.940
 game with interesting textures but 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:54.030
 honestly today I do not leave the Bernabeu 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.280
 with great concern as well as not 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.050
 I was worried after Florence because 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.250
 le after florence 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.050
 I repeat you did for 70 games 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.320
 dominated the long and wide game 15 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:06.690
 minutes of blackouts cannot 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.110
 delete anyway what this one 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.650
 team expresses what they often do today 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.650
 there is that 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:21.220
 in madrid there is that which can get there 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:22.690
 defeat maybe today was not going to 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.750
 what we have demonstrated for that 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.699
 that we did that I think the 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.259
 the team's performance today has been 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:33.550
 good performance we go out 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:35.500
 certainly with the belief that up 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:40.330
 these stages if we want to 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:43.389
 we can feel good just by demonstrating 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:46.210
 I repeat that I can still draw so much 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:47.620
 of physical and nervous energies and of 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.080
 mentality of technical organization 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.960
 tactical thing that maybe someone put 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.360
 can doubt 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.699
 let's say he was helped too 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.759
 a little help here to decide the game 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:05.009
 because I repeat they are two episodes anyway 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:07.419
 that leave a little bit of perplexity 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:09.669
 anyway then and we are talking about 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:11.770
 a great champion as a Christian 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:14.500
 ronaldo that I think we have today 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.240
 limited in an important way 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.740
 by virtue also of a preparation of the 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.009
 game in the right way because 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:24.610
 this is a team that leaves you 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:27.190
 field players like ronaldo as of 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:30.159
 maria as bale when entered as 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:32.320
 benzema can really disintegrate 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:33.940
 instead today we have been a lot 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.199
 good very compact in the phase of 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.710
 start the offensive phase they have 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:40.060
 created different difficulties because it is not 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.210
 easy to come and play at the bernabeu 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.139
 instead we have shown personality 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.479
 the organization we did 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:48.729
 definitely a good game 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:50.349
 there is a disappointment surely there is the 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:53.169
 disappointment because the journey in champions 

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:55.509
 it's uphill but there is also the 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:58.120
 awareness that it is all in ours 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:59.979
 hands and if we want we can 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:03.240
 continue we can also also 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:03.240
 do important things this year
