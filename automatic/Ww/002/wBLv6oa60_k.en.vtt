00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:03.379 

in<00:00:01.439> the<00:00:01.920> previous<00:00:02.129> tutorial<00:00:02.550> we<00:00:03.090> took<00:00:03.179> a<00:00:03.240> look

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
in the previous tutorial we took a look

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.480 
in the previous tutorial we took a look
at<00:00:03.540> scaling<00:00:04.080> your<00:00:04.380> object<00:00:04.830> using<00:00:05.040> the<00:00:05.279> bones

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
at scaling your object using the bones

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.670 
at scaling your object using the bones
like<00:00:05.850> for<00:00:06.150> instance<00:00:06.210> i<00:00:06.660> right<00:00:06.960> click<00:00:07.230> here<00:00:07.560> in

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
like for instance i right click here in

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.910 
like for instance i right click here in
pose<00:00:08.010> mode<00:00:08.040> i<00:00:08.610> press<00:00:09.090> s<00:00:09.360> and<00:00:09.660> I'm<00:00:10.230> scaling<00:00:10.650> the

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
pose mode i press s and I'm scaling the

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.249 
pose mode i press s and I'm scaling the
bone<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.429> scales<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.360> shape<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:12.719> my<00:00:12.750> object

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
bone and scales the shape of my object

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.440 
bone and scales the shape of my object
okay<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:13.980> you<00:00:14.280> can<00:00:14.400> do<00:00:14.490> it<00:00:14.580> along<00:00:14.790> any<00:00:15.030> local

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
okay and you can do it along any local

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.450 
okay and you can do it along any local
access<00:00:15.809> that<00:00:15.960> you<00:00:16.049> want<00:00:16.320> or<00:00:16.470> exclude<00:00:16.920> any

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
access that you want or exclude any

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.550 
access that you want or exclude any
local<00:00:17.850> axes<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.359> that<00:00:18.869> works<00:00:19.080> whether<00:00:19.350> you're

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
local axes and that works whether you're

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.859 
local axes and that works whether you're
in<00:00:19.710> notice<00:00:20.670> I'm<00:00:20.820> up<00:00:20.970> here<00:00:21.119> in<00:00:21.240> armature<00:00:21.689> mode

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
in notice I'm up here in armature mode

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.810 
in notice I'm up here in armature mode
for<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.199> object<00:00:22.350> data<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.519> have<00:00:23.670> this

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
for the object data and I have this

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.490 
for the object data and I have this
octahedron<00:00:24.359> shape<00:00:24.570> well<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:24.840> could<00:00:25.080> also<00:00:25.199> use<00:00:25.320> a

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
octahedron shape well I could also use a

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.410 
octahedron shape well I could also use a
stick<00:00:25.920> shape<00:00:26.130> maybe<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.580> just<00:00:26.820> prefer<00:00:27.000> that

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
stick shape maybe I just prefer that

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.859 
stick shape maybe I just prefer that
shape<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.050> press<00:00:28.289> s<00:00:28.560> works<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.340> same<00:00:29.369> way

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
shape and I press s works the same way

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.740 
shape and I press s works the same way
or<00:00:30.869> if<00:00:31.019> I'm<00:00:31.140> in<00:00:31.349> be<00:00:31.560> bone<00:00:31.740> shape<00:00:32.329> process<00:00:33.329> works

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
or if I'm in be bone shape process works

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.229 
or if I'm in be bone shape process works
the<00:00:33.960> same<00:00:33.989> way<00:00:34.170> like<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:35.040> or<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.309> press<00:00:35.640> G<00:00:35.940> and

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
the same way like that or I press G and

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.760 
the same way like that or I press G and
I<00:00:36.510> can<00:00:36.660> move<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.899> around<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.469> they're<00:00:37.590> just

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
I can move it around so they're just

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.860 
I can move it around so they're just
different<00:00:37.950> ways<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.820> look<00:00:39.090> at<00:00:39.210> bones<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.600> happen

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
different ways to look at bones I happen

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.540 
different ways to look at bones I happen
to<00:00:39.899> like<00:00:40.110> looking<00:00:40.500> at<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.710> octahedron<00:00:41.340> bone

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
to like looking at the octahedron bone

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.630 
to like looking at the octahedron bone
like<00:00:42.300> this<00:00:42.600> but<00:00:43.079> now<00:00:43.200> there's<00:00:43.379> another<00:00:43.579> way<00:00:44.579> to

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
like this but now there's another way to

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.740 
like this but now there's another way to
display<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.300> that's<00:00:45.480> through<00:00:45.660> the

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
display it and that's through the

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.740 
display it and that's through the
envelope<00:00:46.170> now<00:00:46.829> what<00:00:47.039> we<00:00:47.190> normally<00:00:47.750> parent

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
envelope now what we normally parent

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.990 
envelope now what we normally parent
things<00:00:49.140> when<00:00:49.739> I've<00:00:49.890> worked<00:00:50.340> in<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.700> previous

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
things when I've worked in the previous

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.910 
things when I've worked in the previous
lessons<00:00:51.449> which<00:00:51.629> were<00:00:51.809> introductory<00:00:52.440> lessons

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
lessons which were introductory lessons

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.619 
lessons which were introductory lessons
I<00:00:53.039> normally<00:00:53.460> take<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.760> object<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.300> parent

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
I normally take the object that I parent

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.420 
I normally take the object that I parent
it<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.960> armature<00:00:55.379> how<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.829> use<00:00:55.980> automatic

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
it to the armature how to use automatic

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.689 
it to the armature how to use automatic
weights<00:00:56.820> alright<00:00:57.539> so<00:00:58.020> waiting<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:59.430> notice

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
weights alright so waiting is you notice

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.700 
weights alright so waiting is you notice
what<00:00:59.850> happens<00:00:59.940> when<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.329> change<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.379> also

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
what happens when I change it I also

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.609 
what happens when I change it I also
have<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.449> little<00:01:03.449> elliptical<00:01:04.110> shape<00:01:04.409> in

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
have this little elliptical shape in

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.660 
have this little elliptical shape in
here<00:01:04.949> like<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.939> that's<00:01:07.100> basically<00:01:08.100> the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
here like this and that's basically the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.410 
here like this and that's basically the
weight<00:01:09.290> that<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.530> bone<00:01:11.100> has<00:01:11.430> influenced<00:01:12.210> wise

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
weight that the bone has influenced wise

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.530 
weight that the bone has influenced wise
on<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.900> object<00:01:13.049> so<00:01:13.770> let's<00:01:14.040> go<00:01:14.159> back<00:01:14.490> from<00:01:15.150> here

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
on the object so let's go back from here

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.780 
on the object so let's go back from here
let's<00:01:16.229> go<00:01:16.350> into<00:01:16.650> edit<00:01:16.799> mode<00:01:17.159> because<00:01:17.549> we're

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
let's go into edit mode because we're

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.130 
let's go into edit mode because we're
going<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.210> work<00:01:18.360> with<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:18.689> in<00:01:18.869> edit<00:01:19.110> mode

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
going to work with this in edit mode

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.219 
going to work with this in edit mode
instead<00:01:19.580> so<00:01:20.580> now<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:21.030> here<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.689> can<00:01:21.930> still

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
instead so now in here I can still

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.920 
instead so now in here I can still
change<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:23.369> shape<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:23.970> bone<00:01:24.390> in<00:01:24.630> here<00:01:24.840> if

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
change the shape of the bone in here if

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.980 
change the shape of the bone in here if
I<00:01:25.020> press<00:01:25.350> s<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:26.220> can<00:01:26.970> change<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.450> shape<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:27.960> the

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
I press s I can change the shape of the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.620 
I press s I can change the shape of the
bone<00:01:28.259> but<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:28.950> doesn't<00:01:29.340> change<00:01:29.579> its<00:01:30.299> not

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
bone but it doesn't change its not

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.109 
bone but it doesn't change its not
changing<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.140> influence<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:32.070> it's<00:01:32.939> not

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
changing the influence of it's not

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.690 
changing the influence of it's not
changing<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.900> mesh<00:01:34.409> what<00:01:35.100> I'm<00:01:35.220> doing<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.579> in

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
changing the mesh what I'm doing it in

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.859 
changing the mesh what I'm doing it in
here<00:01:35.970> I'm<00:01:36.270> in<00:01:36.509> edit<00:01:36.900> mode<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:37.140> only<00:01:37.290> works<00:01:37.530> in

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
here I'm in edit mode that only works in

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.380 
here I'm in edit mode that only works in
impose<00:01:39.869> mode<00:01:40.579> but<00:01:41.579> notice<00:01:41.850> if<00:01:41.970> I'm<00:01:42.210> going<00:01:42.299> to

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
impose mode but notice if I'm going to

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.230 
impose mode but notice if I'm going to
press<00:01:42.570> s<00:01:42.750> again<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.670> it's<00:01:44.670> changing<00:01:45.119> the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
press s again and it's changing the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.999 
press s again and it's changing the
shape<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.600> bone<00:01:45.840> but<00:01:46.049> notice<00:01:46.740> the

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
shape of the bone but notice the

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.910 
shape of the bone but notice the
influence<00:01:47.729> all<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.899> way<00:01:49.020> around<00:01:49.140> here<00:01:49.740> is

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
influence all the way around here is

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.289 
influence all the way around here is
also<00:01:50.369> changing<00:01:50.670> inch<00:01:51.030> in<00:01:51.360> size<00:01:52.579> alright<00:01:53.579> so<00:01:54.060> in

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
also changing inch in size alright so in

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.700 
also changing inch in size alright so in
some<00:01:54.479> cases<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:54.869> want<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.140> change<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.530> shape

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
some cases you want to change the shape

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.319 
some cases you want to change the shape
of<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:55.920> bone<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.640> some<00:01:56.790> cases<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.149> want

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
of the bone and in some cases you want

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.109 
of the bone and in some cases you want
to<00:01:57.390> change<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:58.200> influence<00:01:58.770> like<00:01:59.340> that<00:01:59.520> now<00:01:59.939> in

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
to change the influence like that now in

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.690 
to change the influence like that now in
also<00:02:01.110> in<00:02:01.259> here<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.439> could<00:02:01.680> also<00:02:01.829> select<00:02:02.189> the

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
also in here I could also select the

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.060 
also in here I could also select the
individual<00:02:03.270> bone<00:02:03.540> ends<00:02:03.780> like<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:04.860> i<00:02:04.890> can

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
individual bone ends like that and i can

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.969 
individual bone ends like that and i can
press<00:02:05.250> s<00:02:05.520> here<00:02:05.820> i<00:02:06.149> can<00:02:07.020> scale<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.829> can

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
press s here i can scale that you can

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.710 
press s here i can scale that you can
see<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.310> adjacent<00:02:08.849> bones<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.300> are<00:02:09.360> attached

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
see the adjacent bones that are attached

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.280 
see the adjacent bones that are attached
or<00:02:09.989> also<00:02:10.259> scaling<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:10.830> also<00:02:11.459> that<00:02:11.870> influence

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
or also scaling and also that influence

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.819 
or also scaling and also that influence
is<00:02:13.379> changing<00:02:14.069> as<00:02:14.189> well<00:02:14.430> so<00:02:15.150> that's<00:02:15.299> one<00:02:15.840> one

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:16.829 
is changing as well so that's one one

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:18.649 
is changing as well so that's one one
way<00:02:17.010> to<00:02:17.040> change<00:02:17.370> it<00:02:17.609> so<00:02:17.790> you<00:02:17.849> there<00:02:18.480> you're

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659 
way to change it so you there you're

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.809 
way to change it so you there you're
changing<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.230> scaling<00:02:19.829> of<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.129> bone<00:02:20.310> and

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
changing the scaling of the bone and

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.179 
changing the scaling of the bone and
you're<00:02:21.030> changing<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:21.599> influence<00:02:22.379> of<00:02:22.560> the

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:23.189 
you're changing the influence of the

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:27.140 
you're changing the influence of the
bone<00:02:23.400> on<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:23.790> shape<00:02:24.569> and<00:02:25.290> now<00:02:25.469> the<00:02:26.250> other<00:02:26.459> way

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
bone on the shape and now the other way

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.690 
bone on the shape and now the other way
to<00:02:27.209> do<00:02:27.390> it<00:02:27.510> is<00:02:27.599> you<00:02:27.659> also<00:02:27.959> press<00:02:28.260> ctrl<00:02:28.980> alt<00:02:29.219> s

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
to do it is you also press ctrl alt s

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.530 
to do it is you also press ctrl alt s
instead<00:02:30.299> of<00:02:30.420> just<00:02:30.599> as<00:02:30.810> so<00:02:31.019> ctrl<00:02:31.439> alt<00:02:31.709> and<00:02:32.250> s<00:02:32.939> and

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
instead of just as so ctrl alt and s and

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.020 
instead of just as so ctrl alt and s and
then<00:02:34.230> when<00:02:34.379> I<00:02:34.409> move<00:02:35.189> it<00:02:35.370> two<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:35.790> get<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:36.180> ctrl<00:02:36.870> s

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
then when I move it two to get it ctrl s

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.890 
then when I move it two to get it ctrl s
maybe<00:02:39.030> I<00:02:39.090> didn't<00:02:39.329> get<00:02:39.480> in<00:02:39.599> there<00:02:39.720> all<00:02:39.870> right

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
maybe I didn't get in there all right

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.039 
maybe I didn't get in there all right
let's<00:02:40.079> get<00:02:40.170> this<00:02:40.319> bone<00:02:40.579> ctrl<00:02:41.579> alt<00:02:41.819> s<00:02:42.060> alright

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
let's get this bone ctrl alt s alright

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.839 
let's get this bone ctrl alt s alright
there<00:02:43.290> we<00:02:43.319> go<00:02:43.500> so<00:02:43.920> have<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.159> whole<00:02:44.340> bone<00:02:44.549> and

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
there we go so have the whole bone and

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:46.990 
there we go so have the whole bone and
then<00:02:45.420> when<00:02:45.810> i<00:02:45.840> move<00:02:46.049> it<00:02:46.200> i'm<00:02:46.349> changing<00:02:46.859> the

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
then when i move it i'm changing the

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.500 
then when i move it i'm changing the
influence<00:02:48.000> only<00:02:49.010> like<00:02:50.010> this<00:02:50.280> all<00:02:50.700> right<00:02:50.939> so

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
influence only like this all right so

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.360 
influence only like this all right so
what<00:02:52.049> I<00:02:52.079> like<00:02:52.319> to<00:02:52.349> do<00:02:52.500> is<00:02:52.530> try<00:02:52.799> and<00:02:52.889> match<00:02:53.129> my

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
what I like to do is try and match my

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.210 
what I like to do is try and match my
influence<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.299> the<00:02:54.810> object<00:02:55.200> that<00:02:55.859> I'm<00:02:55.980> working

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
influence to the object that I'm working

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.039 
influence to the object that I'm working
with<00:02:56.400> so<00:02:56.700> I<00:02:56.760> would<00:02:57.180> come<00:02:57.329> up<00:02:57.450> here<00:02:57.629> like<00:02:57.840> this

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
with so I would come up here like this

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.899 
with so I would come up here like this
and<00:02:58.109> drop<00:02:59.040> this<00:02:59.250> down<00:02:59.310> in<00:03:00.139> present<00:03:01.139> s<00:03:01.609> and<00:03:02.609> I

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
and drop this down in present s and I

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:05.449 
and drop this down in present s and I
would<00:03:03.060> shrink<00:03:03.480> this<00:03:03.689> bone<00:03:03.989> down<00:03:04.319> to<00:03:05.189> more

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
would shrink this bone down to more

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.960 
would shrink this bone down to more
accurately<00:03:05.970> match<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:08.220> shape<00:03:08.370> of<00:03:08.549> my<00:03:08.669> object

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
accurately match the shape of my object

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.089 
accurately match the shape of my object
if<00:03:11.970> you<00:03:12.120> like<00:03:12.299> that<00:03:12.720> even<00:03:12.959> it<00:03:13.260> just<00:03:13.680> depends<00:03:13.919> on

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
if you like that even it just depends on

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.610 
if you like that even it just depends on
how<00:03:14.819> you<00:03:14.849> want<00:03:15.030> it<00:03:15.359> a<00:03:15.599> lot<00:03:15.900> of<00:03:16.019> this<00:03:16.109> comes<00:03:16.349> down

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
how you want it a lot of this comes down

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.729 
how you want it a lot of this comes down
to<00:03:16.950> how<00:03:17.940> you<00:03:18.000> want<00:03:18.299> your<00:03:18.329> object<00:03:18.720> to<00:03:18.780> bend<00:03:19.019> how

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
to how you want your object to bend how

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.819 
to how you want your object to bend how
many<00:03:19.889> creases<00:03:20.190> you<00:03:20.519> have<00:03:20.760> like<00:03:21.090> for<00:03:21.540> instance

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
many creases you have like for instance

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.069 
many creases you have like for instance
in<00:03:22.829> if<00:03:23.489> I<00:03:23.669> was<00:03:23.819> in<00:03:24.000> object<00:03:24.449> mode<00:03:24.479> and<00:03:24.870> I<00:03:24.930> have

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
in if I was in object mode and I have

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.339 
in if I was in object mode and I have
this<00:03:25.229> object<00:03:25.519> if<00:03:26.519> I<00:03:26.729> well<00:03:27.449> let's<00:03:27.629> all<00:03:28.049> show<00:03:28.290> you

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
this object if I well let's all show you

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:31.039 
this object if I well let's all show you
here<00:03:28.709> let's<00:03:29.159> get<00:03:29.370> out<00:03:29.430> of<00:03:29.549> here<00:03:29.720> just<00:03:30.720> I'll<00:03:30.959> go

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
here let's get out of here just I'll go

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.780 
here let's get out of here just I'll go
back<00:03:31.169> into<00:03:31.409> object<00:03:31.769> mode<00:03:31.799> just<00:03:32.099> for<00:03:32.340> a<00:03:32.370> second

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
back into object mode just for a second

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.420 
back into object mode just for a second
and<00:03:33.120> we'll<00:03:33.299> pick<00:03:33.510> this<00:03:33.690> object<00:03:34.260> here<00:03:37.310> and<00:03:38.310> I'll

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
and we'll pick this object here and I'll

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.430 
and we'll pick this object here and I'll
go<00:03:38.519> into<00:03:38.729> edit<00:03:38.849> mode<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:39.629> notice<00:03:40.079> this<00:03:40.260> is<00:03:40.409> a

go into edit mode and notice this is a

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.490 
go into edit mode and notice this is a
really<00:03:40.769> this<00:03:41.400> is<00:03:41.579> a<00:03:41.609> bad<00:03:41.870> object<00:03:42.870> this<00:03:43.349> is<00:03:43.470> a

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
really this is a bad object this is a

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.339 
really this is a bad object this is a
bad<00:03:43.739> example<00:03:43.919> for<00:03:44.540> this<00:03:45.540> particular<00:03:45.780> one<00:03:46.169> this

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
bad example for this particular one this

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:47.479 
bad example for this particular one this
was<00:03:46.530> because<00:03:46.739> we<00:03:46.859> were<00:03:47.040> doing<00:03:47.280> the<00:03:47.370> other

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
was because we were doing the other

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.509 
was because we were doing the other
example<00:03:48.120> with<00:03:48.299> the<00:03:48.540> with<00:03:49.530> this<00:03:49.769> damped<00:03:50.190> track

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
example with the with this damped track

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.580 
example with the with this damped track
constraint<00:03:51.090> that<00:03:51.269> I<00:03:51.389> just<00:03:51.629> had<00:03:51.989> to<00:03:52.019> scale<00:03:52.379> this

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
constraint that I just had to scale this

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.289 
constraint that I just had to scale this
object<00:03:53.040> so<00:03:53.400> this<00:03:53.549> is<00:03:53.669> really<00:03:53.879> a<00:03:53.970> poor<00:03:54.180> example

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
object so this is really a poor example

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.270 
object so this is really a poor example
for<00:03:54.870> doing<00:03:55.440> that<00:03:55.530> but<00:03:55.680> maybe<00:03:55.979> I<00:03:56.069> had<00:03:56.250> a

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
for doing that but maybe I had a

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.509 
for doing that but maybe I had a
cylinder<00:03:57.269> to<00:03:57.389> start<00:03:57.689> with<00:03:57.900> and<00:03:58.139> I<00:03:58.470> had<00:03:58.590> used<00:03:58.859> my

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
cylinder to start with and I had used my

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:05.509 
cylinder to start with and I had used my
button<00:04:02.519> up<00:04:02.609> here<00:04:02.819> where<00:04:03.359> is<00:04:03.479> it<00:04:04.159> loop<00:04:05.159> cuttin

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
button up here where is it loop cuttin

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.179 
button up here where is it loop cuttin
slide<00:04:05.760> button<00:04:06.209> control<00:04:06.810> are<00:04:06.989> and<00:04:07.260> I<00:04:07.709> made<00:04:08.159> a

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:08.189 
slide button control are and I made a

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:10.039 
slide button control are and I made a
bunch<00:04:08.459> of<00:04:08.579> loops<00:04:08.790> along<00:04:08.970> the<00:04:09.299> way<00:04:09.419> well<00:04:09.959> you

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
bunch of loops along the way well you

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.349 
bunch of loops along the way well you
could<00:04:10.169> make<00:04:10.319> a<00:04:10.349> bunch<00:04:10.680> of<00:04:10.859> tight<00:04:11.639> loops<00:04:12.000> in<00:04:12.269> a

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
could make a bunch of tight loops in a

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:15.229 
could make a bunch of tight loops in a
closed<00:04:12.689> location<00:04:13.470> say<00:04:14.159> like<00:04:14.400> where<00:04:14.699> Annie<00:04:15.060> is

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
closed location say like where Annie is

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.089 
closed location say like where Annie is
and<00:04:15.629> then<00:04:15.840> you<00:04:16.380> would<00:04:16.500> have<00:04:16.530> more<00:04:16.859> control

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:17.099 
and then you would have more control

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:19.129 
and then you would have more control
over<00:04:17.370> the<00:04:17.699> way<00:04:17.820> that<00:04:18.060> bent<00:04:18.419> it<00:04:18.870> would<00:04:18.989> have

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
over the way that bent it would have

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:21.339 
over the way that bent it would have
more<00:04:19.320> control<00:04:19.470> over<00:04:19.709> the<00:04:19.919> way<00:04:20.039> your<00:04:20.310> mesh

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:21.349 
more control over the way your mesh

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:24.709 
more control over the way your mesh
moved<00:04:22.349> as<00:04:22.620> well<00:04:22.860> so<00:04:23.610> they<00:04:23.969> all<00:04:24.120> come<00:04:24.330> into<00:04:24.510> play

00:04:24.709 --> 00:04:24.719 
moved as well so they all come into play

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:26.269 
moved as well so they all come into play
but<00:04:24.990> we're<00:04:25.380> not<00:04:25.469> going<00:04:25.620> to<00:04:25.680> do<00:04:25.770> that<00:04:25.800> this<00:04:26.130> does

00:04:26.269 --> 00:04:26.279 
but we're not going to do that this does

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:26.900 
but we're not going to do that this does
exactly

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
exactly

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.060 
exactly
that's<00:04:27.060> a<00:04:27.150> terrible<00:04:27.630> objects<00:04:28.230> for<00:04:28.440> trying<00:04:28.950> to

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
that's a terrible objects for trying to

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.680 
that's a terrible objects for trying to
do<00:04:29.160> something<00:04:29.190> like<00:04:29.610> that<00:04:29.670> but<00:04:30.270> we'll<00:04:30.420> do<00:04:30.570> that

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
do something like that but we'll do that

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.750 
do something like that but we'll do that
in<00:04:30.750> the<00:04:30.990> more<00:04:31.440> intermediate<00:04:31.740> tutorials<00:04:32.400> there

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
in the more intermediate tutorials there

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.360 
in the more intermediate tutorials there
will<00:04:32.940> be<00:04:33.030> a<00:04:33.060> lot<00:04:33.420> of<00:04:33.450> tutorials<00:04:33.720> on<00:04:34.410> armatures

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
will be a lot of tutorials on armatures

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.740 
will be a lot of tutorials on armatures
and<00:04:35.670> bones<00:04:36.500> because<00:04:37.500> it's<00:04:37.650> a<00:04:37.920> fairly<00:04:38.750> advanced

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
and bones because it's a fairly advanced

and bones because it's a fairly advanced
subject<00:04:40.260> all<00:04:40.500> right<00:04:40.680> I<00:04:40.950> will<00:04:41.490> that<00:04:41.730> ought<00:04:41.820> to

subject all right I will that ought to

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.220 
subject all right I will that ought to
get<00:04:42.000> you<00:04:42.150> started<00:04:42.420> just<00:04:42.720> kind<00:04:43.020> of<00:04:43.050> play<00:04:43.200> around

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
get you started just kind of play around

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:44.780 
get you started just kind of play around
with<00:04:43.530> that<00:04:43.560> every<00:04:43.890> little<00:04:44.100> bit<00:04:44.160> helps<00:04:44.340> just

with that every little bit helps just

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.760 
with that every little bit helps just
take<00:04:45.000> it<00:04:45.090> a<00:04:45.180> bit<00:04:45.210> at<00:04:45.780> a<00:04:45.870> time<00:04:45.900> because<00:04:46.410> there's

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
take it a bit at a time because there's

take it a bit at a time because there's
a<00:04:46.830> boatload<00:04:47.640> of<00:04:47.910> learn<00:04:48.210> and<00:04:48.680> i'll<00:04:49.680> see<00:04:49.980> you<00:04:50.040> in
