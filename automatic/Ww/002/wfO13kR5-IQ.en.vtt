in<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.129> steak<00:00:41.399> we<00:00:42.030> hadn't<00:00:42.480> planned<00:00:42.690> on<00:00:42.960> though

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
in a steak we hadn't planned on though

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.779 
in a steak we hadn't planned on though
was<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.559> rain<00:00:43.770> shower<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.399> came<00:00:44.579> through

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
was the rain shower that came through

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.310 
was the rain shower that came through
here<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.210> things<00:00:45.450> have<00:00:45.600> gotten<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.930> little<00:00:46.200> bit

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
here so things have gotten a little bit

here so things have gotten a little bit
damp<00:00:46.559> I'm<00:00:47.250> convinced<00:00:47.820> we<00:00:47.910> could<00:00:48.059> work<00:00:48.210> around

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
damp I'm convinced we could work around

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.910 
damp I'm convinced we could work around
the<00:00:48.539> showers<00:00:48.870> what<00:00:49.020> do<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.140> think<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.410> think<00:00:49.710> so

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
the showers what do you think I think so

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.799 
the showers what do you think I think so
all<00:00:50.309> right<00:00:50.370> that's<00:00:50.910> good<00:00:51.180> take<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.420> one<00:00:51.660> more

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
all right that's good take it one more

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.869 
all right that's good take it one more
maybe<00:00:51.989> one<00:00:52.230> more<00:00:52.379> wrap<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.890> then<00:00:53.340> just<00:00:53.640> lay

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
maybe one more wrap and then just lay

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.850 
maybe one more wrap and then just lay
the<00:00:54.030> string<00:00:54.270> out<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:54.629> way<00:00:54.809> now<00:00:55.530> what<00:00:55.710> we've

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
the string out this way now what we've

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.099 
the string out this way now what we've
done<00:00:55.890> for<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.430> front<00:00:56.820> line<00:00:57.090> or<00:00:57.360> front<00:00:57.629> edge<00:00:57.899> of

done for the front line or front edge of
our<00:00:58.199> program<00:00:58.680> use<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.100> piece<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.399> 2x2<00:00:59.910> it's

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
our program use this piece of 2x2 it's

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.240 
our program use this piece of 2x2 it's
perfectly<00:01:00.719> straight<00:01:01.050> now<00:01:01.710> I'm<00:01:01.829> going<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.039> take

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
perfectly straight now I'm going to take

perfectly straight now I'm going to take
this<00:01:02.609> oversized<00:01:03.359> right<00:01:03.960> triangle<00:01:04.830> right<00:01:04.860> here

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
this oversized right triangle right here

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.230 
this oversized right triangle right here
put<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.880> base<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.540> up<00:01:06.689> against<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:08.240> 2x2

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
put the base of it up against that 2x2

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.109 
put the base of it up against that 2x2
just<00:01:09.570> like<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:10.250> bring<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.340> up<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.000> the

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
just like that bring it up so that the

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.940 
just like that bring it up so that the
edge<00:01:12.270> moves<00:01:12.689> right<00:01:12.930> at<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.229> string<00:01:13.740> they're

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
edge moves right at the string they're

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.929 
edge moves right at the string they're
ready<00:01:15.500> now<00:01:16.500> we<00:01:16.560> want<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.100> move<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.610> string

holes<00:03:36.930> right<00:03:37.200> here<00:03:37.260> but<00:03:38.070> the<00:03:38.190> reason<00:03:38.550> we<00:03:38.640> have

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
holes right here but the reason we have

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.160 
holes right here but the reason we have
so<00:03:39.030> much<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:39.300> this<00:03:39.420> isn't<00:03:39.570> all<00:03:39.780> of<00:03:39.900> it<00:03:39.990> by<00:03:40.110> the

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
so much and this isn't all of it by the

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.530 
so much and this isn't all of it by the
way<00:03:40.260> is<00:03:40.560> that<00:03:41.040> we<00:03:41.430> had<00:03:41.670> to<00:03:41.820> make<00:03:42.000> these<00:03:42.150> holes

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
way is that we had to make these holes

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.220 
way is that we had to make these holes
three<00:03:43.260> feet<00:03:43.620> deep<00:03:43.920> why<00:03:44.820> well<00:03:45.720> because<00:03:45.750> we're

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
three feet deep why well because we're

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.130 
three feet deep why well because we're
in<00:03:46.290> hurricane<00:03:46.800> country<00:03:46.830> here<00:03:47.490> and<00:03:48.140> the

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
in hurricane country here and the

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.449 
in hurricane country here and the
building<00:03:49.470> department<00:03:49.560> says<00:03:49.980> we've<00:03:50.130> got<00:03:50.160> to<00:03:50.370> go

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
building department says we've got to go

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.430 
building department says we've got to go
down<00:03:50.580> at<00:03:50.730> least<00:03:50.790> that<00:03:51.180> far<00:03:51.510> to<00:03:51.870> keep<00:03:52.170> this

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
down at least that far to keep this

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.070 
down at least that far to keep this
stable<00:03:53.190> at<00:03:53.340> a<00:03:53.400> high<00:03:53.580> wind<00:03:53.850> situation<00:03:54.510> so<00:03:54.930> we're

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
stable at a high wind situation so we're

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.720 
stable at a high wind situation so we're
actually<00:03:55.170> a<00:03:55.380> little<00:03:55.500> over<00:03:55.830> three<00:03:56.520> feet

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730

okay<00:05:59.280> guys<00:05:59.460> what<00:05:59.940> I've<00:06:00.030> done<00:06:00.210> is<00:06:00.360> I've<00:06:00.510> marked

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
okay guys what I've done is I've marked

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.190 
okay guys what I've done is I've marked
two<00:06:00.960> holes<00:06:01.230> up<00:06:01.500> here<00:06:01.740> on<00:06:01.919> a<00:06:01.950> diagonal<00:06:02.810> put<00:06:03.810> X's

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.200 
two holes up here on a diagonal put X's

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.300 
two holes up here on a diagonal put X's
you<00:06:04.350> see<00:06:04.530> where<00:06:04.680> they<00:06:04.770> are<00:06:04.800> I<00:06:05.100> do

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
you see where they are I do

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.610 
you see where they are I do
placing<00:06:05.910> the<00:06:06.030> bolts<00:06:06.300> diagonally<00:06:07.110> like<00:06:07.320> this

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
placing the bolts diagonally like this

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.830 
placing the bolts diagonally like this
reduces<00:06:08.250> the<00:06:08.310> chance<00:06:08.430> of<00:06:08.820> the<00:06:08.880> post<00:06:09.210> splitting

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 
reduces the chance of the post splitting

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.320 
reduces the chance of the post splitting
later<00:06:10.139> on<00:06:10.380> all<00:06:10.650> right<00:06:11.040> and<00:06:11.070> Bill<00:06:11.580> is<00:06:11.729> off<00:06:11.940> to<00:06:12.270> an

later on all right and Bill is off to an

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.450 
later on all right and Bill is off to an
early<00:06:12.450> lead<00:06:12.660> but<00:06:13.229> Francis<00:06:13.770> seems<00:06:14.070> to<00:06:14.310> be

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 
early lead but Francis seems to be

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.700 
early lead but Francis seems to be
catching<00:06:14.760> up<00:06:15.030> as<00:06:15.360> both<00:06:15.870> of<00:06:15.930> them<00:06:16.350> drill

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.710 
catching up as both of them drill

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.820 
catching up as both of them drill
aggressively<00:06:17.400> into<00:06:18.180> the<00:06:18.479> third<00:06:18.690> turn<00:06:19.050> Francis

aggressively into the third turn Francis

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.770 
aggressively into the third turn Francis
