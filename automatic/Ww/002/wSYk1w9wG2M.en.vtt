00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
to show you the dash here and I'll show

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.250 
to show you the dash here and I'll show
you<00:02:25.310> that<00:02:26.170> closer<00:02:27.170> if<00:02:27.320> I<00:02:27.470> can<00:02:28.930> hear<00:02:29.930> is<00:02:30.110> the

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
dash and you can see that it's often

well<00:02:51.020> you<00:02:51.140> can<00:02:51.230> see<00:02:51.470> that<00:02:51.500> but<00:02:51.950> I<00:02:52.220> made<00:02:52.820> the

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
well you can see that but I made the

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.810 
well you can see that but I made the
blinker<00:02:53.840> lever<00:02:54.680> and<00:02:54.980> everything<00:02:55.460> out<00:02:55.790> of

column<00:03:00.860> came<00:03:01.280> with<00:03:01.460> the<00:03:01.550> kit<00:03:01.700> so<00:03:01.760> I<00:03:01.940> made<00:03:02.240> my

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
column came with the kit so I made my

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.810 
column came with the kit so I made my
own<00:03:02.450> but<00:03:03.440> I<00:03:03.470> think<00:03:03.770> all<00:03:03.920> in<00:03:04.070> all<00:03:04.190> the<00:03:04.310> interior

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
own but I think all in all the interior

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.690 
own but I think all in all the interior
looks<00:03:05.030> really<00:03:05.390> nice<00:03:05.830> with<00:03:06.830> the<00:03:06.950> seats<00:03:07.310> you

can't really tell too well in the video
I<00:03:09.800> don't<00:03:10.040> think<00:03:10.310> but<00:03:10.640> they<00:03:11.390> have<00:03:11.600> like<00:03:11.780> a<00:03:11.810> pearl

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
I don't think but they have like a pearl

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.020 
I don't think but they have like a pearl
clear<00:03:12.470> coat<00:03:12.740> over<00:03:13.040> them<00:03:13.190> and<00:03:13.370> it<00:03:13.460> really<00:03:13.790> gives

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
clear coat over them and it really gives

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.090 
clear coat over them and it really gives
it<00:03:14.180> that<00:03:14.210> nice<00:03:14.540> a<00:03:14.600> final<00:03:15.170> look<00:03:15.380> I<00:03:15.680> don't<00:03:15.980> like

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
it that nice a final look I don't like

use that part Fox motor that I had but I
was<00:03:41.120> kind<00:03:41.720> of<00:03:41.750> stupid<00:03:41.930> and<00:03:42.260> I<00:03:42.350> didn't<00:03:42.620> test<00:03:42.830> fit

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
was kind of stupid and I didn't test fit

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.250 
was kind of stupid and I didn't test fit
before<00:03:43.280> I<00:03:43.880> painted<00:03:44.510> and<00:03:44.630> put<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:44.930> model

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
before I painted and put the model

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.470 
before I painted and put the model
together<00:03:45.350> and<00:03:46.130> it<00:03:46.340> actually<00:03:46.550> didn't<00:03:47.150> fit<00:03:47.360> in

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
together and it actually didn't fit in

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.140 
together and it actually didn't fit in
the<00:03:47.570> engine<00:03:47.600> bay<00:03:48.110> without<00:03:48.380> scale<00:03:49.010> so<00:03:49.790> I

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
the engine bay without scale so I

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.810 
the engine bay without scale so I
decided<00:03:50.480> just<00:03:50.630> to<00:03:50.810> go<00:03:50.960> with<00:03:51.140> a<00:03:51.200> stock<00:03:51.470> motor<00:03:51.820> as

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
decided just to go with a stock motor as

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.830

going to be putting on it
it's<00:04:19.130> the<00:04:19.220> parts<00:04:19.520> box<00:04:19.760> air<00:04:20.000> intake<00:04:20.359> and<00:04:20.780> it's

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
it's the parts box air intake and it's

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.710 
it's the parts box air intake and it's
chrome<00:04:21.620> and<00:04:22.100> then<00:04:22.550> of<00:04:22.669> course<00:04:22.700> the<00:04:23.270> inlet

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
chrome and then of course the inlet

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.870 
chrome and then of course the inlet
there<00:04:24.110> are<00:04:24.380> painted<00:04:24.830> that<00:04:25.040> same<00:04:25.310> color<00:04:25.550> as<00:04:25.729> the

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
there are painted that same color as the

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.010 
there are painted that same color as the
car<00:04:26.410> and<00:04:27.410> I<00:04:27.590> think<00:04:27.650> it<00:04:27.979> will<00:04:28.070> look<00:04:28.250> really<00:04:28.280> nice

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
car and I think it will look really nice

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.740 
car and I think it will look really nice
sitting<00:04:30.020> on<00:04:30.229> top<00:04:30.410> of<00:04:30.470> the<00:04:30.680> motor<00:04:30.919> the<00:04:31.850> gold<00:04:32.360> and

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
sitting on top of the motor the gold and

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.590 
sitting on top of the motor the gold and
red<00:04:33.020> really<00:04:33.350> accent<00:04:33.919> each<00:04:34.010> other<00:04:34.270> so<00:04:35.270> it'll<00:04:35.510> be

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
red really accent each other so it'll be

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.659 
red really accent each other so it'll be
it'll<00:04:35.810> be<00:04:35.870> sitting<00:04:36.260> on<00:04:36.350> there<00:04:36.590> kind<00:04:37.400> of<00:04:37.490> like

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669

it'll be sitting on there kind of like
that<00:04:37.880> and<00:04:38.510> I<00:04:38.660> think<00:04:38.870> it's<00:04:38.990> going<00:04:39.260> to<00:04:39.320> look

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410
