00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.920
 hello and welcome back to 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.450
 ebay.com dyer and today we take that 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.880
 first time with a good one 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.440
 recording program on namely fraps her 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.030
 maybe it will see a little red 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.560
 Paying in the corner maybe she is 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.720
 with you also yellow so well I know myself 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.250
 not yet and I do not know how 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:32.619
 such just my repeater through the 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:35.500
 so today we have one 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.969
 little lamb blog video because I have the 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.550
 Things are very cool and you find it completely 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:40.540
 funny things can join 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.660
 I would say we catch that 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:49.200
 epic know the same 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:51.730
 many of you the slopes z wave dingens 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.290
 relatively crazy video yes and with that 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.360
 place you can easily with the whole 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:01:01.059
 to adjust my cards I turn that off 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:03.910
 just once the whole place looks like 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.920
 I personally was very cool because that was 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.280
 previously without mods not so easy 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.280
 possible 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:17.440
 yes, I did it that way too 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.440
 a little bit 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.000
 she sat 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.509
 crap 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:36.020
 I'm not that practiced with fraps yet 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.610
 So it could be that the death 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.640
 It could be that of the salamander 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.200
 sometimes mixed a bit badly 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.369
 I just have to be a microphone 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.369
 a little higher 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.179
 it could be that the sound a bit 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.710
 bad from mixed to some 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:55.710
 just like me for example 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.390
 just not so good then yes 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.259
 Let's continue slime blocks, then 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:05.429
 I have the same wave in here again 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:08.940
 one-dimensional, so to speak, looks like this 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:10.700
 I also find it funny to brake 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.069
 can not get through here 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:17.870
 if you fly through then you do that 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:20.269
 whole broken something we still have 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.860
 with the help of slime blocks can be 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.900
 a very easy block very simple 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.060
 blog update detector build 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.989
 whenever I'm anywhere next to this 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.010
 then something will piste 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.019
 to move briefly 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.380
 There are certainly application possibilities 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:38.060
 for that I have not found anything yet 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:44.290
 It's really funny if you have one here 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:47.209
 next to the slopes then it is now 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.090
 extended and at the height of the live blogs 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.349
 is now when I put her bell 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.720
 It's still at the top of the line blog 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.579
 but not extended 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.220
 if i make it the way it is on height 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:00.590
 of the council and blogs and i started 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.000
 build something again then he got that 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.349
 back down and when I go away again 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.540
 make it up again and so on 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.640
 on and on 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.410
 I find it funny I do not know if 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.930
 the fact is I tried that 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:17.389
 to produce 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:18.410
 with a nice sable circuit 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:20.840
 I do not know how to do that 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.810
 German country but it does not have 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.620
 is working 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:29.359
 because it stays up there now 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.150
 I find that somehow strange but 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:33.650
 no matter 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.180
 so two blocks with exactly 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.569
 Slime blocks can be a very 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.630
 to build a simple door 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:44.769
 the idea is the way of the prisoner 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.769
 I'm sure many of you know 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.639
 and yes that actually works completely 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.940
 I can just look like this from here 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:54.670
 the side the slopes are against 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.799
 each other a bit high 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.660
 and then the door is open and too important 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.190
 that everything laimbÃ¶ck touches and 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.650
 should not be moved from obsidian 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.730
 or something is not something of the 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.730
 pistols can be moved 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.489
 then something cool can be done 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.780
 do with his blog 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:16.290
 I take my redstone blog 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:21.260
 and that is one thing perfect 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:23.390
 completely independent flying machine 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.830
 I think that's cool 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.290
 It could be that the runway fans know 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.790
 So I'm sorry for that 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.830
 me in advance is already wrong 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.610
 is because as I said I am 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.610
 especially practiced 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.310
 yes, the man unfortunately falls through the 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.310
 machine through 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.820
 so and units simply by doing 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:54.470
 getting rid of the block does this too 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.470
 relatively fast one comes quite far 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.449
 then the last thing I show today 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:04.650
 I do not want to have so much time today 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:06.720
 is a bit pointless but quite whole 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:10.710
 funny little toy and that is 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.830
 it's easy so we have slime blocks 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.780
 the property when you jump on it 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.550
 then 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.010
 then you build up a bit like that 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.980
 a trampoline and if a runway 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.870
 underneath it is decided that a high and 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.610
 I used both properties around 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:30.830
 a small automatic trampoline too 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:32.780
 does not work perfect though 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.850
 but very good 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:39.330
 I think it 's funny somehow 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:41.190
 completely pointless but the good one is 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.720
 only needs a single run 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.060
 if you take more you can not do it at all 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.470
 because this lay alone living together 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:52.030
 and it just works like that 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:56.120
 that I fall while this one 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:57.800
 trigger tripping threads and the against 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:01.160
 a safety vest and signal down to the 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:11.419
 slopes and that is moving a blog in 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:14.780
 I went upstairs and that was it 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:17.180
 Actually, I already have it there 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.050
 once a piste wave in small 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.240
 recreated 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:25.460
 oh my god the world the world 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:29.350
 generation hire but again I 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.350
 find the great looks a player must 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.030
 Yes 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.670
 Yes 

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.850
 then to escape 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:45.560
 So that's mine again 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.060
 first video after some time around the 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.560
 Runway sounds I think I have to 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.660
 drop the volume again 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.979
 So for me it is very loud me 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.160
 Do not know if it's just as loud for you 

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:56.840
 So that's the first video now 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.580
 for a long time now because I am one 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.260
 had a bit of trouble with a setup 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:03.800
 my microphone did not like me 

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:05.930
 wanted and recording programs then too 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.790
 not that should be the first 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:14.930
 It's really going to be a liquid intake 

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:17.030
 so my channel is yes yes that was 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:20.860
 I want to say it then 

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:20.860
 until next time
