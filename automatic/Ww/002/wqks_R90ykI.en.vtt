Good afternoon, I am Dr. Haffensteiner

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.420
and I'll be your professor for Chemistry 131

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.160
One thing I want to go over with you first:

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.680
I know a lot of you are freshmen.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.000
How many of you are freshmen in here?

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.640
Most of you, yeah.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.200
Something you want to know about this class: 
this class is extremely hard.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.960
Last year 55% of this class failed.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.560
That's something I wanted to say right now, so that it's in your mind.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.800
Are any of you interested in going to med-school? Alright, show up hands.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.360
That all? If you want to just... I have with these little demonstrations.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.800
If you could just stand up

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.000
It's a quick visual thing, if you could just stand up.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.120
Quiet, please! Quiet!

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.120
Take a look around, see who is standing!

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.800
I need everyone in the left hand section and the middle section to sit down.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.840
Quiet! Quiet, please!

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.080
Take a look at those [unintelligible] who are still standing.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.600
That's the portion of people who will make it to medical school.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.240
About this, or maybe half, or maybe all of them.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.120
This is something that is one of my biggest pet peeves:

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.920
Laptop and cellphones. I don't like them in class.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.520
I think they are distracting to the learning process and you will probably be on Facebook all the time.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.800
So if you have a laptop, please put it away!

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.120
Don't take it out for the rest of the semester!

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.160
Don't take your cellphones out. I don't want them to hear them ring or anything like that.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:21.040
In the future, if I see you with a laptop or cellphone, I'll bring you out to class, I'll take your ID and write your name down

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.800
and there may be repercussions on your grade.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.920
Ok, so...

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.440
Let's get started with a little
