00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.809
 hello to all kids welcome to me 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.910
 channel one more time I'm javi codema and today 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:18.310
 I bring you the fifth chapter of the series 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.169
 what people want to see in gta 5 that 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.599
 it seems that he is succeeding in the 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:24.220
 channel and proof of them are the 43 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:26.770
 comments that you left jce in the 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.869
 previous episode before anything else say 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.079
 that if I do not read a comment it 's because 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:34.660
 I 've already commented on other episodes 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:36.969
 let's start the great hancco 2011 ask for more 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.190
 tiptoe and a huge hospital besides 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:40.989
 on tiptoe real photos what's 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.910
 hospital is very safe about the 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:46.180
 tiptoes I think it's an obsession that 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.760
 has together with sergio 11 thousand 989 and javi 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.649
 gta 5 so I can only tell you that you 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.410
 Do you watch porn instead of asking 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.570
 whores in video games jaja rafa wants 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.790
 when there are witnesses to the murders 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.890
 these take pictures for the police and 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.110
 that they interrogate witnesses and 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.420
 that they paste search posters the 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.490
 sure signs that this will not be 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.469
 it would be somewhat old-fashioned the other I see it 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.689
 difficult but they implant a great 

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:12.969
 system for the police guide something 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:14.139
 that asks a lot of people this could be 

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:15.340
 I presented 

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:17.259
 ag gamer bus min 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.270
 I wish I could keep in the trunk 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:22.270
 of the car things like food to cure 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.219
 health or weapons here yes I have doubts already 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.439
 we saw in other gt as n times 

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:28.990
 they interacted with the trunk but never 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:31.240
 we could do this it would be fine that 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.709
 could include in the game imagines 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.630
 a mission in which we could 

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:35.920
 get ammunition or health from our 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.590
 car instead of having to search 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.909
 medicine cabinets and things like that 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.950
 sebastián expensive bar wants that between the 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.530
 military vehicles there are gamers with 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.509
 machine guns behind the hammers 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.340
 it is very possible especially if we 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.890
 we agreed that they already had in the san 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.530
 Andreas the Patriot, although they did not use 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.539
 to chase afonso ski martins 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.329
 scallop wants a fall system like 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:00.579
 The GTA 4 because it was funny the 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:03.009
 graphics engines evolve will be 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.659
 similar but not identical engines 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:08.860
 rage and euphoria graphics have 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.929
 evolved from gta 4 sniper 394 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.209
 he wants to be able to get vehicles on planes 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.400
 of charging and directing zeppelin is what 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.650
 first it's almost confirmed because what 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.690
 we saw in trailer 2 and the second the 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.250
 I really have serious doubts about the role of 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.700
 the zeppelins in the game 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.260
 rockstar 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.390
 he has made it clear that he will know 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.090
 having appeared several times in the 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.340
 trailers and in the images it seems that no 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.700
 but it is something that has me very intrigued 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.019
 and take a zeppelin would be something incredible 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.230
 amorphous cardoso wants activities 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:40.269
 underwater how to look for treasures is good 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.670
 a possibility having already seen the 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.620
 diving and the submarine you may have 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.780
 activities related to the fund 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.790
 of the ocean safe since they are not going to do 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.650
 something so complicated to detail for 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.989
 just a couple of missions 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.970
 robert mak boy gta 5 fan wants to have a 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.650
 Realistic work outside missions 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.599
 where you can be fired and be able to 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.900
 travel to space with the nasa or something 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:04.060
 seemed sincerely both I see them little 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.549
 probable about the first thing we should 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.920
 remember that it is a gta not a simulator 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:11.200
 of life are not the sims we can not 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.569
 ask for such realism to the game though 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.250
 that would be good to surround or do 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.530
 videos haha and the second is very 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.780
 unlikely the truth would not make sense 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.790
 I without García Sandoval wants 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.700
 customization in weapons and all kinds of 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.410
 assault stuff and bands in multiplayer 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.540
 the first is almost one hundred percent 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.400
 sure you just have to watch the trailer 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.439
 with men with the gas mask and 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.569
 the rifles with silencer and images 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:37.120
 later in which we see laser sights 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.549
 the bands in the multiplayer would be a 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.500
 breakthrough in the complicated multiplayer of 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:43.180
 implement but it is true that 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.010
 rockstar said he wanted one of the 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.319
 strong points of the game was the 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.599
 Bio multiplayer chord wants 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:51.760
 the cars when they suffer collisions 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:54.609
 they can break warp and that kind of 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.709
 good things in trailer 2 we saw the 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:59.019
 shock of two cars and although not to a 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.909
 very very realistic level yes it is true that 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.680
 the effect was very good 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:05.260
 fernando martínez want the return of 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.239
 the night vision glasses because I do not see 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.799
 why not haha it's just that 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.829
 rockstar is to it is 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:13.389
 perfectly possible porterito 11 says 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.340
 who would like to use a shield 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:18.190
 riot police with a submachine gun in the 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.079
 another hand, because I really do not know this anymore 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.090
 it is in other games but it is not the 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.280
 rockstar style so I think not 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.020
 will be in the game benjamin brown 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.910
 he wants that when you get wet you can not 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.789
 use for a while the mobile to be 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:33.340
 damaged I repeat the same thing this is not the 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:35.289
 sims x from miguel navarro wants that in 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.360
 function of the police stars 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:39.339
 this is more time in jail and you can 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.550
 ride riots and escape and be able to put 

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:45.039
 the time in 24 hour mode is to say as 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.259
 a normal day the first thing I do not see it for 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:50.259
 nothing likely does not hit the ones you have 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:52.689
 the second is possible but I do not think 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:54.999
 that they include it in the game because this has 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:57.460
 been everything I love that I can do the 

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:59.409
 video only with your comments this 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.629
 shows that you like the series so 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:03.249
 I can only ask you to continue commenting 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:06.449
 I hope you liked it 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:06.449
 greetings kids
