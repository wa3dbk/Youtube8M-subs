00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
um I think he goes like 25 and 17 or

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.180 
um I think he goes like 25 and 17 or
something<00:00:54.239> but<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:54.570> know<00:00:54.920> playing<00:00:55.920> just

out<00:00:59.640> some<00:00:59.910> stuff<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.449> know<00:01:00.570> first<00:01:00.870> kill<00:01:01.199> first

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
out some stuff you know first kill first

blood here's my right hand corner I

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.500 
blood here's my right hand corner I

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
look down and if there was like a bunch

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.170 
look down and if there was like a bunch
of<00:03:42.840> ratliff<00:03:43.379> stuff<00:03:43.709> it<00:03:44.430> would<00:03:44.639> literally<00:03:44.940> just

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
of ratliff stuff it would literally just

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.119 
of ratliff stuff it would literally just
do<00:03:45.299> like<00:03:45.389> a<00:03:45.450> like<00:03:45.780> five<00:03:46.139> real<00:03:46.500> bricks<00:03:46.859> and<00:03:47.040> then

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:51.979 
do like a like five real bricks and then
the<00:03:47.250> done<00:03:47.819> like<00:03:49.790> but<00:03:50.790> then<00:03:50.939> on<00:03:51.239> the<00:03:51.359> ground<00:03:51.629> it

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
the done like but then on the ground it

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.589 
the done like but then on the ground it
would<00:03:52.139> just<00:03:52.290> be<00:03:52.500> a<00:03:53.250> pattern<00:03:54.000> of<00:03:54.120> sorts<00:03:54.480> but

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
would just be a pattern of sorts but

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:55.910 
would just be a pattern of sorts but
this<00:03:54.780> looks<00:03:54.900> like<00:03:55.079> it<00:03:55.170> actually<00:03:55.230> has<00:03:55.560> height

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920
