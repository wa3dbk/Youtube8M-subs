title bonding system and you've got your

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.350 
title bonding system and you've got your
overly<00:01:27.570> mushroomed<00:01:28.610> title<00:01:29.610> separator<00:01:30.090> here

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
overly mushroomed title separator here

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.910

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
carefully just around outside just try

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.960 
carefully just around outside just try
to<00:01:34.860> get<00:01:35.810> about<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:37.170> quarter<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:38.490> five

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
to get about a quarter to five

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.130 
to get about a quarter to five
sixteenths<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.840> an<00:01:39.960> inch<00:01:40.400> clearance<00:01:41.810> just<00:01:42.810> so

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
sixteenths of an inch clearance just so

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.920 
sixteenths of an inch clearance just so
you<00:01:43.320> can<00:01:43.530> get<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:43.920> bonding<00:01:44.579> system<00:01:45.299> in<00:01:45.659> there

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
you can get that bonding system in there

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.710 
you can get that bonding system in there
here<00:01:46.920> we've<00:01:47.070> got<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.369> looks<00:01:48.090> just<00:01:48.180> over<00:01:48.689> a

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
here we've got it looks just over a

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.330 
here we've got it looks just over a
quarter<00:01:48.960> inch<00:01:49.229> but<00:01:49.409> that's<00:01:49.560> okay<00:01:49.860> we<00:01:50.009> can<00:01:50.040> work

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
quarter inch but that's okay we can work

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.030 
quarter inch but that's okay we can work
with<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:51.079> make<00:01:52.079> sure<00:01:52.110> any<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.649> older

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
with that and make sure any of the older

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.889 
with that and make sure any of the older
glue<00:01:53.399> has<00:01:53.670> already<00:01:54.090> been<00:01:54.470> removed<00:01:55.470> from

glue has already been removed from
around<00:01:57.899> at<00:01:58.170> least<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.530> exposed<00:01:59.009> area<00:01:59.490> because

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
around at least the exposed area because

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.700 
around at least the exposed area because
the<00:02:00.270> bonding<00:02:00.869> system<00:02:01.049> isn't<00:02:01.320> going<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.590> work

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
the bonding system isn't going to work

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.830 
the bonding system isn't going to work
well<00:02:02.189> with<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:02.880> stuff<00:02:03.180> there<00:02:03.829> now

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
well with that stuff there now

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.599 
well with that stuff there now
once<00:02:06.530> you<00:02:06.619> have<00:02:06.770> your<00:02:06.890> bonding<00:02:07.250> system<00:02:07.399> you

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:07.609 
once you have your bonding system you

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:09.070 
once you have your bonding system you
want<00:02:07.729> to<00:02:07.880> make<00:02:08.000> sure<00:02:08.030> that<00:02:08.330> the<00:02:08.479> applicator

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
want to make sure that the applicator

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.110 
want to make sure that the applicator
tip<00:02:09.379> is<00:02:10.750> just<00:02:11.750> just<00:02:12.620> pointing<00:02:12.950> out<00:02:13.010> that<00:02:13.310> be

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
tip is just just pointing out that be

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.720 
tip is just just pointing out that be
able<00:02:14.330> to<00:02:14.420> get<00:02:14.569> to<00:02:14.780> it<00:02:14.810> you're<00:02:15.230> just<00:02:15.379> gonna<00:02:18.730> just

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
able to get to it you're just gonna just
