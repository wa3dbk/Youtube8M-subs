00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.960
 many times when we think of beauty 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.480
 we think about things that are beautiful and we 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.459
 we refer to visual characteristics 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.529
 but the truth is that beauty is the 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:17.260
 property of the things that makes love 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:19.060
 infusing from the inter piri twal the 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.760
 beauty affects us in terms 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.200
 energetic in our vibration raises 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.360
 our vibrations generate us 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.980
 welfare generates balance 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.450
 Beauty is something wonderful that exists 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.280
 in nature and in created things 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.739
 also by man as works 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.930
 artistic beauty literary pieces 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:39.100
 we perceive it with the five senses and 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.839
 with our energy these senses is the 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.149
 how we perceive things 

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:45.339
 and also when we create beauty 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:46.839
 we can understand and be inspired to 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:48.370
 to be able to create beauty that is going to be 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:50.949
 perceived through these five 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.539
 senses when we think about how we went 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:55.809
 created when we think about what is the 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:58.359
 nature of the human being and we think about 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:01.329
 well here we believe in what they want to create 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:03.699
 god the nature consequence type of 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.830
 consciousness that create who organized the 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:06.870
 energy for the human being to be like 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.240
 It is the planet 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.759
 diverse and everything that exists 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.790
 that energy that consciousness created us in 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:16.710
 perfect balance that consciousness now 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.590
 same energy in a way 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.570
 extremely beautiful and this energy is 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.060
 absolutely unlimited when we speak 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.340
 of nature and we see a lot of 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.689
 species and we see a lot of animals and 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.090
 that all are beautiful all are perfect 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.460
 created in perfect order and they are all 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.070
 different from each other so we went 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.929
 created in us in perfect order with 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.299
 harmony and with beauty and with the ability 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:45.539
 to be able to create it also when we speak 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.340
 of for example the trees the trees or 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.440
 if it was the same species the trees are 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.090
 all different and so has also been 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.450
 created the human being the human being has 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.090
 been created in harmony has been created 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.700
 with balance and has also been created 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.319
 in a unique way we think that the 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.080
 The beginning of time has not existed 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:06.899
 two equal human beings each being 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.780
 human is irreplaceable is a being 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.400
 unrepeatable and then from this 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.189
 each person has a beauty 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.860
 It has beautiful characteristics of forms 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:18.660
 different 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.060
 and this is important because when 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.860
 we think about culture when we go to the 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.110
 culture that is many times the way that 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.220
 we have to measure we measure our 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.050
 beauty we measure our success we measure 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.090
 many times who are we in relation to 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:37.140
 these stereotypes of beauty and what 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:40.590
 we call stereotypes of beauty in the 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.410
 culture are models of beauty that are 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.300
 models created by man are not 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.970
 models created by consciousness 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.090
 then we use these stereotypes 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.020
 these beauty models to calculate 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.709
 if we are beautiful 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:58.860
 if not if we need beauty yes yes yes the 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:01.350
 success if we are successful if we do not associate 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.690
 sometimes success with beauty but the 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.310
 reality is that the more we believe in 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.130
 these stereotypes and these models of 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.530
 more real beauty we turn them in 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.820
 our farthest we are from our 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.209
 serious repeatable is irreplaceable 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.970
 because we are trying to unify and 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.640
 of 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.340
 and to amalgamate us with something that in 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.170
 reality is not how we are what is very 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.750
 important is to be able to understand what the 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.900
 beauty of every person every human being 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.540
 It has beauty and it is beautiful naturally 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.810
 only that sometimes it's not like these 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.580
 cultural stereotypes mark us what 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.230
 what is important to highlight is also 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.330
 that these cultural stereotypes have 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.640
 been created by man not by the 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.340
 men but by man then 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.220
 it also depends on each culture and in many 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.290
 societies exist their cultures in turn 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.990
 these beauty models are changing 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.720
 based on how are each of the 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:58.120
 cultures then everything is completely 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.190
 relative what I think we have to 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.260
 sometimes start to stop believing so much 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.880
 in that you sometimes chase these 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.530
 beauty models distance us from 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.780
 our own beauty make many 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:12.160
 Sometimes we can not see it many times 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:15.130
 Sometimes we begin to fill ourselves in wanting 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.930
 It is expected to be like us and that so 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.180
 that we distance ourselves and that even from 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.090
 ourselves and that even 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.340
 to take a path that takes us away from 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.650
 our beauty and that the idea is that 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.530
 we can resume this path to return 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.449
 to us and stop believing stop 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.240
 pay so much attention sometimes to how 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:36.120
 we should be and be the best version of 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.830
 our true self that we can create 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.350
 we can communicate through 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.180
 our image of our beauty that is 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.850
 a non-verbal language in the most 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.370
 honestly possible with in addition this beauty 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.050
 when we can create it for us 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.660
 harmonizes also in our link with 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.449
 the others then we have beauty all 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:58.060
 we are beautiful and this the theme is that we are 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:00.099
 beautiful in different ways and that's what 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.110
 that with that we have to connect with that 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:04.150
 capacity we have to connect and with 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.800
 our ability to give beauty what is 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.750
 what makes us unique what is it that we 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.509
 makes unrepeatable and what do we 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:13.000
 makes irreplaceable in the world and power 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:15.160
 create it for others this is something very 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.780
 important through the chapters 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.849
 let's go talking about issues that 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.810
 they have to do with beauty with the 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:23.889
 wellness with balance 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.889
 well we continue with more
