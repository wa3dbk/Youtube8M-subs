happen well we don't know where they're
going<00:02:09.140> to<00:02:09.259> happen<00:02:09.619> but<00:02:10.069> we<00:02:10.250> did<00:02:10.429> predict<00:02:10.849> for

going to happen but we did predict for

would see more seesmic activity and

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.720 
would see more seesmic activity and
we<00:02:18.000> had<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.300> triggering<00:02:18.690> of<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:19.730> volcano

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
we had the triggering of the volcano

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.820 
we had the triggering of the volcano
chain<00:02:21.000> in<00:02:21.180> Chile<00:02:21.420> then<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:21.870> this<00:02:22.470> period

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
you do you pass it on to government's

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.830 
you do you pass it on to government's
concern<00:02:47.430> do<00:02:47.700> you<00:02:47.820> do<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:48.510> tell<00:02:48.690> them<00:02:48.810> that

this is what I generally they we do

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.860 
this is what I generally they we do
inform<00:02:53.730> governments<00:02:54.240> we<00:02:54.390> inform<00:02:54.720> the

would<00:02:56.610> come<00:02:56.820> but<00:02:57.030> they<00:02:57.210> ignored<00:02:57.570> us

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
would come but they ignored us

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.480 
would come but they ignored us
completely<00:02:58.140> because<00:02:58.980> they<00:02:59.100> prefer<00:02:59.460> to

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
completely because they prefer to

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.720 
completely because they prefer to
believe<00:02:59.760> in<00:03:00.090> other<00:03:00.240> things<00:03:00.570> like<00:03:01.040> co2<00:03:02.040> driving

everything which of course is complete

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.950 
everything which of course is complete
nonsense<00:03:04.530> but<00:03:05.370> we<00:03:05.700> will<00:03:05.880> we<00:03:06.060> hopefully<00:03:06.390> having

nonsense but we will we hopefully having
a<00:03:07.050> conference<00:03:07.410> in<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.740> autumn<00:03:08.220> where<00:03:08.430> we<00:03:08.550> talk

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
a conference in the autumn where we talk

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.180 
a conference in the autumn where we talk
a<00:03:08.760> bit<00:03:09.030> more<00:03:09.060> about<00:03:09.510> practical<00:03:10.410> application

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
a bit more about practical application

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.450 
a bit more about practical application
of<00:03:11.540> severe<00:03:12.540> went<00:03:12.960> warnings<00:03:13.800> okay<00:03:14.250> so<00:03:14.310> you

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
of severe went warnings okay so you

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.400 
of severe went warnings okay so you
believe<00:03:14.850> it's<00:03:15.060> a<00:03:15.150> natural<00:03:15.450> reaction<00:03:16.020> to

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
believe it's a natural reaction to

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.720 
believe it's a natural reaction to
what's<00:03:16.590> happening<00:03:16.710> in<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.100> world<00:03:17.130> what<00:03:17.460> about

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
what's happening in the world what about

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.960 
what's happening in the world what about
man-made<00:03:18.650> equities<00:03:19.650> we<00:03:19.890> know<00:03:20.160> it<00:03:20.340> is<00:03:20.550> ok<00:03:20.910> you

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
man-made equities we know it is ok you

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.890 
man-made equities we know it is ok you
know<00:03:21.180> it<00:03:21.360> is<00:03:21.480> do<00:03:22.110> man-made<00:03:22.620> activities<00:03:23.900> play

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
know it is do man-made activities play

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.870 
know it is do man-made activities play
any<00:03:25.170> role<00:03:25.410> at<00:03:25.620> all<00:03:25.740> you<00:03:26.130> mean<00:03:26.280> like<00:03:26.310> carbon

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
any role at all you mean like carbon

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.150 
any role at all you mean like carbon
dioxide<00:03:27.330> no<00:03:27.720> carbon<00:03:28.230> doctor<00:03:28.560> doesn't<00:03:28.770> like<00:03:28.950> it

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
dioxide no carbon doctor doesn't like it

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.680 
dioxide no carbon doctor doesn't like it
and<00:03:29.310> there's<00:03:29.460> gues<00:03:29.700> fracking<00:03:30.270> that<00:03:30.450> we'd<00:03:30.600> be

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
and there's gues fracking that we'd be

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.570 
and there's gues fracking that we'd be
talking<00:03:30.960> the<00:03:31.290> weather<00:03:31.500> is<00:03:31.800> that<00:03:32.040> would<00:03:32.460> the

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
talking the weather is that would the

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.640 
talking the weather is that would the
weather<00:03:32.760> drive<00:03:33.210> carbon<00:03:33.870> dioxide<00:03:34.320> not<00:03:34.530> the

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
weather drive carbon dioxide not the

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:35.990 
weather drive carbon dioxide not the
other<00:03:34.800> way<00:03:34.980> around<00:03:35.010> okay<00:03:35.730> what<00:03:35.910> about

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
other way around okay what about

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.170 
other way around okay what about
drilling<00:03:36.510> for<00:03:36.840> gas<00:03:36.870> drive<00:03:37.500> co2<00:03:38.130> levels<00:03:38.640> pond

what<00:03:39.690> about<00:03:39.780> jennifer<00:03:40.350> gets<00:03:40.500> in<00:03:40.830> it<00:03:41.210> sure<00:03:42.210> if

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
what about jennifer gets in it sure if

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.630 
what about jennifer gets in it sure if
you<00:03:42.900> do<00:03:43.110> that<00:03:43.320> in<00:03:43.500> certain<00:03:43.740> areas<00:03:44.100> then

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
you do that in certain areas then

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.970 
you do that in certain areas then
obviously<00:03:44.820> that<00:03:45.330> can<00:03:45.600> lead<00:03:45.870> to<00:03:45.980> earthquakes

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
obviously that can lead to earthquakes

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.530 
obviously that can lead to earthquakes
and<00:03:47.540> local<00:03:48.540> problems<00:03:49.250> but<00:03:50.250> that's<00:03:50.430> like<00:03:50.790> you

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
and local problems but that's like you

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.680 
and local problems but that's like you
know<00:03:51.690> kind<00:03:52.560> of<00:03:52.650> a<00:03:52.800> physical<00:03:53.220> direct<00:03:54.030> effect<00:03:54.420> in

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
know kind of a physical direct effect in

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.830 
know kind of a physical direct effect in
in<00:03:54.990> in<00:03:55.260> quite<00:03:56.040> a<00:03:56.070> small<00:03:56.400> region<00:03:56.610> but<00:03:57.360> if<00:03:57.690> you

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
in in quite a small region but if you

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.500 
in in quite a small region but if you
drill<00:03:58.260> a<00:03:58.290> lot<00:03:58.500> of<00:03:58.650> gas<00:03:58.800> out<00:03:59.090> soma<00:04:00.090> coal<00:04:00.270> mining
