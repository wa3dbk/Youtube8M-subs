00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 hey people today is a video about 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.799
 the future of this channel here 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.320
 it's about what canal will live in the future 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.900
 That's why I say 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.240
 now first the formats of this channel 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.100
 you provide it to be 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.410
 first times ten and facts that you 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.380
 did not know what the format does 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.109
 I think it became obvious 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.460
 then ten pokémon type son so that 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.460
 should also be pretty self 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.030
 then explain poker uni where i set of 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.770
 competition then local radio 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.790
 what it is exactly because there are still 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.270
 not in the channel, I will soon 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.920
 but then say openings of 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.480
 various things just generally 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.850
 often and pokémon stuff like dolls and 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.180
 cards from middle where i got over one 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.559
 myth or myths 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.820
 the last video with synonymous something there 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.760
 I've been laying about the youtube 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.530
 talked and folk and facts that are 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.449
 game announcements that is us one 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.280
 new game on the market is such 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.480
 example the seventh generation and it 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.670
 There are some left in the direction 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.700
 then in five acts you will be told what 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.310
 exactly what exactly is results and so 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.130
 Keep it up then it still depends 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.930
 there are on the channel and info videos 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.880
 this is an info video faq itself 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.500
 sometimes even made one and then 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.270
 you see, I still have games in here 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.700
 that is also a topic 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.189
 what I wanted to talk about I have yes 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.130
 times wifi fighter considerable channel like that 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.159
 that will not happen anymore because of me 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.530
 if i want to play with plans or 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.930
 I'll just pick that up 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.060
 another channel but make up 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.860
 no case in the near future even 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.479
 no case in this time and with 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.790
 next time because I'm not next 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.450
 Maybe not next week in the next month 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.009
 This may take forever next year 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.140
 I really want to get up first 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.880
 focus on this channel 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.680
 and yes the video I should definitely 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.189
 times show which formats are there to 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.110
 the canal 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.549
 what awaits you on this channel because 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.619
 I often have it already 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.950
 some other channels have seen that 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.830
 spectators almost on the content 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.020
 determine 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.310
 and like this content now on the 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.890
 channel designed like this 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.260
 these formats are rampant so is the channel 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.880
 Perfect for me if someone like that 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.470
 I can not say it can 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.080
 of course always new formats 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.240
 But that's her first series 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.470
 who would like to come on the canal then 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.310
 of course, explain what is poker 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.960
 radio radio is a new idea of ​​mine 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.480
 been and from the idea where I am 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.300
 inspired by grant live tv so one 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.450
 montis channel of reviews and everything 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.130
 possible and in any case poker radio 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.400
 on a channel it is basically 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:42.040
 and short and much cut videos 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.230
 sometimes three to five minutes 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.230
 a bit longer poker radio is something 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:51.490
 something new a change from 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:54.550
 that these short videos from radio 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:57.340
 is a format in which at the 20 to 30 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.720
 talking about a topic for several minutes 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.990
 and cut to order 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.250
 that is exactly the contrast to the 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.020
 other videos out there now and 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.930
 then I would like to apologize 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:11.890
 because like so many times I have been one 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.780
 a monthlong break of videos like 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.780
 does it happen so how can it happen? 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.540
 that a video comes for a month 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.230
 the question is simply explained 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.080
 school 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.180
 I have not had time at the moment 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.730
 because I had important exams 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.950
 but what I want to say can only be me 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.840
 excuse me because the school is in 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.150
 Just imagine the case and I'll tell you 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.550
 that I'm definitely going to 21 now 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.130
 I have the third 5 to 21 05 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.290
 I have a good deal of time there 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.269
 do not do an important test but what 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.870
 for me a rarity is that is 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:49.989
 that he will be a new one next week 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:53.050
 get top 10 pokémon from type dragon 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:55.239
 be the word in won a week 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:58.150
 then you get your poker radio 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.860
 and I do not try two videos then 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.640
 to do that in those weeks 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.500
 Sorry but I will 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.850
 try these two weeks 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.200
 a bit to produce with it 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.610
 in the third week again in the video 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.190
 and then I get a little bit 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.510
 can keep over water from videos because 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.410
 I will be an important one again 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.210
 math work 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.980
 I think that should be clear now 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.470
 I just wanted to inform you because 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.880
 I can not just spend a month 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.250
 do not do any videos and do not even do it 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.470
 explain why that is so yes 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.700
 I hope the video entitled I hope 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.460
 you have a little bit more now 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.110
 understanding what decker does what exactly 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.820
 that happens and what exactly maybe 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.290
 I'll tell you, I'll tell you 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.320
 personally, I am incredibly excited 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:37.420
 the poker radio and as a small spoiler 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.920
 because it is now for you once about 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.570
 do not want to know should switch away 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.090
 but as boiler what from the next parade 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.350
 come first is easy as 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.960
 sorry for that as long as nothing 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.420
 I want to be the seventh generation 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.450
 Talk to a guest and about it 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:53.860
 which then talk exactly what poker radio 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.870
 everything at 8 o'clock all sorts 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.880
 Exact matters to explain I then anyway 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.590
 inforadio 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:03.490
 So then you 're just sorry 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:05.350
 and see you in a week's top 10 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.920
