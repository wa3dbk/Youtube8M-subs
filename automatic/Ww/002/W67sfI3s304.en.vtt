Stillaguamish<00:00:02.580> River<00:00:02.760> there<00:00:03.720> are<00:00:03.870> three

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
Stillaguamish River there are three

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.160 
Stillaguamish River there are three
types<00:00:04.620> of<00:00:04.890> areas<00:00:05.160> where<00:00:05.819> gold<00:00:06.210> can<00:00:06.660> be<00:00:06.810> found

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
types of areas where gold can be found

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.850 
types of areas where gold can be found
the<00:00:08.160> first<00:00:08.400> is<00:00:08.760> in<00:00:08.940> bedrock<00:00:09.389> crevices<00:00:10.080> the

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
the first is in bedrock crevices the

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.310 
the first is in bedrock crevices the
second<00:00:11.370> in<00:00:11.610> tree<00:00:12.059> roots<00:00:12.090> as<00:00:12.809> they<00:00:12.990> cross

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
second in tree roots as they cross

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.390 
second in tree roots as they cross
active<00:00:13.740> areas<00:00:14.700> of<00:00:15.030> river<00:00:15.330> flow<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.920> third

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
active areas of river flow and the third

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.019 
active areas of river flow and the third
is<00:00:17.699> in<00:00:17.940> moss<00:00:19.070> so<00:00:20.070> what<00:00:20.310> we<00:00:20.460> will<00:00:20.580> talk<00:00:20.850> about

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
is in moss so what we will talk about

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.200 
is in moss so what we will talk about
here<00:00:21.779> is<00:00:21.930> recovering<00:00:22.590> gold<00:00:22.890> from<00:00:23.490> moss<00:00:23.789> and

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
here is recovering gold from moss and

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.939 
here is recovering gold from moss and
I'll<00:00:24.750> show<00:00:25.019> you<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.470> technique<00:00:26.010> I<00:00:26.279> use<00:00:27.949> watch

require more dirt to live ideally this
is<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.710> best<00:01:50.100> Moss<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:51.360> prospect<00:01:53.540> this<00:01:54.540> type

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
is the best Moss to prospect this type

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.950 
is the best Moss to prospect this type
of<00:01:54.899> moss<00:01:55.259> is<00:01:55.649> called<00:01:55.950> River<00:01:56.790> feather<00:01:57.240> moss<00:01:57.540> and

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
of moss is called River feather moss and

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.819 
of moss is called River feather moss and
also<00:01:58.950> prospects<00:01:59.549> very<00:02:00.000> nicely<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.810> don't<00:02:01.560> see

also prospects very nicely you don't see
too<00:02:02.159> much<00:02:02.369> of<00:02:02.579> this<00:02:02.790> along<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.780> river<00:02:03.960> though

too much of this along the river though

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.550 
too much of this along the river though
moss<00:02:06.899> removes<00:02:07.500> far<00:02:07.920> easier<00:02:08.280> wet<00:02:08.970> than<00:02:09.450> dry<00:02:09.780> so

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
moss removes far easier wet than dry so

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.490 
moss removes far easier wet than dry so
during<00:02:11.009> midsummer<00:02:11.310> I<00:02:12.000> pre<00:02:12.629> wet<00:02:12.900> the

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
dump it all back in at one time I think

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.340 
dump it all back in at one time I think
that<00:02:48.630> makes<00:02:49.110> more<00:02:49.410> ecologic<00:02:50.040> sense<00:02:51.140> when<00:02:52.140> you

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
that makes more ecologic sense when you

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.400 
that makes more ecologic sense when you
