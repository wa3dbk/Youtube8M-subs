00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.100
- You and Portia--I think we
talked about this before--

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.733
You and Portia grew up near
each other in Australia.

00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:07.333
- In the same country.
- Yeah--in the same country.

00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:08.433
[laughter]

00:00:08.433 --> 00:00:09.433
- There's not many of us.

00:00:09.433 --> 00:00:11.200
- Did you see each other often?

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.700
- Yeah, "Hello!"
- Yeah.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.066
- Yeah, in the same--
- No, you were in Melbourne.

00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:15.100
Right?
- Yeah, that's right.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.400
- And then you moved to Sydney.
- Yes.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.600
Away from the spiders,
the sharks, the snakes.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.033
- Aren't they everywhere?

00:00:20.033 --> 00:00:23.966
There really are the most deadly
spiders and snakes anywhere--

00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:27.533
- Well, no, we have more deadly
snakes than people, actually,

00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:28.766
so it is, you know.

00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:30.866
But there--I was talking to
someone earlier--

00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.100
- She doesn't mean by
"deadly people,"

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.366
she means by--just "people."

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:34.633
- We have a lot of
deadly people too.

00:00:34.633 --> 00:00:36.300
- Yes, but more snakes.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.300
- I can't--look, I still can't--
It's a year later

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.100
and I still can't string
a sentence together.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.233
- [laughs]
- Yes.

00:00:42.233 --> 00:00:44.066
No, but actually,
I was speaking to someone,

00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:46.900
and they're all very frightened
of the funnel-web spider,

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.733
which I think if you--if you get
bitten, you've got 20 minutes.

00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:54.400
And so I moved to Melbourne,
away from the sharks,

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.833
to Sydney, to the place where
the kids in the neighborhood

00:00:58.833 --> 00:01:02.666
used to collect funnel webs--
'cause they live in sandstone--

00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:05.066
and then we buy a little place
in the country,

00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:07.100
and there's an even more
poisonous spider

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.566
called the Blue Mountain
funnel-web,

00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:10.633
and I think you've got about
seven minutes

00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:11.800
to get to the hospital.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.233
I know, it's terrifying.
- Wow.

00:01:13.233 --> 00:01:15.333
- I was in western Australia

00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:18.966
filming this television series
years and years ago,

00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:20.466
and there was a thing that
looked like,

00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:23.466
you know, a Christmas beetle,
and I went up towards it,

00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:25.100
and it reared up and went...
[snarls]

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.566
[laughter]
I mean, they are really--

00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:27.566
I--I'm not just saying--

00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:28.733
- Well, that was probably
like a--

00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:30.800
like a wolf or something,
that probably--

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.433
It may not have been a spider.
It may have been something else.

00:01:33.433 --> 00:01:34.433
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

00:01:34.433 --> 00:01:35.733
- A dingo.
- Yes, maybe.

00:01:35.733 --> 00:01:36.800
[laughter]

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.300
Maybe it was a dingo.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.833
We're back with Cate Blanchett.

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:43.533
Playing the wicked, evil
stepmother in "Cinderella,"

00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:46.066
which must have been
a little fun, to play that.

00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:47.233
- A big stretch for me.
- Yeah.

00:01:47.233 --> 00:01:48.800
- Big, big stretch.
- Uh-huh.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.633
- [giggles]
- No, it would be fun to play

00:01:50.633 --> 00:01:53.633
somebody like that, because,
you know, you're not that.

00:01:53.633 --> 00:01:55.366
- I'm not young and beautiful.

00:01:55.366 --> 00:01:57.166
Well, there's--there was
a funny moment, actually,

00:01:57.166 --> 00:01:59.366
when I said to some friends
that I was,

00:01:59.366 --> 00:02:01.400
you know, in the live-action
"Cinderella,"

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.400
and they had a very sort of
awkward pause when they really

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.866
wanted to say "You're
a little old, aren't you?"

00:02:07.866 --> 00:02:10.533
It's a bit "What Happened to
Baby Jane?", you know.

00:02:10.533 --> 00:02:13.200
But, yeah, so, I didn't get
offered that part.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.700
- No, you played something el--
- I took what I could.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.133
- You--no, you took a good part,
but I'll tell you,

00:02:17.133 --> 00:02:19.600
the clothing was beautiful,

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.566
but, man, that looked
uncomfortable.

00:02:21.566 --> 00:02:25.100
- It was--look, I didn't have it
as bad as Lily did.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.666
I mean, she was--
in the ball scene,

00:02:26.666 --> 00:02:29.966
she's cinched where--
got a 17-inch waist.

00:02:29.966 --> 00:02:31.633
She could barely breathe--

00:02:31.633 --> 00:02:33.366
in this one--
and she and Richard

00:02:33.366 --> 00:02:36.200
had about 100 layers of wool on,
and they had to dance.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.333
it was like--they're like
Torvil and Dean on ice.

00:02:38.333 --> 00:02:40.400
You know, it was really,
really athletic.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.400
- Wow.
- And Helena had these dresses,

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.333
the--as the fairy godmother,

00:02:44.333 --> 00:02:46.866
and she literally needed
some guy to plug her in.

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:48.800
It was covered in LED lights,
so...

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.600
It was a bit hard to eat,
to go to the bathroom--

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.766
- Yeah, I was gonna say--
- To breathe.

00:02:51.766 --> 00:02:53.066
- Anything--
- Other than that, it was fine.

00:02:53.066 --> 00:02:54.233
- Other than that.
But it's a beautiful thing

00:02:54.233 --> 00:02:55.633
to look at, it's really fun.

00:02:55.633 --> 00:02:57.400
You've worked with a lot
of talented actors,

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.200
and I thought we'd play a game.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.800
You've kissed a lot of people,

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.733
and we're going to show you
lips, and we're gonna see--

00:03:02.733 --> 00:03:04.766
- Oh, it's not asses,
we're looking at lips.

00:03:04.766 --> 00:03:05.866
- Yes.
- Okay.

00:03:05.866 --> 00:03:07.433
[laughter]

00:03:07.433 --> 00:03:11.866
- Would--would you rather--
which do you identify with more?

00:03:11.866 --> 00:03:14.166
[laughter]
- We'll do--let's do the lips.

00:03:14.166 --> 00:03:16.166
- All right, let's do the lips.
- It's a family show.

00:03:16.166 --> 00:03:18.366
- 'Cause we don't have a lot of
photos of asses around here.

00:03:18.366 --> 00:03:20.133
We don't--
- I don't know, you could get--

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:21.133
you could get some.

00:03:21.133 --> 00:03:22.333
- Just have 'em on file.

00:03:22.333 --> 00:03:24.266
Well, I will, after this.

00:03:24.266 --> 00:03:25.566
[laughter]
Clearly.

00:03:25.566 --> 00:03:28.266
You want to see my P.A.'s asses.
- Yeah.

00:03:28.266 --> 00:03:29.633
[laughter]

00:03:29.633 --> 00:03:32.433
- All right, let's take a look
at the first lips.

00:03:32.433 --> 00:03:33.433
Do you know who that is?

00:03:33.433 --> 00:03:35.233
- Leo DiCaprio.
- Is it?

00:03:35.233 --> 00:03:36.400
- Yes!

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.033
- You are so right!
[bell dings]

00:03:38.033 --> 00:03:40.933
[cheers and applause]

00:03:40.933 --> 00:03:43.100
- Do I get--do I get $10,000
if I win?

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.033
- Yes.
And you'll go on vacation.

00:03:45.033 --> 00:03:46.633
- Okay.
- To Spice Island.

00:03:46.633 --> 00:03:47.633
Um, who's that?

00:03:47.633 --> 00:03:50.766
- Oh, that's George Clooney.

00:03:50.766 --> 00:03:52.033
(woman off-stage) Alec Baldwin.
- Is it?

00:03:52.033 --> 00:03:53.833
- It is?
- No, I don't think it is.

00:03:53.833 --> 00:03:56.400
- Oh, my God, it's Alec Baldwin.
[buzzer]

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.800
- I was gonna guess that.
- You were?

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.633
Have you kissed him?
- No, I have not kissed him.

00:03:59.633 --> 00:04:01.400
- But have you kissed his ass?
- Uh, no.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.533
[laughter]

00:04:02.533 --> 00:04:04.200
I have not.
- Ooh, I'm not telling.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.466
- Have you kissed his ass?
- I'm not telling.

00:04:05.466 --> 00:04:07.233
- All right.
[laughter]

00:04:07.233 --> 00:04:11.000
Let's see some other lips.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.600
Hmm.
- Who is that?

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.400
[laughter]

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.733
- Yep.
[loud laughter]

00:04:15.733 --> 00:04:16.733
[buzzer]

00:04:16.733 --> 00:04:18.766
- Did I--did I kiss Owen?

00:04:18.766 --> 00:04:20.333
- I'm not going to show you
any more lips.

00:04:20.333 --> 00:04:21.733
I'm scared
what you're gonna say.

00:04:21.733 --> 00:04:23.100
[laughter]

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.100
Um--
- That's Russell.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.833
Is that Russell--I think
you're right on that one.

00:04:26.833 --> 00:04:28.000
I agree with you.
[bell dings]

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.066
All right, so here--
I have a gift for you.

00:04:30.066 --> 00:04:31.733
I have some Ellen underwear,

00:04:31.733 --> 00:04:33.900
and my friends, my P.A.s,
brought them to you.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.166
Where are you guys?

00:04:35.166 --> 00:04:37.533
[cheers and applause]

00:04:37.533 --> 00:04:44.433
["Pony" by Ginuwine plays]

00:04:44.433 --> 00:04:45.900
- Thank you.
- [speaks indistinctly]

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.500
- Oh!
Oh, thank you.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.766
Thank you.

00:04:50.766 --> 00:04:53.500
[laughter]

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.866
This is so nice!

00:04:54.866 --> 00:04:56.600
- It goes with your stripe
on your--

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.500
- It does!
- It's fantastic.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.933
[cheers and applause]

00:05:03.933 --> 00:05:06.333
- It looks good 'cause it works
with the yellow there.

00:05:06.333 --> 00:05:08.266
See?
Like that.

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:09.900
- Whoa.
[cheers and applause]

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.033
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

00:05:11.033 --> 00:05:12.966
- "Cinderella" opens in theaters
next Friday.

00:05:12.966 --> 00:05:15.200
We'll be right back.
Cate Blanchett.
