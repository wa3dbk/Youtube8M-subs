this<00:00:25.380> was<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.640> exciting<00:00:26.640> little<00:00:26.910> app<00:00:27.090> for<00:00:27.359> me<00:00:27.480> I

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
this was a exciting little app for me I

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.460 
this was a exciting little app for me I
got<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:28.949> tried<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.340> out<00:00:29.429> this<00:00:29.640> morning

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
got it and I tried it out this morning

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.319 
got it and I tried it out this morning
overall<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.740> thought<00:00:32.219> it<00:00:32.369> was<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.550> fun<00:00:33.090> project

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
overall I thought it was a fun project

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.069 
overall I thought it was a fun project
and<00:00:33.840> definitely<00:00:34.710> worth<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.460> two<00:00:36.420> dollars<00:00:36.780> and

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
and definitely worth the two dollars and

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.959 
and definitely worth the two dollars and
ninety-nine<00:00:37.680> since<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.219> believe<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:38.700> paid

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
ninety-nine since I believe that I paid

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.100 
ninety-nine since I believe that I paid
for<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.350> but<00:00:40.790> it's<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.850> little<00:00:42.090> bit<00:00:42.239> harder<00:00:42.870> than

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
for it but it's a little bit harder than

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.200 
for it but it's a little bit harder than
they<00:00:44.040> make<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.370> seem<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.820> put<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.059> together

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
they make it seem to put it together

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.060 
they make it seem to put it together
they<00:00:45.960> were<00:00:46.020> like<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.379> know<00:00:46.500> all<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.739> need<00:00:46.890> is

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
they were like you know all you need is

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.119 
they were like you know all you need is
paper<00:00:47.489> scissors<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.450> glue<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.989> that's<00:00:49.739> sort

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
paper scissors and glue and that's sort

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.610 
paper scissors and glue and that's sort
of<00:00:50.190> right<00:00:50.399> but<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:51.469> cutting<00:00:52.469> was

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
of right but the cutting was

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.069 
of right but the cutting was
self-explanatory<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.820> even<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.600> folding

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
self-explanatory and even the folding

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.869 
self-explanatory and even the folding
where<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.379> ran<00:00:55.770> into<00:00:55.920> trouble<00:00:56.190> was<00:00:56.550> glowing

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
where I ran into trouble was glowing

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.430 
where I ran into trouble was glowing
like<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.510> could<00:00:57.629> have<00:00:57.719> been<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.899> type<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.109> glue

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
like it could have been the type of glue

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.060 
like it could have been the type of glue
but<00:00:59.160> that's<00:00:59.699> where<00:01:00.440> things<00:01:01.440> started<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.890> kind

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
but that's where things started to kind

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.670 
but that's where things started to kind
of<00:01:02.129> fall<00:01:02.340> apart<00:01:02.520> for<00:01:03.000> me<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.270> am<00:01:03.870> ended<00:01:04.589> up

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
of fall apart for me I am ended up

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.530 
of fall apart for me I am ended up
having<00:01:04.979> like<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.189> just<00:01:05.610> regular<00:01:06.000> glue<00:01:06.240> stick

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
having like the just regular glue stick

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.140 
having like the just regular glue stick
just<00:01:06.780> wasn't<00:01:07.080> doing<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.409> for<00:01:07.470> me<00:01:07.760> but<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:08.790> ended

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
just wasn't doing it for me but I ended

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.690 
just wasn't doing it for me but I ended
up<00:01:09.530> getting<00:01:10.530> some<00:01:10.860> different<00:01:11.189> type<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.340> glue

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
up getting some different type of glue

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.020 
up getting some different type of glue
and<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:12.540> kind<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:12.990> got<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.409> stick<00:01:13.710> together

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
and I kind of got it to stick together

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.039 
and I kind of got it to stick together
enough<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.150> be<00:01:15.240> able<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.450> take<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.659> picture<00:01:16.020> and

know it's nothing that you would take

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.539

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
desk so I figure that I'm going to retry

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.910 
desk so I figure that I'm going to retry
it<00:01:29.490> again<00:01:29.850> this<00:01:30.000> weekend<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.630> see<00:01:31.560> if<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.770> can

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
it again this weekend and see if I can

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.800 
it again this weekend and see if I can
get<00:01:32.040> some<00:01:32.100> better<00:01:32.460> results<00:01:33.060> on<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:33.570> time

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
get some better results on this time

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.840 
get some better results on this time
with<00:01:34.560> some<00:01:34.710> better<00:01:34.979> glue<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.490> would<00:01:35.640> like<00:01:35.820> to

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
with some better glue I would like to

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.330 
with some better glue I would like to
know<00:01:36.000> what<00:01:36.270> kind<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.540> glue<00:01:36.780> they<00:01:37.590> use<00:01:37.890> make

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
know what kind of glue they use make

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.920 
know what kind of glue they use make
theirs<00:01:38.610> look<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.090> cute<00:01:39.390> but<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.750> course

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
theirs look so cute but of course

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.450 
theirs look so cute but of course
they're<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.259> ones<00:01:40.409> who<00:01:40.560> made<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.979> appt<00:01:41.100> so

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
they're the ones who made the appt so

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.580 
they're the ones who made the appt so
I'm<00:01:42.030> definitely<00:01:42.299> thinking<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:43.049> results<00:01:43.470> may

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
I'm definitely thinking that results may

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.670 
I'm definitely thinking that results may
vary<00:01:43.619> depending<00:01:44.310> on<00:01:44.310> your<00:01:44.610> glue<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.360> your

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
vary depending on your glue and your

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.960 
vary depending on your glue and your
folding<00:01:46.680> capabilities<00:01:47.460> because<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.790> want<00:01:47.939> to

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
folding capabilities because you want to

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.700 
folding capabilities because you want to
make<00:01:48.090> sure<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.360> fold<00:01:48.750> directly<00:01:49.259> on<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.530> line

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
make sure you fold directly on the line

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.069 
make sure you fold directly on the line
but<00:01:50.430> as<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:50.970> can<00:01:51.090> see<00:01:51.329> by<00:01:51.570> looking<00:01:51.689> at<00:01:51.930> my

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
but as you can see by looking at my

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.230 
but as you can see by looking at my
pictures<00:01:52.500> that's<00:01:52.829> what<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:52.979> got<00:01:53.189> first<00:01:53.490> try<00:01:53.850> and

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
pictures that's what I got first try and

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.840 
pictures that's what I got first try and
I<00:01:54.420> think<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:55.100> tried<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.369> couple<00:01:56.399> more

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
I think that tried it a couple more

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.600 
I think that tried it a couple more
times<00:01:57.149> will<00:01:58.130> probably<00:01:59.130> get<00:01:59.250> me<00:01:59.399> better

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
times will probably get me better

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.160 
times will probably get me better
results<00:02:00.149> but<00:02:00.329> then<00:02:00.420> that's<00:02:00.570> also<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:01.020> know

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
results but then that's also you know

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.319 
results but then that's also you know
wasting<00:02:01.649> more<00:02:01.829> printer<00:02:02.340> ink<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.880> that's<00:02:03.090> not

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
wasting more printer ink and that's not

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.530 
wasting more printer ink and that's not
fun<00:02:03.630> but<00:02:04.619> so<00:02:04.799> like<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:05.520> said<00:02:05.579> overall<00:02:05.969> I<00:02:06.119> like

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
fun but so like I said overall I like

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.050 
fun but so like I said overall I like
