00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
where as you can see my CNC machine has

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.950 
where as you can see my CNC machine has
been<00:00:17.400> set<00:00:17.640> up<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:18.359> cut<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:19.440> top<00:00:19.650> lead<00:00:19.890> for<00:00:20.960> an

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
been set up to cut the top lead for an

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.980 
been set up to cut the top lead for an
archetype<00:00:22.380> guitar<00:00:23.240> as<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.360> can<00:00:24.510> see<00:00:24.690> here

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
archetype guitar as you can see here

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.020 
archetype guitar as you can see here
it's<00:00:25.560> beginning<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.690> cut<00:00:27.690> the<00:00:27.980> under<00:00:28.980> side<00:00:29.820> if

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:30.030 
it's beginning to cut the under side if

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.930 
it's beginning to cut the under side if
you<00:00:30.119> will<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.810> top<00:00:30.990> plate<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.759> you'll<00:00:32.759> see

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
you will of the top plate and you'll see

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.590 
you will of the top plate and you'll see
here<00:00:33.120> in<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.329> minute<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:34.140> I've<00:00:34.260> also<00:00:35.300> will<00:00:36.300> use

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
here in a minute that I've also will use

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.259 
here in a minute that I've also will use
a<00:00:36.629> method<00:00:37.109> that<00:00:37.440> will<00:00:38.190> allow<00:00:38.399> me<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.609> integrate

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:39.269 
a method that will allow me to integrate

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:42.529 
a method that will allow me to integrate
the<00:00:39.449> braces<00:00:40.489> directly<00:00:41.489> into<00:00:41.909> the<00:00:42.030> top<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:42.449> I'll

00:00:42.529 --> 00:00:42.539 
the braces directly into the top so I'll

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:44.299 
the braces directly into the top so I'll
have<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.899> separately<00:00:43.260> clue<00:00:43.559> prices<00:00:44.010> on<00:00:44.159> there

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
have to separately clue prices on there

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.430 
have to separately clue prices on there
and<00:00:44.460> you'll<00:00:44.550> see<00:00:44.729> what<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:44.879> mean

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
and you'll see what I mean

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.599 
and you'll see what I mean
so<00:00:46.440> as<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.649> can<00:00:46.769> see<00:00:46.829> here<00:00:47.159> I'm<00:00:47.280> doing<00:00:47.399> a

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:47.609 
so as you can see here I'm doing a

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:51.169 
so as you can see here I'm doing a
roughing<00:00:47.999> pass<00:00:48.379> with<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.409> 3/8<00:00:49.889> of<00:00:50.069> an<00:00:50.219> inch<00:00:50.309> mill

00:00:51.169 --> 00:00:51.179 
roughing pass with a 3/8 of an inch mill

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:53.689 
roughing pass with a 3/8 of an inch mill
and<00:00:51.929> you<00:00:51.960> can<00:00:52.559> also<00:00:52.889> begin<00:00:53.249> to<00:00:53.280> see<00:00:53.550> the

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
and you can also begin to see the

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.299 
and you can also begin to see the
integrated<00:00:54.210> braces<00:00:54.659> in<00:00:55.559> their<00:00:55.769> rough<00:00:55.949> state

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
integrated braces in their rough state

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.520 
integrated braces in their rough state
those<00:00:57.299> will<00:00:57.510> be<00:00:57.600> cleaned<00:00:57.899> out<00:00:58.049> with<00:00:58.499> a

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
those will be cleaned out with a

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:07.530 
those will be cleaned out with a
finishing<00:00:58.979> pass

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.810 

is<00:01:08.540> a<00:01:08.600> shadow<00:01:08.990> block<00:01:09.560> 3<00:01:09.860> actually<00:01:10.159> running<00:01:10.610> the

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
is a shadow block 3 actually running the

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.120 
is a shadow block 3 actually running the
g-code<00:01:11.210> this<00:01:11.810> was<00:01:11.960> around<00:01:12.170> 30,000<00:01:12.829> lines<00:01:12.950> of

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
g-code this was around 30,000 lines of

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.760 
g-code this was around 30,000 lines of
code<00:01:13.340> and<00:01:13.729> as<00:01:14.600> you<00:01:14.720> saw<00:01:14.899> there<00:01:15.140> we're<00:01:15.380> dividing

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
code and as you saw there we're dividing

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:37.840 
code and as you saw there we're dividing
about<00:01:15.950> 130<00:01:16.549> inches<00:01:16.700> a<00:01:16.880> minute<00:01:36.429> as<00:01:37.429> you<00:01:37.549> can<00:01:37.700> see

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
about 130 inches a minute as you can see

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.279 
about 130 inches a minute as you can see
the<00:01:37.970> machine<00:01:38.240> now<00:01:38.360> is<00:01:38.509> actually<00:01:38.690> bringing

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
the machine now is actually bringing

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:42.669 
the machine now is actually bringing
down<00:01:39.440> those<00:01:39.709> braces<00:01:40.039> into<00:01:41.140> final<00:01:42.140> dimensions

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:42.679 
down those braces into final dimensions

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:44.580 
down those braces into final dimensions
so<00:01:42.950> I<00:01:42.979> left<00:01:43.310> about<00:01:43.490> an<00:01:43.700> eighth<00:01:43.880> of<00:01:44.030> an<00:01:44.179> inch

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
so I left about an eighth of an inch

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:52.120 
so I left about an eighth of an inch
oversized<00:01:45.590> for<00:01:45.920> final<00:01:46.340> tuning<00:01:46.670> boom<00:01:50.740> and<00:01:51.740> here

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
oversized for final tuning boom and here

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.730 
oversized for final tuning boom and here
you<00:01:52.280> can<00:01:52.399> see<00:01:52.580> the<00:01:52.700> finishing<00:01:53.060> passes<00:01:53.740> here

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
you can see the finishing passes here

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.089 
you can see the finishing passes here
I'm<00:01:54.860> using<00:01:55.039> a<00:01:55.250> 3/8<00:01:55.610> of<00:01:55.700> an<00:01:55.819> inch<00:01:55.909> ball<00:01:56.270> nose<00:01:56.509> bit

00:01:57.089 --> 00:01:57.099 
I'm using a 3/8 of an inch ball nose bit

00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:00.940 
I'm using a 3/8 of an inch ball nose bit
and<00:01:58.099> as<00:01:58.220> you<00:01:58.340> can<00:01:58.429> see<00:01:58.490> it<00:01:58.880> leaves<00:01:59.179> a<00:01:59.390> very<00:01:59.950> soft

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
and as you can see it leaves a very soft

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:01.389 
and as you can see it leaves a very soft
finish

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
finish

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.999 
finish
I<00:02:01.520> believe<00:02:01.789> my<00:02:01.909> step<00:02:02.209> over<00:02:02.539> was<00:02:02.689> around<00:02:03.009> 0.05

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
I believe my step over was around 0.05

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.639 
I believe my step over was around 0.05
or<00:02:04.039> something<00:02:04.490> like<00:02:04.580> that<00:02:04.640> a<00:02:05.349> little<00:02:06.349> bit<00:02:06.500> of

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
or something like that a little bit of

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:08.529 
or something like that a little bit of
sanding<00:02:07.039> after<00:02:07.310> that<00:02:07.459> all<00:02:08.000> those<00:02:08.209> tooling

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
sanding after that all those tooling

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.569 
sanding after that all those tooling
marks<00:02:08.569> will<00:02:09.049> basically<00:02:09.229> disappear<00:02:12.340> and<00:02:13.340> we

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:13.579 
marks will basically disappear and we

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:15.220 
marks will basically disappear and we
actually<00:02:14.060> go<00:02:14.180> on<00:02:14.269> ahead<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:14.630> do<00:02:14.690> a<00:02:14.720> profile

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
actually go on ahead and do a profile

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.720 
actually go on ahead and do a profile
cut<00:02:15.440> on<00:02:15.560> those<00:02:15.680> braces<00:02:16.070> as<00:02:16.220> well<00:02:16.370> as<00:02:16.489> you<00:02:16.609> can

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
cut on those braces as well as you can

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.180 
cut on those braces as well as you can
see<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:17.840> leave<00:02:18.049> a<00:02:18.079> very<00:02:18.380> smooth<00:02:18.680> finish<00:02:18.709> on

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
see to leave a very smooth finish on

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.059 
see to leave a very smooth finish on
them<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:20.870> basically<00:02:21.260> requires<00:02:21.680> only<00:02:21.890> minimal

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
them the basically requires only minimal

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.210 
them the basically requires only minimal
work<00:02:22.959> after<00:02:23.959> to<00:02:24.140> basically<00:02:24.560> bring<00:02:24.950> them<00:02:25.100> into

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
work after to basically bring them into

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.630 
work after to basically bring them into
final<00:02:25.609> dimensions<00:02:26.120> and<00:02:26.269> final<00:02:26.600> tuning<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:27.640> as

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
final dimensions and final tuning and as

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.550 
final dimensions and final tuning and as
you<00:02:28.760> can<00:02:28.910> see<00:02:29.060> here<00:02:29.329> here<00:02:29.569> is<00:02:29.600> the<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:30.319> bottom

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
you can see here here is the the bottom

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.280 
you can see here here is the the bottom
mark<00:02:30.769> should<00:02:31.069> pretty<00:02:31.310> much<00:02:31.400> the<00:02:31.730> bottom<00:02:32.290> part

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
mark should pretty much the bottom part

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.009 
mark should pretty much the bottom part
of<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:33.530> plate<00:02:33.769> complete<00:02:34.489> it<00:02:34.840> next<00:02:35.840> will

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
of the plate complete it next will

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.710 
of the plate complete it next will
actually<00:02:36.530> start<00:02:36.940> with<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:38.000> top<00:02:38.269> and<00:02:38.540> you'll

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
actually start with the top and you'll

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.670 
actually start with the top and you'll
see<00:02:38.930> that

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.160 

again<00:02:42.400> roughing<00:02:42.879> passes<00:02:43.299> for<00:02:43.450> the<00:02:43.569> top<00:02:43.750> after

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
again roughing passes for the top after

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.059 
again roughing passes for the top after
we<00:02:44.439> flipped<00:02:44.739> the<00:02:45.480> body<00:02:46.480> over<00:02:46.840> as<00:02:47.590> you<00:02:47.769> can<00:02:47.920> see

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
we flipped the body over as you can see

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.449 
we flipped the body over as you can see
here<00:02:48.310> using<00:02:48.879> a<00:02:49.060> very<00:02:49.239> large<00:02:49.480> step<00:02:49.720> over<00:02:50.459> but

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
here using a very large step over but

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.039 
here using a very large step over but
again<00:02:51.730> which<00:02:51.909> is<00:02:52.030> when<00:02:52.180> I<00:02:52.209> remove<00:02:52.540> my<00:02:52.689> tarry<00:02:52.900> go

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
again which is when I remove my tarry go

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:56.460 
again which is when I remove my tarry go
as<00:02:53.200> smoothly<00:02:53.409> as<00:02:53.620> possible<00:02:54.069> and<00:02:54.730> then<00:02:55.290> we<00:02:56.290> will

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
as smoothly as possible and then we will

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.679 
as smoothly as possible and then we will
proceed<00:02:56.709> with<00:02:57.189> finishing<00:02:57.549> passes<00:02:58.000> and<00:02:58.299> you'll

00:02:58.679 --> 00:02:58.689 
proceed with finishing passes and you'll

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:07.080 
proceed with finishing passes and you'll
see<00:02:58.900> those<00:02:59.079> as<00:02:59.260> well<00:03:05.519> and<00:03:06.519> here's<00:03:06.849> the<00:03:06.970> machine

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
see those as well and here's the machine

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.770 
see those as well and here's the machine
doing<00:03:07.450> finishing<00:03:07.689> passes<00:03:08.230> on<00:03:08.379> the<00:03:08.530> top

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.330 

finishing<00:03:13.780> passes<00:03:14.139> I'm<00:03:14.260> doing<00:03:14.470> at<00:03:14.590> around<00:03:14.769> 140

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
finishing passes I'm doing at around 140

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.270 
finishing passes I'm doing at around 140
inches<00:03:15.670> a<00:03:15.700> minute<00:03:16.530> and<00:03:17.530> I<00:03:17.650> was<00:03:17.799> cutting<00:03:18.040> around

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
inches a minute and I was cutting around

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.530 
inches a minute and I was cutting around
believe<00:03:19.239> 90<00:03:19.599> inches<00:03:19.900> a<00:03:19.930> minute<00:03:21.299> as<00:03:22.299> you<00:03:22.359> can

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
believe 90 inches a minute as you can

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.020 
believe 90 inches a minute as you can
see<00:03:22.690> here<00:03:22.870> we're<00:03:23.019> cutting<00:03:23.290> out<00:03:23.379> the<00:03:23.530> F<00:03:23.650> holes

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
see here we're cutting out the F holes

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.030 
see here we're cutting out the F holes
and<00:03:25.030> at<00:03:25.780> this<00:03:25.930> point<00:03:26.170> the<00:03:26.379> top<00:03:26.530> is<00:03:26.709> pretty<00:03:26.920> much

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
and at this point the top is pretty much

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.770 
and at this point the top is pretty much
alive<00:03:27.400> is<00:03:27.549> actually<00:03:27.909> vibrating<00:03:28.450> as<00:03:28.540> you<00:03:28.629> can

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
alive is actually vibrating as you can

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:29.910 
alive is actually vibrating as you can
see<00:03:28.900> there<00:03:29.079> from<00:03:29.200> the<00:03:29.379> vibrate

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
see there from the vibrate

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:36.840 
see there from the vibrate
does<00:03:30.099> no<00:03:30.370> vibrating<00:03:30.849> chips

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.520 

and<00:03:37.850> after<00:03:38.120> the<00:03:38.240> F<00:03:38.360> walls<00:03:38.570> are<00:03:38.750> done<00:03:38.900> we're

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
and after the F walls are done we're

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.840 
and after the F walls are done we're
actually<00:03:39.770> going<00:03:40.130> to<00:03:40.250> proceed<00:03:40.580> to<00:03:40.640> do<00:03:40.820> a

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
actually going to proceed to do a

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.740 
actually going to proceed to do a
profile<00:03:41.330> cut<00:03:41.630> to<00:03:42.730> cut<00:03:43.730> the<00:03:43.880> entire<00:03:44.180> top<00:03:44.510> out<00:03:44.720> of

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
profile cut to cut the entire top out of

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.270 
profile cut to cut the entire top out of
the<00:03:44.930> block<00:03:45.140> of<00:03:45.170> wood<00:03:45.320> and<00:03:45.650> you'll<00:03:45.920> see<00:03:46.130> that

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
the block of wood and you'll see that

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:57.280 
the block of wood and you'll see that
next<00:03:55.450> so<00:03:56.450> here's<00:03:56.630> the<00:03:56.720> machine<00:03:56.870> doing<00:03:57.170> a

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
next so here's the machine doing a

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.680 
next so here's the machine doing a
profile<00:03:57.680> cutter<00:03:57.980> the<00:03:58.970> Philippe<00:03:59.270> this<00:03:59.420> is<00:03:59.540> with

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
profile cutter the Philippe this is with

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:10.140 
profile cutter the Philippe this is with
a<00:03:59.840> 1/4<00:04:00.470> of<00:04:00.500> an<00:04:00.710> inch<00:04:00.800> bill

I know you can really see it here
because<00:04:15.250> of<00:04:15.549> all<00:04:15.640> the<00:04:15.760> material<00:04:16.209> that's<00:04:16.389> on

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
because of all the material that's on

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.020 
because of all the material that's on
the<00:04:16.600> table<00:04:16.930> but<00:04:17.169> the<00:04:17.729> recurves<00:04:18.729> have<00:04:18.880> also

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
the table but the recurves have also

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.150 
the table but the recurves have also
been<00:04:19.299> cut<00:04:19.539> and<00:04:20.139> you'll<00:04:20.289> see<00:04:20.500> the<00:04:20.560> finished

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
been cut and you'll see the finished
