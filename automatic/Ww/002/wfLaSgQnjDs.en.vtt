short so the nail clipper has to be

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.389 
short so the nail clipper has to be
rounded<00:00:42.540> like<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.110> do<00:00:43.290> not<00:00:43.320> use<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.890> regular

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
rounded like that do not use a regular

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.250 
rounded like that do not use a regular
human<00:00:44.610> nail<00:00:45.000> or<00:00:45.239> toenail<00:00:45.570> clippers<00:00:45.960> it's

do it again so you want to get this

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.729 
do it again so you want to get this
rounded<00:00:54.420> one<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.870> kind<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.110> wraps<00:00:55.620> around

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
rounded one so it kind of wraps around
