one<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.320> those<00:00:16.379> great<00:00:16.710> myths<00:00:17.070> is<00:00:17.340> that<00:00:17.369> when<00:00:17.609> an

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
one of those great myths is that when an

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.880 
one of those great myths is that when an
aircraft<00:00:17.910> stalls<00:00:18.600> usually<00:00:19.529> think<00:00:19.710> it<00:00:19.800> has

aircraft stalls usually think it has

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.050 
aircraft stalls usually think it has
something<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.279> do<00:00:20.400> with<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.609> aircraft's

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
something to do with the aircraft's

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.700 
something to do with the aircraft's

aircraft's engine has everything to do

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.420

a stall not producing a stall happens
when<00:00:30.960> your<00:00:31.080> aircraft<00:00:31.650> reaches<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.160> critical

when your aircraft reaches a critical

when your aircraft reaches a critical
angle<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:33.329> attack<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.960> thus<00:00:34.469> foils<00:00:35.190> any<00:00:35.489> air

every wing at a given configuration will

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
which a wing stalls is not the same

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.590 
which a wing stalls is not the same
thing<00:01:00.899> as<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.469> angle<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:02.070> your<00:01:02.460> pitch<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:03.239> lot

thing as the angle of your pitch a lot
of<00:01:03.750> pilots<00:01:04.110> will<00:01:04.260> confuse<00:01:04.650> this<00:01:04.860> factor<00:01:05.309> and

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
of pilots will confuse this factor and

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.230 
of pilots will confuse this factor and
get<00:01:05.519> themselves<00:01:05.909> into<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.180> lot<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.479> trouble

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
get themselves into a lot of trouble

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.399 
get themselves into a lot of trouble
generally<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.450> can<00:01:09.570> tell<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.869> onset<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.260> a

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
generally you can tell the onset of a

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.929 
generally you can tell the onset of a
stall<00:01:10.680> by<00:01:10.950> having<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.310> high<00:01:11.460> angle<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:11.820> attack

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
stall by having a high angle of attack

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.420 
stall by having a high angle of attack
and<00:01:12.420> soon<00:01:13.260> your<00:01:13.619> aircraft<00:01:14.100> would<00:01:14.189> begin

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
and soon your aircraft would begin

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.190 
and soon your aircraft would begin
buffeting<00:01:14.939> or<00:01:15.090> shaking<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.630> little<00:01:15.750> bit<00:01:15.900> if

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
buffeting or shaking a little bit if

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.070 
buffeting or shaking a little bit if
your<00:01:16.680> aircraft<00:01:17.100> is<00:01:17.250> equipped<00:01:17.689> with<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.720> warning

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.210 
buzzer or a stall horn this stall buzzer
will<00:01:21.630> go<00:01:21.780> off<00:01:21.960> just<00:01:22.200> moments<00:01:22.799> before<00:01:22.830> your

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
will go off just moments before your

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.789 
will go off just moments before your
aircraft's<00:01:23.820> nose<00:01:23.939> drop<00:01:24.450> sharply<00:01:24.810> sending<00:01:25.680> you

aircraft's nose drop sharply sending you

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.249 
aircraft's nose drop sharply sending you
either<00:01:25.950> into<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.310> spin<00:01:26.729> or<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.060> direct<00:01:27.720> nose<00:01:27.990> down

either into a spin or a direct nose down

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.910 
either into a spin or a direct nose down
maneuver<00:01:28.860> straight<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.610> ground<00:01:30.920> to

maneuver straight to the ground to

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.039 
maneuver straight to the ground to
recover<00:01:32.250> from<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.549> stall<00:01:32.820> you'll<00:01:33.210> simply<00:01:33.450> nose

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
recover from a stall you'll simply nose

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.350 
recover from a stall you'll simply nose
over<00:01:34.350> your<00:01:34.500> aircraft<00:01:34.950> decreasing<00:01:35.850> its<00:01:35.939> angle

in mind all aircraft lose different
amounts<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:41.850> altitude<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:42.689> when<00:01:42.840> you're

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
amounts of altitude so when you're

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.899 
amounts of altitude so when you're
practicing<00:01:43.200> your<00:01:43.619> stall<00:01:43.979> recovery<00:01:44.159> make<00:01:44.880> sure

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
practicing your stall recovery make sure

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.399 
practicing your stall recovery make sure
you<00:01:45.180> have<00:01:45.329> quite<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.810> bit<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.079> altitude

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
you have quite a bit of altitude

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.050 
you have quite a bit of altitude
underneath<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:47.009> now<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.579> can<00:01:47.759> see<00:01:47.880> why<00:01:48.000> this

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
underneath you now you can see why this

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.429 
underneath you now you can see why this
would<00:01:48.299> be<00:01:48.390> important<00:01:48.869> because<00:01:48.930> when<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.259> do

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
would be important because when you do

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.440 
would be important because when you do
practice<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.130> you'll<00:01:50.640> notice<00:01:51.030> how<00:01:51.210> much

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
practice this you'll notice how much

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.870 
practice this you'll notice how much
altitude<00:01:51.689> your<00:01:52.140> aircraft<00:01:52.619> will<00:01:52.920> lose<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:53.759> it

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
altitude your aircraft will lose so it

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.510 
altitude your aircraft will lose so it
makes<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.180> especially<00:01:54.869> critical<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:56.100> always

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
makes it especially critical to always

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.160 
makes it especially critical to always
pay<00:01:56.700> attention<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:57.119> your<00:01:57.240> angle<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.659> attack<00:01:57.750> on

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
pay attention to your angle of attack on

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.090 
pay attention to your angle of attack on
landing<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.310> takeoffs
