00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.500
 this noise establishment this post 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.210
 extra is so welcome 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.519
 we are the only college of 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.460
 public department so who owns a 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.070
 internship and it's true that for about 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.289
 600 students plus time coverage 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.719
 of internat a single post of cpe was 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.270
 not enough a school life so been 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.590
 piloted led framed by the counselor 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.600
 principal education advisers 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.360
 in this case she's her manager 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.079
 educational assistants and they are 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.969
 both they have both the role of 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.110
 ensure maintenance of compliance 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.660
 rules of procedure and then a 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.590
 major role of animation of listened and 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.660
 student support 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.360
 so it's the rectorate that has accepted 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.760
 to attribute this cpe to the rector 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.829
 visiting academy this morning is 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.500
 satisfied with the good management of life 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.780
 college school seven jobs plus 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.000
 is part of the refoundation of the school 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.070
 thought by the government we have 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.049
 thought it's not about putting me 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.240
 means to put means so much 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.220
 that globally in the academy we 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.759
 have more means than in others 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.740
 academies 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.020
 does not mean having more means 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.439
 that his means are satisfactory but 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.060
 if we take the ratios we are less 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:30.360
 I would say disadvantaged than others for 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.479
 as much this regional distribution this 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.040
 regional average does not make sense to 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.840
 every place in a few places we 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.159
 need to increase the means this 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.740
 which means to go elsewhere 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.329
 according to the rector the department does 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.159
 knows no extreme violence in 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.950
 school environment there are still 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.470
 incivilities the cpe is so here to 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.100
 supervise these students and avoid everything 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.159
 overflow 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.289
 by my role it's basically so 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.539
 as in all institutions 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:58.340
 therefore ensure the safety of 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:00.569
 students 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.039
 I insist on doing this as in 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:04.770
 all the establishments and give so 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:07.140
 a structuring framework so that precisely 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.569
 the students from where she and cards in hand 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.190
 to succeed their future everything has been done 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.989
 here in the establishment for that I 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.840
 be well identified as a cpe to 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.840
 full share so they know where is my 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.390
 name my office he saab 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.950
 that's who can come to see me when 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.379
 they want me to be there a cpe to 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.540
 full-fledged college counts 45 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:29.549
 teachers the first cpe is in 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.230
 function for four years as to 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.970
 audrey so she starts her all 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.230
