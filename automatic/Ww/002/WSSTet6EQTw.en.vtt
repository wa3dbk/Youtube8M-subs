all right this is a first of all the
most<00:00:11.969> important<00:00:12.450> thing<00:00:12.599> is<00:00:12.719> this<00:00:12.870> folding

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
most important thing is this folding

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.220 
most important thing is this folding
skin<00:00:13.590> kayak<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:14.969> skin<00:00:15.210> on<00:00:15.240> frame<00:00:15.630> kayak<00:00:16.049> is

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
skin kayak and a skin on frame kayak is

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.080 
skin kayak and a skin on frame kayak is
it<00:00:16.379> kind<00:00:16.859> of<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:16.980> different<00:00:17.279> behavior<00:00:17.580> in<00:00:17.940> the

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
it kind of a different behavior in the

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.510 
it kind of a different behavior in the
water<00:00:18.300> than<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.570> rigid<00:00:19.050> kite<00:00:19.260> flexes<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.220> little

bit<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:21.720> folding<00:00:22.020> kayak<00:00:22.350> allows<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.740> to

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
bit and a folding kayak allows you to

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.240 
bit and a folding kayak allows you to
fold<00:00:23.279> them<00:00:23.430> back<00:00:23.460> put<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.390> in<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.570> bag<00:00:25.130> stick<00:00:26.130> it

there with this boat it has a although
it<00:00:59.370> has<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.520> lot<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.760> windage<00:01:00.180> with<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.109> fairly

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
it has a lot of windage with a fairly

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.349 
it has a lot of windage with a fairly
high<00:01:01.620> deck<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.160> handle<00:01:02.399> all<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.609> gear<00:01:02.850> with

high deck to handle all the gear with

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.570 
high deck to handle all the gear with
the<00:01:03.390> rudder<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:04.170> can<00:01:04.589> still<00:01:04.830> handle<00:01:05.040> just

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
the rudder you can still handle just

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:14.420 
the rudder you can still handle just
about<00:01:05.729> anything<00:01:12.170> well<00:01:13.170> there's<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.409> lot<00:01:13.560> to

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
about anything well there's a lot to

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.550 
about anything well there's a lot to
start<00:01:14.700> with<00:01:14.880> it's<00:01:15.150> an<00:01:15.330> aluminum<00:01:15.570> frame<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.470> you

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
start with it's an aluminum frame so you

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.469 
start with it's an aluminum frame so you
have<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.860> provide<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.400> lot<00:01:17.729> of<00:01:17.759> floatation

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
have to provide a lot of floatation

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.170 
have to provide a lot of floatation
because<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.049> frame<00:01:19.229> itself<00:01:19.500> doesn't<00:01:19.770> float

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
because the frame itself doesn't float

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.179 
because the frame itself doesn't float
but<00:01:21.180> there's<00:01:21.780> air<00:01:22.020> chambers<00:01:22.439> along<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.860> side

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
but there's air chambers along the side

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.929 
but there's air chambers along the side
and<00:01:23.780> they're<00:01:24.780> called<00:01:25.130> sponses<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.369> then<00:01:26.820> go

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
and they're called sponses and then go

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.730 
and they're called sponses and then go
from<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.240> bow<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.689> stern<00:01:27.780> on<00:01:28.200> on<00:01:28.409> both

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
from the bow to the stern on on both

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.850 
from the bow to the stern on on both
sides<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:30.000> there<00:01:30.930> they<00:01:31.229> stick<00:01:31.470> out<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.650> little

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
sides and there they stick out a little

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.200 
sides and there they stick out a little
bit<00:01:32.009> above<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.280> waterline<00:01:32.729> but<00:01:33.000> when<00:01:33.119> you

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
bit above the waterline but when you

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.090 
bit above the waterline but when you
lean<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.750> gives<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.110> stability<00:01:34.350> but<00:01:35.040> it

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
lean it it gives you stability but it

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.010 
lean it it gives you stability but it
also<00:01:35.280> gives<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.729> floatation<00:01:36.450> which<00:01:36.869> is

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
also gives you floatation which is

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.679 
also gives you floatation which is
wonderful<00:01:37.470> there's<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.189> sea<00:01:38.460> sock<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:39.479> can't

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
wonderful there's a sea sock you can't

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.240 
wonderful there's a sea sock you can't
really<00:01:39.869> see<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.409> from<00:01:40.619> here<00:01:40.829> but<00:01:40.979> if<00:01:41.070> maybe

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
really see in it from here but if maybe

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.760 
really see in it from here but if maybe
if<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.520> tip<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.570> sit<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.560> still

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
if I tip it you sit in this you still

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.859 
if I tip it you sit in this you still
use<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.950> spray<00:01:44.280> skirt<00:01:44.340> around<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.299> outside<00:01:45.720> of

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
use a spray skirt around the outside of

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.620 
use a spray skirt around the outside of
it<00:01:45.960> but<00:01:46.290> with<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.439> seesaw<00:01:47.009> if<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.970> water<00:01:48.210> floods

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
it but with a seesaw if the water floods

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.679 
it but with a seesaw if the water floods
in<00:01:48.930> you've<00:01:49.290> capsized<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:50.700> can<00:01:50.880> just<00:01:51.090> pull

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
in you've capsized you can just pull

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.469 
in you've capsized you can just pull
this<00:01:51.869> out<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.549> get<00:01:53.549> rid<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.939> water<00:01:54.149> and

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
then jump back in the boat meanwhile the

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:04.260 
then jump back in the boat meanwhile the
whole<00:01:56.579> boat<00:01:56.820> hasn't<00:01:57.030> flooded

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.270 

well<00:02:05.270> there's<00:02:05.450> a<00:02:05.510> lot<00:02:05.690> of<00:02:05.810> things<00:02:06.160> first<00:02:07.160> of

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
well there's a lot of things first of

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
all that the skin itself is incredibly

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.150 
all that the skin itself is incredibly
tough

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
tough
