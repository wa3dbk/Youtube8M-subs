00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 here you stefan from dr windows in the second 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.150
 I would like to video for the service per 3 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.360
 little on the hardware differences 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.050
 between the two surface generations 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.759
 enter 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.370
 you see on the right side of the 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.859
 service pro 2 and on the left side 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.720
 the new surface pro 3 at first 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.260
 look is already on the surface 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.119
 per 3 significantly increased in size 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.430
 if the two device-times 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.359
 it also becomes clear on top of each other 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:33.000
 how much the difference will matter if 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.719
 you look at the thick you see that 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.370
 the surface per 3 slightly thinner 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:44.579
 has become and thereby can that 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.649
 surface pro 3 also in the clear 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.320
 weight advantage for yourself 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.510
 So if you get this into the hand 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.410
 you actually have a right 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:59.100
 pleasant feeling and also the display 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:02.219
 size is close to the optimum for me 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.860
 Yesterday we were already in question in the 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.590
 comments how it is because of the surface 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.600
 per 3 in size increases in a4 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.330
 sheet behaves when he does that now 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.710
 Look, I have one so minimal 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:19.860
 bigger is the din a4 sheet of 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.080
 the width is also the leaf 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:27.119
 even wider but overall 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:31.920
 you are very close to din a4 din a4 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:34.549
 size which differences are still there 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.960
 between the two devices generation 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.299
 for me one of the most striking 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.579
 differences and unfortunately also the 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.030
 the most annoying differences is the 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:48.420
 Attaching the stylus if you can do that now 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:52.110
 surface pro2 takes the hand you have 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.829
 pen practically in the magnetic 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.780
 anchoring for the storage device stowed 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.000
 decisive advantage for me 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.600
 this construction is that one the 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.909
 pen also has it when you get it 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.700
 tablet gentleman takes that is unfortunately one 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:10.789
 little unfavorable solved the service 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.510
 per 3 here is the pen in 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.100
 A pocket on the keyboard 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.840
 that is moored if you only 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.800
 be on the move with the tablet 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.630
 And that's me often lies the pen 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.420
 mostly and where in the area or around 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.209
 is still on the keyboard 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.900
 that I have the attachment of the 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.690
 pin 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:39.440
 well for a product in the price region 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:41.420
 rather unfavorable or unhappy solved 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.850
 think it's a simple one you're letting 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.680
 In addition, could still stick or even 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.470
 would have to be on the keyboard 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.220
 I have to admit I expect that holds 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.560
 all quite well, I still think 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.120
 not an optimal solution especially since it yes 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.709
 certainly there are no customers 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.780
 keyboard to buy 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:03.290
 they will have some 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.239
 no way to get the pen anywhere 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.519
 attach or carry 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.280
 Let's have a look at the other hardware from 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.470
 surface pro 3 a little closer 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.570
 Here we have what the market 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.549
 yesterday in the photo have held 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:20.120
 you see hopefully in the video now synonymous 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:22.010
 a little irregularity in the 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.640
 completion of the text 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.320
 depending on how you hold it 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.079
 Personally, that does not feel like 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.060
 disturbing if the brand does not care 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.200
 it would have made me aware 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.480
 probably not further 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.880
 noticed 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.579
 the kick stunts itself is mine 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:44.090
 understood a bit too stiff 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:46.100
 where I think he's still a little bit 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.260
 But you will see how much you will borrow 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.840
 good as the kick stood in all 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.910
 possible positions are locked 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.440
 can 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:59.480
 Overall, this is a clear 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:03.049
 improvement over the surface pro2 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.579
 where we have only two positions here 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.780
 Incidentally, the war is completely over 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:10.360
 pleasant to use with one hand and 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.570
 also snaps 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:16.570
 30 years of use still safe one so 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:19.780
 no problems if you look at the 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:22.080
 Other hardware still looks 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.420
 here are the connections on the side 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:29.370
 usb 3.0 mini displayport on and 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:33.400
 switch off here above three and a half and 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:35.710
 headphone jack and then we have 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.020
 still the loud and quieter the button 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.790
 fan is also a bit smaller 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.580
 become from the distance as at 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.500
 surface pro does however like yesterday 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.830
 already wrote in the first video 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.480
 still a very good sound 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.490
 difference still at the keyboard 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.710
 it was also at the presentation 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.020
 already said you can the keyboard and 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.300
 attach two positions that would be now 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.280
 the position 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.780
 if you have the surface on your lap 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.910
 you can of course also with the 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.350
 set table 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.300
 Of course, this also works 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.790
 the keyboard is slightly upwards 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.500
 inclined or he could as soon as too 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.010
 at the old surfers just down 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.800
 fold 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:21.490
 I prefer this lying flat on 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:23.260
 position makes the device more stable 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.160
 rests and the keyboard also no 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:28.240
 makes noise when typing and 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:32.280
 otherwise maybe a little 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:35.919
 look at the stylists 9 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:41.710
 the highlight is of course the click 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:44.650
 on top of that on the trigger and the 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:47.979
 start onenote works very well 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:50.680
 reliable in this mode now you can 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:53.470
 you really just delete or write 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.930
 pen shape and color change works 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.890
 since not the device must first 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.200
 be unlocked 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:01.720
 that was the second video to the surface pro 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.919
 3 should have or ask uses the 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:07.350
 comment function 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:07.350
 otherwise see you next time
