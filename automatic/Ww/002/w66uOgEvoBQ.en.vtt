interesting<00:03:14.900> I<00:03:15.230> always<00:03:15.590> thought<00:03:15.770> that<00:03:15.830> Viking

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
interesting I always thought that Viking

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.180 
interesting I always thought that Viking
would<00:03:17.570> have<00:03:17.750> some<00:03:17.959> relevancy<00:03:18.620> to<00:03:18.770> the<00:03:18.860> housing

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
would have some relevancy to the housing

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.490 
would have some relevancy to the housing
market<00:03:19.220> but<00:03:20.180> know<00:03:20.450> more<00:03:20.630> and<00:03:20.780> more<00:03:20.870> now<00:03:21.200> that

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
market but know more and more now that

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.650 
market but know more and more now that
we've<00:03:21.800> studied<00:03:21.980> Viking<00:03:22.550> we<00:03:23.120> feel<00:03:23.330> that<00:03:23.510> their

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
we've studied Viking we feel that their

we've studied Viking we feel that their
innovation<00:03:24.400> market<00:03:25.400> is<00:03:25.550> going<00:03:25.700> to<00:03:25.760> be<00:03:25.850> a<00:03:25.880> lot

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
innovation market is going to be a lot

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.040 
innovation market is going to be a lot
faster<00:03:26.620> than<00:03:27.620> the<00:03:27.800> housing<00:03:28.190> starts

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
faster than the housing starts

Vikings business and renovation is
accelerating<00:03:35.780> a<00:03:35.990> lot<00:03:36.410> faster<00:03:36.770> in<00:03:36.890> the<00:03:36.950> United

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
accelerating a lot faster in the United

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.920 
accelerating a lot faster in the United
States<00:03:37.400> where<00:03:37.580> people<00:03:37.610> stay<00:03:38.480> in<00:03:38.630> their<00:03:38.660> home
