we have transformers research from

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:45.080 
we have transformers research from
damaged<00:05:40.050> a<00:05:40.760> lot<00:05:41.760> of<00:05:41.910> work<00:05:43.340> we<00:05:44.340> are<00:05:44.520> here<00:05:44.850> for

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.800 

this<00:06:05.130> huge<00:06:05.640> event<00:06:05.790> changed<00:06:06.360> the<00:06:06.450> face<00:06:06.630> they

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
this huge event changed the face they

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.530 
this huge event changed the face they
were<00:06:06.930> oversized<00:06:07.470> up<00:06:08.400> they<00:06:08.640> temporarily

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:09.540 
were oversized up they temporarily

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:13.040 
were oversized up they temporarily
temporarily<00:06:10.470> may<00:06:11.010> mean<00:06:11.250> weeks<00:06:11.760> or<00:06:11.970> months<00:06:12.300> but

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
temporarily may mean weeks or months but

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.170 
temporarily may mean weeks or months but
eventually<00:06:13.230> one<00:06:13.950> can<00:06:14.160> recover<00:06:14.490> just<00:06:15.060> like

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 
eventually one can recover just like

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:25.930 
eventually one can recover just like
we've<00:06:15.330> recovered<00:06:15.660> from<00:06:15.930> other<00:06:16.140> major<00:06:16.610> events

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:32.060 
this may not happen in your lifetime but
it's<00:06:29.310> not<00:06:29.550> science<00:06:30.150> fiction<00:06:30.680> we<00:06:31.680> know<00:06:31.830> that

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.070 
it's not science fiction we know that

one day in the future the Sun will

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.890 
one day in the future the Sun will
unleash<00:06:34.050> a<00:06:34.110> terrible<00:06:34.770> storm<00:06:35.130> like<00:06:35.490> this<00:06:35.900> there

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 
unleash a terrible storm like this there

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.530 
unleash a terrible storm like this there
is<00:06:36.930> no<00:06:37.080> way<00:06:37.410> we<00:06:37.620> can<00:06:37.770> prevent<00:06:38.100> it<00:06:38.280> the<00:06:39.210> next

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:39.540

is no way we can prevent it the next
cycle<00:06:39.870> of<00:06:39.990> extreme<00:06:40.440> solar<00:06:40.770> activity<00:06:41.370> is

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:41.400 
cycle of extreme solar activity is

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:46.730 
cycle of extreme solar activity is
predicted<00:06:42.030> to<00:06:42.060> happen<00:06:42.300> in<00:06:43.730> 2011
