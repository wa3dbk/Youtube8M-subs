that<00:01:25.740> this<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.369> dynamics<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.360> like<00:01:28.200> about

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
that this is the dynamics I like about

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.380 
that this is the dynamics I like about
the<00:01:29.040> games<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.400> are<00:01:29.579> coming<00:01:29.909> out<00:01:30.030> now

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
the games that are coming out now

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.990 
the games that are coming out now
they're<00:01:31.110> more<00:01:31.409> sociable<00:01:31.890> more<00:01:32.250> interactable

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
they're more sociable more interactable

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.870 
they're more sociable more interactable
and<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.840> think<00:01:34.130> Khalid<00:01:35.130> ed<00:01:35.310> was<00:01:35.430> trying<00:01:35.759> to

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
and I think Khalid ed was trying to

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.039 
and I think Khalid ed was trying to
figure<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.210> out<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.600> just<00:01:36.750> didn't

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
figure that out and it just didn't

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.780 
figure that out and it just didn't
happen<00:01:37.170> for<00:01:37.560> them<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.890> think<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.250> lot<00:01:38.460> of

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
happen for them and I think a lot of

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.550 
happen for them and I think a lot of
these<00:01:39.000> games<00:01:39.299> these<00:01:39.689> old<00:01:39.930> first-person

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
these games these old first-person

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.760 
these games these old first-person
shooters<00:01:40.890> are<00:01:41.130> not<00:01:41.369> capturing<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:43.200> social

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.170 
shooters are not capturing the social
