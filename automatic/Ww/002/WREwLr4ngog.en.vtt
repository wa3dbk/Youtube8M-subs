through<00:01:56.430> top<00:01:57.180> graphics<00:01:57.750> not<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:58.469> keen<00:01:58.799> on<00:01:58.950> the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
through top graphics not so keen on the

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.779 
through top graphics not so keen on the
bottom<00:01:59.310> bit<00:01:59.490> so<00:01:59.759> much<00:02:00.950> yeah<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:02.250> could<00:02:02.460> so<00:02:02.700> the

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
bottom bit so much yeah I could so the

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:03.800 
bottom bit so much yeah I could so the
graphics<00:02:03.060> don't<00:02:03.240> put<00:02:03.420> me<00:02:03.509> off<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.750> they

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
graphics don't put me off and they

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:04.969 
graphics don't put me off and they
shouldn't<00:02:04.049> put<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.350> off<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.710> should<00:02:04.890> be

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
shouldn't put you off you should be

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.139 
shouldn't put you off you should be
going<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.310> getting<00:02:05.430> fitted<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:05.880> getting<00:02:06.090> the

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
going and getting fitted and getting the

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.620 
going and getting fitted and getting the
best<00:02:06.360> one<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.600> suit<00:02:06.899> your<00:02:07.049> game<00:02:08.330> and<00:02:09.330> if<00:02:09.479> it's

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
best one to suit your game and if it's

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.600 
best one to suit your game and if it's
r1<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.140> mean<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:10.590> flight<00:02:10.860> is<00:02:10.979> so<00:02:11.190> similar<00:02:11.490> to

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
r1 I mean that flight is so similar to

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.220 
r1 I mean that flight is so similar to
what<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:11.820> just<00:02:11.880> hit<00:02:12.180> there<00:02:12.330> with<00:02:12.510> covert<00:02:12.930> tour

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
what I just hit there with covert tour

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.020 
what I just hit there with covert tour
so<00:02:13.890> if<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.070> numbers<00:02:14.370> are<00:02:14.460> the<00:02:14.490> same<00:02:14.550> for<00:02:14.940> these

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
so if the numbers are the same for these

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.600 
so if the numbers are the same for these
two<00:02:15.090> drivers<00:02:15.660> for<00:02:15.900> me<00:02:16.070> that<00:02:17.070> I'm<00:02:17.160> always<00:02:17.370> going

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
two drivers for me that I'm always going

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.800 
two drivers for me that I'm always going
to<00:02:17.700> go<00:02:17.820> with<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.030> one<00:02:18.120> I<00:02:18.180> like<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.540> look<00:02:18.660> of

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
to go with the one I like the look of

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:19.610 
to go with the one I like the look of
better<00:02:19.050> and<00:02:19.260> for<00:02:19.380> me

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
better and for me

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.339 
better and for me
I like<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:19.980> look<00:02:20.129> of<00:02:20.390> covert<00:02:21.390> or<00:02:21.629> I<00:02:21.900> mean<00:02:22.080> when

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
I like the look of covert or I mean when

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:23.780 
I like the look of covert or I mean when
you<00:02:22.409> talk<00:02:22.530> about<00:02:22.590> graphics<00:02:23.190> there<00:02:23.430> are<00:02:23.580> ones

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
you talk about graphics there are ones

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.910 
you talk about graphics there are ones
graphics<00:02:24.299> are<00:02:24.480> pretty<00:02:24.659> out<00:02:24.900> there<00:02:24.930> but<00:02:25.349> this

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
graphics are pretty out there but this

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.100 
graphics are pretty out there but this
is<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.099> redhead<00:02:26.400> with<00:02:27.060> a<00:02:27.120> massive<00:02:27.420> swoosh<00:02:27.780> on<00:02:27.959> it

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
is a redhead with a massive swoosh on it

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.539 
is a redhead with a massive swoosh on it
so<00:02:28.200> this<00:02:28.290> isn't<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.650> most<00:02:28.769> understated<00:02:29.220> time

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
so this isn't the most understated time

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.899 
so this isn't the most understated time
in<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:29.879> what<00:02:30.120> is<00:02:30.239> it<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.659> I<00:02:31.500> like<00:02:32.069> the<00:02:32.430> look<00:02:32.700> of

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
in the what is it and I like the look of

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:35.270 
in the what is it and I like the look of
that<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.420> bit<00:02:33.959> more<00:02:34.200> than<00:02:34.379> r1<00:02:34.680> bar<00:02:34.799> one's<00:02:35.099> a<00:02:35.190> nice

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
that a bit more than r1 bar one's a nice

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.520 
that a bit more than r1 bar one's a nice
cut<00:02:35.549> but<00:02:35.700> definitely<00:02:36.209> if<00:02:36.299> r1<00:02:36.540> gave<00:02:37.110> me<00:02:37.290> better

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
cut but definitely if r1 gave me better

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.880 
cut but definitely if r1 gave me better
numbers<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:38.129> would<00:02:38.700> use<00:02:39.690> it<00:02:39.959> and<00:02:40.170> what<00:02:40.739> they

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
numbers I would use it and what they

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.110 
numbers I would use it and what they
certainly<00:02:41.220> like<00:02:41.579> I<00:02:41.640> say<00:02:41.909> doesn't<00:02:42.360> bother<00:02:42.540> me

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
certainly like I say doesn't bother me

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.000 
certainly like I say doesn't bother me
personally<00:02:45.120> because<00:02:45.840> I<00:02:45.989> can<00:02:46.200> test<00:02:46.500> them<00:02:46.769> get

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
personally because I can test them get

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.069 
personally because I can test them get
me<00:02:47.129> on<00:02:47.250> I<00:02:47.280> don't<00:02:47.489> need<00:02:47.760> them<00:02:48.000> to<00:02:48.150> tell<00:02:48.420> me<00:02:48.780> so

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
me on I don't need them to tell me so

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:52.369 
me on I don't need them to tell me so
much<00:02:49.519> or<00:02:50.519> boast<00:02:51.329> things<00:02:51.660> with<00:02:51.840> distance<00:02:52.200> where

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
much or boast things with distance where

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.800 
much or boast things with distance where
do<00:02:52.470> I<00:02:52.530> find<00:02:52.829> that<00:02:52.920> out<00:02:53.069> myself<00:02:53.420> what<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.450> only

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
do I find that out myself what the only

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.089 
do I find that out myself what the only
thing<00:02:54.930> that<00:02:55.049> bothers<00:02:55.349> me<00:02:55.379> slightly<00:02:55.859> is<00:02:55.950> how

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
thing that bothers me slightly is how

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:57.710 
thing that bothers me slightly is how
people<00:02:56.310> interpret<00:02:56.819> that<00:02:57.209> and<00:02:57.299> then<00:02:57.420> come<00:02:57.599> in

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
people interpret that and then come in

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.500 
people interpret that and then come in
so<00:02:58.170> they<00:02:58.319> do<00:02:58.379> something<00:02:58.859> and<00:02:59.579> then<00:02:59.910> I'm<00:03:00.060> on<00:03:00.390> the

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
so they do something and then I'm on the

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.420 
so they do something and then I'm on the
front<00:03:00.750> line<00:03:00.930> if<00:03:01.109> you<00:03:01.200> like<00:03:01.319> so<00:03:01.440> I'm<00:03:01.560> seeing<00:03:01.799> the

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
front line if you like so I'm seeing the

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.640 
front line if you like so I'm seeing the
troops<00:03:02.700> coming<00:03:03.180> in<00:03:03.359> and<00:03:03.989> I'm<00:03:04.109> having<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:04.470> say

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
troops coming in and I'm having to say

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.170 
troops coming in and I'm having to say
actually<00:03:04.980> no<00:03:05.010> you're<00:03:05.340> not<00:03:05.489> right<00:03:05.730> that's<00:03:05.940> not

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
actually no you're not right that's not

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.360 
actually no you're not right that's not
giving<00:03:06.420> you<00:03:06.480> 20<00:03:06.810> after<00:03:06.989> distance<00:03:07.470> extra<00:03:07.890> well

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
giving you 20 after distance extra well

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.619 
giving you 20 after distance extra well
that's<00:03:08.549> not<00:03:08.760> helping<00:03:09.239> you<00:03:09.359> with<00:03:09.390> your

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
that's not helping you with your

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.300 
that's not helping you with your
clubface<00:03:09.900> control<00:03:10.379> just<00:03:10.590> shutting<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:11.099> face

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
clubface control just shutting the face

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.460 
clubface control just shutting the face
six<00:03:12.030> degrees<00:03:12.390> at<00:03:12.569> the<00:03:12.659> start<00:03:12.690> or<00:03:13.079> whatever<00:03:13.200> you

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
six degrees at the start or whatever you

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.589 
six degrees at the start or whatever you
may<00:03:14.370> be<00:03:14.430> there's<00:03:14.640> another<00:03:14.879> way<00:03:15.090> of<00:03:15.120> doing<00:03:15.269> it

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
may be there's another way of doing it

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.319 
may be there's another way of doing it
so<00:03:15.829> they're<00:03:16.829> the<00:03:17.069> things<00:03:17.280> where<00:03:17.579> I'm<00:03:17.819> working

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
so they're the things where I'm working

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.089 
so they're the things where I'm working
a<00:03:18.390> little<00:03:18.480> bit<00:03:18.720> more<00:03:18.930> against<00:03:19.650> Haley<00:03:19.829> makes<00:03:19.980> I

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
a little bit more against Haley makes I

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:21.380 
a little bit more against Haley makes I
think<00:03:20.250> they're<00:03:20.340> great<00:03:20.430> company<00:03:20.849> I<00:03:20.879> think<00:03:20.970> just

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
think they're great company I think just

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.789 
think they're great company I think just
by<00:03:21.569> trying<00:03:21.780> to<00:03:21.870> get<00:03:21.989> you<00:03:22.109> guys<00:03:22.140> to<00:03:22.440> understand

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
by trying to get you guys to understand

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.909 
by trying to get you guys to understand
a<00:03:22.980> bigger<00:03:23.760> picture<00:03:24.269> so<00:03:24.750> for<00:03:24.959> me<00:03:25.109> 92<00:03:25.590> it's<00:03:25.799> all

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:25.919 
a bigger picture so for me 92 it's all

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:29.180 
a bigger picture so for me 92 it's all
in<00:03:26.130> the<00:03:26.220> bag<00:03:26.400> I<00:03:27.139> could<00:03:28.139> absolutely<00:03:28.380> use<00:03:28.889> the

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190
