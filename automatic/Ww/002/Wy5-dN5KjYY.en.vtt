 How to make a bunny cage 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:26.300
 Today I will show you how to make three different bunny cages 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:40.880
 They are ranked from smallest to largest. The smallest is the most realistic, but it looks pretty crowded 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:58.280
 I give the bunnies in the end of the video 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:46.500
 The bunnies will be able to climb the ladder 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:50.640
 This last one looks a lot like the previous one, but it has some new features 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:27.080
 Realistic but small 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:33.900
 Two floors and much bigger 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:42.180
 Two floors access to the cage and outdoor area 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:52.640
