00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.400
 ok according to what we have seen 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.290
 we conclude that our life that has 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.290
 three points twenty meters in length 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.170
 It has a 30- centimeter cant in one 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.389
 side and 20 centimeters in the other that 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.670
 it means that the slope is 10 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.190
 centimeters as we already have the measurements 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.680
 of our reticulated life the first thing 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.320
 that proceeds is to draw a line in the 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.600
 floor to serve us and template 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.970
 that for our project we must 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.529
 make four of these beams 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.229
 completely equal 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:36.749
 -well being in the field or on the floor 

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:39.749
 The first thing that is done is to draw a 

00:00:36.749 --> 00:00:42.420
 line anyone who measures 3.20 meters 

00:00:39.749 --> 00:00:44.339
 length you already know using the strip 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.159
 line that is nothing more than a string 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:49.530
 powdered with ocher then a 

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:52.229
 line that measures 20 centimeters in one of 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.049
 the ends and make it square as it 

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:57.479
 shows in the figure the same in the other 

00:00:55.049 --> 00:01:00.749
 end is drawn another line with the same 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:02.659
 criterion but 30 centimeters then 

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:05.909
 obvious of 30 because we need 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:08.120
 reticulated contradict has a fall of 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.360
 10 centimeters 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.250
 yes I already know what they are thinking 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.800
 they guessed it is about other lines that 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.830
 a the line of 30 centimeters with the 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.750
 line of 20 and as you see already formed the 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.180
 10 centimeters slope that 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.790
 we need something for our project 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.070
 important we are learning installs 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.500
 beams and at the same time a little geometry 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.110
 that nobody does not like a 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.660
 recommendation if they want to be every time 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.180
 better installing details I suggest 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:42.340
 that read a little lean geometry 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.690
 squares angles curves ellipses 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.330
 formulas of how figures are drawn 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.150
 geometric a good retailer must 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.250
 know this, always consider that all 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.620
 the details of drywall that float on the 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.780
 Internet are projected based on the 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.600
 geometry take into account that the 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.670
 mathematics is an exact science so 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.400
 apply this to your experience already 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.470
 imagine how far they can get 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.740
 we continue to take half of the 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:13.940
 3.20 length which is the axis of the 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.810
 jointed beam osea 1,600 meters both 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.080
 sides like 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:21.500
 in the image then they are drawn to the 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.410
 left and right of the axis lines 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.590
 parallel to every 50 centimeters and to 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.560
 final what about this we take for 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.560
 finished the stroke all the floor this is 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:37.120
 a template and we're going to make four 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.120
 cross-linked beams
