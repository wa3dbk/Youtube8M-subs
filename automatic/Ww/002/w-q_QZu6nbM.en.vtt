now<00:00:00.840> it's<00:00:01.560> been<00:00:01.860> designed<00:00:02.220> and<00:00:02.460> engineered<00:00:02.610> to

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
now it's been designed and engineered to

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.579 
now it's been designed and engineered to
run<00:00:03.240> off<00:00:03.419> of<00:00:03.600> our<00:00:03.750> residential<00:00:04.440> water

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
run off of our residential water

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.490 
run off of our residential water
pressure<00:00:05.569> power<00:00:06.569> is<00:00:06.779> a<00:00:06.810> small<00:00:07.109> generator

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
pressure power is a small generator

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.839 
pressure power is a small generator
which<00:00:08.460> produces<00:00:08.490> 12<00:00:09.269> volts<00:00:09.599> of<00:00:09.719> AC<00:00:09.929> power<00:00:10.849> you

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
which produces 12 volts of AC power you

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.060 
which produces 12 volts of AC power you
can<00:00:12.059> power<00:00:12.599> it<00:00:12.630> by<00:00:12.840> your<00:00:13.019> hand<00:00:13.320> if<00:00:13.769> you'd<00:00:13.950> like

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
can power it by your hand if you'd like

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.410 
can power it by your hand if you'd like
to<00:00:14.219> just<00:00:14.340> turn<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.610> main<00:00:14.880> wheel<00:00:15.150> with<00:00:15.299> your

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
to just turn the main wheel with your

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:24.930 
to just turn the main wheel with your
hand<00:00:15.660> will<00:00:16.529> light<00:00:16.710> up<00:00:16.830> this<00:00:16.949> LED<00:00:17.369> strip

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:24.940 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.850 

huh<00:00:25.630> now<00:00:25.930> you<00:00:25.990> probably<00:00:26.289> don't<00:00:26.560> want<00:00:26.680> to<00:00:26.710> do

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:26.860 
huh now you probably don't want to do

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.890 
huh now you probably don't want to do
that<00:00:27.010> for<00:00:27.220> too<00:00:27.340> many<00:00:27.460> hours<00:00:27.580> I'm<00:00:28.270> getting

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
that for too many hours I'm getting

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.000 
that for too many hours I'm getting
close<00:00:29.140> to<00:00:29.320> being<00:00:29.529> done

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.010 
close to being done

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.590 
close to being done
yeah<00:00:30.250> let's<00:00:30.580> try<00:00:30.820> it<00:00:30.880> with<00:00:31.029> it<00:00:31.150> we'll<00:00:31.360> try<00:00:31.539> it

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:31.600 
yeah let's try it with it we'll try it

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.870 
yeah let's try it with it we'll try it
with<00:00:31.750> the<00:00:31.840> water<00:00:32.020> power<00:00:32.230> we<00:00:33.190> have<00:00:33.309> potential

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:33.880 
with the water power we have potential

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.920 
with the water power we have potential
energy<00:00:33.970> in<00:00:34.720> the<00:00:35.340> pressurized<00:00:36.340> water<00:00:36.480> as<00:00:37.480> we

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
energy in the pressurized water as we

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:49.300 
energy in the pressurized water as we
open<00:00:38.470> the<00:00:38.670> taps

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:49.310 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.190 

so<00:00:50.310> the<00:00:50.490> the<00:00:50.940> potential<00:00:51.300> energy<00:00:51.540> on<00:00:51.900> the<00:00:52.020> water

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.200 
so the the potential energy on the water

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.690 
so the the potential energy on the water
is<00:00:52.500> quite<00:00:52.680> rich<00:00:52.890> you'll<00:00:53.100> be<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.340> up<00:00:53.460> at<00:00:53.610> the

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700 
is quite rich you'll be it up at the

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.030 
is quite rich you'll be it up at the
water<00:00:53.880> tower<00:00:54.180> correct<00:00:55.080> where<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.710> waters

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
water tower correct where the waters

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.240 
water tower correct where the waters
above<00:00:56.280> us<00:00:56.570> it<00:00:57.570> with<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.350> column<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.830> water<00:00:58.890> you

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
above us it with a column of water you

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.079 
above us it with a column of water you
have<00:01:00.110> the<00:01:01.110> column<00:01:01.440> will<00:01:02.130> give<00:01:02.160> you

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.749 

we<00:01:05.630> run<00:01:05.810> the<00:01:05.930> water<00:01:06.079> through<00:01:06.229> the<00:01:06.470> turbine<00:01:06.890> so

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
we run the water through the turbine so

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:09.850 
we run the water through the turbine so
for<00:01:08.000> potential<00:01:08.479> energy<00:01:08.630> at<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:09.500> stretch<00:01:09.740> the

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
for potential energy at the stretch the

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.920 
for potential energy at the stretch the
flow<00:01:10.100> you<00:01:10.310> have<00:01:10.460> a<00:01:10.490> mass<00:01:10.759> moving<00:01:11.060> which<00:01:11.750> is

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
flow you have a mass moving which is

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.590 
flow you have a mass moving which is

phone will now make the connection as to
how<00:02:22.080> that<00:02:22.290> cell<00:02:22.500> phone<00:02:22.680> actually<00:02:23.070> gets

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
how that cell phone actually gets

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.140 
how that cell phone actually gets
charged<00:02:23.870> you<00:02:24.870> can<00:02:24.930> see<00:02:25.200> it's<00:02:25.350> now<00:02:25.500> powering<00:02:25.950> up

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
charged you can see it's now powering up

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.430 
charged you can see it's now powering up
and<00:02:27.150> we're<00:02:27.480> charging<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:28.020> cell<00:02:28.230> phone

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
and we're charging the cell phone

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.550 
and we're charging the cell phone
battery<00:02:29.480> so<00:02:30.480> now<00:02:30.690> what<00:02:30.840> we're<00:02:31.020> doing<00:02:31.050> is<00:02:31.350> we're

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
battery so now what we're doing is we're

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.210 
battery so now what we're doing is we're
taking<00:02:31.590> potential<00:02:32.370> energy<00:02:33.110> returning<00:02:34.110> it<00:02:34.230> to

and then into chemical interviews that
we<00:02:40.990> charge<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.410> batteries<00:02:41.800> and<00:02:42.660> that<00:02:43.660> will

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
we charge the batteries and that will

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.420 
we charge the batteries and that will
charge<00:02:43.990> your<00:02:44.230> cell<00:02:44.410> phone<00:02:44.680> as<00:02:44.890> fast<00:02:45.160> as

plugging it into a wall outlet even

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.940 
plugging it into a wall outlet even
though<00:02:48.940> this<00:02:49.090> is<00:02:49.270> a<00:02:49.300> much<00:02:49.630> lower<00:02:50.140> power<00:02:50.710> output

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
though this is a much lower power output

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.820 
though this is a much lower power output
than<00:02:51.370> your<00:02:51.520> wall

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
than your wall

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.090 
than your wall
it's<00:02:52.950> depended<00:02:53.430> upon<00:02:53.520> how

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
it's depended upon how

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.319 
it's depended upon how
these<00:02:55.250> doors<00:02:55.490> are<00:02:55.850> being

these doors are being

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.809 
these doors are being
so<00:02:58.329> this<00:02:58.510> meets<00:02:58.719> the<00:02:58.870> demands<00:02:59.170> of<00:02:59.349> the<00:02:59.439> phone

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
so this meets the demands of the phone

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.709 
so this meets the demands of the phone
charges<00:03:00.819> yeah

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:01.719 
charges yeah

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:04.410 
charges yeah
so<00:03:02.349> now<00:03:02.500> as<00:03:02.769> long<00:03:02.920> as<00:03:02.980> you've<00:03:03.219> got<00:03:03.250> water<00:03:04.150> power

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
so now as long as you've got water power

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.270 
so now as long as you've got water power
you've<00:03:05.290> got<00:03:05.819> Tony<00:03:06.819> about<00:03:07.090> water<00:03:07.299> pressure

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
you've got Tony about water pressure

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.160 
you've got Tony about water pressure
it's<00:03:10.090> open

we're now charging the iPad we have a
vacuum<00:03:32.590> monitoring<00:03:33.250> program<00:03:34.090> here<00:03:34.560> that
