00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
again that is how I paint with the

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.300 
again that is how I paint with the
watercolour<00:04:56.350> sticks<00:04:56.650> now<00:04:56.830> you<00:04:56.950> might<00:04:57.100> find

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
watercolour sticks now you might find

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.190 
watercolour sticks now you might find
other<00:04:57.460> ways<00:04:57.700> to<00:04:57.760> paint<00:04:58.150> with<00:04:58.270> them<00:04:58.480> but<00:04:58.960> I<00:04:58.990> feel

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
other ways to paint with them but I feel

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.260 
other ways to paint with them but I feel
that's<00:04:59.410> pretty<00:04:59.860> much<00:05:00.010> the<00:05:00.490> same<00:05:00.790> technique

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
that's pretty much the same technique

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.670 
that's pretty much the same technique
shouldn't<00:05:01.570> be<00:05:01.630> using<00:05:01.810> just<00:05:02.169> different<00:05:02.440> times

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
shouldn't be using just different times

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.980 
shouldn't be using just different times
that<00:05:02.830> is<00:05:02.950> a<00:05:02.980> wet-on-wet<00:05:03.250> approach<00:05:03.850> and<00:05:04.210> I'll

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
that is a wet-on-wet approach and I'll

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.230 
that is a wet-on-wet approach and I'll
be<00:05:05.110> doing<00:05:05.380> another<00:05:05.590> one<00:05:05.830> here<00:05:06.340> pretty<00:05:06.580> soon<00:05:06.669> on

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
be doing another one here pretty soon on

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.570 
be doing another one here pretty soon on
on<00:05:07.690> other<00:05:07.870> techniques<00:05:08.410> to<00:05:08.980> kind<00:05:09.190> of<00:05:09.220> mix<00:05:09.460> and

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
on other techniques to kind of mix and

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.480 
on other techniques to kind of mix and
match<00:05:09.820> alright<00:05:10.540> so<00:05:10.960> until<00:05:11.230> next<00:05:11.350> time<00:05:11.530> see<00:05:11.830> you

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
match alright so until next time see you

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.669 
match alright so until next time see you
again
