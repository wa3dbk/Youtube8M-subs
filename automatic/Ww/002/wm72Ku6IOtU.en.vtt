00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
so this is the first exercise you do and

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.849 
so this is the first exercise you do and
I<00:00:59.190> would<00:00:59.399> say<00:00:59.609> start<00:01:00.000> out<00:01:00.180> by<00:01:00.649> counting<00:01:01.649> to

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
I would say start out by counting to

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.020 
I would say start out by counting to
like<00:01:02.070> ten<00:01:02.489> on<00:01:02.820> each<00:01:02.879> leg<00:01:03.140> so<00:01:04.140> one<00:01:04.710> two<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.880> know

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
like ten on each leg so one two you know

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.730 
like ten on each leg so one two you know
to<00:01:06.090> pin<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.659> then<00:01:06.780> switch<00:01:07.049> over<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.710> other

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
to pin and then switch over to the other

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.210 
to pin and then switch over to the other
one<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.659> then<00:01:09.659> slowly<00:01:10.140> count<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.740> ten<00:01:10.979> and

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
one and then slowly count to ten and

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.730 
one and then slowly count to ten and
you'll<00:01:11.790> find<00:01:12.090> like<00:01:12.659> most<00:01:12.930> people<00:01:13.260> one<00:01:13.530> years

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
you'll find like most people one years

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.490 
you'll find like most people one years
longer<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.760> know<00:01:14.880> one<00:01:15.119> eye<00:01:15.150> is<00:01:15.330> higher<00:01:15.689> one<00:01:16.350> of

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
longer you know one eye is higher one of

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.109 
longer you know one eye is higher one of
your<00:01:16.650> legs<00:01:16.920> will<00:01:17.159> be<00:01:17.310> stronger<00:01:17.790> than<00:01:17.939> the

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
your legs will be stronger than the

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.120 
your legs will be stronger than the
other<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:18.720> one<00:01:19.080> side<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.740> it'll<00:01:19.950> be<00:01:20.009> a

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
other so one side of you it'll be a

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.310 
other so one side of you it'll be a
whole<00:01:20.400> lot<00:01:20.610> easier<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:21.060> do<00:01:21.330> this<00:01:21.540> than<00:01:21.750> on<00:01:22.140> the

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
whole lot easier to do this than on the

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.520 
whole lot easier to do this than on the
other<00:01:22.350> side<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:23.610> that's<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.970> first<00:01:24.180> exercise

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
other side so that's the first exercise

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.649 
other side so that's the first exercise
