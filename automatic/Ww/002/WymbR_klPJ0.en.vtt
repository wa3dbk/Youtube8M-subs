00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:30.500
Tom and I are vegetarians. We don't want animals to 
 be hurt or to live in circuses. 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.440
This is what animals go through, you have to imagine that.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
They are responsible for the amusement of people.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.500
That's why we are taking some photos today 
 and we are going to be chained.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.500
To people at first they think that it's funny 
 and that the animals are having fun.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.000
But in reality it is much different.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.850
Because they have to control the animals. To do 
 that training is necessary and hitting is involved.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.050
There are always parents who go to the circus with their little children.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.000
The little children don't know anything about the reality.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.200
That's why the parents have to be aware that this isn't okay.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.750
There are cool circuses with artists and stuff. We 
 have gone to places like that too.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Now we go even further. We are going into the cages.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.480
Interviewer: Do you think this is how an animal feels when caged.

00:01:53.855 --> 00:01:54.600
No, I don't think so.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.600
It's a thousand times worse for the animals.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.000
We are just here for ten minutes for 
 a photo and that's already enough. 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.750
We come across a lot of animals in show business in 
 general. In TV shows, performances and in video shoots.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.900
That is something we refuse to be part of in anyway.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.500
When an animal is caged it just doesn't understand, It's just locked in.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.000
I just cant stand it. If I think about 
 it, it brings tears to my eyes.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.520
The first dog we got was from an animal shelter it was seriously injured.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.940
He had burns all over his ears, because the former 
 owner put out his cigarettes on his ears.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.430
He had bad teeth, because they gave him beer when he was young.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.710
These are experiences that have influenced us. Absolutely!

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.500
T-shirt says: Stop animal torture!

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.800
Hey, we are Bill and Tom from Tokio Hotel and we support PETA.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.880
Don't let the wild animals down, they should 
 be free and not in a circus.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.450
To support all of this go to www.peta.de and become informed.
