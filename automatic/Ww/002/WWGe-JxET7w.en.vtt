00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.690
 on the other hand, the VfL Osnabrück again not by the people here 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.430
 were probably the only German participants Danger Thomas Reichenberger 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:14.349
 which only matters how far we are 

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:20.070
 on goal space scenes prevails today on both sides the definite numbers mag 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.560
 61 minutes of play 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.560
 the more typical 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:33.920
 Only two minutes later, the next installment, the host has Thomas 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.380
 Reichenberger it is now really rich to be allowed 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.270
 again Carsten Nulle remains the winner 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.830
 while in the actual safe in the hands of that Reichenberger the 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.830
 outgoing whether a weekend again on Sundays 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.500
 v 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.280
 continue the second goal 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.280
 that would have 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.790
 and Carsten Nulle the Red Red right and the beast on the spot 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.660
 at once this goal is it the ZDF environment the ball here without words 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:21.980
 against Hansen 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.690
 and that's the consequence of Leichenberge adidas it was a 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.230
 neither on the way to strike yourself here 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.360
 Montas 0 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.190
 the reaction of the FCZ, there is again a rearing yet remain just under 30 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.540
 Minutes first will be changed 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.710
 schmaltz every fight can be despite the recent setback 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.950
 not missing 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.380
 but even more satisfied can be softened 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.700
 that was the decisive man, after all 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.700
 Meanwhile, Seibt Inc owns it 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.489
 BGN 2 gets through nicely 

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:21.649
 the lean though 

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:24.829
 she can not find any 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:28.059
 but the guests put off the possible respect 

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:31.689
 and Vienna also elected in May 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:33.749
 just like here 

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:36.749
 Torsten Ziegner 

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:40.789
 but the Etz remains on 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:43.429
 everyone plays well » 

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:44.649
 parking 

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:49.549
 Time management Bull Karsten Baumann was the result for his team 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.769
 Performance not 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.509
 shortly thereafter, Niels Hansen may go relatively inconspicuously for the deed 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.319
 but throw 

00:03:01.029 --> 00:03:05.049
 in the meantime also in a corner from in the game we are already in the 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.709
 In the final minutes the guests continue their efforts but slowly dwindle »Kraft and 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.529
 Creativity only Alonso who defends himself against this defeat 

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:13.749
 but before ca 

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:16.509
 Citizens vaccinate 

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:22.149
 the will is there the chances are there but the conclusion is who you are today 

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:25.999
 and then Barth's frustration was his best at depending on the browser 

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:28.339
 raised 

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:31.339
 out of the circle 

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:37.569
 and the best Jena has heard 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.339
 We will see this action again soon 

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:43.339
 the yellow card 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:50.009
 Oscar 

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:52.329
 Paris 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:55.549
 Red 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:58.549
 that money 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:01.839
 the MDAX took 0 4 under 

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:09.079
 if I do the 1 0 then always 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:12.340
 and I'm sorry for teams that's what I did 

00:04:13.029 --> 00:04:15.849
 everyone threatens to die a bit in beauty before that 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:18.909
 That's always very good 

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:21.719
 to put that beauty 

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:25.569
 the chances of the chance that was a bus were from Norbert Fluhr 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.319
 It's not that the train is over but our government is trying 

00:04:30.309 --> 00:04:32.210
 The player hurled 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.949
 are solid 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:35.789
 should have happened here around 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:37.389
 and little chance 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:40.370
 they did not do that and percent if you do that then then 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.000
 either it is always so good she thinks the goal back to 0 2 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.650
 not even fallen in a row is the first date as you then locally 

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:51.469
 Young players can be their reproach 

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:54.429
 We win together and we lose together only when you do that 

00:04:54.429 --> 00:04:56.110
 then ne 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.410
 then it even comes out 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.270
 you have to concretize the topic as I have to do nothing first 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.499
 I have to concretize now that they have their films and percent 

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:06.589
 there must and before clear words find 

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:09.430
 Alan Gold from Prague Euro 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:16.000
 with the sozis should give the captain's trouble he is firm after this 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.520
 new defeat and 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.129
 the third game in a row without own scoring b 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:24.059
 Everyone has the good start to the season already 

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:26.629
 what is the duty 

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:28.669
 Both the bad mood in Jena can get him 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:31.919
 now is out but from breeding meanwhile back - 10 are them 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:35.150
 Once this reparation has gone wrong 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:36.050
 and that's where we come from
