killstreaks<00:02:19.280> of<00:02:19.640> getting<00:02:19.820> kills<00:02:20.000> as<00:02:20.150> well<00:02:20.330> and

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
killstreaks of getting kills as well and

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.750 
killstreaks of getting kills as well and
because<00:02:21.050> a<00:02:21.080> place<00:02:21.320> LOL<00:02:21.530> i<00:02:21.920> got<00:02:22.130> really<00:02:22.250> far<00:02:22.580> to

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
because a place LOL i got really far to

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.700 
because a place LOL i got really far to
be<00:02:22.850> in<00:02:22.910> my<00:02:23.030> killstreaks<00:02:23.240> and<00:02:23.870> emily<00:02:24.470> I'll<00:02:24.590> be

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
be in my killstreaks and emily I'll be

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.530 
be in my killstreaks and emily I'll be
losing<00:02:24.910> teammates<00:02:25.910> that<00:02:26.030> I<00:02:26.090> get<00:02:26.270> paired<00:02:26.480> up

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
losing teammates that I get paired up

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.820 
losing teammates that I get paired up
with<00:02:26.660> I<00:02:26.780> can't<00:02:26.990> really<00:02:27.140> ask<00:02:27.230> too<00:02:27.380> much<00:02:27.530> of<00:02:27.590> them

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
with I can't really ask too much of them

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.500 
with I can't really ask too much of them
so<00:02:28.310> that's<00:02:28.760> why<00:02:28.880> I<00:02:28.910> generally<00:02:29.210> like<00:02:29.270> to<00:02:29.330> run

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
so that's why I generally like to run

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.390 
so that's why I generally like to run
the<00:02:29.750> blood<00:02:29.900> bed<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.350> dogs<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:30.740> as<00:02:30.830> well<00:02:31.010> it

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
the blood bed the dogs and as well it

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.560 
the blood bed the dogs and as well it
should<00:02:31.460> really<00:02:31.700> leave<00:02:32.000> me<00:02:32.150> to<00:02:32.270> do<00:02:32.360> everything

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
should really leave me to do everything

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.300 
should really leave me to do everything
and<00:02:33.080> that's<00:02:33.230> what<00:02:33.440> I<00:02:33.470> am<00:02:33.680> to<00:02:33.860> get<00:02:33.950> me<00:02:34.070> the<00:02:34.160> high

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
and that's what I am to get me the high

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.100 
and that's what I am to get me the high
kills<00:02:34.640> but<00:02:35.000> this<00:02:35.210> cutoff<00:02:35.510> is<00:02:35.750> what<00:02:35.900> you<00:02:35.990> can

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
kills but this cutoff is what you can

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.540 
kills but this cutoff is what you can
just<00:02:36.140> get<00:02:36.410> a<00:02:36.440> ridiculous<00:02:36.980> amount<00:02:37.070> of<00:02:37.340> kills

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
just get a ridiculous amount of kills

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:38.980 
just get a ridiculous amount of kills
we've<00:02:37.790> just<00:02:37.970> cause<00:02:38.090> of<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.270> rotation<00:02:38.660> because

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
we've just cause of the rotation because

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.750 
we've just cause of the rotation because
you<00:02:39.590> know<00:02:39.710> the<00:02:39.830> lightning<00:02:40.100> strike<00:02:40.340> gets<00:02:40.610> me

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
you know the lightning strike gets me

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.640 
you know the lightning strike gets me
really<00:02:40.850> close<00:02:41.210> to<00:02:41.330> my<00:02:41.420> lodestar<00:02:41.930> it<00:02:42.380> doesn't

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
really close to my lodestar it doesn't

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.870 
really close to my lodestar it doesn't
get<00:02:42.740> you<00:02:42.860> there<00:02:43.040> because<00:02:43.340> lightning<00:02:43.610> strikes

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
get you there because lightning strikes

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.600 
get you there because lightning strikes
only<00:02:44.030> 600<00:02:44.690> and<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:44.900> Lord<00:02:45.080> stars<00:02:45.350> like<00:02:45.610> 1200

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
only 600 and the Lord stars like 1200

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.280 
only 600 and the Lord stars like 1200
but<00:02:47.060> you<00:02:47.150> need<00:02:47.300> like<00:02:47.510> a<00:02:47.540> cap<00:02:47.900> and<00:02:48.080> then<00:02:48.230> a

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
but you need like a cap and then a

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.570 
but you need like a cap and then a
couple<00:02:48.440> of<00:02:48.590> fields<00:02:48.800> we<00:02:48.890> lightning<00:02:49.190> strike<00:02:49.400> and

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
couple of fields we lightning strike and

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.740 
couple of fields we lightning strike and
you're<00:02:49.640> pretty<00:02:49.790> much<00:02:49.910> there<00:02:50.270> with<00:02:50.420> it<00:02:50.570> and

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
you're pretty much there with it and

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.480 
you're pretty much there with it and
then<00:02:51.050> once<00:02:51.230> you've<00:02:51.350> got<00:02:51.500> that<00:02:51.530> it's<00:02:51.950> only<00:02:52.160> one

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
then once you've got that it's only one

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.400 
then once you've got that it's only one
molecule<00:02:52.760> for<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:53.240> warship<00:02:53.660> and<00:02:53.840> then<00:02:54.260> that's

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
molecule for the warship and then that's

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.900 
molecule for the warship and then that's
it<00:02:54.560> with<00:02:54.680> a<00:02:54.740> load<00:02:54.890> found<00:02:55.160> wardship<00:02:55.430> combined

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
it with a load found wardship combined

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
it with a load found wardship combined
that<00:02:56.090> gets<00:02:56.270> you<00:02:56.360> back<00:02:56.480> to<00:02:56.630> your<00:02:56.720> lightning

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
that gets you back to your lightning

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.330 
that gets you back to your lightning
strike<00:02:57.260> and<00:02:57.470> then<00:02:57.560> you<00:02:57.680> just<00:02:57.800> continue<00:02:58.100> the

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
strike and then you just continue the

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.010 
strike and then you just continue the
whole<00:02:58.490> rotation<00:02:58.850> again<00:02:59.150> so<00:02:59.510> you<00:02:59.570> technically

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
whole rotation again so you technically

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.140 
whole rotation again so you technically
never<00:03:00.380> really<00:03:00.770> see<00:03:00.980> any<00:03:01.130> enemies<00:03:01.460> although<00:03:02.120> I

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
never really see any enemies although I

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.360 
never really see any enemies although I
do<00:03:02.240> get<00:03:02.510> a<00:03:02.570> 73<00:03:03.110> street<00:03:03.380> I<00:03:03.530> think<00:03:03.830> the<00:03:04.100> actual

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
do get a 73 street I think the actual

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.490 
do get a 73 street I think the actual
gun<00:03:04.610> kills<00:03:04.880> is<00:03:05.090> a<00:03:05.180> 22<00:03:05.480> gun<00:03:05.780> shriek<00:03:06.050> you<00:03:06.410> know

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
gun kills is a 22 gun shriek you know

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.990 
gun kills is a 22 gun shriek you know
and<00:03:06.620> that's<00:03:06.740> still<00:03:06.950> pretty<00:03:07.100> good<00:03:07.430> but<00:03:07.700> it<00:03:07.850> just

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
and that's still pretty good but it just

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.340 
and that's still pretty good but it just
shows<00:03:08.090> you<00:03:08.300> how<00:03:08.330> many<00:03:08.540> kills<00:03:08.750> actually<00:03:09.080> get<00:03:09.260> in

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
shows you how many kills actually get in

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.930 
shows you how many kills actually get in
my<00:03:09.440> squash<00:03:09.680> drinks<00:03:10.010> but<00:03:10.430> this<00:03:10.550> is<00:03:10.670> a<00:03:10.700> scar

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
my squash drinks but this is a scar

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.370 
my squash drinks but this is a scar
except<00:03:11.300> i'd<00:03:11.510> recommend<00:03:11.960> if<00:03:12.080> you<00:03:12.170> know<00:03:12.320> you

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
except i'd recommend if you know you

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.630 
except i'd recommend if you know you
maybe<00:03:12.560> you<00:03:12.680> out<00:03:12.770> good<00:03:12.950> at<00:03:13.040> one<00:03:13.190> on<00:03:13.280> one<00:03:13.430> gun

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
maybe you out good at one on one gun

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.010 
maybe you out good at one on one gun
fight<00:03:13.850> so<00:03:14.060> it<00:03:14.180> might<00:03:14.360> be<00:03:14.480> a<00:03:14.510> bit<00:03:14.600> easy<00:03:14.750> for<00:03:14.960> you

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
fight so it might be a bit easy for you

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.090 
fight so it might be a bit easy for you
then<00:03:15.200> to<00:03:15.380> putting<00:03:15.590> your<00:03:15.680> first<00:03:15.890> one<00:03:16.070> a

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
then to putting your first one a

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.010 
then to putting your first one a
flatbeds<00:03:16.580> try<00:03:17.090> it<00:03:17.150> out<00:03:17.270> and<00:03:17.480> let<00:03:17.810> me<00:03:17.870> know<00:03:17.960> if

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
flatbeds try it out and let me know if

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.330 
flatbeds try it out and let me know if
it<00:03:18.110> works<00:03:18.140> for<00:03:18.320> you<00:03:18.410> I<00:03:18.620> like<00:03:19.010> what<00:03:19.160> I<00:03:19.190> said

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.160 
here I got to admit I didn't even know
this<00:03:28.970> room<00:03:29.180> existed<00:03:29.630> it<00:03:29.780> looks<00:03:29.930> like<00:03:30.020> there's

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
this room existed it looks like there's

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.750 
this room existed it looks like there's
only<00:03:30.230> one<00:03:30.500> staircase<00:03:30.860> that<00:03:31.250> can<00:03:31.430> get<00:03:31.520> you<00:03:31.640> in

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
only one staircase that can get you in

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.920 
only one staircase that can get you in
here<00:03:31.820> you<00:03:32.000> can<00:03:32.120> probably<00:03:32.300> like<00:03:32.510> jump<00:03:32.720> up<00:03:32.900> from

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
here you can probably like jump up from

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.750 
here you can probably like jump up from
one<00:03:33.170> of<00:03:33.260> the<00:03:33.320> windows<00:03:33.470> but<00:03:33.680> i'm<00:03:34.190> not<00:03:34.430> a<00:03:34.490> sniper

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
one of the windows but i'm not a sniper

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.310 
one of the windows but i'm not a sniper
so<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:35.180> reason<00:03:35.390> I<00:03:35.600> go<00:03:35.810> in<00:03:35.930> there<00:03:36.050> is<00:03:36.200> the

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
so the reason I go in there is the

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.930 
so the reason I go in there is the
killer<00:03:36.470> sniper<00:03:36.800> so<00:03:37.220> I<00:03:37.250> think<00:03:37.370> just<00:03:37.730> from<00:03:37.790> this

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
killer sniper so I think just from this

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.760 
killer sniper so I think just from this
one<00:03:38.150> game<00:03:38.390> like<00:03:38.630> my<00:03:38.810> map<00:03:39.050> awareness<00:03:39.290> just<00:03:39.620> grew

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
one game like my map awareness just grew

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.950 
one game like my map awareness just grew
by<00:03:39.950> a<00:03:39.980> thousand<00:03:40.370> percent<00:03:40.430> but<00:03:41.150> come<00:03:41.630> on<00:03:41.690> up<00:03:41.840> now

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:41.960 
by a thousand percent but come on up now

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.930 
by a thousand percent but come on up now
actually<00:03:42.500> make<00:03:42.680> a<00:03:42.860> bit<00:03:43.010> of<00:03:43.100> a<00:03:43.190> boo-boo<00:03:43.340> I'm

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
actually make a bit of a boo-boo I'm

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.520 
actually make a bit of a boo-boo I'm
just<00:03:44.150> clearing<00:03:44.330> the<00:03:44.480> area<00:03:44.690> around<00:03:44.870> see<00:03:45.290> and

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
just clearing the area around see and

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.500 
just clearing the area around see and
I'm<00:03:46.130> just<00:03:46.340> jumping<00:03:46.580> on<00:03:46.730> to<00:03:46.850> cap<00:03:47.030> it<00:03:47.060> and<00:03:47.360> I<00:03:47.450> do

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
I'm just jumping on to cap it and I do

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.330 
I'm just jumping on to cap it and I do
get<00:03:47.840> a<00:03:47.900> couple<00:03:48.230> of<00:03:48.320> kills<00:03:48.530> like<00:03:48.860> as<00:03:49.070> I'm<00:03:49.190> doing

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
get a couple of kills like as I'm doing

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.190 
get a couple of kills like as I'm doing
it<00:03:49.520> and<00:03:49.610> my<00:03:49.820> scar<00:03:50.270> Street<00:03:50.510> buyers<00:03:50.750> just<00:03:50.930> going

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
it and my scar Street buyers just going

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.810 
it and my scar Street buyers just going
up<00:03:51.320> very<00:03:51.350> fast<00:03:51.740> I<00:03:52.070> think<00:03:52.280> I'm<00:03:52.370> about<00:03:52.490> to<00:03:52.700> wipe

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
up very fast I think I'm about to wipe

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.490 
up very fast I think I'm about to wipe
over<00:03:53.120> my<00:03:53.240> lodestar<00:03:53.690> so<00:03:53.870> I'm<00:03:53.930> like<00:03:54.080> are<00:03:54.260> better

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
over my lodestar so I'm like are better

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.500 
over my lodestar so I'm like are better
call<00:03:54.740> it<00:03:54.860> in<00:03:54.890> quick<00:03:55.220> and<00:03:55.520> I<00:03:55.640> call<00:03:55.820> in<00:03:56.030> as<00:03:56.150> his<00:03:56.240> 30

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
call it in quick and I call in as his 30

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.150 
call it in quick and I call in as his 30
seconds<00:03:56.990> to<00:03:57.020> go<00:03:57.260> but<00:03:57.770> if<00:03:57.830> I'd<00:03:57.920> have<00:03:58.010> just

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
seconds to go but if I'd have just

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.040 
seconds to go but if I'd have just
waited<00:03:58.430> a<00:03:58.700> few<00:03:58.910> more<00:03:59.090> seconds<00:03:59.540> later<00:03:59.780> that's

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 
waited a few more seconds later that's

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:01.330 
waited a few more seconds later that's
in<00:04:00.170> that<00:04:00.320> the<00:04:00.470> time<00:04:00.860> would<00:04:01.070> have<00:04:01.160> gone<00:04:01.280> to

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
in that the time would have gone to

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.220 
in that the time would have gone to
orange<00:04:01.730> and<00:04:01.910> I<00:04:01.940> deserved<00:04:02.300> it<00:04:02.480> but<00:04:02.690> there<00:04:03.140> was

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
orange and I deserved it but there was

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.140 
orange and I deserved it but there was
literally<00:04:03.530> a<00:04:03.680> second<00:04:04.190> in<00:04:04.310> it<00:04:04.460> but<00:04:04.910> the<00:04:05.060> air

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
literally a second in it but the air

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.430 
literally a second in it but the air
this<00:04:05.270> lodestar<00:04:05.750> it<00:04:05.870> doesn't<00:04:06.110> really<00:04:06.200> do<00:04:06.410> much

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
this lodestar it doesn't really do much

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.230 
this lodestar it doesn't really do much
I've<00:04:06.830> just<00:04:07.010> shown<00:04:07.190> you<00:04:07.220> the<00:04:07.460> N<00:04:07.550> bit<00:04:07.760> like<00:04:08.150> the

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.240 
I've just shown you the N bit like the

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.210 
I've just shown you the N bit like the
last<00:04:08.420> seven<00:04:08.750> seconds<00:04:09.200> or<00:04:09.290> something<00:04:09.620> and<00:04:09.980> I

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
last seven seconds or something and I

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.470 
last seven seconds or something and I
did<00:04:10.400> manage<00:04:10.580> to<00:04:10.760> get<00:04:10.880> a<00:04:10.910> few<00:04:11.030> kills<00:04:11.270> just

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
did manage to get a few kills just

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.390 
did manage to get a few kills just
before<00:04:11.720> the<00:04:11.810> time<00:04:11.990> runs<00:04:12.020> out<00:04:12.350> so<00:04:12.890> yeah<00:04:13.160> that's

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
before the time runs out so yeah that's

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.560 
before the time runs out so yeah that's
like<00:04:13.550> another<00:04:13.790> one<00:04:14.030> of<00:04:14.060> those<00:04:14.210> things<00:04:14.420> where

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
like another one of those things where

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:15.970 
like another one of those things where
what<00:04:14.840> ifs<00:04:15.050> maybe<00:04:15.350> if<00:04:15.530> I<00:04:15.620> was<00:04:15.680> in<00:04:15.830> there<00:04:15.950> a

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
what ifs maybe if I was in there a

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.660 
what ifs maybe if I was in there a
little<00:04:16.100> bit<00:04:16.280> longer<00:04:16.489> they<00:04:16.790> said<00:04:17.000> game

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
little bit longer they said game

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.820 
little bit longer they said game
might<00:04:17.910> have<00:04:18.030> gone<00:04:18.210> on<00:04:18.360> you<00:04:18.480> know<00:04:18.630> even<00:04:19.350> greater

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
might have gone on you know even greater

little triples Perez I would put me one

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.530 
little triples Perez I would put me one
kill<00:05:05.490> away<00:05:05.520> from<00:05:05.820> getting<00:05:06.000> the<00:05:06.120> lodestar

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
kill away from getting the lodestar

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:07.820 
kill away from getting the lodestar
again<00:05:06.840> which<00:05:07.140> you're<00:05:07.290> gonna<00:05:07.410> come<00:05:07.590> up<00:05:07.650> in<00:05:07.740> a

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
again which you're gonna come up in a

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.080 
again which you're gonna come up in a
second<00:05:08.220> and<00:05:08.370> now<00:05:08.460> this<00:05:08.580> is<00:05:08.730> on<00:05:08.850> the<00:05:08.910> last

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
second and now this is on the last

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.310 
second and now this is on the last
rotation<00:05:09.420> this<00:05:09.690> is<00:05:09.840> I<00:05:09.900> think<00:05:09.930> this<00:05:10.140> is<00:05:10.230> the

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
rotation this is I think this is the

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.140 
rotation this is I think this is the
last<00:05:10.440> load<00:05:10.680> staff<00:05:11.040> but<00:05:11.490> a<00:05:11.520> plot<00:05:11.940> that<00:05:11.970> how

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
last load staff but a plot that how

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.940 
last load staff but a plot that how
completely<00:05:12.630> cause<00:05:12.930> this<00:05:13.200> was<00:05:13.380> just<00:05:13.620> everyone

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
completely cause this was just everyone

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.800 
completely cause this was just everyone
in<00:05:14.070> the<00:05:14.160> building<00:05:14.310> and<00:05:14.730> that<00:05:14.760> lodestar<00:05:15.420> if<00:05:15.750> you

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
in the building and that lodestar if you

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.110 
in the building and that lodestar if you
think<00:05:15.960> I<00:05:16.020> got<00:05:16.170> one<00:05:16.320> kill<00:05:16.530> with<00:05:16.710> it<00:05:16.860> so<00:05:17.460> listen<00:05:17.880> I

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
think I got one kill with it so listen I

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.540 
think I got one kill with it so listen I
another<00:05:18.390> but<00:05:19.020> this<00:05:19.500> is<00:05:19.680> another<00:05:19.890> beetle<00:05:20.280> this

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
another but this is another beetle this

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:21.920 
another but this is another beetle this
is<00:05:20.640> the<00:05:20.730> second<00:05:21.120> one<00:05:21.240> I<00:05:21.360> think<00:05:21.570> about<00:05:21.750> me<00:05:21.840> had

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
is the second one I think about me had

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.300 
is the second one I think about me had
two<00:05:22.080> in<00:05:22.230> this<00:05:22.320> game<00:05:22.560> so<00:05:22.770> this<00:05:22.920> is<00:05:23.010> another<00:05:23.190> one

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
two in this game so this is another one

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.890 
two in this game so this is another one
that<00:05:23.430> does<00:05:23.700> really<00:05:23.880> well<00:05:24.120> and<00:05:24.540> obviously<00:05:24.660> you

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
that does really well and obviously you

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.270 
that does really well and obviously you
can<00:05:25.020> tell<00:05:25.200> which<00:05:25.380> killstreaks<00:05:25.860> they're<00:05:26.070> out

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
can tell which killstreaks they're out

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.010 
can tell which killstreaks they're out
with<00:05:26.400> the<00:05:26.490> warship<00:05:26.880> and<00:05:27.030> the<00:05:27.120> world<00:05:27.300> status<00:05:27.840> I

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
with the warship and the world status I

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.540 
with the warship and the world status I
thought<00:05:28.320> I<00:05:28.380> think<00:05:28.710> I<00:05:28.800> might<00:05:28.950> just<00:05:29.130> block<00:05:29.400> out

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
thought I think I might just block out

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.520 
thought I think I might just block out
the<00:05:29.610> Lord<00:05:29.910> star<00:05:30.180> on<00:05:30.360> some<00:05:30.570> maps<00:05:30.750> I<00:05:31.050> don't<00:05:31.440> know

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
the Lord star on some maps I don't know

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:32.900 
the Lord star on some maps I don't know
maybe<00:05:31.710> try<00:05:31.980> the<00:05:32.010> lightning<00:05:32.400> strike<00:05:32.610> the<00:05:32.760> black

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910 
maybe try the lightning strike the black

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.520 
maybe try the lightning strike the black
bed<00:05:33.090> in<00:05:33.240> the<00:05:33.330> wash<00:05:33.480> it<00:05:33.720> that<00:05:34.260> might<00:05:34.380> be<00:05:34.410> a

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
bed in the wash it that might be a

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:35.960 
bed in the wash it that might be a
little<00:05:34.680> bit<00:05:34.860> better<00:05:34.980> cuz<00:05:35.310> I<00:05:35.640> don't<00:05:35.700> think<00:05:35.820> the

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 
little bit better cuz I don't think the

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.490 
little bit better cuz I don't think the
load<00:05:36.120> stars<00:05:36.420> really<00:05:36.780> prepared<00:05:37.110> for<00:05:37.170> this<00:05:37.290> map

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
load stars really prepared for this map

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.720 
load stars really prepared for this map
maybe<00:05:37.740> I<00:05:37.860> just<00:05:38.070> got<00:05:38.190> a<00:05:38.220> little<00:05:38.340> bit<00:05:38.520> unlucky

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:38.730 
maybe I just got a little bit unlucky

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.090 
maybe I just got a little bit unlucky
