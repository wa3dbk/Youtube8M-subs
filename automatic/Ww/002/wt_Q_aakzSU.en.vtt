 objects I'm going to show you, we're going to 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.729
 start with these earth blocks 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:24.750
 as you see here we are going to see in the way 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:28.020
 this earth flat flat earth and does not come out 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.640
 in block with three blocks of these we 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:36.119
 six steps come slaps is the earth 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:39.479
 green wool people on your right the block 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.570
 of with grass down ground and 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.580
 right orange wool and we get what 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.970
 it would be the east block that we are going through 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.670
 right now for example but with three of 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.869
 these do not know six steps of wearing 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.920
 the next brick block of stone 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.750
 with purple tint up does not come out 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.409
 the purple stone that if you have seen it 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.539
 in the rock that is there 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:08.149
 Well, that with three of those 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:12.379
 six steps with a block of land 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:16.370
 on top of a block of purple brick 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:18.830
 from this we already get the block with grass 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.420
 or like this but instead of vicks that 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.410
 down there that has as land the 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:27.100
 denver of that then blocks 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.740
 and with three of those always to see this is 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.560
 the character more or less like that of 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.569
 useful objects in quotation marks 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.270
 with four nuggets on it 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.880
 way we get a ring that a ring 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.890
 apart from this also serves us 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.220
