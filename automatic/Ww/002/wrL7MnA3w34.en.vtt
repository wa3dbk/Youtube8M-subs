00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.070
 hi guys from 6 and welcome to the new one 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.990
 episode of army of the week have 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.730
 known we talked about ganz and today 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.349
 instead they must speak of an anime of the 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.340
 last season I had spring 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:34.090
 2014 and this new anime is no gain 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.920
 no life green life we ​​say it was born as 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:40.000
 a light novel then had one 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.489
 transposition manga in 2013 and then it's from 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.220
 verdun anime thanks to my house there are 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:48.250
 Twelve episodes that tell the story 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.879
 a part of the story of a party 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.190
 of history 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.879
 then before talking about the plot though 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:58.150
 some of the characters appear inside 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:00.879
 of the non gamelife day we will have two 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:04.510
 characters that are now and shiloh are 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:08.290
 two brothers who share let 's say the 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:11.260
 net debt life means people who 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:14.549
 they have neither a work nor study makes 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:18.550
 nothing of life and these two 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:21.610
 essentially what they do play on the pc 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.770
 but i know this they play with the kind of 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.570
 I play it really very good 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.550
 in fact both have intelligence 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.150
 above the norm 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:35.500
 so they are very simple dates of genes 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:38.070
 and thanks to them two which is called blank 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.740
 they are essentially called unnamed 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.460
 they manage to win every game they play 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.750
 he comes 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.640
 it is given without any problems, perhaps 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.690
 time also with problems but manage to 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.950
 win it let's say with various tactics and 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.920
 this is precisely the topic comes 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:02.509
 treated in the 12 episodes of the series 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:04.100
 so let's talk a little bit about history 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.500
 main 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.090
 then these two boys live like i have 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.980
 already said in this apartment and am 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.319
 tired of life because because according 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.620
 them the real world is a poor game 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:22.580
 or a game that is not worth it 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:25.180
 live because a god boring perfect of 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:29.060
 another world that has only regulated 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.730
 from the game he decides to help the two 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:36.380
 boys air asveri lin in his world 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:39.380
 this world is a bit like one 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:43.640
 chessboard in fact there are 16 races 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:46.940
 these 16 breeds are cataloged by the 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:51.230
 their power and the boys to bring one 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:54.650
 minor girl or hands you then 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.489
 however it can be rendered as humanity 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.260
 perfect so guys want 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.380
 improve we say the conditions of the 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.060
 but you do so much 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:08.000
 different from what it could be 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.920
 I said a first approach with help 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.230
 substantial to these patients indeed 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:16.640
 decide to challenge the let's say who 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.670
 he had to take the title of le 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.010
 the current king had died and decided 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.739
 even to win this fight 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.829
 against this girl wanted the inter and 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:30.320
 kings both invent king and queen of 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:35.400
 this kingdom this kingdom comes 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:38.380
 initially we say governed with 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:42.670
 let's say not with much interest too 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:46.020
 because boys want mainly 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:49.450
 difficult all races but not 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:51.610
 destroy them in the way of destroying them 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.500
 as happened for example in ours 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.709
 previous I will tell you now but 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.380
 they want to combine all these races for 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:02.380
 then being able to face the only remaining god 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.599
 that would be ted we will propose some of the 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.750
 story behind this world 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:10.800
 this world initially had 16 gods 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.269
 C-day questors were always fighting 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:17.019
 they had sacrificed many of their own 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:20.370
 followers who then are many who 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:25.810
 there still belong 16 races and therefore 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:27.280
 among them a king a king was a god was 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.200
 survived in this regard what 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.620
 god and ted who managed to defeat 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:38.260
 all the gays and decided to impose ten 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:40.660
 rules that are valuable in English that 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.400
 are the rules and managed this world in 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.660
 this world everything is regulated as I have 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:48.969
 already mentioned by the game or if you want 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.610
 decide something for example 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:53.589
 appropriate a territory of the di 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.470
 some resource resources must 

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:58.680
 carry out a 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:02.550
 an ok game of any kind can be 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:05.150
 even a toss of a coin or one 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.350
 start chess at any game 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.480
 oriental and anything is enough 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.390
 a game you can't kill the 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:16.920
 so people ca n't kill anyone 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:19.080
 and what is decided in the game goes 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.420
 respected because it cannot be done 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.790
 otherwise the conditions that 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:26.460
 the game is placed must be respected 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:29.790
 and who for example city or coffin 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.860
 the game comes to lose a tooth and must 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.690
 being forced to submit to what has been 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.660
 decided at the beginning can not do 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:39.000
 otherwise effect 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:42.360
 my opinions assume that stoner is 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.950
 unanimous very beautiful and themed on 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:48.590
 natural in any case we speak of a 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:53.940
 another world and I must say that the vein of 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:55.950
 action and comic adventure makes person 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:06:02.550
 very interesting very fun from 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:05.700
 following is unanimous that it has several different ones 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:10.370
 points you bring the for example a one 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:13.440
 scene of maximum hype where you must 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:15.840
 fight for example 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:18.090
 recover the food crown of the 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:22.740
 human who so far for example to gods 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:25.010
 small we say small echoes scenes 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:29.040
 which however are fun to watch and 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:31.860
 they would laugh so much during the 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.900
 only 12 episodes are seen in the anime 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:37.290
 this says episodes we say treat 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:41.040
 holy a small part of history 

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:42.120
 of the light novelle of the manga however from 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.390
 what I know will be a second one 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.770
 season definitely in the future vi 

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:48.300
 I recommend watching this anime though 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:51.540
 you are interested 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:54.540
 let's say the genre of games in anime 

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:57.050
 or at least if you like ways 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:07:01.080
 supernatural where there are challenges 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:03.180
 in the challenges I tell you I consider this 

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:06.510
 anime one of the millions this year for 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:08.550
 the moment and surely you must 

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:11.460
 see it itself 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:14.320
 think you can restore at least a minimum 

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:16.690
 of interest may interest 

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:19.660
