00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.749 
blues of a drive from the hingga which
is<00:01:40.409> kind<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:40.920> similar<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.490> blues

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
is kind of similar to the blues

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.609 
is kind of similar to the blues
overdrive<00:01:42.240> but<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.600> gives<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.290> lot<00:01:43.409> more

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
overdrive but it gives a lot more

overdrive but it gives a lot more
options<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.130> choice<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.790> port<00:01:46.579> that's

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
options and choice that port that's

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.530 
options and choice that port that's
everything<00:01:47.850> oh<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:49.049> urn<00:01:49.759> this<00:01:50.759> becomes<00:01:51.390> a
