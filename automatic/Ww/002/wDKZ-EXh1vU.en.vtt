wait another cutscene now let's take
down<00:00:28.099> the<00:00:28.250> next<00:00:28.429> circuit

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.350 

okay<00:00:48.860> that's<00:00:49.280> over<00:00:51.550> let's<00:00:52.550> move<00:00:52.820> on<00:00:53.030> to<00:00:53.180> the
