hi<00:00:05.310> I'm<00:00:05.640> Michael<00:00:06.120> maida<00:00:06.330> and<00:00:06.600> this<00:00:07.230> is<00:00:07.470> the

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
hi I'm Michael maida and this is the

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.790 
hi I'm Michael maida and this is the
mechanism<00:00:08.069> of<00:00:08.580> prokaryotic<00:00:09.269> DNA<00:00:09.800> replication

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
mechanism of prokaryotic DNA replication

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.780 
mechanism of prokaryotic DNA replication
initiation<00:00:12.740> here<00:00:13.740> I<00:00:13.920> have<00:00:14.280> drawn<00:00:14.549> a

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
initiation here I have drawn a

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.439 
initiation here I have drawn a
prokaryotic<00:00:15.599> circular<00:00:16.260> DNA<00:00:16.850> the<00:00:17.850> first<00:00:18.180> step

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
prokaryotic circular DNA the first step

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:26.779 
prokaryotic circular DNA the first step
of<00:00:18.480> this<00:00:18.779> process<00:00:19.109> is<00:00:20.070> for<00:00:21.830> DNA<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:23.930> protein<00:00:25.789> to

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
of this process is for DNA a protein to

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.089 
of this process is for DNA a protein to
attach<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.689> DNA<00:00:28.230> box<00:00:28.670> located<00:00:29.670> on<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.359> DNA

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
attach to the DNA box located on the DNA

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.840 
attach to the DNA box located on the DNA
so<00:00:32.099> we<00:00:32.219> have<00:00:32.340> this<00:00:32.489> DNA<00:00:32.940> protein<00:00:34.850> attaching

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
so we have this DNA protein attaching

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.350 
so we have this DNA protein attaching
and<00:00:36.059> this<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.350> first<00:00:37.680> step<00:00:38.090> when<00:00:39.090> this

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
and this is the first step when this

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.220 
and this is the first step when this
happens<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.500> DNA<00:00:41.040> will<00:00:41.280> super<00:00:41.760> coil<00:00:42.230> causing

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
happens the DNA will super coil causing

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.740 
happens the DNA will super coil causing
these<00:00:43.860> DNA<00:00:44.520> B<00:00:44.850> boxes<00:00:45.890> to<00:00:46.890> melt<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.750> separate

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
these DNA B boxes to melt and separate

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.410 
these DNA B boxes to melt and separate
from<00:00:48.930> each<00:00:49.140> other<00:00:49.410> we<00:00:50.399> now<00:00:50.670> have<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.000> different

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
from each other we now have a different

00:00:51.420 --> 00:01:01.660 
from each other we now have a different
shape<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.289> DNA

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.740 

the<00:01:02.270> melting<00:01:02.860> has<00:01:03.860> caused<00:01:04.449> separation<00:01:05.449> of<00:01:05.630> the

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
the melting has caused separation of the

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.260 
the melting has caused separation of the
strands<00:01:06.290> however<00:01:07.100> this<00:01:07.460> is<00:01:07.670> what<00:01:07.850> we<00:01:08.000> want

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
strands however this is what we want

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.140 
strands however this is what we want
because<00:01:09.050> then<00:01:09.440> the<00:01:09.680> next<00:01:09.710> step<00:01:10.310> is<00:01:10.520> for<00:01:11.090> the

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
because then the next step is for the

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.100 
because then the next step is for the
hexameric

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
hexameric

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.040 
hexameric
helicase<00:01:13.010> to<00:01:13.369> come<00:01:13.610> in<00:01:13.820> and<00:01:14.060> attach<00:01:14.720> to<00:01:14.750> the

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
helicase to come in and attach to the

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:23.170 
helicase to come in and attach to the
openings

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.480 

now<00:01:23.810> that<00:01:24.020> the<00:01:24.170> hexameric<00:01:24.620> helicase<00:01:25.190> can

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
now that the hexameric helicase can

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.240 
now that the hexameric helicase can
attach<00:01:25.910> it<00:01:26.810> begins<00:01:27.380> to<00:01:27.680> unwind<00:01:28.340> the<00:01:29.150> DNA<00:01:29.390> in

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
attach it begins to unwind the DNA in

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.030 
attach it begins to unwind the DNA in
both<00:01:31.250> directions

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
both directions

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:40.620 
both directions
after<00:01:34.040> this<00:01:34.340> step<00:01:34.670> we<00:01:35.000> have<00:01:35.570> an<00:01:35.840> SSB<00:01:36.830> protein

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.750 

SSB<00:01:42.010> protein<00:01:43.990> that<00:01:44.990> attaches<00:01:45.710> to<00:01:46.250> these<00:01:46.430> now

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
SSB protein that attaches to these now

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.180 
SSB protein that attaches to these now
single<00:01:47.360> strands<00:01:47.900> to<00:01:48.380> make<00:01:48.560> sure<00:01:48.800> that<00:01:48.950> they<00:01:49.130> do

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
single strands to make sure that they do

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.590 
single strands to make sure that they do
not<00:01:49.460> form<00:01:49.820> any<00:01:50.110> secondary<00:01:51.110> structures<00:01:52.600> once

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
not form any secondary structures once

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.350 
not form any secondary structures once
this<00:01:53.870> has<00:01:54.080> all<00:01:54.290> taken<00:01:54.770> place<00:01:55.070> then<00:01:55.940> we<00:01:56.180> can

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
this has all taken place then we can

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.859 
this has all taken place then we can
have<00:01:56.540> an<00:01:56.660> RNA<00:01:57.200> primase<00:01:58.090> connected<00:01:59.090> to<00:01:59.300> an<00:01:59.390> RNA

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
have an RNA primase connected to an RNA

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:06.160 
have an RNA primase connected to an RNA
polymerase<00:02:00.910> come<00:02:01.910> in<00:02:02.979> RNA<00:02:03.979> primase<00:02:05.170> connected

to<00:02:06.350> an<00:02:06.410> RNA<00:02:06.800> polymerase<00:02:07.179> it<00:02:08.179> comes<00:02:08.660> in<00:02:08.929> and

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
to an RNA polymerase it comes in and

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.780 
to an RNA polymerase it comes in and
forms<00:02:10.310> a<00:02:10.570> primer<00:02:11.920> behind<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.280> helicase

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
forms a primer behind the helicase

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.420 
forms a primer behind the helicase
that's<00:02:14.120> still<00:02:14.420> unwinding<00:02:15.110> we<00:02:15.920> now<00:02:16.160> have<00:02:16.400> a

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
that's still unwinding we now have a

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.220 
that's still unwinding we now have a
primer<00:02:16.870> where<00:02:18.070> replication<00:02:19.070> can<00:02:19.340> begin<00:02:19.730> and

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
primer where replication can begin and

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.560 
primer where replication can begin and
this<00:02:21.230> is<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.620> process<00:02:22.190> of<00:02:22.400> how<00:02:23.590> DNA<00:02:25.360> protein<00:02:26.360> a
