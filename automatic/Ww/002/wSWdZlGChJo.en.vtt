00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.730 

another<00:00:30.360> feature<00:00:30.660> on<00:00:30.810> corn<00:00:31.170> for<00:00:31.289> amplifiers

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
another feature on corn for amplifiers

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.310 
another feature on corn for amplifiers
is<00:00:31.920> anything<00:00:32.879> that<00:00:33.059> makes<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.420> sound<00:00:33.629> so<00:00:34.199> this

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
is anything that makes a sound so this

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.140 
is anything that makes a sound so this
is<00:00:34.470> a<00:00:34.500> either<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.949> combo<00:00:35.460> like<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:35.879> or<00:00:36.120> a

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.150 
is a either a combo like this or a

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.520 
is a either a combo like this or a
speaker<00:00:36.480> cabinet<00:00:36.989> that<00:00:37.080> you're<00:00:37.230> going<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.379> see

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
speaker cabinet that you're going to see

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.579 
speaker cabinet that you're going to see
later<00:00:37.650> on<00:00:37.830> is<00:00:38.339> made<00:00:38.699> from<00:00:39.360> solid<00:00:39.960> pine

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:40.589 
later on is made from solid pine

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:45.770 
later on is made from solid pine
so<00:00:40.949> no<00:00:41.250> plywood<00:00:41.879> no<00:00:42.449> MDF<00:00:43.610> no<00:00:44.610> terrible<00:00:45.510> color

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
so no plywood no MDF no terrible color

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.299 
so no plywood no MDF no terrible color
board<00:00:46.140> like<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.440> get<00:00:46.559> on<00:00:46.650> some<00:00:46.829> really<00:00:47.129> cheap

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
board like you get on some really cheap

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.850 
board like you get on some really cheap
stuff<00:00:47.640> but<00:00:47.909> completely<00:00:48.390> solid<00:00:48.809> pine<00:00:49.049> and<00:00:49.350> I

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
stuff but completely solid pine and I

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.649 
stuff but completely solid pine and I
think<00:00:50.100> again<00:00:50.400> confered<00:00:51.269> ever<00:00:51.390> really

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:51.659 
think again confered ever really

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:53.030 
think again confered ever really
interesting<00:00:52.049> take<00:00:52.229> on<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.710> know<00:00:52.799> they

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
interesting take on this you know they

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.640 
interesting take on this you know they
look<00:00:53.430> at<00:00:53.580> guitars<00:00:54.119> like<00:00:54.540> you<00:00:54.780> know<00:00:54.900> Les<00:00:55.350> Paul's

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:55.650 
look at guitars like you know Les Paul's

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.500 
look at guitars like you know Les Paul's
and<00:00:55.860> strats<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.400> everybody<00:00:56.760> concedes<00:00:57.180> that

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
and strats and everybody concedes that

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.420 
and strats and everybody concedes that
using<00:00:57.809> solid<00:00:58.229> wood<00:00:58.409> is<00:00:58.559> absolutely<00:00:59.159> the<00:00:59.250> best

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
using solid wood is absolutely the best

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.210 
using solid wood is absolutely the best
way<00:00:59.580> to<00:00:59.729> get<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.960> most<00:01:01.170> resonant<00:01:01.559> tone<00:01:01.860> it

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 
way to get the most resonant tone it

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.979 
way to get the most resonant tone it
rings<00:01:02.430> accurately<00:01:03.119> like<00:01:03.269> a<00:01:03.299> bell<00:01:03.540> doesn't<00:01:03.780> it

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
rings accurately like a bell doesn't it

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.660 
rings accurately like a bell doesn't it
I<00:01:04.080> made<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.439> bail<00:01:04.710> from<00:01:04.979> one<00:01:05.189> piece<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.549> material

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
I made a bail from one piece of material

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.609 
I made a bail from one piece of material
ring<00:01:06.210> yeah<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.840> if<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:06.990> make<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.290> from<00:01:07.439> many

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
ring yeah and if you make it from many

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.200 
ring yeah and if you make it from many
pieces<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:08.010> material<00:01:08.369> they<00:01:08.520> try<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.760> get<00:01:09.060> they

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
pieces of material they try to get they

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.420 
pieces of material they try to get they
hit<00:01:09.450> each<00:01:09.659> other<00:01:09.840> done<00:01:10.080> yeah<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.619> so<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:11.310> they

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
hit each other done yeah and so so they

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.060 
hit each other done yeah and so so they
take<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.790> view<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.409> using<00:01:13.409> solid<00:01:13.710> words<00:01:13.890> on

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
take the view that using solid words on

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.740 
take the view that using solid words on
their<00:01:14.250> cabinets<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:14.909> really<00:01:15.180> important<00:01:15.630> and

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
their cabinets is really important and

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.660 
their cabinets is really important and
and<00:01:16.140> corporate<00:01:16.740> will<00:01:16.890> tell<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.520> if<00:01:17.580> you

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
and corporate will tell you and if you

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.580 
and corporate will tell you and if you
ever<00:01:17.790> get<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.030> chance<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.390> do<00:01:18.540> this<00:01:18.689> take<00:01:19.290> your

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
ever get the chance to do this take your

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.590 
ever get the chance to do this take your
head<00:01:20.400> whether<00:01:20.850> you've<00:01:21.060> got<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.480> know<00:01:21.510> a

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
head whether you've got a you know a

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.870 
head whether you've got a you know a
bougie<00:01:22.200> hair<00:01:22.410> or<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.590> PD<00:01:22.950> header<00:01:23.130> or<00:01:23.340> Marshall

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
bougie hair or a PD header or Marshall

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.640 
bougie hair or a PD header or Marshall
head<00:01:24.030> or<00:01:24.150> whatever<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.720> try<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.320> throw<00:01:25.620> a

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
head or whatever and try it throw a

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.680 
head or whatever and try it throw a
Cornford<00:01:26.100> cabinet<00:01:26.550> because<00:01:27.270> even<00:01:27.540> if<00:01:27.630> you

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
Cornford cabinet because even if you

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.090 
Cornford cabinet because even if you
can't<00:01:27.900> afford<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.230> amplifier<00:01:28.590> maybe<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:28.980> can

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
can't afford the amplifier maybe you can

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.590 
can't afford the amplifier maybe you can
afford<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.430> cabinet<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:29.910> it<00:01:30.030> does<00:01:30.270> make<00:01:30.570> a

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
afford the cabinet and it does make a

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:49.340 
afford the cabinet and it does make a
big<00:01:30.780> difference<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.530> time

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:02:10.669 

Oh

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.130 

I<00:02:10.849> guess<00:02:11.849> one<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.150> advantages<00:02:12.659> conferred

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
I guess one of the advantages conferred

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.020 
I guess one of the advantages conferred
have<00:02:13.319> by<00:02:13.620> pricing<00:02:14.189> all<00:02:14.310> of<00:02:14.430> their<00:02:14.579> amplifiers

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
have by pricing all of their amplifiers

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.809 
have by pricing all of their amplifiers
as<00:02:15.209> kind<00:02:15.689> of<00:02:15.780> fairly<00:02:16.230> top-end<00:02:16.620> amplifiers<00:02:17.340> is

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
as kind of fairly top-end amplifiers is

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.819 
as kind of fairly top-end amplifiers is
they're<00:02:18.000> not<00:02:18.150> they're<00:02:18.750> not<00:02:18.780> interested<00:02:19.650> in

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
they're not they're not interested in

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.309 
they're not they're not interested in
any<00:02:20.370> kind<00:02:20.760> of<00:02:20.849> manufacturing<00:02:21.569> technique<00:02:22.049> that

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
any kind of manufacturing technique that

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.559 
any kind of manufacturing technique that
saves<00:02:22.620> two<00:02:23.069> pounds<00:02:23.549> or<00:02:23.670> three<00:02:23.879> pounds<00:02:24.120> or<00:02:24.390> five

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
saves two pounds or three pounds or five

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.289 
saves two pounds or three pounds or five
years<00:02:25.790> companies<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:27.090> are<00:02:27.209> making

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
years companies that are making

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.780 
years companies that are making
thousands<00:02:28.019> of<00:02:28.140> amplifiers<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.709> year<00:02:29.010> will

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
thousands of amplifiers a year will

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.240 
thousands of amplifiers a year will
we'll<00:02:30.329> look<00:02:30.629> to<00:02:30.900> save<00:02:31.170> those<00:02:31.470> two<00:02:31.739> pounds<00:02:32.159> and

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
we'll look to save those two pounds and

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.440 
we'll look to save those two pounds and
three<00:02:32.459> pounds<00:02:32.819> because<00:02:32.909> after<00:02:33.180> you've<00:02:33.269> made

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
three pounds because after you've made

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.449 
three pounds because after you've made
ten<00:02:33.720> thousand<00:02:34.109> amplifiers<00:02:34.530> that<00:02:34.890> saving<00:02:35.310> is<00:02:35.400> a

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
ten thousand amplifiers that saving is a

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.789 
ten thousand amplifiers that saving is a
massive<00:02:35.939> saving<00:02:36.290> Cornford<00:02:37.290> don't<00:02:37.500> work<00:02:37.650> like

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
massive saving Cornford don't work like

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.610 
massive saving Cornford don't work like
that<00:02:37.859> at<00:02:38.040> all<00:02:38.250> so<00:02:38.519> the<00:02:39.359> way<00:02:39.480> that<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:40.109> baffle

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
done to make the amp sound the best it

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.559 
done to make the amp sound the best it
can<00:02:53.069> sound<00:02:53.280> some<00:02:53.790> people<00:02:54.120> might<00:02:54.299> not<00:02:54.420> know

what<00:02:54.690> a<00:02:54.720> baffle<00:02:55.230> is<00:02:55.439> do<00:02:56.010> you<00:02:56.069> wanna<00:02:56.280> briefly

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
what a baffle is do you wanna briefly

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.839 
what a baffle is do you wanna briefly
talk<00:02:56.909> about<00:02:56.939> it<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:58.049> baffle<00:02:58.470> is<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:59.250> piece<00:02:59.670> of

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
talk about it the baffle is the piece of

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.160 
talk about it the baffle is the piece of
wood<00:03:00.060> that<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.510> speaker<00:03:01.109> is<00:03:01.139> mounted<00:03:01.680> to<00:03:01.709> and

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
wood that the speaker is mounted to and

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.300 
wood that the speaker is mounted to and
depending<00:03:04.170> on<00:03:04.230> whether<00:03:04.439> you<00:03:04.560> front<00:03:04.889> mount<00:03:05.159> the

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
depending on whether you front mount the

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.160 
depending on whether you front mount the
speaker<00:03:05.730> or<00:03:05.879> you<00:03:05.970> reroute<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.599> speaker<00:03:07.019> and

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
speaker or you reroute the speaker and

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.339 
speaker or you reroute the speaker and
the<00:03:07.319> way<00:03:07.470> in<00:03:07.620> which<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:07.950> speaker<00:03:08.370> is<00:03:09.170> cut<00:03:10.170> just

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
the way in which the speaker is cut just

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.589 
the way in which the speaker is cut just
attached<00:03:11.010> into<00:03:11.459> the<00:03:11.579> cabinet<00:03:12.090> will<00:03:12.480> all

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
attached into the cabinet will all

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:14.990 
attached into the cabinet will all
affect<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.079> tone<00:03:13.400> basically<00:03:14.400> sorry<00:03:14.730> to<00:03:14.819> cut

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
affect the tone basically sorry to cut

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.199 
affect the tone basically sorry to cut
in<00:03:15.150> there<00:03:15.379> basically<00:03:16.379> if<00:03:17.010> you<00:03:17.220> reroute<00:03:17.819> a

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
in there basically if you reroute a

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.530 
in there basically if you reroute a
speaker<00:03:18.780> you<00:03:19.290> get<00:03:19.440> a<00:03:19.470> very<00:03:19.709> directional<00:03:20.540> field

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
speaker you get a very directional field

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.979 
speaker you get a very directional field
of<00:03:21.660> sound<00:03:22.220> and<00:03:23.220> if<00:03:23.699> you<00:03:23.879> fragment<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.629> speaker

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
of sound and if you fragment the speaker

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.159 
of sound and if you fragment the speaker
you<00:03:25.139> get<00:03:25.290> more<00:03:25.530> of<00:03:25.590> a<00:03:25.680> wide<00:03:25.980> spread<00:03:26.430> of<00:03:27.019> it<00:03:28.019> is<00:03:28.139> a

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:28.169 
you get more of a wide spread of it is a

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:30.170 
you get more of a wide spread of it is a
believe<00:03:28.829> it<00:03:28.919> or<00:03:28.980> not<00:03:29.099> if<00:03:29.280> I<00:03:29.340> can<00:03:29.519> do<00:03:29.639> this<00:03:29.730> in<00:03:29.909> 10

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
believe it or not if I can do this in 10

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.809 
believe it or not if I can do this in 10
seconds<00:03:30.599> if<00:03:31.500> you<00:03:31.560> imagine<00:03:31.859> the<00:03:32.129> baffle<00:03:32.549> on<00:03:32.699> an

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
seconds if you imagine the baffle on an

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.240 
seconds if you imagine the baffle on an
amplifier<00:03:33.239> is<00:03:33.480> say<00:03:33.690> half<00:03:34.079> an<00:03:34.199> inch<00:03:34.319> thick<00:03:34.409> and

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
amplifier is say half an inch thick and

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.610 
amplifier is say half an inch thick and
you<00:03:35.790> really<00:03:36.150> mount<00:03:36.359> the<00:03:36.510> speaker<00:03:36.959> what

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
you really mount the speaker what

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.860 
you really mount the speaker what
happens<00:03:38.069> is<00:03:38.190> you<00:03:38.340> create<00:03:38.760> like<00:03:39.239> a<00:03:39.269> half<00:03:39.599> inch

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
happens is you create like a half inch

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.409 
happens is you create like a half inch
deep<00:03:40.409> tunnel<00:03:41.099> like<00:03:41.280> a<00:03:41.310> trumpet<00:03:41.760> yeah<00:03:42.120> there

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:42.419 
deep tunnel like a trumpet yeah there

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:44.659 
deep tunnel like a trumpet yeah there
the<00:03:42.510> sound<00:03:42.659> to<00:03:42.870> go<00:03:43.019> through<00:03:43.349> so<00:03:43.829> actually<00:03:44.310> as

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:44.669 
the sound to go through so actually as

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:46.430 
the sound to go through so actually as
soon<00:03:45.000> as<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.299> sound<00:03:45.479> comes<00:03:45.750> out<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:46.019> speaker

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
soon as the sound comes out the speaker

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.610 
soon as the sound comes out the speaker
it's<00:03:46.799> instantly<00:03:47.519> sort<00:03:48.269> of<00:03:48.359> can<00:03:48.870> find<00:03:49.290> and

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
it's instantly sort of can find and

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.500 
it's instantly sort of can find and
channeled<00:03:50.040> by<00:03:50.220> this<00:03:50.280> this<00:03:51.000> tunnel

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
channeled by this this tunnel

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.360 
channeled by this this tunnel
if<00:03:51.629> you<00:03:51.870> front<00:03:52.109> down<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.409> speaker<00:03:52.769> which<00:03:53.099> in

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
if you front down the speaker which in

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.030 
if you front down the speaker which in
real<00:03:53.549> terms<00:03:53.760> costs<00:03:54.329> a<00:03:54.479> little<00:03:54.780> bit<00:03:54.989> more<00:03:55.139> a<00:03:55.680> few

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
real terms costs a little bit more a few

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.289 
real terms costs a little bit more a few
pounds<00:03:56.430> more<00:03:56.639> because<00:03:56.849> it<00:03:56.970> takes<00:03:57.120> a<00:03:57.209> little

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
pounds more because it takes a little

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.780 
pounds more because it takes a little
bit<00:03:57.449> longer<00:03:57.629> than<00:03:57.930> two<00:03:58.169> to<00:03:58.669> assemble<00:03:59.669> the

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
bit longer than two to assemble the

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.839 
bit longer than two to assemble the
cabinet<00:04:00.079> you<00:04:01.079> don't<00:04:01.979> get<00:04:02.220> that<00:04:02.370> tunnel<00:04:02.790> effect

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
cabinet you don't get that tunnel effect

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:05.390 
cabinet you don't get that tunnel effect
so<00:04:03.299> it's<00:04:03.659> much<00:04:04.169> why<00:04:04.889> they're<00:04:05.190> sort<00:04:05.370> of

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
so it's much why they're sort of

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.789 
so it's much why they're sort of
standing<00:04:05.669> for<00:04:06.299> a<00:04:06.329> wall<00:04:06.540> 12<00:04:06.870> that's<00:04:07.260> a<00:04:07.379> really

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
standing for a wall 12 that's a really

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.319 
standing for a wall 12 that's a really
important<00:04:08.220> thing<00:04:08.250> that's<00:04:08.579> if<00:04:09.030> you've<00:04:09.180> had<00:04:09.299> a

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
important thing that's if you've had a

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:10.430 
important thing that's if you've had a
gig<00:04:09.629> with<00:04:09.780> the<00:04:09.810> 112

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
gig with the 112

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.199 
gig with the 112
it's<00:04:10.919> a<00:04:11.099> nightmare<00:04:11.790> if<00:04:11.970> you've<00:04:12.090> got<00:04:12.180> a

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
it's a nightmare if you've got a

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.119 
it's a nightmare if you've got a
background<00:04:12.479> speaker<00:04:13.409> your<00:04:13.620> drummer<00:04:13.859> can't

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
background speaker your drummer can't

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:15.289 
background speaker your drummer can't
hear<00:04:14.310> you<00:04:14.370> unless<00:04:14.430> you've<00:04:14.669> got<00:04:14.760> good<00:04:14.940> flow

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
hear you unless you've got good flow

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:16.699 
hear you unless you've got good flow
monitoring<00:04:15.720> which<00:04:16.139> is<00:04:16.260> probably<00:04:16.560> running

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
monitoring which is probably running

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.439 
monitoring which is probably running
kind<00:04:17.010> of<00:04:17.099> yourself<00:04:17.579> yeah<00:04:17.699> more<00:04:17.970> important<00:04:18.269> you

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
kind of yourself yeah more important you

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:19.240 
kind of yourself yeah more important you
cut<00:04:18.690> yourself

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
cut yourself

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.340 
cut yourself
just<00:04:19.549> as<00:04:19.670> new<00:04:19.820> kind<00:04:20.060> off<00:04:20.209> to<00:04:20.329> the<00:04:20.420> side<00:04:20.600> here<00:04:20.930> in

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
just as new kind off to the side here in

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.790 
just as new kind off to the side here in
fact<00:04:21.590> you<00:04:21.709> can't<00:04:21.980> hear<00:04:22.160> them<00:04:22.310> coming<00:04:22.640> up
