00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
works

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.090 
works
yep<00:00:35.309> two<00:00:35.820> claws<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.450> go<00:00:37.260> into<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.620> strike<00:00:37.920> of

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
yep two claws that go into the strike of

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.080 
yep two claws that go into the strike of
the<00:00:38.129> door<00:00:38.340> mm-hmm<00:00:39.030> close<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.750> door<00:00:40.850> and<00:00:41.850> you

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
the door mm-hmm close the door and you

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.540 
the door mm-hmm close the door and you
have<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.239> moving<00:00:42.600> rod<00:00:42.809> here<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.710> goes<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.489> you

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
have a moving rod here it goes and you

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.970 
have a moving rod here it goes and you
just<00:00:44.760> drop<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.270> mm-hmm<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.200> that's<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.770> and

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
just drop it mm-hmm and that's it and

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.650 
just drop it mm-hmm and that's it and
the<00:00:47.190> reason<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.610> triangular<00:00:48.300> shape<00:00:48.480> is

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
the reason the triangular shape is

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.450 
the reason the triangular shape is
because<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:49.020> takes<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.649> drops<00:00:49.920> down<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.309> two

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
because it takes it drops down and two

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.889 
because it takes it drops down and two
little<00:00:50.700> catches<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.120> door<00:00:51.300> it's<00:00:51.660> just<00:00:51.690> a

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
little catches the door it's just a

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.510 
little catches the door it's just a
thinner<00:00:52.079> door<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.379> think<00:00:52.530> at<00:00:52.680> all<00:00:52.800> that's<00:00:53.309> it

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
thinner door I think at all that's it

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.760 
thinner door I think at all that's it
and<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.270> beauty<00:00:54.510> about<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:55.350> can't<00:00:55.620> open

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
and the beauty about it you can't open

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.590 
and the beauty about it you can't open
the<00:00:56.010> door<00:00:56.190> at<00:00:56.370> all<00:00:56.520> against<00:00:57.360> all<00:00:57.480> the

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
the door at all against all the

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.080 
the door at all against all the
different<00:00:57.930> chains<00:00:58.460> I'm<00:00:59.460> on<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.699> other<00:00:59.789> side

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
different chains I'm on the other side

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.000 
different chains I'm on the other side
on<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.390> side<00:01:00.629> yep<00:01:00.899> that's<00:01:01.230> right<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.859> door

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
on the side yep that's right so the door

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.719 
on the side yep that's right so the door
doesn't<00:01:02.039> open<00:01:02.340> at<00:01:02.609> all<00:01:05.119> until<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.150> say<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:07.729> so

the back between the door and the frame

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.760 
the back between the door and the frame
you<00:02:09.629> need<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:09.929> make<00:02:10.110> sure<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.560> have<00:02:10.679> the

it's using the actual front lift door

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.600 
it's using the actual front lift door
inside<00:02:34.080> here<00:02:34.319> is<00:02:34.379> actually<00:02:34.650> metal<00:02:34.980> so<00:02:35.160> the

inside here is actually metal so the

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.979 
inside here is actually metal so the
strength<00:02:35.910> of<00:02:36.060> it<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.330> this<00:02:36.420> is<00:02:36.569> to<00:02:36.690> protect

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
strength of it and this is to protect
