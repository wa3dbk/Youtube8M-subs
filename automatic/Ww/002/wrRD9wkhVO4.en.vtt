$53<00:03:21.130> I<00:03:21.250> think<00:03:21.489> but<00:03:21.910> I'd<00:03:22.030> hot<00:03:22.239> cash<00:03:22.480> that's<00:03:22.780> 25

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
$53 I think but I'd hot cash that's 25

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.070 
$53 I think but I'd hot cash that's 25
off<00:03:23.320> and<00:03:23.530> then<00:03:23.680> I<00:03:23.709> had<00:03:24.040> ten<00:03:24.370> dollars<00:03:24.610> off

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
off and then I had ten dollars off

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.240 
off and then I had ten dollars off
because<00:03:26.080> of<00:03:26.110> the<00:03:26.260> tort<00:03:26.500> insider<00:03:26.830> so<00:03:27.100> these

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
because of the tort insider so these

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.130 
because of the tort insider so these
haven't<00:03:27.550> been<00:03:27.610> $23<00:03:28.390> so<00:03:28.600> that's<00:03:28.750> not<00:03:28.870> bad<00:03:29.110> at

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.460 
haven't been $23 so that's not bad at
all<00:03:30.300> and<00:03:31.300> i<00:03:31.390> think<00:03:31.720> that's<00:03:31.989> it<00:03:32.170> that<00:03:32.440> was

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470
