00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:27.390
 swell is stationary and wind 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.769
 who will do this lunch on which we re 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.090
 hello to all in one time 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.740
 which is variable a temperature 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.450
 outside at 21 22 degrees a 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.800
 water temperature to 18 degrees and a 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.660
 marsh which is currently in the process of 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.510
 get off the glitter at 2:10 pm 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.040
 with coefficients of the 79 sure this 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.260
 going down the wind turns there goes with 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.450
 a southern sector is south south-east times 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.100
 he reinforce himself to two words be 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.660
 restores small bursts to three on 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.300
 has a body of water on the open sea which is 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.980
 flanged to a little chop comfort that 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.449
 becomes a little wrinkled makes them waves 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.070
 rastelli it's always this water or the 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.360
 which is long with in the second half 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.879
 a swell is oriented north west 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.440
 west which is sectioned now and 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.930
 who will park size relative to 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.369
 this morning surf reduced to 80 cm at 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.560
 born at most flagship series at 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.790
 put 20 and from time to time he drags 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.770
 still Syrians can no longer 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.700
 great sahara m 30 but relatively 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.200
 rare 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.509
 I looked at the sea ​​during a 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.220
 half hour I saw only one island this 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.439
 morning I went surfing I saw one 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.840
 in an hour and a half so most of the 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.580
 time do this m 20 and some series 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.080
 from time to time good 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.430
 section is a bit fast it's in 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.020
 degrading you see the wind 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.780
 south knowing that the swell 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.790
 good shoulders are competing shoulders 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.320
 semi hollow is a little faster 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.720
 but on a good ben it does not happen to 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.189
 maintain a little held a debate that 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.180
 are easy to access who censor fable 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.710
 in small as big boards 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.970
 evolution for the rest of the day that 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.430
 there is the drink cash we start to 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.049
 go down a little 1 41 seconds 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.420
 you will have to decrease a bit 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.799
 end of the day we are wrong at 13h in 80 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.450
 some series beyond or the 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.100
 west / northwest round second period 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.259
 wind from south southeast to 2.3 beaufort and to 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.149
 17h to put 20 or the west do 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.530
 responsible for period with the wind that 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.390
 returns a shorts southwest and that 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.790
 should calm down in Beaufort to 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.740
 monitor the end of tide on the end of 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.810
 day on the rising tide 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:12.150
 this is the postponement of this myth 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:16.430
 then focus on 08 92 29 78 73 to 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.430
 14h to 16h and 18h ​​ners 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.080
 no
