00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:12.620
 The psychic photos of the Osaka Sakai Baseball Club are on the Internet 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:19.230
 I tried to find out the truth 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:26.470
 This photo is at the final of the 2013 summer tournament in Osaka 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:31.940
 It was a picture of the moment I decided to enter Koshien after defeating Koshimasa. 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:35.980
 Next to the left knee of the 14th player in the lower left of the photo 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:38.020
 You can see the human hand clearly 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:42.120
 About this photo 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:47.010
 Osaka no longer wins the championship 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:51.680
 Watch out for injuries of the number 14 player left foot of 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.680
 Has raised the voice of the echo, which said that a mystery 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:01:00.020
 When I examined this psychic photograph, the truth became clear 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:06.940
 on youtube 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:11.950
 Video called Osaka 桐 蔭 bess Koshosha digest has been uploaded 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:15.659
 In the scene from around 18 minutes 10 seconds of this animation 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:19.440
 Osaka Tatsumi and benefits decide the victory 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:23.130
 It is a scene that players rush to mound 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:28.270
 Behind the leftmost player # 14 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:35.040
 I can see that one player is falling down 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:41.190
 At this time the camera fell down and caught only the player's left hand . 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:47.130
 It is supposed that not only the left hand but also the whole is originally reflected 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:52.670
 I think this kind of image may be at the moment of the shutter 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:02:00.680
 It seems that only this image is not a psychic photograph 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:02:03.280
 It says the camera could not capture the complete human beings to move was the truth of this psychic photo 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.280
 It seems
