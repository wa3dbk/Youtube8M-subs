 associated 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.739
 On the other hand we can connect with the naturalist in different ways 

00:00:09.739 --> 00:00:12.559
 who has something to show us about 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.559
 direct of martinis of which one spoke free 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:17.359
 here it is 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.939
 I find myself an American citizen of the coast 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.480
 cause with some very interesting poles 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.820
 exactly 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.079
 the skeletons 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:28.890
 2 3 pounds really awesome 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:29.880

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.949
 we love 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.780
 this very long spine belongs to a mosasaur a reptile 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.490
 huge marine almost 10 meters long 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.150
 he was a close relative of the current varans 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.310
 let's say 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.510
 - water varano standards to come 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.300
 shallow of the time 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.490
 its tail was very long and very flat 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:03.950
 and this allowed 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.230
 to the sauro muse to swim common serpentine minds 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.740

 a bit like those of ducks 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.890
 and all this suggests that mosasaurus was an excellent swimmer 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.240
 but what is most impressive are its jaws 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.880
 there are teeth r huge conical sharp they must avaaz to the sea the prey 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.130

 break it with a luscious headrest and then swallow it without chewing it thanks 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.750
 also to these teeth that you see here at the bottom of the palate 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.190
 what feeds vat the motorbikes use well practically of all that 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.670
 it happened within range 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.410
 inside their skeletons have been found 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.910
