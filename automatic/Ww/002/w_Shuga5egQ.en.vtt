00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
 ramÃ³n espinel 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:08.389
 I am sad brain and today I bring you a 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.120
 tutorial to have the voices the league 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:13.460
 of legends in Korean but first 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.450
 I want to thank the more than 500 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:19.970
 people who have subscribed to my channel 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:26.020
 and those who have already shared 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:26.020
 I already like the cat 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.939
 And now we go for the tutorial 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.180
 first thing we should do is download 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:37.250
 the sound files in Korean for 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.840
 that we're going to go to the container folder 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.650
 from our league of legends 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:47.940
 then to rats system and we open the 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:54.790
 local cfg file and we replace the 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:57.790
 cleanliness under bush by here or jon low k r 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.360
 we keep them and open our league 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.360
 of legends 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.740
 which will be updated and downloaded 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.970
 the voices and all the sounds of a 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.420
 heart 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.640
 I already have it downloaded so it's 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.210
 after downloading the files we are going to 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:19.260
 close our ligaments legend let's go 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.260
 back to the folder 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.220
 let's go to rats project 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:32.689
 and we will find a new folder 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:34.770
 called the game client script under 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:39.060
 fall out 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.070
 we open the folder we go to manager files 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.750
 and here we will look for the folder with the 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:48.000
 number greater and containing the sounds 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:51.260
 for this we are going to go reviewing first 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.740
 let's go to the with the highest number 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:57.850
 in this case it is 82 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.770
 we will give 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.259
 and here should appear both 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.900
 folders one called menu and another 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:07.780
 It's called sounds, it does not have it that way 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.590
 let's go to the next folder 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.590
 with the highest number 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:20.750
 now let's go into the sans folder 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:23.930
 we will find the folder f mod 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.340
 and we will find two files which 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.709
 we need is 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.709
 let's copy this file 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.200
 and we will return to our folder 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:38.209
 project and now let's go into the 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.040
 folder that contains the sounds in 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:44.280
 English from our league of legends 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.769
 then again to managed file and 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.689
 we must do exactly the same as 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.760
 we did previously find the 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:53.299
 folder with a higher number and containing 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.299
 the sounds 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.990
 and if we find the folder they are then 

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:08.690
 mod efe 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.740
 and we found the sound bank in 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.510
 English 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:17.390
 so here we are going to paste 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.390
 our sound bank in Korean 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.550
 and now what we should do is that the 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:27.160
 Korean sound bank have the 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.160
 name of the sound bank in English 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:40.730
 we must not forget to leave our 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:44.450
 local file point cfg 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:48.500
 with the game data in English 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:50.330
 well we will return to the time we are going to 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.650
 system 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.550
 we open our file we start the
