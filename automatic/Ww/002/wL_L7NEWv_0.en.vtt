i think the chemistry is a very good
spot<00:01:55.829> player<00:01:56.070> as<00:01:56.250> well<00:01:56.600> but<00:01:57.600> as<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:58.140> can<00:01:58.469> see

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.310 
that uh hi TMR there veamonos to see
Mars<00:03:08.430> such<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:08.730> weird<00:03:09.060> weapon<00:03:09.900> that<00:03:10.080> when<00:03:10.230> you

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
Mars such a weird weapon that when you

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.690 
Mars such a weird weapon that when you
pull<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.590> trigger<00:03:10.740> it<00:03:11.010> doesn't<00:03:11.310> react<00:03:11.550> as

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
pull the trigger it doesn't react as

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.060 
pull the trigger it doesn't react as
fast<00:03:11.970> as<00:03:12.150> a<00:03:12.180> magnum<00:03:12.630> or<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.840> BR<00:03:13.200> so<00:03:13.770> that's

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
fast as a magnum or the BR so that's

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.949 
fast as a magnum or the BR so that's
definitely<00:03:14.310> a<00:03:14.520> Down<00:03:14.730> flaw<00:03:15.000> with<00:03:15.180> him<00:03:15.330> with<00:03:15.780> the

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
definitely a Down flaw with him with the

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.770 
definitely a Down flaw with him with the
the<00:03:16.650> DMR<00:03:17.100> and<00:03:17.370> he's<00:03:17.910> got<00:03:18.090> a<00:03:18.120> really<00:03:18.660> good

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
the DMR and he's got a really good

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.979 
the DMR and he's got a really good
positioning<00:03:19.680> right<00:03:19.920> now<00:03:20.510> she<00:03:21.510> was<00:03:21.600> my<00:03:21.690> brother

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
positioning right now she was my brother

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.140 
positioning right now she was my brother
right<00:03:22.260> underneath<00:03:23.070> that<00:03:23.340> map<00:03:23.550> and<00:03:23.820> just<00:03:23.970> goes

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
right underneath that map and just goes

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.630 
right underneath that map and just goes
right<00:03:24.270> into<00:03:24.600> ring<00:03:24.930> one<00:03:25.170> which<00:03:25.380> is<00:03:25.560> really<00:03:26.340> good

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
right into ring one which is really good

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.510 
right into ring one which is really good
I<00:03:27.330> don't<00:03:28.020> think<00:03:28.080> about<00:03:28.470> me<00:03:28.709> favor<00:03:28.950> you<00:03:29.190> ready

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
I don't think about me favor you ready

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.880 
I don't think about me favor you ready
for<00:03:29.760> this<00:03:29.910> even<00:03:30.840> though<00:03:30.989> red<00:03:31.260> team<00:03:31.470> is<00:03:31.650> winning

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
for this even though red team is winning

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.940 
for this even though red team is winning
a<00:03:32.190> lot<00:03:33.380> the<00:03:34.380> way<00:03:34.560> that<00:03:36.080> downpour<00:03:37.080> Isis<00:03:37.620> as<00:03:37.770> she

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
a lot the way that downpour Isis as she

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.770 
a lot the way that downpour Isis as she
going<00:03:38.160> around<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.489> map<00:03:38.640> is<00:03:38.820> really<00:03:39.269> really

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
going around the map is really really

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.560 
going around the map is really really
good<00:03:40.110> I<00:03:40.380> think<00:03:41.250> most<00:03:41.459> people<00:03:41.790> should

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
good I think most people should

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.840 
good I think most people should
definitely<00:03:42.989> get<00:03:43.170> in<00:03:43.440> this<00:03:43.980> position<00:03:44.580> if<00:03:44.730> you

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
definitely get in this position if you

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.820 
definitely get in this position if you
want<00:03:45.090> to<00:03:45.209> control<00:03:46.940> most<00:03:47.940> of<00:03:48.120> this<00:03:48.959> map<00:03:49.290> I<00:03:49.530> think

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
want to control most of this map I think

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.680 
want to control most of this map I think
the<00:03:50.010> centerpieces<00:03:50.910> are<00:03:51.060> definitely<00:03:51.480> great

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
the centerpieces are definitely great

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.840 
the centerpieces are definitely great
ring<00:03:52.110> wandering<00:03:52.560> to<00:03:52.769> in<00:03:52.950> especially<00:03:53.640> ring

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.500 
three they're all really good a little
bit<00:03:58.650> it<00:03:59.010> looks<00:03:59.190> like<00:03:59.250> downpour<00:04:00.000> didn't<00:04:00.300> really

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
bit it looks like downpour didn't really

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.960 
bit it looks like downpour didn't really
have<00:04:00.720> much<00:04:00.750> of<00:04:01.019> a<00:04:01.610> didn't<00:04:02.610> really<00:04:02.790> have<00:04:02.940> much

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.909 
just by watching how other people play I
know<00:04:43.380> how<00:04:43.680> how<00:04:44.099> like<00:04:44.520> other<00:04:44.789> people<00:04:45.060> play<00:04:45.300> and

know how how like other people play and

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.439 
know how how like other people play and
sometimes<00:04:46.919> it's<00:04:47.310> predictable<00:04:47.880> and<00:04:48.090> sometimes

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:48.449 
sometimes it's predictable and sometimes

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:49.760 
sometimes it's predictable and sometimes
it's<00:04:48.660> not<00:04:48.750> depending<00:04:49.199> on<00:04:49.320> who<00:04:49.470> you're<00:04:49.560> playing

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770

it's not depending on who you're playing
like<00:04:49.949> sometimes<00:04:50.490> I'm<00:04:50.669> not<00:04:50.699> that<00:04:51.060> predictable

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
like sometimes I'm not that predictable

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
playing on this game alone he doesn't

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.010 
playing on this game alone he doesn't
play<00:04:59.699> like<00:04:59.729> this<00:05:00.090> when<00:05:00.240> he's<00:05:00.360> playing<00:05:00.479> against
