 therefore, holiness on a train there 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.300
 we never stop 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.370
 let's not stop this video either 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.190
 so also this video to reach 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.989
 to overtake four way then 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.000
 left me like as a second thing there 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.920
 I wanted to say something with you well 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.870
 see this what the team with which 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.840
 we had stayed in the previous episode 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.969
 this because because he is wretched of 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.100
 delegate program had registered 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.040
 initially the episode all the clips of 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.500
 that episode is so out of nowhere there 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.510
 had indeed eliminated alone however 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.490
 as you can see I had in all the 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.619
 hours you play as you see historian 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.320
 without hard, even simple to say 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.570
 that one defeat did not arrive cause 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.960
 our thought we concluded the project 21 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.970
 crazy and so brilliant that says boulders 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.590
 if a person wins it at 1 it is logical to 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.700
 strolling players after the game 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.110
 so let's give away defeat are 6 0 1 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.390
 having said that I had also made some 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.240
 in fact, he managed to get me 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.280
 for the simple oc 84 then version a 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.840
 shouted that it looks a bit like a phenomenon 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.520
 from the statistics because a is looked at 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.110
 po these nerds player really 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.049
 complete or later if I'm not mistaken 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.340
 come maybe yes naldo highest paid 900 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.500
 and now to make another think of it always 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.710
 the turnover number we do this 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:00.759
 moment the moment the mar goods inspires me 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:03.159
 save diameter of rods 150 kg we find 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:06.939
 God ago they took the one without 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.769
 contract but I can be so stupid 18 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.959
 credits do not find the contract 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:12.760
 great those guys did one 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.069
 this much of coutinho our state 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.989
 do not do it here if you are 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.799
 following this team don't do as I do 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.290
 I made it 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:22.120
 very last thing before leaving if 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.650
 see I have a team shirt 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.930
 in this case paris saint germain 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.420
 because I had come to an idea I came 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.700
 in mind to use a 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.370
 a general club in each episode mi 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.680
 so we can have the t-shirts mentioned 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.180
 place if we can say and you can too 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.950
 with stern and others because in the end 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.049
 sometimes some complete me 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.940
 I therefore take it if you do n't like it 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.500
 competive to take like a shirt 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.349
 pretty nice of some team 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.810
 in the cults and we go to meet our 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:53.079
 today's first challenge but she is the chelsea 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.950
 it is obviously against a team 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.440
 of phenomena 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:00.310
 the goal is to take less than six god 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.450
 madonna no no attention and van persie but 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.519
 even the legs 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:08.319
 oh God what stopped me good good 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:12.639
 attention attention 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:14.799
 oh god track from tweets you have seen maybe 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:18.730
 it just needs to go straight it just has to go 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:20.919
 straight no ok i took the ball to the horse is 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.569
 a horse horse although it can 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:24.569
 always with star from us 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:36.709
 in advantage, listen to this guy 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:40.950
 home rai three who passes in the middle 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:44.909
 no he did n't whistle but he talks about kaiser 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.129
 I was wrong though maybe it's if we carry 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:51.750
 on the 2 0 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:54.209
 Thirtieth year from a very good a 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.819
 on paper cm I keep this stage playing 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:04:00.299
 a phenomenon is phenomenon is offside 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:03.510
 well then the creation if still one 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:06.930
 scrap give me mario santo puts in 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:09.480
 break the sale and tweeted man like that 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.919
 the real won 2 to 0 we needed this 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.780
 win because our test the 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:14.700
 very strong team did not receive 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.549
 but all the credits because in fact less 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:20.009
 only 329 we need two contracts because 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.889
 the channel will be determined then 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:24.830
 we take a gold contract brought them 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:28.470
 among giant future credits 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:30.750
 then alas use to use caliber 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.330
 think well of this match then 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.889
 sheen understanding that we have arrived yet 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.039
 69 jobs 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:41.099
 then let's give it this really 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:41.970
 important because if we succeed in 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:43.770
 to win 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.409
 we will be able to do certain 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:49.080
 purchases and improve the understanding of 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:51.300
 team but we find one in attack a 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:56.370
 sturridge which is a phenomenon on this 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:57.180
 play with rock over time 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.139
 gold 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:05.430
 I come from bull taurus bull my enemy but 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:08.750
 desire for a guide eriksen faith bright 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:13.169
 white bright white bright light my fire 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:15.190
 he had to be a woman with the numerino, praying to him 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:20.280
 even around the 20th 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:23.410
 they took the advantage of a very good one 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.980
 very good very good Madonna 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.890
 phenomenon 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:29.440
 no no guys what about rai due 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:32.170
 the jersey is the thirty-second one 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.690
 good luck of them so we say that 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:39.130
 there is but I do not know if you are interested but 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:43.570
 lucas lucas is also Luhr equity 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:46.810
 this maran and even not what he does 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:49.900
 all he, however, the shadow he wants to mark 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.520
 the ball closet is amazing and then it does 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.680
 goals 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:56.020
 the Italian committed suicide provided or not 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:59.110
 it is worth doing everything he wants to do everything himself 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.640
 no, however, to the kind also and to the kind 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.450
 that passes maybe because maybe even 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.720
 wants to score goals 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:06.910
 what we are really annihilating is 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.620
 the fact that the Italian and from today 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.960
 I could also for another game three 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:13.720
 start with the disgust of areas they want 5 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:16.330
 thousand I like it here I want 5000 m all 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:19.780
 come in that balls even now don't 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:22.990
 we have so many credits just look at the 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:25.960
 guys this is the team i know has me 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.640
 still little understood but where we star 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.890
 faithful you must have faith 

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:32.230
 we are calm we only need credits 

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:34.050
 they just don't always need more 

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:36.820
 late opponent must finish a game 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:40.510
 The latest children studied today are not 

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:43.600
 to 100 of understanding therefore first adversary 

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:45.370
 with which they point the student but 

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.410
 a very strange team because it uses 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:50.560
 11 as a left-back 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:52.360
 I believe how I feel campista bismarck 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.690
 a right wing 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.200
 better for us it is better for us 

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:58.090
 beautiful beautiful beautiful 

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:01.270
 maybe in regular me you make it a goal 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:02.820
 if it does and does so it is closed with one a 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:05.770
 zero 

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:10.120
 oh my God it is Italian and from the launch for 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:12.870
 result and I want June I want 

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:18.610
 hear him swear 

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:21.210
 no each 91 equity and purchased too 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:24.430
 we can't finish the game 

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:26.949
 guys okay 9 points positions are 

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:29.110
 anyway guys guys said that the 

00:07:26.949 --> 00:07:31.300
 video is finished i hope you enjoyed it 

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:33.310
 obviously I recommend left one 

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.840
 if I wanted to remind you of 

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:36.610
 comment as always that a comment 

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.919
 always a pleasure but if you want to 

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:40.240
 also advise in a shirt 

00:07:38.919 --> 00:07:42.190
 obviously soccer shirt of one 

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.139
 team that you want, maybe not 

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:45.940
 the future will not take it anyway I hope to 

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:47.590
 tarsia the idea precisely to use one 

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:49.150
 different excuse the repeating words 

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:51.280
 t-shirt for each episode 

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:54.900
 having said this I greet you and cotton 

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:54.900
 silk based on the next chosen video
