00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.250
 the corinthians takes seriously the apocryphal testament in action 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.249
 And then a question that I'm going to pack into her here. 

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:14.359
 what if the parts thing to because it is part of a bunch of apocalyptic it 

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:15.159
 is 

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:18.159
 Look, I've never met a little hurricane. 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:22.519
 in the liturgy you have read all the airports in none that I have 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:25.880
 dear good to me 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.010
 all of them 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.690
 we are in the right place 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.839
 out of the dispute tell you do you think the heartbreak now takes advantage of the letter 

00:00:32.839 --> 00:00:37.399
 if I think the apostrophe is not in the bible because it is bored he is not 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.079
 there is no propagation of selectivity should avoid this not to see a 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.099
 protest of selectivity by having punctured 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.280
 He understands if I were alone to get him to 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.510
 which ended up forming ninth in Nepal a Protestant Reformation 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.900
 still take away the apocryphal books which the Catholics represented 7 thousand 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.940
 jews the door 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.720
 eternal fight with politics 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.340
 which does not have in protest the already Protestant almost 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.580
 danced apocalypse tiago tel 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.980
 Luther 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.370
 the water jadlog had nothing teaches him that the apocalypse he understands the 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.640
 truth out 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.730
 narrowly changed 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:21.860
 now here 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.710
 waste that s 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.430
 if I still had all the books 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.009
 which 7066 current and most apocryphal forgot about pop 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.760
 it's up to him 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.330
 as the largest leader 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.630
 I like a lot 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.450
 I would not run any of the same language bible 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.040
 in the afternoon and then kill yourself 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.190
 but let's make a suit complain 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.210
 the certificate for the crises gives up or moments after beating 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.630
 keep telling her it will be here 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.290
 thessalonians people paulo 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.470
 Timothy explained Paul 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.590
 has too much rubble army denied ordination of elders and deacons 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.820
 a later period of the second set will be created 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.100
 the princess peach 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.089
 license 

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:11.029
 I do not want to argue with him when they want 

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:15.290
 with all the wisdom with all the arguments of overthrowing any forum 

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:18.929
 and I want them to prove otherwise 

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:23.499
 why is it that they never accept this challenge 2009 my whole life I am 

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:24.399
 making 

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:26.429
 I've been a lifetime 

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:29.319
 speak in these places of oil 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.799
 I owe everything I think I will not have a structure to contradict 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:36.909
 he only discussed the last time he spoke of several 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:42.589
 you find a catheter worse than you are not afraid and that comes with 

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:43.909
 an ammunition 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:46.339
 of intellectual bombings 

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:51.769
 they throw a branch the coach also affected which declares amy argumentation 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.959
 the clash 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.370
 That's why God made my hand to say these things. 

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:02.640
 It's India 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.749
 even the question is this my testament basantha monk 

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:07.689
 she said 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:10.689
 I do not know anything about this nobody is missing anything 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:16.120
 who has the bible will not lose anything who has jesus do not need or know 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.699
 What the Bible Study Company 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:20.819
 is urgent 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.509
 and I do not give up on these people every year 

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:27.569
 is not essential is very important but it is not essential 

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:30.480
 after some that target 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.469
 the bear is such a thing 

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:34.359
 the Gospel 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:38.019
 who has the gospel time who do not have the gene can have the old testament 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.629
 internal opinion 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:42.419
 the card of a nun 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:47.230
 mateus forward he does not play for anything in the world in which after the world that 

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:50.229
 there's nothing obsolescent 

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:55.039
 except those concessions in the letters of paulo that he himself says the Chinese people 

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:57.809
 when of culture and customs 

00:03:57.809 --> 00:04:00.629
 general plan explained 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:02.539
 but the principle 

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:04.879
 unalterable 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:07.889
 and woe to him who wants to play 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:09.829
 in this item change 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:12.039
 in what is put 

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:16.139
 about what jesus said heaven and earth passed by but my words
