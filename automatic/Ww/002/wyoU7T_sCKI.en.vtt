over I'll get started again ok so now
for<00:03:13.690> my<00:03:13.989> next<00:03:14.590> step<00:03:14.829> I<00:03:15.099> am<00:03:15.220> going<00:03:15.549> to<00:03:16.389> cut<00:03:16.750> the

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
for my next step I am going to cut the

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.629 
for my next step I am going to cut the
foam<00:03:17.200> in<00:03:17.410> half<00:03:18.870> so<00:03:19.870> right<00:03:20.739> here<00:03:21.040> it<00:03:21.250> is<00:03:21.280> now

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
foam in half so right here it is now

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:26.370 
foam in half so right here it is now
forty<00:03:22.150> seven<00:03:22.510> and<00:03:22.720> a<00:03:22.810> half<00:03:22.859> inches<00:03:25.350> so<00:03:26.350> that

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
forty seven and a half inches so that

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:34.110 
forty seven and a half inches so that

foil<00:04:03.579> part<00:04:04.060> of<00:04:04.209> it<00:04:04.359> because<00:04:05.019> I<00:04:05.049> don't<00:04:05.260> need<00:04:05.709> to

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:05.889 
foil part of it because I don't need to

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:07.140 
foil part of it because I don't need to
cut<00:04:06.099> through<00:04:06.280> all<00:04:06.430> of<00:04:06.489> it<00:04:06.700> and<00:04:06.849> I'll<00:04:06.970> show<00:04:07.120> you

why okay so I have now cut directly

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.740 
why okay so I have now cut directly
through<00:04:13.389> it<00:04:13.540> and<00:04:13.889> so<00:04:14.889> I<00:04:15.190> am<00:04:15.459> going<00:04:15.819> to<00:04:16.180> fold<00:04:16.539> it

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
through it and so I am going to fold it

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.020 
through it and so I am going to fold it
