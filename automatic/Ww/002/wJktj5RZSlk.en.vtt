00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:08.269
 what's up with people zero tv with one 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.960
 new video to destiny and indeed patch 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:11.849
 1.1.1 is online 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.710
 we'll explain something to you 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.509
 let's start, let's start 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.400
 We already knew that since 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.930
 Last weeks that is an update 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.750
 is and was also clearly discussed 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.369
 that the heavy ammunition be fixed 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.099
 should have done that here too 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.570
 because if now like sport or 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.090
 be revived then you have 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.399
 the same number of ammunition continues 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.710
 her before also also became one 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.540
 further back gefixed in the inventory if 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.700
 for example, the whole inventory 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.800
 with syntheses full had liable this 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.840
 then want to use then the 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.770
 Although you counted you had the cool down of 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.780
 five minutes 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.300
 but this thesis was not rated 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.510
 and your ammo was still at 0 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.719
 that was also fixed on the ps3 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.899
 as well as xbox 360 it was probably that in 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.969
 the demoversion of destiny probably wrong 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.920
 the damage has been in it 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.979
 were now also adapted to the 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.680
 momentarily maximum damage he then 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.000
 was the ability to shoot to loot should 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.680
 We know some of you 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.869
 reported several times when you on 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.000
 ammunition shoots that you then with it 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.100
 This ability could be collected 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.140
 Also gefixed is probably happened several times 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.000
 that when people are on the ammo too 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.909
 you have shot quickly then you 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.280
 several times over a munitions depot several 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.869
 can take ammunition packages that wants 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.500
 Of course you are not a package 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.360
 a package 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.400
 and accordingly you have there now 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.390
 a cooldown of about two 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.970
 seconds 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.250
 then the matchmaking system was in 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.409
 heroic strike with the built-in 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.820
 means if you go now on mÃ¼nster 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.829
 maximum 9 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.630
 then it is not possible for her anymore 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.180
 the whole solo does it if you do that 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.729
 whole solo starts immediately 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.399
 two more players added her 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.100
 knows that already from pvp and the 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.689
 strike playlists and also there were 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.610
 Changes have been made 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.159
 reported is now a better 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.500
 rotation is possible that is if you 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.040
 strike then you should not play six 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.380
 or seven times in a row 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.080
 same map we get now to 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.630
 pvp mode and that if you have the 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.730
 are crucibles has unlocked 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.120
 also all playlist so control 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.130
 conflict rumble and fight free for 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.260
 everyone was then too 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.090
 melting pot improves the rotation 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.490
 it was there too that one then 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.020
 really permanent on the same map 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.450
 landed and I have to be very clear 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.980
 when the new dlc came out there 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.050
 It took only times really long 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.600
 until I even play the new maps 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.850
 could also be very interesting here 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.890
 if you match in the melting pot now 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.350
 an enemy is the heavy ammunition 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.050
 for example, for the rocket launcher 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.180
 wears herself and her child then gets 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.820
 her not his heavy ammo 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.380
 which was completely taken out the 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.780
 If you get the kilt then you get 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.510
 nothing was then synonymous with the green 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.850
 So special ammunition also a bit 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.280
 what changed and that will be a lot 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.220
 be less if an opponent they drop 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.500
 but that was the end of the 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.870
 Melting pot improved you can now 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.580
 as high level no longer low level 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.920
 Armor parts get in the 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.230
 By the way, Eisenbahner became the rotation 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.090
 strong of the maps in the playlists 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.370
 improved because there are now too 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.230
 we come to several small maps now 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.630
 our favorite black market dealer 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.150
 and that was the good for the was 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.000
 he also fixed in the last one 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:34.390
 only the exotic gramme from and weeks 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.700
 to it from now on should be constant so each 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.690
 week exotic gramme on it 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.730
 maybe we are lucky too 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.549
 These theses are often with at the start 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.140
 his was then at the end of the war a back 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.940
 fixed when you have this green 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.920
 But he should not get a banner 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.410
 This was mostly due to it 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.510
 that the inventory has been full and 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.830
 The banner never became a postmaster 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.360
 I sent him early 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.830
 that's why not get it during 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.739
 everyone with this fucking green banner 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:02.049
 at dc the fire is this banner 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.360
 is now in this respect the inventory bus 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:07.420
 Full is sent to the postmaster 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.730
 there is another change now 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.620
 visible in the inventory and although you can 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.659
 you mobilize there the call of the fractions 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.630
 in or how high you there m 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:20.299
 Wrote since very nice in a total 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.550
 statistic evident we now come to 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.930
 the weapons and indeed are some 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.940
 improved weapons and some 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.560
 for example, the deteriorated 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:32.570
 pumpgun was 100 percent in pvp 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.639
 improved in pvp she stays like her 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.669
 because for some is the pumpgun anyway 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:39.860
 in the pvp already too much power then 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:42.020
 impulse guns were more in the game 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.720
 integrated by doing this at ten 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.510
 percent has improved handguns 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.610
 were a bit deteriorated and 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.139
 automatic payment about three percent 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.270
 hurt on a deteriorated for one 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.770
 Complete list of weapons change 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.600
 look in the description there 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.669
 you can go directly to the bungie page 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.710
 go and then see what exactly was going on 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:02.060
 which weapons we can change 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.070
 ever say that the horn horn 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.289
 as well as other rocket launcher not 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.120
 we have now been touched 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:10.580
 all something and beautiful theme and indeed 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.199
 the change folk last many wanted 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.060
 that with an update this weapon 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:14.930
 is improved and in the modern age 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.240
 is brought 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.400
 but now it happened 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.789
 The weapon has been worsened 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:25.610
 because she was stolen ammunition in the pvp 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:27.860
 that was probably because you fusion 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.990
 wanted to change rifles in general and 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.450
 then the six fell cast 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.849
 as a primary one was for under knife 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:36.349
 but definitely not wanted 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:39.680
 because bungie has already commented on that 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:41.930
 this should be raised in the future 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.389
 when that will come but you know 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.620
 At this moment we do not hope 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:47.330
 In any case, that's fast happening 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.340
 because many like to play with the 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.110
 In addition, it may be growing 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.510
 happy that the gri moore cards 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.849
 have been improved and that is 20 pieces 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.320
 there were probably some bugs that the well 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:59.449
 they are not often flopped and they are 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.160
 that's why it did not get that 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:02.750
 now fixed and here again one 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.729
 very clear announcement people if you the 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.740
 You want to see details about which bodies 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:08.270
 which have improved 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.310
 Weapon types worsened or 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.380
 have been improved check the 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.330
 original patch note from bungie point 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.310
 net link in the description then would 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.169
 I say, people are out as well 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.940
 we have now discussed everything 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:22.750
 which was really important for you 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:26.020
 so please have your opinion on the 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:27.730
 a patch 1.1.1 in the comments what 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.620
 you could have saved yourself what is 

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:31.480
 really good and what is still 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.310
 We were not made any more 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.770
 but like a thumbs up there as we 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:37.300
 always try to be very informative 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.370
 to be and we hope that too 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.020
 That's why it's a thumbs-up 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.640
