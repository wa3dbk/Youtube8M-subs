00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:12.320
 talk to you and sasaki as well, let's get questions about 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.009
 consumer 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.630
 ana karine is a Sofia, alright, alright, Ana. 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.720
 my husband made a purchase of a cell phone on a foreign site 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.589
 through credit card black dress 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:26.929
 could go to the island 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:28.900
 about five thousand 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.470
 never received the product 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.170
 we contacted the press that soon canceled the purchase and in the 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.330
 informed that we should contact the company that made the delivery 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.370
 Here in Brazil 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.320
 they did it 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.590
 only that we were told that the reason for not receiving the product 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.470
 is that he had been kidnapped and to pain 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.940
 we would like to know what measures should be taken 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.300
 and if we have the right to sue or 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.040
 the company for the lack of commitment in the delivery of the purchase or if we 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.410
 sue whoever ought to go to justice if it's my cousin's husband 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.410
 Anyway, what do I do sophia? 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.230
 look ana karine the situation would be complicated know why 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.350
 by the following 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.490
 the prosecutor of the public ministry of Acre de Carmo Lira da Silva 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.340
 said that six commit the mother 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.510
 is the following when the company when you make the purchase through a 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.030
 foreign company 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.940
 and the agreement is not fulfilled 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.790
 does not exist here in brazil means to force uncertainty 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.910
 to comply with the agreement she is not a company in the country 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.320
 you can not do this 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.670
 you would have to file a lawsuit in the country of origin 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.480
 Look how this situation is now. 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.359
 Now yes 

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:58.460
 the presence of the geira she has 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.910
 a branch here in Brazil, the thing changes a little bit of the right figure 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.710
 now there's something else too 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.219
 you tell him that you have a company that lost product 

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:11.929
 if you can prove 

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:17.409
 if this foreign company can prove it demonstrates that it delivered the product 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:19.209
 in perfect condition 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.209
 It seems that I should have delivered here in Brazil. 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.379
 you can sue in thorn 

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:30.839
 It costs that the producer 

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:31.839
 right 

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:33.269
 now 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.659
 and it's going to have to be going pretty complicated 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:39.889
 when you buy from foreign company 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:42.889
 nothing even had done in the international scene space 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:48.409
 the national press sent the product to the company that delivered the product was 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:49.769
 with drought problems 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.799
 was not hypothetical because consumer protection requires that 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.009
 in this case joint and several liability 

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:58.660
 both you process one as the other 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.909
 they have to go there, they have to know who they are going to be like 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:05.369
 the product that the consumer or the consumer has nothing to do with it 

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:08.809
 in the case of foreign companies pass is very difficult 

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:13.499
 because you do not have to do it in mine you have to innovate in the country 

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:14.999
 fight with angola 

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:17.339
 a fake page in the white house 

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:18.869
 now 

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:21.899
 when she uses more unhurried you decide 

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:23.660
 and had to close river 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.599
 Can you prove it? 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:29.619
 you have a chance there and to get jobs you need to be compensated 

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:33.609
 however the driver and tell says the following look only 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:36.269
 that's important attention 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.959
 the company that received the product 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:40.680
 No, you do not. 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.939
 nothing apifarma for you 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:46.410
 why was not the six cube she hired 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.809
 went there with the foreign press 

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:51.170
 that's one more problem 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.959
 one more difficulty 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.669
 another publication is the foreign press that will have to give 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:57.439
 you 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:00.209
 states is not like any good will 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.519
 so you can 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:03.719
 to have access 

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:08.950
 art these data there that she delivered there very good touch and your product right 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.609
 and it was there that we saw 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:12.539
 look Ana Karine 

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:15.379
 really the situation 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:21.109
 although the river and promises a lot of headache so it is that the consumer has 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.330
 stay tuned 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.569
 do not tell me he's going to buy there 

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:31.550
 Mayan elf can not buy from companies can generate logical 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.439
 the demand and if it does not have a branch in that country 

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:37.349
 When you have a daughter, but the country is easier. 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:42.830
 then justice understands that you have the right to sue at last for 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.439
 here inside the country 

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:48.479
 It's quite tricky even if you look 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.419
 purchased in its products only companies 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:54.080
 if the period had been made 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.420
 that's it if you have more doubts about everything that messes with your pocket 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:01.710
 ask me what I was for your daughter 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.710
 I hope to get a good answer for you.
