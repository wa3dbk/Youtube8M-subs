00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
it which is behind the scenes so to

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.860 
it which is behind the scenes so to
start<00:00:45.460> with<00:00:45.610> let's<00:00:45.910> just<00:00:46.150> make<00:00:46.330> the<00:00:46.510> visual

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
start with let's just make the visual

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.310 
start with let's just make the visual
appearance<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:48.250> the<00:00:48.610> watermark<00:00:49.120> now<00:00:49.390> before<00:00:50.290> I

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
appearance of the watermark now before I

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.140 
appearance of the watermark now before I
start<00:00:50.500> just<00:00:51.010> to<00:00:51.130> let<00:00:51.250> you<00:00:51.370> know<00:00:51.400> that<00:00:51.550> from

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
start just to let you know that from

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.040 
start just to let you know that from
this<00:00:52.360> video<00:00:52.600> there's<00:00:52.750> going<00:00:52.780> to<00:00:52.900> be<00:00:52.990> a

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
this video there's going to be a

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.990 
this video there's going to be a
subsequent<00:00:53.470> video<00:00:53.710> about<00:00:54.130> how<00:00:54.430> you<00:00:54.490> would<00:00:54.820> do

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
subsequent video about how you would do

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.050 
subsequent video about how you would do
batching<00:00:55.660> of<00:00:55.780> watermarks<00:00:56.470> ie<00:00:57.010> if<00:00:57.520> you've<00:00:57.820> got

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.060 
batching of watermarks ie if you've got

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.150 
batching of watermarks ie if you've got
50<00:00:58.360> images<00:00:58.989> that<00:00:59.140> you<00:00:59.230> want<00:00:59.320> a<00:00:59.410> watermark<00:00:59.980> in

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
50 images that you want a watermark in

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.740 
50 images that you want a watermark in
quick<00:01:00.370> succession<00:01:00.550> I'll<00:01:01.180> be<00:01:01.300> showing<00:01:01.510> you

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
quick succession I'll be showing you

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.300 
quick succession I'll be showing you
that<00:01:01.870> it's<00:01:02.050> a<00:01:02.170> separate<00:01:02.560> video<00:01:02.739> because

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:03.310 
that it's a separate video because

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.850 
that it's a separate video because
that's<00:01:03.579> known<00:01:03.820> as<00:01:04.049> batching<00:01:05.049> and<00:01:05.199> we'll<00:01:05.500> get

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
that's known as batching and we'll get

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:06.630 
that's known as batching and we'll get
to<00:01:05.979> that<00:01:06.100> shortly

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
to that shortly

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.039 
to that shortly
but<00:01:06.939> let's<00:01:07.090> just<00:01:07.210> deal<00:01:07.390> with<00:01:07.420> the<00:01:07.600> basics

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
but let's just deal with the basics

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:09.899 
but let's just deal with the basics
first<00:01:08.290> let's<00:01:08.530> just<00:01:08.710> get<00:01:08.920> a<00:01:08.950> watermark<00:01:09.490> onto

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
first let's just get a watermark onto

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.120 
first let's just get a watermark onto
our<00:01:10.090> image<00:01:10.390> now<00:01:10.990> this<00:01:11.200> will<00:01:11.380> require<00:01:11.860> at<00:01:12.100> least

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
our image now this will require at least

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.149 
our image now this will require at least
probably<00:01:13.060> one<00:01:13.330> new<00:01:13.840> layer<00:01:14.229> I<00:01:14.620> would<00:01:14.920> probably

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
probably one new layer I would probably

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.280 
probably one new layer I would probably
recommend<00:01:15.460> you<00:01:15.880> one<00:01:16.120> too<00:01:16.450> so<00:01:17.020> what<00:01:17.110> I'm<00:01:17.170> going

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
recommend you one too so what I'm going

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:18.510 
recommend you one too so what I'm going
to<00:01:17.350> do<00:01:17.500> is<00:01:17.620> off<00:01:17.740> to<00:01:17.830> the<00:01:17.920> side<00:01:18.100> here<00:01:18.130> I'm<00:01:18.430> going

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
to do is off to the side here I'm going

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.890 
to do is off to the side here I'm going
to<00:01:18.610> just<00:01:18.729> create<00:01:19.210> a<00:01:19.240> new<00:01:20.020> layer<00:01:20.049> straightaway

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
to just create a new layer straightaway

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.969 
to just create a new layer straightaway
I'm<00:01:22.900> not<00:01:23.110> going<00:01:23.229> to<00:01:23.290> be<00:01:23.380> bothered<00:01:23.650> about<00:01:23.740> the

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
I'm not going to be bothered about the

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.149 
I'm not going to be bothered about the
names<00:01:24.190> here<00:01:24.460> because<00:01:24.790> for<00:01:25.150> batching<00:01:25.950> it's<00:01:26.950> not

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
names here because for batching it's not

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:28.410 
names here because for batching it's not
going<00:01:27.250> to<00:01:27.340> be<00:01:27.430> important<00:01:27.940> for<00:01:28.030> this

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
going to be important for this

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.539 
going to be important for this
particular<00:01:28.780> example<00:01:29.470> so<00:01:29.500> first<00:01:30.340> thing<00:01:30.460> we

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
particular example so first thing we

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:31.770 
particular example so first thing we
need<00:01:30.670> to<00:01:30.700> do<00:01:30.880> is<00:01:31.000> we<00:01:31.120> need<00:01:31.210> to<00:01:31.360> get<00:01:31.600> like<00:01:31.720> a

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
need to do is we need to get like a

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.320 
need to do is we need to get like a
copyright<00:01:32.320> symbol<00:01:32.770> now<00:01:32.920> you<00:01:33.400> can<00:01:33.700> use<00:01:33.970> the<00:01:34.150> Alt

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
copyright symbol now you can use the Alt

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.350 
copyright symbol now you can use the Alt
key<00:01:34.420> and<00:01:34.690> type<00:01:34.930> in<00:01:35.200> the<00:01:35.320> magic<00:01:35.729> number<00:01:36.729> to<00:01:36.760> get

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
key and type in the magic number to get

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.240 
key and type in the magic number to get
up<00:01:37.570> and<00:01:37.869> the<00:01:38.200> copyright<00:01:38.590> symbol<00:01:38.799> or

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
up and the copyright symbol or

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.600 
up and the copyright symbol or
alternatively<00:01:40.000> on<00:01:40.299> your<00:01:41.080> toolbar<00:01:41.610> where

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
alternatively on your toolbar where

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.190 
alternatively on your toolbar where
you've<00:01:42.850> got<00:01:43.090> options<00:01:43.240> like<00:01:43.750> to<00:01:43.930> draw<00:01:44.170> a

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
you've got options like to draw a

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.250 
you've got options like to draw a
rectangle<00:01:44.979> tool<00:01:45.330> circle<00:01:46.330> and<00:01:46.570> so<00:01:46.750> on<00:01:46.869> you'll

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
rectangle tool circle and so on you'll

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.020 
rectangle tool circle and so on you'll

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
have a custom shape tool so I'm going to

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.020 
have a custom shape tool so I'm going to
select<00:01:49.240> that<00:01:49.360> and<00:01:50.070> at<00:01:51.070> the<00:01:51.310> top<00:01:51.580> on<00:01:51.939> the

that<00:02:02.740> I<00:02:02.950> just<00:02:03.009> draw<00:02:03.610> with<00:02:03.820> the<00:02:03.909> mouse<00:02:04.090> on<00:02:04.360> the

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
that I just draw with the mouse on the

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.219 
that I just draw with the mouse on the
screen<00:02:06.180> holding<00:02:07.180> down<00:02:07.270> the<00:02:07.390> shift<00:02:07.600> key<00:02:07.659> just

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
screen holding down the shift key just

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.779 
screen holding down the shift key just
to<00:02:08.319> keep<00:02:08.470> it<00:02:08.649> in<00:02:08.739> proportion<00:02:08.799> a<00:02:09.310> copyright

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
to keep it in proportion a copyright

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.259 
to keep it in proportion a copyright
symbol<00:02:10.149> so<00:02:11.110> I<00:02:11.140> wanted<00:02:11.439> to<00:02:11.560> make<00:02:11.680> it<00:02:11.799> that<00:02:11.980> big

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
symbol so I wanted to make it that big

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:15.000 
symbol so I wanted to make it that big
okay<00:02:13.269> looks<00:02:13.629> absolutely<00:02:14.049> horrible<00:02:14.529> not

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
okay looks absolutely horrible not

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.470 
okay looks absolutely horrible not
bothered<00:02:15.370> at<00:02:15.459> this<00:02:15.609> stage<00:02:15.849> what<00:02:16.150> we're<00:02:16.299> going

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
bothered at this stage what we're going

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.420 
bothered at this stage what we're going
to<00:02:16.540> do<00:02:16.749> though<00:02:16.959> now<00:02:17.200> is<00:02:17.409> we're<00:02:17.590> going<00:02:17.709> to

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
to do though now is we're going to

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.490 
to do though now is we're going to
tidy<00:02:18.640> up<00:02:18.760> and<00:02:19.060> make<00:02:19.209> it<00:02:19.239> watermark<00:02:20.200> so<00:02:20.349> it's

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
tidy up and make it watermark so it's

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.130 
tidy up and make it watermark so it's
transparent<00:02:21.010> so<00:02:21.939> what<00:02:22.150> we<00:02:22.239> do<00:02:22.420> now<00:02:22.629> is<00:02:22.840> with

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
transparent so what we do now is with

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.170 
transparent so what we do now is with
that<00:02:23.319> particular<00:02:23.799> layer<00:02:24.159> selected<00:02:24.730> we<00:02:24.969> go<00:02:25.120> to

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
that particular layer selected we go to

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.360 
that particular layer selected we go to
filter<00:02:26.019> and<00:02:26.760> I<00:02:27.760> think<00:02:28.200> stylize<00:02:29.200> yes<00:02:29.859> stylize

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
filter and I think stylize yes stylize

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.539 
filter and I think stylize yes stylize
and<00:02:30.579> emboss<00:02:31.209> and<00:02:31.920> it<00:02:32.920> will<00:02:33.069> then<00:02:33.189> just<00:02:33.400> say

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
and emboss and it will then just say

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.069 
and emboss and it will then just say
well<00:02:33.819> I've<00:02:33.969> got<00:02:34.000> to<00:02:34.180> rasterize<00:02:34.540> it<00:02:34.930> which

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079 
well I've got to rasterize it which

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:36.330 
well I've got to rasterize it which
we've<00:02:35.200> talked<00:02:35.409> about<00:02:35.530> before<00:02:35.739> which<00:02:36.129> means

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
we've talked about before which means

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.160 
we've talked about before which means
it's<00:02:36.609> changing<00:02:37.030> it<00:02:37.150> from<00:02:37.329> a<00:02:37.569> vector<00:02:37.900> graphic

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
it's changing it from a vector graphic

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.440 
it's changing it from a vector graphic
which<00:02:38.769> is<00:02:38.920> just<00:02:39.189> lots<00:02:39.370> of<00:02:39.549> computational

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
which is just lots of computational

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.929 
which is just lots of computational
numbers<00:02:40.840> to<00:02:41.049> make<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.349> circle<00:02:41.769> through<00:02:42.400> to<00:02:42.700> an

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:42.939 
numbers to make the circle through to an

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:46.140 
numbers to make the circle through to an
actual<00:02:43.329> pixel<00:02:43.930> based<00:02:44.409> image<00:02:45.069> and<00:02:45.760> lo<00:02:46.000> and

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
actual pixel based image and lo and

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.729 
actual pixel based image and lo and
behold<00:02:46.209> there<00:02:46.629> we<00:02:46.720> are<00:02:46.750> we<00:02:47.019> can<00:02:47.200> see<00:02:47.379> it's<00:02:47.530> done

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
behold there we are we can see it's done

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.280 
behold there we are we can see it's done
this<00:02:47.859> embossed<00:02:48.310> section<00:02:49.000> here<00:02:49.269> I'm<00:02:49.719> not<00:02:50.139> going

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
this embossed section here I'm not going

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.690 
this embossed section here I'm not going
to<00:02:50.379> be<00:02:50.439> too<00:02:50.620> fussy<00:02:50.859> about<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.250> height<00:02:51.549> and

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
to be too fussy about the height and

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.009 
to be too fussy about the height and
width<00:02:51.849> you<00:02:52.060> can<00:02:52.090> play<00:02:52.389> around<00:02:52.510> with<00:02:52.720> that<00:02:52.810> to

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
width you can play around with that to

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.420 
width you can play around with that to
your<00:02:53.139> heart's<00:02:53.379> content<00:02:53.500> I'm<00:02:54.099> just<00:02:54.250> going<00:02:54.370> to

around<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.579> screen<00:03:00.849> a<00:03:00.879> little<00:03:01.090> bit<00:03:01.359> let's<00:03:01.780> get

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
around the screen a little bit let's get

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.960 
around the screen a little bit let's get
it<00:03:02.049> on<00:03:02.200> to<00:03:02.470> some<00:03:02.739> of<00:03:02.829> the<00:03:02.889> greenery<00:03:03.280> you'll<00:03:03.760> see

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:12.129 
the layer option from being normal which

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:14.460 
the layer option from being normal which
is<00:03:12.159> just<00:03:12.519> going<00:03:12.730> to<00:03:12.849> superimpose<00:03:13.329> on<00:03:13.720> top<00:03:13.930> we

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
is just going to superimpose on top we

because the other side of the story is
we<00:04:33.290> need<00:04:33.530> to<00:04:33.650> actually<00:04:34.040> put<00:04:34.220> in<00:04:34.400> all<00:04:34.760> of<00:04:34.820> our
