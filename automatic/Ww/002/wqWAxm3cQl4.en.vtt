that won't work somebody got Laura's
Urkel<00:03:20.750> gift<00:03:20.959> of<00:03:21.110> that<00:03:21.340> lateral<00:03:22.340> wall<00:03:23.440> I've<00:03:24.440> got

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
Urkel gift of that lateral wall I've got

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:25.869 
Urkel gift of that lateral wall I've got
I<00:03:24.680> have<00:03:24.920> enough<00:03:25.160> of<00:03:25.250> this<00:03:25.370> off<00:03:25.550> here's<00:03:25.760> what

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 
I have enough of this off here's what

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:27.670 
I have enough of this off here's what
happens<00:03:26.209> you<00:03:26.510> go<00:03:27.080> through<00:03:27.260> the<00:03:27.349> center<00:03:27.590> of

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
happens you go through the center of

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.460 
happens you go through the center of
this<00:03:27.769> foot<00:03:28.010> I<00:03:28.989> want<00:03:29.989> to<00:03:30.049> leave<00:03:30.170> a<00:03:30.200> little<00:03:30.379> bit

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
this foot I want to leave a little bit

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.619 
this foot I want to leave a little bit
high<00:03:30.739> on<00:03:30.769> the<00:03:31.069> inside<00:03:31.670> so<00:03:32.180> that<00:03:32.209> he<00:03:32.450> can<00:03:32.569> go

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:32.629 
high on the inside so that he can go

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.900 
high on the inside so that he can go
from<00:03:32.780> here<00:03:33.080> to<00:03:33.410> there<00:03:33.530> okay<00:03:33.950> so<00:03:34.040> he<00:03:34.190> can<00:03:34.310> even

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
from here to there okay so he can even

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.240 
from here to there okay so he can even
basically<00:03:35.870> bring<00:03:36.410> the<00:03:36.560> lateral<00:03:36.860> side<00:03:37.040> down

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
basically bring the lateral side down

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.809 
basically bring the lateral side down
but<00:03:38.209> if<00:03:38.330> this<00:03:38.480> goes<00:03:38.750> back<00:03:39.049> this<00:03:39.709> grows<00:03:40.010> twisted

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
but if this goes back this grows twisted

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:42.789 
but if this goes back this grows twisted
so<00:03:41.450> it's<00:03:41.630> past<00:03:41.840> the<00:03:42.049> centerline<00:03:42.500> of<00:03:42.530> that

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
so it's past the centerline of that

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.039 
so it's past the centerline of that
coffin<00:03:43.069> joint<00:03:43.370> then<00:03:44.239> it<00:03:44.390> becomes<00:03:44.630> a<00:03:44.750> pivot

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
coffin joint then it becomes a pivot

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:47.110 
coffin joint then it becomes a pivot
point<00:03:45.290> and<00:03:45.650> he<00:03:45.860> actually<00:03:46.130> uses<00:03:46.340> that<00:03:46.610> edge<00:03:46.880> to

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
point and he actually uses that edge to

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.330 
point and he actually uses that edge to
pivot<00:03:47.299> over<00:03:47.540> so<00:03:48.319> there's<00:03:48.470> a<00:03:48.560> fine<00:03:48.799> line<00:03:49.099> in

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
pivot over so there's a fine line in

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.600 
pivot over so there's a fine line in
there<00:03:49.489> between<00:03:50.060> what<00:03:50.390> you<00:03:50.569> want<00:03:50.900> and<00:03:51.519> what<00:03:52.519> you

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
there between what you want and what you

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.819 
there between what you want and what you
can<00:03:52.819> have<00:03:53.079> so<00:03:54.079> I'm<00:03:54.200> going<00:03:54.349> to<00:03:54.379> go<00:03:54.530> ahead<00:03:54.739> and

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
can have so I'm going to go ahead and

00:03:54.829 --> 00:04:04.020 
can have so I'm going to go ahead and
take<00:03:54.980> this<00:03:55.129> down<00:03:55.190> a<00:03:55.370> little<00:03:55.489> further<00:03:55.790> here

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:17.199 

into<00:04:05.030> the<00:04:13.989> pivots<00:04:14.989> on<00:04:15.139> every<00:04:15.470> step<00:04:15.859> yeah<00:04:16.209> there

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
into the pivots on every step yeah there

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.229 
into the pivots on every step yeah there
you<00:04:17.329> go<00:04:17.389> yes<00:04:17.780> yeah<00:04:18.049> any<00:04:18.590> more<00:04:18.979> weight<00:04:19.190> on<00:04:19.220> it<00:04:19.519> he

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
you go yes yeah any more weight on it he

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:21.610 
you go yes yeah any more weight on it he
ended<00:04:20.450> up<00:04:20.539> putting<00:04:20.959> that<00:04:21.109> lateral<00:04:21.440> side

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
ended up putting that lateral side

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:28.390 
ended up putting that lateral side
closer<00:04:21.859> to<00:04:21.979> the<00:04:22.039> ground<00:04:26.830> but<00:04:27.830> it's<00:04:27.979> still<00:04:28.190> way

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
closer to the ground but it's still way

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:39.880 
closer to the ground but it's still way
under

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:39.890 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.620 

let's<00:04:40.580> take<00:04:40.730> a<00:04:40.760> little<00:04:41.120> bit<00:04:41.270> more<00:04:41.480> of<00:04:41.600> that

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
let's take a little bit more of that

00:04:41.630 --> 00:05:35.100 
let's take a little bit more of that
medium<00:04:42.820> just<00:04:43.820> because<00:04:44.090> that<00:04:44.300> curves<00:04:44.600> around

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.520 

alright<00:05:37.600> there<00:05:38.600> we<00:05:38.630> go<00:05:38.750> that's<00:05:39.260> probably

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
alright there we go that's probably

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.430 
alright there we go that's probably
about<00:05:39.650> all<00:05:39.740> we're<00:05:39.980> gonna<00:05:40.070> do<00:05:40.370> to<00:05:40.490> him<00:05:40.610> today

weeks all right we're gonna have a test

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:47.089 
weeks all right we're gonna have a test
review<00:06:43.919> for<00:06:44.430> anatomy<00:06:45.770> we're<00:06:46.770> doing<00:06:46.979> in<00:06:47.039> the

00:06:47.089 --> 00:06:47.099 
review for anatomy we're doing in the

00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:51.200 
review for anatomy we're doing in the
bunkhouse<00:06:47.400> since<00:06:48.320> their<00:06:49.320> condition<00:06:49.800> has<00:06:50.210> a

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:51.210 
bunkhouse since their condition has a

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.950 
bunkhouse since their condition has a
little<00:06:51.449> bit<00:06:51.539> on<00:06:51.599> the<00:06:51.690> warm<00:06:51.840> side<00:06:51.960> outside<00:06:52.590> so

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:53.960 
little bit on the warm side outside so

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.939 
little bit on the warm side outside so
we've<00:06:54.960> already<00:06:55.080> covered<00:06:55.320> all<00:06:55.500> the<00:06:55.590> stuff<00:06:55.800> in

00:06:55.939 --> 00:06:55.949 
we've already covered all the stuff in

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:57.110 
we've already covered all the stuff in
class<00:06:56.070> so<00:06:56.340> we're<00:06:56.460> going<00:06:56.550> to<00:06:56.610> cover<00:06:56.789> in<00:06:57.000> the

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 
class so we're going to cover in the

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.299 
class so we're going to cover in the
review
