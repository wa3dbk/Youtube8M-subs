00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.860
 Lawn is a very challenging one 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:16.250
 area race cultural landscape we 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:19.220
 People want it in nature 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.630
 not a piece of earth the lawn is it 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.099
 Although there is great knowledge 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.110
 glass surfaces but there is not that 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:26.869
 take English lawn and so much 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.489
 wish to race out of glass too 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.140
 you have to do some things and you can do that 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:31.399
 I really want to know them and I want them 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.210
 like to step for a bit 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.610
 explain step 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.690
 lawn who would have thought that consists of 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.550
 grass like that and we have about 3000 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.240
 grasses grow on this globe 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.830
 but there are only three for the 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.630
 are actually racing with us in Germany 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.120
 at least own three different ones 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.250
 that the ryegrass has that 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.530
 rispe and that is the red swing 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.500
 because it's exactly the grasses that are 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.910
 below can branch and that 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.170
 is called lawn education and 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.760
 accordingly, then the area 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.710
 also be tight when I think that 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.439
 then I look at a relative 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.420
 nice glass what does the gas want to do that 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.220
 gas wants to grow the gas wants to bloom 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.499
 then wants to bring us the hay fever 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.909
 then make seeds and it is 

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:15.729
 contrast distribution has think bigger 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.409
 even just as humans multiply 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.569
 accordingly, the grass has natural 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.520
 also strategies that something happens to us 

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:25.670
 that it will be able to do it from below 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.280
 is to regenerate again 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.179
 that's what he does when lawn mowing then 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.100
 actually do that 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:33.679
 the gas is on these losses 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.109
 set up and made it from the bottom 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:37.850
 her to make a new one for new gear 

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:40.789
 That's why the grass develops quite a bit 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.159
 certain control and control 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:45.670
 Runs on hormones and is hormones 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.560
 are in a blade of grass spikes 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.799
 and from there run with the descending 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.630
 Juice the hormones down and 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:54.529
 suppress down there so the lands 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.630
 small bigger 

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:57.950
 as long as these are intact because the 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.810
 want to grow the want to bloom 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.729
 want to make fruits and 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.429
 Accordingly, everyone is called first 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.829
 energy in the grass that just optimally 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:08.780
 represents when it comes to the way and it 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:12.560
 it was then from time or the cows on 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.180
 the willow what's up there so then 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.190
 we suddenly spiked all the grass 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.760
 away and all this oppression through 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.010
 the hormones fall away 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.349
 and then comes just the saying death is 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.879
 the king then the king is alive then 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.129
 Suddenly the buds can be down there 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.900
 cast out the sleeping eyes and 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.239
 can then be the new rule 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.129
 So take over accordingly 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:36.060
 we the chrysler from the bottom of the 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:37.980
 situation are new shoots to form and themselves 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.340
 to branch in the ground and close to 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.340
 become
