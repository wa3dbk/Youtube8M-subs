beta Tesla cannon now the beta Tesla

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:19.529 
beta Tesla cannon now the beta Tesla
cannon<00:00:18.220> was<00:00:18.430> actually<00:00:18.759> a<00:00:18.789> developer<00:00:19.240> test

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:19.539 
cannon was actually a developer test

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:21.380 
cannon was actually a developer test
weapon<00:00:19.930> that<00:00:20.079> was<00:00:20.140> set<00:00:20.349> outside<00:00:20.860> of<00:00:21.009> the<00:00:21.099> map

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
weapon that was set outside of the map

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.700 
weapon that was set outside of the map
after<00:00:22.390> they<00:00:22.689> were<00:00:22.750> done<00:00:22.960> using<00:00:23.230> it<00:00:23.470> so

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:23.710 
after they were done using it so

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.470 
after they were done using it so
basically<00:00:24.070> what<00:00:24.250> they<00:00:24.369> were<00:00:24.430> doing<00:00:24.880> what

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
basically what they were doing what

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.400 
basically what they were doing what
possessed<00:00:25.719> was<00:00:25.930> doing<00:00:26.110> was<00:00:26.230> they<00:00:26.349> were

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
possessed was doing was they were

possessed was doing was they were
testing<00:00:26.860> out<00:00:26.980> the<00:00:27.099> particle<00:00:27.489> effects<00:00:27.790> for<00:00:27.969> the

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
testing out the particle effects for the

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.850 
testing out the particle effects for the
Tesla<00:00:28.509> cannon<00:00:28.750> which<00:00:29.050> was<00:00:29.230> a<00:00:29.290> weapon<00:00:29.619> that<00:00:29.649> was

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:29.860 
Tesla cannon which was a weapon that was

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.060 
Tesla cannon which was a weapon that was
included<00:00:30.160> in<00:00:30.430> the<00:00:30.520> Broken<00:00:30.880> Steel<00:00:31.029> DLC<00:00:32.070> they

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
included in the Broken Steel DLC they

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.590 
included in the Broken Steel DLC they
didn't<00:00:33.280> have<00:00:33.370> a<00:00:33.399> model<00:00:33.820> for<00:00:33.850> it<00:00:34.059> yet<00:00:34.270> from<00:00:34.480> my

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
didn't have a model for it yet from my

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.720 
didn't have a model for it yet from my
understanding<00:00:34.840> so<00:00:35.350> basically<00:00:36.040> they<00:00:36.280> used<00:00:36.520> a

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
understanding so basically they used a

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.310 
understanding so basically they used a
no<00:00:36.940> they<00:00:37.270> are<00:00:37.390> to<00:00:37.510> use<00:00:37.629> an<00:00:37.780> existing<00:00:37.989> model

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
no they are to use an existing model

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.350 
no they are to use an existing model
which<00:00:38.590> was<00:00:38.710> the<00:00:38.860> missile<00:00:39.190> launcher<00:00:39.579> to<00:00:40.149> test

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
which was the missile launcher to test

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.460 
which was the missile launcher to test
the<00:00:40.450> particle<00:00:40.840> effects<00:00:41.079> and<00:00:41.320> whatever

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
the particle effects and whatever

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.980 
the particle effects and whatever
damaged<00:00:42.280> in<00:00:42.550> the<00:00:42.640> blast<00:00:42.670> and<00:00:43.240> the<00:00:43.600> blast

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:43.990 
damaged in the blast and the blast

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.890 
damaged in the blast and the blast
damage<00:00:44.380> but<00:00:45.250> rather<00:00:45.940> than<00:00:46.180> delete<00:00:46.570> it<00:00:46.720> they

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:46.900 
damage but rather than delete it they

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.319 
damage but rather than delete it they
actually<00:00:47.250> put<00:00:48.250> it<00:00:48.370> outside<00:00:48.730> the<00:00:48.880> map<00:00:49.090> where

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
actually put it outside the map where

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.750 
actually put it outside the map where
it's<00:00:49.450> supposed<00:00:49.989> to<00:00:50.410> be<00:00:50.500> an<00:00:50.710> unobtainable<00:00:51.220> item

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
it's supposed to be an unobtainable item

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.639 
it's supposed to be an unobtainable item
now<00:00:52.660> but<00:00:52.870> today<00:00:53.050> I'm<00:00:53.140> going<00:00:53.260> to<00:00:53.350> show<00:00:53.440> you<00:00:53.470> how

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:54.450 
now but today I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:53.710> get<00:00:53.920> that<00:00:54.100> item

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
to get that item

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.180 
to get that item
pretty<00:00:54.880> easily<00:00:55.060> if<00:00:55.480> you've<00:00:56.410> got<00:00:56.620> the<00:00:56.710> patience

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
pretty easily if you've got the patience

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.910 
pretty easily if you've got the patience

gets killed and you can you can wait to

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:10.230 
gets killed and you can you can wait to
do<00:01:08.020> it<00:01:08.049> after<00:01:08.409> the<00:01:09.100> this<00:01:09.460> part<00:01:09.700> of<00:01:09.759> the<00:01:09.820> DLC

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
that way is where the beta Tesla cannon

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.420 
that way is where the beta Tesla cannon
is<00:01:42.610> actually<00:01:42.970> located<00:01:43.380> however<00:01:44.380> you<00:01:45.220> know<00:01:45.340> you

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
is actually located however you know you

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.160 
is actually located however you know you
can't<00:01:45.790> like<00:01:46.090> jump<00:01:46.390> on<00:01:46.479> these<00:01:46.630> rocks<00:01:46.930> or

utilize<00:01:55.900> a<00:01:56.110> save<00:01:56.560> glitch<00:01:56.979> where<00:01:57.369> you<00:01:57.549> um<00:01:58.110> you

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
utilize a save glitch where you um you

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.170 
utilize a save glitch where you um you
have<00:01:59.200> to<00:01:59.290> like<00:01:59.439> go<00:01:59.680> to<00:01:59.740> the<00:02:00.460> satellite<00:02:00.850> relay

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
have to like go to the satellite relay

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.820 
have to like go to the satellite relay
station<00:02:01.509> over<00:02:01.689> there<00:02:01.720> or<00:02:02.049> the<00:02:02.170> satellites<00:02:02.590> and

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
station over there or the satellites and

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.819 
station over there or the satellites and
you<00:02:02.950> know<00:02:03.070> look<00:02:03.640> up<00:02:03.850> jump<00:02:04.479> save<00:02:04.869> look<00:02:05.380> up<00:02:05.530> jump

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:05.829 
you know look up jump save look up jump

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:07.740 
you know look up jump save look up jump
save<00:02:06.070> and<00:02:06.549> I<00:02:06.670> think<00:02:06.909> that's<00:02:07.060> bullshit<00:02:07.540> you

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
save and I think that's bullshit you

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.429 
save and I think that's bullshit you
don't<00:02:07.869> have<00:02:08.110> to<00:02:08.289> do<00:02:08.439> that<00:02:08.759> basically<00:02:10.439> the

00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:11.439 
don't have to do that basically the

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:13.140 
don't have to do that basically the
easiest<00:02:11.590> way<00:02:11.950> to<00:02:11.980> do<00:02:12.220> it<00:02:12.340> in<00:02:12.400> my<00:02:12.519> opinion<00:02:12.970> is

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
easiest way to do it in my opinion is

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.509 
easiest way to do it in my opinion is
create<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:13.959> staircase<00:02:14.319> out<00:02:14.680> of<00:02:14.799> ammo<00:02:15.129> it's<00:02:15.370> the

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
create a staircase out of ammo it's the

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.370 
create a staircase out of ammo it's the
most<00:02:15.670> simple<00:02:16.120> method<00:02:16.299> it<00:02:16.930> does<00:02:17.170> get

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
most simple method it does get

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.050 
most simple method it does get
frustrating<00:02:17.410> when<00:02:18.069> it<00:02:18.160> topples<00:02:18.550> down<00:02:18.790> but

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
frustrating when it topples down but

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.330 
frustrating when it topples down but
it's<00:02:19.180> a<00:02:19.239> lot<00:02:19.450> more<00:02:19.480> simple<00:02:20.140> and<00:02:20.349> it's<00:02:21.010> not<00:02:21.190> as

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
it's a lot more simple and it's not as

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.100 
it's a lot more simple and it's not as
um<00:02:21.580> comp

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
um comp

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.930 
um comp
X<00:02:22.260> as<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.950> save<00:02:23.610> method<00:02:25.550> basically<00:02:26.550> what<00:02:26.880> you

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
X as the save method basically what you

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.590 
X as the save method basically what you
want<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.150> do<00:02:27.240> is<00:02:27.710> it<00:02:28.710> Fox<00:02:29.520> you<00:02:30.300> want<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.510> take

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
want to do is it Fox you want to take

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.110 
want to do is it Fox you want to take
five<00:02:30.840> point<00:02:31.050> five<00:02:31.260> millimeter<00:02:31.320> rounds<00:02:32.100> let<00:02:33.030> me

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
five point five millimeter rounds let me

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.680 
five point five millimeter rounds let me
show<00:02:33.300> you<00:02:34.070> mo<00:02:35.070> yeah<00:02:35.700> five<00:02:35.940> millimeter<00:02:36.330> rounds

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
show you mo yeah five millimeter rounds

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.720 
show you mo yeah five millimeter rounds
it<00:02:36.840> does<00:02:37.080> it's<00:02:37.860> a<00:02:37.980> little<00:02:38.190> easier<00:02:38.460> to<00:02:38.550> do<00:02:38.640> this

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
it does it's a little easier to do this

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.400 
it does it's a little easier to do this
on<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:38.940> PC<00:02:39.150> version<00:02:39.720> because<00:02:39.900> you<00:02:40.050> have<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.290> go

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
on the PC version because you have to go

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.060 
on the PC version because you have to go
all<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.680> way<00:02:41.900> forward<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:43.110> drop<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.590> rounds

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
all the way forward to drop the rounds

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.880 
all the way forward to drop the rounds
but<00:02:44.550> yeah<00:02:44.820> just<00:02:45.060> you<00:02:45.210> know<00:02:45.240> oh<00:02:45.680> that's<00:02:46.680> wrong

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
but yeah just you know oh that's wrong

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.350 
but yeah just you know oh that's wrong
ammo<00:02:47.220> my<00:02:47.460> bad

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
ammo my bad

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.920 
ammo my bad
where<00:02:48.750> was<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:48.959> five<00:02:49.440> millimeter<00:02:50.160> rounds<00:02:50.610> yeah

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
where was it five millimeter rounds yeah

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.180 
where was it five millimeter rounds yeah
just<00:02:51.930> drop<00:02:52.170> like<00:02:52.230> a<00:02:52.440> bunch<00:02:52.650> of<00:02:52.770> ammo<00:02:52.980> right

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
just drop like a bunch of ammo right

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.980 
just drop like a bunch of ammo right
here<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:53.550> then<00:02:54.180> you<00:02:54.270> just<00:02:54.450> bring<00:02:54.810> it<00:02:54.900> over

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
here and then you just bring it over

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.770 
here and then you just bring it over
here<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:55.290> then<00:02:55.410> you<00:02:55.440> stack<00:02:55.709> it<00:02:55.740> like<00:02:56.070> that<00:02:56.790> and

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
here and then you stack it like that and

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.710 
here and then you stack it like that and
then<00:02:57.959> you<00:02:58.020> make<00:02:58.140> a<00:02:58.170> staircase<00:02:58.410> out<00:02:58.740> of<00:02:58.920> it<00:02:59.720> you

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
then you make a staircase out of it you

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.170 
then you make a staircase out of it you
just<00:03:00.750> use<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.620> click<00:03:01.980> you<00:03:02.220> use<00:03:02.550> the<00:03:02.760> pick<00:03:03.030> up

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
just use the click you use the pick up

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.479 
just use the click you use the pick up
button<00:03:03.470> place<00:03:04.470> it<00:03:04.709> and<00:03:04.860> then<00:03:05.100> make<00:03:05.280> a

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
button place it and then make a

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.790 
button place it and then make a
staircase<00:03:05.760> out<00:03:06.239> of<00:03:06.360> ammo<00:03:06.600> this<00:03:07.410> is<00:03:07.530> kind<00:03:07.709> of

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
staircase out of ammo this is kind of

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.470 
staircase out of ammo this is kind of
flimsy<00:03:08.040> though<00:03:08.430> so<00:03:08.790> you<00:03:08.850> got<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.239> be<00:03:09.300> careful

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
flimsy though so you got to be careful

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.479 
flimsy though so you got to be careful
with<00:03:09.810> it<00:03:09.989> but<00:03:10.200> this<00:03:10.560> is<00:03:10.739> the<00:03:10.830> easiest<00:03:11.190> way<00:03:11.459> to

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
with it but this is the easiest way to

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.160 
with it but this is the easiest way to
get<00:03:11.700> it<00:03:11.850> now<00:03:12.330> I'm<00:03:12.450> going<00:03:12.570> to<00:03:12.630> pick<00:03:12.750> that<00:03:12.780> up<00:03:12.930> so

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
get it now I'm going to pick that up so

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.130 
get it now I'm going to pick that up so
I<00:03:13.200> don't<00:03:13.380> trip<00:03:13.560> on<00:03:13.739> it<00:03:13.770> and<00:03:14.040> then<00:03:14.700> you<00:03:14.940> just<00:03:15.140> I'm

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
I don't trip on it and then you just I'm

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.930 
I don't trip on it and then you just I'm
also<00:03:16.320> going<00:03:16.470> to<00:03:16.530> take<00:03:16.709> off<00:03:16.830> my<00:03:16.950> power<00:03:17.130> armor<00:03:17.670> so

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
also going to take off my power armor so

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.120 
also going to take off my power armor so
I<00:03:17.970> don't<00:03:18.180> you<00:03:18.959> know<00:03:19.080> add<00:03:19.350> any<00:03:19.620> extra<00:03:19.890> weight<00:03:20.070> to

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
I don't you know add any extra weight to

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.360 
I don't you know add any extra weight to
my<00:03:20.400> body<00:03:20.760> and<00:03:21.890> then<00:03:22.890> what<00:03:23.010> you<00:03:23.100> want<00:03:23.220> to<00:03:23.250> do

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
my body and then what you want to do

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.699 
my body and then what you want to do
next<00:03:23.520> is<00:03:23.760> you<00:03:23.910> want<00:03:24.030> to<00:03:24.090> go<00:03:24.510> up<00:03:24.660> here<00:03:24.930> and<00:03:25.590> then

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
next is you want to go up here and then

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.820 
next is you want to go up here and then
just<00:03:25.860> jump<00:03:26.010> on<00:03:26.160> it<00:03:26.959> then<00:03:27.959> jump<00:03:28.230> and<00:03:28.410> then<00:03:28.620> over

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
just jump on it then jump and then over

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.370 
just jump on it then jump and then over
the<00:03:28.920> fence<00:03:29.360> it<00:03:30.360> doesn't<00:03:30.660> matter<00:03:30.780> if<00:03:30.930> your<00:03:31.080> ammo

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
the fence it doesn't matter if your ammo

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.350 
the fence it doesn't matter if your ammo
thing<00:03:31.560> falls<00:03:31.799> over<00:03:31.920> after<00:03:32.280> that<00:03:32.430> I<00:03:32.610> had<00:03:33.090> Fox

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
thing falls over after that I had Fox

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.060 
thing falls over after that I had Fox

accidentally knock it over and then I'm
going<00:03:39.150> to<00:03:39.180> put<00:03:39.330> my<00:03:39.420> power<00:03:39.660> armor<00:03:40.049> back<00:03:40.230> on

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
going to put my power armor back on

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.720 
going to put my power armor back on
because<00:03:40.500> I<00:03:40.650> like<00:03:40.769> the<00:03:40.920> look<00:03:40.950> of<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.370> hellfire

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
because I like the look of the hellfire

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:51.790 
because I like the look of the hellfire
armor<00:03:42.150> and<00:03:42.769> then<00:03:43.769> you're<00:03:43.950> out<00:03:43.980> of<00:03:44.070> the<00:03:44.250> map

rock here jump up hmm there you go there

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:28.040 
rock here jump up hmm there you go there
I<00:04:21.840> go<00:04:22.200> rather<00:04:23.150> now<00:04:24.150> there's<00:04:24.420> a<00:04:24.480> vertibird<00:04:27.050> huh

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
I go rather now there's a vertibird huh

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.920 
I go rather now there's a vertibird huh
um<00:04:29.040> in<00:04:29.340> the<00:04:29.820> that's<00:04:30.090> just<00:04:30.330> an<00:04:30.450> endlessly

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
um in the that's just an endlessly

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.040 
um in the that's just an endlessly
looping<00:04:31.500> a<00:04:31.710> ground<00:04:32.460> texture<00:04:33.030> basically<00:04:33.840> mine

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
looping a ground texture basically mine

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.630 
looping a ground texture basically mine
the<00:04:34.470> Minecraft<00:04:35.310> there<00:04:37.310> and<00:04:38.310> then<00:04:38.430> you<00:04:38.520> wanna

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
the Minecraft there and then you wanna

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.330 
the Minecraft there and then you wanna
come<00:04:38.760> over<00:04:38.850> here<00:04:40.370> past<00:04:41.370> the<00:04:41.640> mountain<00:04:42.000> this

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
come over here past the mountain this

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:56.300 
come over here past the mountain this
this<00:04:44.340> big<00:04:44.610> hole<00:04:44.850> those<00:04:45.120> rocks<00:04:45.330> over<00:04:45.570> there<00:04:45.600> huh

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.370 

then<00:04:57.310> pass<00:04:57.550> this<00:04:57.820> horribly<00:04:58.540> glitched<00:04:58.960> mess

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
then pass this horribly glitched mess

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.900 
then pass this horribly glitched mess
right<00:04:59.680> here<00:05:01.980> it's<00:05:02.980> not<00:05:03.190> solid<00:05:03.490> on<00:05:03.760> the<00:05:03.880> other

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
right here it's not solid on the other

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.200 
right here it's not solid on the other
side<00:05:04.270> but<00:05:04.480> solid<00:05:05.020> on<00:05:05.580> it's<00:05:06.580> not<00:05:06.700> solid<00:05:06.910> on<00:05:07.120> this

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
side but solid on it's not solid on this

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.000

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
side but solid on the other side see I

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.580 
side but solid on the other side see I
just<00:05:09.940> come<00:05:10.060> up<00:05:10.180> here<00:05:10.210> and<00:05:10.450> then<00:05:11.020> this<00:05:11.169> table

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
just come up here and then this table

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.110 
just come up here and then this table
will<00:05:11.980> be<00:05:12.010> right<00:05:12.310> here<00:05:12.490> just<00:05:12.610> out<00:05:12.820> of<00:05:12.940> nowhere

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
will be right here just out of nowhere

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.020 
will be right here just out of nowhere
and<00:05:13.770> here's<00:05:14.770> your<00:05:14.950> beta<00:05:15.160> Tesla<00:05:15.580> can<00:05:15.730> and<00:05:15.910> it's

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
and here's your beta Tesla can and it's

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.850 
and here's your beta Tesla can and it's
just<00:05:16.330> labeled<00:05:16.750> tesla<00:05:17.139> cannon'<00:05:17.440> but<00:05:17.590> you<00:05:17.710> can

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
just labeled tesla cannon' but you can

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.580 
just labeled tesla cannon' but you can
obviously<00:05:18.340> see<00:05:18.870> that<00:05:19.870> is<00:05:20.020> not<00:05:20.169> a<00:05:20.200> tesla

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
obviously see that is not a tesla

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.360 
obviously see that is not a tesla
cannon'<00:05:20.889> that<00:05:21.070> is<00:05:21.220> a<00:05:21.250> missile<00:05:21.790> launcher<00:05:22.240> and

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
cannon' that is a missile launcher and

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.550 
cannon' that is a missile launcher and
then<00:05:24.370> another<00:05:25.360> thing<00:05:25.690> to<00:05:25.840> support<00:05:26.230> the<00:05:26.350> theory

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
then another thing to support the theory

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.230 
then another thing to support the theory
that<00:05:26.680> they<00:05:26.950> were<00:05:27.010> using<00:05:27.250> this<00:05:27.460> as<00:05:27.520> a<00:05:27.640> test<00:05:27.940> at

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
that they were using this as a test at

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.140 
that they were using this as a test at
using<00:05:28.720> this<00:05:29.020> area<00:05:29.380> as<00:05:29.470> a<00:05:29.560> test<00:05:29.940> they<00:05:30.940> have

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
using this area as a test they have

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.530 
using this area as a test they have
right<00:05:31.840> here<00:05:32.550> missiles<00:05:33.550> the<00:05:34.180> interesting

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:34.540 
right here missiles the interesting

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:39.930 
right here missiles the interesting
thing<00:05:34.720> is<00:05:34.930> it<00:05:35.169> doesn't<00:05:35.530> use<00:05:37.680> well<00:05:38.850> let<00:05:39.850> me

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
thing is it doesn't use well let me

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:46.320 
thing is it doesn't use well let me
actually<00:05:40.090> check<00:05:40.480> that<00:05:44.880> yeah<00:05:45.880> it<00:05:46.000> actually

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 
actually check that yeah it actually

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.469 
actually check that yeah it actually
uses<00:05:46.510> missiles<00:05:47.130> rather<00:05:48.130> than<00:05:48.550> micro<00:05:49.090> fusion

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 
uses missiles rather than micro fusion

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:53.250 
uses missiles rather than micro fusion
cells<00:05:49.720> or<00:05:51.330> electron<00:05:52.330> charge<00:05:52.570> packs<00:05:52.900> rather

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:53.260 
cells or electron charge packs rather

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.180 
cells or electron charge packs rather
which<00:05:53.560> is<00:05:53.710> what<00:05:53.919> the<00:05:55.710> regular<00:05:56.710> Tesla<00:05:57.010> cannon

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190 
which is what the regular Tesla cannon

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:03.930 
which is what the regular Tesla cannon
uses<00:06:00.330> and<00:06:01.979> as<00:06:02.979> you<00:06:03.130> can<00:06:03.280> see<00:06:03.340> this<00:06:03.760> is<00:06:03.910> a

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
uses and as you can see this is a

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.520 
uses and as you can see this is a
missile<00:06:04.390> launcher<00:06:04.690> model<00:06:05.020> but<00:06:05.169> look<00:06:05.320> at<00:06:05.440> the

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:05.530 
missile launcher model but look at the

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:10.740 
missile launcher model but look at the
Flint<00:06:05.770> look<00:06:06.760> at<00:06:06.850> the<00:06:06.940> shot<00:06:09.120> it's<00:06:10.120> shooting<00:06:10.539> on

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:10.750 
Flint look at the shot it's shooting on

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.779 
Flint look at the shot it's shooting on
an<00:06:10.930> obvious<00:06:11.350> beam<00:06:11.650> but<00:06:12.130> I'm<00:06:12.370> putting<00:06:12.669> a

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:12.789 
an obvious beam but I'm putting a

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:23.650 
an obvious beam but I'm putting a
missile<00:06:13.180> into<00:06:13.450> the<00:06:16.200> cannon

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:23.660 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.940 

and<00:06:25.220> it<00:06:26.220> does<00:06:26.370> Splash<00:06:26.730> Damage<00:06:26.760> as<00:06:27.300> well<00:06:27.950> just

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:28.950 
and it does Splash Damage as well just

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:41.120 
and it does Splash Damage as well just
like<00:06:29.100> the<00:06:29.220> regular<00:06:29.370> one<00:06:38.270> and<00:06:39.770> if<00:06:40.770> you<00:06:40.920> have<00:06:41.100> a

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:41.130 
like the regular one and if you have a

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:42.590 
like the regular one and if you have a
lot<00:06:41.310> of<00:06:41.340> missiles<00:06:41.790> I<00:06:41.910> mean<00:06:42.060> it's<00:06:42.210> really<00:06:42.450> worth

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:42.600 
lot of missiles I mean it's really worth

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.850 
lot of missiles I mean it's really worth
it<00:06:42.750> if<00:06:42.870> you<00:06:42.900> don't<00:06:43.110> want<00:06:43.230> to<00:06:43.320> bother<00:06:43.410> getting

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860 
it if you don't want to bother getting

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:51.560 
it if you don't want to bother getting
the<00:06:44.690> electron<00:06:45.690> charge<00:06:45.720> backs<00:06:50.270> but<00:06:51.270> yeah<00:06:51.450> this

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:51.570 
the electron charge backs but yeah this

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:53.030 
the electron charge backs but yeah this
is<00:06:51.630> how<00:06:51.810> you<00:06:51.870> get<00:06:52.020> the<00:06:52.080> beta<00:06:52.260> Tesla<00:06:52.590> cannon<00:06:52.770> and

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:53.040 
is how you get the beta Tesla cannon and

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.080 
is how you get the beta Tesla cannon and
I'm<00:06:53.610> going<00:06:53.730> to<00:06:53.790> show<00:06:53.910> you<00:06:54.000> the<00:06:54.090> stats<00:06:54.360> on<00:06:54.600> it<00:06:56.090> it

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:57.090 
I'm going to show you the stats on it it

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.540 
I'm going to show you the stats on it it
has<00:06:57.240> 103<00:06:57.900> damage<00:06:58.260> and<00:06:58.560> since<00:06:59.010> I<00:06:59.070> shot<00:06:59.220> it<00:06:59.340> a<00:06:59.400> few

00:06:59.540 --> 00:06:59.550 
has 103 damage and since I shot it a few

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.930 
has 103 damage and since I shot it a few
times<00:06:59.730> it's<00:06:59.940> not<00:07:00.090> full<00:07:00.360> condition<00:07:01.190> 20<00:07:02.190> 20

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:02.940 
times it's not full condition 20 20

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.890 
times it's not full condition 20 20
pounds<00:07:03.330> value<00:07:03.630> for<00:07:03.870> 21<00:07:04.820> shoots<00:07:05.820> missiles<00:07:06.030> but

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:06.900 
pounds value for 21 shoots missiles but

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.840 
pounds value for 21 shoots missiles but
it<00:07:07.020> shoots<00:07:07.170> an<00:07:07.350> electron<00:07:07.830> charge<00:07:08.250> back<00:07:08.460> beam

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:08.850 
it shoots an electron charge back beam

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:13.820 
it shoots an electron charge back beam
rather<00:07:09.390> than<00:07:11.030> missiles<00:07:12.110> but<00:07:13.110> I<00:07:13.170> hope<00:07:13.590> you<00:07:13.710> guys

I wish you guys luck on the ammo

I wish you guys luck on the ammo
staircase<00:07:20.160> that<00:07:20.400> is<00:07:20.550> it<00:07:20.700> that's<00:07:21.030> kind<00:07:21.330> of<00:07:21.360> a

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:21.450 
staircase that is it that's kind of a

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:23.750 
staircase that is it that's kind of a
difficult<00:07:21.750> thing<00:07:21.780> to<00:07:22.020> do<00:07:22.170> but<00:07:23.010> trust<00:07:23.250> me<00:07:23.490> it's

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:23.760 
difficult thing to do but trust me it's

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.630 
difficult thing to do but trust me it's
a<00:07:23.850> lot<00:07:23.880> more<00:07:24.510> simple<00:07:24.960> than<00:07:24.990> going<00:07:25.800> up<00:07:26.100> on<00:07:26.280> that

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:26.640 
a lot more simple than going up on that

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.170 
a lot more simple than going up on that
rock<00:07:26.880> over<00:07:27.270> there<00:07:28.340> it's<00:07:29.340> like<00:07:29.430> somewhere<00:07:29.910> over

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:30.180 
rock over there it's like somewhere over

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.180 
rock over there it's like somewhere over
there<00:07:30.360> it's<00:07:30.630> like<00:07:30.720> that<00:07:30.900> corner<00:07:31.290> and<00:07:31.800> then

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:32.190 
there it's like that corner and then

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:34.700 
there it's like that corner and then
split<00:07:32.640> saving<00:07:33.150> your<00:07:33.300> way<00:07:33.480> up<00:07:33.750> through<00:07:34.080> there

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:34.710 
split saving your way up through there

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:36.970 
split saving your way up through there
then<00:07:35.220> over<00:07:35.610> here<00:07:35.850> and<00:07:36.060> then<00:07:36.180> down<00:07:36.330> here

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:36.980 
then over here and then down here

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:40.310 
then over here and then down here
because<00:07:37.980> I<00:07:38.400> mean<00:07:39.210> at<00:07:39.360> least<00:07:39.390> with<00:07:39.780> the<00:07:39.960> ammo

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:40.320 
because I mean at least with the ammo

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.000 
because I mean at least with the ammo
staircase<00:07:40.860> you<00:07:40.890> actually<00:07:41.370> have<00:07:41.460> a<00:07:41.490> chance

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:43.010 
staircase you actually have a chance

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:46.100 
staircase you actually have a chance
it's<00:07:44.010> not<00:07:44.190> all<00:07:44.430> up<00:07:44.700> to<00:07:44.730> chance<00:07:45.060> rather<00:07:45.270> so<00:07:46.080> I

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:46.110 
it's not all up to chance rather so I

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:47.420 
it's not all up to chance rather so I
hope<00:07:46.290> you<00:07:46.380> guys<00:07:46.470> enjoyed<00:07:46.770> this<00:07:46.890> video<00:07:47.040> and
