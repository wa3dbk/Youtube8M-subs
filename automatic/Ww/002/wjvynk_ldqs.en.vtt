00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
know the last three years have gotten

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.589 
know the last three years have gotten
quite<00:02:47.519> a<00:02:47.549> bit<00:02:47.700> more<00:02:47.819> competitive<00:02:48.299> and<00:02:48.420> it's

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
quite a bit more competitive and it's

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.860 
quite a bit more competitive and it's
really<00:02:48.900> great<00:02:49.049> to<00:02:49.110> see<00:02:49.670> you<00:02:50.670> know<00:02:50.760> it's<00:02:50.970> it's

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
really great to see you know it's it's

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.530 
really great to see you know it's it's
kind<00:02:52.170> of<00:02:52.200> like<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.880> Williams<00:02:54.390> sisters

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
kind of like the the Williams sisters

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.479 
kind of like the the Williams sisters
you<00:02:55.049> know<00:02:55.079> they<00:02:55.380> push<00:02:55.620> tennis<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.130> a<00:02:56.160> new<00:02:56.340> level

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
you know they push tennis to a new level

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.640 
you know they push tennis to a new level
and<00:02:56.880> I<00:02:57.090> think<00:02:57.750> there's<00:02:57.900> quite<00:02:58.079> a<00:02:58.110> few<00:02:58.200> girls<00:02:58.560> in

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
and I think there's quite a few girls in

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.280 
and I think there's quite a few girls in
the<00:02:58.769> world<00:02:58.860> cup<00:02:59.069> right<00:02:59.250> now<00:02:59.370> they're<00:02:59.610> skiing

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
the world cup right now they're skiing

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.780 
the world cup right now they're skiing
amazingly<00:03:01.290> well<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:01.500> and<00:03:01.980> you<00:03:02.549> know<00:03:02.670> we're

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
amazingly well and and you know we're

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.030 
amazingly well and and you know we're
trying<00:03:03.090> to<00:03:03.239> to<00:03:03.569> push<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:04.410> rest<00:03:04.620> of<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:04.829> field

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
trying to to push the rest of the field

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.280 
trying to to push the rest of the field
into<00:03:05.430> that<00:03:05.579> direction<00:03:05.760> so<00:03:06.360> I<00:03:06.569> think<00:03:06.930> it's<00:03:07.170> only

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
into that direction so I think it's only

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.699 
into that direction so I think it's only
positive<00:03:07.890> for<00:03:08.069> the<00:03:08.099> sport

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.649 

you've<00:03:14.709> been<00:03:15.280> through<00:03:15.579> hell<00:03:15.760> recently<00:03:16.299> you

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:16.659 
you've been through hell recently you

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:18.390 
you've been through hell recently you
can't<00:03:16.900> tell<00:03:17.170> by<00:03:17.200> looking<00:03:17.680> at<00:03:17.709> you<00:03:17.799> your

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
can't tell by looking at you your

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.339 
can't tell by looking at you your
journey<00:03:18.700> is<00:03:18.939> something<00:03:19.569> that<00:03:19.689> no<00:03:19.900> one<00:03:20.079> want<00:03:20.290> to

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
journey is something that no one want to

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:22.410 
journey is something that no one want to
go<00:03:20.470> through<00:03:20.680> let<00:03:20.860> alone<00:03:20.890> and<00:03:21.400> athlete<00:03:21.790> but

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
go through let alone and athlete but

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.300 
go through let alone and athlete but
coming<00:03:22.689> back<00:03:22.810> and<00:03:23.290> having<00:03:23.500> four<00:03:23.950> victories

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310

coming back and having four victories
back-to-back<00:03:25.090> and<00:03:25.420> and<00:03:26.110> the<00:03:26.230> one<00:03:26.409> I<00:03:26.439> found<00:03:26.769> the

back-to-back and and the one I found the

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.470 
back-to-back and and the one I found the
most<00:03:27.430> special<00:03:27.730> was<00:03:27.970> when<00:03:28.090> you<00:03:28.180> came<00:03:28.269> through

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
most special was when you came through

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.780 
most special was when you came through
the<00:03:28.569> finish<00:03:28.720> at<00:03:28.989> Beaver<00:03:29.260> Creek<00:03:29.470> and<00:03:29.769> it<00:03:30.340> wasn't

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
the finish at Beaver Creek and it wasn't

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.759 
the finish at Beaver Creek and it wasn't
like<00:03:31.000> a<00:03:31.030> joy<00:03:31.390> or<00:03:31.629> ecstasy<00:03:31.959> on<00:03:32.109> your<00:03:32.349> face<00:03:32.560> like

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
late Louise it was pure relief yeah it's

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:36.780 
late Louise it was pure relief yeah it's
been<00:03:35.319> definitely<00:03:35.920> an<00:03:36.189> extremely<00:03:36.670> difficult

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
been definitely an extremely difficult

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
been definitely an extremely difficult
but<00:03:37.799> Beaver<00:03:38.799> Creek<00:03:39.010> was<00:03:39.450> probably<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:40.659> most
