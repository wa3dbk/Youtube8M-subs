00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 which screen in our dailies we can 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.970
 to be used that all but light 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.620
 finally as a source of energy 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.820
 these energy sources in fact we 're going 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.110
 worry through a material 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.700
 photovoltaic we know who is 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.860
 whoever you 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.240
 on a roof 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.830
 we will make us transparent by a 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.150
 day system 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.280
 in fact if we look for example on 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.930
 this screen the decomposition 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.120
 the component and composed the 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.789
 photovoltaic optics and 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.289
 electrode 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.849
 and we will integrate it directly into the 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.039
 phone with builders be 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.840
 from either the phone above or 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.640
 below the touch screen and finally 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.200
 we put it directly natively in the 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.820
 phone is a term of 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.190
 features we will recover 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.440
 artificial light energy or 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.269
 natural to be able to behind produce 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.379
 of energy and add that autonomy 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:49.489
 battery in the TV is a bit 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:54.450
 the equivalent of a solar panel 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:57.330
 transparent in the screen recovers 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.940
 the official or natural energy we had 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.800
 directly transmit the battery so 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.860
 roughly you will recover according to 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.900
 cases of uses we consider 20% 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.950
 additional energy compared to 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.960
 what a battery can provide you 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.120
 today and in the case of uses 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.200
 that can be considered easy to 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.900
 solve 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.890
 a phone that is idle consumes 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.540
 today the energy 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.250
 when he's next to you it's in 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.540
 train to work on your desk and 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.820
 consuming nothing at all because we're going 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.710
 compensate for the energy needs of 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.050
 this eve of other systems by 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.630
 example the fact of using listen to the 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.920
 music one would fight on behalf could 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.670
 be compensated by the light we 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.590
 retrieves a smartphone that hold 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.479
 almost to infinity in the final standby the 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.130
 here we are , let's say clearly to six cantons 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.690
 in principle this is the theoretical principle 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.670
 it's this one infinite on standby 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.800
 after we know that phones move 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.660
 they are never always exposed to a 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.090
 light ensures if it is in a pocket 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.040
 or other acts them mans and let's say 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.619
 after that so that to be totally 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.330
 honest the light that we will recover in 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.420
 indoor and outdoor and a 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.039
 different power so the scenario of 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.090
 total compensation will be earlier either 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:06.969
 outside scenario 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.679
 okay and so suddenly wanted it 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:10.060
 to seduce the builders a little 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.000
 whether they integrate your technologies or 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.560
 are you assaulted and in the end for 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.360
 for example the sale of coke or 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.160
 accessories to add that on their 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.810
 smartphone so we're here instead of a 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.549
 crystal frame on a technology 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.549
 purely we will say b to b 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.340
 this technology be to be it has 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.739
 embedded here for example directly in 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.380
 the phone that a nokia phone from 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:38.410
 market that we customize to integrate 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.390
 the phone component directly 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.200
 in the phone 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.780
 the demonstration that we can make 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.850
 is that behind by plugging this little 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.190
 additional accessory I'm going 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.390
 charge the phone this guy 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.580
 accessory is simply a 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.630
 component renoir here we did not have the 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.459
 right to put in the phone while 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.310
 only okay will pass for a 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.410
 charger coming out the current again a 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.950
 sense it's coming in like a like 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.950
 a traditional charger 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.410
 when I exposed the phone to a 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.610
 light 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.000
 he'll be recognized after a few 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.000
 seconds 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:21.040
 thomas charge there you see up at 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:22.450
 right nikon charging who are flashing 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.829
 the boot was a little bit more 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.120
 long because it had to be verified that the 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:26.469
 loader was authorized by the 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.540
 phone these are protections 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:30.310
 inherent to the phone and to come back 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.719
 to your initial question we work 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.790
 actually with the manufacturers 

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:35.680
 screens for this type of components 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.329
 be directly in the screen there 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.370
 tendency to have a maximum of 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:43.030
 components in the same screen in the 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.709
 even by the way the same the same cell 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.109
 so we work with its manufacturers 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.819
 of screens with the dancer integrators 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:51.129
 the marks themselves that will define 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:53.079
 the phone for this is also the 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:56.349
 finest possible the most suited to their 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:59.230
 terminal needs product and it goes from 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:00.730
 phone to the tablet at the label of 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.919
 two square centimeters that we can have 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.560
 in a supermarket from there in the frame 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:09.669
 from this trade show the 'b to b' to 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.919
 crystal and and dredge the manufacturers 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:13.359
 of components and products by cons 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:15.010
 it's true we have other technologies 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:16.329
 that are not shown here but who 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.789
 could actually adapt to a 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.130
 hull type accessory to one will be on 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:22.389
 a promise also said and on a 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.220
 different technology 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:26.889
 the principle of this technology is 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.539
 the sooner to dial it the 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.520
 photovoltaic in a hull of 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:33.300
 protection and but it is not 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.300
 presented today
