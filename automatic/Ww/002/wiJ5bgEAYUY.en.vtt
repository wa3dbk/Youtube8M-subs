damaging as you can see that's the color
and<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.690> map<00:00:55.680> i'm<00:00:55.860> actually<00:00:56.010> playing<00:00:56.399> on<00:00:56.699> is

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
and the map i'm actually playing on is

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.229 
and the map i'm actually playing on is
called<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.510> think<00:00:57.989> achievement<00:00:58.739> Idol<00:00:59.340> it's<00:01:00.210> a

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
called I think achievement Idol it's a

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.939 
called I think achievement Idol it's a
pretty<00:01:00.390> cool<00:01:00.570> map<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:00.960> can<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.590> best<00:01:01.800> thing

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
pretty cool map you can the best thing

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.039 
pretty cool map you can the best thing
the<00:01:02.160> best<00:01:02.190> character<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.059> think<00:01:03.300> in<00:01:03.660> this<00:01:03.780> map

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
the best character I think in this map

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.920 
the best character I think in this map
is<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.500> scalp<00:01:05.220> because<00:01:05.570> when<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.659> jump<00:01:06.869> down

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
is the scalp because when you jump down

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.719 
is the scalp because when you jump down
to<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.290> arena<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.890> can't<00:01:08.070> actually<00:01:08.189> get<00:01:08.520> back

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
to the arena you can't actually get back

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.670 
to the arena you can't actually get back
up<00:01:08.939> unless<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.479> feel<00:01:09.630> like<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.840> dispenser<00:01:10.530> down

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
up unless you feel like a dispenser down

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.280 
up unless you feel like a dispenser down
there<00:01:11.090> which<00:01:12.090> people<00:01:12.570> can<00:01:12.659> destroy<00:01:13.049> really

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
there which people can destroy really

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.910 
there which people can destroy really
easily<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:15.450> best<00:01:15.630> thing<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.869> do<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.320> be<00:01:16.890> a

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
easily so the best thing to do is be a

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.740 
easily so the best thing to do is be a
Scouts<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.790> can<00:01:17.909> actually<00:01:18.000> jump<00:01:18.390> back<00:01:18.570> up

now<00:03:56.430> let's<00:03:56.610> talk<00:03:56.790> about<00:03:56.850> the<00:03:57.390> price<00:03:58.110> on<00:03:58.470> the

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
now let's talk about the price on the

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.290 
now let's talk about the price on the
the<00:03:59.910> man<00:04:00.150> coastal<00:04:00.720> now<00:04:00.900> this<00:04:01.110> gun<00:04:01.890> is<00:04:02.300> two

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
the man coastal now this gun is two

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:09.470 
the man coastal now this gun is two
dollars<00:04:03.570> 49<00:04:03.960> on<00:04:04.260> 2050<00:04:05.510> us<00:04:07.160> which<00:04:08.160> is<00:04:08.430> I<00:04:08.670> guess<00:04:09.270> a

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
dollars 49 on 2050 us which is I guess a

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.290 
dollars 49 on 2050 us which is I guess a
bit<00:04:10.430> hefty<00:04:11.430> on<00:04:11.520> price<00:04:12.560> but<00:04:13.970> if<00:04:14.970> you<00:04:15.090> talk<00:04:15.270> about

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
bit hefty on price but if you talk about

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.289 
bit hefty on price but if you talk about
other<00:04:15.540> weapons<00:04:15.960> like<00:04:16.549> like<00:04:17.549> the<00:04:17.670> snipers<00:04:18.269> that

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
other weapons like like the snipers that

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.440 
other weapons like like the snipers that
cause<00:04:18.570> like<00:04:18.750> nine<00:04:19.320> dollars<00:04:19.709> each<00:04:19.890> so<00:04:19.920> I<00:04:20.519> think

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
cause like nine dollars each so I think

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.490 
cause like nine dollars each so I think
that's<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:21.630> highest<00:04:22.019> and<00:04:22.850> money<00:04:23.850> for<00:04:24.270> the

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
that's the highest and money for the

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.140 
that's the highest and money for the
shotguns<00:04:25.500> don't<00:04:25.740> don't<00:04:26.280> quote<00:04:26.850> me<00:04:27.000> on<00:04:27.030> that

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
shotguns don't don't quote me on that

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.700 
shotguns don't don't quote me on that

and the good thing about this map is
eventually<00:05:00.600> if<00:05:01.320> you<00:05:01.380> see<00:05:01.710> I've<00:05:02.160> you<00:05:02.400> a<00:05:02.430> pro<00:05:02.940> tf2

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
eventually if you see I've you a pro tf2

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.920 
eventually if you see I've you a pro tf2
player<00:05:03.810> you<00:05:04.350> can<00:05:04.470> actually<00:05:04.590> see<00:05:04.770> the<00:05:05.930> like

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
player you can actually see the like

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.710 
player you can actually see the like
they<00:05:07.110> can<00:05:07.260> actually<00:05:07.380> see<00:05:07.770> the<00:05:08.360> difference<00:05:09.360> in

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
they can actually see the difference in

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.980 
they can actually see the difference in
the<00:05:10.200> atmosphere<00:05:11.100> this<00:05:11.610> is<00:05:11.790> like<00:05:12.000> it's<00:05:12.450> really

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
the atmosphere this is like it's really

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.860 
the atmosphere this is like it's really
dense<00:05:13.230> atmosphere<00:05:13.500> and<00:05:14.130> you<00:05:15.000> see<00:05:15.240> me<00:05:15.360> jump<00:05:15.690> I

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
dense atmosphere and you see me jump I

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.000 
dense atmosphere and you see me jump I
jump<00:05:15.900> like<00:05:16.380> halfway<00:05:16.650> across<00:05:17.070> the<00:05:17.160> map<00:05:17.520> and

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.010 
jump like halfway across the map and

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.500 
jump like halfway across the map and
that<00:05:20.010> is<00:05:20.130> because<00:05:20.250> this<00:05:20.670> I<00:05:20.910> don't<00:05:21.270> know<00:05:21.360> what's

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
that is because this I don't know what's

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.310 
that is because this I don't know what's
wrong<00:05:21.690> with<00:05:21.840> this<00:05:21.930> map<00:05:22.200> it<00:05:22.410> it's<00:05:24.320> deliberately

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
wrong with this map it it's deliberately

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.640 
wrong with this map it it's deliberately
made<00:05:25.740> like<00:05:25.950> that<00:05:26.660> and<00:05:27.660> we<00:05:27.720> jump<00:05:28.080> get<00:05:28.290> when<00:05:28.560> you

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
made like that and we jump get when you

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.070 
made like that and we jump get when you
do<00:05:28.770> like<00:05:28.890> one<00:05:29.130> jumping<00:05:29.550> jump<00:05:29.790> so<00:05:30.000> high<00:05:30.080> don't

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
do like one jumping jump so high don't

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.690 
do like one jumping jump so high don't
just<00:05:31.260> like<00:05:31.380> you<00:05:31.590> just<00:05:31.770> slightly<00:05:32.160> fall<00:05:32.460> to<00:05:32.610> the

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
just like you just slightly fall to the

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:41.300 
just like you just slightly fall to the
ground<00:05:32.730> you<00:05:33.150> can<00:05:33.210> see<00:05:33.450> them<00:05:35.330> jumping<00:05:36.330> there

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.690
