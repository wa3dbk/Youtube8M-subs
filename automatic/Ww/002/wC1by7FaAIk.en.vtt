00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.699
 do not 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.790
 welcome to sport age with you is 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.560
 part and hassan in our second 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.260
 chapter of the multiple classics 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:49.250
 disconnecting construcc 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.780
 hello troop goofy with classic disney 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.860
 singing 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.860
 good in this game 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.310
 of the same name from the late 80's and 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.370
 about 90 whose main character was in 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:06.230
 buffet and your son max something a bit 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:11.990
 strange as we have said before 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:14.720
 with the father park is usually given in the 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.840
 Disney adventure with families 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.840
 single parent 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.840
 good in this game as I said the first 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.789
 and the second player can be distributed to 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.890
 the last maximum characters wish 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:34.210
 in a lot of combinations 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:37.619
 as bu filmax maximum film office in max 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.619
 and maxim gofio 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.890
 good 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.040
 the town is likewise a game of 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.840
 platforms where the main 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.840
 adventures are defeating enemies 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:59.170
 base to the objects that are going 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.030
 finding and picking 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.400
 the game has a broad base of 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.650
 cooperation in fact I believe that the 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:10.239
 era that mostly uses the theme of 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:14.069
 copp with the differences skills that 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:16.350
 has each of the characters 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.620
 shape 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.040
 for example max is faster and causes 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.040
 more damage 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:33.170
 its good way made it difficult for us 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.050
 slower goofy 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.390
 well the game's argument basically 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.370
 A little bit of track kept in the game 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.650
 so 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.530
 instant vacation I saw him kidnapped 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.940
 your friend and you have to rescue him from 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.250
 hands of these pirates but it's a 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.550
 most was set of these 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:55.700
 shapes 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:58.360
 about the graphics of the park sounds 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.360
 love music 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:09.000
 But what they seemed to me pretty 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.000
 flashy and old 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.920
 a second aspect midday of July 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.970
 and I important the graphics could be 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.890
 that are good 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.890
 cooking what when 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.939
 fairly good 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:44.340
 as a more strategic aspect and the 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.340
 terms 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:52.240
 it could be a pretty game that is not 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:55.180
 designed for 8 year old children how could 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:04:01.060
 think of a distance with the 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:02.560
 difficulty that we have now cost us 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.170
 quite 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:10.410
 and a training 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.410
 they make it easier 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:19.190
 and the final enemy that although it is not very 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:21.220
 difficult is quite tough and that with 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.170
 many blows 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.889
 and minimum ten minutes let's ask and good 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:28.340
 Clear 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:30.110
 and good the main one is that the agreement 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.790
 it's about his great 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.790
 I can last five stages 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.090
 nail 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.100
 the last one is there 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:48.180
 the game is so good in 61 that it leaves 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.490
 the feeling of wanting more because it was not 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.220
 enough those five stages should 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.650
 have something more than what one tends to 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.090
 think is that the developers fields 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.110
 They did not have her many pursuits by 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.110
 now as distance 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:07.800
 they came because many maybe they can 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:07.800
 remember 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:14.399
 good reviews and if they will not play it 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.779
 leave the possibility and you can try and 

00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:19.199
 because he wants to like it 

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:19.199
 recommendable 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.780
 good as a bonus 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:47.440
 false reaction of surprise I can say 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:49.930
 that we have thought of a beginning in 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.889
 make a video dedicated to this game of 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:55.159
 wimax 2 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:56.720
 tropic island and the name 

00:05:55.159 --> 00:06:01.040
 Right 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:04.220
 the game efe 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:07.000
 these memories of children boys 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.000
 yes 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:26.960
 but now playing it again kills passions 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:30.250
 that jump in a dynamic way the 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.250
 movements are bad 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:44.650
 something like the best look 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:47.650
 the game leaves a lot to be desired in 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:50.950
 sound terms in terms of grace 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:53.639
 more music gameplay speed 

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:57.450
 of the game many things I think that 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:57.450
 I contributed completely 

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:09.970
 I do not know the truth I do not know if you have 

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:11.530
 best opinions regarding this game 

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:13.750
 but we are left with the 

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:16.080
 quite negative opinion by returning it to 

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.080
 to play 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.639
 and here we would end with the chapter of 

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:29.920
 today 

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:35.610
 excuse me please no without max 

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:35.610
 well the same so there is a fan out there 

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.729
 well I recommend in other games that 

00:07:43.659 --> 00:07:47.620
 they want us to remember for you 

00:07:45.729 --> 00:07:49.620
 they also remember it remember 

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:52.860
 all the memories 

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:57.560
 if you have a classic and want nss 

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:57.560
 women eat tender like they subscribe 

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:02.840
 it's because of his daughters
