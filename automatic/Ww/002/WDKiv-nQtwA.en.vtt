they give a nice abrasive edge to share
for<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.430> window<00:01:11.820> then<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.840> can<00:01:13.140> say<00:01:13.260> they're

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
for that window then I can say they're

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.560 
for that window then I can say they're
not<00:01:13.560> particularly<00:01:14.070> aggressive<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:15.030> they<00:01:15.420> can

the port window in about one to one and

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.929 
the port window in about one to one and
a<00:01:48.600> half<00:01:48.630> millimeters<00:01:49.380> with<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.579> combustion

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
a half millimeters with the combustion

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.300 
a half millimeters with the combustion
chamber<00:01:51.329> in<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.020> longitudinal

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
chamber in this in the longitudinal

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.920 
chamber in this in the longitudinal
direction<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:53.700> let's<00:01:53.880> just<00:01:54.030> go<00:01:54.149> if<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.420> makes<00:01:54.810> a

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
direction so let's just go if it makes a

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.719 
direction so let's just go if it makes a
whole<00:01:55.170> lot<00:01:55.350> easier<00:01:55.380> if<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.280> got<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.460> right

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
whole lot easier if you got a right

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.789 
whole lot easier if you got a right
angle<00:01:57.149> like<00:01:57.180> this<00:01:57.329> that's<00:01:58.140> really<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.649> me

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
angle like this that's really to me

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.200 
angle like this that's really to me
that's<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.219> only<00:01:59.280> way<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.579> do<00:01:59.759> it<00:01:59.880> so<00:02:00.000> here<00:02:00.180> we

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
that's the only way to do it so here we

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.649 
that's the only way to do it so here we
go

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
go

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.160 
go
let's<00:02:00.960> go<00:02:01.079> just<00:02:01.409> do<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.590> little<00:02:01.649> shearing<00:02:02.189> here

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
let's go just do a little shearing here

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.100 
let's go just do a little shearing here
right<00:02:04.170> along<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.710> edge<00:02:05.540> that<00:02:06.540> works<00:02:06.810> really

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
right along the edge that works really

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.320 
right along the edge that works really
well<00:02:07.380> if<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.649> vary<00:02:08.099> your<00:02:08.369> angle<00:02:08.849> there

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
well if you vary your angle there

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.460 
well if you vary your angle there
very

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
very

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.500 
very
angle<00:02:10.860> you're<00:02:11.730> just<00:02:11.880> watching<00:02:12.090> right<00:02:12.480> a

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
angle you're just watching right a

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.010 
angle you're just watching right a
little<00:02:12.840> edge<00:02:14.210> let's<00:02:15.210> do<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.480> same<00:02:15.660> thing<00:02:15.720> on

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
little edge let's do the same thing on

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.740 
little edge let's do the same thing on
this<00:02:16.110> side<00:02:16.170> over<00:02:16.470> here<00:02:16.790> and<00:02:17.790> keep<00:02:18.120> keep<00:02:18.570> the

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
this side over here and keep keep the

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.050 
this side over here and keep keep the
bar<00:02:18.930> moving<00:02:19.340> keep<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.520> little<00:02:20.730> diamond

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
bar moving keep the little diamond

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.410 
bar moving keep the little diamond
cutter<00:02:21.270> moving<00:02:22.220> and<00:02:23.220> you're<00:02:23.880> kind<00:02:24.090> of<00:02:24.120> control

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
cutter moving and you're kind of control

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.390 
cutter moving and you're kind of control
it<00:02:24.540> just<00:02:24.750> stop<00:02:24.930> feel<00:02:25.230> you're<00:02:26.040> controlling

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
it just stop feel you're controlling

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.280 
it just stop feel you're controlling
your<00:02:26.700> depth<00:02:26.970> into<00:02:27.300> there<00:02:27.450> like<00:02:27.480> I<00:02:27.720> said<00:02:27.750> you

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
your depth into there like I said you

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.380 
your depth into there like I said you
want<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:28.530> go<00:02:28.680> about<00:02:28.950> half<00:02:29.430> a<00:02:29.640> millimeter<00:02:29.880> into

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
want to go about half a millimeter into

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.600 
want to go about half a millimeter into
the<00:02:31.050> port<00:02:31.320> window<00:02:31.710> one<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.430> a<00:02:32.460> half

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
the port window one and a half

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.310 
the port window one and a half
millimeters<00:02:32.880> in<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.540> light<00:02:33.720> you<00:02:33.960> know<00:02:34.050> down

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
millimeters in the light you know down

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.000 
millimeters in the light you know down
this<00:02:34.530> way

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
this way

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.670 
this way
from<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.490> edge<00:02:35.670> in<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.240> longitude<00:02:36.750> erection

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
from the edge in the longitude erection

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.650 
from the edge in the longitude erection
and<00:02:37.830> just<00:02:38.070> keep<00:02:38.250> working<00:02:38.670> it<00:02:38.790> until<00:02:38.970> you<00:02:39.510> get

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
and just keep working it until you get

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.330 
and just keep working it until you get
those<00:02:39.870> dimensions<00:02:40.500> that<00:02:40.650> you're<00:02:40.800> looking<00:02:41.130> for

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
those dimensions that you're looking for

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.540 
those dimensions that you're looking for
if<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:42.450> bar<00:02:42.900> starts<00:02:43.290> hesitated<00:02:44.220> or<00:02:44.280> skipped

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
if the bar starts hesitated or skipped

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.520 
if the bar starts hesitated or skipped
there<00:02:44.730> a<00:02:44.760> little<00:02:44.940> bit<00:02:45.090> just<00:02:45.570> bury<00:02:45.930> your<00:02:46.140> angles

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
there a little bit just bury your angles

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.890 
there a little bit just bury your angles
vary<00:02:46.800> your<00:02:46.920> angle<00:02:47.250> like<00:02:47.820> I<00:02:47.970> said<00:02:48.150> keep<00:02:48.420> moving

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
vary your angle like I said keep moving

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.220 
vary your angle like I said keep moving
keep<00:02:49.080> moving<00:02:50.180> it<00:02:51.180> puts<00:02:51.600> a<00:02:51.690> nice<00:02:51.870> little<00:02:52.140> edge

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
keep moving it puts a nice little edge

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.530 
keep moving it puts a nice little edge
now<00:02:52.709> a<00:02:52.740> really<00:02:53.100> good<00:02:53.280> instrument<00:02:53.940> for<00:02:54.150> feeling

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
now a really good instrument for feeling

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.870 
now a really good instrument for feeling
that<00:02:54.690> it's<00:02:54.930> what<00:02:55.200> God<00:02:55.860> gifted<00:02:56.370> you<00:02:56.520> with<00:02:56.550> the

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
that it's what God gifted you with the

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.190 
that it's what God gifted you with the
call<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.240> finger<00:02:57.480> you<00:02:57.600> can<00:02:57.720> just<00:02:57.870> reach<00:02:58.050> in

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
call to finger you can just reach in

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.620 
call to finger you can just reach in
there<00:02:58.230> feel<00:02:58.620> kind<00:02:59.340> of<00:02:59.400> how<00:02:59.670> smooth<00:03:00.390> that<00:03:00.420> is

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
there feel kind of how smooth that is

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.780 
there feel kind of how smooth that is
now<00:03:01.230> at<00:03:01.500> this<00:03:01.650> point<00:03:01.920> we<00:03:02.100> have<00:03:02.280> a<00:03:02.310> little<00:03:02.670> bit

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
now at this point we have a little bit

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.600 
now at this point we have a little bit
of<00:03:02.820> a<00:03:03.090> burr<00:03:03.570> back<00:03:03.900> there<00:03:04.170> because<00:03:05.100> we<00:03:05.430> haven't

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
of a burr back there because we haven't

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.730 
of a burr back there because we haven't
went<00:03:05.910> through<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.240> next<00:03:07.170> step<00:03:07.380> so<00:03:07.590> we're

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
went through the next step so we're

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.150 
went through the next step so we're
going<00:03:07.860> to<00:03:07.950> go<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.070> the<00:03:08.280> next<00:03:08.490> step<00:03:08.760> okay
