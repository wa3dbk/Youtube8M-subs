Mark and this is my garden and I just

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.120 
Mark and this is my garden and I just
came<00:00:12.389> into<00:00:12.599> some<00:00:12.870> information<00:00:13.080> about<00:00:13.620> ocean

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
came into some information about ocean

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.790 
came into some information about ocean
water<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.610> how<00:00:15.269> it's<00:00:15.509> really<00:00:16.410> really

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
water and how it's really really

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.330 
water and how it's really really
important<00:00:17.400> or<00:00:18.710> beneficial<00:00:19.710> for<00:00:20.100> your<00:00:20.189> home

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
garden and you know it contradicts all

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.560 
garden and you know it contradicts all
the<00:00:22.830> research<00:00:23.160> out<00:00:23.340> there<00:00:23.400> that<00:00:23.730> says<00:00:23.939> hey<00:00:24.539> you

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
the research out there that says hey you

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.170 
the research out there that says hey you
know<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.769> salt<00:00:26.039> mixture<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.519> sodium<00:00:26.910> content

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
know the salt mixture the sodium content

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.089 
know the salt mixture the sodium content
from<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.630> ocean<00:00:27.900> water<00:00:28.080> it's<00:00:28.650> gonna<00:00:28.800> kill<00:00:29.070> the

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
from the ocean water it's gonna kill the

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.339 
from the ocean water it's gonna kill the
plants<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.640> shrubs<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.119> trees<00:00:30.510> actually

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
plants the shrubs the trees actually

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.659 
plants the shrubs the trees actually
that's<00:00:31.439> all<00:00:31.619> false<00:00:31.920> I've<00:00:32.309> been<00:00:32.460> doing<00:00:32.610> this

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
that's all false I've been doing this

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.520 
that's all false I've been doing this
for<00:00:32.850> last<00:00:33.000> few<00:00:33.180> months<00:00:33.420> I've<00:00:33.540> seen<00:00:33.719> phenomenal

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
for last few months I've seen phenomenal

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.410 
for last few months I've seen phenomenal
results<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:35.489> come<00:00:35.640> on<00:00:35.730> along<00:00:35.760> with<00:00:35.910> me<00:00:36.239> and

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
results so come on along with me and

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.569 
results so come on along with me and
I'll<00:00:36.480> show<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.719> what<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:36.899> do<00:00:36.960> okay<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.620> actually

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
I'll show you what I do okay I actually

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.540 
I'll show you what I do okay I actually
live<00:00:38.969> about<00:00:39.530> twelve<00:00:40.530> miles<00:00:40.710> from<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.430> Pacific

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
live about twelve miles from the Pacific

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.729 
live about twelve miles from the Pacific
Ocean<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.360> so<00:00:42.719> what<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:42.960> do<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.440> go<00:00:43.559> down

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
Ocean and so what I do is I go down

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.279 
Ocean and so what I do is I go down
about<00:00:43.920> once<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.219> week<00:00:44.250> or<00:00:44.520> every<00:00:44.610> two<00:00:44.730> weeks<00:00:45.289> and

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
about once a week or every two weeks and

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.590 
about once a week or every two weeks and
get<00:00:46.469> me<00:00:46.590> some<00:00:46.739> ocean<00:00:46.860> water<00:00:47.300> yeah<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.329> just<00:00:48.390> kind

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
get me some ocean water yeah I just kind

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.779 
get me some ocean water yeah I just kind
of<00:00:48.800> go<00:00:49.800> over<00:00:49.860> here<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.129> pour<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.340> on<00:00:50.399> my<00:00:50.489> garden

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:01:02.330 

come<00:00:53.789> on<00:00:53.879> in<00:00:58.340> kind<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.370> get<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.609> all<00:00:59.730> wet<00:01:01.340> and

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
come on in kind of get it all wet and

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.600 
come on in kind of get it all wet and
what<00:01:02.520> happens<00:01:02.879> is<00:01:03.059> actually<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:04.610> increases

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
what happens is actually is increases

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.719 
what happens is actually is increases
the<00:01:05.700> osmosis<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.600> cells<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.500> get<00:01:07.729> ATP

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
the osmosis of the cells to get ATP

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.460 
the osmosis of the cells to get ATP
energy<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.720> plants<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.110> shrubs<00:01:10.380> and

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
energy to the plants and shrubs and

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.310 
energy to the plants and shrubs and
trees<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.610> actually<00:01:12.110> becomes<00:01:13.110> very

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
trees so it actually becomes very

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.590 
trees so it actually becomes very
efficient<00:01:13.770> for<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.159> cells<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.119> plants<00:01:15.450> to

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
efficient for the cells of the plants to

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.030 
efficient for the cells of the plants to
use<00:01:15.780> all<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.020> energy<00:01:16.140> from<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.650> nutrients

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
use all the energy from the nutrients

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.679 
use all the energy from the nutrients
and<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.189> balancing<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.640> soil<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.299> sodium

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
and the balancing of the soil the sodium

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.120 
and the balancing of the soil the sodium
does<00:01:18.840> not<00:01:19.020> kill<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.350> plants<00:01:19.770> there's<00:01:19.920> enough

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
does not kill the plants there's enough

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.649 
does not kill the plants there's enough
balancing<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.909> soil<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.240> counterbalance

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
balancing in the soil to counterbalance

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.749 
balancing in the soil to counterbalance
any<00:01:22.049> sodium<00:01:22.409> issues<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:23.490> it's<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.640> good

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
any sodium issues so it's a good

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.910 
any sodium issues so it's a good
strategy<00:01:24.000> for<00:01:24.390> fertilization<00:01:27.770> those<00:01:28.770> were

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
strategy for fertilization those were

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.560 
strategy for fertilization those were
the<00:01:29.040> fruit<00:01:29.549> trees<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:29.880> have<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.299> got<00:01:30.420> some

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
the fruit trees I have and I got some

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.149 
the fruit trees I have and I got some
goji<00:01:31.079> berries<00:01:31.350> from<00:01:31.470> China<00:01:31.770> right<00:01:32.400> here<00:01:34.159> these

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
goji berries from China right here these

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.969 
goji berries from China right here these
are<00:01:35.220> phenomenal<00:01:36.119> berries<00:01:36.829> probably<00:01:37.829> one<00:01:37.950> of

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
are phenomenal berries probably one of

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.940 
are phenomenal berries probably one of
the<00:01:38.100> highest<00:01:38.729> antioxidant<00:01:39.530> foods<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.829> the

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
the highest antioxidant foods in the

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.210 
the highest antioxidant foods in the
world<00:01:41.810> and<00:01:42.810> we're<00:01:42.960> putting<00:01:43.110> some<00:01:43.320> salt<00:01:43.560> ocean

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
world and we're putting some salt ocean

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.300 
world and we're putting some salt ocean
water<00:01:44.670> on<00:01:44.850> them<00:01:45.000> right<00:01:45.119> now<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:46.229> know<00:01:46.380> goji

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
water on them right now you know goji

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.260 
water on them right now you know goji
berries<00:01:47.579> about<00:01:47.729> themselves<00:01:48.030> are<00:01:48.149> real

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
berries about themselves are real

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.880 
berries about themselves are real
interesting<00:01:48.750> they<00:01:48.899> actually<00:01:49.229> are<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.470> complete

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
interesting they actually are a complete

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.920 
interesting they actually are a complete
protein<00:01:50.189> source<00:01:50.640> which<00:01:51.299> is<00:01:51.450> really<00:01:51.810> unusual

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
protein source which is really unusual

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.130 
protein source which is really unusual
for<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.560> berry<00:01:53.220> fruit<00:01:53.610> so<00:01:54.420> one<00:01:54.810> of<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.930> things<00:01:55.049> I

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
for a berry fruit so one of the things I

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.399 
for a berry fruit so one of the things I
found<00:01:55.290> really<00:01:55.530> interesting<00:01:55.710> with<00:01:56.070> them<00:01:57.409> yeah

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
found really interesting with them yeah

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.790 
found really interesting with them yeah
we'll<00:01:58.560> go<00:01:58.680> over<00:01:58.799> here<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:59.009> got<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.159> fig<00:01:59.430> tree

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.690 

it's<00:02:04.800> a<00:02:04.860> nice<00:02:05.040> little<00:02:05.220> tropical<00:02:05.700> tree<00:02:07.670> it's<00:02:08.670> a

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
it's a nice little tropical tree it's a

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.040 
it's a nice little tropical tree it's a
great<00:02:08.880> place<00:02:09.120> for<00:02:09.150> it<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.480> grow<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.840> flourish

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
great place for it to grow and flourish

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:18.460 
great place for it to grow and flourish
got<00:02:10.680> some<00:02:10.800> Chili<00:02:11.040> Peppers<00:02:11.150> avocados<00:02:13.490> oranges

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:25.010 

and<00:02:19.470> we<00:02:19.620> got<00:02:19.740> a<00:02:19.770> lemon<00:02:20.040> lee-moan<00:02:23.000> D'Amico<00:02:24.020> so

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
and we got a lemon lee-moan D'Amico so

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.780 
and we got a lemon lee-moan D'Amico so
this<00:02:25.260> is<00:02:25.380> a<00:02:25.410> real<00:02:25.650> good<00:02:25.770> strategy<00:02:26.280> if<00:02:26.490> you<00:02:26.610> have

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
this is a real good strategy if you have

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.850 
this is a real good strategy if you have
if<00:02:27.090> you<00:02:27.240> have<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.660> opportunity<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.380> go<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:28.680> the

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
if you have the opportunity to go to the

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.500 
if you have the opportunity to go to the
ocean<00:02:28.980> if<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:29.310> live<00:02:29.490> near<00:02:29.640> one<00:02:29.820> you<00:02:30.330> can<00:02:30.480> use

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
ocean if you live near one you can use

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.450 
ocean if you live near one you can use
it<00:02:30.720> in<00:02:30.780> your<00:02:30.810> home<00:02:31.020> garden<00:02:31.230> it's<00:02:31.620> phenomenal

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
it in your home garden it's phenomenal

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.520 
it in your home garden it's phenomenal
like<00:02:33.240> I<00:02:33.270> said<00:02:33.480> I've<00:02:33.660> been<00:02:33.690> doing<00:02:33.990> this<00:02:34.260> for<00:02:34.470> the

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
like I said I've been doing this for the

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.740 
like I said I've been doing this for the
last<00:02:34.620> few<00:02:34.890> months<00:02:35.220> it<00:02:35.700> goes<00:02:35.850> against<00:02:36.090> all<00:02:36.270> the

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
last few months it goes against all the

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.380 
last few months it goes against all the
research<00:02:37.170> that<00:02:37.530> says<00:02:37.740> not<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:38.160> do<00:02:38.280> it<00:02:38.460> and<00:02:38.940> it

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
research that says not to do it and it

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.540 
research that says not to do it and it
actually<00:02:39.570> works<00:02:39.930> really<00:02:40.110> well<00:02:40.350> so<00:02:41.220> there's<00:02:41.400> no

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
actually works really well so there's no

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.670 
actually works really well so there's no
sodium<00:02:41.880> issues<00:02:42.300> of<00:02:42.480> burnout<00:02:42.810> if<00:02:43.140> you<00:02:43.380> do<00:02:43.560> it

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
sodium issues of burnout if you do it

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.350 
sodium issues of burnout if you do it
properly<00:02:43.920> in<00:02:44.340> with<00:02:44.490> in<00:02:44.610> moderation<00:02:45.000> I

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
properly in with in moderation I

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.170 
properly in with in moderation I
probably<00:02:46.020> use<00:02:46.260> this<00:02:46.410> strategy<00:02:46.740> maybe<00:02:47.550> once<00:02:48.000> or

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
probably use this strategy maybe once or

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.030 
probably use this strategy maybe once or
twice<00:02:48.240> a<00:02:48.600> month<00:02:48.780> maybe<00:02:49.380> three<00:02:49.650> times<00:02:49.800> a<00:02:50.010> month

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
twice a month maybe three times a month

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.010 
twice a month maybe three times a month
just<00:02:50.400> depends<00:02:50.670> on<00:02:50.760> how<00:02:50.850> much<00:02:50.970> I<00:02:51.210> go<00:02:51.390> to<00:02:51.450> the

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
just depends on how much I go to the

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.960 
just depends on how much I go to the
beach<00:02:52.350> to<00:02:52.650> get<00:02:52.740> the<00:02:52.890> ocean<00:02:53.010> water<00:02:53.370> which<00:02:53.820> is<00:02:53.940> a

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
beach to get the ocean water which is a

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.760 
beach to get the ocean water which is a
great<00:02:54.330> way<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:54.510> get<00:02:54.780> outside<00:02:54.930> and<00:02:55.440> you<00:02:55.650> know

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
great way to get outside and you know

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.430 
great way to get outside and you know
use<00:02:56.370> nature's<00:02:56.790> power<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:57.360> bounty<00:02:57.750> to<00:02:58.020> kind<00:02:58.380> of

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
use nature's power and bounty to kind of

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.820 
use nature's power and bounty to kind of
fuel<00:02:58.710> your<00:02:58.890> garden<00:02:59.220> so<00:03:00.560> it's<00:03:01.560> a<00:03:01.650> little

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
fuel your garden so it's a little

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.380 
fuel your garden so it's a little
apropos<00:03:02.340> too<00:03:02.400> as<00:03:02.700> well<00:03:02.850> because<00:03:03.210> we're

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
apropos too as well because we're

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.880 
apropos too as well because we're
entering<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:03.810> Age<00:03:03.930> of<00:03:04.080> Aquarius<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.770> what

entering the Age of Aquarius and what

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.380 
entering the Age of Aquarius and what
better<00:03:05.100> way<00:03:05.280> but<00:03:05.490> took<00:03:05.610> bare<00:03:05.910> your<00:03:06.030> own<00:03:06.150> water

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
better way but took bare your own water

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.600 
better way but took bare your own water
on<00:03:06.570> your<00:03:06.660> shoulder<00:03:07.140> and<00:03:07.320> harvest<00:03:08.280> your<00:03:08.340> water

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
on your shoulder and harvest your water

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.850 
on your shoulder and harvest your water
