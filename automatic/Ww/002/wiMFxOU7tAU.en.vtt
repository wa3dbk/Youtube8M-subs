00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.669 

today<00:00:12.660> I'd<00:00:12.750> like<00:00:12.809> to<00:00:12.960> discuss<00:00:13.259> how<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.559> way

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
today I'd like to discuss how the way

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.169 
today I'd like to discuss how the way
that<00:00:13.830> atoms<00:00:14.130> are<00:00:14.250> arranged<00:00:14.490> in<00:00:14.610> a<00:00:14.670> solid<00:00:14.969> can

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
that atoms are arranged in a solid can

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.359 
that atoms are arranged in a solid can
change<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.480> behavior<00:00:15.839> of<00:00:15.900> that<00:00:16.080> solid<00:00:16.619> we'll

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
change the behavior of that solid we'll

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.529 
change the behavior of that solid we'll
start<00:00:17.580> by<00:00:17.670> doing<00:00:17.730> an<00:00:17.940> experiment<00:00:18.180> I'll<00:00:18.420> drop

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
start by doing an experiment I'll drop

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.939 
start by doing an experiment I'll drop
these<00:00:18.690> two<00:00:18.900> ball<00:00:19.050> bearings<00:00:19.380> down<00:00:19.560> these<00:00:19.650> tubes

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
these two ball bearings down these tubes

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.470 
these two ball bearings down these tubes
and<00:00:20.189> watch<00:00:20.400> them<00:00:20.609> bounce<00:00:20.760> off<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.240> metal

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
and watch them bounce off the metal

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.910 
and watch them bounce off the metal
plates<00:00:23.570> as<00:00:24.570> you<00:00:24.720> can<00:00:24.840> see<00:00:24.990> one<00:00:25.289> bounces<00:00:25.710> much

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
plates as you can see one bounces much

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:39.910 
plates as you can see one bounces much
longer<00:00:26.220> than<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.430> other

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.650 

so<00:00:40.920> what's<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.219> difference<00:00:41.420> both<00:00:42.420> ball

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
so what's the difference both ball

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.600 
so what's the difference both ball
bearings<00:00:42.960> are<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.170> same<00:00:43.410> but<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.190> bases<00:00:44.489> are

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
bearings are the same but the bases are

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.549 
bearings are the same but the bases are
different<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.750> base<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.110> made<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.379> stainless

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
different this base is made of stainless

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.319 
different this base is made of stainless
steel<00:00:46.739> while<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.519> is<00:00:47.670> stainless<00:00:47.969> steel<00:00:48.149> with
