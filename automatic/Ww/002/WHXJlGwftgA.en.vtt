and<00:02:01.060> see<00:02:01.240> how<00:02:01.450> it<00:02:01.630> behaves<00:02:01.810> sure<00:02:02.410> what<00:02:03.280> job

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
and see how it behaves sure what job

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.030 
and see how it behaves sure what job
shall<00:02:03.730> we<00:02:03.880> do<00:02:04.000> that<00:02:04.270> we<00:02:04.360> both<00:02:04.510> have<00:02:04.720> the<00:02:04.840> same

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
shall we do that we both have the same

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.800 
shall we do that we both have the same
education<00:02:06.040> I<00:02:06.400> do<00:02:06.580> I'm<00:02:06.970> gonna<00:02:07.090> pull<00:02:07.390> down<00:02:07.570> my

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
education I do I'm gonna pull down my

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.250 
education I do I'm gonna pull down my
search<00:02:08.670> with<00:02:09.670> spotlight<00:02:10.149> and<00:02:10.899> I<00:02:11.050> love

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
search with spotlight and I love

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.020 
search with spotlight and I love
education<00:02:11.440> so<00:02:12.129> much<00:02:12.190> that<00:02:12.519> I<00:02:12.580> actually<00:02:12.700> have

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
education so much that I actually have

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.030 
education so much that I actually have
it<00:02:13.120> on<00:02:13.210> my<00:02:13.360> toolbar<00:02:13.690> I've<00:02:14.620> had<00:02:14.800> a<00:02:14.830> lot<00:02:15.010> of

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
it on my toolbar I've had a lot of

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.500 
it on my toolbar I've had a lot of
teachers<00:02:15.310> ask<00:02:15.640> about

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
teachers ask about

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.869 
teachers ask about
can<00:02:16.810> they<00:02:17.260> with<00:02:17.620> an<00:02:17.769> interactive<00:02:18.010> device<00:02:18.519> like

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 
can they with an interactive device like

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.149 
can they with an interactive device like
a<00:02:18.909> mimeo<00:02:19.360> projector<00:02:19.959> can<00:02:20.200> they<00:02:20.409> control<00:02:20.980> the

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:21.159 
a mimeo projector can they control the

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:24.990 
a mimeo projector can they control the
iPad<00:02:21.670> from<00:02:22.060> their<00:02:22.360> board<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.549> answer<00:02:24.879> to

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
iPad from their board and the answer to

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.240 
iPad from their board and the answer to
that<00:02:25.090> is<00:02:25.269> no<00:02:25.450> you<00:02:25.780> only<00:02:26.200> control<00:02:26.590> your<00:02:26.920> iPad

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
that is no you only control your iPad

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.059 
that is no you only control your iPad
from<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.700> iPad<00:02:28.120> so<00:02:28.480> right<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:29.290> iPad<00:02:29.680> ends<00:02:29.980> up

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
from the iPad so right the iPad ends up

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.680 
from the iPad so right the iPad ends up
being<00:02:30.250> an<00:02:30.370> interactive<00:02:30.879> device<00:02:31.120> in<00:02:31.360> itself

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
being an interactive device in itself

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.500 
being an interactive device in itself
right<00:02:32.230> one<00:02:32.860> advantage<00:02:33.370> with<00:02:33.879> air<00:02:34.090> servers

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
right one advantage with air servers

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.330 
right one advantage with air servers
that<00:02:34.629> it's<00:02:34.810> just<00:02:35.019> a<00:02:35.140> little<00:02:35.349> bit<00:02:35.470> cheaper<00:02:35.950> less

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
that it's just a little bit cheaper less

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.970 
that it's just a little bit cheaper less
expensive<00:02:36.970> you<00:02:37.660> can<00:02:37.690> get<00:02:38.260> this<00:02:38.500> is<00:02:38.680> really

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
expensive you can get this is really

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.220 
expensive you can get this is really
messy<00:02:39.340> but<00:02:39.549> you<00:02:39.580> can<00:02:39.879> get<00:02:40.120> five<00:02:40.450> reflector

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
messy but you can get five reflector

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.140 
messy but you can get five reflector
license<00:02:41.620> for<00:02:41.769> fifty<00:02:42.160> dollars<00:02:42.489> well<00:02:42.940> so<00:02:43.060> you

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
license for fifty dollars well so you

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.619 
license for fifty dollars well so you
can<00:02:43.329> do<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:43.599> grouping<00:02:44.049> with<00:02:44.260> reflector<00:02:44.829> okay

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
can do the grouping with reflector okay

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:50.369 
can do the grouping with reflector okay
another<00:02:46.629> thing<00:02:46.750> is<00:02:47.230> as<00:02:47.530> far<00:02:47.769> as<00:02:49.049> the<00:02:50.049> device

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:50.379 
another thing is as far as the device

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:52.350 
another thing is as far as the device
that<00:02:50.560> you<00:02:50.709> have<00:02:50.799> to<00:02:50.920> run<00:02:51.099> it<00:02:51.280> on<00:02:51.430> this<00:02:52.000> I<00:02:52.239> know

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
that you have to run it on this I know

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.410 
that you have to run it on this I know
is<00:02:52.720> ten<00:02:53.019> point<00:02:53.260> six<00:02:53.470> or<00:02:53.650> higher<00:02:53.860> uh<00:02:54.190> or<00:02:55.180> as<00:02:55.299> I

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
is ten point six or higher uh or as I

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.259 
is ten point six or higher uh or as I
think<00:02:55.480> reflector<00:02:56.170> has<00:02:56.379> to<00:02:56.560> be<00:02:56.680> a<00:02:56.709> little<00:02:56.920> bit

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
think reflector has to be a little bit

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.059 
think reflector has to be a little bit
higher<00:02:58.269> version<00:02:58.750> ten<00:02:58.900> point<00:02:59.140> eight<00:02:59.319> template

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
eight for a reflector okay and we have

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.470 
eight for a reflector okay and we have
that<00:03:02.769> all<00:03:02.890> on<00:03:03.129> the<00:03:03.340> spec<00:03:03.609> sheet<00:03:03.910> there<00:03:04.239> where

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
that all on the spec sheet there where

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.030 
that all on the spec sheet there where
it<00:03:04.569> compares<00:03:04.720> because<00:03:05.560> another<00:03:05.799> way<00:03:05.980> to

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
it compares because another way to

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.270 
it compares because another way to

doctors almost forty five now and one
thing<00:03:18.849> I<00:03:18.940> think<00:03:19.000> we<00:03:19.209> should<00:03:19.390> point<00:03:19.540> out<00:03:19.720> as<00:03:19.870> far

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
thing I think we should point out as far

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.240 
thing I think we should point out as far
as<00:03:20.079> both<00:03:20.260> of<00:03:20.470> these<00:03:20.620> also<00:03:20.889> is<00:03:21.310> it's<00:03:22.000> not<00:03:22.269> an<00:03:22.660> app

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
as both of these also is it's not an app

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.890 
as both of these also is it's not an app
right<00:03:24.250> they're<00:03:24.819> both<00:03:25.000> called<00:03:25.269> like<00:03:25.750> the

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
right they're both called like the

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.890 
right they're both called like the
reflector<00:03:26.440> mm-hmm<00:03:27.250> but<00:03:27.639> it's<00:03:28.269> actually<00:03:28.870> a

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
reflector mm-hmm but it's actually a

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.690 
reflector mm-hmm but it's actually a

other than that they do almost the exact

other than that they do almost the exact
same<00:03:34.660> thing<00:03:34.870> it's<00:03:35.349> just<00:03:35.440> whichever<00:03:35.980> one

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
buy for yourself you had to pick or you

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:46.620 
buy for yourself you had to pick or you
got<00:03:43.569> to<00:03:43.599> pick<00:03:43.930> what<00:03:44.680> would<00:03:44.829> you<00:03:44.980> pick<00:03:45.630> well

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
got to pick what would you pick well

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:47.940 
got to pick what would you pick well
right<00:03:46.870> now<00:03:47.019> I'm<00:03:47.139> really<00:03:47.319> struggling<00:03:47.739> with

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
right now I'm really struggling with

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.759 
right now I'm really struggling with
reflector<00:03:48.700> connecting<00:03:49.419> so<00:03:49.810> I<00:03:50.049> think<00:03:50.139> I<00:03:50.620> would

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
reflector connecting so I think I would

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.039 
reflector connecting so I think I would
probably<00:03:51.069> try<00:03:51.579> airserver<00:03:52.120> how<00:03:52.450> about<00:03:52.630> you<00:03:52.810> I

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
probably try airserver how about you I
