 Hello such friends and you how they are 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.119
 welcome to talk about the day in this house 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.890
 We are going to show you a pretty game 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.320
 interesting that is completely 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.390
 free in the span and good for those who 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.009
 they do not know what the app of the day is 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.470
 this kind of videos that we upload 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.939
 when we find a good application 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.500
 completely free in the lapse since 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.540
 many people do not always check the 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.580
 app are and are lost from many games or 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.080
 applications that are free one single 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.420
 day so we're going to show you a game 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.580
 quite interesting so more and more 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.290
 we started and here we have the game of 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.760
 captain america that looks pretty good 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.900
 so let's apply here where it says 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.590
 to play 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.480
 and well let's play here the 2 has 96 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.500
 missions about that is 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.480
 pretty good since it's a game 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.910
 pretty complete let's apply here 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.860
 quickly to 2 and we give you next 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.750
 here as you can appreciate you can change 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.150
 of soldiers and all that but I'm going to 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.130
 leave as is and here we have the 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.380
 objectives as you can appreciate that it is 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.720
 rescue all defeated civilians 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.430
 the enemies and do not use the technique of your 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.670
 suit let's apply here where it says 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.670
 place 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.740
 and here we have it already and something that I like 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.170
 a lot this Thursday that looks like this 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.160
 comic book or like cartoon and vale 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.620
 really worth 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.440
 here we have say a soldier to me 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.780
 side that if it stung you here 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.110
 and it stung any enemy he shoots 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.110
 for me 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.430
 and good 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.430
 with this we just fight 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.110
 let's move forward and well we can also 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.440
 throw the disc 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:56.280
 there we are going to say that we can give a 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.979
 more time here 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.650
 well I'm pretty bad well too 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.860
 have different things we also have 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.840
 that see the life of our soldier of 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.220
 our friend so they do not kill him we're going 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.290
 to move through here and we have this power 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.240
 and something I like is that they come out like this 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.150
 like the comics that says even if 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.769
 all that 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.769
 that makes it more fun 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.189
 there you can find it with the let's say 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:28.189
 Connection 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.360
 and well let's go here I have a shot 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.270
 let's use it graphically 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.920
 we sting here we sting an enemy and 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:43.140
 shoot for us 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.140
 we use the costume technique here 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:51.110
 we already have there let's say that he fell what 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.420
 that is the people and our friend so 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.670
 let's help him quickly 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:00.040
 of we prick here where is that symbol 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.040
 that we have four and obviously there will be 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.180
 I'm pretty good at the game 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:17.620
 today we have much more life let's say 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.620
 we went there until 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.650
 It's good because they help us 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.800
 those agents help us a lot 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.320
 and here we can also launch that is 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.530
 I do not know if we can do it, I'm pretty 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:37.260
 bad with chili since you have to 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.270
 let's say you're good to throw it 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.170
 without problems here we are going to upload 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.170
 quickly over here 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.580
 and here we use the power 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.360
 obviously this is the second part is 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.850
 pretty simple but obviously 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.860
 as we go by, it goes on doing 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.960
 much more complicated 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.220
 and how can they appear here we pass the 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.260
 mission 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.240
 and they give us all the score obviously 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.760
 I did not do everything because I used the technique 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:11.150
 of the costume to show how the 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.190
 powers of the captain america we can 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.620
 give here the points from the 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.480
 time that we took and obviously 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.250
 as agents move up 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.989
 we can also buy many more 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.060
 agents to make it much more fun 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.470
 this game so nothing my friends
