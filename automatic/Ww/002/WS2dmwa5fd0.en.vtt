00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
to maneuver the ball and this is a

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.389 
to maneuver the ball and this is a
classic<00:00:44.820> example<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.410> batsman<00:00:46.800> faced<00:00:47.190> with

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
a lot of spin really not sure where to

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.000 
a lot of spin really not sure where to
go<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.940> then<00:00:51.210> as<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.140> room<00:00:52.289> rate<00:00:52.500> increased

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
go and then as the room rate increased

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.040 
go and then as the room rate increased
there<00:00:53.699> was<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.850> little<00:00:53.969> bit<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.270> clinic<00:00:54.600> setting

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
there was a little bit of clinic setting

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.010 
there was a little bit of clinic setting
there<00:00:55.260> are<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.379> few<00:00:56.480> notes<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.780> kind<00:00:57.989> of

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
there are a few notes and that kind of

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.660 
there are a few notes and that kind of
thing<00:00:58.379> but<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.680> was<00:00:58.770> all<00:00:58.949> down<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.430> fact

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
thing but it was all down to the fact

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.130 
thing but it was all down to the fact
that<00:00:59.760> that<00:00:59.940> run<00:01:00.180> rate<00:01:00.390> continued<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:00.989> increase

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
that that run rate continued to increase

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.410 
that that run rate continued to increase
and<00:01:02.129> it's<00:01:02.250> very<00:01:02.489> very<00:01:02.730> difficult<00:01:02.940> when<00:01:03.270> you're

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
and it's very very difficult when you're

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.759 
and it's very very difficult when you're
first<00:01:03.539> coming<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:04.080> at<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.260> ball<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.619> spinning

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
and let's face it lead boys ball where

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.170 
and let's face it lead boys ball where
the<00:01:07.229> ball<00:01:07.920> spin<00:01:08.280> they're<00:01:08.610> presented<00:01:09.150> with

yeah<00:04:24.000> he<00:04:24.150> was<00:04:24.300> basically<00:04:25.610> airborne<00:04:26.610> when<00:04:26.819> he

00:04:26.869 --> 00:04:26.879 
yeah he was basically airborne when he

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:29.480 
yeah he was basically airborne when he
took<00:04:27.030> off<00:04:27.569> but<00:04:28.470> if<00:04:28.590> some<00:04:28.770> sums<00:04:29.039> up<00:04:29.190> in<00:04:29.310> many

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
took off but if some sums up in many
