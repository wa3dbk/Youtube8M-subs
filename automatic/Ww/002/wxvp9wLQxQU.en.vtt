00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:10.040
 hello everyone came to this is a new one 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:13.550
 video and I searched google on 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.400
 everywhere youtube tried to beat 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.630
 the penalty kicks ended over 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.140
 match and also extra time 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.179
 but I found only those who for 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.399
 example I'm playing I'm in the area 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:28.699
 opponent did not slip foul years ago 

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:31.039
 and it is that rigor of is different from the rigors 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.440
 after a game because he lost 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:36.320
 2011 I think I know for sure that I do 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.800
 be wary with the playstation 3 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.290
 and then I didn't find it from anybody 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:47.020
 part then I kept trying e 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:50.829
 try again and i figured out how to do it and i have 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:53.500
 discovered type 1 is said half a month ago 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:58.550
 now with my friend we decided to 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:02.180
 try to make the goalkeeper on video 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.650
 player two will not move because the 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.840
 my friend is holding the car 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.030
 photographic and we had no one else 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.530
 but the important thing is to know how to do it 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.689
 I will show you a rigor that will frame you 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.579
 the joystick so you will see how to make a 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:18.590
 rigor that you will see how it happens 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:22.609
 effect 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:26.719
 sometimes later you will see how it moves 

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:28.579
 first the lever on the right the shot will come 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:30.740
 right sometimes it will come to the left 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:32.899
 I don't know why sometimes it doesn't even come 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.740
 is central or throws it away 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:39.049
 I don't know why but sometimes it does so if 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.900
 come post don't think you were wrong 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.380
 it can happen 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:47.020
 as it happens three or four times me 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.420
 will have happened since I know how to do them 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:53.080
 make the post 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.270
 but in short it is better to do type 2 goals and 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.540
 three wrong rather than all 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.940
 central hope that you can throw the power 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.100
 then I will also show you how to throw there 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.470
 because in the booklet I think there is 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.040
 written or is also found on 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.990
 internet however for there is for safety in the 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.680
 in case he wanted to be there to look also 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:18.640
 how to jump with the goalkeeper I will add it 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:23.070
 I will show you how to do good 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.070
 we can start penalty kicks 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:34.720
 then here they start a moment 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:36.130
 I also confirm the door for my friend 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.990
 the players now not only brings 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.990
 ordinary it does so 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:48.940
 I'll show you this way and so ok 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.390
 now a moment that I do pull in 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.390
 single 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:02.209
 I'll do another one after I'll do it after 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.790
 my friend will have here I made central in 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.739
 every minute though the same can be done 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.650
 also happen to score the goalkeeper 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:17.390
 the central shot is central 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:21.099
 if I am a banker now throwing myself a friend 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:23.930
 tip from here is the result 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:26.329
 I have yet to figure out how to pull it up 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:30.530
 now I will show you how to throw yourself 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:34.750
 the goalkeeper, on the other hand , has fine theses 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:40.340
 because moving to move the summit moves 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:41.720
 I make a great shot here I am 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.060
 wrong in place that the background 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:48.409
 central if I show you the porter 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:50.569
 how do you get it thrown away you need night 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:53.659
 I have to do this 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:55.010
 if you want it to jump to the left 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:56.450
 made like that 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.099
 if you have to the right do so 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.750
 pressing square and moment the lever 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:03.859
 ok 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:08.590
 the video closes here thanks 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:08.590
