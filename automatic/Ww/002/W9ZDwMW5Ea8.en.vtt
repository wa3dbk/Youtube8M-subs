imagine see how my thumb's all right I'm
not<00:02:55.220> going<00:02:55.400> like<00:02:55.519> this<00:02:55.790> I'm<00:02:56.120> going<00:02:56.480> like<00:02:56.720> this

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
not going like this I'm going like this

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.960 
not going like this I'm going like this
coming<00:02:58.130> to<00:02:58.310> my<00:02:58.459> thumbs

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
coming to my thumbs

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.150 
coming to my thumbs
the<00:02:59.060> thumbs<00:02:59.300> are<00:02:59.390> coming<00:02:59.660> together<00:02:59.920> so<00:03:00.920> that's

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
the thumbs are coming together so that's

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.970 
the thumbs are coming together so that's
how<00:03:01.250> you<00:03:01.310> do<00:03:01.489> it<00:03:01.989> so<00:03:02.989> you<00:03:03.019> do<00:03:03.230> that<00:03:03.380> and<00:03:03.620> also

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
how you do it so you do that and also

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.150 
how you do it so you do that and also
you<00:03:04.580> get<00:03:04.700> package<00:03:05.060> B<00:03:05.300> right<00:03:06.230> here

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
you get package B right here

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.910 
you get package B right here
and<00:03:08.250> if<00:03:09.120> they<00:03:09.330> have<00:03:09.450> been<00:03:09.660> going<00:03:10.260> straight<00:03:10.590> run

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
and if they have been going straight run

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.410 
and if they have been going straight run
tilt<00:03:11.250> it<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.490> the<00:03:11.520> side<00:03:11.640> just<00:03:11.940> a<00:03:12.060> little<00:03:12.090> bit

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
tilt it to the side just a little bit

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.660 
tilt it to the side just a little bit
all<00:03:13.410> right

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
all right

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.210 
all right
so<00:03:15.420> you<00:03:16.110> touch<00:03:16.319> it<00:03:16.470> to<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.680> side<00:03:16.890> just<00:03:17.069> a

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
so you touch it to the side just a

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.880 
so you touch it to the side just a
little<00:03:17.250> bit<00:03:17.990> and<00:03:18.990> you<00:03:19.140> move<00:03:20.900> red<00:03:21.900> sugar<00:03:22.170> the

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
little bit and you move red sugar the

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.559 
little bit and you move red sugar the
edges<00:03:23.220> are<00:03:23.340> connected<00:03:23.819> and<00:03:25.370> you<00:03:26.370> move<00:03:27.360> it<00:03:27.540> back

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
edges are connected and you move it back

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.690 
edges are connected and you move it back
and<00:03:27.959> forth<00:03:28.050> and<00:03:28.470> with<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.310> index<00:03:29.640> finger

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
and forth and with the index finger

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.030 
and forth and with the index finger
you're<00:03:30.150> putting<00:03:30.450> pressure<00:03:30.660> to<00:03:30.959> it<00:03:31.050> okay

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
you're putting pressure to it okay

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.790 
you're putting pressure to it okay
making<00:03:33.030> that<00:03:34.340> you'll<00:03:35.340> get<00:03:35.550> a<00:03:35.610> nice<00:03:35.880> even

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
making that you'll get a nice even
