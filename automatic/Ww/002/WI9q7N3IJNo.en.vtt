kinds of beings reflectors I think one

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.600 
kinds of beings reflectors I think one
of<00:00:23.080> the<00:00:23.230> things<00:00:23.500> that<00:00:23.770> most<00:00:23.920> reflectors

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:24.610 
of the things that most reflectors

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.179 
of the things that most reflectors
really<00:00:25.000> don't<00:00:25.210> grasp<00:00:25.480> is<00:00:25.810> how<00:00:25.990> profound<00:00:26.770> their

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:27.189 
really don't grasp is how profound their

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.040 
really don't grasp is how profound their
relationship<00:00:27.850> deeply<00:00:28.390> profound<00:00:28.630> their

relationship deeply profound their

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.060 
relationship deeply profound their
relationship<00:00:29.680> is<00:00:29.859> to<00:00:30.100> the<00:00:30.130> moon<00:00:30.430> itself<00:00:32.070> you

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
relationship is to the moon itself you

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.979 
relationship is to the moon itself you
know<00:00:33.190> I've<00:00:33.250> asked<00:00:33.640> so<00:00:33.760> many<00:00:34.000> times<00:00:34.390> by

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:34.989 
know I've asked so many times by

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:37.259 
know I've asked so many times by
reflectors<00:00:35.890> well<00:00:36.129> when<00:00:36.309> does<00:00:36.580> the<00:00:36.820> lunar

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
and ends with the decision-making

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.840 
and ends with the decision-making
process<00:00:48.449> at<00:00:49.449> the<00:00:50.320> moment<00:00:50.350> that<00:00:50.830> any<00:00:50.979> reflector

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
reflector something that's going to

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.039 
reflector something that's going to
demand<00:00:59.019> a<00:00:59.559> decision<00:01:00.159> in<00:01:00.460> regards<00:01:01.030> to<00:01:01.119> this<00:01:01.690> and

demand a decision in regards to this and

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:05.969 
demand a decision in regards to this and
that<00:01:02.970> that<00:01:03.970> it's<00:01:04.150> then<00:01:04.479> at<00:01:04.809> that<00:01:04.960> moment<00:01:05.019> that

have their true Authority and to make
decisions<00:01:24.310> as<00:01:24.550> themselves<00:01:25.950> what's<00:01:26.950> so

decisions as themselves what's so
fascinating<00:01:27.280> to<00:01:27.940> me<00:01:27.970> about<00:01:28.230> the<00:01:29.230> existence<00:01:30.040> of

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
fascinating to me about the existence of

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.630 
fascinating to me about the existence of
reflectors<00:01:31.030> in<00:01:31.360> our<00:01:31.510> plane<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.890> that<00:01:33.160> they<00:01:33.460> are

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
reflectors in our plane is that they are

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.600 
reflectors in our plane is that they are
the<00:01:33.850> only<00:01:34.030> ones<00:01:34.540> that<00:01:34.840> truly<00:01:35.140> can<00:01:35.560> tell<00:01:35.890> who's

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
the only ones that truly can tell who's

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.890 
the only ones that truly can tell who's
in<00:01:36.940> and<00:01:37.300> out<00:01:37.930> of<00:01:38.380> the<00:01:38.890> program<00:01:39.510> that<00:01:40.510> is<00:01:40.630> really

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
in and out of the program that is really

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.710 
in and out of the program that is really
quite<00:01:41.050> something<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:42.940> reflector<00:01:43.510> is

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
quite something that the reflector is

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.350 
quite something that the reflector is
the<00:01:43.900> only<00:01:44.080> being<00:01:44.440> that<00:01:44.680> can<00:01:44.860> recognize<00:01:45.360> those

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
the only being that can recognize those

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.050 
the only being that can recognize those
that<00:01:46.780> don't<00:01:47.080> fit<00:01:47.500> in<00:01:47.770> to<00:01:48.190> the<00:01:48.340> program<00:01:48.580> like
