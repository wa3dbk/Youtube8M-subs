00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
to make sure that they get just enough

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.039 
to make sure that they get just enough
reps<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:11.280> be<00:01:11.430> fresh<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.750> they<00:01:12.869> can

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
reps in to be fresh so that they can

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.990 
reps in to be fresh so that they can
continue<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.920> press<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.400> weight<00:01:14.670> overhead

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
pushed jerking that so he didn't really

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.090 
pushed jerking that so he didn't really
have<00:01:52.720> to<00:01:52.840> split<00:01:53.110> underneath<00:01:53.530> it<00:01:53.680> Marco

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
have to split underneath it Marco

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.280 
have to split underneath it Marco
Coppola<00:01:54.550> watch<00:01:55.120> him<00:01:55.390> just<00:01:55.570> push<00:01:55.870> jerk<00:01:56.110> this

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290

quarterfinal match I talked about they

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.530 
quarterfinal match I talked about they

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
said they were able to do that because

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.350 
said they were able to do that because
of<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.780> match

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
from my Indians there and already the

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.080 
from my Indians there and already the
quadrant<00:02:23.900> number<00:02:23.930> four<00:02:24.470> and<00:02:24.830> DC<00:02:25.490> still<00:02:25.880> in

quadrant number four and DC still in
quadrant<00:02:26.690> number<00:02:26.720> three<00:02:27.400> we<00:02:28.400> talked<00:02:28.730> about

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
quadrant number three we talked about

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.030 
quadrant number three we talked about
Nikki<00:02:29.390> rancor<00:02:29.810> we<00:02:29.960> talked<00:02:30.230> about<00:02:30.440> Warren

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
Nikki rancor we talked about Warren

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.190 
Nikki rancor we talked about Warren
Brooks<00:02:31.400> for<00:02:31.880> Miami<00:02:32.360> they<00:02:32.660> are<00:02:32.780> now<00:02:32.990> in

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
Brooks for Miami they are now in

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.630 
Brooks for Miami they are now in
quadrant<00:02:33.620> four<00:02:33.680> and<00:02:34.070> it<00:02:34.160> looks<00:02:34.340> like<00:02:34.400> they're

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
quadrant four and it looks like they're

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.460 
quadrant four and it looks like they're
going<00:02:34.760> to<00:02:34.880> go<00:02:34.970> unbroken<00:02:35.330> on<00:02:35.690> these<00:02:35.870> ten<00:02:36.110> jerks

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
going to go unbroken on these ten jerks

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.440 
going to go unbroken on these ten jerks
in<00:02:36.620> that<00:02:36.800> quadrant<00:02:37.040> if<00:02:37.640> they<00:02:37.850> don't<00:02:38.060> have<00:02:38.240> to

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
in that quadrant if they don't have to

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.750 
in that quadrant if they don't have to
substitute<00:02:38.780> out<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:39.440> they<00:02:39.560> can<00:02:39.740> continue<00:02:40.190> to

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
substitute out and they can continue to

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:48.760 
substitute out and they can continue to
jerk<00:02:40.970> this<00:02:41.120> weight<00:02:41.330> overhead<00:02:41.600> they're<00:02:42.230> done

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.070 

so<00:02:49.770> it's<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.130> surge<00:02:50.490> that<00:02:50.910> answer<00:02:51.480> back<00:02:51.750> and

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
so it's the surge that answer back and

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:59.900 
so it's the surge that answer back and
pick<00:02:52.320> up<00:02:52.500> two<00:02:52.800> points<00:02:53.160> in<00:02:53.490> mirror<00:02:58.580> but<00:02:59.580> what

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
pick up two points in mirror but what

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.000 
pick up two points in mirror but what
was<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.270> difference<00:03:00.480> there<00:03:00.960> why<00:03:01.290> are<00:03:01.770> they<00:03:01.950> so

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
was the difference there why are they so

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.160 
was the difference there why are they so
fast<00:03:02.610> to<00:03:02.820> the<00:03:02.940> fork<00:03:03.180> ball<00:03:03.360> it<00:03:03.390> looked<00:03:03.780> like

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
fast to the fork ball it looked like

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.830 
fast to the fork ball it looked like
Todd<00:03:04.680> it<00:03:04.890> looked<00:03:05.190> like<00:03:05.370> DC<00:03:05.940> just<00:03:06.240> slowed<00:03:06.600> down

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
Todd it looked like DC just slowed down

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.160 
Todd it looked like DC just slowed down
in<00:03:06.900> Quadrant<00:03:07.320> three
