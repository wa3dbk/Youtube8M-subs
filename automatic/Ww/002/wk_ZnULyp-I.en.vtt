00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
and what you have to do is to match the

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.860 
and what you have to do is to match the
pizzas<00:02:01.220> on<00:02:01.430> top<00:02:01.700> by<00:02:01.909> building<00:02:02.300> the<00:02:02.390> ones<00:02:02.630> at

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
pizzas on top by building the ones at

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.710 
pizzas on top by building the ones at
the<00:02:02.930> bottom<00:02:03.140> with<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:03.620> ingredients<00:02:03.860> are

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
the bottom with the ingredients are

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.770 
the bottom with the ingredients are
running<00:02:05.720> by<00:02:05.840> on<00:02:06.200> the<00:02:06.440> conveyor<00:02:06.770> belt

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
running by on the conveyor belt

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.499 
running by on the conveyor belt
it's<00:02:08.410> not<00:02:08.950> as<00:02:09.220> easy<00:02:09.429> as<00:02:09.610> it<00:02:09.910> looks<00:02:10.209> because

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
it's not as easy as it looks because

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.690 
it's not as easy as it looks because
that<00:02:10.780> that<00:02:11.200> belt<00:02:11.440> actually<00:02:12.040> goes<00:02:12.220> a<00:02:12.490> lot

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
that that belt actually goes a lot

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.940 
that that belt actually goes a lot
faster<00:02:12.940> than<00:02:13.330> you<00:02:13.510> think<00:02:13.540> so<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:14.709> the

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
faster than you think so and the

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.610 
faster than you think so and the
ingredient<00:02:15.819> that<00:02:15.900> ingredients<00:02:16.900> do<00:02:17.230> run<00:02:17.440> out

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
ingredient that ingredients do run out

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.240 
ingredient that ingredients do run out
so<00:02:18.069> if<00:02:18.310> you<00:02:18.490> run<00:02:19.300> out<00:02:19.569> of<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:20.650> components<00:02:21.190> you

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
so if you run out of the components you

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.970 
so if you run out of the components you
need<00:02:21.310> to<00:02:21.550> build<00:02:21.730> pizza<00:02:22.300> you<00:02:22.930> basically<00:02:23.380> lose
