hello YouTube it's now time for another

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.590 
hello YouTube it's now time for another
project<00:00:04.470> and<00:00:04.980> this<00:00:05.310> time<00:00:05.640> I've<00:00:05.940> been<00:00:05.970> working

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
project and this time I've been working

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.089 
project and this time I've been working
with<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:07.370> XV<00:00:08.389> 11<00:00:09.389> lidar<00:00:09.960> sensor<00:00:10.650> this<00:00:10.860> is<00:00:10.920> a

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
with the XV 11 lidar sensor this is a

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.090 
with the XV 11 lidar sensor this is a
laser<00:00:12.000> rangefinder<00:00:12.719> I<00:00:13.349> found<00:00:14.070> on<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.639> NATO

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.100 
laser rangefinder I found on a NATO

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.599 
laser rangefinder I found on a NATO
vacuum<00:00:17.100> robot<00:00:17.789> vacuum<00:00:18.480> cleaner<00:00:19.310> this<00:00:20.310> is<00:00:20.430> one

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
vacuum robot vacuum cleaner this is one

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.970 
vacuum robot vacuum cleaner this is one
of<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.850> more<00:00:21.240> inexpensive<00:00:21.660> modules<00:00:22.529> compared

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
of the more inexpensive modules compared

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.179 
of the more inexpensive modules compared
to<00:00:23.189> normal<00:00:24.029> lighters<00:00:24.539> which<00:00:24.900> easily<00:00:25.410> comes<00:00:25.830> as

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
to normal lighters which easily comes as

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.240 
to normal lighters which easily comes as
four<00:00:26.519> hundred<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.199> thousand<00:00:28.199> dollars<00:00:28.560> but

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
four hundred and thousand dollars but

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.700 
four hundred and thousand dollars but
the<00:00:29.580> this<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.269> cheaper<00:00:30.929> module<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.500> get

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
the this is a cheaper module to get

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.680 
the this is a cheaper module to get
hands<00:00:31.980> on<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:33.000> great<00:00:33.180> thing<00:00:33.360> about<00:00:33.390> this

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
hands on the great thing about this

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.840 
hands on the great thing about this
module<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.260> it's<00:00:34.590> powered<00:00:35.040> by<00:00:35.070> about

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
module is that it's powered by about

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.260 
module is that it's powered by about
five<00:00:36.120> volt<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:37.219> it<00:00:38.809> just<00:00:39.809> uses<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.440> standard

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
five volt and it just uses a standard

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.860 
five volt and it just uses a standard
you<00:00:42.270> are<00:00:42.450> connection<00:00:43.079> with<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.829> 11<00:00:44.660> 5200<00:00:45.660> bow

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
you are connection with the 11 5200 bow

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.979 
you are connection with the 11 5200 bow
so<00:00:46.680> that's<00:00:46.920> perfect<00:00:47.239> though<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.539> spits<00:00:48.840> out

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
so that's perfect though it spits out

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.670 
so that's perfect though it spits out
quite<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.649> lot<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:50.100> data<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.700> be<00:00:50.850> processed<00:00:51.090> so

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
quite a lot of data to be processed so

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.020 
quite a lot of data to be processed so
for<00:00:52.680> this<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:53.039> decided<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.730> use<00:00:53.969> an<00:00:54.239> STM<00:00:55.170> 32<00:00:56.030> this

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
for this I decided to use an STM 32 this

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.920 
for this I decided to use an STM 32 this
is<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.420> stm32<00:00:58.460> 429<00:00:59.460> discovery<00:01:00.030> board<00:01:00.239> which

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
is the stm32 429 discovery board which

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.049 
is the stm32 429 discovery board which
has<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.320> process<00:01:01.800> on<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.070> back<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.609> some

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
has the process on the back and some

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.570 
has the process on the back and some
SDRAM<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.080> then<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:05.299> touch<00:01:06.299> display<00:01:07.460> for<00:01:08.460> this

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
SDRAM and then a touch display for this

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.410 
SDRAM and then a touch display for this
project<00:01:08.850> I've<00:01:09.240> actually<00:01:09.450> decided<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.170> make<00:01:10.470> it

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
project I've actually decided to make it

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.560 
project I've actually decided to make it
Wireless<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.830> scans<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:14.850> battery

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
Wireless so it scans and it is battery

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.080 
Wireless so it scans and it is battery
driven<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.530> also<00:01:16.740> put<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.430> Bluetooth<00:01:17.880> module

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
driven and I also put a Bluetooth module

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.170 
driven and I also put a Bluetooth module
on<00:01:18.420> here<00:01:18.689> so<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.350> can<00:01:19.650> send<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.430> data<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.880> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
on here so I can send the data to the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.410 
on here so I can send the data to the
computer<00:01:21.470> to<00:01:22.470> display<00:01:23.159> but<00:01:23.909> I've<00:01:24.150> also

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
computer to display but I've also

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.740 
computer to display but I've also
implemented<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.439> display<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.490> range<00:01:26.759> the

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
implemented the display of the range the

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.890 
implemented the display of the range the
distances<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.470> are<00:01:29.299> coming<00:01:30.299> back<00:01:30.450> from<00:01:30.720> the

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
distances that are coming back from the

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.749 
distances that are coming back from the
sensor<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.320> be<00:01:31.590> displayed<00:01:32.009> on<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.250> actual

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
sensor to be displayed on the actual

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.810 
sensor to be displayed on the actual
display<00:01:33.479> here<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:34.530> let's<00:01:35.040> have<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.220> look<00:01:35.369> at<00:01:35.549> the

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
display here so let's have a look at the

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.490 
display here so let's have a look at the
project<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.509> action<00:01:38.869> the<00:01:39.869> first<00:01:40.049> thing<00:01:40.350> we

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
project in action the first thing we

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.830 
project in action the first thing we
have<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.680> do<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.909> connect<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.540> battery

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
have to do is to connect the battery

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.450 
have to do is to connect the battery
lead<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.430> stm32<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.649> as<00:01:46.649> we<00:01:46.860> do<00:01:47.040> so<00:01:47.250> we

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
lead to the stm32 and as we do so we

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.120 
lead to the stm32 and as we do so we
will<00:01:48.180> see<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.750> lighter<00:01:49.130> starts

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
will see that the lighter starts

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.690 
will see that the lighter starts
spinning<00:01:51.950> now<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.310> lighter<00:01:53.490> is

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
spinning now that the lighter is

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.880 
spinning now that the lighter is
spinning<00:01:54.060> we<00:01:54.780> will<00:01:54.960> also<00:01:55.079> see<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.439> on<00:01:55.770> the

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
spinning we will also see that on the

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.060 
spinning we will also see that on the
display<00:01:56.450> whoops<00:01:57.450> we<00:01:57.869> actually<00:01:58.290> have<00:01:58.560> the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
display whoops we actually have the

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.569 
display whoops we actually have the
lidar<00:01:59.520> information<00:02:00.509> shown<00:02:00.920> so<00:02:01.920> if<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.219> turn<00:02:02.280> it

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
lidar information shown so if I turn it

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.510 
lidar information shown so if I turn it
like<00:02:02.700> this<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.719> will<00:02:03.869> correspond<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.860> the

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
like this it will correspond to the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.199 
like this it will correspond to the
actual<00:02:05.729> lidar<00:02:06.270> data<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:07.520> can<00:02:08.520> then<00:02:09.709> move<00:02:10.709> around

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
actual lidar data I can then move around

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.550 
actual lidar data I can then move around
and<00:02:12.209> we<00:02:12.300> will<00:02:12.420> see<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.900> room

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
and we will see the room

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:21.199 
and we will see the room
being<00:02:14.280> scanned<00:02:19.190> so<00:02:20.190> I<00:02:20.220> move<00:02:20.430> into<00:02:20.640> a<00:02:20.850> more

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
being scanned so I move into a more

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.870 
being scanned so I move into a more
dagger<00:02:21.569> room<00:02:21.920> we'll<00:02:22.920> still<00:02:23.250> see<00:02:23.520> that<00:02:23.700> the

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
dagger room we'll still see that the

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:34.690 
dagger room we'll still see that the
lighter<00:02:24.350> catches<00:02:25.490> the<00:02:26.540> room<00:02:27.540> quite<00:02:28.350> well<00:02:30.860> and

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.220 

back<00:02:35.700> at<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:35.970> computer<00:02:36.150> we<00:02:36.600> can<00:02:36.750> then<00:02:36.870> try

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
back at the computer we can then try

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.770 
back at the computer we can then try
instead<00:02:37.800> of<00:02:38.010> showing<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.819> data<00:02:39.390> on<00:02:39.660> the

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
instead of showing the data on the

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.390 
instead of showing the data on the
screen<00:02:39.980> we<00:02:40.980> can<00:02:41.220> try<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:42.590> start<00:02:43.590> our<00:02:43.770> MATLAB

this<00:02:48.320> to<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:49.440> Bluetooth<00:02:49.769> module<00:02:49.950> on<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.940> back

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
this to the Bluetooth module on the back

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.390 
this to the Bluetooth module on the back
you'll<00:02:52.110> see<00:02:52.380> that<00:02:52.790> this<00:02:53.790> module<00:02:54.360> will<00:02:55.400> will

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
you'll see that this module will will

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.479 
you'll see that this module will will
turn<00:02:56.700> red<00:02:57.269> eventually<00:02:58.260> instead<00:02:58.709> of<00:02:58.980> blinking

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:06.199 

there<00:03:02.489> we<00:03:02.610> go<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.500> on<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.590> computer<00:03:04.910> will<00:03:05.910> see

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
there we go and on the computer will see

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:11.300 
there we go and on the computer will see
the<00:03:06.569> same<00:03:06.900> lidar<00:03:07.230> data<00:03:07.560> as<00:03:08.900> on<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.680> actual

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
the same lidar data as on the actual

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.780 
the same lidar data as on the actual
display<00:03:12.380> so<00:03:13.380> where<00:03:13.800> now<00:03:14.519> I'll<00:03:14.640> just<00:03:14.670> turn<00:03:15.090> it

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
display so where now I'll just turn it

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.280 
display so where now I'll just turn it
we'll<00:03:17.790> see<00:03:18.030> here<00:03:18.590> that<00:03:19.590> it's<00:03:19.860> the<00:03:20.299> same<00:03:21.299> as<00:03:21.540> on

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
we'll see here that it's the same as on

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.800 
we'll see here that it's the same as on
the<00:03:22.320> computer<00:03:24.110> and<00:03:25.760> I<00:03:26.760> can<00:03:26.790> go<00:03:27.150> around<00:03:27.329> again

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
the computer and I can go around again

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.789 
the computer and I can go around again
and<00:03:28.049> the<00:03:29.010> data<00:03:29.250> is<00:03:29.519> wirelessly<00:03:30.799> transmitted

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
and the data is wirelessly transmitted

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:42.319 
and the data is wirelessly transmitted
it<00:03:31.920> to<00:03:34.100> the<00:03:35.100> PC<00:03:40.340> at<00:03:41.340> a<00:03:41.400> bit<00:03:41.760> slower<00:03:42.030> rate<00:03:42.299> than

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
it to the PC at a bit slower rate than

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.039 
it to the PC at a bit slower rate than
on<00:03:42.600> the<00:03:42.750> display<00:03:43.260> display<00:03:43.769> but<00:03:44.459> it<00:03:44.640> is

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
on the display display but it is

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:52.280 
on the display display but it is
transmitted

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.750 

okay<00:03:53.290> one<00:03:53.500> final<00:03:53.680> feature<00:03:54.040> that<00:03:54.580> I've

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
okay one final feature that I've

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.510 
okay one final feature that I've
implemented<00:03:55.210> is<00:03:55.570> the<00:03:56.110> way<00:03:56.860> of<00:03:56.890> doing

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
implemented is the way of doing

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.430 
implemented is the way of doing
calculations<00:03:58.000> on<00:03:59.820> the<00:04:00.820> display<00:04:01.180> itself<00:04:01.570> so

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
calculations on the display itself so

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.490 
calculations on the display itself so
let's<00:04:02.890> go<00:04:03.220> out<00:04:03.400> again<00:04:03.790> and<00:04:04.000> find<00:04:04.870> a<00:04:05.020> nice<00:04:05.140> spot

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
let's go out again and find a nice spot

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.160 
let's go out again and find a nice spot
where<00:04:05.740> we<00:04:05.830> have<00:04:05.980> our<00:04:06.130> room<00:04:06.630> you<00:04:07.630> can<00:04:07.840> raise<00:04:07.990> it

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
where we have our room you can raise it

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.750 
where we have our room you can raise it
up<00:04:08.260> a<00:04:08.410> bit

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
up a bit

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:16.140 
up a bit
and<00:04:11.340> here<00:04:12.340> we<00:04:12.490> have<00:04:12.670> a<00:04:12.700> scan<00:04:13.690> of<00:04:13.870> room<00:04:15.030> you<00:04:16.030> can

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
and here we have a scan of room you can

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.650 
and here we have a scan of room you can
see<00:04:16.359> me<00:04:16.540> at<00:04:16.690> the<00:04:16.840> back<00:04:17.049> here<00:04:17.440> that's<00:04:18.280> me<00:04:18.660> the

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
see me at the back here that's me the

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.780 
see me at the back here that's me the
Blue<00:04:19.840> Dot<00:04:20.049> is<00:04:20.200> the<00:04:20.350> scanner<00:04:20.620> and<00:04:20.920> then<00:04:21.220> we<00:04:21.640> have

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
Blue Dot is the scanner and then we have

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.670 
Blue Dot is the scanner and then we have
the<00:04:21.880> white<00:04:22.030> line<00:04:22.270> behind<00:04:22.600> that's<00:04:23.140> me<00:04:23.380> and<00:04:23.560> then

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
the white line behind that's me and then

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.710 
the white line behind that's me and then
we<00:04:23.830> have<00:04:24.010> the<00:04:24.100> room<00:04:24.280> so<00:04:25.000> now<00:04:25.090> let's<00:04:25.330> say<00:04:25.510> that<00:04:25.660> I

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
we have the room so now let's say that I

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.520 
we have the room so now let's say that I
would<00:04:25.930> like<00:04:26.080> to<00:04:26.260> know<00:04:26.470> the<00:04:26.650> distance<00:04:27.300> from<00:04:28.530> one

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
would like to know the distance from one

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.740 
would like to know the distance from one
of<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:29.800> edges<00:04:30.190> to<00:04:30.430> another<00:04:30.940> actually<00:04:31.420> to<00:04:31.570> use

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
of the edges to another actually to use

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.520 
of the edges to another actually to use
this<00:04:31.990> device<00:04:32.320> as<00:04:32.560> a<00:04:32.890> year<00:04:33.370> a<00:04:34.110> well<00:04:35.110> range

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
this device as a year a well range

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.520 
this device as a year a well range
scanner<00:04:35.830> to<00:04:36.280> figure<00:04:36.700> out<00:04:36.820> the<00:04:37.030> distance<00:04:37.290> so<00:04:38.290> I

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
scanner to figure out the distance so I

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.340 
scanner to figure out the distance so I
pause<00:04:39.070> the<00:04:39.100> scan<00:04:39.580> now<00:04:40.270> it's<00:04:40.420> paused<00:04:40.720> I<00:04:41.050> can

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
pause the scan now it's paused I can

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.440 
pause the scan now it's paused I can
move<00:04:41.500> what<00:04:41.800> nothing<00:04:42.100> will<00:04:42.250> happen<00:04:42.400> and<00:04:42.640> then<00:04:43.300> I

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
move what nothing will happen and then I

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.230 
move what nothing will happen and then I
can<00:04:43.780> press<00:04:44.110> and<00:04:44.370> select<00:04:45.370> a<00:04:45.520> spot<00:04:45.850> on<00:04:46.030> the

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
can press and select a spot on the

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.659 
can press and select a spot on the
display<00:04:46.570> and<00:04:47.020> select<00:04:47.320> another<00:04:47.500> one<00:04:47.620> and<00:04:48.550> it

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
display and select another one and it

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:51.720 
display and select another one and it
will<00:04:48.820> tell<00:04:49.060> me<00:04:49.090> the<00:04:49.510> distance<00:04:50.100> so<00:04:51.100> across<00:04:51.370> here

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
will tell me the distance so across here

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.770 
will tell me the distance so across here
we<00:04:52.090> have<00:04:52.680> 227<00:04:53.680> centimeters<00:04:54.580> and<00:04:54.760> on<00:04:55.510> the<00:04:55.630> other

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
we have 227 centimeters and on the other

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.230 
we have 227 centimeters and on the other
way<00:04:56.130> can<00:04:57.130> select<00:04:57.490> again<00:04:57.760> a<00:04:58.500> new<00:04:59.500> measurement

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
way can select again a new measurement

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.650 
way can select again a new measurement
there<00:05:01.240> is<00:05:01.419> 400<00:05:02.050> and<00:05:02.169> about<00:05:02.560> 4<00:05:02.860> meters<00:05:03.660> alright

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
there is 400 and about 4 meters alright

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.810 
there is 400 and about 4 meters alright
I<00:05:04.690> can<00:05:04.960> resume<00:05:05.290> the<00:05:05.440> scan<00:05:05.680> and<00:05:05.919> go<00:05:06.610> into

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
I can resume the scan and go into

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.980 
I can resume the scan and go into
another<00:05:07.090> room<00:05:07.830> do<00:05:08.830> the<00:05:08.979> same<00:05:09.190> thing<00:05:09.430> in<00:05:09.990> here

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
another room do the same thing in here

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.390 
another room do the same thing in here
we<00:05:11.620> have<00:05:11.710> a<00:05:11.740> room<00:05:12.690> we<00:05:13.690> pause<00:05:13.930> the<00:05:13.960> scan<00:05:14.400> we

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
we have a room we pause the scan we

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:22.520 
we have a room we pause the scan we
measure<00:05:15.640> from<00:05:16.030> one<00:05:16.390> inch<00:05:17.320> to<00:05:18.840> another<00:05:20.460> about

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
measure from one inch to another about

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:28.590 
measure from one inch to another about
330<00:05:23.940> yep<00:05:24.970> and<00:05:25.860> from<00:05:26.860> that<00:05:27.790> end<00:05:28.030> to<00:05:28.210> the<00:05:28.450> other

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:28.600 
330 yep and from that end to the other

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.340 
330 yep and from that end to the other
is<00:05:29.010> about<00:05:30.010> 4<00:05:30.310> meters<00:05:30.720> and<00:05:31.720> this<00:05:31.870> way<00:05:32.050> we<00:05:32.200> can

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
is about 4 meters and this way we can

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:36.600 
is about 4 meters and this way we can
actually<00:05:32.380> use<00:05:32.919> the<00:05:33.780> latest<00:05:34.780> scanner<00:05:35.200> to<00:05:35.610> get

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
actually use the latest scanner to get

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.680 
actually use the latest scanner to get
measurements<00:05:37.120> of<00:05:37.510> different<00:05:38.380> rooms<00:05:39.390> so<00:05:40.390> with

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
measurements of different rooms so with

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.409 
measurements of different rooms so with
this<00:05:40.870> project<00:05:41.169> working<00:05:41.800> we<00:05:42.760> can<00:05:42.880> just<00:05:43.090> display

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
this project working we can just display

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:46.409 
this project working we can just display
how<00:05:43.810> and<00:05:44.140> what<00:05:44.710> the<00:05:45.040> lighter<00:05:45.280> information<00:05:46.150> can

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:46.419 
how and what the lighter information can

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:48.810 
how and what the lighter information can
be<00:05:46.540> used<00:05:46.720> to<00:05:46.960> but<00:05:47.710> the<00:05:47.800> plan<00:05:48.010> is<00:05:48.040> actually<00:05:48.580> to

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
be used to but the plan is actually to

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.960 
be used to but the plan is actually to
mount<00:05:49.210> this<00:05:49.630> lighter<00:05:50.320> sensor<00:05:50.979> on<00:05:51.100> a<00:05:52.650> robot<00:05:53.650> in

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
mount this lighter sensor on a robot in

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.000 
mount this lighter sensor on a robot in
the<00:05:54.970> first<00:05:55.660> case<00:05:55.930> it<00:05:56.169> will<00:05:56.260> be<00:05:56.320> an<00:05:56.530> omni<00:05:56.860> wheel

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.010 
the first case it will be an omni wheel

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.409 
the first case it will be an omni wheel
robot<00:05:57.460> and<00:05:57.669> then<00:05:57.760> use<00:05:58.000> the<00:05:58.210> lighter

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:58.419 
robot and then use the lighter

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:00.960 
robot and then use the lighter
information<00:05:59.110> to<00:05:59.290> autonomously<00:06:00.039> navigate<00:06:00.400> it

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:00.970 
information to autonomously navigate it

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.100 
information to autonomously navigate it
around<00:06:01.210> the<00:06:01.690> room<00:06:02.460> but<00:06:03.460> in<00:06:03.700> in<00:06:04.419> the<00:06:04.599> end<00:06:04.750> our

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
around the room but in in the end our

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.959 
around the room but in in the end our
final<00:06:05.740> goal

00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:05.969 
final goal

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:07.669 
final goal
is<00:06:06.179> to<00:06:06.449> mount<00:06:06.659> the<00:06:06.809> slider<00:06:07.139> on<00:06:07.499> our

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:07.679 
is to mount the slider on our

00:06:07.679 --> 00:06:13.369 
is to mount the slider on our
quadcopters<00:06:08.669> to<00:06:09.419> make<00:06:10.049> a<00:06:10.289> a<00:06:11.089> 100%<00:06:12.089> or<00:06:12.389> a<00:06:12.449> fully

00:06:13.369 --> 00:06:13.379 
quadcopters to make a a 100% or a fully

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:17.389 
quadcopters to make a a 100% or a fully
autonomous<00:06:13.969> quadcopter<00:06:14.969> by<00:06:15.779> the<00:06:15.839> use<00:06:16.349> of<00:06:16.399> gps

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:17.399 
autonomous quadcopter by the use of gps

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:21.739 
autonomous quadcopter by the use of gps
the<00:06:17.939> IMU<00:06:18.360> senses<00:06:18.899> lighter<00:06:19.679> for<00:06:20.749> edge

00:06:21.739 --> 00:06:21.749 
the IMU senses lighter for edge

00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:25.969 
the IMU senses lighter for edge
detection<00:06:22.489> and<00:06:23.489> then<00:06:24.419> finally<00:06:25.110> an<00:06:25.289> optical

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:25.979 
detection and then finally an optical

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:28.519 
detection and then finally an optical
flow<00:06:26.279> sensor<00:06:26.789> to<00:06:27.089> detect<00:06:27.509> the<00:06:27.779> ground<00:06:28.229> even

00:06:28.519 --> 00:06:28.529 
flow sensor to detect the ground even

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:31.699 
flow sensor to detect the ground even
more<00:06:28.919> precise<00:06:29.369> than<00:06:29.669> the<00:06:29.729> GPS<00:06:30.360> signal<00:06:30.749> so

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:31.709 
more precise than the GPS signal so

00:06:31.709 --> 00:06:34.519 
more precise than the GPS signal so
that's<00:06:32.009> the<00:06:32.339> plan<00:06:32.610> and<00:06:32.879> this<00:06:33.749> is<00:06:33.899> just<00:06:34.139> a<00:06:34.259> small

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:34.529 
that's the plan and this is just a small

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:38.149 
that's the plan and this is just a small
project<00:06:34.769> on<00:06:35.129> how<00:06:35.339> to<00:06:35.399> use<00:06:35.849> and<00:06:36.469> interpret<00:06:37.469> the

00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:38.159 
project on how to use and interpret the

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:42.439 
project on how to use and interpret the
data<00:06:38.369> coming<00:06:38.849> from<00:06:38.969> the<00:06:39.179> XP<00:06:39.989> 11<00:06:40.529> lighter<00:06:41.449> thank

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:42.449
