00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.950
 You can remove up to ten 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.960
 years on top reason why from the 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.550
 First Lady Michelle Obama until the 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.010
 models of artists such as galilea 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.720
 montijo have decided to take the big step and 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.910
 today carry milestones of the hand with Pedro 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.880
 abÃ¡solo let's take that big step I'm 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.140
 list list good list let's talk 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.089
 of what face shapes are 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.710
 first they have to identify what 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:29.630
 type of face is what each 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.849
 person but what is this change of 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.430
 image the change has to make the type 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.140
 to get out and dare to do what 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.880
 what is the bang what are the bam 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.770
 what is what we are talking about that 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.220
 as you say the first lady just 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.930
 of doing and has caused world revolution 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.030
 so that's why we're talking 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.130
 right now the face shapes have 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.920
 to identify specifically if 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:54.880
 they have an oval face in the shape of a heart 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.020
 square shape or what is round 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.460
 depends on the type of face you 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.830
 have they have to identify what type 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.680
 of bangs is what they have left if 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:06.259
 they have a square face type has 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.090
 to be a little lighter and you have to 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:10.640
 be a little aside 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.710
 bangs so they have and cut that 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.450
 square now the heart heart 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.490
 it can also be a bit like 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.229
 rectangular the shape of the face and the 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.719
 rectangle that the one of hearts that 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:24.049
 you are going to have a lot what is the 

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:25.610
 front and they have very long to see what 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.829
 which is the chin then when 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.200
 they have a face type in oval or 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:33.100
 rectangular is better to make a 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.189
 bangs notice 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.220
 up not so deep but 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:41.560
 only some details taking for 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.650
 to be able to open a little what is the front 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.979
 and cut that heart now if they have the 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.860
 oval face is better to bring it from the 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:53.520
 half of your hair from that of the 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.140
 hair so they have and cut 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.299
 completely that oval is like the one 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.490
 we are seeing in this in this part in 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.799
 this area that exactly dimension 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.950
 she always uses the fringes because 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.869
 because it has too much front and this the 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.530
 fringe if you can come in that 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.600
 photo face cuts in book form 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.980
 It is also longer that fringe does not 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.800
 it remains to follow below the eyebrow 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.290
 exactly so that they can and trim 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.780
 completely face and is the way the 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.200
 ideal shape is the square face that here 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.760
 my supermodel the accomplice goodbye is what 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.519
 what are we going to do today I knew 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.870
 that was square but not so much 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.440
 now there's the face I have when I do not 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.000

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.819
 It has the square face that is the face 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.680
 perfect to have any kind of 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.490
 bangs then now let's do 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:46.950
 the change 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:49.300
 And I swear I do not have the face but 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.310
 we will also see a lot in the 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.790
 red carpets that come very soon 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.850
 who in what I do not know is that I and 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:01.830
 This will also give a freshness 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:05.200
 for a 2013 full of challenges full of 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:08.350
 knowledge and there we welcome the

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.439

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.239
 get to the fourth floor then it 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:21.790
 freshness this time of life I fell 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.860
 but wonderful is now another of the 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.290
 advice the first day that you 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:30.370
 cut fringe sometimes hair as you have 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.709
 given so many years in question the canvas 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.780
 bad devote you down do not split it 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.120
 in the middle do not split it to everything that is 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.870
 the fringe the first week is going to be 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.329
 the problem but if you educate him and 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.040
 you start educating him in a matter of 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:47.139
 where do you want it and how are you going to be 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.530
 accommodating I do not want to leave is going to be a 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:53.139
 a little bit simpler so 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:56.620
 you bring this you can see that here 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:58.540
 Adriana also have I have to 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.889
 cut a little more still ok 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.629
 then let's take a brief pause 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:03.430
 with his eyes closed, he ordered the break 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:05.349
 because I do not want to see until I finish 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.769
 because it makes me nervous those scissors and 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:07.769
 we came back 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.849

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:20.479

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.639
 a quinceanera 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.110
 is that I have to start living at 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:32.389
 from this moment because I have to 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.770
 gain from experience that thing that 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:40.030
 youth divine treasure 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:40.030
