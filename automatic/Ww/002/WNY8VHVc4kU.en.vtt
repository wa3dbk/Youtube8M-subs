00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
noticed that my base is actually really

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.810 
noticed that my base is actually really
strong<00:00:12.269> as<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.870> farming<00:00:13.380> base<00:00:13.530> I've<00:00:14.370> been<00:00:14.549> using

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
strong as a farming base I've been using

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.420 
strong as a farming base I've been using
it<00:00:14.910> about<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.150> month<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:15.870> half<00:00:15.920> by<00:00:16.920> now<00:00:17.130> and

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
it about a month and a half by now and

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.140 
it about a month and a half by now and
I've<00:00:17.940> been<00:00:18.150> sniped<00:00:18.449> for<00:00:18.810> over<00:00:19.230> 300<00:00:20.130> times<00:00:20.490> and

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
I've been sniped for over 300 times and

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.529 
I've been sniped for over 300 times and
only<00:00:21.420> been<00:00:21.779> rated<00:00:22.020> about<00:00:22.800> five<00:00:23.250> maybe<00:00:23.789> ten

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
only been rated about five maybe ten

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.939 
only been rated about five maybe ten
maximum<00:00:25.189> times<00:00:26.359> for<00:00:27.359> my<00:00:27.510> resources<00:00:28.230> so<00:00:28.439> my

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
maximum times for my resources so my

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.679 
maximum times for my resources so my
base<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.160> really<00:00:29.490> strong<00:00:29.699> against<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.210> it's

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
base is really strong against that it's

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.110 
base is really strong against that it's
really<00:00:30.869> spread<00:00:31.410> out<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.710> stuff<00:00:31.949> so<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.700> just

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120

wanted to show you guys a base build of
my<00:00:36.210> own<00:00:36.480> base<00:00:36.930> which<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.410> made<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:38.340> just<00:00:38.940> to

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
my own base which I made so just to

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.340 
my own base which I made so just to
switch<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.360> up<00:00:39.420> with<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.780> let's<00:00:39.960> play<00:00:40.170> series
