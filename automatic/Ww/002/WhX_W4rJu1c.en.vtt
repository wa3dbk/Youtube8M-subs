like the mage bow and the DDS for the
kale<00:04:32.240> that<00:04:32.960> could<00:04:33.200> work<00:04:33.980> pretty<00:04:34.250> well

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
kale that could work pretty well

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.739 
kale that could work pretty well
actually<00:04:34.580> and

00:04:36.739 --> 00:04:36.749 
actually and

00:04:44.519 --> 00:04:44.529 
gain level fire so that's that's good

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:45.929

00:04:50.859 --> 00:04:54.119 
embrace but i'm using hey paws instead
is<00:04:52.349> certainly<00:04:53.349> percent<00:04:53.679> left<00:04:53.829> in<00:04:53.979> these

00:04:54.119 --> 00:04:54.129 
is certainly percent left in these

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:57.299 
is certainly percent left in these
that'll<00:04:54.669> probably<00:04:55.119> get<00:04:55.359> me<00:04:55.449> up<00:04:55.539> to<00:04:55.659> about<00:04:56.309> 65

00:04:57.299 --> 00:04:57.309 
that'll probably get me up to about 65

00:04:57.309 --> 00:04:58.949 
that'll probably get me up to about 65
should<00:04:57.669> run<00:04:57.789> for<00:04:57.909> something<00:04:58.389> but<00:04:58.539> i<00:04:58.569> really

00:04:58.949 --> 00:04:58.959 
should run for something but i really

00:04:58.959 --> 00:05:00.899 
should run for something but i really
don't<00:04:58.989> need<00:04:59.259> to<00:04:59.409> quest<00:04:59.679> on<00:04:59.889> this<00:05:00.039> account<00:05:00.309> that

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:00.909 
don't need to quest on this account that

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:02.789 
don't need to quest on this account that
is<00:05:01.029> one<00:05:01.629> of<00:05:01.779> the<00:05:01.929> things<00:05:02.139> I've<00:05:02.379> not<00:05:02.619> really

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:02.799 
is one of the things I've not really

00:05:02.799 --> 00:05:05.129 
is one of the things I've not really
done<00:05:02.949> I've<00:05:03.789> complete<00:05:04.239> free<00:05:04.509> question<00:05:04.929> that's

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:05.139 
done I've complete free question that's

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:09.269 
done I've complete free question that's
it<00:05:05.409> and<00:05:05.619> I<00:05:06.219> think<00:05:06.489> it's<00:05:06.669> hundred<00:05:07.949> 874<00:05:08.949> barrows

00:05:09.269 --> 00:05:09.279 
it and I think it's hundred 874 barrows

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:11.659 
it and I think it's hundred 874 barrows
groups<00:05:09.610> obviously<00:05:10.269> can't<00:05:10.539> get<00:05:10.719> that<00:05:10.839> one<00:05:10.899> def

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
groups obviously can't get that one def

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:16.019 
groups obviously can't get that one def
so<00:05:12.669> yeah<00:05:12.819> it's<00:05:12.969> a<00:05:13.029> bit<00:05:13.329> and<00:05:14.579> how<00:05:15.579> can<00:05:15.639> you<00:05:15.879> put

00:05:16.019 --> 00:05:16.029 
so yeah it's a bit and how can you put

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:21.779 
so yeah it's a bit and how can you put
it<00:05:16.209> a<00:05:16.419> bit<00:05:17.349> lower<00:05:17.619> than<00:05:17.829> 170<00:05:18.729> to<00:05:19.719> get<00:05:19.959> him<00:05:20.759> to<00:05:21.759> go

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:21.789 
it a bit lower than 170 to get him to go

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:23.909 
it a bit lower than 170 to get him to go
and<00:05:21.999> get<00:05:22.089> it<00:05:22.149> the<00:05:22.719> mithril<00:05:23.139> gloves<00:05:23.379> are<00:05:23.649> the

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 
and get it the mithril gloves are the

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:25.799 
and get it the mithril gloves are the
room<00:05:24.459> gloves<00:05:24.729> or<00:05:24.909> whatever<00:05:25.179> they<00:05:25.329> are<00:05:25.360> but

I don't know much about it but anyway
I've<00:05:34.629> worked<00:05:34.869> it<00:05:35.019> out<00:05:35.049> i<00:05:35.199> will<00:05:35.649> not<00:05:35.799> get<00:05:36.039> over

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:36.279 
I've worked it out i will not get over

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:39.839 
I've worked it out i will not get over
60th<00:05:36.759> that<00:05:36.969> so<00:05:37.719> what<00:05:38.589> what<00:05:39.069> also<00:05:39.399> i'm<00:05:39.489> thinking

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:39.849 
60th that so what what also i'm thinking

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:42.569 
60th that so what what also i'm thinking
about<00:05:39.969> is<00:05:40.389> if<00:05:40.749> i<00:05:41.110> get<00:05:41.349> as<00:05:41.860> you<00:05:42.039> can<00:05:42.159> see<00:05:42.279> a<00:05:42.309> thick

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:42.579 
about is if i get as you can see a thick

00:05:42.579 --> 00:05:45.389 
about is if i get as you can see a thick
one<00:05:42.729> dungeon<00:05:42.999> area<00:05:43.269> but<00:05:43.659> if<00:05:44.049> i<00:05:44.259> go<00:05:44.409> get<00:05:44.619> 85<00:05:44.919> and

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:45.399 
one dungeon area but if i go get 85 and

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:46.859 
one dungeon area but if i go get 85 and
then<00:05:45.549> it<00:05:45.669> can<00:05:45.819> like<00:05:45.969> I've<00:05:46.179> got<00:05:46.539> my<00:05:46.659> first

00:05:46.859 --> 00:05:46.869 
then it can like I've got my first

00:05:46.869 --> 00:05:49.379 
then it can like I've got my first
classic<00:05:47.409> which<00:05:48.039> right<00:05:48.789> if<00:05:49.029> I'm<00:05:49.239> obviously

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:49.389 
classic which right if I'm obviously

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:52.169 
classic which right if I'm obviously
going<00:05:49.719> to<00:05:49.779> make<00:05:49.929> it<00:05:50.079> matter<00:05:50.289> now<00:05:50.349> arrange<00:05:50.739> it<00:05:51.699> I

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:52.179 
going to make it matter now arrange it I

00:05:52.179 --> 00:05:55.709 
going to make it matter now arrange it I
can<00:05:52.539> even<00:05:52.779> get<00:05:53.079> a<00:05:53.259> crossbow<00:05:53.919> I<00:05:54.159> get<00:05:54.610> 80<00:05:55.149> attack

can even get a crossbow I get 80 attack

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:58.709 
can even get a crossbow I get 80 attack
and<00:05:55.989> get<00:05:56.199> a<00:05:56.229> rapier<00:05:56.709> now<00:05:57.639> what<00:05:58.089> was<00:05:58.119> thinking

00:05:58.709 --> 00:05:58.719 
and get a rapier now what was thinking

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:03.839 
and get a rapier now what was thinking
is<00:05:59.039> if<00:06:00.039> i<00:06:00.189> did<00:06:00.339> a<00:06:00.369> crossbow<00:06:00.939> to<00:06:01.509> a<00:06:02.069> g'mar<00:06:03.069> that'd

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:03.849 
is if i did a crossbow to a g'mar that'd

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:05.819 
is if i did a crossbow to a g'mar that'd
be<00:06:03.999> pretty<00:06:04.209> good<00:06:04.419> while<00:06:04.809> blitzing<00:06:05.469> and<00:06:05.649> stuff

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:05.829 
be pretty good while blitzing and stuff

00:06:05.829 --> 00:06:08.579 
be pretty good while blitzing and stuff
and<00:06:06.369> then<00:06:06.549> pull<00:06:06.729> out<00:06:06.819> a<00:06:06.849> dds<00:06:07.749> for<00:06:07.959> the<00:06:08.049> spec<00:06:08.319> are

00:06:08.579 --> 00:06:08.589 
and then pull out a dds for the spec are

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:11.369 
and then pull out a dds for the spec are
a<00:06:08.860> g'mar<00:06:09.339> whatever<00:06:09.779> it's<00:06:10.779> a<00:06:10.929> yeah<00:06:11.110> that'd<00:06:11.259> be

00:06:11.369 --> 00:06:11.379 
a g'mar whatever it's a yeah that'd be

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:13.229 
a g'mar whatever it's a yeah that'd be
pretty<00:06:11.559> good<00:06:11.799> but<00:06:12.099> then<00:06:12.549> what<00:06:12.819> i<00:06:12.849> could<00:06:12.939> do

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:13.239 
pretty good but then what i could do

00:06:13.239 --> 00:06:15.119 
pretty good but then what i could do
with<00:06:13.269> that<00:06:13.449> crossbow<00:06:14.110> is<00:06:14.349> I<00:06:14.379> could<00:06:14.649> go<00:06:14.860> make

00:06:15.119 --> 00:06:15.129 
with that crossbow is I could go make

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:17.759 
with that crossbow is I could go make
more<00:06:15.489> money<00:06:15.639> at<00:06:15.849> fresh<00:06:16.089> dragons<00:06:16.509> and<00:06:16.839> go<00:06:17.649> and

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:17.769 
more money at fresh dragons and go and

00:06:17.769 --> 00:06:19.829 
more money at fresh dragons and go and
get<00:06:17.860> that<00:06:18.069> now<00:06:18.219> range<00:06:18.519> if<00:06:18.759> you're<00:06:18.909> done<00:06:19.059> if

00:06:19.829 --> 00:06:19.839 
get that now range if you're done if

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:23.009 
get that now range if you're done if
you're<00:06:20.049> not<00:06:20.169> like<00:06:20.439> sane<00:06:20.979> and<00:06:21.219> like<00:06:22.019> meaning

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:23.019 
you're not like sane and like meaning

00:06:23.019 --> 00:06:25.350 
you're not like sane and like meaning
because<00:06:23.829> frost<00:06:24.129> dragons<00:06:24.519> are<00:06:24.699> completely

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 
because frost dragons are completely

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.999 
because frost dragons are completely
emptying<00:06:25.719> I<00:06:25.839> could<00:06:26.019> set<00:06:26.289> up<00:06:26.379> a<00:06:26.469> cannon<00:06:26.799> there

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:27.009 
emptying I could set up a cannon there

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:29.159 
emptying I could set up a cannon there
and<00:06:27.249> range<00:06:27.519> like<00:06:27.939> frost<00:06:28.329> dragons<00:06:28.689> probably

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:29.169 
and range like frost dragons probably

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:32.279 
and range like frost dragons probably
get<00:06:29.289> about<00:06:29.379> add<00:06:30.099> up<00:06:30.819> on<00:06:31.419> a<00:06:31.539> rough<00:06:31.809> estimate

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:32.289 
get about add up on a rough estimate

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:34.949 
get about add up on a rough estimate
probably<00:06:32.619> get<00:06:32.799> about<00:06:32.860> like<00:06:33.729> 50k<00:06:34.209> XP<00:06:34.659> per<00:06:34.809> hour

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:34.959 
probably get about like 50k XP per hour

00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:38.459
