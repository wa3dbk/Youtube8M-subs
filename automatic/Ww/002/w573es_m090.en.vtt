 that mask that leaves the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.270
 People, that most beautiful face in the world. 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.510
 Wonderful 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.400
 only that name I made a super myth 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.369
 Quick here for you to see how I 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.960
 I apply teaching the step by step 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:31.080
 That 's all you just built there. 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.910
 watching with kisses 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.270
 so we'll use this cream 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.040
 solutions that is a face mask 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.219
 It will open me and she has a 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.840
 very cool clay texture and has a 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:48.570
 minty smell and have some floquinhos 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.930
 greenbacks so I spend a little in the hand 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.809
 spread it with both of you in both hands and 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.550
 applying on the face by tapping 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.949
 the mask is 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.070
 It's important that you do not make a layer 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.780
 very thin makes a thicker layer 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.700
 and lends mastery and applies across the face 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:12.270
 apply the mask where you have it 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.799
 enough cloves that she helps to go 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.740
 help remove some of these 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.479
 opel slaves by clicking on the 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.850
 cheeks on the nose 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.070
 I applied a lot on the nose, which is where I 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.570
 I have more cloves in some 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:30.329
 cheeks and apply well to nascar or apply 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:38.880
 across the face and a thicker layer 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:42.390
 had all the product if you need to pay 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:47.220
 And now, with the mask applied, I 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:50.520
 I'll leave it for about 25 minutes and 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:57.450
 rinse and like the video I hope 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:02:00.110
 yes right win the cake but I hope 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.380
 You have enjoyed understanding. 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.130
 she leaves the face super wonderful 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.840
 cecchim 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.240
 besides eliminating some ways that the 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.820
 Can you guys be here in high school to help? 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.700
 from the little law 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:16.250
 So I was going to go in and I stayed with her. 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.600
 about 20-30 minutes 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.550
 the face 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.270
 I retired with the water to treat 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.290
 before because only lose strength on top and 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.180
 It's a little bother to stay one. 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.060
 little red but like mine 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.130
 It is sensible to attach a moisturizing bird 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.070
 but as I like to spend then I step 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.890
 moisturizer then she's super cheap 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.480
 super recommend this but trained 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.290
 but then this is what I hope you 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:45.640
 I liked what I liked down here. 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.640
 down here too 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.760
