00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.329
 yes 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.480
 hello hi skeleton jana how are you good 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.789
 I'm ready to watch a full video 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.489
 of advice to stamp then we are going 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.779
 there first of all tell you that all 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:24.300
 the scammers that I have and have 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.099
 tested work perfectly now 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.050
 I know if as we have our 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.669
 preferences always in one with which 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.950
 we feel more comfortable because the only thing 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:35.250
 What we have to do is bet on that 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.899
 and like me you will also have 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.329
 your preferences with scrapers 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.920
 I prefer the metal that although 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.739
 the long leaves the plates a little more 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.030
 ceuta and that if nothing happens to them they are 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.010
 much more effective at the time of 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.440
 drag and now comes the question of 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.960
 million serve all the other tests for 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.329
 cover then the answer is yes but with 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.399
 but we must choose the colors that 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.440
 be more pigmented and the thicker 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.720
 better since they will offer more 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.560
 coverage and will make more contrast with the 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.239
 colors that we choose base 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.590
 before embarking on the adventure if 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.300
 we want to know if our enamels 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.780
 combine well we can do a test 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.180
 on a folio 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.130
 it's better to make a good time trap 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.570
 so you can call it is your trap that 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.570
 then they are dissatisfied with our 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.759
 manicure I do not know if you can appreciate it in 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.070
 the images but when I pick up the 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.990
 painting with the pattern I hope some 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.110
 seconds before stamping so that it 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.090
 creates a thin film is visible because 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.729
 the enamel starts to lose its shine is 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.350
 just the right moment to stamp the 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.030
 paint on that plant that gets smeared 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.030
 How often is that courage? 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.090
 It is very important also that at the time 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.710
 of scraper dough we do several 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.410
 times and in different directions if 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.450
 it can be this way we will prevent them from forming 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:53.040
 micro air bubbles on the plate and 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.040
 our drawing is left with holes 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.090
 we have to choose the right position 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.450
 and do not put too much pressure with the 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.450
 seal 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.900
 finally and to protect the 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.120
 stamping we must procure the times 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.680
 passed with the brush and prevent 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.260
 hairs get as close as possible to the 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.260
 Stamping in the purest planning style 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.960
 and already to end allow very advice 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.510
 more if it does not come out the first 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.010
 please do not lie that I do not know 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.590
 what's the matter with you? 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.730
 as for life and the truquillo I know 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.980
 that you are going to do some manicures 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.870
 perfect for envy and if you liked 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.800
 the video do not forget the right above 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:52.490
 they spend very good bye 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.490
 yes
