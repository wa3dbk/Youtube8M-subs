00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
now in a few of my previous videos I may

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.370 
now in a few of my previous videos I may
have<00:00:02.520> talked<00:00:02.730> about<00:00:02.850> how<00:00:03.060> great<00:00:03.300> the<00:00:03.990> live

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
have talked about how great the live

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.450 
have talked about how great the live
view<00:00:04.620> AF<00:00:05.100> system<00:00:05.609> works<00:00:05.850> in<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.540> EOS<00:00:06.990> 70d<00:00:07.470> so

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
view AF system works in the EOS 70d so

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.820 
view AF system works in the EOS 70d so
now<00:00:09.179> I'm<00:00:09.420> not<00:00:09.570> denying<00:00:10.050> that<00:00:10.290> it<00:00:10.440> works<00:00:10.620> now

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
now I'm not denying that it works now

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.799 
now I'm not denying that it works now
but<00:00:11.219> still<00:00:11.700> I'm<00:00:12.030> not<00:00:12.300> saying<00:00:12.509> you<00:00:12.599> shouldn't

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
but still I'm not saying you shouldn't

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.200 
but still I'm not saying you shouldn't
use<00:00:13.019> it<00:00:13.049> I'm<00:00:13.679> just<00:00:14.009> gonna<00:00:14.190> tell<00:00:14.460> you<00:00:14.639> why<00:00:15.179> I

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
use it I'm just gonna tell you why I

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.750 
use it I'm just gonna tell you why I
still<00:00:15.750> prefer<00:00:15.990> to<00:00:16.289> use<00:00:16.800> mono<00:00:17.190> focus<00:00:17.789> over<00:00:18.449> the

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760 
still prefer to use mono focus over the

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.859 
still prefer to use mono focus over the
servo<00:00:20.760> movie<00:00:21.539> focus<00:00:22.050> on<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.949> EOS<00:00:23.250> 70d<00:00:23.869> despite

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
servo movie focus on the EOS 70d despite

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.009 
servo movie focus on the EOS 70d despite
having<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.289> AF<00:00:26.039> system<00:00:26.430> in<00:00:26.820> movie<00:00:27.570> mode<00:00:27.750> that

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
having a AF system in movie mode that

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.189 
having a AF system in movie mode that
actually<00:00:28.590> works<00:00:28.920> good<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.789> still<00:00:30.660> prefer<00:00:30.990> to

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
actually works good I still prefer to

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.610 
actually works good I still prefer to
use<00:00:31.740> manual<00:00:32.309> focus<00:00:32.550> because<00:00:33.510> from<00:00:34.110> my<00:00:34.170> point

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
use manual focus because from my point

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.620 
use manual focus because from my point
of<00:00:34.739> view<00:00:34.800> manual<00:00:35.340> focus<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.180> way<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.390> go

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
of view manual focus is the way to go

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.350 
of view manual focus is the way to go
when<00:00:37.079> you're<00:00:37.110> shooting<00:00:37.649> video<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:38.730> when<00:00:39.149> I

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
when you're shooting video so when I

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.720 
when you're shooting video so when I
should<00:00:39.600> video<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:40.050> always<00:00:40.500> use<00:00:41.129> manual<00:00:41.579> focus

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
should video I always use manual focus

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.900 
should video I always use manual focus
so<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:43.020> autofocus<00:00:43.500> works<00:00:43.980> very<00:00:44.430> well<00:00:44.579> with

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
so the autofocus works very well with

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.959 
so the autofocus works very well with
static<00:00:45.360> objects<00:00:45.989> but<00:00:46.260> actually<00:00:46.890> not<00:00:47.250> so<00:00:47.670> good

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
static objects but actually not so good

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.520 
static objects but actually not so good
with<00:00:48.180> objects<00:00:48.750> they<00:00:48.840> are<00:00:48.870> constantly<00:00:49.320> moving

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
with objects they are constantly moving

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.709 
with objects they are constantly moving
and<00:00:49.890> shifting<00:00:50.010> across<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.579> frame<00:00:50.820> going<00:00:51.539> in

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
and shifting across the frame going in

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.740 
and shifting across the frame going in
and<00:00:51.870> out<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.170> focus<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:53.100> for<00:00:53.789> example<00:00:54.210> on<00:00:54.480> this

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
and out of focus so for example on this

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.680 
and out of focus so for example on this
scene<00:00:54.989> here<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.350> use<00:00:55.710> manual<00:00:56.309> focus<00:00:56.670> now<00:00:57.629> you

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
scene here I use manual focus now you

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.660 
scene here I use manual focus now you
can<00:00:58.020> see<00:00:58.199> these<00:00:58.379> basketball<00:00:59.039> players<00:00:59.399> they're

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
can see these basketball players they're

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.330 
can see these basketball players they're
moving<00:00:59.969> very<00:01:00.000> quick<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.410> use<00:01:01.680> manual<00:01:02.190> focus

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
moving very quick so I use manual focus

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.210 
moving very quick so I use manual focus
on<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:03.329> shot<00:01:03.629> so<00:01:04.049> I'm<00:01:04.170> gonna<00:01:04.379> start<00:01:04.830> with

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
on this shot so I'm gonna start with

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.539 
on this shot so I'm gonna start with
showing<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.510> few<00:01:06.720> examples<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.500> when<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.189> some

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
showing a few examples of when and some

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.550 
showing a few examples of when and some
circumstances<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.570> when<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.020> autofocus

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
circumstances of when the autofocus

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.440 
circumstances of when the autofocus
doesn't<00:01:11.520> work<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.710> the<00:01:13.710> auto<00:01:14.159> focus<00:01:14.490> will

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
doesn't work so the auto focus will

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.719 
doesn't work so the auto focus will
eventually<00:01:15.990> fail<00:01:16.350> when<00:01:16.830> your<00:01:17.070> subject<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.700> a

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
eventually fail when your subject is a

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.149 
eventually fail when your subject is a
very<00:01:18.150> low<00:01:18.390> contrast<00:01:18.960> for<00:01:19.320> example<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.920> black

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
very low contrast for example a black

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.719 
very low contrast for example a black
surface<00:01:21.119> or<00:01:21.630> if<00:01:22.170> you're<00:01:22.830> seeing<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.159> too<00:01:23.310> dark

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
surface or if you're seeing is too dark

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.730 
surface or if you're seeing is too dark
the<00:01:24.270> autofocus<00:01:24.689> will<00:01:24.990> also<00:01:25.229> fail<00:01:25.409> if<00:01:25.680> the

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
the autofocus will also fail if the

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.550 
the autofocus will also fail if the
scene<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.280> too<00:01:26.400> dark<00:01:26.790> so<00:01:27.270> another<00:01:28.259> thing<00:01:28.350> I've

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
scene is too dark so another thing I've

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.980 
scene is too dark so another thing I've
noticed<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:29.100> if<00:01:29.520> your<00:01:29.790> subject<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.299> too<00:01:30.630> far

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
noticed is if your subject is too far

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.620 
noticed is if your subject is too far
out<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.380> focus

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
out of focus

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.709 
out of focus
it<00:01:33.140> will<00:01:33.500> fail<00:01:33.890> also<00:01:34.490> so<00:01:36.310> why<00:01:37.310> do<00:01:37.369> I<00:01:37.820> still<00:01:38.420> use

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:38.719 
it will fail also so why do I still use

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:41.350 
it will fail also so why do I still use
manual<00:01:39.289> focus<00:01:39.439> when<00:01:40.039> I<00:01:40.219> still<00:01:40.759> have<00:01:41.090> an

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
manual focus when I still have an

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.230 
manual focus when I still have an
autofocus<00:01:42.289> system<00:01:42.680> that<00:01:43.430> works<00:01:43.610> fine<00:01:43.970> if<00:01:44.210> not

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
autofocus system that works fine if not

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.149 
autofocus system that works fine if not
better<00:01:44.960> on<00:01:45.500> most<00:01:46.100> occasions<00:01:46.630> so<00:01:47.829> if<00:01:48.829> you<00:01:49.039> ask

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
better on most occasions so if you ask

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.399 
better on most occasions so if you ask
me<00:01:49.549> it's<00:01:49.850> easier<00:01:50.270> to<00:01:50.390> trust<00:01:50.689> yourself<00:01:50.810> than

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
me it's easier to trust yourself than

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.490 
me it's easier to trust yourself than
something<00:01:51.799> else<00:01:52.310> so<00:01:52.970> I<00:01:53.329> like<00:01:54.020> to<00:01:54.110> trust<00:01:54.350> myself

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
something else so I like to trust myself

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.590 
something else so I like to trust myself
with<00:01:54.770> the<00:01:54.950> focus<00:01:55.369> because<00:01:56.000> I<00:01:56.030> have<00:01:56.270> full

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
with the focus because I have full

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.929 
with the focus because I have full
control<00:01:56.780> over<00:01:57.319> what<00:01:57.829> I'm<00:01:58.159> doing<00:01:58.610> what<00:01:58.850> I'm

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
control over what I'm doing what I'm

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.350 
control over what I'm doing what I'm
focusing<00:01:59.479> on<00:01:59.630> so<00:02:00.310> one<00:02:01.310> more<00:02:01.490> thing<00:02:01.520> is<00:02:01.850> when

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
focusing on so one more thing is when

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.719 
focusing on so one more thing is when
you're<00:02:02.539> using<00:02:02.720> the<00:02:02.960> autofocus<00:02:03.439> the<00:02:04.009> speed<00:02:04.490> of

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
you're using the autofocus the speed of

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.300 
you're using the autofocus the speed of
the<00:02:04.939> focus<00:02:05.360> is<00:02:05.539> uncontrollable<00:02:06.470> the<00:02:06.890> speed<00:02:07.189> of

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
the focus is uncontrollable the speed of

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.960 
the focus is uncontrollable the speed of
the<00:02:07.459> pull<00:02:07.849> itself<00:02:08.420> it's<00:02:08.690> at<00:02:08.869> a<00:02:09.170> fixed<00:02:09.739> speed<00:02:10.519> so

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
the pull itself it's at a fixed speed so

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.180 
the pull itself it's at a fixed speed so
I<00:02:11.209> can't<00:02:11.540> alter<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:12.349> speed<00:02:12.620> of<00:02:12.769> the<00:02:12.890> focus

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
I can't alter the speed of the focus

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.370 
I can't alter the speed of the focus
ball<00:02:13.340> I<00:02:13.519> I<00:02:13.790> can't<00:02:14.150> choose<00:02:14.569> the<00:02:14.750> bow<00:02:14.870> on<00:02:14.989> a<00:02:15.080> fast

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
ball I I can't choose the bow on a fast

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.920 
ball I I can't choose the bow on a fast
ball<00:02:15.590> or<00:02:15.799> a<00:02:15.830> slow<00:02:16.310> pool<00:02:16.670> but<00:02:17.269> if<00:02:17.540> I<00:02:17.690> mana

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
ball or a slow pool but if I mana

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.199 
ball or a slow pool but if I mana
focusing<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.620> speed<00:02:18.980> of<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.519> focus<00:02:19.880> ball<00:02:20.060> is

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
focusing the speed of the focus ball is

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.990 
focusing the speed of the focus ball is
entirely<00:02:20.840> up<00:02:21.200> to<00:02:21.260> myself<00:02:21.650> so<00:02:22.489> it<00:02:22.670> gives<00:02:22.849> me

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
entirely up to myself so it gives me

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.089 
entirely up to myself so it gives me
more<00:02:23.180> creative<00:02:23.630> space<00:02:23.900> I<00:02:24.230> can<00:02:24.410> have<00:02:24.799> more

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
more creative space I can have more

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.360 
more creative space I can have more
creative<00:02:25.519> control<00:02:26.030> so<00:02:26.870> I<00:02:27.110> can<00:02:27.410> expand<00:02:28.340> my

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
creative control so I can expand my

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.839 
creative control so I can expand my
creativity<00:02:29.030> even<00:02:29.510> better<00:02:30.140> with<00:02:30.739> manual<00:02:31.400> focus

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
creativity even better with manual focus

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.970 
creativity even better with manual focus
now<00:02:32.720> one<00:02:32.930> more<00:02:33.049> thing<00:02:33.110> to<00:02:33.319> take<00:02:33.440> note<00:02:33.500> of<00:02:33.680> is

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
now one more thing to take note of is

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.690 
now one more thing to take note of is
it's<00:02:34.370> not<00:02:34.880> how<00:02:35.510> good<00:02:35.569> the<00:02:36.140> system<00:02:36.500> is<00:02:36.680> it's<00:02:37.370> if

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
it's not how good the system is it's if

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.030 
it's not how good the system is it's if
you<00:02:38.090> actually<00:02:38.630> take<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:38.930> risk<00:02:39.350> for<00:02:39.620> example

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
you actually take the risk for example

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.250 
you actually take the risk for example
you're<00:02:40.459> in<00:02:40.579> your<00:02:41.390> shooting<00:02:41.569> a<00:02:41.690> wedding<00:02:41.930> and

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
you're in your shooting a wedding and

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.979 
you're in your shooting a wedding and
you<00:02:42.380> simply<00:02:42.739> can't<00:02:43.040> afford<00:02:43.579> to<00:02:44.180> lose<00:02:44.390> a<00:02:44.630> shot

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
you simply can't afford to lose a shot

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.490 
you simply can't afford to lose a shot
so<00:02:45.670> when<00:02:46.670> I<00:02:46.700> shoot<00:02:46.970> weddings<00:02:47.209> I<00:02:47.569> always<00:02:48.200> always

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
so when I shoot weddings I always always

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.520 
so when I shoot weddings I always always
use<00:02:49.280> manual<00:02:49.760> focus<00:02:49.940> because<00:02:50.600> I<00:02:50.750> simply<00:02:51.109> cannot

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
use manual focus because I simply cannot

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.199 
use manual focus because I simply cannot
before<00:02:52.160> they're<00:02:52.370> having<00:02:52.579> the<00:02:52.639> autofocus<00:02:53.030> to

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
before they're having the autofocus to

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.990 
before they're having the autofocus to
fail<00:02:53.720> on<00:02:53.989> me<00:02:54.170> when<00:02:54.769> I'm<00:02:55.040> shooting<00:02:55.670> something

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
fail on me when I'm shooting something

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.530 
fail on me when I'm shooting something
important<00:02:56.780> for<00:02:57.200> example<00:02:57.260> I'm<00:02:57.680> shooting<00:02:58.010> at<00:02:58.160> a

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
important for example I'm shooting at a

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.289 
important for example I'm shooting at a
1.4<00:02:59.540> aperture<00:03:00.019> and<00:03:00.340> something's<00:03:01.340> going<00:03:01.609> on<00:03:01.700> so

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
1.4 aperture and something's going on so

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.660 
1.4 aperture and something's going on so
if<00:03:02.780> I'm<00:03:03.109> relying<00:03:03.560> on<00:03:03.680> the<00:03:03.799> matter<00:03:03.980> of<00:03:04.160> auto

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
if I'm relying on the matter of auto

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.449 
if I'm relying on the matter of auto
focus<00:03:05.239> and<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:05.989> auto<00:03:06.170> focus<00:03:06.290> decides<00:03:06.799> to<00:03:06.980> fail

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
focus and the auto focus decides to fail

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.780 
focus and the auto focus decides to fail
on<00:03:07.670> me<00:03:07.819> at<00:03:07.940> that<00:03:08.120> point<00:03:08.420> I<00:03:08.780> simply<00:03:09.650> miss<00:03:10.220> the

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
on me at that point I simply miss the

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.440 
on me at that point I simply miss the
shot<00:03:11.000> so<00:03:11.709> that<00:03:12.709> could<00:03:12.950> be<00:03:12.980> pretty<00:03:13.370> bad<00:03:13.760> and<00:03:14.209> one

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
shot so that could be pretty bad and one

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:15.849 
shot so that could be pretty bad and one
more<00:03:14.630> thing<00:03:14.750> is<00:03:14.870> mellow<00:03:15.139> focus<00:03:15.530> is<00:03:15.680> actually

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
more thing is mellow focus is actually

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:19.540 
more thing is mellow focus is actually
somewhat<00:03:16.819> easier<00:03:17.690> because<00:03:18.290> for<00:03:18.470> me<00:03:18.620> it's

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
somewhat easier because for me it's

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.870 
somewhat easier because for me it's
to<00:03:20.090> simply<00:03:20.570> turn<00:03:20.990> the<00:03:21.620> focus<00:03:22.040> ring<00:03:22.250> than<00:03:22.760> to

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
to simply turn the focus ring than to

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.360 
to simply turn the focus ring than to
touch<00:03:23.090> all<00:03:23.300> over<00:03:23.660> the<00:03:23.750> screen<00:03:24.200> to<00:03:24.770> choose<00:03:25.040> what

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
touch all over the screen to choose what

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.950 
touch all over the screen to choose what
you<00:03:25.490> want<00:03:25.610> books<00:03:25.820> especially<00:03:26.540> when<00:03:26.780> you're

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:26.960 
you want books especially when you're

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:27.520 
you want books especially when you're
gripping

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
gripping

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.610 
gripping
VDSL<00:03:28.490> are<00:03:28.700> like<00:03:28.940> so<00:03:29.240> one<00:03:29.750> one<00:03:30.200> hand<00:03:30.380> is<00:03:30.470> on<00:03:30.590> a

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
VDSL are like so one one hand is on a

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.990 
VDSL are like so one one hand is on a
grip<00:03:30.860> one<00:03:31.220> hand<00:03:31.370> is<00:03:31.460> on<00:03:31.580> the<00:03:31.610> lens<00:03:31.850> you

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
grip one hand is on the lens you

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.170 
grip one hand is on the lens you
basically<00:03:32.510> have<00:03:32.810> no<00:03:33.200> other<00:03:33.410> hand<00:03:33.710> to<00:03:33.890> operate

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
basically have no other hand to operate

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.230 
basically have no other hand to operate
the<00:03:35.180> screen<00:03:35.510> unless<00:03:35.990> you<00:03:36.490> start<00:03:37.490> your<00:03:37.640> turn<00:03:38.030> or

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.240 
the screen unless you start your turn or

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.370 
the screen unless you start your turn or
something<00:03:38.290> but<00:03:39.290> still<00:03:39.560> I<00:03:39.860> just<00:03:40.580> think<00:03:41.120> it's

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
something but still I just think it's

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.820 
something but still I just think it's
more<00:03:42.380> normal<00:03:42.880> tweak<00:03:43.880> the<00:03:44.000> focus<00:03:44.390> using

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
more normal tweak the focus using

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.650 
more normal tweak the focus using
fingers<00:03:45.830> rather<00:03:46.370> than<00:03:46.730> actually<00:03:47.210> touching

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
fingers rather than actually touching

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.150 
fingers rather than actually touching
the<00:03:47.690> screen<00:03:49.000> so<00:03:50.000> when<00:03:50.270> you're<00:03:50.600> so<00:03:51.230> so<00:03:51.950> when

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
the screen so when you're so so when

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.800 
the screen so when you're so so when
you're<00:03:52.280> trusting<00:03:52.760> the<00:03:52.910> autofocus<00:03:53.300> to<00:03:53.570> do<00:03:53.690> the

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
you're trusting the autofocus to do the

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.350 
you're trusting the autofocus to do the
job<00:03:54.020> for<00:03:54.050> you<00:03:54.350> you<00:03:54.620> are<00:03:54.830> not<00:03:55.070> in<00:03:55.280> control<00:03:55.550> the

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
job for you you are not in control the

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.720 
job for you you are not in control the
cameras<00:03:56.870> microprocessor<00:03:57.560> is<00:03:57.770> on<00:03:57.920> in<00:03:58.160> control

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
cameras microprocessor is on in control

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.000 
cameras microprocessor is on in control
so<00:03:59.150> when<00:03:59.450> you're<00:03:59.570> shooting<00:03:59.810> a<00:03:59.870> video<00:04:00.050> what<00:04:00.890> you

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
so when you're shooting a video what you

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.540 
so when you're shooting a video what you
want<00:04:01.220> is<00:04:01.400> actually<00:04:01.790> full<00:04:02.230> manual<00:04:03.230> control<00:04:03.550> so

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
want is actually full manual control so

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.900 
want is actually full manual control so
that's<00:04:04.970> why<00:04:05.270> I<00:04:05.510> still<00:04:06.080> go<00:04:06.800> for<00:04:07.130> manual<00:04:07.490> focus

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
that's why I still go for manual focus

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.780 
that's why I still go for manual focus
and<00:04:08.180> one<00:04:08.930> more<00:04:09.080> thing<00:04:09.260> about<00:04:09.320> the<00:04:09.620> EOS<00:04:09.920> 70d<00:04:10.190> AF

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
and one more thing about the EOS 70d AF

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.440 
and one more thing about the EOS 70d AF
system<00:04:11.000> that<00:04:11.360> is<00:04:11.630> the<00:04:12.080> AF<00:04:12.770> area<00:04:13.310> is<00:04:13.490> simply<00:04:14.120> too

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
system that is the AF area is simply too

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.289 
system that is the AF area is simply too
big<00:04:14.900> if<00:04:15.350> you<00:04:15.470> have<00:04:15.560> a<00:04:15.620> movie<00:04:15.830> servo<00:04:16.250> AF<00:04:16.820> mode

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
big if you have a movie servo AF mode

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.020 
big if you have a movie servo AF mode
you<00:04:17.660> can<00:04:17.750> see<00:04:18.140> the<00:04:18.620> active<00:04:19.220> focus<00:04:19.730> area<00:04:19.970> is

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
you can see the active focus area is

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.800 
you can see the active focus area is
inside<00:04:20.690> that<00:04:21.080> square<00:04:21.500> box<00:04:21.890> there<00:04:22.610> so<00:04:22.940> that

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
inside that square box there so that

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.630 
inside that square box there so that
square<00:04:24.110> box<00:04:24.320> is<00:04:24.500> actually<00:04:24.860> pretty<00:04:25.040> big<00:04:25.340> so

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
square box is actually pretty big so

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.180 
square box is actually pretty big so
what<00:04:25.820> if<00:04:26.120> you<00:04:26.540> want<00:04:26.690> to<00:04:26.780> focus<00:04:26.960> on<00:04:27.290> a<00:04:27.650> small

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
what if you want to focus on a small

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.060 
what if you want to focus on a small
subject<00:04:29.180> there's<00:04:29.570> something<00:04:29.900> small<00:04:30.440> and<00:04:31.010> you

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
subject there's something small and you

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.070 
subject there's something small and you
want<00:04:31.220> to<00:04:31.280> pinpoint<00:04:31.550> focus<00:04:32.330> on<00:04:32.510> that<00:04:32.660> small

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
want to pinpoint focus on that small

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.860 
want to pinpoint focus on that small
subject<00:04:33.740> and<00:04:33.919> it<00:04:34.190> doesn't<00:04:34.580> fill<00:04:34.970> the<00:04:35.510> huge

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
subject and it doesn't fill the huge

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.620 
subject and it doesn't fill the huge
white<00:04:36.380> box<00:04:37.100> what<00:04:37.550> are<00:04:37.610> you<00:04:37.669> gonna<00:04:37.760> do<00:04:37.970> so<00:04:38.419> it

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
white box what are you gonna do so it

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.960 
white box what are you gonna do so it
simply<00:04:38.930> doesn't<00:04:39.110> work<00:04:39.470> and<00:04:39.830> for<00:04:40.430> some<00:04:40.580> very

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
simply doesn't work and for some very

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.750 
simply doesn't work and for some very
fast<00:04:41.330> action<00:04:41.600> the<00:04:42.380> auto<00:04:42.740> focus<00:04:43.040> actually

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
fast action the auto focus actually

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.030 
fast action the auto focus actually
can't<00:04:44.000> keep<00:04:44.330> up<00:04:44.600> for<00:04:45.020> example<00:04:45.410> this<00:04:45.560> shot<00:04:45.860> here

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
can't keep up for example this shot here

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.060 
can't keep up for example this shot here
I<00:04:46.190> trusted<00:04:46.760> the<00:04:47.240> autofocus<00:04:47.720> to<00:04:48.110> work<00:04:48.410> for<00:04:48.830> me

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
I trusted the autofocus to work for me

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.220 
I trusted the autofocus to work for me
and<00:04:49.310> as<00:04:50.030> you<00:04:50.150> can<00:04:50.240> see<00:04:50.450> although<00:04:50.630> avec<00:04:51.020> it

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
and as you can see although avec it

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.860 
and as you can see although avec it
eventually<00:04:51.800> got<00:04:52.190> focused<00:04:52.700> but<00:04:53.210> still<00:04:53.480> it<00:04:53.690> was

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
eventually got focused but still it was

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.980 
eventually got focused but still it was
pretty<00:04:54.020> slow<00:04:54.980> it<00:04:55.250> was<00:04:55.340> about<00:04:55.640> an<00:04:55.970> entire<00:04:56.690> half

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
pretty slow it was about an entire half

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.830 
pretty slow it was about an entire half
a<00:04:57.169> second<00:04:57.500> slow<00:04:57.770> because<00:04:58.490> if<00:04:58.850> I<00:04:59.180> did<00:04:59.540> man<00:04:59.720> you

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
a second slow because if I did man you

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.740 
a second slow because if I did man you
focus<00:05:00.230> this<00:05:00.919> shot<00:05:01.220> would<00:05:01.580> have<00:05:01.700> been<00:05:01.880> good<00:05:02.120> but

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
focus this shot would have been good but

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.500 
focus this shot would have been good but
soon<00:05:02.930> auto<00:05:03.260> focus<00:05:03.830> was

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
soon auto focus was

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.680 
soon auto focus was
or<00:05:04.570> to<00:05:04.900> actually<00:05:05.080> get<00:05:06.040> the<00:05:06.580> focus<00:05:06.940> that<00:05:06.970> I<00:05:07.300> want

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
or to actually get the focus that I want

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.360 
or to actually get the focus that I want
so<00:05:08.200> what<00:05:08.380> this<00:05:08.500> show<00:05:08.680> I<00:05:08.710> couldn't<00:05:09.100> actually

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
so what this show I couldn't actually

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.010 
so what this show I couldn't actually
matter<00:05:09.550> focus<00:05:09.850> myself<00:05:10.210> because<00:05:10.480> both<00:05:10.720> of<00:05:10.870> my

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
matter focus myself because both of my

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.440 
matter focus myself because both of my
hands<00:05:11.290> will<00:05:11.500> occupy<00:05:11.800> occupy<00:05:12.550> were<00:05:13.180> occupied

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
hands will occupy occupy were occupied

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.650 
hands will occupy occupy were occupied
operating<00:05:14.200> the<00:05:14.380> mic<00:05:14.680> room<00:05:15.130> hole<00:05:15.430> so<00:05:16.000> I<00:05:16.030> had<00:05:16.420> to

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
operating the mic room hole so I had to

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.320 
operating the mic room hole so I had to
use<00:05:16.840> autofocus<00:05:17.650> but<00:05:18.160> still<00:05:18.430> I'm<00:05:18.700> using<00:05:18.940> a

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
use autofocus but still I'm using a

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.350 
use autofocus but still I'm using a
glidecam<00:05:20.260> and<00:05:20.620> both<00:05:21.340> of<00:05:21.370> my<00:05:21.610> hands<00:05:21.910> have<00:05:22.150> to<00:05:22.330> be

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
glidecam and both of my hands have to be

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.140 
glidecam and both of my hands have to be
on<00:05:22.900> the<00:05:23.380> glidecam<00:05:23.830> to<00:05:24.100> actually<00:05:24.550> maneuver<00:05:24.850> the

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
on the glidecam to actually maneuver the

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.050 
on the glidecam to actually maneuver the
glidecam<00:05:25.540> and<00:05:25.780> I'm<00:05:26.440> on<00:05:26.740> a<00:05:26.770> wide-angle<00:05:27.190> lens<00:05:27.550> so

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
glidecam and I'm on a wide-angle lens so

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.970 
glidecam and I'm on a wide-angle lens so
I<00:05:28.090> have<00:05:28.330> plenty<00:05:28.510> of<00:05:28.690> depth<00:05:28.960> of<00:05:29.050> field<00:05:29.320> I<00:05:29.560> don't

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:29.980 
I have plenty of depth of field I don't

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.920 
I have plenty of depth of field I don't
need<00:05:30.100> to<00:05:30.190> worry<00:05:30.400> too<00:05:30.700> much<00:05:30.730> about<00:05:31.000> focus<00:05:31.690> then

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
need to worry too much about focus then

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.050 
need to worry too much about focus then
I<00:05:32.080> might<00:05:32.290> actually<00:05:32.500> consider<00:05:33.160> leaving<00:05:33.850> the

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
I might actually consider leaving the

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.280 
I might actually consider leaving the
camera<00:05:34.420> on<00:05:34.780> servo<00:05:35.260> AF<00:05:35.890> mode<00:05:36.160> so<00:05:37.290> because

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:38.290 
camera on servo AF mode so because

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:39.900 
camera on servo AF mode so because
obviously<00:05:38.530> I<00:05:38.830> don't<00:05:39.130> have<00:05:39.280> a<00:05:39.310> secondary<00:05:39.730> focus

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:39.910 
obviously I don't have a secondary focus

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.820 
obviously I don't have a secondary focus
pull<00:05:40.240> pull<00:05:40.720> focus<00:05:40.930> for<00:05:41.290> me<00:05:41.440> while<00:05:41.650> I'm

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
pull pull focus for me while I'm

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.130 
pull pull focus for me while I'm
actually<00:05:42.040> using<00:05:42.340> a<00:05:42.550> glide<00:05:42.790> cam<00:05:42.970> so<00:05:43.420> that<00:05:43.690> would

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:44.140 
actually using a glide cam so that would

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.370 
actually using a glide cam so that would
be<00:05:44.320> a<00:05:44.500> wonderful<00:05:44.830> option<00:05:45.430> so<00:05:45.970> still<00:05:46.380> despite

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
be a wonderful option so still despite

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.640 
be a wonderful option so still despite
having<00:05:47.530> a<00:05:47.710> great<00:05:48.040> AF<00:05:48.700> system<00:05:48.970> on<00:05:49.330> the<00:05:49.840> EOS<00:05:50.290> 70d

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
having a great AF system on the EOS 70d

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.290 
having a great AF system on the EOS 70d
which<00:05:50.950> is<00:05:51.040> my<00:05:51.220> main<00:05:51.430> camera<00:05:51.670> which<00:05:51.970> I<00:05:52.060> shoot<00:05:52.270> a

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
which is my main camera which I shoot a

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.460 
which is my main camera which I shoot a
video<00:05:52.510> on<00:05:52.690> um<00:05:53.160> I<00:05:54.160> still<00:05:54.940> prefer<00:05:55.360> to<00:05:55.390> use<00:05:55.900> manual

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
video on um I still prefer to use manual

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:59.580 
video on um I still prefer to use manual
focus<00:05:57.120> again<00:05:58.120> it's<00:05:58.330> a<00:05:58.420> pretty<00:05:58.720> personal<00:05:59.320> thing

00:05:59.580 --> 00:05:59.590 
focus again it's a pretty personal thing

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.950 
focus again it's a pretty personal thing
it's<00:06:00.190> pretty<00:06:00.610> much<00:06:00.790> a<00:06:00.850> personal<00:06:01.300> preference<00:06:01.510> I

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
it's pretty much a personal preference I

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.290 
it's pretty much a personal preference I
prefer<00:06:01.990> manual<00:06:02.980> focus<00:06:03.370> and<00:06:03.670> I'm<00:06:03.790> not<00:06:03.970> saying

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.300 
prefer manual focus and I'm not saying

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.230 
prefer manual focus and I'm not saying
you<00:06:04.480> shouldn't<00:06:04.840> use<00:06:05.230> the<00:06:05.890> AF<00:06:06.460> on<00:06:06.700> the<00:06:06.820> EOS<00:06:06.940> 70d

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 
you shouldn't use the AF on the EOS 70d

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.290 
you shouldn't use the AF on the EOS 70d
because<00:06:07.810> still<00:06:08.050> it<00:06:08.290> is<00:06:08.500> pretty<00:06:09.490> good<00:06:09.880> it's

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 
because still it is pretty good it's

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.210 
because still it is pretty good it's
still<00:06:10.450> very<00:06:10.840> good<00:06:11.050> it's<00:06:11.320> completely<00:06:11.920> usable

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:12.220 
still very good it's completely usable
