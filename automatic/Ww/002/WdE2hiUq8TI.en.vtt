00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.490
 hello my case I start this 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.469
 week to ask how did I do 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.679
 I 'm in water for my two bays 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.679
 curtain 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.010
 and 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.710
 in the spring at my cottage I store 3 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.290
 barrido also support but beautiful 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.840
 curtains in sales came from the crash 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:41.440
 with the years the barrels have crushed his 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.839
 two by 6 this year to make them 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.870
 live do them as it says 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:47.260
 it's barry I start by drawing myself 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.120
 a plan 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.800
 it is much more beautiful when to take shape 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.559
 with coloring pencils of all 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.430
 kinds of colors 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.019
 I cut the four by four of 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.309
 the old support to their new 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:02.229
 length when I finish cutting some 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.799
 four-legged I mark the location of 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:04.799
 all mortals 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.510
 I am talking about generators 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.640
 because I thank all the flocks 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.840
 mortals with my person the column 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.840
 that I keep to my cat d 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.360
 like the wick of a sudden this father small 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.619
 Cape park is full of stab 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.930
 small or through troops I 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.140
 done to know to the breakthroughs on the 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.140
 opposite 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.170
 but my claim I must finish the 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.170
 holes with a hand drill 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:51.140
 now is the time to finish 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:53.600
 deadly with hungry wood chisels 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.400
 I have to pick up the chips it myself 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.450
 gives a full grocery bag for 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:01.100
 leave my brother in the fall now 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.540
 it's time to cut two courses 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.540
 the two by four to good length 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.180
 these two everywhere 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:16.940
 the couple is a name with a small 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:18.170
 band saw that I keep at the cottage I 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.550
 not been able to pay two by 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.070
 four with the small band saw 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.940
 I am using dado in the band if I 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.940
 cut the detonating side 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:34.440
 on two of the pieces I have to cut a 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.440
 amazing end I go back to servins 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.630
 this is where my only blade breaks I do 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:48.970
 as staged did I do not need 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:51.100
 not the likes and now that all 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.930
 pieces game seems of support e century 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.930
 then I mark or go each piece 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.040
 I'm losing sainton through every 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.040
 dead times 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.930
 there every morning I mix thonon 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:11.090
 correspondents and I'm doing a little 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:13.520
 mark with a wick to better see it 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.890
 I'm alive only on the mark and I 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.610
 perceive a hole in the barrel 1/8 more 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.610
 near the shoulder hand 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.720
 now I'm doing hair in 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.780
 cutting remnants of wood floors 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.780
 franc 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.030
 towards peace side to round them 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.810
 as I did not use tools 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.060
 electrical 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.630
 I had visits I tried to 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.340
 present but without success I preferred 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.640
 to be left alone to fight so the 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.640
 black flies 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.800
 it's time for the sport assembly 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.630
 and thanks for the construction glue 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.090
 when we make joints as bad as 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.040
 what I did this glue there becomes 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.940
 our best friend 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:13.750
 remains more than pushing the ankles 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:15.550
 in the holes still my best friend 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.060
 on the long side and when everything is 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.560
 assembled 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:24.760
 you have to put the ankles in all 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:26.860
 the holes now that the sport is 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.050
 finished I cut the pieces that go to me 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.320
 serve as a platform that will retain the 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.320
 Paris 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.200
 and I am not 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.900
 now is the time to prepare the 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.680
 new space opens with support I 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.050
 start by cutting a tree 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.220
 unwanted it's fun to cut a 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.650
 tree without a municipal permit 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.390
 I lead pockets of sand for us 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.930
 the patio slabs that I 'm going to put 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.930
 under the legs 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.420
 when slabs his level I bring the 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.730
 support replaces with the help of my 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.500
 wife i'm a little finished at the schl 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:25.250
 Ladies level after the support 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:28.430
 is in place it's the time needed 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.660
 the ball to the leap and bari I perceive 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:39.710
 all these groups intend to oppose 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:41.860
 between and after I make a map of 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.950
 tanks by the hole that I come to do 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:49.940
 but glue it's spinning the connection 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:52.220
 and I put it in the barrel with the mcr 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:57.800
 fields in the barrel agreement then I 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:06:01.850
 the glue I have more than wait 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.770
 the glue dries all the next night 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:07.300
 morning I put teflon frail from the 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.300
 fitting and I saw the wave 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:24.390
 these times to put the barry suspense and 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:24.390
 fill them with water that comes from my well 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:33.660
 here is my new water bari support 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.660
 in full wood in montchanin 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:41.460
 thank you to the next for another 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.460
 episode of the mess of boer
