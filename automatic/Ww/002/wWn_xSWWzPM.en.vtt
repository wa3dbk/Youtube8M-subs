the<00:05:39.159> successes<00:05:39.729> that<00:05:39.879> we've<00:05:40.030> had<00:05:40.060> in<00:05:40.629> how<00:05:40.840> they

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
the successes that we've had in how they

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.869 
the successes that we've had in how they
can<00:05:41.889> serve<00:05:42.639> as<00:05:43.030> an<00:05:43.539> example<00:05:44.169> because<00:05:44.439> if<00:05:44.979> we

00:05:45.869 --> 00:05:45.879 
can serve as an example because if we

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:49.890 
can serve as an example because if we
don't<00:05:46.259> organize<00:05:47.259> if<00:05:47.800> we<00:05:48.159> don't<00:05:48.490> set<00:05:49.479> a<00:05:49.509> clear

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
don't organize if we don't set a clear

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.059 
don't organize if we don't set a clear
agenda<00:05:50.050> if<00:05:50.560> you<00:05:50.650> don't<00:05:50.830> communicate

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:51.069 
agenda if you don't communicate

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:53.459 
agenda if you don't communicate
effectively<00:05:51.699> if<00:05:52.509> we<00:05:52.689> don't<00:05:52.930> get<00:05:53.050> into<00:05:53.229> that

00:05:53.459 --> 00:05:53.469 
effectively if we don't get into that

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:56.159 
effectively if we don't get into that
discussion<00:05:53.800> then<00:05:54.759> we'll<00:05:55.180> not<00:05:55.330> get<00:05:55.810> anywhere

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:56.169 
discussion then we'll not get anywhere

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:58.980 
discussion then we'll not get anywhere
so<00:05:56.349> it's<00:05:56.500> critical<00:05:57.159> that<00:05:57.400> you<00:05:58.300> go<00:05:58.539> into<00:05:58.870> that

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
so it's critical that you go into that

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.640 
so it's critical that you go into that
discussion<00:05:59.469> and<00:05:59.830> start<00:06:00.069> saying<00:06:00.870> yes<00:06:01.870> that's

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
discussion and start saying yes that's

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:03.899 
discussion and start saying yes that's
what<00:06:02.860> you<00:06:03.009> need<00:06:03.219> you<00:06:03.370> need<00:06:03.520> to<00:06:03.639> have<00:06:03.729> proper

00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:03.909 
what you need you need to have proper

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:06.029 
what you need you need to have proper
school<00:06:04.270> infrastructure<00:06:04.900> and<00:06:05.110> this<00:06:05.560> is<00:06:05.770> how<00:06:05.979> we

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:06.039 
school infrastructure and this is how we

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:09.750 
school infrastructure and this is how we
should<00:06:06.370> start<00:06:06.939> going<00:06:07.270> about<00:06:07.539> it
