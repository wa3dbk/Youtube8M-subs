00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.740
 today's program is devoted to the arc a genre that many fear for their 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.440
 aggression that is often confused with an apology for violence after lending 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.299
 I support enough attention to your lyrics full of social content and find 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:16.439
 things like repressive governments military forces 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:18.300
 and against the current in general 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.689
 they have even been against the violence that used to be generated in their 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.660
 own concerts that is why they have dedicated their philosophy to what they call 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.180
 positive alcohol and that there is no pending and his song beyond the lie 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.540
 It seems that someone called me to 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.090
 I am the good shepherd 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.290
 but the Dutch the drummer 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.400
 yes military ardoz 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.330
 and if they were done along with their daughters 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.330
 and we are more dependent 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.910
 as in that answer he asserted that even the days we what 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.950
 we try is 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.020
 all the corruption and 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.020
 and the whole city of maracay 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.340
 independent is like them 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.220
 so in the beginning 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.039
 these encounters 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:34.039
 but already today in that proportional way 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.600
 legends like 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.580
 there's also I do not know why because it was that 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:51.439
 the costs are 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:52.470
 greatly reduces 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.930
 100% when 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.610
 I feel in debt 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.380
 a common good 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.750
 that's why worried about the tide 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.790
 of them was excellent 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.790
 they do not know either 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:11.089
 we give it all our first video 

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:14.009
 to his part the actor renÃ© favaloro 

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:15.869
 the pain that was the dreams 

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:16.699
 we would have people beyond
