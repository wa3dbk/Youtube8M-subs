00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
they get terrible scars if you do it all

they get terrible scars if you do it all
at<00:04:07.310> once<00:04:07.519> and<00:04:07.819> so<00:04:08.329> in<00:04:08.540> animals<00:04:09.260> they've<00:04:09.590> been

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
at once and so in animals they've been

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:11.319 
at once and so in animals they've been
doing<00:04:10.100> it<00:04:10.250> where<00:04:10.430> they'll<00:04:10.609> do<00:04:10.790> like<00:04:10.970> thirty

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
doing it where they'll do like thirty

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:14.450 
doing it where they'll do like thirty
three<00:04:11.630> percent<00:04:11.709> let<00:04:12.709> the<00:04:12.859> animal<00:04:13.340> he'll<00:04:13.730> come

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
three percent let the animal he'll come

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.250 
three percent let the animal he'll come
up<00:04:14.520> to<00:04:14.700> another<00:04:14.970> thirty<00:04:15.360> three<00:04:15.690> percent<00:04:15.720> let

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
up to another thirty three percent let

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.230 
up to another thirty three percent let
the<00:04:16.350> animal<00:04:16.770> heal<00:04:16.980> etc<00:04:17.790> and<00:04:17.850> they're<00:04:18.000> still

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:18.240 
the animal heal etc and they're still

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.930 
the animal heal etc and they're still
having<00:04:18.480> tremendous<00:04:19.040> stricture<00:04:20.040> rates<00:04:20.250> so<00:04:20.880> is

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
having tremendous stricture rates so is

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.100 
having tremendous stricture rates so is
this<00:04:21.090> a<00:04:21.120> little<00:04:21.300> bit<00:04:21.510> of<00:04:21.540> a<00:04:21.690> surprise<00:04:21.840> that

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:22.110 
this a little bit of a surprise that

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.160 
this a little bit of a surprise that
they<00:04:22.560> went<00:04:22.950> right<00:04:23.190> into<00:04:23.370> humans<00:04:23.970> at<00:04:24.930> this

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.170 
they went right into humans at this

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.350 
they went right into humans at this
other<00:04:25.380> group<00:04:25.620> it's<00:04:26.040> right<00:04:26.220> and<00:04:26.790> you<00:04:26.970> see<00:04:27.180> that

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
other group it's right and you see that

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.210 
other group it's right and you see that
it's<00:04:27.510> twenty-nine<00:04:28.080> percent<00:04:28.290> with<00:04:28.710> strictures

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
it's twenty-nine percent with strictures

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.250 
it's twenty-nine percent with strictures
so<00:04:29.730> I<00:04:29.760> guess<00:04:29.940> we<00:04:30.060> shouldn't<00:04:30.330> be<00:04:30.390> surprised<00:04:30.900> I

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
so I guess we shouldn't be surprised I

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.560 
so I guess we shouldn't be surprised I
think<00:04:31.650> for<00:04:32.130> the<00:04:32.220> average<00:04:32.370> gas<00:04:32.910> around<00:04:33.240> is<00:04:33.540> to

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
think for the average gas around is to

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.350 
think for the average gas around is to
uvm<00:04:34.110> are<00:04:34.320> complete<00:04:34.980> removal<00:04:35.340> of<00:04:35.700> Barrett's

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
uvm are complete removal of Barrett's

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.330 
uvm are complete removal of Barrett's
being<00:04:36.660> EMR<00:04:37.080> I<00:04:37.290> think<00:04:37.560> it's<00:04:37.680> technically<00:04:38.130> very

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
being EMR I think it's technically very

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.120 
being EMR I think it's technically very
difficult<00:04:38.910> potentially<00:04:39.630> dangerous<00:04:40.130> dr.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
difficult potentially dangerous dr.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
would never do that in the community

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.850 
would never do that in the community
because<00:04:50.640> you<00:04:50.940> need<00:04:51.240> to<00:04:51.270> have<00:04:51.690> enough<00:04:52.290> patience

because you need to have enough patience

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.040 
because you need to have enough patience
you<00:04:53.010> need<00:04:53.160> to<00:04:53.250> have<00:04:53.370> enough<00:04:53.610> skills<00:04:53.970> there<00:04:54.930> are

you need to have enough skills there are

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.970 
you need to have enough skills there are
a<00:04:55.110> lot<00:04:55.230> of<00:04:55.260> things<00:04:55.470> going<00:04:55.740> on<00:04:55.830> in

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
a lot of things going on in

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.890 
a lot of things going on in

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
gastroenterology now that you need to

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.280 
gastroenterology now that you need to
have<00:04:58.110> enough<00:04:59.070> background<00:04:59.400> in<00:04:59.910> to<00:05:00.180> not<00:05:00.360> to<00:05:00.960> do

have enough background in to not to do

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.340 
have enough background in to not to do
it<00:05:01.410> successfully<00:05:01.940> so<00:05:02.940> I<00:05:03.330> would<00:05:03.990> be<00:05:04.110> by<00:05:04.260> up

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
it successfully so I would be by up

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.230 
it successfully so I would be by up
seeing<00:05:04.590> my<00:05:04.710> patients<00:05:04.890> with<00:05:05.220> reflux<00:05:05.610> to<00:05:05.910> see<00:05:06.120> if

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
seeing my patients with reflux to see if

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.370 
seeing my patients with reflux to see if
they<00:05:06.390> have<00:05:06.510> Barrett's<00:05:06.900> in<00:05:07.020> high-grade

they have Barrett's in high-grade

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.140 
they have Barrett's in high-grade
dysplasia<00:05:07.740> and<00:05:07.890> then<00:05:08.070> I<00:05:08.100> would<00:05:08.280> send<00:05:08.550> them<00:05:08.730> to

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
dysplasia and then I would send them to

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.390 
dysplasia and then I would send them to
one<00:05:09.270> of<00:05:09.360> my<00:05:09.450> friendly<00:05:09.780> esophagus<00:05:10.710> who<00:05:11.280> would

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
one of my friendly esophagus who would

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.670 
one of my friendly esophagus who would
then<00:05:11.520> determine<00:05:12.000> what<00:05:12.390> is<00:05:12.600> looking<00:05:13.050> best<00:05:13.350> in

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
then determine what is looking best in

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.160 
then determine what is looking best in
terms<00:05:14.370> of<00:05:14.640> our<00:05:14.760> science<00:05:14.790> right<00:05:15.480> now<00:05:15.690> because

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.170 
terms of our science right now because

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:17.930 
terms of our science right now because
science<00:05:16.530> is<00:05:16.620> changing<00:05:17.040> so<00:05:17.070> rapidly<00:05:17.250> in<00:05:17.790> this

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
science is changing so rapidly in this

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.180 
science is changing so rapidly in this
field<00:05:18.180> but<00:05:19.020> the<00:05:19.080> panelists<00:05:19.590> all<00:05:19.770> gave<00:05:19.980> high

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
field but the panelists all gave high

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.060 
field but the panelists all gave high
marks<00:05:20.490> to<00:05:20.640> EMR<00:05:21.090> as<00:05:21.330> the<00:05:21.510> way<00:05:21.600> forward<00:05:22.110> dr.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
marks to EMR as the way forward dr.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.370 
marks to EMR as the way forward dr.
Raymond<00:05:23.400> again<00:05:23.610> it<00:05:24.390> looks<00:05:24.420> like<00:05:24.660> a<00:05:24.720> very<00:05:24.960> good

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
Raymond again it looks like a very good

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.740 
Raymond again it looks like a very good
way<00:05:25.560> to<00:05:25.590> avoid<00:05:26.160> in<00:05:26.400> many<00:05:26.580> patients<00:05:26.880> that

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
way to avoid in many patients that

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.530 
way to avoid in many patients that
