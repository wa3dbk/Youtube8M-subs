guess<00:01:30.509> that's<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.840> timeout<00:01:31.079> issue<00:01:31.350> but<00:01:31.740> not<00:01:32.100> a

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
guess that's a timeout issue but not a

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.859 
guess that's a timeout issue but not a
big<00:01:32.310> deal<00:01:32.430> as<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.240> can<00:01:33.329> see<00:01:33.479> they're<00:01:33.659> very

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
able to hear it because I've got it

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.060

audio is going to my desktop probably

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.620

will work that out in the long run but

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.660 
will work that out in the long run but
for<00:02:00.899> now<00:02:00.990> we'll<00:02:01.320> just<00:02:01.350> I'll<00:02:02.159> deal<00:02:02.340> with<00:02:02.369> not

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
for now we'll just I'll deal with not

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.850 
for now we'll just I'll deal with not
being<00:02:02.880> able<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.149> hear<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.450> whoo-whoo<00:02:03.869> over

being able to hear the whoo-whoo over
and<00:02:04.979> over<00:02:05.070> again<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.670> will<00:02:06.270> say<00:02:06.420> that's<00:02:06.570> the

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
and over again I will say that's the

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.240 
and over again I will say that's the
most<00:02:06.899> obnoxious<00:02:07.110> thing<00:02:07.469> about<00:02:07.740> this<00:02:07.890> game<00:02:08.069> in

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
most obnoxious thing about this game in

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.639 
most obnoxious thing about this game in
particular<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:08.910> it's<00:02:09.119> just<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:10.080> exact<00:02:10.440> same

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
particular is it's just the exact same

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.320 
particular is it's just the exact same
sound<00:02:10.890> over<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.280> over<00:02:11.370> you've<00:02:11.940> got<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.120> really

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
sound over and over you've got a really

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.190 
sound over and over you've got a really
nice

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
nice

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.550 
nice
score<00:02:14.040> but<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.300> actual<00:02:15.450> voice<00:02:16.050> acting

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
score but the the actual voice acting

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.979 
score but the the actual voice acting
was<00:02:17.040> limited<00:02:17.670> apparently<00:02:18.090> because<00:02:18.269> exact

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
was limited apparently because exact

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.300 
was limited apparently because exact
same<00:02:19.470> sounds<00:02:20.340> again<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:20.940> again<00:02:21.239> can<00:02:22.160> you<00:02:23.160> see

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
same sounds again and again can you see

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.770 
same sounds again and again can you see
there<00:02:23.459> i'm<00:02:23.550> sort<00:02:23.819> of<00:02:23.849> button<00:02:24.090> mashing<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:24.569> kill

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
there i'm sort of button mashing to kill

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.229 
there i'm sort of button mashing to kill
this<00:02:25.379> that<00:02:25.620> in<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:25.769> other<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.819> first<00:02:27.030> time<00:02:27.209> I

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
this that in the other the first time I

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.850 
this that in the other the first time I
played<00:02:27.360> this<00:02:27.540> through<00:02:28.019> I<00:02:28.050> actually<00:02:28.440> ran

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
played this through I actually ran

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.949 
played this through I actually ran
straight<00:02:29.250> into<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.640> group<00:02:29.880> ahead<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.480> that

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
straight into the group ahead and that

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.870 
straight into the group ahead and that
was<00:02:31.080> a<00:02:31.110> bad<00:02:31.319> idea<00:02:31.349> but<00:02:32.160> I<00:02:32.220> figured<00:02:32.459> out<00:02:32.580> if<00:02:32.730> you

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
was a bad idea but I figured out if you

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.390 
was a bad idea but I figured out if you
pull<00:02:33.480> just<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.720> couple<00:02:33.930> of<00:02:34.050> them<00:02:34.170> at<00:02:34.230> a<00:02:34.260> time<00:02:34.500> you

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
pull just a couple of them at a time you

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.650 
pull just a couple of them at a time you
can<00:02:35.550> generally<00:02:35.819> take<00:02:36.060> them<00:02:36.180> out<00:02:36.269> pretty<00:02:36.420> fast

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
can generally take them out pretty fast

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.470 
can generally take them out pretty fast
like<00:02:37.019> i'll<00:02:37.290> hit<00:02:37.440> X<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.640> do<00:02:38.730> this<00:02:38.940> and<00:02:39.000> that'll

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
like i'll hit X and do this and that'll

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.770 
like i'll hit X and do this and that'll
take<00:02:39.599> those<00:02:39.780> all<00:02:39.959> down<00:02:40.140> i'll<00:02:40.769> hit<00:02:40.950> Y<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:41.780> big

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
take those all down i'll hit Y and big

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.110 
take those all down i'll hit Y and big
smack<00:02:43.080> across<00:02:43.319> most<00:02:43.680> of<00:02:43.860> them<00:02:44.069> yeah<00:02:44.940> I'm<00:02:45.030> not

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
smack across most of them yeah I'm not

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.539 
smack across most of them yeah I'm not
taking<00:02:45.450> any<00:02:45.870> damage<00:02:46.080> at<00:02:46.349> this<00:02:46.470> point<00:02:46.709> and<00:02:46.950> it's

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
taking any damage at this point and it's

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:48.740 
taking any damage at this point and it's
set<00:02:47.700> up<00:02:47.730> in<00:02:47.910> such<00:02:47.940> a<00:02:48.090> way<00:02:48.269> that<00:02:48.299> you<00:02:48.450> heal

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750

they<00:03:10.049> are<00:03:10.670> shake<00:03:11.670> this<00:03:11.790> one<00:03:12.000> little<00:03:12.120> guy<00:03:12.329> down

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
they are shake this one little guy down

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.620 
they are shake this one little guy down
so<00:03:14.069> yeah<00:03:14.220> realistically<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:14.940> game<00:03:15.120> it's<00:03:15.540> a

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
so yeah realistically the game it's a

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.340 
so yeah realistically the game it's a
little<00:03:15.840> repetitive<00:03:16.110> a<00:03:16.829> lot<00:03:17.340> of<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.549> same<00:03:17.760> but

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
little repetitive a lot of the same but

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.930 
little repetitive a lot of the same but
it's<00:03:19.350> it's<00:03:19.739> sort<00:03:19.980> of<00:03:20.069> mindless<00:03:20.489> fun<00:03:20.670> and<00:03:20.910> I

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
it's it's sort of mindless fun and I

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.050 
it's it's sort of mindless fun and I
like<00:03:21.120> that<00:03:21.420> and<00:03:22.340> for<00:03:23.340> showing<00:03:23.489> off<00:03:23.730> what<00:03:23.910> the

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
like that and for showing off what the

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.000 
like that and for showing off what the
device<00:03:24.269> can<00:03:24.510> do<00:03:24.690> yeah<00:03:25.350> it's<00:03:25.530> got<00:03:25.620> very<00:03:25.829> nice

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
device can do yeah it's got very nice

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.650 
device can do yeah it's got very nice
graphics<00:03:26.459> I<00:03:26.609> think<00:03:26.910> there's<00:03:27.060> a<00:03:27.120> way<00:03:27.269> to<00:03:27.299> zoom

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
graphics I think there's a way to zoom

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.270 
graphics I think there's a way to zoom
in<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:27.930> out<00:03:27.989> but<00:03:28.200> I<00:03:28.260> haven't<00:03:28.319> found<00:03:28.650> it<00:03:28.980> as<00:03:29.100> far

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
in and out but I haven't found it as far

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.340 
in and out but I haven't found it as far
as<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.459> buttons<00:03:29.700> are<00:03:29.819> concerned<00:03:30.260> what's<00:03:31.260> that

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
as the buttons are concerned what's that

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.640 
as the buttons are concerned what's that
oh<00:03:31.739> did<00:03:32.579> something<00:03:32.970> there<00:03:33.230> hit<00:03:34.230> a<00:03:34.260> button<00:03:34.470> and

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
oh did something there hit a button and

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.309 
oh did something there hit a button and
grabbed<00:03:34.950> but<00:03:35.850> anyway<00:03:36.209> I'm<00:03:36.870> definitely<00:03:37.049> having

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
grabbed but anyway I'm definitely having

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:38.360 
grabbed but anyway I'm definitely having
much<00:03:37.530> more<00:03:37.560> luck<00:03:37.859> with<00:03:37.889> this<00:03:38.100> then<00:03:38.250> I<00:03:38.310> the

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
much more luck with this then I the

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.610 
much more luck with this then I the
first<00:03:38.700> few<00:03:38.819> times<00:03:38.970> up<00:03:39.180> late<00:03:39.329> it<00:03:39.420> through<00:03:39.620> I'd

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
first few times up late it through I'd

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.020 
first few times up late it through I'd
haven't<00:03:40.920> played<00:03:41.130> very<00:03:41.370> far<00:03:41.579> into<00:03:41.730> it<00:03:41.850> though

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
haven't played very far into it though

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.819 
haven't played very far into it though
I'll<00:03:42.180> just<00:03:42.329> sort<00:03:42.720> of<00:03:42.750> remind<00:03:43.049> you<00:03:43.109> there<00:03:43.290> oh<00:03:43.470> no

I'll just sort of remind you there oh no
lots<00:03:44.160> of<00:03:44.280> bad<00:03:44.459> guys<00:03:44.670> are<00:03:44.850> coming<00:03:45.180> I<00:03:45.359> guess<00:03:45.660> what

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
lots of bad guys are coming I guess what

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.680 
lots of bad guys are coming I guess what
we're<00:03:45.930> gonna<00:03:45.989> use<00:03:46.109> our<00:03:46.290> big<00:03:46.440> attack<00:03:46.739> shop<00:03:47.690> and

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
we're gonna use our big attack shop and

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.199 
we're gonna use our big attack shop and
there<00:03:48.870> they<00:03:48.989> all<00:03:49.109> go<00:03:49.350> one<00:03:50.010> hit<00:03:50.310> everybody<00:03:51.030> goes

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
there they all go one hit everybody goes

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.140 
there they all go one hit everybody goes
down<00:03:51.920> then<00:03:52.920> there's<00:03:53.100> these<00:03:53.400> other<00:03:53.639> guys<00:03:53.819> left

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
down then there's these other guys left

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.390 
down then there's these other guys left
I<00:03:54.450> think<00:03:54.630> we<00:03:54.780> can<00:03:54.870> take<00:03:54.989> them<00:03:55.170> out<00:03:55.350> not<00:03:56.190> a<00:03:56.220> big

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
I think we can take them out not a big

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.660 
I think we can take them out not a big

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
balls I did not intend to pull the boss

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.490 
balls I did not intend to pull the boss
with<00:04:02.370> that<00:04:02.489> attack<00:04:02.819> but<00:04:03.120> luckily<00:04:03.840> I<00:04:04.049> can<00:04:04.319> sort

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
with that attack but luckily I can sort

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.440 
with that attack but luckily I can sort
of<00:04:04.620> move<00:04:04.709> away<00:04:04.859> for<00:04:05.010> a<00:04:05.250> few<00:04:05.400> seconds<00:04:05.819> I<00:04:06.000> don't

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
of move away for a few seconds I don't

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.740 
of move away for a few seconds I don't
think<00:04:06.630> the<00:04:06.769> o.c<00:04:07.769> that<00:04:07.920> little<00:04:08.130> button<00:04:08.489> here<00:04:08.750> if

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
think the o.c that little button here if

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.599 
think the o.c that little button here if
I<00:04:09.870> hit<00:04:10.049> that<00:04:10.079> I<00:04:10.500> turn<00:04:10.769> into<00:04:10.980> big<00:04:11.099> mammy<00:04:11.340> jamma

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
I hit that I turn into big mammy jamma

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.020 
I hit that I turn into big mammy jamma
and<00:04:11.910> then<00:04:12.000> I<00:04:12.239> could<00:04:12.389> meet<00:04:12.630> everybody<00:04:12.989> up<00:04:13.169> and

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
and then I could meet everybody up and

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.940 
and then I could meet everybody up and
that's<00:04:15.030> a<00:04:15.150> whole<00:04:15.269> lot<00:04:15.419> of<00:04:15.510> fun<00:04:15.660> and<00:04:16.620> there's

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
that's a whole lot of fun and there's

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.640 
that's a whole lot of fun and there's
apparently<00:04:17.250> some<00:04:17.519> issues<00:04:18.150> with<00:04:18.320> door<00:04:19.320> frames

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
apparently some issues with door frames

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.050 
apparently some issues with door frames
because<00:04:19.919> they<00:04:20.099> can't<00:04:20.310> seem<00:04:20.489> to<00:04:20.639> go<00:04:20.729> through

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
because they can't seem to go through

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.599 
because they can't seem to go through
them

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
them

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.129 
them
definitely<00:04:22.419> not<00:04:22.509> complaining<00:04:22.659> about<00:04:22.990> that

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
definitely not complaining about that

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:24.659 
definitely not complaining about that
because<00:04:23.560> it<00:04:23.830> gives<00:04:23.919> you<00:04:24.069> a<00:04:24.099> little<00:04:24.310> place<00:04:24.490> to

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
because it gives you a little place to

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:27.540 
because it gives you a little place to
run<00:04:24.849> off<00:04:24.969> to<00:04:25.240> and<00:04:26.080> while<00:04:26.229> I'm<00:04:26.349> in<00:04:26.469> this<00:04:26.620> big<00:04:27.310> bad

done quite a few tests and there we go I

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.550 
done quite a few tests and there we go I
only<00:04:45.789> killed<00:04:46.060> 24<00:04:46.360> to<00:04:46.539> 26<00:04:46.870> monsters<00:04:47.289> because<00:04:47.530> a

only killed 24 to 26 monsters because a

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.020 
only killed 24 to 26 monsters because a

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.089 
couple were off in the distance there
but<00:04:49.300> it<00:04:49.870> was<00:04:49.960> pretty<00:04:50.139> straightforward<00:04:50.770> not

00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:51.099 
but it was pretty straightforward not

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:52.890 
but it was pretty straightforward not
terribly<00:04:51.400> difficult<00:04:51.610> like<00:04:52.330> I<00:04:52.419> said<00:04:52.479> lots<00:04:52.780> of

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
terribly difficult like I said lots of

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.170 
terribly difficult like I said lots of
stick<00:04:53.110> moving<00:04:53.469> lots<00:04:53.620> of<00:04:53.860> button<00:04:54.610> mashing<00:04:54.639> and

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
stick moving lots of button mashing and

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.110 
stick moving lots of button mashing and
the<00:04:56.080> game<00:04:56.229> itself<00:04:56.349> is<00:04:56.740> really<00:04:57.009> not<00:04:57.189> terrible

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
the game itself is really not terrible

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.179 
the game itself is really not terrible
the<00:04:58.990> the<00:04:59.289> sound<00:04:59.529> could<00:04:59.740> use<00:04:59.889> a<00:04:59.919> little<00:05:00.099> work

00:05:00.179 --> 00:05:00.189 
the the sound could use a little work

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:02.999

blood<00:05:01.029> sword<00:05:01.330> as<00:05:01.629> it<00:05:01.810> is<00:05:01.930> oh<00:05:02.199> and<00:05:02.680> by<00:05:02.860> the<00:05:02.889> way

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:03.009

this<00:05:04.139> there<00:05:05.139> it<00:05:05.229> is<00:05:05.319> it's<00:05:05.529> actually<00:05:05.650> showing

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:05.979 
this there it is it's actually showing

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:09.330 
this there it is it's actually showing
up<00:05:06.189> on<00:05:06.340> the<00:05:06.610> capture<00:05:07.090> now<00:05:07.240> I<00:05:07.270> think<00:05:08.039> so<00:05:09.039> that

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
up on the capture now I think so that

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.300 
up on the capture now I think so that
should<00:05:09.550> be<00:05:09.639> good<00:05:10.469> but<00:05:11.469> yeah<00:05:11.560> I<00:05:11.770> haven't<00:05:12.250> played

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
should be good but yeah I haven't played

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.999 
should be good but yeah I haven't played
much<00:05:12.400> further<00:05:12.849> than<00:05:13.000> this<00:05:13.300> so<00:05:14.009> that's

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:15.009 
much further than this so that's

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:15.779 
much further than this so that's
probably<00:05:15.159> where<00:05:15.340> I'm<00:05:15.400> going<00:05:15.520> to<00:05:15.580> go<00:05:15.639> ahead<00:05:15.699> and
