different if there was not that

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.010

challenge<00:03:02.540> that<00:03:02.750> I've<00:03:02.900> been<00:03:03.110> facing<00:03:03.400> so<00:03:05.020> yeah

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
challenge that I've been facing so yeah

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.280 
challenge that I've been facing so yeah
I<00:03:06.320> suppose<00:03:07.180> everything<00:03:08.180> is<00:03:08.450> just<00:03:08.660> perfect<00:03:09.170> I

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
I suppose everything is just perfect I

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.570 
I suppose everything is just perfect I
am<00:03:09.560> well<00:03:09.860> supposed<00:03:10.640> to<00:03:10.790> be<00:03:12.070> very<00:03:13.070> obviously

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
am well supposed to be very obviously

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.870 
am well supposed to be very obviously
that's<00:03:13.910> not<00:03:14.030> in<00:03:14.360> the<00:03:14.390> saddle<00:03:14.810> right<00:03:14.989> now<00:03:15.880> even

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
that's not in the saddle right now even

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.759 
that's not in the saddle right now even
though<00:03:17.000> I<00:03:17.030> can't<00:03:17.390> wait<00:03:17.810> to<00:03:17.840> get<00:03:18.140> back<00:03:18.200> in<00:03:18.560> there

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
though I can't wait to get back in there

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.690 
though I can't wait to get back in there
so<00:03:19.610> I<00:03:20.090> have<00:03:20.720> my<00:03:20.959> bike<00:03:21.200> at<00:03:21.500> the<00:03:21.860> mechanics<00:03:22.370> again

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
so I have my bike at the mechanics again

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.240 
so I have my bike at the mechanics again
to<00:03:23.060> answer<00:03:23.420> all<00:03:23.540> those<00:03:23.660> bike<00:03:23.959> questions<00:03:24.560> so

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
to answer all those bike questions so

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.490 
to answer all those bike questions so
the<00:03:25.700> issues<00:03:26.090> that<00:03:26.120> I've<00:03:26.420> been<00:03:26.630> facing<00:03:26.959> our

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
the issues that I've been facing our

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.040 
the issues that I've been facing our
engine<00:03:28.040> issues<00:03:28.459> there<00:03:29.090> seems<00:03:29.390> to<00:03:29.480> be<00:03:29.690> some

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
engine issues there seems to be some

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.920 
engine issues there seems to be some
problem<00:03:30.800> with<00:03:31.070> the<00:03:31.100> bearings<00:03:31.670> for<00:03:32.360> the<00:03:32.510> valves

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
problem with the bearings for the valves

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.960 
problem with the bearings for the valves
that<00:03:33.140> are<00:03:33.470> not<00:03:33.830> the<00:03:33.980> right<00:03:34.160> feelings<00:03:34.670> after

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
that are not the right feelings after

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.770 
that are not the right feelings after
the<00:03:35.570> engine<00:03:36.019> has<00:03:36.170> been<00:03:36.200> customized<00:03:37.390> that<00:03:38.390> also

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
the engine has been customized that also

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.449 
the engine has been customized that also
seemed<00:03:39.019> to<00:03:39.230> cause<00:03:39.470> some<00:03:39.799> problem<00:03:40.310> with<00:03:40.430> the

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
seemed to cause some problem with the

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.720 
seemed to cause some problem with the
carburettor<00:03:41.030> or<00:03:41.780> if<00:03:42.170> it<00:03:42.320> was<00:03:42.470> not<00:03:42.799> if<00:03:43.459> that

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
carburettor or if it was not if that

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.430 
carburettor or if it was not if that
wasn't<00:03:44.090> the<00:03:44.180> cause<00:03:44.390> there<00:03:44.750> is<00:03:44.900> problems<00:03:45.350> with

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
wasn't the cause there is problems with

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.979 
wasn't the cause there is problems with
the<00:03:45.530> carburetors<00:03:46.130> which<00:03:46.730> have<00:03:47.000> been<00:03:47.180> now<00:03:47.570> sold

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
the carburetors which have been now sold

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:49.539 
the carburetors which have been now sold
the<00:03:48.380> last<00:03:48.590> time<00:03:48.890> I<00:03:48.920> had<00:03:49.130> to<00:03:49.220> bike<00:03:49.370> at<00:03:49.519> the

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
the last time I had to bike at the

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.710 
the last time I had to bike at the
mechanics<00:03:50.230> but<00:03:51.730> the<00:03:52.730> bearing<00:03:53.060> is<00:03:53.180> she<00:03:53.360> was<00:03:53.540> not

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
mechanics but the bearing is she was not

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.110 
mechanics but the bearing is she was not
solved<00:03:54.110> and<00:03:54.290> you<00:03:54.620> know<00:03:54.739> this<00:03:54.950> is<00:03:54.980> Valley<00:03:55.370> and<00:03:55.820> I

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
solved and you know this is Valley and I

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.539 
solved and you know this is Valley and I
know<00:03:56.480> some<00:03:56.870> people<00:03:56.900> ask<00:03:57.799> me<00:03:58.040> what<00:03:58.400> is<00:03:58.430> wrong

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
know some people ask me what is wrong

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:00.820 
know some people ask me what is wrong
this<00:03:59.180> bike<00:03:59.390> is<00:03:59.420> so<00:03:59.720> simple<00:03:59.989> it<00:04:00.380> shouldn't<00:04:00.739> be

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
this bike is so simple it shouldn't be

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.250 
this bike is so simple it shouldn't be
that<00:04:00.860> difficult<00:04:01.010> to<00:04:01.489> fix<00:04:01.790> yeah<00:04:02.060> it's<00:04:02.239> true<00:04:02.630> but

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
that difficult to fix yeah it's true but

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.479 
that difficult to fix yeah it's true but
in<00:04:03.620> Bali<00:04:03.890> thinks<00:04:04.820> that<00:04:04.940> would<00:04:05.090> be<00:04:05.239> easy<00:04:05.989> in

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
in Bali thinks that would be easy in

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.640 
in Bali thinks that would be easy in
another<00:04:07.489> world<00:04:07.820> our<00:04:08.380> challenging<00:04:09.380> here

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
another world our challenging here

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.910 
another world our challenging here
because<00:04:10.070> Valley<00:04:10.400> does<00:04:10.790> not<00:04:11.000> have<00:04:11.209> that<00:04:11.360> many

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
because Valley does not have that many

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.860 
because Valley does not have that many
professionals<00:04:12.920> and<00:04:13.280> things<00:04:14.209> just<00:04:14.390> working<00:04:14.810> a

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
professionals and things just working a

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.150 
professionals and things just working a
little<00:04:15.080> different<00:04:15.440> and<00:04:15.560> just<00:04:15.800> to<00:04:15.920> give<00:04:16.070> you

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
little different and just to give you

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.820 
little different and just to give you
one<00:04:16.280> example<00:04:16.310> I<00:04:17.030> had<00:04:17.630> my<00:04:17.660> bike<00:04:17.989> for<00:04:18.349> six<00:04:18.620> days

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
one example I had my bike for six days

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:19.629 
one example I had my bike for six days
at

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
at

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:22.209 
at
under<00:04:19.819> way<00:04:20.539> to<00:04:20.780> be<00:04:20.900> fixed<00:04:21.349> I<00:04:21.560> picked<00:04:22.009> it<00:04:22.129> up

00:04:22.209 --> 00:04:22.219 
under way to be fixed I picked it up

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:24.070 
under way to be fixed I picked it up
after<00:04:22.610> six<00:04:22.819> days<00:04:22.999> or<00:04:23.210> someone<00:04:23.629> picked<00:04:23.870> it<00:04:23.960> up

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
after six days or someone picked it up

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.520 
after six days or someone picked it up
for<00:04:24.349> me<00:04:24.469> in<00:04:24.710> an<00:04:25.249> Asian<00:04:25.520> person<00:04:25.550> that<00:04:26.449> is<00:04:27.229> also

challenge already there and I had

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:37.059 
challenge already there and I had
someone<00:04:34.909> picking<00:04:35.180> the<00:04:35.389> bike<00:04:35.539> up<00:04:35.719> for<00:04:35.990> me<00:04:36.139> he
