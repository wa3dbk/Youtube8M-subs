install on an o2 adapter one of the

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.790 
install on an o2 adapter one of the
issues<00:00:17.580> we<00:00:17.789> face<00:00:17.820> with<00:00:18.359> professional<00:00:19.350> tuning

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
issues we face with professional tuning

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.099 
issues we face with professional tuning
is<00:00:19.980> getting<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.520> clean<00:00:20.820> o2<00:00:21.270> signal<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.840> tune

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
is getting a clean o2 signal to tune

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.189 
is getting a clean o2 signal to tune
from<00:00:22.380> two-speed<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.220> project<00:00:23.789> up<00:00:24.029> we<00:00:24.869> remove

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
from two-speed the project up we remove

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.080 
from two-speed the project up we remove
the<00:00:25.560> heat<00:00:25.769> shields<00:00:26.189> from<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.490> exhaust<00:00:26.789> and

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
the heat shields from the exhaust and

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.150 
the heat shields from the exhaust and
the<00:00:27.150> floorboards<00:00:27.779> for<00:00:27.990> easy<00:00:28.140> access<00:00:28.470> as

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
the floorboards for easy access as

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.669 
the floorboards for easy access as
you're<00:00:29.310> taking<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.849> heat<00:00:30.480> shields<00:00:30.990> off<00:00:31.260> we

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
you're taking the heat shields off we

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.530 
you're taking the heat shields off we
wanted<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.130> make<00:00:32.369> sure<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.759> Mark<00:00:33.000> whether<00:00:33.420> the

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
wanted to make sure and Mark whether the

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.840 
wanted to make sure and Mark whether the
clamps<00:00:34.020> were<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.649> hold<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.010> heat<00:00:35.190> shields<00:00:35.670> on

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
clamps were to hold the heat shields on

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.840 
clamps were to hold the heat shields on
so<00:00:36.239> when<00:00:36.450> we<00:00:36.600> put<00:00:36.840> our<00:00:36.989> limits<00:00:37.680> in<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:38.280> we<00:00:38.670> can

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
so when we put our limits in that we can

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.549 
so when we put our limits in that we can
get<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.090> heat<00:00:39.239> shields<00:00:39.629> back<00:00:39.809> on<00:00:40.050> with<00:00:40.290> no

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
get the heat shields back on with no

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.540 
get the heat shields back on with no

rivet nuts into the pipe the nice thing

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.930 
rivet nuts into the pipe the nice thing
about<00:00:55.320> these<00:00:55.800> are<00:00:56.070> they're<00:00:56.250> not<00:00:56.430> intrusive

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
about these are they're not intrusive

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.430 
about these are they're not intrusive
they<00:00:57.300> don't<00:00:57.510> hang<00:00:57.690> into<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.050> pipe<00:00:58.260> and

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
they don't hang into the pipe and

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.590 
they don't hang into the pipe and
restrict<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.980> exhaust<00:00:59.309> flow<00:00:59.520> then<00:01:00.300> we<00:01:00.420> have

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
restrict the exhaust flow then we have

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.569 
restrict the exhaust flow then we have
adapters<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.440> actually<00:01:01.800> bolt<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.250> pipe

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
adapters that actually bolt to the pipe

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.600 
adapters that actually bolt to the pipe
that<00:01:02.850> our<00:01:02.969> o2<00:01:03.120> sensors<00:01:03.780> screw<00:01:04.769> into<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.460> way

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
that our o2 sensors screw into that way

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.030 
that our o2 sensors screw into that way
we<00:01:05.760> could<00:01:05.880> use<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.210> wideband<00:01:06.450> sensors<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.890> do

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
we could use the wideband sensors to do

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.560 
we could use the wideband sensors to do
a<00:01:08.070> professional<00:01:08.310> tune<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.240> get<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.390> much

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
a professional tune and get a much

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.940 
a professional tune and get a much
better<00:01:09.810> running<00:01:10.140> but<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.590> comes<00:01:10.799> with

automatic Center punch to give us a pipe

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.510 
automatic Center punch to give us a pipe
so<00:01:29.280> we<00:01:29.310> can<00:01:29.430> do<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.790> pilot<00:01:30.390> drill<00:01:31.250> we'll<00:01:32.250> punch

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
so we can do a pilot drill we'll punch

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.800 
so we can do a pilot drill we'll punch
both<00:01:32.790> pipes<00:01:34.310> as<00:01:35.310> such<00:01:35.850> again<00:01:36.270> we<00:01:36.390> mark<00:01:36.600> the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
both pipes as such again we mark the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.719 
both pipes as such again we mark the
front<00:01:37.259> cylinder<00:01:37.560> where<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.979> clamp<00:01:38.250> goes<00:01:38.340> we

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
front cylinder where the clamp goes we

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.370 
front cylinder where the clamp goes we
have<00:01:38.759> plenty<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.240> clearance<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.140> when

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
have plenty of clearance so that when

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.960 
have plenty of clearance so that when
we're<00:01:40.530> done<00:01:40.680> we<00:01:40.920> can<00:01:41.070> put<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.340> rivet<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:41.790> and

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
we're done we can put the rivet in and

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.999 
we're done we can put the rivet in and
everything<00:01:42.329> will<00:01:42.479> be<00:01:42.509> as<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.020> was<00:01:43.320> before<00:01:43.500> we

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
everything will be as it was before we

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.499 
everything will be as it was before we
started<00:01:44.460> we're<00:01:44.820> starting<00:01:45.119> with<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.360> number

comes with a 3/8 drill included that's a
little<00:01:52.229> too<00:01:52.350> big<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.590> start<00:01:52.950> with<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:53.369> we're

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
little too big to start with so we're

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:01.220 
little too big to start with so we're
gonna<00:01:53.549> make<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.790> small<00:01:54.119> hole<00:01:54.329> in<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.540> beginning

there are pilot holes are now finished
we've<00:02:04.080> got<00:02:04.260> the<00:02:04.380> final<00:02:04.800> drill<00:02:05.070> bit<00:02:05.280> in<00:02:05.750> it's

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
we've got the final drill bit in it's

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.450 
we've got the final drill bit in it's
the<00:02:06.870> correct<00:02:07.110> size<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.620> comes<00:02:07.860> with<00:02:08.070> the<00:02:08.220> kit

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
the correct size that comes with the kit

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.880 
the correct size that comes with the kit
that<00:02:08.520> sizes<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.420> hole<00:02:09.600> for<00:02:09.900> the<00:02:09.990> rivet<00:02:10.230> nut<00:02:10.530> to

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
that sizes the hole for the rivet nut to

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.880 
that sizes the hole for the rivet nut to
get<00:02:11.070> the<00:02:11.220> correct<00:02:11.490> crimp<00:02:12.440> we<00:02:13.440> don't<00:02:13.620> want<00:02:13.800> to

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
get the correct crimp we don't want to

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.800 
get the correct crimp we don't want to
elongate<00:02:14.460> the<00:02:14.640> hole<00:02:14.850> in<00:02:15.090> any<00:02:15.240> way<00:02:15.450> or<00:02:15.660> the

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
elongate the hole in any way or the

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.410 
elongate the hole in any way or the
rivet<00:02:16.170> nut<00:02:16.350> will<00:02:16.500> come<00:02:16.710> loose<00:02:17.210> so<00:02:18.210> we're<00:02:18.300> gonna

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
rivet nut will come loose so we're gonna

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.940 
rivet nut will come loose so we're gonna
be<00:02:18.510> real<00:02:18.660> careful<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.200> make<00:02:19.590> this<00:02:19.800> hole

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
be real careful and make this hole

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.980 
be real careful and make this hole
straight<00:02:20.250> as<00:02:20.370> possible

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.030 

next<00:02:26.950> we<00:02:27.100> have<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.400> hydraulic<00:02:27.790> crimping<00:02:28.390> tool

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
next we have the hydraulic crimping tool

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.740 
next we have the hydraulic crimping tool
we<00:02:30.040> have<00:02:30.190> the<00:02:30.400> rivet<00:02:30.730> net<00:02:30.910> itself<00:02:31.300> we're<00:02:31.600> going

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
we have the rivet net itself we're going

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.220 
we have the rivet net itself we're going
to<00:02:31.810> install<00:02:32.170> it<00:02:32.430> on<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.700> tool<00:02:33.940> then<00:02:34.930> it<00:02:35.050> down

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
to install it on the tool then it down

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.500 
to install it on the tool then it down
to<00:02:35.440> the<00:02:35.560> end<00:02:35.710> of<00:02:35.830> the<00:02:35.920> anvil<00:02:36.100> like<00:02:36.520> so<00:02:36.910> now

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
to the end of the anvil like so now

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.090 
to the end of the anvil like so now
we're<00:02:37.660> going<00:02:37.780> to<00:02:37.870> insert<00:02:38.380> the<00:02:38.590> rivet<00:02:38.920> and<00:02:39.010> that

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
we're going to insert the rivet and that

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.830 
we're going to insert the rivet and that
ended<00:02:39.400> a<00:02:39.460> pre-drilled<00:02:40.030> hole<00:02:40.830> such<00:02:41.830> a<00:02:42.840> nice

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
ended a pre-drilled hole such a nice

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.320 
ended a pre-drilled hole such a nice
tight<00:02:44.170> fit

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
tight fit

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.610 
tight fit
we're<00:02:46.330> just<00:02:46.450> pumping<00:02:46.840> it<00:02:46.960> now<00:02:47.080> again<00:02:47.350> it's<00:02:47.500> a

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
we're just pumping it now again it's a

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.440 
we're just pumping it now again it's a
hydraulic<00:02:47.830> crimper<00:02:48.370> instead<00:02:48.910> of<00:02:49.000> a<00:02:49.060> manual

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
hydraulic crimper instead of a manual

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.740 
hydraulic crimper instead of a manual
crimper<00:02:50.520> good<00:02:51.520> and<00:02:51.790> tight<00:02:52.090> we're<00:02:52.570> done

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
crimper good and tight we're done

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.600 
crimper good and tight we're done
krumping<00:02:53.260> then<00:02:53.710> we<00:02:53.800> grab<00:02:54.040> a<00:02:54.070> hold<00:02:54.370> of<00:02:54.520> the

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
krumping then we grab a hold of the

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.780 
krumping then we grab a hold of the
barrel<00:02:55.060> on<00:02:55.210> the<00:02:55.270> end<00:02:55.510> of<00:02:55.600> the<00:02:55.720> tool<00:02:56.550> and<00:02:57.550> it

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
barrel on the end of the tool and it

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.210 
barrel on the end of the tool and it
unscrew<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:58.720> anvil<00:02:59.170> from<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.620> rivet<00:03:00.040> nut

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
unscrew the anvil from the rivet nut

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.840 
unscrew the anvil from the rivet nut
itself

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
itself

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.690 
itself
this<00:03:01.780> takes<00:03:02.050> just<00:03:02.350> a<00:03:02.470> second<00:03:02.980> and<00:03:03.340> when<00:03:03.550> we're

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
this takes just a second and when we're

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.140 
this takes just a second and when we're
all<00:03:03.730> done<00:03:04.030> we'll<00:03:04.240> see<00:03:04.450> that<00:03:04.600> the<00:03:04.750> rivet<00:03:05.080> nut<00:03:05.290> is

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
all done we'll see that the rivet nut is

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.210 
all done we'll see that the rivet nut is
almost<00:03:07.150> flush<00:03:07.540> mount<00:03:07.870> as<00:03:08.110> you<00:03:08.320> know<00:03:08.470> we<00:03:09.010> want

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
almost flush mount as you know we want

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.820 
almost flush mount as you know we want
to<00:03:09.250> do<00:03:09.400> this<00:03:09.550> on<00:03:09.940> cool<00:03:10.240> exhaust<00:03:10.660> pipes<00:03:10.990> the

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
to do this on cool exhaust pipes the

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.130 
to do this on cool exhaust pipes the
rivet<00:03:12.130> nut<00:03:12.280> is<00:03:12.430> crimped<00:03:12.820> in<00:03:12.940> place<00:03:13.300> next<00:03:14.020> we

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
rivet nut is crimped in place next we

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.870 
rivet nut is crimped in place next we
have<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.410> adapter<00:03:14.740> this<00:03:15.250> is<00:03:15.430> what<00:03:15.610> the<00:03:15.730> o2

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
have the adapter this is what the o2

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.620 
have the adapter this is what the o2
sensor<00:03:16.540> screws<00:03:16.870> into<00:03:17.110> we<00:03:18.070> have<00:03:18.280> a<00:03:18.630> special

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
sensor screws into we have a special

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.150 
sensor screws into we have a special
bolt<00:03:19.870> with<00:03:20.080> a<00:03:20.110> hole<00:03:20.410> through<00:03:20.680> the<00:03:20.770> center<00:03:20.980> and

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
bolt with a hole through the center and

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.130

a<00:03:21.400> copper<00:03:21.820> steel<00:03:22.060> washer<00:03:22.390> so<00:03:22.750> we<00:03:22.840> get<00:03:22.990> no

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
a copper steel washer so we get no

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.560 
a copper steel washer so we get no
leakage<00:03:23.620> but<00:03:24.490> if<00:03:24.580> we<00:03:24.700> don't<00:03:24.820> anti-seize<00:03:25.390> the

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
leakage but if we don't anti-seize the

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.150 
leakage but if we don't anti-seize the
bolt<00:03:25.840> it'll<00:03:26.170> never<00:03:26.320> come<00:03:26.590> out<00:03:26.770> when<00:03:27.010> we're

bolt it'll never come out when we're

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.260 
bolt it'll never come out when we're
when<00:03:27.550> it's<00:03:27.700> hot

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
when it's hot

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.620

a<00:03:29.040> little<00:03:30.040> copper<00:03:30.460> anti-seize<00:03:31.060> just<00:03:31.360> to<00:03:31.480> put

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
a little copper anti-seize just to put

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.120 
a little copper anti-seize just to put
on<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:31.870> threads<00:03:32.230> to<00:03:32.440> make<00:03:32.620> sure<00:03:32.800> we<00:03:32.980> can

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
on the threads to make sure we can

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.340 
on the threads to make sure we can
extract<00:03:33.490> the<00:03:33.700> bolt<00:03:33.940> and<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:34.180> process<00:03:34.660> is<00:03:34.840> done

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.229 

right<00:03:38.350> down<00:03:38.680> in<00:03:38.920> there

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.420 

begin<00:03:41.840> it's<00:03:42.019> a<00:03:42.109> hollow<00:03:42.409> bolt<00:03:42.890> so<00:03:43.129> we<00:03:43.250> don't

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
begin it's a hollow bolt so we don't

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.679 
begin it's a hollow bolt so we don't
want<00:03:43.609> to<00:03:43.670> over-tighten<00:03:43.969> it

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:44.689 
want to over-tighten it

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:47.740 
want to over-tighten it
my<00:03:45.109> preference<00:03:45.709> is<00:03:45.859> to<00:03:45.920> put<00:03:46.250> the<00:03:46.459> the<00:03:46.849> bungs<00:03:47.450> on

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
my preference is to put the the bungs on

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.599 
my preference is to put the the bungs on
the<00:03:47.870> outside<00:03:48.439> of<00:03:48.590> the<00:03:48.709> exhaust<00:03:49.099> to<00:03:49.370> try<00:03:49.549> to

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
the outside of the exhaust to try to

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:51.099 
the outside of the exhaust to try to
keep<00:03:49.849> him<00:03:50.000> out<00:03:50.090> of<00:03:50.150> harm's<00:03:50.299> way

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
keep him out of harm's way

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:53.619 
keep him out of harm's way
and<00:03:51.620> we'll<00:03:51.859> demonstrate<00:03:52.150> why<00:03:53.150> in<00:03:53.329> just<00:03:53.450> a

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:53.629 
and we'll demonstrate why in just a

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:57.550 
and we'll demonstrate why in just a
second<00:03:55.629> again<00:03:56.629> we're<00:03:56.870> just<00:03:56.900> doing<00:03:57.140> a<00:03:57.349> light

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
second again we're just doing a light

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.800 
second again we're just doing a light
snug<00:03:57.950> that's<00:03:58.219> a<00:03:58.340> hollow<00:03:58.609> bolt<00:03:59.030> we<00:03:59.329> don't<00:03:59.540> we

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
snug that's a hollow bolt we don't we

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.949 
snug that's a hollow bolt we don't we
don't<00:03:59.989> want<00:04:00.139> a<00:04:00.200> two-piece<00:04:00.680> bolt<00:04:01.540> once<00:04:02.540> this<00:04:02.750> is

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
don't want a two-piece bolt once this is

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.879 
don't want a two-piece bolt once this is
installed<00:04:03.139> and<00:04:03.709> tight<00:04:04.010> we<00:04:04.909> have<00:04:04.939> the<00:04:05.329> tubes

such<00:04:09.319> right<00:04:09.920> now<00:04:10.189> we're<00:04:10.459> just<00:04:10.579> going<00:04:10.760> to<00:04:10.790> loop

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
such right now we're just going to loop

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.729 
such right now we're just going to loop
this<00:04:11.209> around<00:04:11.269> the<00:04:11.719> air<00:04:11.870> cleaner<00:04:12.230> we<00:04:12.439> know<00:04:12.560> the

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
this around the air cleaner we know the

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.800 
this around the air cleaner we know the
bikes<00:04:12.950> cold<00:04:13.400> and<00:04:14.000> it's<00:04:14.209> just<00:04:14.329> gonna<00:04:14.450> keep<00:04:14.659> it

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
bikes cold and it's just gonna keep it

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.150 
bikes cold and it's just gonna keep it
out<00:04:14.900> of<00:04:14.930> harm's<00:04:15.169> way<00:04:15.409> till<00:04:15.709> we<00:04:15.859> can<00:04:15.950> get<00:04:16.039> the

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
out of harm's way till we can get the

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.890 
out of harm's way till we can get the
other<00:04:16.310> side<00:04:16.609> done<00:04:16.669> and<00:04:17.120> move<00:04:17.209> the<00:04:17.359> bike<00:04:17.570> to<00:04:17.780> the

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
other side done and move the bike to the

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.870 
other side done and move the bike to the
dyno

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.810 

final<00:04:24.720> step<00:04:24.930> of<00:04:25.080> our<00:04:25.230> installation<00:04:26.010> we<00:04:26.580> put

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
final step of our installation we put

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.770 
final step of our installation we put
our<00:04:26.970> air<00:04:27.510> tubes<00:04:27.900> on<00:04:28.170> the<00:04:29.090> motor<00:04:30.090> still<00:04:30.450> called

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
our air tubes on the motor still called

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.180 
our air tubes on the motor still called
I<00:04:31.020> just<00:04:31.050> wrapped<00:04:31.470> them<00:04:31.620> around<00:04:31.710> the<00:04:32.070> air

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
I just wrapped them around the air

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.560 
I just wrapped them around the air
cleaner<00:04:32.550> to<00:04:32.760> get<00:04:32.880> them<00:04:33.030> out<00:04:33.150> of<00:04:33.180> the<00:04:33.360> way<00:04:33.510> for

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
cleaner to get them out of the way for

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.700 
cleaner to get them out of the way for
right<00:04:33.960> now<00:04:35.180> we<00:04:36.180> have<00:04:36.360> the<00:04:36.600> the<00:04:36.900> tubes<00:04:37.230> to<00:04:37.500> keep

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
right now we have the the tubes to keep

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.250 
right now we have the the tubes to keep
air<00:04:37.980> from<00:04:38.010> entering<00:04:38.460> back<00:04:39.150> into<00:04:39.510> the<00:04:39.660> the<00:04:39.930> o2

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
air from entering back into the the o2

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.010 
air from entering back into the the o2
sensor<00:04:40.860> chambers<00:04:41.510> that<00:04:42.510> would<00:04:42.660> contaminate

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
sensor chambers that would contaminate

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.920 
sensor chambers that would contaminate
the<00:04:43.470> reading<00:04:43.860> and<00:04:44.040> we<00:04:44.610> don't<00:04:45.120> need<00:04:45.270> that<00:04:45.570> so<00:04:45.840> we

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
the reading and we don't need that so we

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.930
