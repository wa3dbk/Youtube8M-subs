and<00:04:06.940> we<00:04:07.299> might<00:04:07.390> look<00:04:07.600> at<00:04:07.720> that<00:04:07.870> cipriana<00:04:08.470> at

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
and we might look at that cipriana at

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.530 
and we might look at that cipriana at
safety<00:04:09.190> to<00:04:09.370> know<00:04:09.640> we<00:04:09.760> have<00:04:09.790> time<00:04:10.030> on<00:04:10.239> branch

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
safety to know we have time on branch

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:11.610 
safety to know we have time on branch
you<00:04:10.690> know<00:04:10.810> he's<00:04:11.140> got<00:04:11.200> a<00:04:11.320> look<00:04:11.470> at<00:04:11.560> those

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
you know he's got a look at those

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.020 
you know he's got a look at those
football<00:04:11.980> outsider<00:04:12.370> players<00:04:12.700> and<00:04:12.850> see<00:04:12.940> what

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
football outsider players and see what

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.160 
football outsider players and see what
we<00:04:13.090> could<00:04:13.180> do<00:04:13.329> and<00:04:13.510> here<00:04:13.660> my<00:04:13.780> controller

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
we could do and here my controller

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.560 
we could do and here my controller
actually<00:04:14.380> dies<00:04:14.890> so<00:04:15.370> I<00:04:15.579> was<00:04:15.970> nailed<00:04:16.180> to<00:04:16.239> guard<00:04:16.450> I

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
actually dies so I was nailed to guard I

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.090 
actually dies so I was nailed to guard I
would<00:04:16.780> have<00:04:16.900> been<00:04:17.109> there<00:04:17.140> in<00:04:17.530> that<00:04:17.650> area<00:04:17.919> i

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
would have been there in that area i

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.009 
would have been there in that area i
can't<00:04:18.760> say<00:04:18.910> i<00:04:18.940> could<00:04:19.239> made<00:04:19.359> the<00:04:19.479> plan<00:04:19.720> on<00:04:19.840> it

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
can't say i could made the plan on it

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.390 
can't say i could made the plan on it
but<00:04:20.229> i<00:04:20.440> definitely<00:04:20.919> would<00:04:21.190> have<00:04:21.220> been

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
but i definitely would have been

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.370 
but i definitely would have been
watching<00:04:21.820> that<00:04:22.000> like<00:04:22.210> vertical<00:04:22.630> play<00:04:22.810> but

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
watching that like vertical play but

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.140 
watching that like vertical play but
controller<00:04:24.250> dive<00:04:24.580> but

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
controller dive but

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.550 
controller dive but
we<00:04:25.300> were<00:04:25.419> able<00:04:25.479> to<00:04:25.690> get<00:04:25.780> a<00:04:25.840> new<00:04:25.930> controller<00:04:26.320> in

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
we were able to get a new controller in

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.170 
we were able to get a new controller in
time<00:04:26.830> for<00:04:27.009> the<00:04:27.070> next<00:04:27.100> play<00:04:27.520> they've<00:04:27.759> read<00:04:27.970> in<00:04:28.120> a

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
time for the next play they've read in a

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.990 
time for the next play they've read in a

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
time Sherman drops it but it's really

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.770 
time Sherman drops it but it's really

halfway of 100 is 50 you start thinking

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.450 
halfway of 100 is 50 you start thinking
about<00:05:04.750> hey<00:05:05.020> should<00:05:05.380> we<00:05:05.410> go<00:05:05.470> for<00:05:05.710> the<00:05:05.800> 100-point
