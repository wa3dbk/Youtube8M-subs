00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.220
I've been racing here for 18 years, I guess you know,

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.070
it's always been the focus on what's happening next.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.320
But still the 18 years have passed on like this.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:58.160
My name is Alain Boudouin and I am one of the official painters of Le Mans.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.180
Le Mans without the race would be just a big village.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:12.010
It's an engine for Le Mans, something which moves everything forward.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.240
Imagine Audi would have said after the race in 1999:

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.740
"No, we stop the Le Mans program."

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.080
I can't imagine what might have happenend or not happened.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.220
It's exceptional to know we are going to have

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.040
a fantastic race this year 2015

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:49.050
one of the best in all of Le Mans history.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.200
You will not be here as a driver but ...

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.110
... you will be here, which is very important.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.230
I believe it's a great honor for me to be Grand Marshal.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.060
And what I look particularly forward to is leading the field

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.060
into this year's edition of the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.140
The first lap together with the grid.
