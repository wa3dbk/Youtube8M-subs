00:01:07.209 --> 00:01:07.219 
football that much but then but then in

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:09.969 
football that much but then but then in
the<00:01:07.399> 80<00:01:07.850> minute<00:01:08.180> mark<00:01:08.420> from<00:01:09.200> a<00:01:09.290> penalty<00:01:09.740> kick

the 80 minute mark from a penalty kick

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.210 
the 80 minute mark from a penalty kick
oh<00:01:11.080> what's<00:01:12.080> that<00:01:12.140> supposed<00:01:12.560> to<00:01:12.680> be<00:01:12.710> a<00:01:12.799> penalty

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
oh what's that supposed to be a penalty

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.060 
oh what's that supposed to be a penalty
kick<00:01:13.430> because<00:01:14.360> it<00:01:14.960> wasn't<00:01:15.350> going<00:01:15.500> in<00:01:15.740> anyway

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
kick because it wasn't going in anyway

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.219 
kick because it wasn't going in anyway
that's<00:01:16.340> what<00:01:16.490> I<00:01:16.549> saw<00:01:17.150> I<00:01:17.180> thought<00:01:17.900> the<00:01:18.080> game

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
that's what I saw I thought the game

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.850 
that's what I saw I thought the game
that<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:18.770> ball<00:01:18.950> wasn't<00:01:19.159> going<00:01:19.520> in<00:01:19.640> anyway<00:01:19.970> so

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
that the ball wasn't going in anyway so

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.170 
that the ball wasn't going in anyway so
it<00:01:21.860> shouldn't<00:01:22.220> have<00:01:22.310> been<00:01:22.340> a<00:01:22.520> penalty<00:01:22.700> kick

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
it shouldn't have been a penalty kick

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.750 
it shouldn't have been a penalty kick
but<00:01:23.420> it<00:01:23.630> is<00:01:23.750> what<00:01:23.960> it<00:01:23.990> is<00:01:24.080> and<00:01:24.760> Jimenez
