always<00:00:14.190> drop<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.580> legendary<00:00:14.969> item

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
always drop a legendary item

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.480 
always drop a legendary item
it<00:00:16.199> didn't<00:00:16.440> do<00:00:16.500> beforehand<00:00:17.010> which<00:00:17.190> made<00:00:17.369> it

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
it didn't do beforehand which made it

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.769 
it didn't do beforehand which made it
really<00:00:17.760> annoying<00:00:17.970> when<00:00:18.210> you<00:00:18.270> go<00:00:18.449> through<00:00:18.630> the

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
really annoying when you go through the

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.380 
really annoying when you go through the
hassle<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.260> spawning<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.859> killing<00:00:20.390> nothing

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
hassle of spawning and killing nothing

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.179 
hassle of spawning and killing nothing
so<00:00:22.199> I<00:00:22.230> think<00:00:22.320> it<00:00:22.439> was<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.590> pretty<00:00:22.769> good<00:00:22.920> update

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
so I think it was a pretty good update

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.640 
so I think it was a pretty good update
but<00:00:23.430> he's<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.880> only<00:00:23.990> enemy<00:00:24.990> in<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.380> entire

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
but he's the only enemy in the entire

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.990 
but he's the only enemy in the entire
game<00:00:25.859> other<00:00:26.099> than<00:00:26.189> my<00:00:26.400> period<00:00:26.760> who<00:00:26.849> has<00:00:26.970> a
