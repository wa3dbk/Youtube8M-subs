00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
see here at the tech points so where you

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.740 
see here at the tech points so where you
would<00:00:43.680> normally<00:00:43.860> build<00:00:44.280> like<00:00:44.640> your<00:00:45.000> command

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
would normally build like your command

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.170 
would normally build like your command
stations<00:00:46.140> or<00:00:46.320> hives<00:00:46.559> they<00:00:47.190> spawn<00:00:47.550> upgrades

weapons such as that and then what

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.000 
weapons such as that and then what
you'll<00:00:54.180> have<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.360> do<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.809> you'll<00:00:55.110> just<00:00:55.289> have<00:00:55.680> to

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
you'll have to do is you'll just have to

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.520 
you'll have to do is you'll just have to
try<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.940> survive<00:00:59.690> obviously<00:01:00.690> as<00:01:00.960> more<00:01:01.410> and

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
try and survive obviously as more and

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.500 
try and survive obviously as more and
more<00:01:01.590> Marines<00:01:02.039> for<00:01:02.399> there<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:03.059> will<00:01:03.180> become

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
more Marines for there it will become

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.179 
more Marines for there it will become
harder<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.899> survive<00:01:04.379> as<00:01:04.680> more<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.129> more

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
harder to survive as more and more

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.370 
harder to survive as more and more
aliens<00:01:05.790> will<00:01:07.280> arise<00:01:08.280> it's<00:01:08.909> actually<00:01:09.540> really

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
aliens will arise it's actually really

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.340 
aliens will arise it's actually really

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
fun you know I dropped onto a server and

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.859 
fun you know I dropped onto a server and
I<00:01:14.220> was<00:01:14.369> frantically<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.270> know<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.390> trying<00:01:15.750> to

decide whether I wanted to stick around
it's<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.330> tech<00:01:18.630> points<00:01:19.080> or<00:01:19.439> if<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:19.920> wanted<00:01:20.220> to

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
it's the tech points or if I wanted to

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.490 
it's the tech points or if I wanted to
you<00:01:21.150> know<00:01:21.210> try<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.570> find<00:01:21.780> like<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.049> good<00:01:22.320> hiding

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
you know try and find like a good hiding

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.990 
you know try and find like a good hiding
spot<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:24.150> anyway<00:01:24.680> your<00:01:25.680> fight<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.310> the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
spot and so anyway your fight and the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.940 
spot and so anyway your fight and the
Marines<00:01:27.270> will<00:01:27.479> slowly<00:01:28.020> get<00:01:28.229> overwhelmed<00:01:28.860> by

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
Marines will slowly get overwhelmed by

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.080 
Marines will slowly get overwhelmed by
the<00:01:29.130> aliens<00:01:29.720> as<00:01:30.720> soon<00:01:30.930> as<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.470> die<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:32.430> mutate

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
the aliens as soon as you die you mutate

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.260 
the aliens as soon as you die you mutate
into<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.509> Elian<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.619> then<00:01:35.490> you'll<00:01:35.850> have<00:01:36.060> to

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
into a Elian and then you'll have to

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.810 
into a Elian and then you'll have to
help<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.720> alien<00:01:36.990> site<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.500> try<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.430> beat<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
help the alien site and try and beat the

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.580 
help the alien site and try and beat the
Marine<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.329> Marines<00:01:39.570> have<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.780> time<00:01:40.290> limit

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
Marine so the Marines have a time limit

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.380 
Marine so the Marines have a time limit
so<00:01:41.100> if<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.340> Marines<00:01:41.579> can<00:01:41.820> survive<00:01:42.119> throughout

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
so if the Marines can survive throughout

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.120 
so if the Marines can survive throughout
the<00:01:42.630> time<00:01:42.840> war<00:01:43.020> they<00:01:43.200> win<00:01:43.439> if<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.770> aliens

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
the time war they win if the aliens

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.249 
the time war they win if the aliens
managed<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.520> kill<00:01:44.700> all<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.060> Marines<00:01:45.360> then<00:01:45.689> the

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
managed to kill all the Marines then the

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.910 
managed to kill all the Marines then the
aliens<00:01:46.619> will<00:01:46.799> win<00:01:47.030> while<00:01:48.030> you're<00:01:48.240> an<00:01:48.329> alien

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
aliens will win while you're an alien

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.190 
aliens will win while you're an alien
you<00:01:49.920> have<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.520> little<00:01:50.729> detection<00:01:51.509> thing<00:01:51.750> up<00:01:51.990> in

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
you have a little detection thing up in

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.230 
you have a little detection thing up in
the<00:01:52.350> top<00:01:52.530> right<00:01:52.740> corner<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.610> tells<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:54.000> when

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
the top right corner it tells you when

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.719 
the top right corner it tells you when
humans<00:01:55.049> are<00:01:55.200> nearby<00:01:55.380> humans<00:01:56.100> are<00:01:56.219> detected

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
humans are nearby humans are detected

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.840 
humans are nearby humans are detected
and<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.390> goes<00:01:57.540> from<00:01:57.780> green<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.649> yellow<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.579> red

and it goes from green to yellow to red

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.580 
and it goes from green to yellow to red
depending<00:02:00.270> on<00:02:00.600> how<00:02:00.780> close<00:02:01.049> they<00:02:01.229> are<00:02:01.259> you

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
depending on how close they are you

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.530 
depending on how close they are you
