position number 2 you then get a

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.750 
position number 2 you then get a
floodlight<00:02:22.050> so<00:02:22.410> you<00:02:22.500> get<00:02:22.590> a<00:02:22.620> spot<00:02:23.100> which<00:02:23.730> is

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
floodlight so you get a spot which is

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.450 
floodlight so you get a spot which is
what<00:02:24.060> this<00:02:24.270> is<00:02:24.480> and<00:02:24.800> then<00:02:25.800> you<00:02:25.980> get<00:02:26.190> a

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
what this is and then you get a

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.970 
what this is and then you get a
floodlight<00:02:26.910> which<00:02:27.570> is<00:02:27.720> what<00:02:27.900> this<00:02:28.080> is<00:02:28.350> as<00:02:28.560> well

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
floodlight which is what this is as well

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.390 
floodlight which is what this is as well
you're<00:02:29.790> roughly<00:02:30.150> looking<00:02:30.510> at<00:02:30.660> about<00:02:31.400> it

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
you're roughly looking at about it

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.730 
you're roughly looking at about it
varies<00:02:32.820> timeline-wise<00:02:33.360> but<00:02:33.870> from<00:02:34.350> it<00:02:34.470> from<00:02:34.650> an

thing about LED don't have to worry
about<00:02:54.630> it<00:02:54.870> can<00:02:55.020> bang<00:02:55.230> it<00:02:55.350> around<00:02:55.440> looking<00:02:56.250> at<00:02:56.340> a

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
about it can bang it around looking at a

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.520 
about it can bang it around looking at a
hundred<00:02:56.640> thousand<00:02:57.210> hour<00:02:57.360> bulb<00:02:58.020> light<00:02:58.290> which
