00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579 
how bone of skin is you might want to

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:04.920 
how bone of skin is you might want to
see<00:02:03.729> what<00:02:03.759> is<00:02:03.969> off-spinner<00:02:04.299> like<00:02:04.509> in<00:02:04.719> full

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
see what is off-spinner like in full

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.350 
see what is off-spinner like in full
motion<00:02:05.110> well<00:02:05.829> I'll<00:02:06.189> show<00:02:06.520> you<00:02:06.579> now<00:02:06.850> what<00:02:07.119> I<00:02:07.179> was

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
motion well I'll show you now what I was

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:19.910 
motion well I'll show you now what I was
going<00:02:07.509> to<00:02:07.539> look<00:02:07.810> like<00:02:07.869> control<00:02:08.410> motion

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:31.140 

two<00:02:20.920> kilometer

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.970 

so<00:02:32.150> recapping<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:33.019> obstacle<00:02:33.440> is<00:02:33.560> a<00:02:33.590> doorway

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
so recapping the obstacle is a doorway

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.589 
so recapping the obstacle is a doorway
that<00:02:34.129> pitch<00:02:34.400> is<00:02:34.549> outside<00:02:34.790> of<00:02:35.090> our<00:02:35.269> system

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
that pitch is outside of our system

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.479 
that pitch is outside of our system

enliven off stump and we're going to hit

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.130 
enliven off stump and we're going to hit
middle<00:02:37.760> stump<00:02:37.970> leg<00:02:38.180> stump<00:02:38.390> or<00:02:38.540> further<00:02:38.840> on<00:02:38.989> and
