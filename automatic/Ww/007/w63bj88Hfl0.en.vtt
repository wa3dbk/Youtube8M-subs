lied on some chances but most

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.660 
lied on some chances but most

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
importantly when we've been in

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.460 
importantly when we've been in
possession<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.150> ball<00:01:42.329> I've<00:01:42.509> seen<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.750> real

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470

attitude<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:44.070> positively<00:01:44.520> from<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.880> players

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
attitude and positively from the players

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.960

to<00:01:45.450> get<00:01:46.170> themselves<00:01:46.350> on<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.680> football<00:01:46.970> create

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
to get themselves on a football create

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.340 
to get themselves on a football create
opportunities<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.659> plan<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:48.990> front<00:01:49.200> foot

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
opportunities and plan the front foot

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.389 
opportunities and plan the front foot
and<00:01:50.899> if<00:01:51.899> that<00:01:52.110> mentality<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.680> already<00:01:52.979> there<00:01:53.159> I

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
and if that mentality is already there I

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.850 
and if that mentality is already there I
think<00:01:53.820> we<00:01:53.880> can<00:01:53.970> only<00:01:54.119> build<00:01:55.110> on<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.380> now<00:01:55.680> and

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
think we can only build on that now and

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.410 
think we can only build on that now and
hopefully<00:01:55.979> take<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.579> even<00:01:56.880> more<00:01:57.149> in<00:01:57.329> the

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
hopefully take it even more in the

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.539 
hopefully take it even more in the
