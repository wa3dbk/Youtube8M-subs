00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
that's right it took a really really

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.580 
that's right it took a really really
long<00:00:42.059> time<00:00:42.390> before<00:00:42.600> they<00:00:42.809> actually<00:00:43.230> started

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
long time before they actually started

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
talents so that they could actually tank

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.840 
talents so that they could actually tank
and<00:00:48.059> even<00:00:48.510> do<00:00:48.719> some<00:00:48.930> decent<00:00:49.140> damage<00:00:49.610> so<00:00:50.610> for

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
and even do some decent damage so for

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.150 
and even do some decent damage so for
those<00:00:50.969> years<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.600> really<00:00:52.140> wasn't<00:00:52.410> much<00:00:52.710> fun<00:00:52.980> to

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
those years it really wasn't much fun to

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.400 
those years it really wasn't much fun to
play<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.370> paladin<00:00:53.879> at<00:00:54.030> all<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:55.199> quick

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
play a paladin at all and the quick

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.900 
play a paladin at all and the quick
fixes<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:56.010> they<00:00:56.160> could<00:00:56.399> have<00:00:56.520> done<00:00:56.730> if

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
fixes that they could have done if

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.450 
fixes that they could have done if
they'd<00:00:57.120> really<00:00:57.390> wanted<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:58.020> never<00:00:58.770> happened

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
they'd really wanted to never happened

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.340 
they'd really wanted to never happened
not<00:00:59.910> until<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.300> Burning<00:01:00.539> Crusade<00:01:00.570> came<00:01:01.199> out

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
not until the Burning Crusade came out

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.290 
not until the Burning Crusade came out
and<00:01:01.680> if<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.460> think<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.879> it's<00:01:03.000> because<00:01:03.270> of

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
and if you think that it's because of

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.509 
and if you think that it's because of
bureaucracy<00:01:03.750> or<00:01:04.409> balance<00:01:04.860> issues<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.430> they

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
bureaucracy or balance issues that they

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.030 
bureaucracy or balance issues that they
didn't<00:01:05.850> do<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.810> really<00:01:07.439> can't<00:01:07.680> be<00:01:07.860> the

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
didn't do this that really can't be the

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.550 
didn't do this that really can't be the
case<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.580> can<00:01:09.330> name<00:01:09.540> one<00:01:09.570> time<00:01:09.900> when<00:01:10.350> Blizzard

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
case I can name one time when Blizzard

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.710 
case I can name one time when Blizzard
proved<00:01:11.130> they<00:01:11.430> can<00:01:11.610> act<00:01:11.909> with<00:01:12.210> speed<00:01:12.570> and

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
proved they can act with speed and

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.350 
proved they can act with speed and
efficiency<00:01:12.840> when<00:01:13.530> they<00:01:13.680> have<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:14.150> back<00:01:15.150> before

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
efficiency when they have to back before

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.359 
efficiency when they have to back before
the<00:01:15.600> Burning<00:01:15.869> Crusade<00:01:15.900> came<00:01:16.530> out<00:01:16.710> one<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.220> our

tanking talents called reckoning was

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.820 
tanking talents called reckoning was
changed<00:01:20.070> dramatically<00:01:20.700> at<00:01:21.200> first<00:01:22.200> here's

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
changed dramatically at first here's

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.370 
changed dramatically at first here's
what<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.130> did<00:01:23.369> every<00:01:24.299> time<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.659> got<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.869> crit<00:01:25.229> on

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
what it did every time you got a crit on

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.249 
what it did every time you got a crit on
you<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:26.100> got<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.310> stackable<00:01:26.880> buff<00:01:27.299> on<00:01:27.540> yourself

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.319 
you you got a stackable buff on yourself
which<00:01:28.560> essentially<00:01:29.070> increased<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.000> number

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
which essentially increased the number

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.929 
which essentially increased the number
of<00:01:30.479> hits<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:31.200> get<00:01:31.439> per<00:01:31.920> melee<00:01:32.310> hit<00:01:32.520> that's

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
of hits you get per melee hit that's

of hits you get per melee hit that's
right<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.990> when<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.259> hit<00:01:34.439> an<00:01:34.530> opponent<00:01:34.799> with

right and when you hit an opponent with

right and when you hit an opponent with
your<00:01:35.310> melee<00:01:35.729> weapon<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.450> counts<00:01:36.900> as<00:01:37.020> two<00:01:37.350> hits

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
your melee weapon it counts as two hits

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.060 
your melee weapon it counts as two hits
instead<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.159> just<00:01:38.369> one<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.909> this<00:01:39.600> stacked

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
before the sky was the limit so someone

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.929 
before the sky was the limit so someone
thought<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.009> would<00:01:44.100> be<00:01:44.220> fun<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.579> get<00:01:44.700> over

nerf it down so that you could only

the sky's the limit number that we had

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.460 
the sky's the limit number that we had
before<00:02:44.730> meant<00:02:45.600> that<00:02:45.750> there<00:02:45.900> was<00:02:46.140> some

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
before meant that there was some

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.360 
before meant that there was some
significant<00:02:47.130> player<00:02:47.340> versus<00:02:47.760> player<00:02:47.790> impact

significant player versus player impact

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.520 
significant player versus player impact
as<00:02:50.370> problematic<00:02:51.000> as<00:02:51.240> that<00:02:51.480> was<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:52.350> real

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
as problematic as that was the real

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.470 
as problematic as that was the real
reason<00:02:52.890> I<00:02:52.980> even<00:02:53.010> brought<00:02:53.520> this<00:02:53.730> up<00:02:53.970> was

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
reason I even brought this up was

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.330 
reason I even brought this up was
because<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.110> fact<00:02:55.350> that<00:02:55.470> Blizzard<00:02:55.950> changed

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
because the fact that Blizzard changed

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.920 
because the fact that Blizzard changed
it<00:02:56.520> in<00:02:56.640> 24<00:02:57.300> hours

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
it in 24 hours

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.050 
it in 24 hours
proves<00:02:58.350> that<00:02:58.560> they<00:02:58.709> are<00:02:58.830> capable<00:02:59.100> of<00:02:59.550> acting

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
proves that they are capable of acting

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.790 
proves that they are capable of acting
with<00:03:00.209> speed<00:03:00.480> and<00:03:00.600> efficiency<00:03:00.720> when<00:03:01.680> the

with speed and efficiency when the

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.490 
with speed and efficiency when the
situation<00:03:02.400> calls<00:03:02.670> for<00:03:02.790> it<00:03:03.090> so<00:03:04.020> why<00:03:04.230> did<00:03:04.380> they

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
situation calls for it so why did they

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.530 
situation calls for it so why did they
leave<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:04.830> Paladin<00:03:05.280> class<00:03:05.520> broken<00:03:06.090> for<00:03:06.300> so

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
leave the Paladin class broken for so

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.020 
leave the Paladin class broken for so
long<00:03:07.340> I<00:03:08.340> have<00:03:09.120> now<00:03:09.300> preponed<00:03:09.780> my<00:03:10.410> guess<00:03:10.740> I<00:03:11.070> mean

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
long I have now preponed my guess I mean

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.030 
long I have now preponed my guess I mean
it's<00:03:12.390> not<00:03:12.600> as<00:03:12.810> if<00:03:12.930> Blizzard<00:03:13.290> didn't<00:03:13.590> know<00:03:13.830> that

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040
