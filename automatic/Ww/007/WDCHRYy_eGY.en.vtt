I<00:05:49.610> do<00:05:50.180> have<00:05:50.420> to<00:05:50.540> see<00:05:50.720> unfortunately<00:05:51.350> that<00:05:51.620> some

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
I do have to see unfortunately that some

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.370 
I do have to see unfortunately that some
of<00:05:51.950> the<00:05:52.040> shadows<00:05:52.490> aren't<00:05:52.970> as<00:05:53.450> pigmented<00:05:54.140> I

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.380 
of the shadows aren't as pigmented I

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:55.810 
of the shadows aren't as pigmented I
guess<00:05:54.680> it's<00:05:54.860> because<00:05:54.980> it's<00:05:55.340> the<00:05:55.430> same<00:05:55.610> color

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:55.820 
guess it's because it's the same color

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.940 
guess it's because it's the same color
as<00:05:55.940> my<00:05:56.000> skin<00:05:56.390> tone<00:05:56.660> so<00:05:56.930> it<00:05:57.080> really<00:05:57.320> does<00:05:57.650> depend

as my skin tone so it really does depend

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.490 
as my skin tone so it really does depend
