00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.809
 milk is a food 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.120
 essential is an essential element for 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:18.880
 growth provides gr 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:22.210
 port of football is very important 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:26.440
 But it certainly has from its also a 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.940
 increased condition of intolerance 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.890
 more and more people are feeding 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.550
 who suffer inter anzhi food a 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:36.910
 cause of an enzyme deficiency of the 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.940
 lactase especially with growth is 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:43.450
 good to know that not everyone can drink 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.730
 milk and that milk is not always good 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.269
 many people and especially people 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.830
 elderly who suffer from osteoporosis 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:52.839
 they tell me they want to drink milk for 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.839
 determine an increase in calcium in the 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:58.690
 bones milk soccer goal, but if you do not 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:01.360
 we have what sets football becomes 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.150
 of the ethereal for which it is a food that 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.830
 then a means that the body has the 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.230
 intolerances and determines 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.810
 basically a lowering of the ph 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:15.340
 I think of acidity as a conductor 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:17.650
 so where 20 is 25 percent 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.360
 of the population that can have milk on 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.670
 milk is an essential food because 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.520
 still have the ability in itself matic 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.460
 in 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.609
 metabolism but there is a big one 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.890
 amount of people 70 75 percent to 

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:33.740
 population that has an enzyme deficiency 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.039
 for which milk is difficult to 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.750
 you can't metabolize 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:41.119
 learn all the nutrients 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.329
 of which I hold it at that point 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:47.390
 the food becomes an element 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:49.369
 absolutely to be avoided because it reduces 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.560
 our ability to metabolize 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.969
 not only of the food in question 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.239
 milk but also of foods that 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:59.780
 we eat together with milk that's why 

00:01:56.239 --> 00:02:02.979
 that we must know our body 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:07.209
 to be able to approach a food 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.209
 important as dairy products
