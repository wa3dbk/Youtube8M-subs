00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
off the difference between mah loader

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.640 
off the difference between mah loader
and<00:00:26.640> minecraft<00:00:27.000> forge<00:00:27.630> installation<00:00:28.470> is

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
and minecraft forge installation is

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.580 
and minecraft forge installation is
really<00:00:29.279> huge<00:00:29.609> like<00:00:29.840> mah<00:00:30.840> loader<00:00:31.080> is<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.260> lot

really huge like mah loader is a lot

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.810 
really huge like mah loader is a lot
more<00:00:31.740> complicated<00:00:32.130> because<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:32.579> have<00:00:32.640> to

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
more complicated because you have to

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.430 
more complicated because you have to
copy<00:00:33.030> some<00:00:33.300> files<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.690> have<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.840> rename<00:00:34.260> the

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
copy some files you have to rename the

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.200 
copy some files you have to rename the
files<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.010> gets<00:00:35.160> really<00:00:35.370> complicated<00:00:35.850> and

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
files and it gets really complicated and

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.240 
files and it gets really complicated and
tricky<00:00:36.360> but<00:00:37.079> for<00:00:37.290> minecraft<00:00:37.649> forge<00:00:37.920> it's

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
tricky but for minecraft forge it's

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.619 
tricky but for minecraft forge it's
super<00:00:38.790> super<00:00:39.000> simple

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629
