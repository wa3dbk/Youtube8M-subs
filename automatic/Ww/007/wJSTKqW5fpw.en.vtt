a lot of times it's not half bad to get
a<00:00:47.430> camcorder<00:00:48.180> or<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.510> may<00:00:48.629> already<00:00:48.809> have<00:00:49.079> a

going to want to look for something with
720p<00:01:18.920> really<00:01:19.920> right<00:01:20.250> now<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.430> mean<00:01:20.759> for<00:01:21.000> video

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
720p really right now I mean for video

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.330 
720p really right now I mean for video
quality<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.990> not<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.380> most<00:01:22.680> important<00:01:23.159> thing

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
quality is not the most important thing

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.100 
quality is not the most important thing
but<00:01:24.119> if<00:01:24.330> you're<00:01:24.600> going<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.780> get<00:01:24.900> something

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
but if you're going to get something

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.590 
but if you're going to get something
with<00:01:25.320> less<00:01:25.470> than<00:01:25.590> 720p<00:01:26.159> video<00:01:26.479> generally<00:01:27.479> it's

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
with less than 720p video generally it's

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.940 
with less than 720p video generally it's
not<00:01:27.750> going<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:27.960> be<00:01:28.020> very<00:01:28.170> good<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.710> you'd<00:01:28.829> be

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
not going to be very good and you'd be

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.260 
not going to be very good and you'd be
better<00:01:29.100> off<00:01:29.220> just<00:01:29.490> not<00:01:29.610> wasting<00:01:30.060> your<00:01:30.210> money

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
better off just not wasting your money

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.690 
better off just not wasting your money
on<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.020> know<00:01:31.259> some<00:01:31.890> smartphones<00:01:32.579> are

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
on that so you know some smartphones are

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.460 
on that so you know some smartphones are
pretty<00:01:32.850> decent<00:01:33.270> like<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:33.869> said<00:01:34.110> there's<00:01:34.259> some

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
pretty decent like I said there's some

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.160 
pretty decent like I said there's some
putt<00:01:34.650> cameras<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.970> there<00:01:36.150> are<00:01:36.240> some<00:01:36.420> smaller

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
putt cameras you there are some smaller

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.580 
putt cameras you there are some smaller
cheaper<00:01:38.570> camcorders<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.600> then<00:01:39.900> up<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.500> up

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
cheaper camcorders and then up and up

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
cheaper camcorders and then up and up
and<00:01:40.710> up<00:01:40.770> all<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.040> wait<00:01:41.189> till<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.460> get<00:01:41.549> to

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
and up all you wait till you get to

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.940 
and up all you wait till you get to
DSLRs<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.450> professional<00:01:42.899> camcorders<00:01:43.470> so

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
DSLRs and professional camcorders so

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.170 
DSLRs and professional camcorders so
that's<00:01:44.100> number<00:01:44.280> one<00:01:44.520> thing<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:44.909> should<00:01:45.060> look

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
that's number one thing you should look

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.319 
that's number one thing you should look
for<00:01:45.450> now<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.560> course<00:01:46.979> video<00:01:47.340> quality<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:47.939> not

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
for now of course video quality is not

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.819 
for now of course video quality is not
everything<00:01:48.630> with<00:01:48.899> just<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.200> camera<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.710> know

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
everything with just the camera you know

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.440 
everything with just the camera you know
I<00:01:49.860> mean<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.310> might<00:01:50.490> buy<00:01:50.729> one<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.970> these<00:01:51.149> and

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
I mean you might buy one of these and

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.179 
I mean you might buy one of these and
think<00:01:52.290> oh<00:01:52.409> that's<00:01:52.530> going<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.770> be<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.950> best

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
think oh that's going to be the best

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.679 
think oh that's going to be the best
video<00:01:53.340> quality<00:01:53.610> no<00:01:54.030> matter<00:01:54.210> what<00:01:54.509> that's

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
video quality no matter what that's

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.090 
video quality no matter what that's
certainly<00:01:55.020> not<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.229> case<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.799> need<00:01:55.950> other

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
certainly not the case is you need other

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.709 
certainly not the case is you need other
things<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.490> back<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.790> up<00:01:56.939> take<00:01:57.540> for<00:01:57.659> example

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
things to back it up take for example

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.149 
things to back it up take for example
what<00:01:58.079> I'm<00:01:58.170> doing<00:01:58.409> right<00:01:58.560> now<00:01:58.619> while<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.100> course

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
what I'm doing right now while of course

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.499 
what I'm doing right now while of course
I've<00:01:59.430> got<00:01:59.610> this<00:01:59.759> here<00:01:59.969> I'm<00:02:00.090> obviously<00:02:00.240> I

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
I've got this here I'm obviously I

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.270 
I've got this here I'm obviously I
felling<00:02:00.810> I'm<00:02:01.020> filming<00:02:01.500> with<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.649> instead<00:02:02.130> a

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
felling I'm filming with the instead a

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.310 
felling I'm filming with the instead a
sends<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:03.060> cue<00:02:03.240> camcorder<00:02:03.840> this<00:02:04.079> thing<00:02:04.229> is

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
sends a cue camcorder this thing is

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.170 
sends a cue camcorder this thing is
about<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.530> hundred<00:02:04.710> bucks<00:02:04.979> right<00:02:05.100> now<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:05.700> with

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
about a hundred bucks right now so with

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.760 
about a hundred bucks right now so with
good<00:02:06.360> lighting<00:02:06.600> with<00:02:06.899> good<00:02:07.079> audio<00:02:07.259> with<00:02:07.560> this

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
good lighting with good audio with this

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.100 
good lighting with good audio with this
quality<00:02:08.280> is<00:02:08.459> certainly<00:02:08.700> not<00:02:08.849> half<00:02:09.060> bad<00:02:09.360> so

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
quality is certainly not half bad so

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.690 
quality is certainly not half bad so
getting<00:02:10.379> away<00:02:10.530> from<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.800> cameras<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.430> want<00:02:11.640> to

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
getting away from the cameras I want to

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.440 
getting away from the cameras I want to
go<00:02:11.760> ahead<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:11.940> talk<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.150> little<00:02:12.300> bit<00:02:12.420> about

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
go ahead and talk a little bit about

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.180 
go ahead and talk a little bit about
your<00:02:12.810> audio<00:02:13.650> as<00:02:13.920> well

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
your audio as well

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.490 
your audio as well
you're<00:02:14.340> lighting<00:02:14.730> so<00:02:15.210> audio<00:02:15.690> can<00:02:16.080> be<00:02:16.170> handled

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
you're lighting so audio can be handled

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.600 
you're lighting so audio can be handled
in<00:02:16.560> a<00:02:16.590> couple<00:02:16.800> different<00:02:16.860> ways<00:02:17.160> when<00:02:17.520> you're

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
in a couple different ways when you're

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.100 
in a couple different ways when you're
first<00:02:17.760> starting<00:02:17.880> out<00:02:18.180> it's<00:02:18.420> best<00:02:18.660> to<00:02:18.720> just<00:02:18.840> use

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
first starting out it's best to just use

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.110 
first starting out it's best to just use
the<00:02:19.290> inboard<00:02:19.740> microphones<00:02:20.310> on<00:02:20.550> your<00:02:20.730> camera

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
the inboard microphones on your camera

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.760 
the inboard microphones on your camera
typically<00:02:22.050> that's<00:02:22.170> going<00:02:22.350> to<00:02:22.410> be<00:02:22.500> really

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
typically that's going to be really

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.100 
typically that's going to be really
simple<00:02:23.010> it<00:02:23.310> helps<00:02:23.640> on<00:02:23.820> video<00:02:24.120> editing<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:24.720> it

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
simple it helps on video editing and it

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.330 
simple it helps on video editing and it
helps<00:02:25.380> you<00:02:25.500> with<00:02:25.680> not<00:02:25.830> having<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:26.190> get

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
helps you with not having to get

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.950 
helps you with not having to get
external<00:02:26.910> microphones<00:02:27.300> and<00:02:27.570> sync<00:02:27.750> it<00:02:27.810> with

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
external microphones and sync it with

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.720 
external microphones and sync it with
video<00:02:28.230> editing<00:02:28.410> on<00:02:28.710> kind<00:02:29.040> stuff<00:02:29.220> so<00:02:29.370> it<00:02:29.490> really

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
video editing on kind stuff so it really

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.360 
video editing on kind stuff so it really
simplifies<00:02:30.240> it<00:02:30.450> so<00:02:31.290> like<00:02:31.620> that<00:02:31.800> it's<00:02:32.130> really

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
simplifies it so like that it's really

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.650 
simplifies it so like that it's really
cheap<00:02:32.520> obviously<00:02:33.000> it's<00:02:33.210> going<00:02:33.300> to<00:02:33.360> be<00:02:33.450> built

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
cheap obviously it's going to be built

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.210 
cheap obviously it's going to be built
into<00:02:33.870> your<00:02:33.960> camera<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.470> it's<00:02:34.710> just<00:02:34.860> going<00:02:35.040> to

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
into your camera and it's just going to

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.130 
into your camera and it's just going to
work<00:02:35.460> however<00:02:35.970> if<00:02:36.210> you<00:02:36.300> want<00:02:36.540> to<00:02:36.570> improve<00:02:36.960> your

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
work however if you want to improve your

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.870 
work however if you want to improve your
video<00:02:37.380> quality<00:02:37.560> you<00:02:37.740> want<00:02:37.950> it<00:02:38.190> to<00:02:38.490> sound

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
video quality you want it to sound

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.430 
video quality you want it to sound
better<00:02:39.210> and<00:02:39.360> all<00:02:39.930> that<00:02:40.080> kind<00:02:40.230> of<00:02:40.260> good<00:02:40.350> stuff

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
better and all that kind of good stuff

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.990

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
audio but of course like I said if

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
just using the standard microphone that

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.070 
just using the standard microphone that
comes<00:03:29.340> with<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:29.550> camera<00:03:29.730> not<00:03:30.360> worry<00:03:30.540> I<00:03:30.780> will

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
comes with the camera not worry I will

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
kind of an interesting thing because it

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.390 
kind of an interesting thing because it

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
see the video quality got much worse if

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.220 
see the video quality got much worse if
I<00:04:34.470> start<00:04:34.830> opening<00:04:35.310> everything<00:04:35.850> back<00:04:36.030> up

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
because I see that the video quality

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.230 
because I see that the video quality
improved<00:04:40.350> quite<00:04:40.620> a<00:04:40.680> bit<00:04:40.950> so<00:04:41.400> that's<00:04:41.850> just<00:04:42.000> kind

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
improved quite a bit so that's just kind

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.240 
improved quite a bit so that's just kind
of<00:04:42.300> a<00:04:42.420> general<00:04:42.630> way<00:04:42.960> to<00:04:43.020> do<00:04:43.260> it<00:04:43.440> if<00:04:43.560> you<00:04:43.950> can<00:04:44.100> get

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
of a general way to do it if you can get

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.740 
of a general way to do it if you can get
more<00:04:44.370> lights<00:04:44.610> I<00:04:44.940> mean<00:04:45.090> and<00:04:45.270> it<00:04:45.330> doesn't<00:04:45.600> happen

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
it's not like you have to go spend a ton

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.920 
it's not like you have to go spend a ton
of<00:04:47.220> money<00:04:47.340> on<00:04:47.430> light<00:04:47.760> boxes<00:04:48.240> I<00:04:48.450> mean<00:04:48.780> if<00:04:48.840> you

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
going to be great just be sure to do it

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.330 
going to be great just be sure to do it
where<00:04:52.620> there's<00:04:52.830> not<00:04:52.890> going<00:04:53.010> to<00:04:53.070> be<00:04:53.130> a<00:04:53.190> lot<00:04:53.310> of

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
where there's not going to be a lot of

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.370 
where there's not going to be a lot of
glare<00:04:53.670> and<00:04:54.120> also<00:04:54.390> you<00:04:54.450> typically<00:04:55.050> were<00:04:55.230> going

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
glare and also you typically were going

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.930 
glare and also you typically were going
to<00:04:55.440> want<00:04:55.620> to<00:04:55.650> have<00:04:55.860> more<00:04:56.130> than<00:04:56.280> one<00:04:56.460> light<00:04:56.700> so

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
to want to have more than one light so

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.610 
to want to have more than one light so
instead<00:04:57.150> of<00:04:57.210> having<00:04:57.390> one<00:04:57.660> overhead<00:04:57.990> light<00:04:58.380> I

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
instead of having one overhead light I

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.170 
instead of having one overhead light I
might<00:04:59.130> have<00:04:59.250> a<00:04:59.280> couple<00:04:59.490> lights<00:04:59.730> from<00:04:59.880> the<00:04:59.910> side

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
might have a couple lights from the side

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.240 
might have a couple lights from the side
as<00:05:00.390> well<00:05:00.570> as<00:05:00.660> from<00:05:00.720> behind<00:05:01.290> me<00:05:01.470> so<00:05:01.740> you<00:05:02.160> know

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
as well as from behind me so you know

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.130 
as well as from behind me so you know
it's<00:05:02.430> good<00:05:02.670> to<00:05:02.700> have<00:05:02.880> lighting<00:05:03.600> from<00:05:03.720> multiple

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
it's good to have lighting from multiple

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.330 
it's good to have lighting from multiple
angles<00:05:04.500> I'm<00:05:04.650> not<00:05:04.740> going<00:05:04.860> to<00:05:04.920> get<00:05:05.010> super

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
angles I'm not going to get super

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.610 
angles I'm not going to get super
in-depth<00:05:05.880> into<00:05:06.120> that<00:05:06.300> but<00:05:06.600> that's<00:05:07.260> definitely

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
in-depth into that but that's definitely

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.230 
in-depth into that but that's definitely
what<00:05:07.710> great<00:05:07.920> way<00:05:08.040> to<00:05:08.100> go<00:05:08.310> and<00:05:08.580> as<00:05:08.670> you<00:05:08.700> improve

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
what great way to go and as you improve

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.120 
what great way to go and as you improve
and<00:05:09.480> as<00:05:09.600> you<00:05:09.780> decide<00:05:10.380> you<00:05:10.590> need<00:05:10.740> to<00:05:10.860> upgrade

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
and as you decide you need to upgrade

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.010 
and as you decide you need to upgrade
then<00:05:11.580> you<00:05:11.640> can<00:05:11.760> certainly<00:05:11.910> go<00:05:12.300> and<00:05:12.630> you<00:05:12.960> know

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
then you can certainly go and you know

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.000 
then you can certainly go and you know
get<00:05:13.140> into<00:05:13.380> that<00:05:13.500> some<00:05:13.620> of<00:05:13.680> those<00:05:13.740> lighting

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
get into that some of those lighting

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.520 
get into that some of those lighting

I'm<00:05:20.760> actually<00:05:20.850> going<00:05:21.060> to<00:05:21.150> cover<00:05:21.300> that<00:05:21.480> a

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
I'm actually going to cover that a

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.720 
I'm actually going to cover that a
little<00:05:21.780> bit<00:05:21.870> and<00:05:22.020> later<00:05:22.350> on<00:05:22.590> I<00:05:22.920> can<00:05:23.250> go<00:05:23.520> over<00:05:23.550> to

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:23.730 
little bit and later on I can go over to

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.340 
little bit and later on I can go over to
the<00:05:23.850> computers<00:05:24.240> really<00:05:24.420> quickly<00:05:24.750> but<00:05:24.900> like<00:05:25.260> I

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
the computers really quickly but like I

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:26.990 
the computers really quickly but like I
said<00:05:25.500> I'll<00:05:25.590> do<00:05:25.710> the<00:05:25.800> video<00:05:26.310> adding<00:05:26.760> little<00:05:26.850> bit

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
said I'll do the video adding little bit

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.800 
said I'll do the video adding little bit
later<00:05:27.150> on<00:05:27.240> on<00:05:27.570> as<00:05:27.990> far<00:05:28.200> as<00:05:28.410> I<00:05:28.620> can<00:05:29.370> cure<00:05:29.810> pretty

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
later on on as far as I can cure pretty

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.390 
later on on as far as I can cure pretty
much<00:05:30.990> any<00:05:31.260> modern<00:05:31.620> computer<00:05:32.040> should<00:05:32.250> be<00:05:32.340> able

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
much any modern computer should be able

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.280 
much any modern computer should be able
to<00:05:32.520> video<00:05:32.820> at<00:05:32.970> it<00:05:33.090> that's<00:05:33.630> that's<00:05:33.930> kind<00:05:34.170> of<00:05:34.200> a

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
to video at it that's that's kind of a

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:35.480 
to video at it that's that's kind of a
broad<00:05:34.410> statement<00:05:34.650> but<00:05:34.980> it's<00:05:35.130> pretty<00:05:35.340> much

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
broad statement but it's pretty much

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.580 
broad statement but it's pretty much
true<00:05:35.760> I<00:05:35.850> mean<00:05:36.060> everything<00:05:36.720> from<00:05:36.930> an<00:05:37.050> iPhone

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 
true I mean everything from an iPhone

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.790 
true I mean everything from an iPhone
and<00:05:37.980> iPad<00:05:38.490> all<00:05:39.420> the<00:05:39.600> way<00:05:39.690> you<00:05:39.750> know<00:05:39.960> to<00:05:40.020> laptops

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
and iPad all the way you know to laptops

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.290 
and iPad all the way you know to laptops
and<00:05:41.040> even<00:05:41.100> desktops<00:05:41.670> should<00:05:41.970> be<00:05:42.060> able<00:05:42.150> to

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
and even desktops should be able to

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.860 
and even desktops should be able to
video<00:05:42.690> edit<00:05:43.080> basically<00:05:44.040> now<00:05:44.820> obviously<00:05:45.690> the

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
video edit basically now obviously the

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.450 
video edit basically now obviously the
faster<00:05:46.110> the<00:05:46.350> computer<00:05:46.440> you<00:05:46.770> have<00:05:46.980> the<00:05:47.250> newer

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
faster the computer you have the newer

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.860 
faster the computer you have the newer
it<00:05:47.610> is<00:05:47.730> more<00:05:48.090> likely<00:05:48.420> it's<00:05:48.510> going<00:05:48.660> to<00:05:48.720> work

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
it is more likely it's going to work

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.810 
it is more likely it's going to work
better<00:05:49.080> than<00:05:49.320> something<00:05:49.530> old<00:05:49.830> so<00:05:50.610> in<00:05:50.730> this

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
better than something old so in this

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.850 
better than something old so in this
case<00:05:51.060> usually<00:05:51.810> just<00:05:52.260> try<00:05:52.410> it<00:05:52.530> on<00:05:52.650> your

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
case usually just try it on your

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.380 
case usually just try it on your
computer<00:05:52.980> right<00:05:53.370> now<00:05:53.430> if<00:05:53.910> you<00:05:54.090> see<00:05:54.120> it's

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:54.390 
computer right now if you see it's

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:55.880 
computer right now if you see it's
really<00:05:54.660> lagging<00:05:54.870> it's<00:05:55.110> really<00:05:55.320> glitchy<00:05:55.620> you

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:55.890 
really lagging it's really glitchy you

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:57.200 
really lagging it's really glitchy you
know<00:05:55.980> you<00:05:56.100> might<00:05:56.250> have<00:05:56.280> to<00:05:56.520> know<00:05:56.760> improvise

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
know you might have to know improvise

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.090 
know you might have to know improvise
but<00:05:57.510> if<00:05:57.870> you<00:05:58.020> have<00:05:58.110> a<00:05:58.140> newer<00:05:58.350> computer

00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.100 
but if you have a newer computer

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.650 
but if you have a newer computer
especially<00:05:59.520> if<00:05:59.730> it's<00:05:59.850> been<00:05:59.910> bought<00:06:00.270> in<00:06:00.300> last

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 
especially if it's been bought in last

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.140 
especially if it's been bought in last
year<00:06:01.320> two<00:06:01.620> years<00:06:01.650> or<00:06:01.980> so<00:06:02.100> more<00:06:02.880> than<00:06:02.970> likely

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
year two years or so more than likely

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:04.460 
year two years or so more than likely
unless<00:06:03.510> it's<00:06:03.690> a<00:06:03.750> netbook<00:06:04.020> you're<00:06:04.170> going<00:06:04.320> to<00:06:04.380> be

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470 
unless it's a netbook you're going to be

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.020 
unless it's a netbook you're going to be
able<00:06:04.530> to<00:06:04.710> do<00:06:04.830> some<00:06:05.010> decent<00:06:05.160> video<00:06:05.550> editing<00:06:05.880> and

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
able to do some decent video editing and

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.660 
able to do some decent video editing and
of<00:06:06.150> course<00:06:06.360> like<00:06:06.540> I<00:06:06.630> said<00:06:06.660> as<00:06:07.020> you<00:06:07.340> move<00:06:08.340> on<00:06:08.460> as

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:08.670 
of course like I said as you move on as

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.850 
of course like I said as you move on as
you<00:06:08.790> get<00:06:09.060> nicer<00:06:09.330> computers<00:06:09.750> and<00:06:09.900> whatnot<00:06:10.230> you

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
you get nicer computers and whatnot you

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.230 
you get nicer computers and whatnot you
can<00:06:11.010> certainly<00:06:11.280> do<00:06:11.430> video<00:06:11.700> editing<00:06:11.730> much

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 
can certainly do video editing much

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.210 
can certainly do video editing much
faster<00:06:12.750> to<00:06:12.840> take<00:06:13.020> you<00:06:13.140> less<00:06:13.260> time<00:06:13.290> do<00:06:13.980> more

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 
faster to take you less time do more

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.250 
faster to take you less time do more
