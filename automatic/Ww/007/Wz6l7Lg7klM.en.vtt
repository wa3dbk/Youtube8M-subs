least<00:05:24.260> with<00:05:24.530> the<00:05:24.680> Samsung<00:05:25.160> Note<00:05:25.370> 2<00:05:26.200> awesome<00:05:27.200> I

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350 
least with the Samsung Note 2 awesome I

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.210

think<00:05:27.830> it'd<00:05:27.950> be<00:05:27.979> done<00:05:28.220> with<00:05:28.400> the<00:05:28.520> s3<00:05:28.940> as<00:05:29.150> well

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
think it'd be done with the s3 as well

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.100 
think it'd be done with the s3 as well
so<00:05:31.220> anyways<00:05:31.520> it's<00:05:31.970> the<00:05:32.210> greatest<00:05:32.419> feature<00:05:32.750> for
