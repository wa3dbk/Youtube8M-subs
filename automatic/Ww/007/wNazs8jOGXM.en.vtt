 Hello and welcome to 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.219
 windows pc 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.209
 Today we want to show you how they are 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.720
 linkages for the autostart 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.369
 Add programs to windows 8 bands 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.279
 can 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.869
 under windows 7 that was simply the 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.880
 links for autostart 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.150
 to add and the windows 8 is that 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.100
 whole already a little more complicated and 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.600
 are hidden autostart programs 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:39.730
 they can decide or 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.090
 Add links that say they are 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.950
 I want that program myself 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.710
 do not start automatically with the pc 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.410
 as soon as I start my pc 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:54.250
 different programs like office or 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.920
 excel or it opens my favorite 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.780
 video or whatever you can 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.600
 with the links in the autostart 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:05.320
 We'll show how it works 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.850
 in addition the windows key r button in common 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.270
 to press 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:14.320
 then enter here 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:16.990
 colon start up and say enter and 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.270
 already we are here in autostart like her 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.590
 I see everything empty now 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.979
 by taking everything out 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:28.060
 as an example I can now in 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:30.100
 right back the videos heard them 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.860
 to the left or from left to right 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:39.729
 or I say right mouse button and says 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:46.390
 new link there already 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:51.100
 windows explorer is here link 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:54.430
 then I say search I take so much 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:59.009
 videos as example says these videos 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.009
 okay, then I'll go on 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.990
 we open up 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.060
 and we already have the link here 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.300
 for our videos that means as soon as I am 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.000
 Now your pc savings open my 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.680
 videos the window of the videos that 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.900
 Of course you can do it with many others 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.230
 I can do music for example 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:38.720
 Likewise , that's music I say 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:40.370
 here and say here and say here and 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.510
 Now I have a link in here 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.490
 the autostart folder 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.610
 Of course you can do that with all yours 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:49.340
 make files and save yourself so 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.650
 each time to open the whole by hand 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.430
