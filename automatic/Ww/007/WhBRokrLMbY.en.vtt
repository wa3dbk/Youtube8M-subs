00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
 Hello everyone, it's cocof and I 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.170
 you presented a part of world of 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.450
 tanks that I realized with my 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.410
 usual playmates alan kieffer 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.480
 and captain planet 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.969
 so here we do not see it because on 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.730
 xbm the ratios of the players are not 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.780
 shown on them on the replays so puts 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.980
 on paper it was a won part 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.199
 advanced because we had a team 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.369
 almost all the players were in 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.560
 green in their green ratio 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.269
 overall while in the opposing team 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.210
 where he was almost all in the red 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.619
 good then by cons from the beginning its 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.920
 a little twist and since 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.300
 at one day had t28 that made a tail of 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.700
 fish and have to shoot 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.649
 my colleague and complete so that's good 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.129
 annoys me and I do not decide because he has 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.149
 fired a shell on my colleague 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:42.840
 you're going to tell me it's not the same 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.000
 caliber 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.170
 it's not very fair I agree 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.460
 but it still relieves the same time 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.079
 tea 28 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.059
 it's unhealthy kind of shit you have to 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.860
 well say but attracts me frame that on 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.870
 a third party hills they would have 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.550
 certainly he really nothing and saw the 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.840
 pilot quality I think I have 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.640
 to definitely improve our chances of 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.000
 win by getting rid of this 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.900
 andouille so there you see I call 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.400
 bad to drive but that's because I 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.400
 am trying to explain why I am 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.110
 got rid of this player there early in 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.979
 the part I prefer to explain for 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.080
 avoid shooting me in the 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.360
 back and so there we see that the team 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.680
 it's fine to deploy more 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.570
 of competent players' efforts to 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.210
 the team since the majority 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.770
 the team is holding the crest and so we have a 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.590
 good little expeditionary corps that is going 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.960
 attack the hill with so a l4 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.090
 isolated in the pool still down 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.590
 the map that controls the area and which 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.119
 prevents the half of approaching and therefore 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.520
 age is advancing towards the hill for 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.979
 take the position and thus prevent the 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.650
 advanced friends the surprise a case well 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.310
 is this pebble teams shoot on 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.510
 alas in Cambodia to all so 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.820
 that he was covered in the process of 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.920
 fold down with his frontal merry-go-round 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.200
 was presenting so it's really big shot 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.240
 this is the big advantage 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.290
 of the cab's cannon and two yes but at 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.690
 less 20 seconds to recharge it 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.420
 is not accurate but has potential 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.840
 damage of 850 cantons use the 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.869
 shopping and so not regularly on 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.950
 gets to a shot one shots 6 so 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.810
 it's like playing especially 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.740
 good pleasure I pass it he has a lot 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.870
 appreciated but I really appreciated 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.000
 so we keep going 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.680
 what hills battle so so soon 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.020
 that we evoke continuity we draw on the 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.550
 guy coming forward we're filling up 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.570
 so that's the scic so that's where I know 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.480
 not if you saw but there is a third 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.260
 who touched me so on moment I 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.300
 do not understand where he comes from 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.040
 because if I had someone behind 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.890
 me normally colleagues would have 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.730
 had the spot good time I'm not worried 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.180
 because the case but stays ahead and 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.590
 more annoying and so there I took a 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.720
 shot from behind 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.030
 I'm not surprised what I managed to 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.989
 let go of that is pretty good and so 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.230
 I'm trying to understand a little where 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:57.250
 come from where do these shots come from 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.540
 no explanation but really good 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.940
 the agent of the hill to try to 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.940
 replace some small pralines 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.370
 on the enemy is there so hello my 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.599
 colleague who is taking a friendly shot I 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.549
 begins to understand that it's not a 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.599
 enemy who would agitate behind 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:11.370
 we but it's a colleague who tells us 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:15.370
 shoot on it 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.440
 so I compensate a little bit to 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.640
 worry 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.670
 the shot that goes west we do not know 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:26.950
 why does this happen so I look at it 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:28.299
 there is nothing or I do not understand it is 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.560
 the advantage of the kavÃ© of one still has the 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:32.110
 time to do something else while 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.819
 incurs charge so here it starts a 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.440
 frankly annoy me since so the 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.000
 shot was like to hurt and so I 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.260
 see finally that it is the marker of 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.299
 kings who shot me 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.769
 so after I checked by stopping 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.290
 and I realized that in fact the bar 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.730
 dirt 2 it was the platoon colleague of the 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.530
 t2 told me that I was going to taste at the beginning 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.060
 the eric part there i start to get some 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:54.280
 fed up and I ask that cohabitants 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:56.770
 since by force and the enslaved a lot of 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.750
 my beautiful eyes and place allies 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.150
 meetic dinette good to eliminate the 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.360
 marker from there we can 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.740
 start playing so we see they 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:10.270
 are who are 5 in front of 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:12.010
 we do not hurt but 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.530
 good slowly drinking has 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.530
 managed to get rid 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:19.989
 good I advance I take to say I leave 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.540
 a little bit the game is going on 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.980
 normally we see that so on the 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.100
 remains the map colleagues have well 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:29.470
 managed to learn on the offensive since 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.610
 they are approaching the area 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.620
 of course and they are eliminating 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.940
 a little by little the rest of the team 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.940
 when that's it it's really good 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.030
 so here I use a technique 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.800
 classic which is actually I use my 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.200
 colleague as complicated as he 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.960
 started and it allows me two 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.160
 focus my shot the crutches this recoil I 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.680
 can not launch the praline and then in 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:56.410
 the occurrence completed the gers insight 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:58.810
 was suffering so the ceiba it's starting to get 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.250
 decant quite a lot since we still have 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.420
 eliminated to players of the opposing team 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.790
 above powerful 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.640
 now that losses in addition to 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.810
 teammates that's good wife then 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.580
 eliminated the sucking milk there that comes from 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:14.780
 what just echoed lake 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:17.680
 it's not very good several months ago 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.680
 since you could buy me 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:28.000
 so that's the case but one moves forward 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:30.020
 actually kill and problem is that the stock 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.720
 priori can do nothing about swimming at 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:37.460
 sold therefore knew that I will have 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.760
 I go there so I'll go ucl and get 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.570
 remember to shoot so ben I go 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.070
 let's say I'll try to 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:46.250
 own the shot as soon as I have the 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.720
 opportunity I pull is what good is needed 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.120
 especially not leave as much water 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.530
 of rj harley and so the bomb at the 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:55.640
 part is folded since it remains that 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:57.650
 more than two survivors have against no 

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.820
 count all our team that's okay 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.130
 will quickly make good dishes 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.660
 I go but it will not do much to 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:06.260
 really miss me in a corner and then 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:10.460
 will come out magazine it's won here's the 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:13.510
 last 34 and here is the party is over 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.510
 a nice little victory
