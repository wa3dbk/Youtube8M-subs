 hurry to bake these pizzas 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.799
 best not on the baking sheet because 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.289
 if you put them on a baking sheet and cinco 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.299

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:36.610
 add more cheese and of course 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.350
 add sausage and in order to 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.600
 emphasize the miniature of our pizza 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.600
 use a thin hunting sausage 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.590
 such pizzas are simply made for parties 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.240
 very budget and tasty option 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.610
 use and no one will 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.190
 hungry that's all pizza is almost done 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.600
 put it in the oven 5 minus 180 degrees 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.920
 if you cook for the first time see 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.229
 more attentively she can and is preparing 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.320
 faster watch and the cheese melted can 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.180
 pick up while pizzas are quickly cooked in 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.490
 the oven suggest you make a drink 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.770
 it will be such a drink 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.750
 In summer, tarragon is such a grass and still can 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.550
 find called tarragon for sale 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.170
 the market is wonderful and very helpful 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.590
 to cook from tarhuna 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.150
 its drink needs to be crushed and 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.400
 then put in a mortar where to grind with 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.350
 sugar in order to get more juice 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.290
 and vitamins I beg you not to torture and 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.540
 tarragon don't boil it don't get all 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.950
 benefit and you will have just compote 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.150
 strange smell 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.150
 add sugar 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.909
 From Istra, we took the best brand 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.569
 the aroma is already here and now we shift 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:44.489
 tarragon in a pitcher in which there is already ice 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.890
 here we add lemon juice and now 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:50.480
 fill it all with sparkling water either 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.480
 same usually any such you like 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.400
 awesome color and very refreshing 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.930
 aroma is the most useful drink 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.720
 which you can drink in the heat 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.879
 here it only seemed good to me 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.280
 that only refreshes the meat now I know 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:08.209
 that perfectly refreshes and tones 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.209

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.340
