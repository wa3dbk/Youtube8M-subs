00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
iPhones and iPad and stuff like that

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.600 
iPhones and iPad and stuff like that
they<00:00:33.000> have<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.180> conference<00:00:33.840> in<00:00:34.579> September<00:00:35.579> I

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
they have a conference in September I

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.740 
they have a conference in September I

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
believe was like September 17th in 2013

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.720 
believe was like September 17th in 2013
so<00:00:40.170> probably<00:00:40.829> around<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.250> mid-september

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
so probably around the mid-september

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:42.709 
so probably around the mid-september
around<00:00:42.390> there

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
around there

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.590 
around there
the<00:00:43.290> price<00:00:43.500> could<00:00:44.430> obviously<00:00:44.820> most<00:00:45.239> likely

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
the price could obviously most likely

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.600 
the price could obviously most likely
stay<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.840> same<00:00:46.050> as<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.590> iPhone<00:00:46.710> 5s<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.370> right

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
stay the same as the iPhone 5s is right

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.850 
stay the same as the iPhone 5s is right
now<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:48.500> $719<00:00:49.500> for<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.890> 16<00:00:50.449> 819<00:00:51.449> for<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.350> 32

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
now so $719 for the 16 819 for the 32

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.760 
now so $719 for the 16 819 for the 32
and<00:00:52.890> 919<00:00:53.760> for<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.000> 64<00:00:54.539> these<00:00:55.320> are<00:00:55.530> Canadian

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
and 919 for the 64 these are Canadian

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.529 
and 919 for the 64 these are Canadian
prices<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:56.579> in<00:00:56.670> America<00:00:57.030> it's<00:00:57.120> 20<00:00:57.390> bucks

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
prices so in America it's 20 bucks

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.490 
prices so in America it's 20 bucks
cheaper<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:58.199> $6.99<00:00:58.829> $7.99<00:00:59.489> $8.99<00:01:00.480> going<00:01:01.320> into

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
cheaper so $6.99 $7.99 $8.99 going into

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.130 
cheaper so $6.99 $7.99 $8.99 going into
specs<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:02.070> should<00:01:02.340> expect<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.670> 4.7<00:01:03.300> inch<00:01:03.570> ultra

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
specs you should expect a 4.7 inch ultra

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.500 
specs you should expect a 4.7 inch ultra

expect<00:01:55.590> much<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.430> difference<00:01:56.880> like<00:01:57.210> as<00:01:57.509> you

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
expect much of a difference like as you

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.539 
expect much of a difference like as you

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
guys remember Iowa's 4 was released in

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.810 
guys remember Iowa's 4 was released in
iOS<00:02:00.149> 5<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.540> 6<00:02:00.960> we're<00:02:01.140> very<00:02:01.530> similar<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:02.189> iOS<00:02:02.310> 4

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820

iOS 5 and 6 we're very similar to iOS 4
so<00:02:03.420> with<00:02:03.600> iOS<00:02:03.960> 8<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.229> expected<00:02:04.770> like<00:02:04.799> minor

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
so with iOS 8 I expected like minor

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.950 
so with iOS 8 I expected like minor
changes<00:02:05.640> maybe<00:02:05.850> like<00:02:06.149> being<00:02:06.390> able<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.750> hide

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960

you<00:02:09.289> know<00:02:09.409> maybe<00:02:10.009> group<00:02:10.399> based<00:02:10.640> on<00:02:10.849> calls<00:02:11.180> like

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
you know maybe group based on calls like

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.149 
you know maybe group based on calls like
