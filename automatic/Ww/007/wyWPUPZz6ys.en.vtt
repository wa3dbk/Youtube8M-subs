00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
special elsewhere but it's just the norm

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
logically my head I'm thinking two

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.070 
logically my head I'm thinking two
schools<00:02:27.400> possibly<00:02:27.790> three<00:02:28.000> twice<00:02:28.810> as<00:02:28.959> much

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
schools possibly three twice as much

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.330 
schools possibly three twice as much
work<00:02:29.290> three<00:02:29.590> times<00:02:29.620> as<00:02:29.920> much<00:02:30.069> is<00:02:30.250> that<00:02:30.400> is<00:02:30.550> it

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
work three times as much is that is it

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.050 
work three times as much is that is it
you<00:02:33.340> could<00:02:33.520> see<00:02:33.700> it<00:02:33.760> like<00:02:33.850> that

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
you could see it like that

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.490 
you could see it like that
although<00:02:34.450> it's<00:02:34.600> three<00:02:34.990> times<00:02:35.230> as<00:02:35.380> many

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
although it's three times as many

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.260 
although it's three times as many
resources<00:02:35.709> three<00:02:36.220> times<00:02:36.459> as<00:02:36.610> many<00:02:36.700> students

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
resources three times as many students

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.240 
resources three times as many students
just<00:02:37.600> lots<00:02:38.140> of<00:02:38.230> different<00:02:38.560> experiences<00:02:38.680> that

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
just lots of different experiences that

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.710 
just lots of different experiences that
you<00:02:39.340> can<00:02:39.459> bring<00:02:39.610> together<00:02:39.790> and<00:02:40.120> build<00:02:40.270> on<00:02:40.420> so

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
you can bring together and build on so

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.979
