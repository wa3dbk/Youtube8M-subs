too is that they won't take or clot on a
moist<00:03:13.430> face<00:03:13.819> so<00:03:14.120> that's<00:03:14.300> they<00:03:14.629> actually<00:03:15.110> do

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
moist face so that's they actually do

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.839

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
stay away from things like olive oils

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:32.860 
stay away from things like olive oils
and<00:03:31.819> things<00:03:31.940> like<00:03:32.120> that<00:03:32.329> that<00:03:32.450> you<00:03:32.540> might<00:03:32.690> put

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
and things like that that you might put

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.539 
and things like that that you might put
on<00:03:32.930> for<00:03:33.200> like<00:03:33.380> a<00:03:33.410> heavier<00:03:33.829> moisturizing<00:03:34.430> like

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
on for like a heavier moisturizing like

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.550 
on for like a heavier moisturizing like
at<00:03:34.700> night<00:03:34.880> time<00:03:35.150> but<00:03:35.750> I<00:03:35.810> would<00:03:35.959> recommend<00:03:36.110> it

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
at night time but I would recommend it

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.800 
at night time but I would recommend it
for<00:03:36.709> day<00:03:36.860> wear<00:03:37.099> when<00:03:38.030> dealing<00:03:38.239> with<00:03:38.420> mineral

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
for day wear when dealing with mineral

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.850 
for day wear when dealing with mineral
makeup<00:03:39.140> products<00:03:41.290> and<00:03:42.290> I<00:03:42.500> think<00:03:42.709> that's

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
makeup products and I think that's

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.319 
makeup products and I think that's
pretty<00:03:43.040> good<00:03:43.160> for<00:03:43.310> right<00:03:43.549> now<00:03:43.700> so<00:03:43.970> I<00:03:44.269> will

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
pretty good for right now so I will

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:47.110 
pretty good for right now so I will
continue<00:03:44.959> with<00:03:45.170> my<00:03:45.349> concealing<00:03:45.980> and<00:03:46.160> then

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
continue with my concealing and then

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.990 
continue with my concealing and then
we'll<00:03:47.390> go<00:03:47.660> on<00:03:47.870> to<00:03:47.900> doing<00:03:48.739> the<00:03:49.310> entire<00:03:49.640> face

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
we'll go on to doing the entire face

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.940 
we'll go on to doing the entire face
with<00:03:50.390> our<00:03:50.629> foundation<00:03:51.019> and<00:03:51.440> that<00:03:51.590> will<00:03:51.709> be<00:03:51.829> our

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
with our foundation and that will be our

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.860 
with our foundation and that will be our
next<00:03:52.099> tutorial<00:03:52.670> so<00:03:55.269> I'll<00:03:56.269> see<00:03:56.450> it<00:03:56.569> the<00:03:56.690> next

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870
