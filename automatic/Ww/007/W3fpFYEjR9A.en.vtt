00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 Hello friends visiting fox 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.259
 now i'm so delicious i'll show mine 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.769
 very best loved ones 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:14.490
 go soon and so i will need 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.369
 blueberries the more blueberries the better not 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.590
 a bucket of course so a few spoons she 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.449
 already wash it then you can take and 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.109
 frozen blueberries if you will 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.449
 do it out of season 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:31.140
 next I cash blueberries add a spoon 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.660
 sugar you can add honey or honestly 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.230
 speaking with sugar that's tastier somehow 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.260
 because sugar is just sweet and he doesn't 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.410
 interrupts the taste of blueberry but honey 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.899
 have their own distinct taste and that 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.719
 blueberries will kill a little but 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.629
 Of course with honey is more useful and like this 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.079
 neatly on the side of the bowl 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:58.320
 we crush our blueberries and not 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.390
 be sure to crush all the berries so 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.799
 more or less crush her 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.510
 and mix sugar and more sugar 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.479
 add if you want 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.960
 now we pour natural here 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:19.560
 plain yogurt or kefir any 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:23.640
 fat mix and add 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:28.580
 a few tablespoons of oatmeal 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.580
 or you can mix the flakes to use 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:37.079
 shuffle don't make too thick 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.439
 because the flakes brew swell and 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:46.500
 increase in size 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:49.049
 Kefir is absorbed accordingly 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.770
 it turned out to be a miracle 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.990
 stand for 20 minutes at least to cereal 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.310
 ok set you may wonder but 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.950
 it turns out very tasty especially so 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.490
 I love but marmalade fox love 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.220
 not crush the berries but simply first 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.270
 pour yogurt or kefir flakes 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.610
 leave 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.370
 infuse and then add berries and 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.350
 sprinkle with sugar 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.050
 how would she like it when she eats 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.050
 such whole berries fall into her mouth she 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.850
 it bites through and they are sour there 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.520
 squirting juice is generally very tasty and 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.830
 juicy and I love the opposite so that 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.080
 blueberries mixed with sugar and there 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.090
 don't feel sour choose with me 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.170
 own option 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.070
 enjoy be healthy and happy 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.070
 until
