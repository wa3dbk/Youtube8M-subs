now<00:00:57.400> what<00:00:57.820> we're<00:00:57.909> going<00:00:58.030> to<00:00:58.059> do<00:00:58.299> is<00:00:59.280> when<00:01:00.280> we

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.400 
now what we're going to do is when we

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.609 
now what we're going to do is when we
hit<00:01:00.519> start<00:01:00.940> it's<00:01:01.150> going<00:01:01.360> to<00:01:01.449> be<00:01:02.080> an<00:01:02.199> arrow<00:01:02.440> that

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:02.619 
hit start it's going to be an arrow that

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:04.109 
hit start it's going to be an arrow that
comes<00:01:02.860> up<00:01:03.040> and<00:01:03.220> we're<00:01:03.309> going<00:01:03.489> to<00:01:03.549> rotate<00:01:03.729> the

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
comes up and we're going to rotate the

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:11.190 
comes up and we're going to rotate the
unit<00:01:04.979> counterclockwise<00:01:05.979> and<00:01:09.870> keep<00:01:10.870> the<00:01:11.020> arrow

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
unit counterclockwise and keep the arrow

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.630 
unit counterclockwise and keep the arrow
pointing<00:01:11.860> at<00:01:12.100> us<00:01:12.460> so<00:01:14.160> once<00:01:15.160> we're<00:01:15.310> ready<00:01:15.340> for

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
pointing at us so once we're ready for

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.180 
pointing at us so once we're ready for
that<00:01:15.760> and<00:01:15.940> the<00:01:16.500> bubble<00:01:17.500> is<00:01:17.620> in<00:01:17.650> the<00:01:17.800> center<00:01:18.130> of

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
that and the bubble is in the center of

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.160 
that and the bubble is in the center of
the<00:01:18.280> screen<00:01:18.490> like<00:01:19.000> we<00:01:19.060> see<00:01:19.330> there<00:01:19.570> go<00:01:20.110> ahead

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
the screen like we see there go ahead

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.540 
the screen like we see there go ahead
and<00:01:20.320> hit<00:01:20.470> start<00:01:20.770> and<00:01:21.660> there's<00:01:22.660> the<00:01:22.840> arrow<00:01:23.550> so

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
and hit start and there's the arrow so

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.780 
and hit start and there's the arrow so
we'll<00:01:25.060> just<00:01:25.240> swing<00:01:26.020> unit<00:01:26.470> around<00:01:26.800> and<00:01:27.580> keep

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
we'll just swing unit around and keep

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.780 
we'll just swing unit around and keep
that<00:01:28.000> black<00:01:28.300> arrow<00:01:28.660> on<00:01:29.110> the<00:01:29.230> outside<00:01:29.790> pointing

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
that black arrow on the outside pointing

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.750 
that black arrow on the outside pointing
at<00:01:30.940> us<00:01:31.020> as<00:01:32.020> we<00:01:32.170> turn<00:01:32.380> it<00:01:32.590> and<00:01:33.460> you'll<00:01:33.550> notice

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
at us as we turn it and you'll notice

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.950 
at us as we turn it and you'll notice
the<00:01:34.650> red<00:01:35.650> stripes<00:01:36.640> beginning<00:01:37.030> to<00:01:37.120> appear<00:01:37.600> in

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
the red stripes beginning to appear in

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.540 
the red stripes beginning to appear in
the<00:01:38.610> center<00:01:39.610> of<00:01:39.700> the<00:01:39.820> unit<00:01:40.380> when<00:01:41.380> it's

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
the center of the unit when it's

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.470 
the center of the unit when it's
calibrated<00:01:42.550> it'll<00:01:42.790> be<00:01:42.880> a<00:01:42.909> completely<00:01:43.630> red<00:01:45.480> and

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 
calibrated it'll be a completely red and

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.420 
calibrated it'll be a completely red and
we're<00:01:47.200> just<00:01:47.350> about<00:01:47.530> ready<00:01:50.010> I'll<00:01:51.010> strive<00:01:51.310> to

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
we're just about ready I'll strive to

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.750 
we're just about ready I'll strive to
fill<00:01:51.670> it<00:01:51.760> in<00:01:51.880> and<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:53.770> will<00:01:53.979> then<00:01:54.010> give<00:01:54.430> us<00:01:54.670> a

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
fill it in and that will then give us a

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.030 
fill it in and that will then give us a
message<00:01:55.090> saying<00:01:55.360> turn<00:01:55.690> the<00:01:55.870> unit<00:01:56.110> over<00:01:56.290> and

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
message saying turn the unit over and

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.230 
message saying turn the unit over and
wait<00:01:57.159> for<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.400> beep<00:01:57.580> to<00:01:57.850> complete

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
wait for the beep to complete

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.289 
wait for the beep to complete
calibration<00:01:58.990> so<00:01:59.350> go<00:02:00.040> ahead<00:02:00.130> and<00:02:00.340> do<00:02:00.460> that

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:07.480 

and<00:02:05.299> there's<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:05.960> beep<00:02:06.140> so<00:02:06.619> we<00:02:06.890> turn<00:02:07.159> the<00:02:07.310> unit

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
and there's the beep so we turn the unit

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.729 
and there's the beep so we turn the unit
back<00:02:07.640> over<00:02:08.000> and<00:02:08.349> it<00:02:09.349> would<00:02:09.440> give<00:02:09.619> us<00:02:09.709> the

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
back over and it would give us the

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.890 
back over and it would give us the
message<00:02:10.130> saying<00:02:10.630> calibration<00:02:11.630> was

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
message saying calibration was

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.100 
message saying calibration was
successful<00:02:12.680> so<00:02:13.010> I<00:02:13.069> just<00:02:13.220> hit<00:02:13.400> OK<00:02:13.819> and<00:02:14.060> then<00:02:14.959> we

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
successful so I just hit OK and then we

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.900 
successful so I just hit OK and then we
are<00:02:15.440> ready<00:02:15.470> to<00:02:15.830> use<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.130> compass<00:02:16.519> and<00:02:16.670> you<00:02:16.730> can

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
are ready to use the compass and you can

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.110 
are ready to use the compass and you can
see<00:02:17.090> once<00:02:17.780> it's<00:02:17.930> calibrated<00:02:18.530> just<00:02:19.340> by<00:02:19.519> turning

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
see once it's calibrated just by turning

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.920 
see once it's calibrated just by turning
the<00:02:20.180> GPS<00:02:20.769> the<00:02:21.769> compass<00:02:22.099> will<00:02:22.280> rotate<00:02:22.400> so<00:02:23.000> which

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
the GPS the compass will rotate so which

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.180 
the GPS the compass will rotate so which
direction<00:02:24.519> they're<00:02:25.519> pointing<00:02:26.769> and<00:02:27.769> then<00:02:28.010> to

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
direction they're pointing and then to

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.650 
direction they're pointing and then to
get<00:02:28.310> back<00:02:28.489> to<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:28.730> main<00:02:28.880> map<00:02:29.090> screen<00:02:29.360> where<00:02:29.630> we

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
get back to the main map screen where we

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.990 
get back to the main map screen where we
started<00:02:30.050> just<00:02:30.680> hit<00:02:30.980> either<00:02:31.970> page<00:02:32.390> or<00:02:32.720> escape

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
started just hit either page or escape

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.160 
started just hit either page or escape
until<00:02:35.000> we<00:02:35.209> get<00:02:35.360> back<00:02:35.720> to<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.319> main<00:02:36.950> map
