00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.660
 very good guys from the minecraft drone 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.000
 back a new program 1.7 point 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.950
 10 called green sportium works with 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.419
 forge so I'm not going to download it for 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.720
 true beyond the name is great in 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:24.860
 English is weird is weird the thing is this 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.200
 what it does is make the 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.790
 fortune charm work with the 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.320
 iron man and those of gold you know 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.360
 that in the order of iron and gold lore 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.770
 when chopping them gives us the block so 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.230
 both the enchantment fortune as 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.059
 it only works with items because we do not 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.190
 In this case, however, with this 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.920
 module that it does is instead of when what 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.109
 let's apply give us the order of the block 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.730
 It gives us an item that has created the mod 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:48.739
 for this occasion, we have an ideal 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.999
 for the order of gold and britten for the 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.670
 iron leds in this case I will look 

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:54.350
 the name would be the goal of the anp and by 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.999
 another side we have the iron land would be 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.399
 like fragments of gold fragments of 

00:00:55.999 --> 00:01:00.829
 iron but still as with stone 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.510
 still not fully refined 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.129
 So what do we do then? 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.960
 what we did with the gold order or I 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.210
 iron I still do not know if with this 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.380
 mode will work just as before 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.600
 say now we will take the block by 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.850
 example here and here and we put in first 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.940
 place the goal down so you can see that 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.030
 this with coal that catch it itself 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.340
 is going to become the gold ingot 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.230
 we put it here perfect and of 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.910
 here I can no longer do I have to do the 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.410
 duplication here in this part and here in 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:31.850
 this part after we're going to put in this 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:33.830
 case the iron fragment or the iron 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.710
 lab in this case and you are going to see that 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.330
 transform into the gold ingot and into the 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.470
 bullion of money respectively if 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.270
 I put the gold mine here too 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.470
 it works so if we have it in front of 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.570
 install the mode it works 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.210
 correctly however if we have a 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.460
 peak of fortune in this case or luck 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.140
 what would be the translation in Spanish then 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.120
 we can get much more materials 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.790
 for example if I give your new and 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.220
 I start to apply from gold then in 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.320
 this case I skip more than 1 voucher not 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.210
 always sometimes but sometimes not 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.490
 loose more than one unit and as you see 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.960
 we can get more gold than what 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.000
 we could get before it is 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.130
 we would have to always bite from one in 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.470
 One and always I will only give you one 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.700
 of gold not then with gold works 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.130
 also with the iron as you are going to see 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.150
 now how do you see we have chopped two dice 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.220
 because we have not had any luck 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.100
 now we have if we still have three 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.390
 to see now let's say that now we do have 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.980
 5 sada 2 in this case 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.110
 and as you can see it works perfectly 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.750
 however, it also adds a 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.550
 possibility that the peak counted that it 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.319
 so it also has more utilities 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.090
 because in this case if we want to take the 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.410
 gold instead of taking the item then 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.900
 we'll have to hit him with a pick 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.090
 touches of silk to give it to us and 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.100
 because now cristiando told that it happens 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.140
 it does not work it was supposed to work at 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.240
 except that what he says in it makes official 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.650
 of the mod I extend told that it is given to the 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.660
 you are seeing cheap that will be 5 you 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.450
 matter but what will be the cooked of the cne 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.180
 directly but it does not work 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.650
 because it is a bitch because this does not 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.480
 work because it has left me 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.130
 liar and apart because I do not know 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.510
 can get the man directly 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.980
 we can not decorate with these envelopes and 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.510
 we have this mode but good sesma 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.980
 guys do not have anything else anymore I hope that 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.180
 there has been a lot if you can 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.790
 press the favorite X, we do not see the 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.790
 next video and see you later
