 if you don't want to buy eggs from chickens 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.089
 grown on genetically modified 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.040
 feed or you too lazy to go after them in 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.420
 supermarket then a couple from pennsylvania 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.690
 there is a solution for you 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.280

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.800
 course rental with everything you need for 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.670
 keeping the birds their customers in several 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.550
 states of usa 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.359
 eat fresh eggs every day tom kin cheese 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.039
 and told rt about their business idea 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:28.830
 semi-annual rent of 2 layers costs from 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.080
 400 dollars two hens bear about 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.780
 dozens of eggs a week and although the cost 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.850
 such eggs are obtained above the store you 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.829
 still get some benefit in 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.230
 rent includes food without gmo 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.059
 and you no longer need to go anywhere 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.710
 for eggs 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.960
 Tomkins of customers no longer buy 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.550
 eggs in supermarkets and this is not the first 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.800
 a case when people prefer 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.110
 do without the services of intermediaries it 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.620
 a phenomenon called ubization by example 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.129
 The famous taxi is gaining popularity with 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.230
 there are now travelers 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.270
 alternative to hotels they can rent 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.219
 apartment or room directly from local 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.989
 residents there are companies that 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.540
 allow you to rent a tripod for 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.900
 camera or barbecue chairs in 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.030
 the garden 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.250
 while you do not need to pay the agency 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.439
 intermediary costly delivery 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.630
 goods or repair services may 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.310
 be a thing of the past because new 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.530
 business model allows 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.049
 find workers willing to work for 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.820
 less money journalist henry the coffin 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.600
 kind of said rt and gaining strength 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.820
 trends for me the main innovation 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.560
 who carry with them such services without 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.900
 intermediaries whether ordering a taxi and 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.540
 restaurant table or cleaning the apartment 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.829
 this flexible price is a real breakthrough 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.530
 as previously did not exist 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.060
 technology allows so fast to change 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.770
 value of goods or services in 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.930
 depending on demand taxi service uber 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.100
 among the first organizations abandoned 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.600
 from intermediaries 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.420
 now it is a huge international 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.549
 corporation brian karni term author 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.140
 clean economics organization told 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.140
 the pitfalls of this system 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.369
 we are already seeing indignation and I think she 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.869
 will only grow companies that 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.390
 accustomed to work under supervision 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.100
 regulatory bodies 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.319
 here to insist that their new 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.390
 competitors put in the same framework that 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.819
 concerns big business when in it 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.890
 dominated by powerful players it is always clear who 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.720
 guilty if something went wrong 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.569
 total control leads to nothing 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.910
 uber is unlikely to behave well 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.950
 better than any other monopolist I 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.230
 I hope that the market will be alive 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.990
 healthy competition and uber will 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.520
 restrain other companies without a doubt 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.620
 any corporation must bear 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.959
 responsibility for your actions is 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.420
 maybe because of competition 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:44.470
 I hope the elevator and other uber analogues 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.470
 stay on the market
