needs a sponge car replacement put in it
I'm<00:02:19.030> going<00:02:19.210> to<00:02:19.300> actually<00:02:19.420> set<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:19.870> box<00:02:20.140> top

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
I'm going to actually set the box top

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.309 
I'm going to actually set the box top
over<00:02:21.130> here

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.880 

here<00:02:24.859> are<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.099> manuals<00:02:25.569> hold<00:02:26.569> it

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
here are the manuals hold it

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.289 
here are the manuals hold it
unfortunately<00:02:27.890> but<00:02:28.519> that<00:02:28.700> will<00:02:28.819> flatten<00:02:29.060> out

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
unfortunately but that will flatten out

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:33.150 
unfortunately but that will flatten out
the<00:02:29.480> time<00:02:29.780> I'm<00:02:30.019> short

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.310 

this<00:02:33.370> is<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.760> carriage<00:02:34.510> for<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.020> river<00:02:35.200> I

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
this is the carriage for the river I

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.380 
this is the carriage for the river I
don't<00:02:35.590> know<00:02:35.710> why<00:02:35.830> that's<00:02:36.100> in<00:02:36.400> here<00:02:36.610> but<00:02:36.880> it

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
don't know why that's in here but it

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.800 
don't know why that's in here but it
does<00:02:37.750> this<00:02:38.190> way<00:02:39.190> and<00:02:40.180> again<00:02:40.390> this<00:02:40.510> is<00:02:40.690> the

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
does this way and again this is the

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.270 
does this way and again this is the
first<00:02:40.960> time<00:02:41.260> I'm<00:02:41.410> actually<00:02:41.590> opening<00:02:41.950> the

Machine up folio and going to work with
it<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:47.350> accessory<00:02:47.800> box<00:02:48.120> is<00:02:49.120> right<00:02:49.330> here<00:02:49.720> I'm

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
it the accessory box is right here I'm

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.800 
it the accessory box is right here I'm
actually<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:50.620> frame<00:02:50.860> is<00:02:51.010> over<00:02:51.370> to<00:02:52.210> the<00:02:52.300> camera

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
actually the frame is over to the camera

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.160 
actually the frame is over to the camera
and<00:02:53.110> show<00:02:54.070> it<00:02:54.220> close-up<00:02:54.700> on<00:02:54.880> this<00:02:55.150> box<00:02:55.390> so<00:02:56.140> you

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
and show it close-up on this box so you

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.910 
and show it close-up on this box so you
can<00:02:56.260> see<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:57.370> tools<00:02:57.640> are<00:02:57.880> all<00:02:57.910> in<00:02:58.180> here<00:02:58.920> I'll
