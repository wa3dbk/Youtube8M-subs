00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.470
 but then, for him, in principle, this is an encouraging attempt 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.810
 10 Augsburg bands with their own compositions 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:26.619
 in a completely different way, namely the bands 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.849
 to completely empty the singer and leave the band alone 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:33.970
 to replace an orchestra that is called 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:34.940
 tries 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.560
 to recognize the basic message of the units compositions 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.770
 to translate into the classic small 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.620
 and tries to put the singer on stage at that time 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.130
 Benefit consumers 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.770
 or what ever 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.940
 just strike 8 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.850
 musically we have never been told 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.430
 but to electronically point the head of the prevented is that 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.640
 there 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.640
 we know very different things that we cover 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.850
 Bjorn 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.850
 Federer served 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.990
 Dr 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.990
 r 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.460
 how they live through history though 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.750
 But far from these, a medially widespread picture is his 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.520
 Now not necessarily just the long way the pants dance around burning 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.270
 Garbage cans and so on 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.270
 around 1 4 million all clichÃ©s in the field 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.050
 With 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.780
 So now, with a practice round in the first total sample of 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.790
 this motto Make the Rounds a third penalty Yuki 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:11.459
 one would believe I say 'never say never' of music and will there be 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.159
 a nice or sport 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:16.429
 which should only try to accompany 

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:20.139
 Color swathe does not hold a club can on 12 

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:24.419
 ours now we only experience a trial run and it can be that 

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:27.419
 we get stuck but that's understood too 

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:35.679
 to tell 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.069
 the 1 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.709
 best actor 

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:52.599
 so gets the 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.719
 is not clear 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:57.719
 it counts 

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:05.769
 when he stopped after a turnaround 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:11.239
 The author reminds for Serena Chile absolute freedom one can I can 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.659
 do what I want probably came from Europe with wanting to achieve everything 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:20.590
 Artist Werner will slow down without anyone else then either 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.509
 enter 

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:25.579
 Together with the other musicians this is the way to have a very own experience 

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:29.579
 It was hard crashed and injured from the field 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.939
 At the end of September, his momentum has passed 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:54.480
 we want
