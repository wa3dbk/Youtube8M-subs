era<00:02:45.390> figures<00:02:45.840> I<00:02:45.930> thought<00:02:46.050> especially<00:02:46.500> for<00:02:46.680> the

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
era figures I thought especially for the

era figures I thought especially for the
period<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.850> lovely<00:02:48.120> thing<00:02:48.360> with<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.660> model

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
period the lovely thing with the model

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.930 
period the lovely thing with the model
six<00:02:49.170> mil<00:02:49.440> high<00:02:49.680> is<00:02:49.740> that<00:02:50.190> I<00:02:50.220> can<00:02:50.400> get<00:02:50.520> away<00:02:50.610> with

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
six mil high is that I can get away with

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.090 
six mil high is that I can get away with
this<00:02:51.090> sort<00:02:51.360> of<00:02:51.480> thing<00:02:51.770> there's<00:02:52.770> a<00:02:52.830> sliding

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
this sort of thing there's a sliding

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.710 
this sort of thing there's a sliding
measurement<00:02:53.610> scale<00:02:53.850> based<00:02:54.120> upon<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.480> model's

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
measurement scale based upon the model's

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.270 
measurement scale based upon the model's
own<00:02:54.870> base<00:02:55.080> width<00:02:55.380> so<00:02:55.710> you<00:02:55.770> can<00:02:55.980> use<00:02:56.100> pretty

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
own base width so you can use pretty

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.370 
own base width so you can use pretty
much<00:02:56.370> any<00:02:56.700> scale<00:02:57.030> of<00:02:57.180> figure<00:02:57.480> unit<00:02:57.960> size<00:02:58.170> or

much any scale of figure unit size or
