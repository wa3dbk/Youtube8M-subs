00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.110 
shape nicely okay please see what it
sounds<00:02:28.440> like<00:02:28.500> without<00:02:29.070> those<00:02:29.340> battles<00:02:29.820> in<00:02:29.940> and

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
sounds like without those battles in and

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.150 
sounds like without those battles in and
the<00:02:30.630> new<00:02:30.810> head<00:02:31.050> or<00:02:31.200> replace<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.740> whole<00:02:31.950> head

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
the new head or replace the whole head

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.820 
the new head or replace the whole head
on<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.400> right-hand<00:02:32.790> side<00:02:32.880> as<00:02:33.300> I<00:02:34.230> replace<00:02:34.620> the

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
on the right-hand side as I replace the

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.680 
on the right-hand side as I replace the
head<00:02:34.980> gaskets<00:02:35.430> on<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.670> last<00:02:35.850> update<00:02:36.240> but<00:02:36.600> the

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
head gaskets on the last update but the

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.990 
head gaskets on the last update but the
head<00:02:36.870> makes<00:02:37.680> a<00:02:37.770> lot<00:02:37.890> of<00:02:37.920> difference<00:02:38.340> I<00:02:38.610> think

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
head makes a lot of difference I think

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.850 
head makes a lot of difference I think
the<00:02:39.090> valve<00:02:39.300> seats<00:02:39.600> were<00:02:39.720> broken<00:02:39.990> or<00:02:40.800> worn

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
the valve seats were broken or worn

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:48.980 
the valve seats were broken or worn
because<00:02:41.700> there<00:02:41.940> was<00:02:42.030> excessive<00:02:42.600> smoke<00:02:47.990> you

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
because there was excessive smoke you

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.740 
because there was excessive smoke you
can<00:02:49.110> see<00:02:49.320> a<00:02:49.700> little<00:02:50.700> bit<00:02:50.880> of<00:02:50.940> smoke<00:02:51.270> probably

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
can see a little bit of smoke probably

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.340 
can see a little bit of smoke probably
from<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:51.990> oil<00:02:52.020> in<00:02:52.320> the<00:02:52.350> exhaust<00:02:52.740> but<00:02:54.350> just

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
from the oil in the exhaust but just

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.390 
from the oil in the exhaust but just
chugging<00:02:55.740> away<00:02:55.860> nicely<00:02:56.220> now<00:03:00.020> there<00:03:01.020> we<00:03:01.140> go
