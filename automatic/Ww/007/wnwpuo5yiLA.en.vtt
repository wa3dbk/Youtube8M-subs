 knows that gta is the game that is and always is 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.490
 It was and always will be the game to have given me 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.949
 by the tutelary council for the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.539

 controversial game is even forbidden in some 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.960

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.570

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.180
 put to play gta analyze 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.059
 what would be their reactions 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.489
 I think it's going to be the reaction of 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.930
 An old man playing gta thinks he 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.879
 terrible thing do not want to judge you 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.640
 think they will have fun in a month 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.480
 in reaction the then I already have this face that 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.789
 looks good bearded father noel they 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.739
 They took a lot of old people that are very 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.079
 humorous truth you see only 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:02.640
 the well line tops 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.409
 hence at first they give a thousand places 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.420
 ness controls and see that they can 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.150
 hit the wall with the car can is 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.189
 right but after a while they 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.930
 start to have fun, man has a 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.680
 special that will study the past for 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.650
 in front of this Japanese that he elects 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.080
 he has a lot of fun 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.009
 he takes first that he is not 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.530
 red right 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.150
 nobody says the prerequisite is the game 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.119
 offender then he to the red sign 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.860
 will go quiet until without him 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.979
 starts trampling people and beating speech 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.530
 Pulls life, how can this be fun? 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.710
 There's another old man here who speaks like that. 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.369
 Wow, he picks up an eta knife in town. 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.509
 and ufac the woman woman dies he talks 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.799
 so ours 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.380
 It's only for the first time in my life. 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.229
 Life I 'm having a good time in the south. 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.000
 but then this guy is what more 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.950
 Amused if he gets some cars talking 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.579
 Who is the case now I do not know that everything in 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.439
 English but you can identify 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:04.170
 these reactions and see that they really 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.340
 having fun so once again is 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.739
 that is our question that games 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.179
 makes people violent and game 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.640
 can evaluate if you can do what you want 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:16.030
 and it goes very well with you to separate this 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.860
 virtual life question real life but 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.650
 I found the old people very interesting if 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:25.170
 entertaining with the game as gta and 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.170
 managing to separate these things gala 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.090
 the team
