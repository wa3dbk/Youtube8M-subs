made you so successful let's begin with

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.880 
made you so successful let's begin with
the<00:00:17.029> grip<00:00:17.359> because<00:00:17.810> you've<00:00:17.960> got<00:00:18.109> a<00:00:18.140> lúcia<00:00:18.500> grip

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
the grip because you've got a lúcia grip

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.320 
the grip because you've got a lúcia grip
than<00:00:19.100> a<00:00:19.130> lot<00:00:19.340> of<00:00:19.430> youngsters<00:00:19.610> do<00:00:19.940> I<00:00:19.970> think<00:00:20.120> one

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
than a lot of youngsters do I think one

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.760 
than a lot of youngsters do I think one
of<00:00:20.360> the<00:00:20.450> most<00:00:20.570> important<00:00:21.140> things<00:00:21.289> is<00:00:21.440> the<00:00:21.470> grip

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.770 
of the most important things is the grip

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.170 
of the most important things is the grip
is<00:00:21.920> you<00:00:21.950> have<00:00:22.160> to<00:00:22.280> feel<00:00:22.460> comfortable<00:00:22.520> with

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
is you have to feel comfortable with

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.609 
is you have to feel comfortable with
your<00:00:23.300> grip<00:00:23.510> but<00:00:23.990> as<00:00:24.080> long<00:00:24.230> as<00:00:24.320> you're<00:00:24.410> doing

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
your grip but as long as you're doing

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:26.080 
your grip but as long as you're doing
the<00:00:24.710> basics<00:00:25.100> right<00:00:25.340> you<00:00:25.520> haven't<00:00:25.730> got<00:00:25.970> the

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
the basics right you haven't got the

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.900 
the basics right you haven't got the
ball<00:00:26.270> too<00:00:26.990> far<00:00:27.020> in<00:00:27.500> your<00:00:27.590> palm<00:00:27.860> like<00:00:28.130> that<00:00:28.369> but

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
ball too far in your palm like that but

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.279 
ball too far in your palm like that but
you<00:00:29.000> know<00:00:29.150> if<00:00:29.330> you<00:00:29.420> haven't<00:00:29.660> got<00:00:29.750> it<00:00:29.840> too<00:00:30.020> close

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
you know if you haven't got it too close

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:32.529 
you know if you haven't got it too close
and<00:00:30.560> too<00:00:30.590> far<00:00:31.250> in<00:00:31.400> there<00:00:31.550> it's<00:00:31.699> just<00:00:31.970> about

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:32.539 
and too far in there it's just about

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:34.180 
and too far in there it's just about
hard<00:00:32.780> to<00:00:32.930> get<00:00:33.050> the<00:00:33.140> ball<00:00:33.320> to<00:00:33.379> actually<00:00:33.859> spin

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
hard to get the ball to actually spin

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.620 
hard to get the ball to actually spin
the<00:00:34.309> ball<00:00:34.489> you<00:00:34.640> need<00:00:34.850> to<00:00:34.910> have<00:00:35.000> a<00:00:35.030> bit<00:00:35.210> of<00:00:35.239> a<00:00:35.390> gap

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630 
the ball you need to have a bit of a gap

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.780 
the ball you need to have a bit of a gap
in<00:00:36.170> between<00:00:36.230> there<00:00:36.980> so<00:00:37.280> you<00:00:37.340> can<00:00:37.460> actually<00:00:37.579> get

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
in between there so you can actually get

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.000 
in between there so you can actually get
the<00:00:37.910> leverage<00:00:38.120> to<00:00:39.050> actually<00:00:39.380> spin<00:00:39.649> the<00:00:39.800> ball

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
the leverage to actually spin the ball

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.160 
the leverage to actually spin the ball
so<00:00:40.579> that's<00:00:40.670> important<00:00:41.270> grip<00:00:41.540> is<00:00:41.720> something

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
so that's important grip is something

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.870 
so that's important grip is something
the<00:00:42.680> actual<00:00:42.980> pressure<00:00:43.220> of<00:00:43.460> your<00:00:43.610> grip<00:00:43.790> is

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:43.880 
the actual pressure of your grip is

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.400 
the actual pressure of your grip is
something<00:00:44.329> that<00:00:44.480> you<00:00:45.020> have<00:00:45.050> to<00:00:45.260> feel

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
something that you have to feel

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.900 
something that you have to feel
comfortable<00:00:45.950> with<00:00:46.070> what<00:00:46.100> I<00:00:46.340> do

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
comfortable with what I do

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.610 
comfortable with what I do
which<00:00:47.360> not<00:00:47.600> necessarily<00:00:48.140> mean<00:00:48.290> it's<00:00:48.440> right

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
which not necessarily mean it's right

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.560 
which not necessarily mean it's right
but<00:00:48.800> it<00:00:48.920> just<00:00:48.950> suits<00:00:49.340> me<00:00:49.460> that's<00:00:49.790> one<00:00:50.000> very

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
but it just suits me that's one very

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.150 
but it just suits me that's one very
important<00:00:51.020> point<00:00:51.200> you<00:00:51.380> must<00:00:51.620> do<00:00:51.829> what<00:00:51.950> suits

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
important point you must do what suits

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.889 
important point you must do what suits
yourself<00:00:52.610> but<00:00:53.300> as<00:00:53.390> long<00:00:53.510> as<00:00:53.630> you<00:00:53.690> doing<00:00:53.840> the

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
yourself but as long as you doing the

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.200 
yourself but as long as you doing the
basics<00:00:54.290> right<00:00:54.440> my<00:00:55.040> grip<00:00:55.340> a<00:00:55.520> lot<00:00:55.700> of<00:00:55.820> people<00:00:56.090> are

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
basics right my grip a lot of people are

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.990 
basics right my grip a lot of people are
taught<00:00:56.450> to<00:00:57.050> grip<00:00:57.260> it<00:00:57.379> really<00:00:57.680> tight<00:00:57.980> and<00:00:58.219> and

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
taught to grip it really tight and and

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.700 
taught to grip it really tight and and
really<00:00:59.360> squeeze<00:00:59.750> it<00:00:59.899> and<00:01:00.200> spread<00:01:00.500> these

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
really squeeze it and spread these

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:01.600 
really squeeze it and spread these
fingers<00:01:01.160> like<00:01:01.340> that

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
fingers like that

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.359 
fingers like that
the<00:01:02.480> reason<00:01:02.840> I<00:01:02.960> don't<00:01:03.020> like<00:01:03.379> that<00:01:03.620> first<00:01:04.219> of

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
the reason I don't like that first of

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.300 
the reason I don't like that first of
all<00:01:04.489> is<00:01:04.640> if<00:01:04.850> you've<00:01:04.969> got<00:01:05.000> a<00:01:05.149> tight<00:01:05.600> and<00:01:05.869> tense

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
all is if you've got a tight and tense

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.469 
all is if you've got a tight and tense
you're<00:01:07.310> tense<00:01:07.549> when<00:01:07.729> you<00:01:07.820> come<00:01:08.000> to<00:01:08.119> the<00:01:08.210> wicket

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
you're tense when you come to the wicket

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.000 
you're tense when you come to the wicket
you're<00:01:08.960> actually<00:01:09.260> coming<00:01:09.500> up<00:01:09.650> and<00:01:09.799> you've<00:01:09.890> got

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
you're actually coming up and you've got

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.859 
you're actually coming up and you've got
it<00:01:10.100> tight<00:01:10.369> and<00:01:10.729> it's<00:01:10.940> all<00:01:11.180> getting<00:01:11.510> really

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
it tight and it's all getting really

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.380 
it tight and it's all getting really
hard<00:01:12.110> I<00:01:12.380> like<00:01:12.890> to<00:01:12.979> feel<00:01:13.190> relaxed<00:01:13.729> I<00:01:13.880> think<00:01:14.210> if<00:01:14.299> I

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
hard I like to feel relaxed I think if I

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.780 
hard I like to feel relaxed I think if I
feel<00:01:14.630> relaxed<00:01:15.080> doing<00:01:15.320> it<00:01:15.470> then<00:01:15.950> I<00:01:16.040> be<00:01:16.430> able<00:01:16.670> to

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
feel relaxed doing it then I be able to

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.609 
feel relaxed doing it then I be able to
do<00:01:16.909> what<00:01:17.030> I<00:01:17.090> want<00:01:17.299> to<00:01:17.390> do<00:01:17.479> down<00:01:17.630> that<00:01:17.840> end<00:01:18.020> so

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
do what I want to do down that end so

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.260 
do what I want to do down that end so
the<00:01:18.770> reason<00:01:19.100> being<00:01:19.310> I<00:01:19.490> have<00:01:19.670> a<00:01:19.700> nice<00:01:19.909> loose

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
the reason being I have a nice loose

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.510 
the reason being I have a nice loose
grip<00:01:20.600> my<00:01:21.200> fingers<00:01:21.650> are<00:01:21.920> probably<00:01:22.280> a<00:01:22.340> bit<00:01:22.369> too

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
grip my fingers are probably a bit too

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.310 
grip my fingers are probably a bit too
close<00:01:22.850> together<00:01:23.180> but<00:01:23.330> that<00:01:23.479> works<00:01:23.689> for<00:01:23.990> me<00:01:24.140> and

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
close together but that works for me and

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.590 
close together but that works for me and
they're<00:01:24.979> very<00:01:25.130> loose<00:01:25.460> it's<00:01:25.790> two<00:01:26.030> fingers<00:01:26.390> down

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
they're very loose it's two fingers down

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.960 
they're very loose it's two fingers down
two<00:01:27.350> fingers<00:01:27.710> up<00:01:27.890> and<00:01:28.070> the<00:01:28.340> board<00:01:28.549> has<00:01:28.700> slots

two fingers up and the board has slots

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.399 
two fingers up and the board has slots
in<00:01:29.119> there<00:01:29.210> like<00:01:29.390> that<00:01:29.570> and<00:01:29.750> the<00:01:30.170> thumb

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
in there like that and the thumb

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.620 
in there like that and the thumb
distressed<00:01:30.860> there<00:01:31.130> a<00:01:31.369> lot<00:01:32.119> of<00:01:32.150> people<00:01:32.299> talk

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
distressed there a lot of people talk

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.539 
distressed there a lot of people talk
about<00:01:32.750> how<00:01:33.080> high<00:01:33.320> your<00:01:33.619> arm<00:01:33.770> should<00:01:34.130> be<00:01:34.189> we've

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
about how high your arm should be we've

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:36.340 
about how high your arm should be we've
heard<00:01:34.729> people<00:01:34.759> say<00:01:35.180> you<00:01:35.210> shouldn't<00:01:35.570> be<00:01:35.750> above

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
heard people say you shouldn't be above

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.080 
heard people say you shouldn't be above
the<00:01:36.500> perpendicular<00:01:37.250> and<00:01:37.460> you<00:01:37.729> shouldn't<00:01:38.000> be

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
the perpendicular and you shouldn't be

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.390 
the perpendicular and you shouldn't be
too<00:01:38.270> low<00:01:38.630> when<00:01:38.900> you<00:01:39.020> release<00:01:39.259> the<00:01:39.439> ball<00:01:39.560> yeah<00:01:40.369> I

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
too low when you release the ball yeah I

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.730 
too low when you release the ball yeah I
think<00:01:41.299> some<00:01:41.689> way<00:01:41.810> that<00:01:41.990> you've<00:01:42.110> got<00:01:42.320> too<00:01:42.530> high

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
think some way that you've got too high

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.060 
think some way that you've got too high
and<00:01:43.070> you've<00:01:43.850> got<00:01:44.000> too<00:01:44.210> low<00:01:44.420> I<00:01:44.750> think<00:01:45.500> somewhere

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
and you've got too low I think somewhere

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.130 
and you've got too low I think somewhere
in<00:01:46.220> between<00:01:46.340> there<00:01:46.939> is<00:01:47.150> about<00:01:47.600> where<00:01:47.810> mine

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
in between there is about where mine

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.530 
in between there is about where mine
sometimes<00:01:48.799> gets<00:01:49.009> a<00:01:49.100> little<00:01:49.250> bit<00:01:49.430> too<00:01:49.670> low<00:01:49.880> but

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
sometimes gets a little bit too low but

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.749 
sometimes gets a little bit too low but
most<00:01:51.320> of<00:01:51.439> the<00:01:51.530> time<00:01:51.770> it's<00:01:51.950> around<00:01:52.220> that<00:01:52.460> sort

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
most of the time it's around that sort

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.039 
most of the time it's around that sort
of<00:01:52.880> area<00:01:53.270> I'm<00:01:53.329> not<00:01:53.360> sure<00:01:53.659> what<00:01:53.810> sort<00:01:53.960> of

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
of area I'm not sure what sort of

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.590 
of area I'm not sure what sort of
degrees<00:01:54.380> that<00:01:54.650> is<00:01:54.860> but<00:01:55.520> that<00:01:55.700> I<00:01:55.850> think<00:01:56.150> enables

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
degrees that is but that I think enables

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.539 
degrees that is but that I think enables
me<00:01:56.750> to<00:01:56.780> get<00:01:56.990> maximum<00:01:57.380> spin<00:01:57.920> from<00:01:58.400> my

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
me to get maximum spin from my

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.480 
me to get maximum spin from my
deliveries<00:01:59.090> and<00:01:59.270> also<00:01:59.570> my<00:01:59.750> variations

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
deliveries and also my variations

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.530 
deliveries and also my variations
generally<00:02:01.490> my<00:02:01.640> role<00:02:01.850> in<00:02:02.000> my<00:02:02.119> arm<00:02:02.299> will<00:02:02.420> be<00:02:02.450> a

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
generally my role in my arm will be a

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.270 
generally my role in my arm will be a
little<00:02:02.750> bit<00:02:02.930> higher<00:02:03.110> but<00:02:03.590> generally<00:02:03.950> my<00:02:04.070> leg

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
little bit higher but generally my leg

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.069 
little bit higher but generally my leg
break<00:02:04.549> will<00:02:04.790> be<00:02:04.820> work<00:02:05.180> at<00:02:05.329> about<00:02:05.540> that<00:02:05.720> sort<00:02:06.020> of

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
break will be work at about that sort of

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.279 
break will be work at about that sort of
angle<00:02:07.090> so<00:02:08.090> I've<00:02:08.239> got<00:02:08.420> my<00:02:08.509> run-up<00:02:08.840> I'm<00:02:08.989> here<00:02:09.170> on

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
angle so I've got my run-up I'm here on

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.500 
angle so I've got my run-up I'm here on
I<00:02:09.470> know<00:02:09.590> exactly<00:02:10.039> what<00:02:10.250> I'm<00:02:10.310> going<00:02:10.489> to<00:02:10.640> do<00:02:10.789> now

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
I know exactly what I'm going to do now

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.539 
I know exactly what I'm going to do now
I<00:02:11.540> start<00:02:11.959> to<00:02:11.989> build<00:02:12.200> it<00:02:12.349> up<00:02:12.439> as<00:02:12.680> I<00:02:13.099> get<00:02:13.249> closer

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:13.549 
I start to build it up as I get closer

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:15.429 
I start to build it up as I get closer
to<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.939> wicket<00:02:14.239> here<00:02:14.419> I<00:02:14.629> start<00:02:15.019> to<00:02:15.109> build<00:02:15.319> it

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:15.439 
to the wicket here I start to build it

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:16.330 
to the wicket here I start to build it
up<00:02:15.529> and<00:02:15.739> then

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
up and then

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.360 
up and then
ball<00:02:18.640> pretty<00:02:19.640> good<00:02:19.760> cherry<00:02:20.060> just<00:02:20.180> volley<00:02:20.420> to

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
ball pretty good cherry just volley to

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.100 
ball pretty good cherry just volley to
and<00:02:22.370> when<00:02:22.580> and<00:02:22.760> and<00:02:23.480> when<00:02:23.629> you<00:02:23.750> reach<00:02:23.930> the

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
and when and and when you reach the

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.110 
and when and and when you reach the
crease<00:02:24.260> you<00:02:24.410> talk<00:02:24.620> about<00:02:24.739> this<00:02:24.950> explosion<00:02:25.790> of

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
crease you talk about this explosion of

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.970 
crease you talk about this explosion of
the<00:02:26.239> crease<00:02:26.450> this<00:02:26.599> is<00:02:26.750> the<00:02:26.870> energy<00:02:27.050> at<00:02:27.739> the

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
the crease this is the energy at the

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.009 
the crease this is the energy at the
crease<00:02:28.220> isn't<00:02:28.670> it<00:02:28.730> and<00:02:28.940> where<00:02:29.569> do<00:02:29.660> you<00:02:29.690> propel

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
crease isn't it and where do you propel

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.140 
crease isn't it and where do you propel
it<00:02:30.110> towards<00:02:30.349> the<00:02:30.410> batsman<00:02:30.800> well<00:02:31.730> I'm<00:02:31.910> a<00:02:32.000> little

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
it towards the batsman well I'm a little

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.729 
it towards the batsman well I'm a little
bit<00:02:32.330> different<00:02:32.510> a<00:02:32.780> lot<00:02:32.900> of<00:02:33.019> people<00:02:33.319> I<00:02:33.500> know<00:02:33.560> and

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
bit different a lot of people I know and

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.050 
bit different a lot of people I know and
be<00:02:33.890> different<00:02:34.220> in<00:02:34.280> some<00:02:34.430> things<00:02:34.640> but<00:02:34.700> a<00:02:34.790> lot<00:02:34.970> of

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
be different in some things but a lot of

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.250 
be different in some things but a lot of
people<00:02:35.360> what<00:02:35.480> they<00:02:35.599> do<00:02:35.660> they're<00:02:36.080> anywhere

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
people what they do they're anywhere

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.990 
people what they do they're anywhere
there<00:02:36.500> is<00:02:36.530> max<00:02:36.830> mark<00:02:37.099> but<00:02:37.670> what<00:02:37.790> a<00:02:37.819> lot<00:02:37.940> of

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
there is max mark but what a lot of

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.059 
there is max mark but what a lot of
people<00:02:38.180> think<00:02:38.569> about<00:02:38.629> is<00:02:39.410> they<00:02:39.650> think<00:02:39.709> about<00:02:39.950> a

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
people think about is they think about a

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:41.740 
people think about is they think about a
spot<00:02:40.430> on<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:40.670> wicket<00:02:40.970> they<00:02:41.360> think<00:02:41.629> about

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
spot on the wicket they think about

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.150 
spot on the wicket they think about
certain<00:02:42.260> different<00:02:42.620> things<00:02:42.830> I<00:02:43.010> actually

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
certain different things I actually

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.369 
certain different things I actually
think<00:02:43.519> about<00:02:43.640> what<00:02:44.000> shot<00:02:44.629> I<00:02:44.750> want<00:02:44.959> the<00:02:45.019> batsman

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:45.379 
think about what shot I want the batsman

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:47.320 
think about what shot I want the batsman
to<00:02:45.410> play<00:02:45.680> without<00:02:46.549> wanting<00:02:46.819> to<00:02:46.970> have<00:02:47.120> pushing

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
to play without wanting to have pushing

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.569 
to play without wanting to have pushing
back<00:02:47.599> and<00:02:47.810> defend<00:02:48.080> what<00:02:48.890> I<00:02:48.920> want<00:02:49.099> to<00:02:49.190> draw<00:02:49.430> him

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
back and defend what I want to draw him

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:51.520 
back and defend what I want to draw him
forward<00:02:49.940> to<00:02:50.060> drive<00:02:50.390> what<00:02:50.930> I<00:02:50.989> wanting<00:02:51.230> to<00:02:51.319> try

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
forward to drive what I wanting to try

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.470 
forward to drive what I wanting to try
and<00:02:51.650> sweep<00:02:51.980> well<00:02:52.730> I'm<00:02:52.819> trying<00:02:53.090> to<00:02:53.120> push<00:02:53.299> him

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
and sweep well I'm trying to push him

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.900 
and sweep well I'm trying to push him
back<00:02:53.690> on<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:53.900> back<00:02:54.110> foot<00:02:54.410> so<00:02:55.130> that<00:02:55.160> allows<00:02:55.549> me

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
back on the back foot so that allows me

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.699 
back on the back foot so that allows me
to<00:02:56.150> ball<00:02:56.390> exactly<00:02:56.840> where<00:02:56.959> I<00:02:56.989> want<00:02:57.260> rather<00:02:57.530> than

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
to ball exactly where I want rather than

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.530 
to ball exactly where I want rather than
focusing<00:02:58.220> in<00:02:58.370> on<00:02:58.430> a<00:02:58.489> spot<00:02:58.880> or<00:02:59.090> anything<00:02:59.209> like

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
focusing in on a spot or anything like

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.300 
focusing in on a spot or anything like
that<00:02:59.599> I<00:02:59.930> think<00:03:00.440> about<00:03:00.590> what<00:03:00.739> I'm<00:03:00.799> trying<00:03:01.129> to

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
that I think about what I'm trying to

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.309 
that I think about what I'm trying to
get<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.549> bats<00:03:01.730> now<00:03:01.940> I've<00:03:02.120> got<00:03:02.269> my<00:03:02.390> plan<00:03:02.720> I'm

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319

get the bats now I've got my plan I'm
trying<00:03:03.650> to<00:03:03.709> work<00:03:03.860> that<00:03:04.160> plan<00:03:04.340> to<00:03:04.489> get<00:03:04.640> them<00:03:04.790> out

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
trying to work that plan to get them out

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.880 
trying to work that plan to get them out
so<00:03:05.569> then<00:03:05.690> it's<00:03:05.840> a<00:03:05.900> matter<00:03:06.049> of<00:03:06.140> execution<00:03:06.620> you

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
so then it's a matter of execution you

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.410 
so then it's a matter of execution you
have<00:03:07.040> to<00:03:07.129> execute<00:03:07.459> what<00:03:07.790> you're<00:03:07.910> trying<00:03:08.150> to<00:03:08.269> do

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
two things I get sometimes I do get a

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.199 
two things I get sometimes I do get a
bit<00:03:17.420> too<00:03:17.599> round<00:03:17.840> um<00:03:18.049> so<00:03:18.440> my<00:03:18.620> keywords<00:03:19.190> think<00:03:20.030> I

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
bit too round um so my keywords think I

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.930 
bit too round um so my keywords think I
and<00:03:20.540> spin<00:03:21.139> up<00:03:21.170> which<00:03:21.980> means<00:03:22.160> with<00:03:22.519> my<00:03:22.700> arms

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
and spin up which means with my arms

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.670 
and spin up which means with my arms
there<00:03:23.120> and<00:03:23.269> I<00:03:23.299> think<00:03:23.359> hi<00:03:23.750> it<00:03:24.049> just<00:03:24.319> gets<00:03:24.440> it<00:03:24.590> up

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
there and I think hi it just gets it up

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.930 
there and I think hi it just gets it up
to<00:03:24.799> about<00:03:24.859> there<00:03:25.160> it<00:03:25.280> doesn't<00:03:25.549> mean<00:03:25.670> it's<00:03:25.819> up

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
to about there it doesn't mean it's up

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.059 
to about there it doesn't mean it's up
there<00:03:26.120> so<00:03:26.900> I<00:03:26.930> think<00:03:27.079> hi<00:03:27.380> to<00:03:27.440> get<00:03:27.620> my<00:03:27.709> arm<00:03:27.859> up

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
there so I think hi to get my arm up

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.789 
there so I think hi to get my arm up
into<00:03:28.910> that<00:03:29.030> position<00:03:29.209> and<00:03:29.660> spin<00:03:30.049> up<00:03:30.170> is<00:03:30.410> not

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
into that position and spin up is not

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:32.140 
into that position and spin up is not
just<00:03:30.980> make<00:03:31.160> sure<00:03:31.310> you<00:03:31.400> spin<00:03:31.670> down<00:03:31.819> but<00:03:32.060> it's

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
just make sure you spin down but it's

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.180 
just make sure you spin down but it's
actually<00:03:32.420> to<00:03:32.510> spin<00:03:32.750> the<00:03:32.840> ball<00:03:32.989> up<00:03:33.200> and<00:03:33.410> here<00:03:34.040> in

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
actually to spin the ball up and here in

you're not going to beat people off the
pitch<00:03:46.340> too<00:03:46.549> much<00:03:46.730> you<00:03:46.970> have<00:03:47.150> to<00:03:47.180> get<00:03:47.450> them<00:03:47.569> in

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
pitch too much you have to get them in

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.580 
pitch too much you have to get them in
the<00:03:47.750> air<00:03:47.870> you<00:03:47.989> have<00:03:48.049> to<00:03:48.169> get<00:03:48.349> them<00:03:48.470> to

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
second-guess what's going on and you do

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:52.059 
second-guess what's going on and you do
that<00:03:50.750> in<00:03:50.870> flight<00:03:51.169> try<00:03:51.590> to<00:03:51.650> give<00:03:51.799> us<00:03:51.889> this

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
that in flight try to give us this

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:54.909 
that in flight try to give us this
feeling<00:03:52.250> then<00:03:52.609> of<00:03:53.470> standing<00:03:54.470> tall<00:03:54.709> and

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:54.919 
feeling then of standing tall and

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:57.759 
feeling then of standing tall and
spinning<00:03:55.760> up<00:03:55.880> well<00:03:56.630> the<00:03:56.900> easiest<00:03:57.380> thing<00:03:57.620> is<00:03:57.739> to

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
spinning up well the easiest thing is to

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:58.750 
spinning up well the easiest thing is to
do<00:03:57.950> there's<00:03:58.160> a<00:03:58.220> difference<00:03:58.549> when<00:03:58.730> you

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
do there's a difference when you

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.729 
do there's a difference when you
actually<00:03:58.970> bowl<00:03:59.359> it's<00:04:00.019> all<00:04:00.200> about<00:04:00.410> when<00:04:00.620> you

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
actually bowl it's all about when you

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.099 
actually bowl it's all about when you
release<00:04:01.040> the<00:04:01.220> ball<00:04:01.370> -<00:04:01.690> sometimes<00:04:02.690> if<00:04:02.870> you<00:04:02.959> try

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
release the ball - sometimes if you try

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:04.300 
release the ball - sometimes if you try
and<00:04:03.230> do<00:04:03.410> it<00:04:03.530> and<00:04:03.650> you're<00:04:03.739> actually<00:04:03.859> trying<00:04:04.250> to

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
and do it and you're actually trying to

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.490 
and do it and you're actually trying to
spin<00:04:04.579> the<00:04:04.669> ball<00:04:04.819> hard<00:04:05.120> you<00:04:05.780> generally<00:04:06.200> get<00:04:06.319> to

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
spin the ball hard you generally get to

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.870 
spin the ball hard you generally get to
about<00:04:06.650> into<00:04:06.980> this<00:04:07.099> position<00:04:07.340> then<00:04:07.609> you<00:04:07.700> try

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
about into this position then you try

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.879 
about into this position then you try
and<00:04:07.910> spin<00:04:08.239> it<00:04:08.389> hard<00:04:08.540> and<00:04:08.870> what<00:04:09.380> happens<00:04:09.680> is<00:04:09.769> you

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:09.889 
and spin it hard and what happens is you

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:12.430 
and spin it hard and what happens is you
drag<00:04:10.130> it<00:04:10.340> down<00:04:10.549> so<00:04:11.359> if<00:04:11.840> you're<00:04:11.959> trying<00:04:12.109> to<00:04:12.230> spin

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
drag it down so if you're trying to spin

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.990 
drag it down so if you're trying to spin
it<00:04:12.530> hard<00:04:12.650> sometimes<00:04:12.980> you<00:04:13.250> open<00:04:13.430> up<00:04:13.669> like<00:04:13.760> that

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
it hard sometimes you open up like that

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.029 
it hard sometimes you open up like that
and<00:04:14.120> you<00:04:14.239> drag<00:04:14.569> it<00:04:14.750> down<00:04:14.930> spinning<00:04:15.440> so<00:04:15.950> you

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.039 
and you drag it down spinning so you
