considering organic production is that a
lot<00:03:24.930> of<00:03:25.080> the<00:03:25.170> practices<00:03:25.620> we<00:03:25.950> have<00:03:26.209> between<00:03:27.209> the

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
here on the farm were practices that

here on the farm were practices that
were<00:03:32.580> very<00:03:32.730> similar<00:03:33.239> very<00:03:33.660> close<00:03:33.930> to<00:03:34.170> organic

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
were very similar very close to organic

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.979 
were very similar very close to organic
