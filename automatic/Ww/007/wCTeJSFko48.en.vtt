00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
it's a four-way rail junction which is

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.660 
it's a four-way rail junction which is
something<00:00:25.350> that<00:00:25.500> used<00:00:25.800> quite<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.250> lot<00:00:28.670> when

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
something that used quite a lot when

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:36.799 
something that used quite a lot when
building<00:00:35.239> sections<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.420> go<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.570> different

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
building sections to go to different

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.990 
building sections to go to different
parts<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.380> map<00:00:37.610> so<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.640> only<00:00:38.790> need<00:00:38.850> a

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
parts of the map so you only need a

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:48.470 
parts of the map so you only need a
block<00:00:39.300> 5<00:00:39.629> well<00:00:40.469> 5v5<00:00:40.950> block<00:00:47.300> build<00:00:48.300> this<00:00:48.420> little

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
block 5 well 5v5 block build this little

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.840 
block 5 well 5v5 block build this little
pillow<00:00:49.410> section<00:00:49.890> in<00:00:50.010> each<00:00:50.489> one<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.820> these<00:00:50.969> I

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
pillow section in each one of these I

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.770 
pillow section in each one of these I
knew<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:54.059> was<00:00:54.239> going<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.420> need<00:00:54.600> one<00:00:54.750> of

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
knew that I was going to need one of

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.330 
knew that I was going to need one of
them<00:00:54.899> at<00:00:55.020> some<00:00:55.199> point<00:00:55.500> just<00:00:55.680> fill<00:00:56.039> out<00:00:56.070> for<00:00:56.489> now

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
them at some point just fill out for now

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:05.649 
them at some point just fill out for now
so<00:00:59.340> drop<00:00:59.550> them<00:00:59.730> out<00:00:59.930> and<00:01:01.460> then<00:01:02.460> on<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.180> corners

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
so drop them out and then on the corners

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.820 
so drop them out and then on the corners
drop<00:01:06.659> these<00:01:06.840> around<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.380> as<00:01:07.500> well<00:01:09.560> so<00:01:10.560> this<00:01:10.799> is

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
drop these around it as well so this is

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.899 
drop these around it as well so this is
what<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.460> should<00:01:11.520> be<00:01:11.820> looking<00:01:12.180> like<00:01:16.729> as<00:01:17.729> you

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
what it should be looking like as you

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:26.160 
what it should be looking like as you
build<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.270> all

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.170 

so<00:01:27.170> that's<00:01:27.500> pretty<00:01:27.710> much<00:01:27.890> the<00:01:27.950> armor<00:01:28.610> still<00:01:29.060> at

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
so that's pretty much the armor still at

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.710 
so that's pretty much the armor still at
least<00:01:29.210> sad<00:01:29.510> it's<00:01:29.690> pretty<00:01:29.930> much<00:01:30.080> the<00:01:31.570> basics<00:01:32.570> of

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
least sad it's pretty much the basics of

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:41.870 
least sad it's pretty much the basics of
what<00:01:32.900> you<00:01:33.320> want<00:01:33.440> it<00:01:33.650> to<00:01:33.770> be<00:01:33.800> covered<00:01:34.100> with

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:51.209 

each<00:01:42.880> one<00:01:43.119> of<00:01:43.149> these<00:01:43.299> are<00:01:43.600> Bible<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:50.140> if<00:01:50.439> you

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:51.219 
each one of these are Bible so if you

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:52.499 
each one of these are Bible so if you
know<00:01:51.340> there's<00:01:51.520> a<00:01:51.579> lot<00:01:51.729> of<00:01:51.759> people<00:01:52.030> it<00:01:52.119> did<00:01:52.270> use

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
know there's a lot of people it did use

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.039 
know there's a lot of people it did use
it<00:01:53.039> no<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:55.149> it's<00:01:55.329> one<00:01:55.509> you<00:01:55.659> know<00:01:55.780> I've<00:01:55.929> not

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 
it no and it's one you know I've not

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:57.480 
it no and it's one you know I've not
come<00:01:56.200> up<00:01:56.319> with<00:01:56.350> this<00:01:56.560> by<00:01:56.770> any<00:01:56.920> means<00:01:57.100> up<00:01:57.310> what

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
come up with this by any means up what

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.609 
come up with this by any means up what
I've<00:01:57.609> done<00:01:57.789> this<00:01:57.849> by<00:01:58.149> watching<00:01:58.530> hundreds<00:01:59.530> of

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
I've done this by watching hundreds of

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.139 
I've done this by watching hundreds of
tutorials<00:02:00.280> I<00:02:00.369> just<00:02:00.549> seem<00:02:00.700> something<00:02:00.939> that

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
tutorials I just seem something that

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:02.760 
tutorials I just seem something that
this<00:02:01.270> is<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:01.689> one<00:02:01.990> of<00:02:02.079> the<00:02:02.140> best<00:02:02.319> settles<00:02:02.649> for

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
this is the one of the best settles for

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.550 
this is the one of the best settles for
a<00:02:02.950> for<00:02:03.490> direction<00:02:04.000> one<00:02:04.319> so<00:02:05.319> all<00:02:05.409> these

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
a for direction one so all these

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.819 
a for direction one so all these
switches<00:02:05.859> all<00:02:06.490> go<00:02:07.090> on<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:10.690> each<00:02:11.319> side<00:02:11.560> of<00:02:11.739> that

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:11.829 
switches all go on to each side of that

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:25.650 
switches all go on to each side of that
pillar<00:02:15.090> double<00:02:16.090> upon<00:02:16.329> these<00:02:17.280> in<00:02:18.280> each<00:02:18.459> one<00:02:24.660> all

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
pillar double upon these in each one all

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.110 
pillar double upon these in each one all
right<00:02:25.930> what<00:02:26.379> we<00:02:26.530> need<00:02:26.799> to<00:02:26.920> do<00:02:27.099> is<00:02:27.430> take<00:02:27.670> out<00:02:27.940> the

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
right what we need to do is take out the

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.190 
right what we need to do is take out the
bottom<00:02:28.480> block<00:02:29.129> of<00:02:30.129> each<00:02:30.370> one<00:02:30.609> of<00:02:30.640> these<00:02:31.200> the

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
bottom block of each one of these the

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.869 
bottom block of each one of these the
other<00:02:32.379> thing<00:02:32.560> as<00:02:32.709> well<00:02:32.739> is<00:02:33.160> that<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.700> one<00:02:33.849> I

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
other thing as well is that the one I

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.569 
other thing as well is that the one I
made<00:02:34.090> this<00:02:34.299> this<00:02:34.510> was<00:02:34.690> originally<00:02:35.579> before

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
made this this was originally before

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:39.930 
made this this was originally before
creative<00:02:37.209> mode<00:02:37.420> even<00:02:37.569> appeared<00:02:38.549> so<00:02:39.549> it<00:02:39.640> wasn't

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
creative mode even appeared so it wasn't

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.509 
creative mode even appeared so it wasn't
anything<00:02:40.239> that<00:02:40.420> we<00:02:40.720> could<00:02:41.190> we<00:02:42.190> could<00:02:42.340> really

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
anything that we could we could really

00:02:42.519 --> 00:03:01.420 
anything that we could we could really
do<00:02:42.760> a<00:02:42.790> lot<00:02:42.880> with

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430

each<00:03:13.560> one<00:03:13.859> of<00:03:13.890> these<00:03:17.359> there's<00:03:18.359> a<00:03:18.420> little<00:03:18.540> check

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
each one of these there's a little check

what<00:03:23.819> you<00:03:23.909> need<00:03:24.000> next<00:03:24.209> is<00:03:24.359> powered<00:03:24.750> rail<00:03:25.010> and

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
what you need next is powered rail and

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:35.950 
what you need next is powered rail and
you<00:03:26.099> drop<00:03:26.340> in<00:03:26.519> these<00:03:26.700> into<00:03:27.420> these<00:03:27.540> sections

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.300 

and<00:03:36.470> then<00:03:36.830> you're<00:03:37.190> gonna<00:03:37.310> need<00:03:38.860> your<00:03:39.860> normal

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
and then you're gonna need your normal

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.120 
and then you're gonna need your normal
Ralph<00:03:40.640> this<00:03:41.860> drop<00:03:42.860> that<00:03:43.450> into<00:03:44.450> the<00:03:44.630> corners

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
Ralph this drop that into the corners

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:52.660 
Ralph this drop that into the corners
both<00:03:48.850> so<00:03:49.850> that<00:03:50.210> connects<00:03:50.510> that<00:03:50.750> all<00:03:51.310> and<00:03:52.310> then

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
both so that connects that all and then

00:03:52.670 --> 00:04:03.340 
both so that connects that all and then
drop<00:03:53.240> the<00:03:53.390> rail<00:03:53.600> track<00:03:53.930> here<00:04:02.080> I'm<00:04:03.080> going<00:04:03.290> to

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
drop the rail track here I'm going to

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.500 
drop the rail track here I'm going to
explain<00:04:03.740> a<00:04:04.070> little<00:04:04.340> bit<00:04:04.490> more<00:04:04.640> bodies<00:04:05.300> all<00:04:05.480> the

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
explain a little bit more bodies all the

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.840 
explain a little bit more bodies all the
stations<00:04:05.990> in<00:04:06.310> obviously<00:04:07.310> that<00:04:07.370> every<00:04:07.670> time

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
stations in obviously that every time

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:13.030 
stations in obviously that every time
you<00:04:07.970> send<00:04:08.210> a<00:04:08.450> redstone<00:04:08.840> circuit<00:04:09.700> signal<00:04:12.040> to

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
you send a redstone circuit signal to

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.660 
you send a redstone circuit signal to
something<00:04:13.490> then<00:04:13.880> that's<00:04:14.350> it<00:04:15.350> so<00:04:15.770> that's<00:04:16.070> how

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:16.670 
something then that's it so that's how

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:17.830 
something then that's it so that's how
it's<00:04:16.820> going<00:04:16.910> to<00:04:17.000> power<00:04:17.210> it<00:04:17.390> now<00:04:17.540> it's<00:04:17.660> going<00:04:17.780> to

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
it's going to power it now it's going to

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.360 
it's going to power it now it's going to
move<00:04:17.930> and<00:04:18.170> change<00:04:18.200> direction<00:04:18.830> for<00:04:19.130> what<00:04:19.250> it's

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
move and change direction for what it's

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.090 
move and change direction for what it's
going<00:04:19.610> so<00:04:20.020> as<00:04:21.020> you<00:04:21.260> can<00:04:21.380> see<00:04:21.560> sue<00:04:21.770> said<00:04:21.920> I<00:04:21.950> hope

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
going so as you can see sue said I hope

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.040 
going so as you can see sue said I hope
these<00:04:22.400> it<00:04:22.760> is<00:04:22.850> just<00:04:23.060> lined<00:04:23.330> up<00:04:23.570> that's<00:04:23.810> just

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
these it is just lined up that's just

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.900 
these it is just lined up that's just
permanently<00:04:24.320> gonna<00:04:24.590> be<00:04:24.680> going<00:04:24.890> round<00:04:25.130> if<00:04:25.700> we

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
permanently gonna be going round if we

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.390 
permanently gonna be going round if we
hit<00:04:26.060> this<00:04:26.240> button<00:04:26.590> then<00:04:27.590> we<00:04:27.680> get<00:04:27.860> a<00:04:27.890> signal<00:04:28.310> in

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
hit this button then we get a signal in

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.640 
hit this button then we get a signal in
here<00:04:28.460> if<00:04:28.910> we<00:04:29.060> fit<00:04:29.270> down<00:04:29.450> born<00:04:29.720> we<00:04:29.840> get<00:04:30.020> in<00:04:30.380> there

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
here if we fit down born we get in there

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.130 
here if we fit down born we get in there
and<00:04:30.860> so<00:04:31.730> on<00:04:31.910> you<00:04:32.210> can<00:04:32.570> it<00:04:32.720> guess<00:04:32.930> that<00:04:33.110> that

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
and so on you can it guess that that

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.200 
and so on you can it guess that that
obviously<00:04:33.770> follows<00:04:34.040> a<00:04:34.070> pattern<00:04:34.310> so<00:04:35.000> all<00:04:35.090> these

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
obviously follows a pattern so all these

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.730 
obviously follows a pattern so all these
part<00:04:35.510> links<00:04:35.960> when<00:04:36.140> we<00:04:36.260> send<00:04:36.470> the<00:04:36.560> first

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
part links when we send the first

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.790 
part links when we send the first
redstone<00:04:37.340> signal<00:04:37.610> and<00:04:38.260> so<00:04:39.260> we<00:04:39.350> turn<00:04:39.530> on<00:04:39.650> that

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
redstone signal and so we turn on that

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.340 
redstone signal and so we turn on that
switch<00:04:40.190> and<00:04:40.970> then<00:04:41.270> you<00:04:41.390> see<00:04:41.570> how<00:04:41.810> that's<00:04:42.050> now

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
switch and then you see how that's now

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.960 
switch and then you see how that's now
flip<00:04:42.710> that<00:04:43.270> so<00:04:44.680> we<00:04:45.680> then<00:04:45.830> flip<00:04:46.040> it<00:04:46.190> and<00:04:46.340> it<00:04:46.850> goes

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
flip that so we then flip it and it goes

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:54.130 
flip that so we then flip it and it goes
the<00:04:47.180> other<00:04:47.240> way<00:04:47.420> and<00:04:47.630> this<00:04:48.020> is<00:04:48.260> how<00:04:52.810> we<00:04:53.810> decide

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.140 
the other way and this is how we decide

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.390 
the other way and this is how we decide
which<00:04:54.410> way<00:04:55.600> we're<00:04:56.600> going<00:04:56.630> on<00:04:56.900> a<00:04:56.930> minecart<00:04:57.410> so

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
which way we're going on a minecart so

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.400 
which way we're going on a minecart so
they're<00:04:58.760> all<00:04:59.000> linked<00:04:59.330> into<00:04:59.570> a<00:04:59.630> direction<00:04:59.990> so

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
they're all linked into a direction so

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.310 
they're all linked into a direction so
if<00:05:00.680> your<00:05:00.890> coin<00:05:01.190> from<00:05:01.520> this<00:05:01.880> way<00:05:02.140> that<00:05:03.140> will

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
if your coin from this way that will

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.080 
if your coin from this way that will
obviously<00:05:03.440> push<00:05:03.890> you<00:05:04.040> out<00:05:04.220> and<00:05:04.490> you'll

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
obviously push you out and you'll

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.090 
obviously push you out and you'll
continue<00:05:05.210> on<00:05:05.600> your<00:05:05.660> way<00:05:05.720> down<00:05:05.810> there<00:05:06.170> so<00:05:06.890> what

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 
continue on your way down there so what

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.160 
continue on your way down there so what
you<00:05:07.220> then<00:05:07.400> do<00:05:07.610> is<00:05:07.820> you<00:05:08.300> flick<00:05:08.510> the<00:05:08.540> switch<00:05:08.870> then

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.170 
you then do is you flick the switch then

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.110 
you then do is you flick the switch then
that<00:05:09.530> breaks<00:05:09.800> at<00:05:10.040> signal

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
that breaks at signal

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.879 
that breaks at signal
then<00:05:11.270> you'll<00:05:11.570> just<00:05:11.720> continue<00:05:11.930> straight<00:05:12.470> over

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:12.889 
then you'll just continue straight over

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:17.439 
then you'll just continue straight over
these<00:05:13.669> little<00:05:13.940> ramps<00:05:14.330> hold<00:05:14.570> the<00:05:14.690> mine<00:05:14.870> cart<00:05:16.449> so

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:17.449 
these little ramps hold the mine cart so

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:19.750 
these little ramps hold the mine cart so
if<00:05:17.510> we<00:05:17.630> put<00:05:17.780> the<00:05:17.840> my<00:05:17.990> car<00:05:18.290> in<00:05:18.470> there<00:05:18.710> get<00:05:19.490> in<00:05:19.520> the

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
if we put the my car in there get in the

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.750 
if we put the my car in there get in the
mine<00:05:19.910> cart<00:05:20.210> that's<00:05:20.540> certain<00:05:20.960> we<00:05:21.110> hit<00:05:21.320> that<00:05:21.760> we

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
mine cart that's certain we hit that we

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.450 
mine cart that's certain we hit that we
go<00:05:22.880> over<00:05:23.229> we<00:05:24.229> always<00:05:24.410> want<00:05:24.770> to<00:05:24.830> go<00:05:24.919> straight<00:05:25.280> to

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
go over we always want to go straight to

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.310 
go over we always want to go straight to
the<00:05:25.520> next<00:05:25.850> part<00:05:26.090> we<00:05:26.360> want<00:05:26.510> to<00:05:26.600> decide<00:05:26.870> so<00:05:27.199> we

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
the next part we want to decide so we

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.450 
the next part we want to decide so we
want<00:05:27.470> to<00:05:27.530> go<00:05:27.620> straight<00:05:27.860> round<00:05:29.590> so<00:05:30.590> next<00:05:30.919> parts

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
want to go straight round so next parts

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.520 
want to go straight round so next parts
and<00:05:31.610> now<00:05:31.760> we<00:05:31.820> want<00:05:32.030> to<00:05:32.120> come<00:05:32.300> out<00:05:32.479> so<00:05:33.139> we<00:05:33.169> flick

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
and now we want to come out so we flick

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.100 
and now we want to come out so we flick
it<00:05:33.880> press<00:05:34.880> the<00:05:35.090> bolt<00:05:35.240> on<00:05:35.500> and<00:05:36.500> then<00:05:36.650> we're<00:05:36.800> out

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
it press the bolt on and then we're out

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.409 
it press the bolt on and then we're out
and<00:05:39.110> it's<00:05:39.380> as<00:05:39.560> simple<00:05:39.889> as<00:05:40.160> that<00:05:40.370> it<00:05:40.850> really

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
and it's as simple as that it really

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:42.969 
and it's as simple as that it really
doesn't<00:05:41.810> take<00:05:41.840> long<00:05:42.110> to<00:05:42.169> build<00:05:42.470> and<00:05:42.830> then

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:42.979 
doesn't take long to build and then

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:45.480 
doesn't take long to build and then
obviously<00:05:43.130> you<00:05:43.400> can<00:05:43.550> spend<00:05:43.820> your<00:05:43.880> time

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
obviously you can spend your time

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:51.040 
obviously you can spend your time
beginning<00:05:46.490> to<00:05:46.729> tidy<00:05:47.300> it<00:05:47.419> all<00:05:47.570> up<00:05:49.900> you<00:05:50.900> can

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
beginning to tidy it all up you can

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.600 
beginning to tidy it all up you can
experiment<00:05:51.380> around<00:05:51.680> and<00:05:52.039> you<00:05:52.100> can<00:05:52.340> hide<00:05:52.580> the

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
experiment around and you can hide the

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.689 
experiment around and you can hide the
redstone<00:05:53.240> you<00:05:53.630> know<00:05:53.870> trail<00:05:54.260> bits<00:05:54.800> off<00:05:55.039> hide<00:05:55.520> it

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:55.699 
redstone you know trail bits off hide it

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:57.070 
redstone you know trail bits off hide it
in<00:05:55.789> walls<00:05:56.000> and<00:05:56.270> stuff<00:05:56.449> it's<00:05:56.660> just<00:05:56.690> up<00:05:56.930> to<00:05:56.960> you

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
in walls and stuff it's just up to you

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.210 
in walls and stuff it's just up to you
how<00:05:57.380> you<00:05:57.410> want<00:05:57.530> to<00:05:57.680> do<00:05:57.770> it<00:05:59.440> but<00:06:00.440> I<00:06:00.500> tend<00:06:00.889> to<00:06:01.039> find

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.220 
how you want to do it but I tend to find

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.500 
how you want to do it but I tend to find
that's<00:06:01.430> been<00:06:01.669> one<00:06:01.789> of<00:06:01.850> the<00:06:02.410> best<00:06:03.410> setups<00:06:03.949> that

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.510 
that's been one of the best setups that

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:08.170 
that's been one of the best setups that
we've<00:06:05.510> been<00:06:05.720> using<00:06:05.780> anyway<00:06:06.410> now<00:06:07.340> again<00:06:07.729> if

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180 
we've been using anyway now again if

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.620
