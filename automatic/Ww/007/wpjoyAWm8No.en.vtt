that's good alright okay great and then
now<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.530> course<00:01:53.159> we<00:01:53.340> need<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.520> reduce<00:01:53.850> the

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
now of course we need to reduce the

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.570 
now of course we need to reduce the
power<00:01:54.259> cut<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.350> down<00:01:55.439> by<00:01:55.500> one<00:01:55.740> stop

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
power cut it down by one stop

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.150 
power cut it down by one stop
great<00:01:58.270> and<00:01:58.510> then<00:01:58.750> we<00:01:58.960> will<00:01:59.110> now<00:02:00.030> take<00:02:01.030> a<00:02:01.090> shot

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
great and then we will now take a shot

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.620 
great and then we will now take a shot
and<00:02:03.160> now<00:02:03.400> look<00:02:03.670> what<00:02:03.820> happens<00:02:04.120> when<00:02:04.210> I<00:02:04.330> just

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
and now look what happens when I just

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.320 
and now look what happens when I just
put<00:02:04.840> the<00:02:04.930> softbox<00:02:05.380> nearer<00:02:06.130> to<00:02:06.640> the<00:02:06.910> subject

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
put the softbox nearer to the subject

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.310 
put the softbox nearer to the subject
look<00:02:07.420> at<00:02:07.510> the<00:02:07.570> background<00:02:07.930> the<00:02:07.990> backgrounds

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
look at the background the backgrounds

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.530 
look at the background the backgrounds
got<00:02:08.470> a<00:02:08.500> lot<00:02:09.250> darker<00:02:09.550> and<00:02:09.940> at<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.119> same<00:02:10.270> time

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
got a lot darker and at the same time

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.270 
got a lot darker and at the same time
the<00:02:10.750> shadow<00:02:11.020> has<00:02:11.290> gotten<00:02:11.620> actually<00:02:11.830> a<00:02:12.040> little

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
the shadow has gotten actually a little

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.880 
the shadow has gotten actually a little
bit<00:02:12.370> softer<00:02:12.910> less<00:02:13.660> distracting<00:02:14.230> compared<00:02:14.680> to

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
bit softer less distracting compared to

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.180 
bit softer less distracting compared to
the<00:02:15.220> previous<00:02:15.700> shot<00:02:16.440> so<00:02:17.440> we've<00:02:17.620> seen<00:02:17.890> that<00:02:18.130> the

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
the previous shot so we've seen that the

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.070 
the previous shot so we've seen that the
shot<00:02:18.580> looks<00:02:18.820> a<00:02:18.940> lot<00:02:19.270> better<00:02:19.540> now<00:02:19.780> the

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
shot looks a lot better now the

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.690 
shot looks a lot better now the
background<00:02:20.590> is<00:02:20.740> a<00:02:20.770> lot<00:02:20.950> darker<00:02:21.190> there's<00:02:21.490> a<00:02:21.520> lot

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
background is a lot darker there's a lot

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.850 
background is a lot darker there's a lot
more<00:02:21.880> separation<00:02:22.540> but<00:02:22.870> what<00:02:23.140> if<00:02:23.410> you<00:02:23.650> actually

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
more separation but what if you actually

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.220 
more separation but what if you actually
find<00:02:24.250> that<00:02:24.430> background<00:02:24.760> is<00:02:24.940> just<00:02:25.210> a<00:02:25.990> little

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
find that background is just a little

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.320 
find that background is just a little
bit<00:02:26.380> too<00:02:26.650> dark<00:02:27.250> and<00:02:27.490> you<00:02:27.610> want<00:02:27.760> to<00:02:27.850> brighten<00:02:28.240> up

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
bit too dark and you want to brighten up

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.510 
bit too dark and you want to brighten up
a<00:02:28.390> little<00:02:28.600> bit<00:02:28.780> but<00:02:29.410> you<00:02:29.530> don't<00:02:29.770> want<00:02:30.160> to<00:02:30.220> alter

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
a little bit but you don't want to alter

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.250 
a little bit but you don't want to alter
the<00:02:30.610> contrast<00:02:31.090> and<00:02:31.270> tonality<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:31.900> beautiful

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
the contrast and tonality the beautiful

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.810 
the contrast and tonality the beautiful
tonality<00:02:32.500> you've<00:02:32.740> got<00:02:32.980> right<00:02:33.190> now<00:02:33.220> on<00:02:33.610> the

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
tonality you've got right now on the

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.220 
tonality you've got right now on the
front<00:02:34.060> of<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.210> box<00:02:34.390> we've<00:02:34.540> got<00:02:34.570> that<00:02:34.960> nice

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
front of the box we've got that nice

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.350 
front of the box we've got that nice
little<00:02:35.470> gradation<00:02:36.010> so<00:02:36.160> what<00:02:36.280> you<00:02:36.340> do<00:02:36.460> is<00:02:36.610> we're

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
little gradation so what you do is we're

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.130 
little gradation so what you do is we're
going<00:02:37.480> to<00:02:37.540> do<00:02:37.630> right<00:02:37.720> now<00:02:37.780> is<00:02:37.960> you're<00:02:38.080> just

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
going to do right now is you're just

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.380 
going to do right now is you're just
going<00:02:38.230> to<00:02:38.350> rotate<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.860> softbox<00:02:39.370> by<00:02:39.670> 90

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
going to rotate the softbox by 90

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.160 
going to rotate the softbox by 90
degrees<00:02:40.690> all<00:02:40.870> right

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
degrees all right

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.220 
degrees all right
and<00:02:41.260> here<00:02:41.740> we<00:02:41.830> go<00:02:42.420> I'm<00:02:43.420> going<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:43.600> turn<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:43.930> and

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
and here we go I'm going to turn it and

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.430 
and here we go I'm going to turn it and
here<00:02:44.740> we<00:02:44.770> go<00:02:44.950> as<00:02:45.100> you<00:02:45.130> can<00:02:45.280> see<00:02:45.550> and<00:02:46.440> we're

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
here we go as you can see and we're

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.230 
here we go as you can see and we're
going<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:47.620> take<00:02:47.800> a<00:02:47.830> shot<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:51.040> once<00:02:51.640> we<00:02:51.880> turn

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
going to take a shot and once we turn

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.050 
going to take a shot and once we turn
the<00:02:52.360> softbox<00:02:52.780> 90<00:02:53.170> degrees<00:02:53.730> horizontal<00:02:54.730> look

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
the softbox 90 degrees horizontal look

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.060 
the softbox 90 degrees horizontal look
at<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:55.270> mob<00:02:55.450> like<00:02:55.780> that's<00:02:56.050> got<00:02:56.290> a<00:02:56.500> little<00:02:56.920> bit

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
at the mob like that's got a little bit

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.220 
at the mob like that's got a little bit
more<00:02:57.310> onto<00:02:57.430> the<00:02:57.670> background<00:02:57.850> hand<00:02:58.270> hands<00:02:59.140> in

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
more onto the background hand hands in

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.840 
more onto the background hand hands in
the<00:02:59.350> upper<00:02:59.890> left<00:03:00.250> hand<00:03:00.370> corner<00:03:00.490> the

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
the upper left hand corner the

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.510 
the upper left hand corner the
background<00:03:01.300> is<00:03:01.420> just<00:03:01.450> a<00:03:01.870> little<00:03:02.110> bit<00:03:02.260> brighter

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
background is just a little bit brighter

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.680 
background is just a little bit brighter
so<00:03:03.520> we've<00:03:03.880> seen<00:03:04.060> that<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.300> background<00:03:04.480> has

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
so we've seen that the background has

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.690 
so we've seen that the background has
gotten<00:03:05.200> a<00:03:05.230> little<00:03:05.380> bit<00:03:05.590> brighter<00:03:05.950> but<00:03:06.430> what<00:03:06.580> if

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
gotten a little bit brighter but what if

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.699 
gotten a little bit brighter but what if
we<00:03:06.850> want<00:03:07.090> to<00:03:07.239> make<00:03:07.540> it<00:03:07.690> just<00:03:07.720> a<00:03:08.410> little<00:03:08.440> bit

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
we want to make it just a little bit

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.290 
we want to make it just a little bit
brighter<00:03:08.920> but<00:03:09.130> we<00:03:09.370> don't<00:03:09.520> add<00:03:09.760> another<00:03:10.030> like

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
brighter but we don't add another like

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.720 
brighter but we don't add another like
no<00:03:10.510> reflectors<00:03:11.050> none<00:03:11.290> whatsoever<00:03:11.470> all<00:03:12.430> we

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
no reflectors none whatsoever all we

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.850 
no reflectors none whatsoever all we
have<00:03:12.850> to<00:03:12.970> do<00:03:13.060> is<00:03:13.209> just<00:03:13.450> turn<00:03:13.660> the<00:03:13.840> softbox<00:03:14.380> just

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
have to do is just turn the softbox just

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.370 
have to do is just turn the softbox just
a<00:03:15.040> little<00:03:15.310> bit<00:03:15.430> about<00:03:15.640> 15<00:03:16.060> 20<00:03:16.330> degrees<00:03:16.630> towards

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
a little bit about 15 20 degrees towards

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.199 
a little bit about 15 20 degrees towards
the<00:03:17.440> background<00:03:17.920> so<00:03:18.100> what<00:03:18.190> will<00:03:18.340> happen<00:03:18.370> is<00:03:18.820> in

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
the background so what will happen is in

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.479 
the background so what will happen is in
essence<00:03:19.600> is<00:03:19.750> that<00:03:19.780> more<00:03:20.590> of<00:03:20.680> the<00:03:20.920> light<00:03:21.160> would

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
essence is that more of the light would

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.479 
essence is that more of the light would
be<00:03:21.820> spilling<00:03:22.270> onto<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:22.900> background<00:03:23.470> but<00:03:24.220> yet

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
be spilling onto the background but yet

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.390 
be spilling onto the background but yet
we<00:03:24.670> achieve<00:03:25.440> minimal<00:03:26.440> alteration<00:03:27.100> to<00:03:27.280> the

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
we achieve minimal alteration to the

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.520 
we achieve minimal alteration to the
tonality<00:03:27.760> to<00:03:28.180> the<00:03:28.300> box<00:03:28.540> all<00:03:28.750> right<00:03:28.870> and<00:03:29.140> here
