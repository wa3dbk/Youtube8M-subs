into<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.450> currents<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.170> three<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.920> four

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
into the currents so that three and four

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.819 
into the currents so that three and four
guys<00:00:50.340> can<00:00:50.760> fish<00:00:51.030> at<00:00:51.300> once<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:52.050> ass<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.500> drop

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
out here now I'm going to sink my micro

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.459 
out here now I'm going to sink my micro
now<00:00:56.370> instead<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.149> being<00:00:57.270> nosed<00:00:57.899> into<00:00:58.260> the

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
now instead of being nosed into the

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.740 
now instead of being nosed into the
current<00:00:58.829> or<00:00:59.160> Stern<00:00:59.699> into<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.210> current<00:01:00.539> nose

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
current or Stern into the current nose

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.950 
current or Stern into the current nose
down<00:01:01.050> current<00:01:01.500> I'm<00:01:01.620> completely<00:01:02.520> sideways<00:01:03.030> and

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
down current I'm completely sideways and

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.550 
down current I'm completely sideways and
you<00:01:04.140> can<00:01:04.320> see<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.710> current<00:01:05.119> bending<00:01:06.560> the

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
you can see the current bending the

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.539 
you can see the current bending the
micro<00:01:08.720> peeling<00:01:09.720> off<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:11.010> power<00:01:11.250> pole

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
micro peeling off it and the power pole

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.359 
micro peeling off it and the power pole
in<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.880> stern<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:13.080> we're<00:01:13.380> not<00:01:13.500> moving<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:14.130> bit

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
in the stern and we're not moving a bit

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.820 
in the stern and we're not moving a bit
I've<00:01:14.880> got<00:01:15.150> my<00:01:15.360> boat<00:01:15.570> parallel<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.680> this

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
I've got my boat parallel to this

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.280 
I've got my boat parallel to this
pothole<00:01:17.369> whereas<00:01:18.240> before<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.720> could<00:01:19.110> only

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
pothole whereas before I could only

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.490 
pothole whereas before I could only
maybe<00:01:19.619> fish<00:01:19.979> one<00:01:20.700> or<00:01:20.909> two<00:01:21.090> guys<00:01:21.360> throwing<00:01:22.320> in

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
maybe fish one or two guys throwing in

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.249 
maybe fish one or two guys throwing in
now<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.040> can<00:01:23.460> line<00:01:23.670> three<00:01:24.360> guys<00:01:24.570> down<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.049> side

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
now I can line three guys down the side

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.810 
now I can line three guys down the side
of<00:01:25.409> my<00:01:25.500> boat<00:01:25.680> down<00:01:25.920> my<00:01:26.130> gun<00:01:26.310> all<00:01:26.430> on<00:01:26.520> my<00:01:26.640> boat
