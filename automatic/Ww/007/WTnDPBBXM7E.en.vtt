just give it a real natural feel and we

would check in making sure it's nice and
hot<00:00:54.469> and<00:00:54.980> it<00:00:55.820> should<00:00:56.059> leave<00:00:56.270> it<00:00:56.420> in<00:00:56.570> this

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
hot and it should leave it in this

hot and it should leave it in this
corkscrew<00:00:57.200> feel<00:00:57.739> and<00:00:58.180> it<00:00:59.180> doesn't<00:00:59.420> have<00:00:59.539> to<00:00:59.690> be

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
corkscrew feel and it doesn't have to be

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:01.240 
corkscrew feel and it doesn't have to be
too<00:00:59.989> neat<00:01:00.230> so<00:01:00.500> when<00:01:00.649> you're<00:01:00.770> wrapping<00:01:00.980> the

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
too neat so when you're wrapping the

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.799 
too neat so when you're wrapping the
hair<00:01:01.399> around<00:01:01.550> it<00:01:01.820> you<00:01:01.940> can<00:01:02.120> twist<00:01:02.450> the<00:01:02.600> hair

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
hair around it you can twist the hair

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:04.570 
hair around it you can twist the hair
and<00:01:03.020> leave<00:01:03.200> it<00:01:03.350> more<00:01:03.620> natural<00:01:03.829> just<00:01:04.520> to

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
and leave it more natural just to

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.090 
and leave it more natural just to
emulate<00:01:05.030> that<00:01:05.180> real<00:01:05.360> beachy<00:01:05.720> texture<00:01:06.440> so<00:01:06.979> we

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
emulate that real beachy texture so we

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.560 
emulate that real beachy texture so we
took<00:01:07.280> the<00:01:07.430> other<00:01:07.610> side<00:01:07.880> now<00:01:08.090> wrapped<00:01:08.420> it

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
took the other side now wrapped it

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.900 
took the other side now wrapped it
around<00:01:08.660> the<00:01:09.140> Tresemme<00:01:09.560> wand<00:01:09.860> we're<00:01:10.610> leaving

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:10.910 
around the Tresemme wand we're leaving

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.670 
around the Tresemme wand we're leaving
the<00:01:10.940> end<00:01:11.149> out<00:01:11.450> this<00:01:11.600> it's<00:01:11.810> really<00:01:12.200> important

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
the end out this it's really important

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.440 
the end out this it's really important
to<00:01:12.740> create<00:01:12.979> a<00:01:13.130> natural<00:01:13.340> look<00:01:13.759> so<00:01:14.210> it<00:01:14.300> doesn't

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
to create a natural look so it doesn't

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.260 
to create a natural look so it doesn't
look<00:01:14.660> too<00:01:14.899> quaffed<00:01:15.350> and<00:01:15.680> to<00:01:15.890> done<00:01:16.130> so<00:01:17.000> again

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
look too quaffed and to done so again

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.850 
look too quaffed and to done so again
working<00:01:17.539> up<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:17.930> back<00:01:18.080> of<00:01:18.259> the<00:01:18.320> head<00:01:18.470> once<00:01:18.680> we

working up the back of the head once we

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.969 
working up the back of the head once we
finish<00:01:19.160> that<00:01:19.310> section<00:01:19.789> we're<00:01:20.300> taking<00:01:20.979> another

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
finish that section we're taking another

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.089 
finish that section we're taking another
large<00:01:22.340> section<00:01:23.030> and<00:01:23.349> clipping<00:01:24.349> this<00:01:24.500> up<00:01:24.709> out

00:01:25.089 --> 00:01:25.099 
large section and clipping this up out

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:28.300 
large section and clipping this up out
of<00:01:25.160> the<00:01:25.459> way<00:01:26.170> and<00:01:27.170> repeating<00:01:27.679> the<00:01:27.830> same<00:01:28.039> the

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
of the way and repeating the same the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.520 
of the way and repeating the same the
opposite<00:01:28.729> side<00:01:28.940> so<00:01:29.569> if<00:01:29.690> it<00:01:29.780> has<00:01:29.899> freshly

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
opposite side so if it has freshly

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.080 
opposite side so if it has freshly
washed<00:01:30.709> and<00:01:31.039> you<00:01:31.160> just<00:01:31.310> need<00:01:31.490> that<00:01:31.670> little<00:01:31.729> bit

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
washed and you just need that little bit

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.120 
washed and you just need that little bit
of<00:01:32.209> hold<00:01:32.479> you<00:01:33.289> can<00:01:33.470> always<00:01:33.709> coat<00:01:33.950> it<00:01:34.099> with

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
of hold you can always coat it with

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.460 
of hold you can always coat it with
trazim<00:01:34.610> a<00:01:34.670> 24<00:01:35.240> hour<00:01:35.450> body<00:01:35.660> finishing<00:01:36.259> spray

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
trazim a 24 hour body finishing spray

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.949 
trazim a 24 hour body finishing spray
and<00:01:37.099> you<00:01:37.220> just<00:01:37.429> spray<00:01:37.880> it<00:01:37.910> on<00:01:38.119> lightly<00:01:38.630> from

00:01:38.949 --> 00:01:38.959 
and you just spray it on lightly from

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:41.020 
and you just spray it on lightly from
the<00:01:39.050> distance<00:01:39.500> don't<00:01:39.770> make<00:01:39.920> it<00:01:40.099> too<00:01:40.310> wet<00:01:40.340> and

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
the distance don't make it too wet and

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.190 
the distance don't make it too wet and
then<00:01:41.780> you<00:01:42.349> can<00:01:42.500> curl<00:01:42.770> it<00:01:43.660> this<00:01:44.660> helps<00:01:44.929> to<00:01:45.050> give

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
then you can curl it this helps to give

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.490 
then you can curl it this helps to give
just<00:01:45.410> a<00:01:45.500> little<00:01:45.740> bit<00:01:45.860> more<00:01:46.039> hold<00:01:47.140> so<00:01:48.140> again<00:01:48.380> we

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
just a little bit more hold so again we

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.130 
just a little bit more hold so again we
can<00:01:48.709> take<00:01:48.920> huge<00:01:49.340> sections<00:01:49.940> so<00:01:50.509> this<00:01:50.690> is<00:01:50.840> all<00:01:51.020> at

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
can take huge sections so this is all at

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.529 
can take huge sections so this is all at
the<00:01:51.229> side<00:01:51.440> of<00:01:51.470> the<00:01:51.649> head<00:01:51.770> and<00:01:52.069> wrap<00:01:53.000> around<00:01:53.030> the

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
the side of the head and wrap around the

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:56.260 
the side of the head and wrap around the
wand<00:01:53.780> so<00:01:54.679> just<00:01:54.890> use<00:01:55.190> your<00:01:55.399> finger<00:01:55.700> to<00:01:55.729> check<00:01:56.090> if

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
wand so just use your finger to check if

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.620 
wand so just use your finger to check if
it's<00:01:56.450> heated<00:01:58.060> sufficiently<00:01:59.060> before<00:01:59.509> you

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
it's heated sufficiently before you

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.160 
it's heated sufficiently before you
release<00:01:59.810> it<00:02:01.330> so<00:02:02.330> if<00:02:02.420> you've<00:02:02.569> got<00:02:02.599> hair<00:02:02.929> that's

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170
