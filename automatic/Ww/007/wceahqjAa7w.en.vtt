there<00:00:07.770> are<00:00:07.919> two<00:00:08.130> types<00:00:08.400> of<00:00:08.550> ice<00:00:08.760> that<00:00:08.970> you<00:00:09.120> find

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
there are two types of ice that you find

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.640 
there are two types of ice that you find
in<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.690> solar<00:00:09.929> system

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
in the solar system

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.379 
in the solar system
there's<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.400> crystalline<00:00:11.880> ice<00:00:12.030> that<00:00:12.269> you

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
there's the crystalline ice that you

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.360 
there's the crystalline ice that you
will<00:00:12.540> find<00:00:12.719> in<00:00:12.900> your<00:00:12.990> freezer<00:00:13.290> but<00:00:14.160> there's

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
will find in your freezer but there's

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.519 
will find in your freezer but there's
also<00:00:14.519> talk<00:00:14.880> of<00:00:15.059> eyes<00:00:15.210> called<00:00:15.509> amorphous<00:00:16.139> which

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
also talk of eyes called amorphous which

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.650 
also talk of eyes called amorphous which
lacks<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:17.100> regular<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.550> geometrical<00:00:18.330> pattern

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
lacks a regular a geometrical pattern

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.019 
lacks a regular a geometrical pattern
for<00:00:18.900> its<00:00:19.020> molecules<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:20.369> more<00:00:20.520> precise<00:00:20.820> is

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.269 
for its molecules and more precise is
not<00:00:21.210> something<00:00:21.630> you<00:00:21.750> naturally<00:00:22.350> find<00:00:23.039> on

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
not something you naturally find on

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.130 
not something you naturally find on
earth<00:00:23.310> because<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.269> temperatures<00:00:24.779> and

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
earth because the temperatures and

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.410 
earth because the temperatures and
pressures<00:00:25.199> are<00:00:25.769> much<00:00:25.890> higher<00:00:26.099> on<00:00:26.160> earth<00:00:26.580> the

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
pressures are much higher on earth the

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.910 
pressures are much higher on earth the
way<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.720> we<00:00:27.840> make<00:00:28.019> our<00:00:28.170> ice<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.619> we<00:00:28.740> use<00:00:28.890> a

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
way that we make our ice is we use a

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.519 
way that we make our ice is we use a
small<00:00:29.300> evacuated<00:00:30.300> chamber<00:00:30.330> we<00:00:30.900> pump<00:00:31.260> all<00:00:31.410> the

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
small evacuated chamber we pump all the

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.010 
small evacuated chamber we pump all the
air<00:00:31.679> out<00:00:31.759> we<00:00:32.759> have<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:32.940> small<00:00:33.300> metal<00:00:33.660> disc<00:00:33.840> about

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
air out we have a small metal disc about

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.870 
air out we have a small metal disc about
the<00:00:34.260> size<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.710> quarter<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.309> we<00:00:35.430> cool<00:00:35.670> down

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
the size of a quarter that we cool down

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.750 
the size of a quarter that we cool down
just<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.360> few<00:00:36.540> degrees<00:00:36.630> above<00:00:36.899> absolute<00:00:37.320> zero

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
just a few degrees above absolute zero

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.250 
just a few degrees above absolute zero
we<00:00:38.760> flew<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.000> gas<00:00:39.270> on<00:00:39.510> top<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.140> gas

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
we flew a gas on top of it the gas

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.200 
we flew a gas on top of it the gas
freezes<00:00:40.800> on<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.040> metal<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.670> we<00:00:41.820> can<00:00:42.000> study

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
freezes on the metal and we can study

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.880 
freezes on the metal and we can study
the<00:00:42.450> way<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.809> light<00:00:42.989> reflects<00:00:43.469> off<00:00:43.680> that

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
the way that light reflects off that

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.700 
the way that light reflects off that
metal<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.700> tell<00:00:44.879> us<00:00:45.000> what<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.239> ice<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.570> like<00:00:45.719> so

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
metal to tell us what the ice is like so

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.110 
metal to tell us what the ice is like so
one<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.100> things<00:00:47.309> that<00:00:47.520> makes<00:00:47.700> our<00:00:47.910> lab

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
one of the things that makes our lab

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.590 
one of the things that makes our lab
unique<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:49.260> we<00:00:50.190> can<00:00:50.399> study<00:00:50.670> cosmic<00:00:51.210> ices

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
unique is that we can study cosmic ices

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.900 
unique is that we can study cosmic ices
when<00:00:51.870> they're<00:00:52.079> exposed<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.949> high<00:00:53.699> energy

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
when they're exposed to high energy

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.720 
when they're exposed to high energy
protons<00:00:54.660> from<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.500> vandegraaff<00:00:56.100> accelerator

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
protons from a vandegraaff accelerator

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.529 
protons from a vandegraaff accelerator
so<00:00:57.570> we<00:00:57.780> can<00:00:57.930> bombard<00:00:58.170> our<00:00:58.530> ices<00:00:58.980> with<00:00:59.539> protons

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
so we can bombard our ices with protons

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.590 
so we can bombard our ices with protons
that<00:01:00.809> have<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.500> million<00:01:01.920> volts<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.489> energy<00:01:02.600> the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
that have a million volts of energy the

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.740 
that have a million volts of energy the
data<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:04.080> we<00:01:04.500> measure<00:01:04.739> can<00:01:05.430> be<00:01:05.460> used<00:01:05.939> in

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
data that we measure can be used in

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.719 
data that we measure can be used in
order<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.170> interpret<00:01:07.590> observations<00:01:08.520> and

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
order to interpret observations and

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.469 
order to interpret observations and
astronomers<00:01:09.270> make<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.990> cosmic<00:01:10.470> ices<00:01:10.799> in<00:01:10.950> space

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
astronomers make of cosmic ices in space

astronomers make of cosmic ices in space
most<00:01:12.479> people<00:01:12.840> would<00:01:13.290> put<00:01:13.799> compounds<00:01:14.369> in

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
most people would put compounds in

liquid water at room temperature and

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.399

study<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.280> chemistry<00:01:17.610> like<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.630> but<00:01:18.930> we're

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
study the chemistry like that but we're

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.350 
study the chemistry like that but we're
studying<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.950> chemistry<00:01:20.460> in<00:01:20.670> ice<00:01:21.000> at

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
historically people may not have thought

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.850 
historically people may not have thought
that<00:01:25.210> it<00:01:25.630> could<00:01:25.660> be<00:01:25.960> any<00:01:26.080> chemistry<00:01:26.530> at<00:01:26.710> those

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860
