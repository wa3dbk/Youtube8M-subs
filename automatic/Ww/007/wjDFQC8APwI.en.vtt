00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.530
 thankfully I think the debates 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:23.290
 Social allow reinstate the school 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:25.930
 and be able to think that the school is a 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.779
 social institution I think that the opportune thing 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:32.349
 to think about the open school axis 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:35.910
 the school as a social institution 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:39.770
 it seems to me that then it allows 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.470
 give the school this category of 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.020
 nodal signifier 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.180
 but the commitment to be able to build 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.630
 that significant see what are the 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.980
 meanings of the school as 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:56.730
 social institution 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.280
 and how to rearm the school no longer in the 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.270
 framework of modern speech but in the 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.860
 frame of another speech 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:08.690
 temporarily and we can think 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:12.340
 postmodern this I think it is 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:15.700
 temporary this is 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.270
 let's borrow it as a way of 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.130
 call him 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.390
 I think we have to if there is a 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.320
 security in all this is that it is not 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.930
 modern that is something else 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:29.310
 coming 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:32.070
 to think that fissure 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.579
 so when I say the speech 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:39.070
 educational has a constitutive fissure 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.970
 has has a brand one 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.970
 a break up 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:49.940
 constitutive between the modern 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.549
 / what gave rise to the school 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.430
 see if it's a brand really like 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.409
 very important 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:02.979
 it's almost not 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:05.350
 not because I was going to say that it's almost like 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.869
 the significant family but in reality 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.390
 the significant family is also re 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.299
 institutes in modernity with the 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.330
 family type but prior to this prior to 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:19.750
 modernity did not even exist as 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:23.910
 family category but there were ways of 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.910
 bond and group together to live 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.530
 then I think it is still much 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.530
 broader in the family category 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.950
 that actually intersects with the category 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.950
 school 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:40.780
 but the school speech 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.490
 educational or modern that is partly 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.230
 build with the school has this 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.670
 constitutive rupture that if not the 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.490
 we recognize 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.630
 we are in a major problem because 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:01.260
 we can not understand 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:03.410
 because there are so different practices 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:08.870
 why 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:12.600
 there are elements that come to us from this 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.700
 modern school 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:19.200
 but because there are other elements that are 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:22.500
 unpublished that appear that come out many 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.760
 without knowing because many without recognizing 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:29.430
 which 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:33.130
 the provenance I say where they come from 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.050
 or with provenance articulated the 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.140
 school violence today has a 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.060
 origin articulated by multiple 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.060
 factors 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.060
 extracurricular 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:52.990
 the ways of reconstructing spaces 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:56.460
 inside the school 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.460
 also has 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:02.190
 in principle unpublished questions as 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.760
 the technologies technologies 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:10.860
 digitally altered much space in 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:15.200
 the school did not allow to think that 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.200
 simultaneity was not necessary 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.579
 what 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.400
 it is not necessary for someone to be facing 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.979
 to others 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.300
 lets think about the metaphor of the network 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:30.600
 as horizontal relationships 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:35.490
 then notice as 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:39.090
 are nodal signifiers that we started 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:41.550
 to see that there are already known situations 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:45.330
 that come from the speech that come from 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:48.690
 that are prior to this break that 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:52.860
 they are inscribed in modernity but that 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:57.169
 there is also something new about what 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:05:00.699
 unpublished that bursts but that combines 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:00.699
 with what already exists
