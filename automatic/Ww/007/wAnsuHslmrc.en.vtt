ground now when we go back and we take a

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.400 
ground now when we go back and we take a
look<00:02:08.640> at<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.910> good<00:02:09.090> here

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
look at the good here

look at the good here
the<00:02:10.040> route<00:02:10.280> running<00:02:10.610> does<00:02:10.940> seem<00:02:11.180> to<00:02:11.210> be<00:02:11.360> a

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
the route running does seem to be a

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.390 
the route running does seem to be a
little<00:02:11.810> bit<00:02:11.930> improved<00:02:12.470> or<00:02:12.680> maybe<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:13.040> defense

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
little bit improved or maybe the defense

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.750 
little bit improved or maybe the defense
just<00:02:13.640> doesn't<00:02:13.970> react<00:02:14.300> to<00:02:14.570> it<00:02:14.600> as<00:02:15.280> jumpy<00:02:16.280> so<00:02:16.700> to

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
just doesn't react to it as jumpy so to

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.250 
just doesn't react to it as jumpy so to
speak<00:02:17.060> as<00:02:17.270> they<00:02:17.420> would<00:02:17.600> have<00:02:17.690> before<00:02:17.810> Alan

quick<00:02:26.120> feet<00:02:27.050> reactions<00:02:27.830> you<00:02:28.460> can<00:02:28.640> see<00:02:28.850> that

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
quick feet reactions you can see that

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.700 
quick feet reactions you can see that
he's<00:02:29.150> kind<00:02:29.810> of<00:02:29.930> reading<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.380> zone<00:02:30.590> a<00:02:30.620> little

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710

overpowering it seems like sometimes and

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.640 
overpowering it seems like sometimes and
this<00:02:40.700> is<00:02:40.850> an<00:02:40.970> example<00:02:41.300> of<00:02:41.600> it<00:02:41.750> the<00:02:42.080> defense

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
this is an example of it the defense

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.520
