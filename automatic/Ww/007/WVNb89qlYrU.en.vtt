just a little mechanism here but we
don't<00:00:38.280> need<00:00:38.520> this<00:00:38.670> mechanism

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
don't need this mechanism

take<00:01:27.229> these<00:01:27.470> two<00:01:27.680> little<00:01:27.710> carriage<00:01:28.190> bolts

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
take these two little carriage bolts

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.190 
take these two little carriage bolts
they<00:01:28.940> line<00:01:29.149> up<00:01:29.330> perfectly<00:01:29.360> with<00:01:29.810> the<00:01:29.990> holes

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
they line up perfectly with the holes

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.830 
they line up perfectly with the holes
and<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:30.979> crankshaft<00:01:31.280> down<00:01:31.700> there<00:01:31.940> this<00:01:32.570> part

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
and the crankshaft down there this part

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.770 
and the crankshaft down there this part
here<00:01:33.200> you<00:01:33.380> see<00:01:34.100> and<00:01:34.310> these<00:01:35.270> two<00:01:35.479> carriage

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
here you see and these two carriage

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.469 
here you see and these two carriage
bolts<00:01:35.930> goes<00:01:36.710> into<00:01:37.069> two<00:01:37.819> of<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:38.060> holes<00:01:38.240> that

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
bolts goes into two of the holes that

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.899 
bolts goes into two of the holes that
are<00:01:38.630> line<00:01:38.869> up<00:01:39.050> vertically<00:01:39.740> and<00:01:39.979> the<00:01:40.520> top<00:01:40.700> bed

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
are line up vertically and the top bed

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:42.370 
are line up vertically and the top bed
Cinemark<00:01:41.420> is<00:01:41.569> on<00:01:41.899> the<00:01:41.960> bottom<00:01:42.200> of<00:01:42.259> that

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
Cinemark is on the bottom of that

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.690 
Cinemark is on the bottom of that
crankshaft<00:01:42.679> so<00:01:43.009> you<00:01:43.100> have<00:01:43.340> that<00:01:43.550> at<00:01:43.640> the

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
crankshaft so you have that at the

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.300 
crankshaft so you have that at the
bottom<00:01:43.909> and<00:01:44.179> it's<00:01:44.659> a<00:01:44.720> top<00:01:44.899> dead<00:01:45.110> center<00:01:45.409> only

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
bottom and it's a top dead center only

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.570 
bottom and it's a top dead center only
if<00:01:46.520> your<00:01:47.420> camshafts<00:01:48.050> are<00:01:48.350> line<00:01:49.100> with<00:01:49.310> the<00:01:49.369> Lima

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
if your camshafts are line with the Lima

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.279 
if your camshafts are line with the Lima
doors<00:01:50.319> so<00:01:51.319> you<00:01:51.560> can<00:01:52.460> chapter<00:01:52.970> line<00:01:53.289> your

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
doors so you can chapter line your

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:56.200 
doors so you can chapter line your
crankshaft<00:01:54.679> is<00:01:54.950> at<00:01:55.069> top<00:01:55.220> dead<00:01:55.399> center<00:01:55.670> you

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
crankshaft is at top dead center you

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.590 
crankshaft is at top dead center you
slide<00:01:56.539> these<00:01:56.750> two<00:01:56.810> bolts<00:01:57.319> into<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:58.220> side<00:01:58.600> bolt

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
slide these two bolts into the side bolt

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.990 
slide these two bolts into the side bolt
holes<00:01:59.810> that<00:02:00.710> will<00:02:00.890> keep<00:02:01.069> it<00:02:01.220> vertically

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
holes that will keep it vertically

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.199 
holes that will keep it vertically
aligned<00:02:02.600> and<00:02:02.979> this<00:02:03.979> has<00:02:04.490> to<00:02:04.640> make<00:02:04.789> contact

00:02:05.199 --> 00:02:05.209 
aligned and this has to make contact

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:09.310 
aligned and this has to make contact
with<00:02:05.390> the<00:02:05.720> water<00:02:05.869> pump<00:02:06.200> so<00:02:07.190> as<00:02:07.429> it<00:02:07.909> does<00:02:08.320> it

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
with the water pump so as it does it

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.350 
with the water pump so as it does it
hits<00:02:09.860> that<00:02:10.039> water<00:02:10.220> pump<00:02:10.429> just<00:02:10.940> like<00:02:11.090> that

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
hits that water pump just like that

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.920 
hits that water pump just like that
these<00:02:12.320> two<00:02:12.620> are<00:02:13.130> into<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:14.269> holes<00:02:14.480> in<00:02:14.840> the

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
these two are into the holes in the

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.680 
these two are into the holes in the
crankshaft<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:15.470> you<00:02:15.920> take<00:02:16.190> one<00:02:16.430> of<00:02:16.459> those

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
crankshaft and you take one of those

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.170 
crankshaft and you take one of those
screws<00:02:17.829> that<00:02:18.829> came<00:02:19.100> off<00:02:19.310> that<00:02:19.519> pulley<00:02:19.880> that

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
screws that came off that pulley that

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.720 
screws that came off that pulley that
was<00:02:20.329> on<00:02:20.570> the<00:02:21.170> water<00:02:21.350> pump<00:02:21.590> and<00:02:21.950> I<00:02:22.400> put<00:02:22.640> it

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
was on the water pump and I put it

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.650 
was on the water pump and I put it
somewhere<00:02:24.250> keep<00:02:25.250> up<00:02:25.400> with<00:02:25.549> tools<00:02:25.790> keep<00:02:26.570> up

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
somewhere keep up with tools keep up

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.539 
somewhere keep up with tools keep up
with<00:02:26.780> your<00:02:26.870> tools<00:02:27.019> and<00:02:27.350> you<00:02:27.890> use<00:02:28.130> this<00:02:28.310> little
