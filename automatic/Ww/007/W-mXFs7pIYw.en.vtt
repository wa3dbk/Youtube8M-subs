00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.070
 the clear hashtag 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.550
 which is posted right here at 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.550
 the test by 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.490
 no 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.450
 for the first said I had got you 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.759
 show how to make a to do list 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.020
 so here all forgetting is a list on 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.060
 which one writes all that one has to do 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.619
 during the day then we check in 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.579
 the small squares next to it allows us 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.469
 not to forget anything 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.600
 so for that you will need a 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:41.520
 board of cardboard and leaves 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.649
 color you use leaves to 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.960
 patterns or just come to paint 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.030
 your cardboard board so I have a 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.860
 collar and the leaves on it I use a 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.330
 red leaf and then I alternate with a 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.799
 white and then an orange when 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.360
 it's done I come to position 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.340
 small clothes pegs his tongs 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.140
 linen will allow to hang our 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.030
 sheet of paper that will serve everyone 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:09.179
 our lists when it's done I come 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:11.549
 just paste them then I take a 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.200
 sheet and I write right away or forget 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:16.739
 so I came out with the colors 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.170
 reds and oranges and then I come 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:24.720
 draw small squares that will serve 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:26.730
 check what I would have done and that's it 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.350
 you just have to write on it 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.810
 everything you have to do during the 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.810
 day so I have to edit a video 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.190
 and then I'll have to answer to 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.190
 comments 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.299

 for the audio and following I simply 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.600
 show you how to make a pot to 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.060

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.800

 to make dots in pink with a felt 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.580
 for the glass and then I come 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.490
