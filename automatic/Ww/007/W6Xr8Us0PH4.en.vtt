the<00:02:07.320> army<00:02:07.829> little<00:02:08.039> handle<00:02:10.129> but<00:02:11.129> i<00:02:11.190> thought

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
the army little handle but i thought

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.640 
the army little handle but i thought
that<00:02:11.610> was<00:02:11.670> really<00:02:12.000> cute

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
that was really cute

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.869 
that was really cute
the<00:02:12.860> way<00:02:13.040> it<00:02:13.189> looks<00:02:13.430> like<00:02:13.640> a<00:02:13.670> little<00:02:13.909> handbag

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
the way it looks like a little handbag

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:19.240 
the way it looks like a little handbag
so<00:02:16.879> then<00:02:17.120> I<00:02:17.420> started<00:02:17.860> thinking<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:19.069> I<00:02:19.159> was

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
so then I started thinking and I was

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.100 
so then I started thinking and I was
like<00:02:19.400> let<00:02:19.610> me<00:02:19.640> try<00:02:19.939> making<00:02:20.510> one<00:02:20.540> with

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
like let me try making one with

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.979 
like let me try making one with
chipboard<00:02:21.620> instead<00:02:22.489> of<00:02:22.610> all<00:02:22.849> cardstock<00:02:23.689> and

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
chipboard instead of all cardstock and

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.679 
chipboard instead of all cardstock and
this<00:02:24.950> is<00:02:25.129> what<00:02:25.310> I<00:02:25.340> came<00:02:25.459> up<00:02:25.670> with<00:02:26.769> and<00:02:28.390> this<00:02:29.390> one

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:29.689 
this is what I came up with and this one
