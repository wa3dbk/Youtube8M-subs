rising damp occurs for two reasons both

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.139 
rising damp occurs for two reasons both
based<00:00:37.110> on<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.950> idea<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.280> capillarity<00:00:38.879> and

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
based on the idea of capillarity and

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.139 
based on the idea of capillarity and
capillarity<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.899> simply<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.440> fact<00:00:40.950> that

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
capillarity is simply the fact that

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:43.250 
capillarity is simply the fact that
moisture<00:00:42.149> will<00:00:42.300> tend<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.690> move<00:00:42.930> through

out<00:02:11.160> of<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.340> 18<00:02:11.670> houses<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.210> have<00:02:12.420> mold<00:02:12.660> 50

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
out of the 18 houses that have mold 50

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.510 
out of the 18 houses that have mold 50
and<00:02:13.290> were<00:02:13.380> found<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:13.710> have<00:02:13.740> molds<00:02:14.280> that<00:02:14.340> were

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
and were found to have molds that were

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:24.370 
and were found to have molds that were
highly<00:02:14.850> toxic<00:02:22.160> so<00:02:23.160> what<00:02:23.340> you<00:02:23.430> see<00:02:23.670> when<00:02:23.880> a

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
highly toxic so what you see when a

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.540 
highly toxic so what you see when a
conventional<00:02:25.380> foundation<00:02:25.980> footing<00:02:26.400> is

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
conventional foundation footing is

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.430 
conventional foundation footing is
poured<00:02:26.880> is<00:02:27.180> that<00:02:27.450> it's<00:02:27.600> poured<00:02:27.870> directly<00:02:27.990> on

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
poured is that it's poured directly on

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.710 
poured is that it's poured directly on
the<00:02:28.560> ground<00:02:28.740> and<00:02:29.100> of<00:02:30.030> course<00:02:30.300> it's<00:02:30.480> usually

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
the ground and of course it's usually

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.860 
the ground and of course it's usually
formed<00:02:31.200> with<00:02:31.350> with<00:02:32.040> framing<00:02:32.310> lumber<00:02:32.870> and

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
formed with with framing lumber and

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.710 
formed with with framing lumber and
those<00:02:34.800> do<00:02:35.220> not<00:02:35.370> protect<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:35.970> concrete<00:02:36.450> at<00:02:36.570> all

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
those do not protect the concrete at all

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.949 
those do not protect the concrete at all
from<00:02:37.080> any<00:02:37.290> moisture<00:02:37.770> that<00:02:37.800> may<00:02:38.630> occur<00:02:39.630> around

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
from any moisture that may occur around

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.850 
from any moisture that may occur around
the<00:02:40.200> footing<00:02:41.330> so<00:02:42.330> typically<00:02:42.840> here<00:02:43.110> in<00:02:43.290> in

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
the footing so typically here in in

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.250 
the footing so typically here in in
North<00:02:44.130> America<00:02:44.700> we<00:02:45.390> use<00:02:45.540> some<00:02:45.810> kind<00:02:45.990> of<00:02:46.050> damp

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
North America we use some kind of damp

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.130 
North America we use some kind of damp
proofing<00:02:46.620> on<00:02:46.770> the<00:02:46.890> outside<00:02:47.340> of<00:02:47.520> the<00:02:48.140> concrete

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
proofing on the outside of the concrete

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.170 
proofing on the outside of the concrete
wall<00:02:49.350> and<00:02:49.590> then<00:02:50.340> there<00:02:50.459> will<00:02:50.550> be<00:02:50.610> a<00:02:50.730> moisture

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
wall and then there will be a moisture

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.600 
wall and then there will be a moisture
barrier<00:02:51.330> underneath<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.170> slab<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:52.890> then<00:02:53.430> of

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
barrier underneath the slab and then of

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.430 
barrier underneath the slab and then of
course<00:02:53.640> we<00:02:54.090> often<00:02:54.420> have<00:02:54.570> or<00:02:54.840> we<00:02:54.959> always<00:02:55.230> use<00:02:55.410> a

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
course we often have or we always use a

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.340 
course we often have or we always use a
drain<00:02:55.740> tile<00:02:56.209> at<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.480> base<00:02:57.780> of<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:58.080> footing

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
drain tile at the base of the footing

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.240 
drain tile at the base of the footing
that's<00:02:58.890> buried<00:02:59.310> in<00:02:59.459> a<00:02:59.550> granular<00:02:59.970> fill<00:03:01.250> yeah

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
that's buried in a granular fill yeah

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.530 
that's buried in a granular fill yeah
when<00:03:02.459> you<00:03:02.550> think<00:03:02.760> about<00:03:02.820> it<00:03:03.060> this<00:03:03.150> is<00:03:03.300> kind<00:03:03.510> of

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
when you think about it this is kind of

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.030 
when you think about it this is kind of
crazy<00:03:03.750> it<00:03:04.020> really<00:03:04.230> doesn't<00:03:04.530> make<00:03:04.650> any<00:03:04.800> sense

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
crazy it really doesn't make any sense

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.010 
crazy it really doesn't make any sense
does<00:03:05.370> it<00:03:05.400> because<00:03:05.730> what<00:03:05.880> we<00:03:06.000> do<00:03:06.150> is<00:03:06.390> we<00:03:06.540> do<00:03:06.990> a

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
does it because what we do is we do a

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.530 
does it because what we do is we do a
good<00:03:07.260> job<00:03:07.500> of<00:03:07.709> protecting<00:03:08.550> the<00:03:08.880> the<00:03:09.150> outside

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
good job of protecting the the outside

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.210 
good job of protecting the the outside
face<00:03:09.780> of<00:03:09.990> the<00:03:10.050> wall<00:03:10.230> for<00:03:10.440> moisture<00:03:10.890> we<00:03:11.040> put<00:03:11.190> a

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
face of the wall for moisture we put a

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.340 
face of the wall for moisture we put a
moisture<00:03:11.580> barrier<00:03:11.760> into<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.239> slab<00:03:12.510> then<00:03:13.230> we

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
moisture barrier into the slab then we

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.280 
moisture barrier into the slab then we
channel<00:03:13.800> all<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.190> water<00:03:14.430> down<00:03:15.390> to<00:03:15.720> the

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
channel all the water down to the

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.650 
channel all the water down to the
footing<00:03:16.620> area<00:03:16.980> which<00:03:17.700> we<00:03:17.850> haven't<00:03:18.060> protected

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
footing area which we haven't protected

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.080 
footing area which we haven't protected
in<00:03:18.750> any<00:03:18.900> way<00:03:19.110> and<00:03:19.410> we<00:03:19.440> just<00:03:20.370> ensure<00:03:20.730> that<00:03:20.760> it's

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
in any way and we just ensure that it's

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.560 
in any way and we just ensure that it's
well<00:03:21.330> bits<00:03:22.019> well<00:03:22.200> submerged<00:03:22.830> in<00:03:22.980> water<00:03:23.010> and

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
well bits well submerged in water and

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.970 
well bits well submerged in water and
will<00:03:24.570> lead<00:03:24.750> to<00:03:24.900> rising<00:03:25.080> down<00:03:25.500> coming<00:03:25.860> up

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
will lead to rising down coming up

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.300 
will lead to rising down coming up
through<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.250> footing<00:03:28.010> there's<00:03:29.010> a<00:03:29.070> product

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
through the footing there's a product

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.820 
through the footing there's a product
called<00:03:29.459> former<00:03:30.120> drain<00:03:30.330> and<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:31.440> idea<00:03:31.739> of

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
called former drain and the idea of

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.710 
called former drain and the idea of
former<00:03:32.130> drain<00:03:32.370> is<00:03:32.580> that<00:03:32.760> it<00:03:32.850> actually<00:03:33.000> forms

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
former drain is that it actually forms

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.320 
former drain is that it actually forms
the<00:03:34.040> formwork<00:03:35.040> on<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.430> side<00:03:35.700> of<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:35.940> footings

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
the formwork on the side of the footings

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.900 
the formwork on the side of the footings
and<00:03:36.540> also<00:03:37.500> ultimately<00:03:37.830> provides<00:03:38.400> drainage

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
and also ultimately provides drainage

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.870 
and also ultimately provides drainage
there<00:03:39.810> is<00:03:40.049> an<00:03:40.350> area<00:03:40.920> footing<00:03:41.280> which<00:03:41.400> is<00:03:41.580> below

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
there is an area footing which is below

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.509 
there is an area footing which is below
the<00:03:41.910> form<00:03:42.360> and<00:03:42.769> my<00:03:43.769> question<00:03:44.130> is<00:03:44.190> how<00:03:44.250> does

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
the form and my question is how does

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.220 
the form and my question is how does
that<00:03:44.640> area<00:03:44.970> get<00:03:45.180> drained<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.750> other<00:03:45.870> question

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
that area get drained the other question

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.080 
that area get drained the other question
I<00:03:46.320> have<00:03:46.530> is<00:03:46.560> because<00:03:47.100> the<00:03:47.250> former<00:03:47.580> drain<00:03:47.820> is

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
I have is because the former drain is

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.289 
I have is because the former drain is
actually<00:03:48.980> the<00:03:49.980> sides<00:03:50.250> of<00:03:50.489> the<00:03:50.549> formwork<00:03:50.880> and

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
actually the sides of the formwork and

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.710 
actually the sides of the formwork and
has<00:03:51.570> to<00:03:51.720> provide<00:03:52.019> a<00:03:52.049> screed<00:03:52.530> surface<00:03:53.600> for<00:03:54.600> the

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
has to provide a screed surface for the

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.990 
has to provide a screed surface for the
top<00:03:54.930> of<00:03:55.080> the<00:03:55.170> footing<00:03:55.500> it<00:03:56.430> will<00:03:56.610> have<00:03:56.790> to<00:03:56.910> be

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
top of the footing it will have to be

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.940 
top of the footing it will have to be
level<00:03:57.209> which<00:03:57.690> means<00:03:57.930> of<00:03:58.110> course<00:03:58.140> it<00:03:58.470> can't<00:03:58.769> to

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
level which means of course it can't to

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.289 
level which means of course it can't to
promote<00:03:59.190> drainage<00:03:59.760> because<00:03:59.910> there's<00:04:00.180> no

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
promote drainage because there's no

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:03.880 
promote drainage because there's no
slope<00:04:00.630> to<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:01.250> to<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.340> former<00:04:02.640> drain<00:04:02.850> itself

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
slope to the to the former drain itself

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.400 
slope to the to the former drain itself
so<00:04:04.890> what<00:04:05.040> do<00:04:05.100> we<00:04:05.190> do<00:04:05.340> to<00:04:05.459> control<00:04:06.230> rising<00:04:07.230> down

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
so what do we do to control rising down

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.710 
so what do we do to control rising down
well<00:04:07.860> the<00:04:08.130> first<00:04:08.340> thing<00:04:08.489> we<00:04:08.580> do<00:04:08.730> is<00:04:08.880> we<00:04:09.030> we

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
well the first thing we do is we we

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.110 
well the first thing we do is we we
excavate<00:04:10.260> with<00:04:10.530> a<00:04:10.560> slight<00:04:10.830> slope<00:04:11.130> so<00:04:11.760> we<00:04:11.910> can

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
excavate with a slight slope so we can

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.990 
excavate with a slight slope so we can
help<00:04:12.720> ensure<00:04:12.870> drainage<00:04:13.470> we<00:04:14.250> put<00:04:14.489> the<00:04:14.610> footing

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
help ensure drainage we put the footing

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.360 
help ensure drainage we put the footing
and<00:04:15.239> the<00:04:15.299> slab<00:04:15.750> on<00:04:16.080> a<00:04:16.140> four<00:04:16.530> inch<00:04:16.680> compacted

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
and the slab on a four inch compacted

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.370 
and the slab on a four inch compacted
gravel<00:04:17.400> fill<00:04:17.970> so

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
gravel fill so

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.710 
gravel fill so
to<00:04:18.440> get<00:04:18.590> good<00:04:18.800> drainage<00:04:18.950> in<00:04:19.400> that<00:04:19.550> area<00:04:19.850> we

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
to get good drainage in that area we

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.240 
to get good drainage in that area we
install<00:04:21.110> drain<00:04:21.440> tile<00:04:21.680> so<00:04:21.980> it's<00:04:22.100> actually

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
install drain tile so it's actually

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.030 
install drain tile so it's actually
slightly<00:04:22.700> below<00:04:23.060> the<00:04:23.720> bottom<00:04:24.050> of<00:04:24.200> the<00:04:24.350> footing

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
slightly below the bottom of the footing

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.000 
slightly below the bottom of the footing
and<00:04:25.220> this<00:04:25.760> way<00:04:25.970> we<00:04:26.900> ensure<00:04:27.050> that<00:04:27.290> we<00:04:27.770> don't

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
and this way we ensure that we don't

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.920 
and this way we ensure that we don't
have<00:04:28.130> to<00:04:28.310> have<00:04:28.430> water<00:04:28.610> and<00:04:29.240> build<00:04:29.510> up<00:04:29.750> around

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
have to have water and build up around

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.770 
have to have water and build up around
the<00:04:30.200> footing<00:04:30.560> and<00:04:31.030> lastly<00:04:32.030> what<00:04:32.270> we<00:04:32.300> do<00:04:32.480> is<00:04:32.630> we

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
the footing and lastly what we do is we

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.140 
the footing and lastly what we do is we
use<00:04:32.990> a<00:04:33.020> material<00:04:33.650> like<00:04:34.220> the<00:04:34.610> fast<00:04:34.880> foot

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
use a material like the fast foot

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.330 
use a material like the fast foot
product<00:04:35.630> which<00:04:36.350> will<00:04:36.500> provide<00:04:36.800> a<00:04:36.860> capillary

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
product which will provide a capillary

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.100 
product which will provide a capillary
break<00:04:37.700> around<00:04:38.030> the<00:04:38.210> footing<00:04:38.570> and<00:04:38.750> prevent

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
break around the footing and prevent

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:51.570 
break around the footing and prevent
water<00:04:39.290> from<00:04:39.440> entering<00:04:39.890> the<00:04:40.520> concrete

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.639
