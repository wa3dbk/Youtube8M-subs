00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:19.230
 eat my name is niels and i am jasper 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.820
 and I want to tell you about my 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.070
 minecraft server 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.480
 the the new the icare server two point 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.810
 zero shall we say 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.250
 well no it's two point zero to 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.989
 down on complications 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.989
 so maybe so many 2 pin hedgehogs around 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.309
 the server that starts at half past seven 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.770
 open it is still a faction 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.440
 server and it is of course one deep 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.780
 description and 40 man server 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.970
 all welcome to come into play 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.230
 the one that is full then you have to get lost 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.580
 no that we are also upstairs but that must be 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.410
 of course you have to wait that place 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:57.300
 is of course whole 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.550
 have faith in you i believe i believe 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.110
 in it 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.850
 So naturally after playing command up 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.430
 may start inch version 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.869
 versions of fresh world fresh everything i 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.040
 I think I just order in the world yet 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.590
 good bet for me 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.340
 I should n't know that would be delicious 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.109
 clumsy old Shir his narrative so 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.270
 if you ask oh from school too 

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:20.759
 have that goes out 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.969
 of course unfortunately, but what use 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.969
 has 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.539
 if you have two servers we have a little 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.950
 one of 10 people and the other 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:32.210
 for 40 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.210
 this style is also in 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.060
 Then it is together with this one 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.460
 by the way also in a point 6 point 2 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.280
 therefore that is why it took so long 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.600
 So yes then you know that now again 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.610
 yes it takes a nasty thing I could not help it 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.649
 do you have it like that even though 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.259
 marked per good blue the server enters 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.570

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:57.200
