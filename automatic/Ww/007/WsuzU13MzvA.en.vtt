wats<00:01:55.009> so<00:01:56.009> that's<00:01:56.450> 26<00:01:57.450> watts<00:01:57.719> total<00:01:57.990> on<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.290> top

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
wats so that's 26 watts total on the top

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.109 
wats so that's 26 watts total on the top
of<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.950> 10th<00:01:59.189> you<00:01:59.369> can<00:01:59.520> kind<00:01:59.729> of<00:01:59.790> see<00:01:59.850> what<00:02:00.060> it

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
of the 10th you can kind of see what it

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.840 
of the 10th you can kind of see what it
looks<00:02:00.270> like<00:02:00.420> right<00:02:00.479> there<00:02:01.070> on<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.130> reflection

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
looks like right there on the reflection

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.300 
looks like right there on the reflection
and<00:02:03.770> these<00:02:04.770> are<00:02:04.920> actually<00:02:05.130> doing<00:02:05.219> really

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
and these are actually doing really

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.429 
and these are actually doing really
really<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:06.240> good<00:02:06.450> job<00:02:06.750> better<00:02:07.049> than<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.320> other

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
really a good job better than the other

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.850 
really a good job better than the other
light<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.190> had<00:02:08.280> on<00:02:08.640> there<00:02:08.819> earlier<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.739> I'm<00:02:10.739> not

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
light I had on there earlier and I'm not

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.530 
light I had on there earlier and I'm not
sure<00:02:10.979> if<00:02:11.039> you<00:02:11.099> can<00:02:11.190> see<00:02:11.250> or<00:02:11.580> not<00:02:11.730> but<00:02:12.000> they've

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
sure if you can see or not but they've

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.820 
sure if you can see or not but they've
got<00:02:12.569> really<00:02:12.989> good<00:02:13.170> metal

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
got really good metal

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.370 
got really good metal
reflectors<00:02:14.370> that<00:02:14.640> focus<00:02:15.450> a<00:02:15.600> lot<00:02:15.870> of<00:02:16.140> light

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
reflectors that focus a lot of light

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.070 
reflectors that focus a lot of light
down<00:02:16.620> into<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.100> tank<00:02:17.370> so<00:02:18.330> if<00:02:18.450> you<00:02:18.570> know<00:02:18.690> from<00:02:18.960> a

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
down into the tank so if you know from a

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.470 
down into the tank so if you know from a
top<00:02:19.830> perspective<00:02:20.070> you<00:02:20.460> can<00:02:20.550> see<00:02:20.730> how<00:02:20.910> wide<00:02:21.180> the

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
top perspective you can see how wide the

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.330 
top perspective you can see how wide the
plants<00:02:21.840> are<00:02:21.900> opened<00:02:22.260> up<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:22.740> how<00:02:22.920> much<00:02:23.040> lights

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
plants are opened up and how much lights

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.080 
plants are opened up and how much lights
getting<00:02:23.610> down<00:02:23.850> to<00:02:23.880> them<00:02:24.740> so<00:02:25.970> really<00:02:26.970> really

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
getting down to them so really really

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.480 
getting down to them so really really
good<00:02:27.420> option<00:02:27.810> for<00:02:27.840> nano<00:02:28.320> planted<00:02:28.710> tanks<00:02:29.100> they

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
good option for nano planted tanks they

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.640 
good option for nano planted tanks they
look<00:02:29.700> really<00:02:30.000> really<00:02:30.240> good<00:02:30.330> on<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.570> cube<00:02:30.990> and

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
look really really good on a cube and

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.070 
look really really good on a cube and
they're<00:02:32.220> actually<00:02:32.520> really<00:02:32.550> cheap<00:02:33.090> i<00:02:33.330> think<00:02:33.990> i

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
they're actually really cheap i think i

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.400 
they're actually really cheap i think i
paid<00:02:34.320> twenty<00:02:34.920> dollars<00:02:35.220> apiece<00:02:35.520> for<00:02:35.790> them<00:02:35.910> so

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
paid twenty dollars apiece for them so

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.170 
paid twenty dollars apiece for them so
40<00:02:37.410> bucks<00:02:37.590> is<00:02:37.740> not<00:02:37.890> a<00:02:37.920> real<00:02:38.220> big<00:02:38.490> investment

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
40 bucks is not a real big investment

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.110 
40 bucks is not a real big investment
and<00:02:39.300> they<00:02:39.390> do<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.600> really<00:02:39.930> good<00:02:40.320> job<00:02:40.350> of<00:02:41.120> growing

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
and they do a really good job of growing

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.240 
and they do a really good job of growing
the<00:02:42.210> plants<00:02:42.420> so<00:02:43.050> really<00:02:43.440> really<00:02:43.770> happy<00:02:43.980> with

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
the plants so really really happy with

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.920 
the plants so really really happy with
the<00:02:44.430> quality<00:02:45.180> of<00:02:45.480> these<00:02:45.690> lights<00:02:45.990> so<00:02:46.260> far<00:02:46.500> and

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
the quality of these lights so far and

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.190 
the quality of these lights so far and
yeah<00:02:48.930> so<00:02:49.290> that's<00:02:49.590> what<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.480> 8<00:02:51.480> gallon<00:02:51.930> evolve

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
yeah so that's what the 8 gallon evolve

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.860 
yeah so that's what the 8 gallon evolve
tanks<00:02:52.590> looking<00:02:52.860> like<00:02:53.240> overall<00:02:54.240> very<00:02:54.480> very

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
tanks looking like overall very very

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.010 
tanks looking like overall very very
good<00:02:56.000> I'm<00:02:57.000> still<00:02:57.270> kind<00:02:57.480> of<00:02:57.540> twine<00:02:57.780> with<00:02:57.930> the

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
good I'm still kind of twine with the

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.550 
good I'm still kind of twine with the
idea<00:02:58.320> of<00:02:58.850> moving<00:02:59.850> the<00:03:00.690> beta<00:03:00.959> into<00:03:01.290> different

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
idea of moving the beta into different

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.800 
idea of moving the beta into different
tanka<00:03:01.890> I<00:03:02.040> I<00:03:02.250> really<00:03:02.880> really<00:03:03.270> wanted<00:03:03.480> to<00:03:03.600> try

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
tanka I I really really wanted to try

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.650 
tanka I I really really wanted to try
out<00:03:03.959> some<00:03:04.170> celestial<00:03:04.650> pearl<00:03:04.890> danios<00:03:05.400> I<00:03:05.700> keep

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
out some celestial pearl danios I keep

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:07.760 
out some celestial pearl danios I keep
seeing<00:03:06.780> other<00:03:06.990> people<00:03:07.230> on<00:03:07.290> YouTube<00:03:07.590> posting

videos of them and I don't know i might

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.180 
videos of them and I don't know i might
break<00:03:11.850> down<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.330> go<00:03:12.420> get<00:03:12.660> some<00:03:12.959> i<00:03:13.200> saw<00:03:13.620> a<00:03:13.650> local

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
break down and go get some i saw a local

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.130 
break down and go get some i saw a local
store<00:03:14.580> that<00:03:14.700> has<00:03:14.790> them<00:03:14.940> for<00:03:15.030> like<00:03:15.150> icon

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
store that has them for like icon

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.440 
store that has them for like icon
something<00:03:16.640> expensive<00:03:17.640> in<00:03:17.880> my<00:03:17.970> opinion<00:03:18.269> like

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
something expensive in my opinion like

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.600 
something expensive in my opinion like
eight<00:03:18.690> bucks<00:03:18.930> of<00:03:19.200> fish<00:03:19.380> so<00:03:20.370> I<00:03:20.400> think<00:03:20.489> that's

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
eight bucks of fish so I think that's

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.009 
eight bucks of fish so I think that's
kind<00:03:20.790> of<00:03:20.820> expensive<00:03:21.000> for<00:03:21.360> such<00:03:21.510> small<00:03:21.750> fish

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
kind of expensive for such small fish

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.199 
kind of expensive for such small fish
but<00:03:22.320> might<00:03:23.040> just<00:03:23.400> have<00:03:23.610> to<00:03:23.640> go<00:03:23.880> get<00:03:24.060> some<00:03:24.590> but

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
but might just have to go get some but

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.430 
but might just have to go get some but
anyways<00:03:27.209> that's<00:03:27.450> all<00:03:27.600> I<00:03:27.630> got<00:03:27.870> just<00:03:28.170> wanted<00:03:28.380> to

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
show you a video of the other nano tank

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.170 
show you a video of the other nano tank
and<00:03:31.250> once<00:03:32.250> again<00:03:32.400> thanks<00:03:32.760> for<00:03:32.820> watching<00:03:32.910> guys
