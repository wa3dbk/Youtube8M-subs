consultations but actually it was a
short<00:00:38.250> list<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.660> things<00:00:39.690> that<00:00:39.960> really

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
short list of the things that really

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.010 
matter to you and just sort of an aide
memoire<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.329> things<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.660> remember<00:00:42.870> when

you're<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.440> consultation<00:00:43.800> I<00:00:44.250> actually

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
you're in the consultation I actually

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.069 
you're in the consultation I actually
think<00:00:44.730> it's<00:00:44.940> really<00:00:45.149> useful<00:00:45.329> as<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.719> doctor<00:00:46.050> I

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
think it's really useful as a doctor I

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.680 
think it's really useful as a doctor I
never<00:00:46.379> mind<00:00:46.620> patients<00:00:47.070> who<00:00:47.129> bring<00:00:47.450> short<00:00:48.450> list

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
never mind patients who bring short list

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.150 
never mind patients who bring short list
if<00:00:48.870> they<00:00:48.960> bring<00:00:49.110> long<00:00:49.320> less<00:00:49.590> often<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:50.039> have

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
if they bring long less often you have

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.529 
if they bring long less often you have
to<00:00:50.280> say<00:00:50.399> look<00:00:50.640> these<00:00:50.820> are<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.090> things<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.510> I

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
to say look these are the things that I

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.810 
to say look these are the things that I
can<00:00:51.780> deal<00:00:51.989> with<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.320> this<00:00:52.410> consultation<00:00:52.829> these

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
can deal with in this consultation these

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.189 
can deal with in this consultation these
are<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.000> things<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.270> think<00:00:54.480> in<00:00:54.539> most<00:00:54.629> important

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
are the things I think in most important

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.840 
are the things I think in most important
if<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.379> agreed<00:00:55.680> about<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.489> then<00:00:56.730> the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
if you agreed about that and then the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.279 
if you agreed about that and then the
rest<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.239> things<00:00:57.360> on<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.600> list<00:00:57.690> have<00:00:58.140> to

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
rest of the things on the list have to

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.500 
rest of the things on the list have to
be<00:00:58.489> handed<00:00:59.489> over<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.789> another<00:01:00.059> consultation

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
be handed over to another consultation

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.830 
be handed over to another consultation
so<00:01:01.140> bringing<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.649> list<00:01:01.829> along<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.219> good<00:01:02.399> thing

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
so bringing a list along is a good thing

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.359 
so bringing a list along is a good thing
making<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:04.049> list<00:01:04.229> making<00:01:04.530> notes<00:01:04.890> during<00:01:05.189> the

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
making a list making notes during the

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.120 
making a list making notes during the
consultation<00:01:05.700> isn't<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.420> bad<00:01:06.600> idea<00:01:06.780> either<00:01:07.130> so

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
consultation isn't a bad idea either so

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.530 
consultation isn't a bad idea either so
you've<00:01:08.250> got<00:01:08.280> some<00:01:08.400> sort<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.820> record<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.390> what

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
goes on during the consultation some

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.520 
goes on during the consultation some
rather<00:01:12.119> forward-thinking<00:01:12.659> doctors<00:01:13.350> will

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
rather forward-thinking doctors will

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.660

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
know what the likely outcome is but take

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.790 
know what the likely outcome is but take
you<00:02:35.270> for<00:02:35.420> surgery<00:02:35.630> that<00:02:35.930> has<00:02:36.020> major<00:02:36.320> outcomes

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
you for surgery that has major outcomes

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.410 
you for surgery that has major outcomes
like<00:02:36.980> heart<00:02:37.220> surgery<00:02:37.310> you<00:02:37.850> should<00:02:38.060> be<00:02:38.180> able<00:02:38.270> to

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
like heart surgery you should be able to

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.810 
like heart surgery you should be able to
ask<00:02:38.650> how<00:02:39.650> many<00:02:39.709> of<00:02:39.920> these<00:02:39.980> have<00:02:40.040> you<00:02:40.190> done<00:02:40.490> what

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
ask how many of these have you done what

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.699 
ask how many of these have you done what
sort<00:02:41.060> of<00:02:41.090> results<00:02:41.450> do<00:02:41.540> you<00:02:41.630> get<00:02:41.870> how<00:02:42.530> do<00:02:42.590> you

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
sort of results do you get how do you

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.920 
sort of results do you get how do you
compare<00:02:43.070> to<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.250> national<00:02:43.280> average<00:02:43.930> how

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
compare to the national average how

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.600 
compare to the national average how
likely<00:02:45.260> is<00:02:45.500> it<00:02:45.530> that<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:45.830> surgery<00:02:46.130> will<00:02:46.340> harm

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
quite a tricky clinical decision there's

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.870 
quite a tricky clinical decision there's
some<00:04:54.530> evidence<00:04:54.680> suggests<00:04:55.099> it<00:04:55.430> might<00:04:55.580> possibly

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
some evidence suggests it might possibly

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.520 
some evidence suggests it might possibly

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
increase the risk of breast cancer but

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.409 
increase the risk of breast cancer but
it<00:04:57.620> might<00:04:57.800> reduce<00:04:58.070> your<00:04:58.280> hot<00:04:58.370> flushes<00:04:58.669> what
