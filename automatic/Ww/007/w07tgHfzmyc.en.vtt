00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
ever really get a good view of the back

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.650 
ever really get a good view of the back
here<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.860> looked<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.460> me<00:00:38.700> like<00:00:39.000> there<00:00:39.540> were<00:00:39.629> two

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
here it looked to me like there were two

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.139 
here it looked to me like there were two
blue<00:00:40.170> bits<00:00:40.469> in<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.860> middle<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.579> space<00:00:41.940> in

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
blue bits in the middle the space in

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.049 
blue bits in the middle the space in
between<00:00:42.180> like<00:00:42.660> this<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.410> then<00:00:44.250> -<00:00:45.140> not<00:00:46.140> that

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
between like this and then - not that

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.020 
between like this and then - not that
angled<00:00:48.379> blue<00:00:49.379> bits<00:00:49.620> on<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.860> side<00:00:50.100> that's

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
angled blue bits on the side that's

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.029 
angled blue bits on the side that's
that's<00:00:51.600> what<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:51.780> got<00:00:52.110> out<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.590> um<00:00:54.710> now<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.739> do

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
that's what I got out of it um now I do

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.760 
that's what I got out of it um now I do
think<00:00:56.520> this<00:00:56.730> worked<00:00:57.270> out<00:00:57.449> very<00:00:57.510> well<00:00:58.020> for<00:00:58.289> its

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
think this worked out very well for its

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.590 
think this worked out very well for its
size<00:00:59.039> though<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.550> do<00:00:59.699> think<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.329> could<00:01:00.480> have

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
size though I do think it could have

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.920 
size though I do think it could have
been<00:01:00.719> better<00:01:02.120> the<00:01:03.120> wings<00:01:03.390> for<00:01:04.170> instance<00:01:04.949> are

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
been better the wings for instance are

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.649 
been better the wings for instance are
fairly<00:01:06.930> large<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:08.220> mean<00:01:08.250> they're<00:01:08.700> far<00:01:09.390> larger

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
fairly large I mean they're far larger

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.010 
fairly large I mean they're far larger
than<00:01:10.010> the<00:01:11.030> game<00:01:12.030> or<00:01:12.450> views<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.650> have<00:01:13.890> seen

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
than the game or views that I have seen

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.460 
than the game or views that I have seen
where<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.049> looks<00:01:16.380> like<00:01:17.030> now<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.060> am<00:01:18.390> rambling<00:01:19.170> a

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
where it looks like now I am rambling a

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.260 
where it looks like now I am rambling a
lot<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:20.040> this<00:01:21.200> cuz<00:01:22.340> the<00:01:23.340> real<00:01:23.520> truth<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:24.119> this

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
lot of this cuz the real truth of this

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.440

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
just like the Starscream I had before

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.740

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.040 

next<00:03:12.140> you<00:03:12.290> can<00:03:12.700> bring<00:03:13.700> out<00:03:13.880> his<00:03:14.090> arms<00:03:14.720> a<00:03:14.900> little

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:28.600 
bit and flip up his head now personally
I<00:03:23.260> really<00:03:24.260> like<00:03:25.930> Starscream<00:03:26.930> in<00:03:27.310> this<00:03:28.310> mode

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
I really like Starscream in this mode

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.510 
I really like Starscream in this mode
and<00:03:28.820> in<00:03:29.180> his<00:03:29.630> robot<00:03:30.050> mode<00:03:30.080> but<00:03:30.560> since<00:03:30.830> I<00:03:31.040> own

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
and in his robot mode but since I own

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.510 
and in his robot mode but since I own
neither<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:32.480> game<00:03:32.720> nor<00:03:33.320> the<00:03:33.620> toy<00:03:33.890> I<00:03:34.220> don't

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
neither the game nor the toy I don't

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.650 
neither the game nor the toy I don't
know<00:03:34.880> how<00:03:35.210> accurate<00:03:36.160> this<00:03:37.160> is<00:03:37.460> he<00:03:38.120> has<00:03:38.330> blue

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
know how accurate this is he has blue

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.480 
know how accurate this is he has blue
right<00:03:38.900> here<00:03:38.930> these<00:03:39.560> should<00:03:39.980> have<00:03:40.130> flipped

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
right here these should have flipped

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.070 
right here these should have flipped
back<00:03:40.820> I<00:03:40.850> assume<00:03:43.420> this<00:03:44.420> whoops

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
back I assume this whoops

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.620 
back I assume this whoops
err<00:03:45.440> one<00:03:45.710> yeah<00:03:46.220> he's<00:03:46.460> really<00:03:46.700> back<00:03:47.000> heavy<00:03:47.450> and

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
err one yeah he's really back heavy and

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.580 
err one yeah he's really back heavy and
unlike<00:03:48.280> g1<00:03:49.280> he<00:03:49.430> doesn't<00:03:49.790> have<00:03:49.910> those<00:03:50.120> large

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
unlike g1 he doesn't have those large

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.770 
unlike g1 he doesn't have those large
fins<00:03:51.590> coming<00:03:52.130> down<00:03:52.400> to<00:03:52.610> stabilize<00:03:53.120> him<00:03:55.660> so<00:03:56.660> he

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
fins coming down to stabilize him so he

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.290 
fins coming down to stabilize him so he
can't<00:03:57.020> fall<00:03:57.230> over<00:03:57.620> you<00:03:58.460> don't<00:03:58.640> have<00:03:58.850> him<00:03:59.030> set

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
can't fall over you don't have him set

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.140 
can't fall over you don't have him set
up<00:03:59.330> right<00:03:59.770> now<00:04:00.770> what<00:04:00.920> I<00:04:00.950> saw<00:04:01.250> he<00:04:01.520> has<00:04:01.640> red
