00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.970
 In this video I'll show you how 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.730
 create a second partition on your disk 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.820
 hard using a tool that 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.330
 is included in windows 7 and also in 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.330
 windows vista 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:22.870
 this step is important especially if it goes 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.870
 to protect your system with pixelated garde 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:32.110
 let's go to the start menu and let's do 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:36.690
 one click with the right button on the computer and 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.690
 we are going to select administer 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.630
 the administration window of 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.470
 teams on the left side 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:54.710
 we select record management 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:58.100
 the computer will show us the disk 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:01.460
 hard that we have and the partition that 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.460
 has in this case is only one is a 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.120
 small disk of 40 days we click 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:11.940
 as the right button 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.940
 and we choose to reduce the volume 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:21.970
 windows 7 analyzes the partition that has 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.220
 and decide what is the optimum size that 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.770
 you need the operating system to 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.290
 work and how much space is available 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.860
 can leave free for the second 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.860
 partition 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:40.219
 this process takes time depending on the 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:43.789
 size of the disk you have is important 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:45.710
 do not interrupt this process until the 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:48.429
 final screen with the results 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.429
 appear 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:56.380
 in this window we can see the report 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:59.350
 what windows 7 gives us 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.049
 of the optimal values for the disk 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:07.439
 hard and the new partition we press the 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:07.439
 reduce button to start the process 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.860
 as a result we have a second 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.570
 partition is not assigned so 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.480
 we have to click with the button 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:22.090
 right mouse and select a new 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.830
 simple volume the assistant for new 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:28.130
 volume appears press next 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.140
 we accept the default values 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:34.380
 accept we press next and 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.170
 Next again in this part you 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.780
 you can choose if you want to put a 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.870
 name the partition in this case I do not 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.269
 I'm going to give him no name 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.640
 you have to take into account also that 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:50.180
 must be marked the option that says 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.549
 quickly format this way the 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.600
 formatting the new partition is not going to 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:57.810
 delay so much 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.880
 press end to proceed with 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.230
 all the instructions that we have 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.230
 given to windows 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.349
 once the formatting of the 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:19.340
 new partition will appear with a letter 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:21.260
 assigned in the disk list this 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:25.010
 it means that its second partition 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:27.170
 is ready to be used 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.409
 let's close the administrator 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.629
 teams and we're going to see that the disk that 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:35.209
 is the one that we just created is ready 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:38.930
 for use to check it 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:41.090
 let's go open equipment to see that 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.940
 effectively we have both 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:47.060
 partitions now effectively the cee 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:52.150
 in which we are using and the e that is 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.150
 the new one and it's completely empty 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.209
 I hope this video is of 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:01.090
 utility and in the second part I'm going to 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:04.209
 teach how to redirect files 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.910
 personal to keep them in the 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:09.790
 second partition and separate them from the 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.370
 operating system thank you very much and yes 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:17.040
 have any questions or comments for 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.040
 please let me know thank you
