thing<00:00:41.070> about<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.489> FX<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:41.910> 300<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.020> has

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
thing about the FX is 300 is that it has

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.319 
thing about the FX is 300 is that it has
six<00:00:43.440> cores<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:44.010> when<00:00:44.190> games<00:00:44.430> do<00:00:44.760> start<00:00:45.059> taking

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
six cores so when games do start taking

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.330 
six cores so when games do start taking
advantage<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.809> six<00:00:46.079> core<00:00:46.289> technology<00:00:46.860> which

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
advantage of six core technology which

advantage of six core technology which
they<00:00:47.550> started<00:00:48.030> are<00:00:48.420> starting<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:48.930> look<00:00:49.559> at

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
they started are starting to look at

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.439 
they started are starting to look at
battlefield<00:00:50.160> 4<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.520> actually<00:00:50.850> recommends<00:00:51.390> a

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
battlefield 4 it actually recommends a

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.720 
battlefield 4 it actually recommends a
six<00:00:51.690> core<00:00:51.930> AMD<00:00:52.350> processor<00:00:53.039> this<00:00:53.489> thing's

six core AMD processor this thing's

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.270 
six core AMD processor this thing's
gonna<00:00:53.850> blow<00:00:54.120> those<00:00:54.480> two<00:00:54.719> CPUs<00:00:55.199> away<00:00:55.440> also<00:00:56.100> with

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
gonna blow those two CPUs away also with

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.689 
gonna blow those two CPUs away also with
an<00:00:56.399> i3<00:00:56.610> or<00:00:57.090> an<00:00:57.300> FX<00:00:57.600> 4300<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.379> extremely<00:00:59.280> hard<00:00:59.520> to

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
an i3 or an FX 4300 is extremely hard to

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.610 
an i3 or an FX 4300 is extremely hard to
do<00:00:59.850> live<00:01:00.090> streaming<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.809> video<00:01:01.079> editing<00:01:01.109> and

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
do live streaming and video editing and

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.439 
do live streaming and video editing and
things<00:01:01.800> like<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.010> it's<00:01:02.550> really<00:01:02.820> piss<00:01:03.149> poor

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
things like that it's really piss poor

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.039 
things like that it's really piss poor
on<00:01:03.570> those<00:01:03.750> CPUs<00:01:04.229> but<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.830> FX<00:01:05.159> 6300<00:01:06.049> streaming

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
on those CPUs but the FX 6300 streaming

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.600 
on those CPUs but the FX 6300 streaming
and<00:01:07.260> video<00:01:07.560> editing<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:08.040> actually<00:01:08.400> fairly

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
and video editing is actually fairly

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.149 
and video editing is actually fairly
decent<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.420> mean<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.750> isn't<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.409> best<00:01:10.650> six<00:01:10.920> core

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.160 
decent I mean it isn't the best six core
cpu<00:01:11.549> but<00:01:11.909> it's<00:01:12.060> still<00:01:12.240> six<00:01:12.510> cores<00:01:12.810> nonetheless

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.780 
at 3.5 years and 4.1 bigger it's
terrible<00:01:15.780> just<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.380> really<00:01:16.650> great<00:01:16.799> CPU<00:01:17.100> at<00:01:17.520> the

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
terrible just a really great CPU at the

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.399 
terrible just a really great CPU at the
price<00:01:18.030> range<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.659> can<00:01:18.780> pretty<00:01:18.930> much<00:01:19.020> run

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
price range and it can pretty much run

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.499 
price range and it can pretty much run
any<00:01:19.650> game<00:01:19.950> with<00:01:20.189> uh<00:01:20.220> with<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.759> decent<00:01:21.000> GPU

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
any game with uh with a decent GPU

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.120 
any game with uh with a decent GPU
paired<00:01:21.930> up<00:01:22.080> with<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.439> which<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.710> got<00:01:22.890> in<00:01:23.040> this

these<00:01:37.079> parts<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:37.560> i<00:01:37.590> can<00:01:37.829> spend<00:01:38.100> more<00:01:38.159> money<00:01:38.460> on

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
these parts so i can spend more money on

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.460 
these parts so i can spend more money on
the<00:01:38.850> more<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.570> know<00:01:39.659> important<00:01:40.079> parts<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.409> the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
the more you know important parts of the

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.200 
the more you know important parts of the
build<00:01:40.680> like<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.130> graphics<00:01:41.490> card<00:01:41.880> which<00:01:42.060> is

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
build like the graphics card which is

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.060 
build like the graphics card which is
the<00:01:42.780> most<00:01:42.930> detrimental<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.649> your<00:01:43.799> gaming

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
the most detrimental to your gaming

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.710 
the most detrimental to your gaming
performance<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:44.790> it's<00:01:45.180> still<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.509> great

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
performance so it's still a great

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.420 
performance so it's still a great
motherboard<00:01:46.350> it's<00:01:46.500> from<00:01:46.680> asus<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.280> know

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
motherboard it's from asus so you know

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.130 
motherboard it's from asus so you know
you're<00:01:47.610> getting<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.909> quality<00:01:48.119> product<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.990> it

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
you're getting a quality product and it

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.310 
you're getting a quality product and it
has<00:01:49.320> two<00:01:49.590> ram<00:01:49.799> slots<00:01:50.100> up<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.430> 1866<00:01:51.329> ram<00:01:51.990> and

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
has two ram slots up to 1866 ram and

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.139 
has two ram slots up to 1866 ram and
yeah<00:01:52.770> that's<00:01:52.920> pretty<00:01:53.040> much<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.369> it's<00:01:53.820> just

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
yeah that's pretty much it it's just

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.819 
yeah that's pretty much it it's just
nice<00:01:54.329> it's<00:01:54.509> motherboard<00:01:54.750> for<00:01:54.990> $55<00:01:55.710> no

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
nice it's motherboard for $55 no

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.560 
nice it's motherboard for $55 no
crossfire<00:01:56.310> obviously<00:01:56.759> it's<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:56.939> micro<00:01:57.240> board

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
crossfire obviously it's a micro board

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.600 
crossfire obviously it's a micro board
so<00:01:57.810> you're<00:01:58.350> really<00:01:58.560> not<00:01:58.770> expecting<00:01:59.009> much<00:01:59.430> out

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
so you're really not expecting much out

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.130 
so you're really not expecting much out
of<00:01:59.700> this<00:01:59.969> motherboard<00:02:00.299> but<00:02:00.659> it's<00:02:00.810> gonna<00:02:00.930> get

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
of this motherboard but it's gonna get

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.719 
of this motherboard but it's gonna get
the<00:02:01.259> job<00:02:01.469> done<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.920> that's<00:02:02.070> pretty<00:02:02.399> much<00:02:02.520> all

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
the job done and that's pretty much all

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.630 
the job done and that's pretty much all
you<00:02:02.969> want<00:02:03.240> at<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:03.659> point<00:02:03.750> for<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.740> RAM<00:02:04.950> now<00:02:05.340> I

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
you want at this point for the RAM now I

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.310 
you want at this point for the RAM now I
really<00:02:06.180> wanted<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.420> get<00:02:06.540> eight<00:02:06.750> gigs<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.110> RAM

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
really wanted to get eight gigs of RAM

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.499 
really wanted to get eight gigs of RAM
in<00:02:07.530> this<00:02:07.770> bill<00:02:08.009> but<00:02:08.160> eight<00:02:08.369> gigs<00:02:08.580> of<00:02:08.700> RAM<00:02:08.910> is<00:02:09.149> so

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
in this bill but eight gigs of RAM is so

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.750 
in this bill but eight gigs of RAM is so
expensive<00:02:10.110> like<00:02:10.560> holy<00:02:10.830> crap<00:02:11.220> it's<00:02:11.489> starting

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
expensive like holy crap it's starting

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.059 
expensive like holy crap it's starting
to<00:02:11.819> be<00:02:11.879> telling<00:02:12.120> how<00:02:12.209> hard<00:02:12.480> drives

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
to be telling how hard drives

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.739 
to be telling how hard drives
are<00:02:13.129> about<00:02:13.670> two<00:02:13.879> years<00:02:14.090> ago<00:02:14.239> if<00:02:14.540> you<00:02:14.629> guys

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:14.749 
are about two years ago if you guys

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:16.420 
are about two years ago if you guys
remember<00:02:14.900> when<00:02:15.319> that<00:02:15.349> flood<00:02:15.799> happened<00:02:16.280> and

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
remember when that flood happened and

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.670 
remember when that flood happened and
then<00:02:16.700> hard<00:02:16.909> drive<00:02:17.120> prices<00:02:17.420> just<00:02:17.810> jacked<00:02:18.230> up<00:02:18.499> it

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
then hard drive prices just jacked up it

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.589 
then hard drive prices just jacked up it
was<00:02:18.769> like<00:02:18.829> a<00:02:19.159> hundred<00:02:19.609> dollars<00:02:20.120> for<00:02:20.359> a<00:02:20.389> one

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
was like a hundred dollars for a one

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.360 
was like a hundred dollars for a one
terabyte<00:02:20.810> drive<00:02:21.319> or<00:02:21.709> even<00:02:21.950> more<00:02:22.129> it<00:02:22.249> might

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
terabyte drive or even more it might

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.580 
terabyte drive or even more it might
have<00:02:22.459> been<00:02:22.519> like<00:02:22.670> 150<00:02:23.420> now<00:02:23.870> eight<00:02:24.170> gigabytes

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
have been like 150 now eight gigabytes

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.890 
have been like 150 now eight gigabytes
of<00:02:24.709> RAM<00:02:24.920> is<00:02:25.069> like<00:02:25.209> $85<00:02:26.209> that's<00:02:26.420> just<00:02:26.689> really

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
of RAM is like $85 that's just really

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.509 
of RAM is like $85 that's just really
pricey<00:02:27.290> so<00:02:27.560> I<00:02:27.590> have<00:02:27.799> to<00:02:27.950> go<00:02:28.099> with<00:02:28.280> four

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
pricey so I have to go with four

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.610 
pricey so I have to go with four
gigabytes<00:02:28.939> of<00:02:29.060> RAM<00:02:29.269> in<00:02:29.420> this<00:02:29.689> build<00:02:29.989> I<00:02:30.230> was<00:02:30.500> one

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
gigabytes of RAM in this build I was one

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.140 
gigabytes of RAM in this build I was one
of<00:02:30.709> the<00:02:30.769> big<00:02:30.950> compromises<00:02:31.609> that<00:02:31.670> I<00:02:31.760> had<00:02:31.969> to

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
of the big compromises that I had to

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.629 
of the big compromises that I had to
make<00:02:32.329> but<00:02:32.810> it<00:02:32.989> is<00:02:33.170> just<00:02:33.409> one<00:02:33.709> stick<00:02:34.069> of<00:02:34.099> g.skill

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:34.639 
make but it is just one stick of g.skill

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:36.910 
make but it is just one stick of g.skill
ripjaws<00:02:35.030> series<00:02:35.389> four<00:02:35.629> gigabytes<00:02:36.079> at<00:02:36.200> 1333

ripjaws series four gigabytes at 1333

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.909 
ripjaws series four gigabytes at 1333
speed<00:02:37.250> so<00:02:38.030> in<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.629> future<00:02:38.750> yes<00:02:39.139> just<00:02:39.530> can<00:02:39.739> pick

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:39.919 
speed so in the future yes just can pick

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:42.339 
speed so in the future yes just can pick
up<00:02:40.069> a<00:02:40.159> second<00:02:40.519> stick<00:02:40.760> for<00:02:41.000> $41<00:02:41.900> and<00:02:42.109> then

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
up a second stick for $41 and then

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.170 
up a second stick for $41 and then
you'll<00:02:42.469> be<00:02:42.650> good<00:02:42.799> to<00:02:42.859> go<00:02:42.980> so<00:02:43.340> that's<00:02:43.819> a<00:02:44.030> nice

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
you'll be good to go so that's a nice

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.569 
you'll be good to go so that's a nice
set<00:02:44.419> up<00:02:44.540> their<00:02:44.889> downline<00:02:45.889> you<00:02:46.069> probably<00:02:46.370> will

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
set up their downline you probably will

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:48.039 
set up their downline you probably will
want<00:02:46.609> to<00:02:46.879> pick<00:02:47.000> up<00:02:47.090> an<00:02:47.239> extra<00:02:47.329> stick<00:02:47.750> of<00:02:47.900> this

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
want to pick up an extra stick of this

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:49.869 
want to pick up an extra stick of this
probably<00:02:48.379> you<00:02:48.799> know<00:02:48.829> six<00:02:49.400> months<00:02:49.459> to<00:02:49.790> a<00:02:49.819> year

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
probably you know six months to a year

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.369 
probably you know six months to a year
down<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:50.209> line<00:02:50.389> it's<00:02:50.540> not<00:02:50.659> too<00:02:50.840> expensive<00:02:50.870> at

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
down the line it's not too expensive at

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.830 
down the line it's not too expensive at
$41<00:02:51.919> so<00:02:52.189> I<00:02:52.400> think<00:02:52.669> that's<00:02:53.030> gonna<00:02:53.209> be<00:02:53.299> an<00:02:53.510> easy

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
$41 so I think that's gonna be an easy

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.110 
$41 so I think that's gonna be an easy
you<00:02:54.620> know<00:02:54.739> suddenly<00:02:55.010> easily<00:02:55.609> you<00:02:55.760> guys<00:02:55.909> can

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
you know suddenly easily you guys can

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.059 
you know suddenly easily you guys can
add<00:02:56.269> on<00:02:56.419> to<00:02:56.569> the<00:02:56.659> build<00:02:56.870> in<00:02:57.049> the<00:02:57.079> future<00:02:57.560> for
