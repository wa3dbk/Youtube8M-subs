brick<00:01:29.040> boys<00:01:29.250> invented<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:30.110> sort<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.259> custom

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
brick boys invented this sort of custom

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.260 
brick boys invented this sort of custom
Lego<00:01:31.950> then<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.250> take<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.549> fort<00:01:32.820> brick<00:01:33.060> and

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
Lego then you take the fort brick and

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.490 
Lego then you take the fort brick and
you<00:01:33.329> stick<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.630> on<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.810> back<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.229> normal

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
you stick it on the back of a normal

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.920 
you stick it on the back of a normal
blaster<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.909> what<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.180> can<00:01:36.360> do<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.780> looks

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
blaster and what you can do it looks

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.210 
blaster and what you can do it looks
sort<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.229> awkward<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.829> don't<00:01:38.009> have<00:01:38.130> to

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
sort of awkward and you don't have to

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.210 
sort of awkward and you don't have to
use<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.400> but<00:01:39.180> we<00:01:39.390> thought<00:01:39.740> maybe<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.890> clone

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
use it but we thought maybe a clone

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.020 
use it but we thought maybe a clone
could<00:01:41.520> use<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:41.970> like<00:01:42.659> if<00:01:43.430> the<00:01:44.430> droids<00:01:44.790> are

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
could use it like if the droids are

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.539 
could use it like if the droids are
avoiding<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.450> blast<00:01:45.750> they<00:01:46.470> turn<00:01:46.740> around<00:01:47.009> and

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
avoiding the blast they turn around and

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.609 
avoiding the blast they turn around and
stab<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:47.909> with<00:01:48.210> this<00:01:48.360> sort<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.290> it's<00:01:49.470> like<00:01:49.590> a

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
stab it with this sort of it's like a

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.719 
stab it with this sort of it's like a
bayonet<00:01:49.860> on<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.369> reverse<00:01:50.670> side<00:01:51.530> all<00:01:52.530> right

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
bayonet on the reverse side all right

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.690 
bayonet on the reverse side all right
that's<00:01:53.729> not<00:01:54.060> really<00:01:54.810> required<00:01:55.229> though

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
that's not really required though

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.459 
that's not really required though
another<00:01:56.700> cool<00:01:56.969> thing<00:01:57.000> is<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.479> can<00:01:57.630> take<00:01:57.659> that

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
another cool thing is you can take that

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.340 
another cool thing is you can take that
claw<00:01:58.860> brick<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.340> black<00:01:59.549> clock<00:01:59.820> clobber<00:02:00.570> and

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
claw brick that black clock clobber and
