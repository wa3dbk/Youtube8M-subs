00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.680
 celebrate this tablet blog.de we are 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.869
 at the booth of acer on the ifa 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.670
 2013 in berlin where the acer liquid s2 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.340
 was presented that we have here 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.560
 is a new 6 inch smartphone that 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.210
 unlike most acer smartphone 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.360
 quite current partners had namely 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.149
 a snapdragon 806 is supposed to display full hd 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.780
 display and yes that's why we want that 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:38.090
 acer liquid now twice with the sony 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.980
 20 hits are the same as the hardware 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.320
 about the same both have a snapdragon 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.550
 800 Qualcomm processor of 2.3 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.780
 gigahertz is clocked 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.940
 both have two gigabytes 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.300
 RAM and 16 gigabytes of flash 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.589
 Storage 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:55.460
 the display of the sony kz ultras with 6.4 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:57.289
 inches slightly larger than the liquid it 26 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.339
 inch you can see the resolution 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:02.469
 is at both polar de so 1920 x 1080 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:06.350
 pixel 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:09.470
 Let's take a look at how the processing works 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.110
 is the sony xetra is definitely 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.880
 significantly thinner and it is also easier 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.280
 However, it is also much more expensive 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.800
 The extra is not special in Germany 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.310
 but can be available for 679 euros 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.310
 in front 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.070
 be ordered the acer liquid s2 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.040
 however, could cost 449 euros 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.450
 maybe around the 500 m final price 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.250
 is not yet clear 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.890
 As far as the performance is concerned, both are 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.009
 Of course, quite fast Tonis surface 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.259
 runs pretty good on the extra 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.360
 thanks to the snapdragon 800 normally 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.799
 sometimes electronics surface such a 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.840
 bit the hard-working money also from acer 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.679
 but in the end, everything is right here 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.720
 There is such a fast way of processing 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:53.869
 said the exit z ultra differs 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.069
 You can theoretically in an aquarium 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.920
 drop or go for a swim 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:01.500
 should still work 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.569
 the acer liquid s2 does not quite feel 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.939
 such high quality to be as I said also bcm 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:07.890
 thicker, however, the s2 has one 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.170
 big advantage because she goes to one 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.950
 a 3 10 megapixel camera with this 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.049
 Round LED flash that are four LEDs in it 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.150
 the first ultra solve the camera 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.950
 however, only with 8 megapixels on and it 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.010
 There is no lightning and the camera of the 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.569
 Exponats Ultra is not really that good 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.099
 definitely not current 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:31.840
 smartphones comparable to the sls 2 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.819
 you can still record 4k videos 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.530
 that is still a bit me 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.690
 Do not know if you will leave soon 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.760
 can not really be that way yet 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.080
 many devices 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.750
 yes that is a quick comparison of 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.790
 acer liquid s2 with the nothing berthold 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.239
 I'm changing tablet blog.de her 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.239
 to see you
