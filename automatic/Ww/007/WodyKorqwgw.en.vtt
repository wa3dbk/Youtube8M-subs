 Because I work hard Come alone to play another jar Oh yeah small shore 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:20.020
 It's already good If you can get a laugh, it's not that you're waiting for the school festival at the same time. 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:22.180

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:28.990

 I've been going to university in various places until now, but I say processing for the first time 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:36.830
 Is it familiar? 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:41.210
 But when I saw the station of Maine, I thought it was such a beautiful thing to say Ome Shirane 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:48.910
 So there are a lot of students of urban children there already 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:52.150
 Unpleasant here's a pretty even candidates in sooo beautiful campus I think Gakushuin University car 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:55.220
 Because there was a lot of deko imitation 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:01:00.500
 I think I want to go before the production 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:04.730

 Since the end it well in the end that that this is referred to as a band organization in Mamiya band the school festival

 Keyless child's also to who participated So I'd done with the other full-band configuration 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.920
 So really I come to sing with a hand microphone When spring arrives 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:36.030
 Later 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:42.090
 To sing in the audience and the close distance gave me to go sing to jump at how good and act together 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:46.180
 This is I mean I feel I have been inside would be what what one of the was really raised say 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:50.020

 Really fun and was really another Matsuki in feeling like 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:04.910
 I think that the band's culmination live brother is something of a good upsurge 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:10.550
 It's something of that day's program or vivi and I really enjoy everyone 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:14.230
 Because there were a lot of people who came to see for the first time after knowing why, it was such a great excitement 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.460
 I thought I was happy about the atmosphere 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:21.010
 And 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:22.090
 Doshisha University is in Kyoto but I went to a common campus 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.480
 this 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:30.000
 Echi Mishima Nachan and 3 people in 3 sisters 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:35.520
 I delivered it with an acoustic but 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:38.450
 It was only eight times as long as I walked off on the day . 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:46.550
 The school festival 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:49.040
 Tteyuu I went to the gym and money now only here we'll do in that outside in the campus 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.790
 Because it was live, already 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:57.720
 Now in the car to the campus 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:03:04.800
 It looks like it has already been difficult and bright and dark 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:11.580
 I wonder no woman sunny along or because it has become painful thought I saying to the guys on the other hah blog 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:15.750

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:17.800

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.920

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.790

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:33.409
 Bae acoustic and can live in peace 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:38.460
 I think so wonder if the more processed goods confectionery was feeling I was was 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:42.090
 It is said that about 4,000 people on campus will be out in the wild 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:45.450
 A scene I have never seen before is spreading in front of my eyes 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:49.819
 But in the other side of the people of the campus 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:52.370
 Toka or me look through the window from among the school 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:54.240
 It might be watching me 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.620

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.560

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:05.870

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:13.350
 I'm surprised I said at this time for the first time with mc at this time that I said it later 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:19.180
 I came from the end of the house, but I received an email from Tokyo 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:20.019
 If it's not your first time, you will receive an e-mail saying you're only a Lan . 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.319
 so 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:30.190
 It's a card and it's right before 

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:36.909
 I read it at the time of the band saying that country of Akira- san To the live of Heian Jingu Shrine 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:39.550
 In Takebe's Toka also where known Mr. you'llcome the National Assembly of the program and that the night sky Roh Disable

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:56.779
 It is said that it was the second year of the official year, but it was fine even if Kyoto was fun . 

00:04:53.149 --> 00:05:00.000
 Because I was really worried about the key 

00:04:56.779 --> 00:05:05.150
 By Well that arrived to you I pray Oh Charlottenburg 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.150
