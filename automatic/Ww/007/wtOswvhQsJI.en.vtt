00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
this for this for this deck and the king

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.040 
this for this for this deck and the king
is<00:02:47.640> able<00:02:47.910> to<00:02:47.970> slow<00:02:48.150> down<00:02:48.300> other<00:02:48.540> deaths<00:02:48.810> well

is able to slow down other deaths well

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.190 
is able to slow down other deaths well
not<00:02:49.230> really<00:02:49.440> slowing<00:02:49.800> down<00:02:49.950> yourself<00:02:51.200> then

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
not really slowing down yourself then

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.410 
not really slowing down yourself then
down<00:02:52.530> Yin<00:02:52.770> is<00:02:52.800> another<00:02:53.340> big<00:02:53.610> beater<00:02:53.850> who

basically<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.400> counter<00:02:59.670> traps<00:02:59.910> if<00:03:00.090> you

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
basically the counter traps if you

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.090
