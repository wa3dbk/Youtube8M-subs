00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
number one spot pretty quick I mean a

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.229 
number one spot pretty quick I mean a
few<00:02:23.319> buddies<00:02:23.560> man<00:02:23.920> there's<00:02:24.670> some<00:02:24.819> pretty<00:02:24.970> epic

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
few buddies man there's some pretty epic

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.839 
few buddies man there's some pretty epic
stuff<00:02:25.720> on<00:02:25.930> there<00:02:26.140> and<00:02:26.349> they're<00:02:27.010> actually<00:02:27.160> the

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
stuff on there and they're actually the

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.210 
stuff on there and they're actually the
battles<00:02:28.239> they're<00:02:28.480> like<00:02:28.660> real<00:02:28.959> chess<00:02:29.950> board

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
battles they're like real chess board

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.009 
battles they're like real chess board
like<00:02:30.430> battles<00:02:30.940> that<00:02:31.060> you<00:02:31.180> can<00:02:31.330> apply<00:02:31.569> a<00:02:31.660> lot<00:02:31.900> of

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
like battles that you can apply a lot of

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.309 
like battles that you can apply a lot of
strategy<00:02:32.590> to<00:02:32.830> as<00:02:32.980> well<00:02:33.160> so<00:02:33.670> I<00:02:33.970> think<00:02:34.930> that's

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
strategy to as well so I think that's

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.759 
strategy to as well so I think that's
the<00:02:35.709> reason<00:02:35.860> why<00:02:36.040> people<00:02:36.870> like<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:38.140> game<00:02:38.349> and

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
the reason why people like the game and

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.610 
the reason why people like the game and
you<00:02:38.860> can<00:02:39.040> actually<00:02:39.459> spend<00:02:40.500> hundreds<00:02:41.500> of

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
you can actually spend hundreds of

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.589 
you can actually spend hundreds of
