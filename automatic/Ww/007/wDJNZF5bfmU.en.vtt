this include basically a pocket of sorts
where<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:39.960> can<00:00:40.110> actually<00:00:40.320> insert<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:42.110> chemical

warming pouch if if you're in really

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.930

those<00:00:47.670> extreme<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.270> conditions<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:49.640> guess<00:00:50.640> if<00:00:50.789> I

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
those extreme of conditions I guess if I

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.150 
those extreme of conditions I guess if I
were<00:00:51.090> biking<00:00:51.989> in<00:00:52.260> those<00:00:52.440> conditions<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:53.010> might

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
were biking in those conditions I might

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.840 
were biking in those conditions I might
consider<00:00:53.520> more<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.500> strictly<00:00:55.520> winter<00:00:56.520> shoe

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
consider more of a strictly winter shoe

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.400 
consider more of a strictly winter shoe
but<00:00:57.149> nonetheless<00:00:57.360> that's<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.960> feature<00:00:58.140> that

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
but nonetheless that's a feature that

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.729 
but nonetheless that's a feature that
they<00:00:58.559> offer<00:00:58.969> they<00:00:59.969> also<00:01:00.090> have<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:00.449> nice<00:01:00.739> they

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
they offer they also have this nice they

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.189 
they offer they also have this nice they
guess<00:01:01.980> they<00:01:02.100> call<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.280> an<00:01:02.340> Ergo<00:01:02.670> access<00:01:03.210> pouch

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
guess they call it an Ergo access pouch

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.850 
guess they call it an Ergo access pouch

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
obviously their covers are going to be

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.960 
obviously their covers are going to be
more<00:01:32.780> in<00:01:33.780> line<00:01:34.140> with<00:01:34.200> their<00:01:34.920> own<00:01:35.070> shoes<00:01:35.490> you

it's<00:01:39.119> probably<00:01:39.630> going<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.900> be<00:01:39.990> best<00:01:40.140> if

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
it's probably going to be best if

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.760 
through that's sort of quilting quilting
pattern<00:02:20.090> it's<00:02:20.270> it's<00:02:20.600> got<00:02:20.930> some<00:02:21.170> thickness<00:02:21.440> to

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
pattern it's it's got some thickness to

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.059 
pattern it's it's got some thickness to
it<00:02:22.540> I'm<00:02:23.540> really<00:02:23.810> excited<00:02:24.050> to<00:02:24.350> see<00:02:24.530> how<00:02:24.800> well

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
it I'm really excited to see how well

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.880 
it I'm really excited to see how well
that<00:02:25.330> that<00:02:26.330> insulates<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.440> front<00:02:27.680> of<00:02:27.770> your

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
that that insulates the front of your

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.910 
that that insulates the front of your
shoe<00:02:28.040> because<00:02:28.160> really<00:02:28.459> that's<00:02:29.800> probably<00:02:30.800> the

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
shoe because really that's probably the

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.230 
shoe because really that's probably the
area<00:02:31.070> that<00:02:31.459> you<00:02:31.580> need<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.850> most<00:02:32.000> protection

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
area that you need the most protection

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.330 
area that you need the most protection
and<00:02:35.240> again<00:02:35.600> these<00:02:35.750> are<00:02:35.900> going<00:02:36.050> to<00:02:36.110> be<00:02:36.340> probably

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
and again these are going to be probably

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.610 
and again these are going to be probably
best<00:02:37.610> paired<00:02:37.880> with<00:02:38.000> their<00:02:38.180> shoes<00:02:38.480> but<00:02:38.870> as<00:02:39.290> far

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
best paired with their shoes but as far

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.470 
best paired with their shoes but as far
as<00:02:39.650> applying<00:02:40.520> them<00:02:40.700> to<00:02:40.730> the<00:02:40.910> specialized

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
as applying them to the specialized

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.690 
as applying them to the specialized
shoes<00:02:41.690> that<00:02:41.870> I<00:02:41.900> have<00:02:42.170> I<00:02:42.470> think<00:02:42.530> they<00:02:42.950> end<00:02:43.280> up

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
shoes that I have I think they end up

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.660 
shoes that I have I think they end up
working<00:02:43.910> very<00:02:44.270> well<00:02:44.390> as<00:02:44.720> far<00:02:44.959> as<00:02:44.989> where<00:02:45.670> where

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
working very well as far as where where

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.400 
working very well as far as where where
the<00:02:46.790> wear<00:02:46.970> spots<00:02:47.300> are<00:02:47.510> in<00:02:47.540> these<00:02:47.780> shoes<00:02:48.110> and

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
the wear spots are in these shoes and

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.350 
the wear spots are in these shoes and
just<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:48.709> access<00:02:49.070> to<00:02:49.220> everything<00:02:49.459> the<00:02:50.180> only

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
just the access to everything the only

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.840 
just the access to everything the only
issue<00:02:50.510> I<00:02:51.130> potentially<00:02:52.130> will<00:02:52.250> have<00:02:52.430> is<00:02:52.640> this

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
issue I potentially will have is this

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.370 
issue I potentially will have is this
access<00:02:53.390> here<00:02:53.540> you<00:02:53.690> can<00:02:53.810> kind<00:02:53.989> of<00:02:54.050> see<00:02:54.230> that

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
access here you can kind of see that

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.990 
access here you can kind of see that
there's<00:02:54.590> maybe<00:02:55.519> this<00:02:55.700> will<00:02:55.850> come<00:02:55.970> through

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
there's maybe this will come through

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.820 
there's maybe this will come through
yeah

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
yeah

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.320 
yeah
there's<00:02:57.830> a<00:02:57.950> vent<00:02:58.519> right<00:02:58.640> on<00:02:58.880> the<00:02:58.940> bottom<00:02:59.239> of

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
there's a vent right on the bottom of

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:00.820 
there's a vent right on the bottom of
the<00:02:59.450> shoe<00:02:59.690> there<00:02:59.900> because<00:03:00.440> this<00:03:00.650> is

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
the shoe there because this is

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.060 
the shoe there because this is
definitely<00:03:01.519> a<00:03:01.670> summer<00:03:02.000> shoe<00:03:02.920> really<00:03:03.920> I

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
definitely a summer shoe really I

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.290 
definitely a summer shoe really I
probably<00:03:04.310> will<00:03:04.489> just<00:03:04.550> need<00:03:04.760> to<00:03:04.820> tape<00:03:05.060> that<00:03:05.239> up

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
probably will just need to tape that up

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.020 
probably will just need to tape that up
this<00:03:05.870> shoe<00:03:06.410> cover<00:03:06.620> isn't<00:03:06.860> going<00:03:07.220> to<00:03:07.400> isn't

going<00:03:08.209> to<00:03:08.330> cover<00:03:08.510> that<00:03:08.720> but<00:03:08.870> I<00:03:08.900> can't<00:03:09.110> really

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
going to cover that but I can't really

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.840 
going to cover that but I can't really

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.949 
bobak for for designing it as such

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959

simply because it's they can't design it
to<00:03:14.989> fit<00:03:15.230> every<00:03:15.440> shoe<00:03:15.680> so<00:03:16.390> there's<00:03:17.390> also<00:03:17.540> this

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
to fit every shoe so there's also this

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
nice wear area here again they describe

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.069 
nice wear area here again they describe
these<00:03:21.769> covers<00:03:22.220> as<00:03:22.400> their<00:03:22.970> most<00:03:23.209> robust<00:03:23.750> and

these covers as their most robust and

these covers as their most robust and
this<00:03:24.230> is<00:03:24.440> a<00:03:24.530> nice<00:03:24.860> added<00:03:25.400> feature<00:03:25.630> to<00:03:26.630> to

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
this is a nice added feature to to

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.500 
this is a nice added feature to to
prevent<00:03:27.650> tearing<00:03:28.100> this<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:28.820> shoe<00:03:29.060> cover<00:03:29.329> up

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
prevent tearing this the shoe cover up

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.569 
prevent tearing this the shoe cover up
if<00:03:29.630> you<00:03:29.750> do<00:03:29.959> happen<00:03:30.170> to<00:03:30.350> put<00:03:30.560> your<00:03:30.739> your<00:03:31.250> foot

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
if you do happen to put your your foot

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:32.890 
if you do happen to put your your foot
down<00:03:31.790> rather<00:03:32.030> than<00:03:32.150> just<00:03:32.480> stepping<00:03:32.720> on<00:03:32.810> the

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
down rather than just stepping on the

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.340 
down rather than just stepping on the
cleat<00:03:33.140> or<00:03:33.170> the<00:03:33.350> heel<00:03:34.299> there's<00:03:35.299> just<00:03:35.870> a<00:03:35.989> tiny

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
cleat or the heel there's just a tiny

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.060 
cleat or the heel there's just a tiny
bit<00:03:36.620> of<00:03:37.540> bunching<00:03:38.540> behind<00:03:39.200> the<00:03:39.350> cleat<00:03:39.560> here<00:03:39.920> I

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
bit of bunching behind the cleat here I

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.759 
bit of bunching behind the cleat here I
think<00:03:40.519> the<00:03:40.670> time<00:03:40.940> I<00:03:41.329> click<00:03:41.840> cleats<00:03:42.470> that<00:03:42.590> I'm

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
think the time I click cleats that I'm

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:47.319 
think the time I click cleats that I'm
using<00:03:42.980> are<00:03:43.549> kind<00:03:44.360> of<00:03:44.450> chunky<00:03:46.060> not<00:03:47.060> the

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
using are kind of chunky not the

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.199 
using are kind of chunky not the
smallest<00:03:47.600> cleat<00:03:47.959> in<00:03:48.079> the<00:03:48.170> world<00:03:48.350> so<00:03:49.130> and<00:03:49.910> quite

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
smallest cleat in the world so and quite

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:51.970 
smallest cleat in the world so and quite
frankly<00:03:50.360> the<00:03:50.660> engagement<00:03:51.230> is<00:03:51.380> all<00:03:51.530> within

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
frankly the engagement is all within

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.229 
frankly the engagement is all within
here<00:03:52.489> so<00:03:53.090> this<00:03:53.570> won't<00:03:54.110> be<00:03:54.290> an<00:03:54.410> issue<00:03:54.530> as<00:03:54.829> far<00:03:54.860> as

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
here so this won't be an issue as far as

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.490 
here so this won't be an issue as far as
getting<00:03:56.239> caught<00:03:56.600> on<00:03:56.840> the<00:03:56.930> pedals<00:03:57.200> or<00:03:57.320> anything

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
getting caught on the pedals or anything

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.190 
getting caught on the pedals or anything
so<00:03:58.370> ultimately<00:03:59.180> I<00:03:59.299> think<00:03:59.360> the<00:03:59.540> fit<00:03:59.810> is<00:03:59.989> very

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
so ultimately I think the fit is very

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.500 
so ultimately I think the fit is very
good<00:04:00.500> it<00:04:01.010> accommodates<00:04:01.519> the<00:04:01.730> cleat<00:04:02.000> quite

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
good it accommodates the cleat quite

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.229 
good it accommodates the cleat quite
well<00:04:02.750> I<00:04:03.019> just<00:04:03.260> have<00:04:03.410> to<00:04:04.090> compensate<00:04:05.090> for

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
well I just have to compensate for

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.740 
well I just have to compensate for
having<00:04:05.510> this<00:04:05.630> this<00:04:05.989> little<00:04:06.200> vent<00:04:06.530> here

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
having this this little vent here

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.970 
having this this little vent here
getting<00:04:08.750> these<00:04:08.840> on<00:04:09.019> the<00:04:09.140> shoes<00:04:09.350> wasn't<00:04:09.680> too

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
getting these on the shoes wasn't too

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.940 
getting these on the shoes wasn't too
difficult<00:04:10.299> they<00:04:11.299> have<00:04:11.390> this<00:04:11.510> nice<00:04:11.950> zipper

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
difficult they have this nice zipper

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.039 
difficult they have this nice zipper
access<00:04:13.370> on<00:04:13.549> the<00:04:13.640> back<00:04:13.850> I<00:04:14.209> guess<00:04:14.630> I<00:04:14.780> kind<00:04:15.019> of

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
access on the back I guess I kind of

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:19.360 
access on the back I guess I kind of
feel<00:04:15.260> like<00:04:17.530> there<00:04:18.530> isn't<00:04:18.680> going<00:04:18.919> to<00:04:19.010> be<00:04:19.100> a<00:04:19.160> ton

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
feel like there isn't going to be a ton

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:20.979 
feel like there isn't going to be a ton
of<00:04:19.400> taking<00:04:19.760> these<00:04:19.850> on<00:04:20.030> and<00:04:20.180> off<00:04:20.239> aside<00:04:20.750> from

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
of taking these on and off aside from

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.870 
of taking these on and off aside from
just<00:04:21.229> at<00:04:21.919> the<00:04:22.039> beginning<00:04:22.370> of<00:04:22.430> the<00:04:22.520> season<00:04:22.700> and

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
just at the beginning of the season and

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:23.520 
just at the beginning of the season and
the<00:04:23.000> end<00:04:23.150> of<00:04:23.270> this

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
the end of this

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.940 
the end of this
so<00:04:23.980> I<00:04:24.670> don't<00:04:25.150> see<00:04:25.300> that<00:04:25.420> as<00:04:25.570> a<00:04:25.600> huge<00:04:25.690> a<00:04:26.380> huge

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
so I don't see that as a huge a huge

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.410 
so I don't see that as a huge a huge
benefit<00:04:27.370> if<00:04:27.520> they're<00:04:27.760> a<00:04:27.790> little<00:04:28.000> difficult<00:04:28.360> to

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.420 
benefit if they're a little difficult to

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:29.820 
benefit if they're a little difficult to
get<00:04:28.570> on<00:04:28.660> and<00:04:28.840> off<00:04:28.900> but<00:04:29.230> if<00:04:29.320> you<00:04:29.530> do<00:04:29.650> want

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
get on and off but if you do want

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.920 
get on and off but if you do want
something<00:04:30.040> that's<00:04:30.310> easy<00:04:30.520> too<00:04:30.700> easy<00:04:31.000> to<00:04:31.630> remove

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
something that's easy too easy to remove

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.350 
something that's easy too easy to remove
from<00:04:32.170> your<00:04:32.260> shoes<00:04:32.640> maybe<00:04:33.640> for<00:04:33.910> cleaning

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
from your shoes maybe for cleaning

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.080 
from your shoes maybe for cleaning
moreso<00:04:34.960> than<00:04:34.990> anything<00:04:35.410> else<00:04:35.680> I<00:04:36.040> did<00:04:36.850> find

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
moreso than anything else I did find

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.970 
moreso than anything else I did find
these<00:04:37.180> to<00:04:37.330> be<00:04:37.360> relatively<00:04:38.350> easy<00:04:38.530> to<00:04:38.710> get<00:04:38.830> on

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
these to be relatively easy to get on

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.360 
these to be relatively easy to get on
and<00:04:39.160> off<00:04:39.250> I<00:04:39.670> would<00:04:40.330> just<00:04:40.510> take<00:04:40.950> take<00:04:41.950> care<00:04:42.190> not

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
and off I would just take take care not

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.510 
and off I would just take take care not
to<00:04:42.400> get<00:04:42.610> it<00:04:42.730> caught<00:04:42.910> in<00:04:43.060> your<00:04:43.180> cleat<00:04:43.450> because

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
to get it caught in your cleat because

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.290 
to get it caught in your cleat because
obviously<00:04:45.520> some<00:04:45.700> of<00:04:45.790> them<00:04:45.910> can<00:04:46.060> have<00:04:46.150> little

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
obviously some of them can have little

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.900 
obviously some of them can have little
shards<00:04:47.260> as<00:04:47.440> they<00:04:47.680> as<00:04:47.950> they<00:04:48.130> start<00:04:48.400> to<00:04:48.430> wear<00:04:48.730> and

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
shards as they as they start to wear and

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.970 
shards as they as they start to wear and
you'd<00:04:49.030> hate<00:04:49.150> to<00:04:49.330> tear<00:04:49.540> these<00:04:49.750> but<00:04:50.050> but<00:04:50.710> the

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
you'd hate to tear these but but the

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.590 
you'd hate to tear these but but the
materials<00:04:51.400> do<00:04:51.550> seem<00:04:51.760> relatively<00:04:52.240> robust

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
materials do seem relatively robust

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.680 
materials do seem relatively robust
there's<00:04:53.440> nice<00:04:53.790> silicone<00:04:55.770> little<00:04:56.770> spots

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
there's nice silicone little spots

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.230 
there's nice silicone little spots
around<00:04:58.690> this<00:04:58.810> cuff<00:04:59.230> which<00:04:59.830> help<00:05:00.130> keep<00:05:00.580> the

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
around this cuff which help keep the

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.050 
around this cuff which help keep the
cuff<00:05:01.450> in<00:05:01.630> place<00:05:01.930> it's<00:05:02.620> kind<00:05:02.860> of<00:05:02.890> a<00:05:02.980> nice<00:05:03.160> fleece

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
cuff in place it's kind of a nice fleece

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.900 
cuff in place it's kind of a nice fleece
liner<00:05:04.590> know<00:05:05.590> if<00:05:05.770> that's<00:05:05.950> coming<00:05:06.280> through<00:05:06.460> on

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
liner know if that's coming through on

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.270 
liner know if that's coming through on
the<00:05:07.060> camera<00:05:07.090> but<00:05:07.600> it's<00:05:08.530> got<00:05:08.710> just<00:05:08.890> kind<00:05:09.220> of

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
the camera but it's got just kind of

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.570 
the camera but it's got just kind of
like<00:05:09.430> a<00:05:09.960> internal<00:05:10.960> glove<00:05:11.320> fleece<00:05:12.070> like<00:05:12.370> liner

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
like a internal glove fleece like liner

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.159 
like a internal glove fleece like liner
very<00:05:15.580> comfortable<00:05:16.150> like<00:05:16.360> I've<00:05:16.600> tried<00:05:16.900> these

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
very comfortable like I've tried these

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:19.020 
very comfortable like I've tried these
on<00:05:17.380> I<00:05:17.410> haven't<00:05:17.860> reviewed<00:05:18.010> them<00:05:18.310> just<00:05:18.580> yet<00:05:18.760> but

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
on I haven't reviewed them just yet but

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.600 
on I haven't reviewed them just yet but
the<00:05:19.630> the<00:05:19.990> fit<00:05:20.200> is<00:05:20.320> very<00:05:20.560> comfortable<00:05:21.100> they're

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
the the fit is very comfortable they're

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.120 
the the fit is very comfortable they're
not<00:05:21.960> overly<00:05:22.960> tight<00:05:23.290> they're<00:05:23.710> certainly<00:05:24.040> not

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
not overly tight they're certainly not

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.010 
not overly tight they're certainly not
loose<00:05:24.580> they're<00:05:25.030> just<00:05:25.210> really<00:05:25.540> a<00:05:25.690> very

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
loose they're just really a very

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.730 
loose they're just really a very
appropriate<00:05:26.470> fit<00:05:26.890> the<00:05:27.460> materials<00:05:27.970> seem<00:05:28.210> great

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
appropriate fit the materials seem great

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.969 
appropriate fit the materials seem great
and<00:05:30.150> I<00:05:31.150> guess<00:05:32.020> probably<00:05:32.140> you<00:05:32.410> weight<00:05:32.560> wienies

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979 
and I guess probably you weight wienies

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:36.780 
and I guess probably you weight wienies
it's<00:05:33.460> not<00:05:34.200> certainly<00:05:35.200> not<00:05:35.790> particularly

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 
it's not certainly not particularly

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.230 
it's not certainly not particularly
heavy<00:05:37.030> but<00:05:37.690> it's<00:05:38.440> a<00:05:38.560> shoe<00:05:38.740> cover<00:05:38.979> so<00:05:39.340> that<00:05:39.760> I

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
heavy but it's a shoe cover so that I

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.550 
heavy but it's a shoe cover so that I
really<00:05:40.540> don't<00:05:40.690> want<00:05:40.840> to<00:05:40.900> focus<00:05:41.020> on<00:05:41.290> the<00:05:41.380> weight

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
really don't want to focus on the weight

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.260 
really don't want to focus on the weight
of<00:05:42.030> a<00:05:43.030> product<00:05:43.479> like<00:05:43.660> this<00:05:43.690> so<00:05:44.820> the<00:05:45.820> only<00:05:45.850> other

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
of a product like this so the only other

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.820 
of a product like this so the only other
thing<00:05:46.390> I'd<00:05:46.600> like<00:05:46.690> to<00:05:46.750> do<00:05:47.020> is<00:05:47.200> just<00:05:47.229> do<00:05:47.590> a<00:05:47.620> quick

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
thing I'd like to do is just do a quick

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.620 
thing I'd like to do is just do a quick
water<00:05:48.070> test<00:05:48.430> which<00:05:48.729> I've<00:05:48.970> kind<00:05:49.419> of<00:05:49.450> already

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
water test which I've kind of already

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:57.530 
water test which I've kind of already
done<00:05:50.850> for<00:05:51.850> myself<00:05:52.000> of<00:05:52.510> curiosity

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.540 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.950 

I<00:05:57.570> think<00:05:58.110> not<00:05:58.230> only<00:05:58.700> not<00:05:59.700> only<00:05:59.730> should<00:06:00.690> a

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
I think not only not only should a

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.750 
I think not only not only should a
winter<00:06:01.560> ride<00:06:01.770> or<00:06:01.920> assuming<00:06:02.310> we're<00:06:02.430> talking

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:02.760 
winter ride or assuming we're talking

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:03.890 
winter ride or assuming we're talking
about<00:06:02.850> commuting<00:06:03.210> on<00:06:03.420> the<00:06:03.510> roads<00:06:03.690> be

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
about commuting on the roads be

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.800 
about commuting on the roads be
concerned<00:06:04.350> with<00:06:04.850> water<00:06:05.850> but<00:06:06.060> also<00:06:06.210> debris<00:06:06.720> and

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
concerned with water but also debris and

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.980 
concerned with water but also debris and
how<00:06:06.930> well<00:06:07.080> it's<00:06:07.200> going<00:06:07.350> to<00:06:07.410> seal<00:06:07.620> from<00:06:07.800> that

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
how well it's going to seal from that

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.910 
how well it's going to seal from that
honestly<00:06:09.990> I'm<00:06:10.230> not<00:06:11.600> I'm<00:06:12.600> not<00:06:12.920> incredibly

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:13.920 
honestly I'm not I'm not incredibly

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.860 
honestly I'm not I'm not incredibly
impressed<00:06:14.280> with<00:06:14.580> with<00:06:15.000> the<00:06:15.090> material<00:06:15.510> it<00:06:15.690> does

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
impressed with with the material it does

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.870 
impressed with with the material it does
seem<00:06:16.080> to<00:06:16.230> shed<00:06:16.440> it<00:06:16.590> somewhat<00:06:17.370> well<00:06:17.520> but<00:06:17.760> it

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 
seem to shed it somewhat well but it

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.740 
seem to shed it somewhat well but it
also<00:06:18.120> does<00:06:18.740> seem<00:06:19.740> to<00:06:20.010> to<00:06:20.910> kind<00:06:21.180> of<00:06:21.240> soak<00:06:21.510> it<00:06:21.690> up

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:21.750 
also does seem to to kind of soak it up

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.040 
also does seem to to kind of soak it up
relatively<00:06:22.320> quickly<00:06:22.910> I<00:06:23.910> guess<00:06:24.630> really

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
relatively quickly I guess really

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.720 
relatively quickly I guess really
testing<00:06:25.680> it<00:06:25.770> outside<00:06:26.010> of<00:06:26.070> my<00:06:26.190> apartment<00:06:26.280> is

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:26.730 
testing it outside of my apartment is

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:28.870 
testing it outside of my apartment is
what's<00:06:26.910> going<00:06:27.120> to<00:06:27.180> be<00:06:27.300> the<00:06:27.390> key<00:06:27.570> here<00:06:27.780> to<00:06:27.810> see

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 
what's going to be the key here to see

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.600 
what's going to be the key here to see
how<00:06:29.880> long<00:06:30.090> of<00:06:30.240> a<00:06:30.300> ride<00:06:30.330> you<00:06:30.600> can<00:06:30.720> go<00:06:30.840> on<00:06:30.990> before

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:31.610 
how long of a ride you can go on before

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.180 
how long of a ride you can go on before
just<00:06:32.780> that<00:06:33.780> that<00:06:34.170> moisture<00:06:34.860> ends<00:06:35.070> up

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:35.190 
just that that moisture ends up

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.010 
just that that moisture ends up
saturating<00:06:35.760> into<00:06:35.910> the<00:06:36.000> material<00:06:36.450> no<00:06:36.750> longer

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 
saturating into the material no longer

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.380 
saturating into the material no longer
repels<00:06:37.560> the<00:06:37.770> water<00:06:37.800> so<00:06:38.400> that'll<00:06:39.060> kind<00:06:39.240> of<00:06:39.300> be

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:39.390 
repels the water so that'll kind of be

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:40.700 
repels the water so that'll kind of be
the<00:06:39.510> long<00:06:39.660> test<00:06:39.930> to<00:06:40.170> see<00:06:40.350> how<00:06:40.500> well<00:06:40.530> it

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:40.710 
the long test to see how well it

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.760 
the long test to see how well it
performs<00:06:41.040> in<00:06:41.250> the<00:06:41.340> real<00:06:41.520> world<00:06:41.790> otherwise<00:06:42.770> it

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:43.770 
performs in the real world otherwise it

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.040 
performs in the real world otherwise it
certainly<00:06:44.070> does<00:06:44.280> seem<00:06:44.520> to<00:06:44.730> repel<00:06:45.060> it<00:06:45.210> repel

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.050 
certainly does seem to repel it repel

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.160 
certainly does seem to repel it repel
water<00:06:46.290> -<00:06:46.650> to<00:06:47.310> some<00:06:47.550> extent<00:06:47.940> so<00:06:48.300> again<00:06:48.990> we'll

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:49.170 
water - to some extent so again we'll

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:50.570 
water - to some extent so again we'll
just<00:06:49.200> have<00:06:49.470> to<00:06:49.590> see<00:06:49.770> how<00:06:49.860> that<00:06:49.920> performs<00:06:50.370> in

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.580 
just have to see how that performs in

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.310 
just have to see how that performs in
the<00:06:50.670> real<00:06:50.850> world<00:06:51.120> and<00:06:51.360> that<00:06:51.870> will<00:06:52.080> be

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:52.320 
the real world and that will be

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.350 
the real world and that will be
