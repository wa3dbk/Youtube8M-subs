00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:07.670
 54th edition of the Genoa boat race 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:09.950
 italmar with us is an old acquaintance 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:13.579
 for not only sea alan cognolato nautic 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.440
 show for a year you have married a brand 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:18.980
 which we remember is a brand that is born in 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.080
 sicily boats for those who want 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.509
 get closer to what is passion 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.400
 to live sea not only the sea 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:27.289
 also our lakes which are many lake 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.480
 of garda because you represent a little 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:33.740
 all the north east of Italy therefore the 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:36.620
 Venetian with everything they asked for 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.840
 Venetian lagoon that is already a happy medium 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.070
 between the sea lake and then the lake of garda 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.200
 that everyone knows 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.060
 a beautiful lake that boats 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.130
 they lend a little to all these environments 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.470
 just the one of that march 4 models 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.730
 you brought that you can give it 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.770
 possibility to really have so many people 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.750
 which we also see a lot these days 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.550
 hot one was arrived late 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.400
 so many people approach their own 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.870
 boats that you present because maybe 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.730
 they are also approaching for the first 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.369
 turn to good boats 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.590
 francesco is all right 

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:09.020
 then this italmar construction site that gives 28 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.300
 years builds boats from 5 to 10 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.300
 meters took a huge leap of 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:17.960
 quality from the year 2013 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.370
 to date also thanks to my support 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.290
 in your collaboration 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.820
 an elaboration a close 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.280
 own collaboration made game of 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.710
 team and we have improved a lot 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.210
 the quality the finishing touches that way 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.010
 it should be what we remember for you 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.600
 you are the dealer, however 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.990
 serious dealer is what then 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:39.409
 he married a brand and brought that with him 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.850
 which is also a bit of information 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.800
 you gather by talking to people 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.840
 with people passing by because you are you 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.700
 then directly in contact with i 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.110
 boaters with families and this is 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.220
 important then that they also listen 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.890
 the dealer here must 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:55.840
 collaborate marry each other 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:02:01.130
 exact with the needs of my clients 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:04.430
 managing to have a good dialogue I have 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.909
 put together all these requests e 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.530
 I brought them to the Italmar company 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.540
 with the company we chose to 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.489
 apply them clearly by finding a 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.000
 compromise between all those that are certain 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.390
 of course 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.610
 here all you can not every church 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.110
 singh and customize the boats for 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.480
 this cannot be truly divinity 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.129
 but there are some fundamental things 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.060
 a simple and beautiful example also from 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:31.250
 to say is the lateral life that in Venice is 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.140
 therefore much used is very much in demand 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.060
 all the boats that leave from 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.790
 Sicily to get into mine 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.730
 mestre dealership ok montano di 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.860
 series the bollard laterally but it is 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.040
 first prepared during construction 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.750
 to avoid real damage if it should 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.810
 there is a strong tear so it is 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.849
 strong and resistant fiberglass box 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.959
 like those in the bow and stern 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:55.220
 this is an example 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.230
 this is the example of how it can be 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.480
 change what has a good one 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.489
 starting boat to optimize 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.959
 those that are then the requests that 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.390
 they come from what is precisely the 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.980
 public that goes by sea and every and every 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.780
 target let's say it also changes second 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.700
 of the areas where you go to surf 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.290
 you have the high adriatic is clear is 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.819
 different from what may be the 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.310
 low Mediterranean sea 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.630
 each area has its needs among 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.970
 quotation marks also related to 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.430
 conditions that meet and this does 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.040
 yes you give this information fair 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.380
 presented four important models there 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.329
 there are two open and two cabinets, indeed there is a 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.139
 walk around 3 which is also a cabin cruiser 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:34.730
 then there is an open cabin a real e 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:38.299
 we have thirty active models 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:42.950
 let's start with the open eye walkarounds a 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:47.030
 cabinets of all these from 5 meters to 10 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.889
 meters we cover the entire range one 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.870
 range able to satisfy those for the 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:52.880
 first time begins and also who is not 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.950
 for the first time because because on the 7 8 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.049
 meters we are already at the next step to the 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.019
 change the levels exactly 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:02.480
 I take this opportunity to tell you to invite everyone 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:03.600
 18 19 at the sea trials he organized 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.080
 with 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:10.830
 all motorized hitler boats 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:13.170
 with a free sea trial free e 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.120
 to be able to appreciate them appreciate those 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.130
 which are the characteristics of le 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.350
 marine performance that unfortunately here 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.489
 they are the nautical ones if you are not in the water not 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.590
 you can try 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.350
 we know that Genoa does not have much 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.600
 space in the water because the marina is already 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.250
 busy with very large boats 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.580
 so these to prove them you need 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.560
 then come to you or in Sicily you 18 19 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.230
 October in the present network right on 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.770
 high Adriatic sea in the area I do 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:43.050
 its own Venetian lagoon yes 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.580
 sail in the lagoon in the lagoon and then it will be 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.410
 an opportunity not only to appreciate 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.430
 of marine performances but also for 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.170
 appreciate what the lagoon of 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.730
 venice that we have seen more 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.730
 sometimes even with the helicopter is a 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.860
 lagoon that the world weighs envy of all 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.200
 that's right then we do 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.060
 congratulations to those who still believe in this 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.770
 sector that fortunately in these in 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.350
 this salon weekend is giving us 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.200
 some hope we can 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.210
 return tree to the true nautical one 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.310

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.640

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.880
 positive 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.350

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.690
