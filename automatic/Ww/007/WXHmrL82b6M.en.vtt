is going to be to establish that running
game<00:00:05.879> kinda<00:00:06.359> have<00:00:06.629> a<00:00:06.660> balanced<00:00:06.960> attack<00:00:07.140> on

game kinda have a balanced attack on

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.270 
game kinda have a balanced attack on
offense<00:00:07.680> well<00:00:08.429> I<00:00:08.460> think<00:00:09.380> you<00:00:10.380> know<00:00:10.500> it<00:00:10.559> really

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
offense well I think you know it really

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.799 
offense well I think you know it really
just<00:00:11.550> comes<00:00:11.610> down<00:00:11.820> to<00:00:11.940> whatever<00:00:12.179> our<00:00:12.450> coaches

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
just comes down to whatever our coaches

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.959 
just comes down to whatever our coaches
call<00:00:13.019> I<00:00:13.049> know<00:00:13.230> we<00:00:14.160> obviously<00:00:14.280> would<00:00:14.700> like<00:00:14.849> to

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
call I know we obviously would like to

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.029 
call I know we obviously would like to
be<00:00:15.059> balanced<00:00:15.480> but<00:00:15.599> I<00:00:15.630> think<00:00:15.870> same<00:00:16.830> thing<00:00:16.949> is

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
be balanced but I think same thing is

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.880 
be balanced but I think same thing is
you<00:00:17.100> have<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.250> kind<00:00:17.340> of<00:00:17.430> adjust<00:00:17.550> with<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.029> game

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
you have to kind of adjust with the game

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.870 
you have to kind of adjust with the game
you<00:00:19.890> know<00:00:19.980> kind<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.279> take<00:00:20.460> what<00:00:20.609> they<00:00:20.699> give<00:00:20.730> you

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
you know kind of take what they give you

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.160 
you know kind of take what they give you
if<00:00:21.060> they're<00:00:21.180> giving<00:00:21.390> us<00:00:21.449> good<00:00:21.600> run<00:00:21.779> looks<00:00:22.020> and

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
if they're giving us good run looks and

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.410 
if they're giving us good run looks and
we'll<00:00:22.260> run<00:00:22.410> if<00:00:22.619> you<00:00:23.340> know<00:00:23.430> if<00:00:23.580> they're<00:00:23.760> loading

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
we'll run if you know if they're loading

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.910 
we'll run if you know if they're loading
the<00:00:24.480> box<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:24.869> daring<00:00:25.109> us<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.230> throw<00:00:25.529> then<00:00:25.740> you

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
the box and daring us to throw then you

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.109 
the box and daring us to throw then you
know<00:00:26.010> we'll<00:00:26.189> have<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.369> adjust<00:00:26.640> accordingly

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
know we'll have to adjust accordingly

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.509 
know we'll have to adjust accordingly
but<00:00:27.330> i<00:00:27.390> think<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:28.349> know<00:00:28.410> any<00:00:28.650> team<00:00:29.189> wants<00:00:29.429> to

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
but i think you know any team wants to

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:30.980 
but i think you know any team wants to
be<00:00:29.609> balanced<00:00:30.000> but<00:00:30.119> i<00:00:30.150> think<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.480> when<00:00:30.900> it

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
be balanced but i think and when it

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.089 
be balanced but i think and when it
comes<00:00:31.170> down<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.590> during<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.890> game<00:00:32.070> you

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
comes down to it during the game you

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.770 
comes down to it during the game you
kind<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.430> just<00:00:32.610> do<00:00:33.000> whatever<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.420> game<00:00:33.570> tells

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
kind of just do whatever the game tells

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.540 
kind of just do whatever the game tells
you<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:33.989> do<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.829> see<00:00:34.980> this<00:00:35.100> often<00:00:35.309> so

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
you to do and you see this often so

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.280 
you to do and you see this often so
obviously<00:00:35.850> been<00:00:36.059> pretty<00:00:36.390> prolific<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:36.989> far<00:00:37.170> so

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
obviously been pretty prolific so far so

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.630 
obviously been pretty prolific so far so
how<00:00:37.380> important<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:37.739> going<00:00:37.980> for<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.219> guys<00:00:38.399> stay

on<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.790> field<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.239> defense<00:00:40.110> isn't<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.440> wouldn't

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
on the field so defense isn't I wouldn't

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.770 
on the field so defense isn't I wouldn't
go<00:00:40.800> it's<00:00:41.579> good<00:00:41.760> i<00:00:41.790> think<00:00:43.640> you<00:00:44.640> know<00:00:44.700> i<00:00:44.789> think<00:00:44.940> in

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
go it's good i think you know i think in

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.569 
go it's good i think you know i think in
the<00:00:46.050> wisconsin<00:00:46.530> game<00:00:46.559> we<00:00:46.800> had<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:46.950> couple<00:00:47.160> along

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
the wisconsin game we had a couple along

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.549 
the wisconsin game we had a couple along
drives<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.120> we<00:00:48.180> all<00:00:48.270> said<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.510> couple<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:49.469> know

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
drives and we all said a couple you know

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.680 
drives and we all said a couple you know
short<00:00:49.860> ones<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.640> i<00:00:51.059> think<00:00:51.270> like<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.510> said

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
short ones and i think like you said

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.970 
short ones and i think like you said
with<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.930> team<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.260> has<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.410> good<00:00:52.620> offense

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
with the team that has a good offense

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.830 
with the team that has a good offense
you<00:00:53.940> know<00:00:54.059> it's<00:00:54.149> something<00:00:54.300> we<00:00:54.510> don't<00:00:54.629> really

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
you know it's something we don't really

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.479 
you know it's something we don't really
consciously<00:00:55.469> think<00:00:55.710> about<00:00:55.770> but<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.100> think<00:00:56.129> that

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
consciously think about but I think that

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.459 
consciously think about but I think that
it's<00:00:56.820> an<00:00:57.000> important<00:00:57.870> for<00:00:57.989> us<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.109> extend

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
it's an important for us to extend

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.220 
it's an important for us to extend

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.960 
really athletic that's what jumped out
and<00:04:14.080> watch<00:04:14.410> them<00:04:14.620> about<00:04:14.860> it<00:04:14.890> and<00:04:15.310> it<00:04:15.640> came<00:04:15.790> like

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
and watch them about it and it came like

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.430 
and watch them about it and it came like
this<00:04:16.030> is<00:04:16.390> time<00:04:16.630> of<00:04:16.660> possession<00:04:16.840> kind<00:04:17.320> of

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
this is time of possession kind of

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.780 
this is time of possession kind of
important<00:04:17.920> so<00:04:18.010> that<00:04:18.040> you<00:04:18.220> kind<00:04:18.370> of<00:04:18.489> keep<00:04:18.640> the

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
important so that you kind of keep the

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.360 
important so that you kind of keep the
ball<00:04:18.970> out<00:04:19.000> of<00:04:19.270> their<00:04:19.540> offices<00:04:20.170> hands<00:04:20.440> I<00:04:20.799> think

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
ball out of their offices hands I think

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.490 
ball out of their offices hands I think
that<00:04:21.400> will<00:04:21.640> be<00:04:21.910> a<00:04:22.060> factor<00:04:22.450> you<00:04:22.570> know<00:04:22.600> to<00:04:23.320> have<00:04:23.440> a

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
that will be a factor you know to have a

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.870 
that will be a factor you know to have a
high-powered<00:04:23.980> offense<00:04:24.340> you<00:04:24.490> know<00:04:24.520> a<00:04:24.640> real

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
high-powered offense you know a real

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.210 
high-powered offense you know a real
good<00:04:25.120> especially<00:04:25.930> running<00:04:26.320> game<00:04:26.470> but<00:04:26.680> I<00:04:26.890> think

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
good especially running game but I think

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.280 
good especially running game but I think
that<00:04:27.370> definitely<00:04:27.400> affect<00:04:28.060> over<00:04:28.360> against

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
that definitely affect over against

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.020 
that definitely affect over against

we'll<00:04:40.840> really<00:04:40.990> be<00:04:41.050> rolling<00:04:41.530> this<00:04:41.710> week<00:04:42.370> you<00:04:42.640> go

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
we'll really be rolling this week you go

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.210 
we'll really be rolling this week you go
that<00:04:42.970> way<00:04:43.320> they<00:04:44.320> really<00:04:44.590> can't<00:04:44.800> just<00:04:44.980> play<00:04:45.100> the

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
that way they really can't just play the

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.460 
that way they really can't just play the
pass<00:04:45.430> so<00:04:45.970> they<00:04:46.120> have<00:04:46.270> to<00:04:46.360> worry<00:04:46.540> about<00:04:46.690> both<00:04:47.050> so

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
pass so they have to worry about both so

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:48.870 
pass so they have to worry about both so
we<00:04:47.650> could<00:04:47.770> be<00:04:47.860> two<00:04:48.010> divisional<00:04:48.490> and<00:04:48.760> that

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
we could be two divisional and that

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.730 
we could be two divisional and that
makes<00:04:49.060> it<00:04:49.150> easier<00:04:49.300> on<00:04:49.600> all<00:04:49.750> of<00:04:49.780> us<00:04:49.960> what<00:04:50.560> would
