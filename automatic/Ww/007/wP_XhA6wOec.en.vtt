00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 what do you think if we are going to see work at 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:08.760
 a wonderful artist who marveled the 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.309
 the first time he went out to the whole world 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.250
 fascinated her we're going to see her work at 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:21.240
 current natal lady forward 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:23.820
 good way we tell you how 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.980
 the other time when Natalia came we continue 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.750
 here to offer you this job 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.330
 incredible that makes natalia that you 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.719
 learn this technique that is so difficult 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:37.290
 and nobody is explaining us very well 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.390
 so let 's date on the other hand if 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.219
 the eye we will perform in this 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.149
 opportunity a very important part in 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.399
 a face because the eye is what gives the 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.340
 expression to dragged her good in this 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.250
 case already has green gray eyes has 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.640
 a slightly a little bit strange tone 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.469
 it's like a turquoise has several shades 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.500
 if I in this case the first thing that 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.500
 use was a pretty strong green 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.740
 I do not use green and then I'm going to 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.780
 tell 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.729
 with your finger like we had done in another 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.930
 always the first layer opportunity 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:19.670
 he tried to adhere the back rows 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.009
 it is not so necessary to use the finger 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.600
 but the first one I always try to 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.689
 use it to adhere well 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.170
 then apply this green me what I'm going to 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:32.840
 apply is a natural sienna that is going to 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.610
 give that greenish hue that has 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.610
 it has like a greenish halo 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.340
 then I will apply and I will help 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.340
 with a zoom and not 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.900
 to pay a little for the green that was 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.900
 put previously 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:59.300
 then what I'm going to do is with a gray 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.850
 and start working the eye rim 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:05.100
 It is very important the drawing that makes the 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.560
 eye I always have to have 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.530
 careful to perform the details that I 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:14.100
 see in the eye I can start in a way 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.290
 loose making a bead quite like 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.850
 regular let's say but then I have to 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.650
 go into more detail and start to see the 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.600
 drawing that each eye is doing because 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.459
 all eyes are different and 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.160
 particular then I always have to 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.680
 go see as I go forward in 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.690
 the work that I draw making the eye 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.100
 that's what realism is going to give me 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.760
 then I will use a tone 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.040
 green dry and I will continue to work 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.960
 turning off that green that he had put 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.180
 previously 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.250
 I in this in this eye I also see 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.220
 some blue flashes then 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.020
 I will also go to put all the 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.120
 colors that I see I have to learn to 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.820
 observe well is a fundamental key 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.360
 to do everything that is realism the 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.360
 learn to observe 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.120
 Then I will apply 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.159
 and then with a celestial clarito 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.049
 I'm going to clarify a little everything 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:12.890
 I had worked as you see here I already 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.890
 I do not use my finger 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:19.170
 I use many times as the fomÃ­n or 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.000
 the same cake mixed with one another 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.260
 with the same product 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.340
 well then what I'm going to do 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.340
 is the pupil 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:37.790
 with black without fear he pressed and then with 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.099
 zoomed in and did not fix it here in a 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.709
 soldier because it would mess and pose he used the 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:44.900
 finger would mix everything then I have to 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:48.730
 use a female with the surplus that I 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:51.319
 it is black I will continue working 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.010
 that audio list that forms around 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.010
 of the iris 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.500
 and then also good I can follow 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:06.380
 using black in this case I use a 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.440
 softer black for the iris part 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:12.350
 because I need it to be very dark but 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.870
 then for the edges work the 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:18.049
 edges I'm going to use a harder black 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.090
 that will find varieties in the 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.700
 those that are harder more 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.950
 soft 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.580
 go know the material are going to go 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.580
 realizing 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:37.000
 then something very important is the light that 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:39.220
 here I use pure white 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.530
 and realized the light 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.060
 when I'm going to do what is the 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.160
 white of the eye that is not really 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.040
 white or is it wrongly called white 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.930
 because I will never use white but 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:53.290
 that I'm going to use a shade shade 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.960
 natural in this case if it comes right 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:58.660
 I 'm not going to use white 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.090
 because white I'm going to reserve it to give 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.980
 the flashes of light that the eye has if 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.040
 I use white for this sector that 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.720
 then I will not be able to give light then in 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.590
 this part more illuminated I will use 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:16.330
 a 100 to forgiveness or a natural shadow and in 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:21.629
 clarito and a toasted shadow 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.629
 for the part that is less illuminated 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.610
 let's not be afraid here to apply color 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:30.580
 because out there we have the 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.960
 conception that the white eye and gives us 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.919
 afraid to apply with the order actually 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.919
 I have to use 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:41.430
 pretty color in the eye then with the 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:44.910
 same shadow 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:48.040
 work above the eye I do not use the 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:50.820
 finger but he founded with the same cake 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:53.360
 blow to remove the excess 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:56.250
 and then with the gray I had used 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:59.169
 to make the rim of the eye 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:01.639
 I try to melt 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:03.800
 what would be the iris 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:06.939
 with the white part I can help 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.939
 also with our child 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.220
 this obviously at home they will 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.350
 work with more time and they will do it 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.660
 in greater detail 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:17.360
 but basically 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:21.050
 you work in this way then with the 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:23.539
 white pressing on 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:28.330
 the tan shadow that he had put on 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:28.330
 principle made the beam of light 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:35.120
 at the bottom and analyze the 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:36.680
 eyelashes that is the frame of the eye and that 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.259
 it will give you much more realism but 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.270
 basically this would be good for them 

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:43.280
 it looked beautiful it's not true, let's go 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:48.610
 to have a next class with natalia 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:48.610
 but for now we 're leaving and we 're going back
