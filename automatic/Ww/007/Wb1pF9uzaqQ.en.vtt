whiskers I thought I recorded this part
but<00:02:09.070> I<00:02:09.130> guess<00:02:09.369> I<00:02:09.519> didn't<00:02:09.880> but<00:02:10.119> you<00:02:10.329> guys<00:02:10.509> get

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
but I guess I didn't but you guys get

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.800 
but I guess I didn't but you guys get
the<00:02:10.840> point<00:02:11.049> you<00:02:11.400> can<00:02:12.400> also<00:02:12.700> use<00:02:13.090> colored<00:02:13.570> icing

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
the point you can also use colored icing

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.690 
the point you can also use colored icing
for<00:02:14.230> this<00:02:14.440> if<00:02:14.620> you<00:02:14.739> do<00:02:14.859> not<00:02:14.980> have<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.340> edible

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
for this if you do not have the edible

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.090 
for this if you do not have the edible
markers<00:02:16.120> or<00:02:16.750> you<00:02:16.930> can<00:02:17.140> just<00:02:17.380> use<00:02:17.530> black<00:02:17.829> and

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
markers or you can just use black and

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.830 
markers or you can just use black and
yellow<00:02:18.190> fondant<00:02:18.579> but<00:02:19.000> that<00:02:19.209> would<00:02:19.329> probably

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
yellow fondant but that would probably

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.810 
yellow fondant but that would probably
take<00:02:20.019> much<00:02:20.200> longer<00:02:20.380> to<00:02:20.739> do<00:02:20.920> but<00:02:21.250> it's<00:02:21.430> up<00:02:21.640> to

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
take much longer to do but it's up to

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.819
