end<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.850> last<00:00:36.000> year<00:00:36.329> using<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.110> 550<00:00:37.710> which<00:00:37.829> we

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
end the last year using the 550 which we

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.530 
end the last year using the 550 which we
thought<00:00:38.129> used<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.430> 550<00:00:39.030> will<00:00:39.180> be<00:00:39.270> obviously

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
thought used the 550 will be obviously

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.780 
thought used the 550 will be obviously
give<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.590> harder<00:00:40.860> time<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.250> more<00:00:41.370> abuse<00:00:41.670> so

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
give it a harder time and more abuse so

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.490 
give it a harder time and more abuse so
i<00:00:41.850> thought<00:00:41.969> i'd<00:00:42.180> be<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.300> option<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.600> go<00:00:42.840> we've

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
i thought i'd be the option to go we've

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.630 
i thought i'd be the option to go we've
got<00:00:43.590> robbed<00:00:43.770> ellesmere<00:00:44.219> with<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.430> lot<00:00:44.579> of

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
experience you jump on the bike and he's

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.229 
experience you jump on the bike and he's
just<00:00:46.829> got<00:00:47.039> better<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.430> better<00:00:47.550> better<00:00:48.000> and

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
just got better and better better and

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.369 
just got better and better better and
the<00:00:48.300> bike<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:48.629> actually<00:00:48.750> developed<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
the bike is actually developed the

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.569 
the bike is actually developed the
easier<00:00:49.620> than<00:00:49.770> we<00:00:49.860> thought<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.160> would<00:00:50.280> do<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.399> be

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
easier than we thought it would do to be

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.430 
easier than we thought it would do to be
honest<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.360> it's<00:00:51.600> obviously<00:00:52.140> going<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.350> be

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
honest and it's obviously going to be

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.470 
honest and it's obviously going to be
budget<00:00:52.800> racing<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.520> machine<00:00:53.820> itself<00:00:53.969> is

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
budget racing that the machine itself is

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.240 
budget racing that the machine itself is
absolutely<00:00:55.410> tiny<00:00:55.590> but<00:00:55.890> it's<00:00:56.010> going<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.160> be

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
absolutely tiny but it's going to be

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.950 
absolutely tiny but it's going to be
cheap<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.489> run<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.449> super<00:00:57.719> teams<00:00:57.899> are

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
cheap to run and the super teams are

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.790 
cheap to run and the super teams are
going<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.109> be<00:00:58.199> able<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.410> just<00:00:58.530> jump<00:00:58.739> straight

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
going to be able to just jump straight

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.979 
going to be able to just jump straight
on<00:00:59.160> yeah<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.760> idea<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.480> try<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.780> make<00:01:00.960> it

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
on yeah the idea is to try and make it

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.240 
on yeah the idea is to try and make it
as<00:01:01.109> affordable<00:01:01.170> as<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.800> doing<00:01:01.949> for<00:01:02.100> super

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
as affordable as you doing for super

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.219 
as affordable as you doing for super
teens<00:01:02.520> for<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.730> last<00:01:02.879> 14<00:01:03.239> years<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:03.750> yeah<00:01:04.019> a

biking in a better by progress on some

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.620 
biking in a better by progress on some
of<00:02:05.710> it<00:02:05.860> very<00:02:06.250> good<00:02:06.400> and<00:02:07.180> obviously<00:02:07.390> the

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
of it very good and obviously the

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.540 
of it very good and obviously the
aprilia<00:02:07.960> superteam<00:02:08.410> machine<00:02:08.800> itself<00:02:09.190> I<00:02:09.429> mean

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
aprilia superteam machine itself I mean

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:10.740 
aprilia superteam machine itself I mean
it's<00:02:09.700> got<00:02:09.849> pretty<00:02:10.090> much<00:02:10.330> similar<00:02:10.569> to

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
it's got pretty much similar to

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.170 
it's got pretty much similar to
suspension<00:02:11.349> on<00:02:11.470> this<00:02:11.620> one<00:02:11.890> so<00:02:12.340> it<00:02:12.730> must<00:02:13.000> be

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
suspension on this one so it must be

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.920 
suspension on this one so it must be
quite<00:02:13.360> an<00:02:13.510> easy<00:02:13.630> transition<00:02:13.989> to<00:02:14.410> me<00:02:14.530> oh<00:02:14.739> yeah

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
quite an easy transition to me oh yeah

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.960 
quite an easy transition to me oh yeah
coming<00:02:16.930> from<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:17.080> 125<00:02:17.500> on<00:02:17.709> to<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:17.920> 450<00:02:18.430> just

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
coming from the 125 on to the 450 just

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.580 
coming from the 125 on to the 450 just
so<00:02:19.120> much<00:02:19.180> easy<00:02:19.390> different<00:02:19.840> ends<00:02:20.050> exactly<00:02:20.530> the

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
so much easy different ends exactly the

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.620 
so much easy different ends exactly the
same<00:02:20.800> there<00:02:21.220> is<00:02:21.340> a<00:02:21.370> little<00:02:21.640> bit<00:02:21.730> softer<00:02:21.940> well

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
same there is a little bit softer well

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.570 
same there is a little bit softer well
that<00:02:22.750> can<00:02:22.870> be<00:02:22.900> tweaked<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:23.440> developed<00:02:24.340> as<00:02:24.430> it

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
that can be tweaked and developed as it

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.010 
that can be tweaked and developed as it
as<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.790> series<00:02:24.940> progresses<00:02:25.360> but<00:02:25.510> I<00:02:25.810> think

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
as the series progresses but I think

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.750 
as the series progresses but I think
you'll<00:02:26.110> be<00:02:26.230> very<00:02:26.260> good<00:02:26.500> series<00:02:26.709> thanks<00:02:27.640> man
