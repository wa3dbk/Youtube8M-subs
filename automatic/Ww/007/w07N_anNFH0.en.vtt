a<00:00:34.200> little<00:00:34.440> bit<00:00:34.710> faster<00:00:35.219> than<00:00:35.250> usual<00:00:43.100> trying<00:00:44.100> to

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
a little bit faster than usual trying to

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.060 
a little bit faster than usual trying to
put<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.820> purple<00:00:45.120> on<00:00:45.539> one<00:00:45.989> side<00:00:46.410> rather<00:00:46.860> than

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
put the purple on one side rather than

put the purple on one side rather than
on<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.700> bottom<00:00:50.329> so<00:00:51.329> these<00:00:51.660> are<00:00:51.930> my<00:00:53.360> obviously

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
on the bottom so these are my obviously

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.029 
on the bottom so these are my obviously
my<00:00:54.690> purple<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.350> ivory<00:00:57.379> cupcakes<00:00:58.379> orbs<00:00:58.800> from

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
my purple and ivory cupcakes orbs from

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:20.590 
my purple and ivory cupcakes orbs from
the<00:00:59.219> love<00:00:59.670> Purple's<00:01:00.270> red<00:01:06.350> can<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.380> smell<00:01:07.770> him

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.289 

it's<00:01:21.600> funny<00:01:21.960> because<00:01:22.430> this<00:01:23.430> fragments<00:01:24.150> I

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
it's funny because this fragments I

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.690 
it's funny because this fragments I
didn't<00:01:24.750> use<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:24.960> thicken<00:01:25.440> up<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:28.430> wonder<00:01:29.430> if

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
didn't use to thicken up I wonder if

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.270 
didn't use to thicken up I wonder if
it's<00:01:29.909> just<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.930> weather<00:01:31.200> at<00:01:31.470> this<00:01:31.680> time<00:01:32.070> you

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
it's just the weather at this time you

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.370 
it's just the weather at this time you
have<00:01:32.640> definitely<00:01:33.119> struggled<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.869> bit<00:01:33.900> more

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
have definitely struggled a bit more

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.660 
have definitely struggled a bit more
during<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.979> summer<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:36.200> before<00:01:37.670> obviously

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
during the summer and before obviously

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.550 
during the summer and before obviously
when<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.000> heard<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.420> sharp<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:40.080> was<00:01:40.259> at<00:01:40.409> work

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
when I heard the sharp I was at work

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.920 
when I heard the sharp I was at work
harder<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.460> only<00:01:41.790> made<00:01:42.180> soap<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.810> the

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
harder so I only made soap in the

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.310 
harder so I only made soap in the
evening<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.880> obviously<00:01:44.880> it's<00:01:45.509> cold<00:01:45.930> in<00:01:46.200> the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
evening and obviously it's cold in the

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.249 
evening and obviously it's cold in the
evening<00:01:46.350> in<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.009> UK<00:01:48.800> so<00:01:49.800> I'm<00:01:50.310> pretty<00:01:50.610> sure

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
evening in the UK so I'm pretty sure

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.230 
evening in the UK so I'm pretty sure
well<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.289> know<00:01:52.619> I'm<00:01:53.039> no<00:01:53.340> other<00:01:53.520> weather<00:01:53.729> makes<00:01:54.060> a

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
well I know I'm no other weather makes a

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.950 
well I know I'm no other weather makes a
difference

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
difference

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.830 
difference
it's<00:01:55.679> mad<00:01:56.070> really<00:01:56.490> isn't<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.330> think<00:01:57.630> that

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
it's mad really isn't it to think that

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.290 
it's mad really isn't it to think that
the<00:01:57.990> weather<00:01:58.229> will<00:01:58.740> make<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.009> difference<00:01:59.580> when

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
the weather will make a difference when

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:19.780 
the weather will make a difference when
you're<00:02:00.420> making<00:02:00.630> anything<00:02:03.920> it<00:02:04.920> certainly<00:02:05.399> does

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.369

quite<00:04:20.209> like<00:04:20.510> to<00:04:20.720> find<00:04:21.019> that<00:04:21.260> sent<00:04:22.780> one<00:04:23.780> that's

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
quite like to find that sent one that's

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.200 
quite like to find that sent one that's
identical<00:04:24.770> I<00:04:25.040> mean<00:04:25.340> there<00:04:25.490> were<00:04:25.580> lots<00:04:25.820> of<00:04:25.970> doob

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
identical I mean there were lots of doob

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.000 
identical I mean there were lots of doob
result<00:04:26.690> there<00:04:26.930> but<00:04:27.170> I<00:04:27.200> haven't<00:04:27.560> found<00:04:27.860> one

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
result there but I haven't found one

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:46.650 
result there but I haven't found one
that's<00:04:28.370> identical<00:04:29.120> to<00:04:29.300> the<00:04:29.570> body<00:04:29.780> shop<00:04:29.870> yes

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.200 

and<00:04:47.260> just<00:04:47.560> thinking<00:04:48.040> about<00:04:48.130> starting<00:04:48.880> to<00:04:49.000> put

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
and just thinking about starting to put

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.580 
and just thinking about starting to put
music<00:04:49.510> on<00:04:50.020> some<00:04:50.380> of<00:04:50.500> my<00:04:50.530> videos<00:04:50.650> because<00:04:52.590> I

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
music on some of my videos because I

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.910 
music on some of my videos because I
feel<00:04:54.340> like<00:04:54.550> I'm<00:04:54.760> saying<00:04:55.090> the<00:04:55.300> same<00:04:55.600> thing<00:04:56.020> I'm

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:56.920 
feel like I'm saying the same thing I'm

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.070 
feel like I'm saying the same thing I'm
offering<00:04:57.400> offering<00:04:57.670> over<00:04:58.240> and<00:04:58.360> over<00:04:58.540> and<00:04:58.840> over

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
offering offering over and over and over

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:22.170 
offering offering over and over and over
and<00:04:59.260> over<00:04:59.410> and<00:04:59.740> over<00:04:59.860> again<00:05:00.130> so<00:05:20.520> I'm<00:05:21.520> hoping<00:05:22.060> I

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
and over and over again so I'm hoping I

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:29.340 
and over and over again so I'm hoping I
can<00:05:22.210> get<00:05:22.540> to<00:05:22.750> the<00:05:22.900> end<00:05:23.140> of<00:05:26.490> get<00:05:27.490> all<00:05:27.640> this<00:05:27.940> in<00:05:28.350> in

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.350 
can get to the end of get all this in in

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.200 
can get to the end of get all this in in
this<00:05:29.710> video<00:05:30.190> and<00:05:31.020> then<00:05:32.250> the<00:05:33.250> next<00:05:33.640> step<00:05:33.910> will

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
this video and then the next step will

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:40.470 
this video and then the next step will
be<00:05:34.240> piping<00:05:38.280> just<00:05:39.280> getting<00:05:39.700> every<00:05:39.970> little<00:05:40.270> last

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:40.480 
be piping just getting every little last

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:51.540 
be piping just getting every little last
scrap<00:05:40.960> of<00:05:41.340> the<00:05:42.810> the<00:05:43.810> dish

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.029 

it's<00:05:52.550> much<00:05:53.090> quicker<00:05:53.509> just<00:05:53.960> to<00:05:54.139> do<00:05:54.320> a<00:05:54.350> double

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039 
it's much quicker just to do a double

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:57.400 
it's much quicker just to do a double
core<00:05:55.490> but<00:05:55.880> as<00:05:56.060> you<00:05:56.330> can<00:05:56.479> see<00:05:56.720> this<00:05:56.960> has<00:05:57.139> got

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
core but as you can see this has got

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:02.550 
core but as you can see this has got
gotten<00:05:57.949> far<00:05:58.220> too<00:05:58.490> thick<00:05:58.880> to<00:05:59.090> do<00:05:59.270> a<00:05:59.300> double<00:05:59.990> par

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.860 

you've<00:06:03.560> got<00:06:03.800> to<00:06:04.009> put<00:06:04.250> it<00:06:04.430> down<00:06:04.539> quite<00:06:05.539> well

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:05.870 
you've got to put it down quite well

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:14.560 
you've got to put it down quite well
like<00:06:06.229> that<00:06:11.979> otherwise<00:06:12.979> you<00:06:13.400> get<00:06:13.610> sick<00:06:14.150> well

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:14.570 
like that otherwise you get sick well

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.020 
like that otherwise you get sick well
they<00:06:14.870> probably<00:06:15.110> will<00:06:15.650> still<00:06:16.009> be<00:06:16.250> some<00:06:16.550> seams

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.030 
they probably will still be some seams

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:35.189 
they probably will still be some seams
in<00:06:17.360> these<00:06:18.009> when<00:06:19.009> we<00:06:19.250> unmold

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:35.199 

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:38.429 

it's<00:06:35.770> also<00:06:36.159> hard<00:06:36.849> to<00:06:36.999> talk<00:06:37.419> and<00:06:37.719> work<00:06:37.900> at<00:06:38.319> the
