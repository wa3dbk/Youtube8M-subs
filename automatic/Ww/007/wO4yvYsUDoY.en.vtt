 Turing in the second compartment of the buffer ces Cho dozen companies 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:29.980
 The basic insole is included, so it is easier to use 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.309
 In the Lazy control, 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.090
 Well be able to provide some material that gives you the ability to do so 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:38.530
 I'll ask you. 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:43.559
 4 Now that the previous part is just another 4 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:48.940
 At once to a ditch and then this air is now some examples to cover mesh merry 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:50.680
 Something like this in the environment is something like that. 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.520

 And a little house key part is the part indeyo to flex and control 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:05.790
 It 's the material that moves like a tire. 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:09.930
 So it gives us a lot of support but it's not supported. 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:14.460
 That's why it's a bit inconvenient for a bridge to break down . 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:19.229
 I think you can solve English and 4 of the material comfort that object more particularly Card 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.299

 It can be done for any purpose. 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:30.810
 Or the hair on your arms may be a little less flexible , 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:34.649
 In the case of a falling foot, it also emphasizes a little cushion like that. 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.950
 If the bridge itself, such grid resources, 18 are used for walking or materials 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:40.580
 Handmade adopt more stable 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:45.530

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:51.050
 This is the same breathtaking face that contains a bad breath in the chest 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:55.340
 I have this flex for a little exercise , 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.570
 In the case of people who are more solid and slightly flattened in the morning, such as the lower ones 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.900
 This is how it is used 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:04.220
 Ready-made custom yiraseo was cheering the altar 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:06.860
