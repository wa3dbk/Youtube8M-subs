those<00:01:37.380> potions<00:01:37.799> happening<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:38.610> think<00:01:39.000> this<00:01:39.060> mud

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
those potions happening I think this mud

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.780 
those potions happening I think this mud
is<00:01:39.360> doesn't<00:01:40.140> work<00:01:40.409> too<00:01:40.680> well<00:01:40.710> with<00:01:41.070> potions<00:01:41.340> I

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
is doesn't work too well with potions I

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.480 
is doesn't work too well with potions I
think<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.360> gobbled<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.869> up<00:01:42.990> maybe<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:44.009> sorts

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
think it gobbled it up maybe of sorts

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.429 
think it gobbled it up maybe of sorts
