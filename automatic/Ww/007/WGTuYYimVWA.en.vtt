00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.049
 for fc marlène closeup.nl 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.880

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.130
 Noord-Holland visiting FC quay 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.699

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.890
 Premier League 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.869
 and so this competition can rightfully be one 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.730
 topper 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.060
 fck de hommel reached the 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.699
 cup final and is close by and 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.500
 Play or place on four points 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.450

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.190
 to the play-offs in the premier league 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:41.730
 excellent action from el allouchi 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.940
 and a nice shot from najib el allouchi 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.070
 there would not be tears at marlouchi and 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.820
 is that hamdaoui missing the first two 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.399
 to be 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.690
 beautiful injured two and there is 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.600
 the opening goal 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.550
 splendid a two arda havar and 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.100
 youness hadouir 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.980
 involved in those one two and arda havar 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.550
 after 5 minutes he fck the bumblebee 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.550
 row 0 ahead 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.560
 the hardworking 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.840
 zakaria amrani ambra that is not but it is 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.479
 roskam and then it's court camp that 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.310
 is close to his 21st goal this season 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.049
 in the premier division 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.759
 the leader therefore did not lose any 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.900
 away game 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.880
 but must hunt for the 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:29.939
 equalizer and the hair then comes 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.549
 arda havar close to its second goal 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.680
 good action from peter rozenbeek that good 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.930
 keep looking at the shore 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.240
 again the fck is the bumblebee 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.200
 fc marlène tries to get out of the tent 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.850
 to lure 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.700
 that is not entirely possible with hofkamp and 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.030
 the leg of malawi 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.030
 the keeper 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.310
 game resumption and from that 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.240
 game resumption is again el allouchi 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.240
 and then it is 2 0 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:03.810
 yes the team of piet gabrian johan 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.510
 marche in the home match 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.330
 here in the mesh gate on a 2 0 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:12.530
 lead and worrying look of 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.530
 attention jagdewsing 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.640
 he must miss some players here 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.610
 for costs and what felsbourg are 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:25.260
 injured and almost 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:28.670
 the week zero a huge opportunity for March 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.080
 the clutter and three zero would be one 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.170
 fantastic after rio are for fck de 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.170
 bumblebee 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.680
 continues to attack in the team 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.850
 wheel is there may be cookie supplier and 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.870
 her for her 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:49.530
 and there he is the 3 0 richard sala 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:52.320
 on stating arda havar in a good one 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:57.380
 match plays arbor for fck de 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.380
 bumblebee long ball nice assumption 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.230
 they have to defend modern but yes there 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.819
 is the fourth 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.819
 arda havar he makes a second one 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:12.129
 and therefore the 4 0 for fck the bumblebee flat 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:16.769
 before the break with 12 seconds left on the clock 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:16.769
 it is 4 0 for fck de hommel 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.280
 And then it appears that there is for the team 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.080
 from anti-aging 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.640
 not very much to get in the 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.760
 mesh gate 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.250
 the rest position of four zero and then must 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.569
 FC Marlène hunting for goals in 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.049
 the second half 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.430
 court camp and a very nice shot of 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:39.010
 sander the black 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.620
 March Allah who is on his post 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:45.099
 mild black 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:48.310
 good ball in the width of the neck and back 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:49.480
 is court camp there and you know it just now 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.160
 to be found 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.459
 goal number 21 for him in the 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.459
 Premier League 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.010
 but then there is fck the drone again 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.290
 and so large ones do arise 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.349
 options for example this one 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.750
 youness hadouir her pink stream stands 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:13.440
 not for nothing 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.440
 he stays here one 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:22.360
 rozebeke and hadouir a leading role for and 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:26.349
 court camp and this is good 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:29.229
 amrani hofkamp and oh yes hi name is the 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:32.020
 wijdenbosch the ball and therefore the chance to 4 2 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:33.639
 and they look modern there 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.289
 of course always excellent for 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.820
 the Premier League 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:38.680
 even with a defeat it remains the 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.210
 leader 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.849
 the goalkeeper has now finished his pink cup 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.220
 if the ball is with them they will get there 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:48.880
 through it's sander's goal 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.200
 black and then the margins are only 2 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.870
 so has the insertion of an extra 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.870
 play field in possession of the ball at half of 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:59.560
 the opponent their effect but then 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.240
 is rozenbeek in the goal fc again 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.760
 Marlene could not work the ball away and 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:08.470
 it is then picked up by 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:11.690
 hisham sala 5 2 for fck the bumblebee 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:14.780
 look here again well where is the ball 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:17.110
 it then comes before the feet of isam 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.110
 sala 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.140
 and if it touches again 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.090
 10 seconds after sander's goal 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.770
 black 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.440
 fc marlène will not leave it at that 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:30.080
 but then this distance shot it's arda 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.300
 havar with a nice final chord of 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.750
 this match his distance shot 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:38.740
 sets the final score at 6 2 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.740
 for fck de hommel
