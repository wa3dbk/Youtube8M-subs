00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 well let's park in double 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.540
 curb 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.540
 left on line 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.400
 well as you will see is double curb 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.170
 and you have to realize that the 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.330
 back stove can be raised very 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.119
 easily when trying to upload the first 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.849
 curbstone then what we really go 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.739
 to do is lower the mirror lower the 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.050
 mirror to see the curb that the 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:33.660
 curb is going up 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.730
 and that's how you realize that you're not going to 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.730
 go up on the sidewalk beck starts 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.559
 and that you see the wheel 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.559
 that you see the wheel 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.600
 you can lower it all the way down and 

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:50.600
 see the wheel 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.580
 and you push it in, that is, the 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.120
 lower down and you and now you lower it to 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:02.780
 that you see your wheel and understood 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.780
 we started the parking 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:19.120
 well peeking you'll see that it's going up 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.120
 you see the first curb 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.940
 and when exactly it sent 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.940
 rectifying 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.520
 and now very slowly you'll see that it's going to 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.760
 go approaching the wheel you see 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.920
 perfectly and you see when you are going to play 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.759
 The curb 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:47.080
 ss ss there has not touched you realize 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.080
 come then follow if you have not touched 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:58.310
 and you see there you realize it's already playing 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:02.110
 If you see it perfectly because now 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.110
 You know you will not get on the curb 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:19.640
 look back to the back 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.640
 that's 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.810
 ah 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:26.629
 behind 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.570
 let's see what is happening in the 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.230
 curbstone then it is clear if you are 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:38.190
 seeing that he is entering and placing himself 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.190
 the first look 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:45.740
 there it is and now the one of bezas and you already have 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:47.950
 the car parked on right and now 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.950
 is 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:54.320
 Well now let's place the 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.120
 mirror because you can not start 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:00.480
 because when you give it up for you 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.490
 is going to tell you to come out and you can not leave 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.740
 the placement of the mirror later because 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.470
 you will not remember it is very important 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:10.620
 that you put it when you're going to give 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.470
 finished we put brake dead center 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:17.000
 hand and we say to the examiner 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.000
 that is already finished
