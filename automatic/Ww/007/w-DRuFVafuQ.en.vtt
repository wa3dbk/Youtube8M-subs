00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:47.029 
push bump right here might give it away

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:49.059

long<00:05:03.939> but<00:05:05.199> again<00:05:06.199> like<00:05:06.740> I<00:05:06.800> said<00:05:06.979> you<00:05:07.159> had<00:05:07.669> other

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:07.849 
long but again like I said you had other

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:10.059 
long but again like I said you had other
cars<00:05:08.120> built<00:05:08.389> from<00:05:08.569> me<00:05:08.719> as<00:05:09.590> you<00:05:09.740> know<00:05:09.860> they're
