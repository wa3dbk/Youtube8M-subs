00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.760
 territorial ordering a tool 

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:06.850
 for the sustainable use of 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.250
 natural resources 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.410
 for many years the territory 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.900
 Peru has been occupying itself under the 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.209
 logic to get the most out of the 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.340
 natural resources causing 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.440
 some cases negative impacts on 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.020
 ecosystems and in the productive base of 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:26.200
 country also generating processes 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:29.170
 unbalanced and excluding 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.850
 this is mainly due to a lack 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.880
 of articulation between policies 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.890
 regional and local nationals with 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.080
 territorial incidence and lack 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.630
 of a shared vision of criteria 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.850
 Strategic balanced and sustainable 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.650
 to avoid these situations is 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.990
 It is necessary to promote mechanisms that 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.190
 allow to have the conditions 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:52.310
 necessary for a development 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.620
 balanced and secure territory 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.690
 is the territory we understand the 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.540
 territory as the space that comprises 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.250
 the soil the subsoil the maritime domain 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.050
 and the airspace in which it 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.780
 they develop social relationships 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.150
 political and cultural differences between 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.460
 people and the natural environment in a 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.740
 legal and institutional framework and in which 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.479
 converge interests identities and 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.310
 cultures of populations with the 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.619
 purpose of taking advantage of resources 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.760
 to provide quality of life and wellbeing 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.190
 to the people 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.530
 then how is it guaranteed that all 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.930
 take advantage and enjoy balanced and 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.630
 sustainably from a territory to 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.180
 through territorial ordering 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.799
 what is the territorial ordering is a 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.930
 political and technical process 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.700
 administrative staff to guide the 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.340
 orderly occupation and sustainable use 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.259
 the territory on the basis of 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.570
 identification of potentials and 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.450
 limitations considering criteria 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.280
 socio-cultural environmental 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.679
 institutional ordering 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.390
 territorial at no time assigns or 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:57.240
 excludes the different uses of 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.329
 territory who intervene in the 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.399
 territorial ordering processes 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.319
 territorial ordering competition is 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.990
 a shared function with governments 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:09.119
 regional and local areas, it is advisable 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.920
 that the subnational levels articulate 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.440
 and coordinate with each other and with the level 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.819
 national development and approval of 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.920
 technical instruments 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.540
 territorial ordering taking into 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.340
 account the policies and guidelines 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.319
 defined by the ministry of the environment 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.359
 as the governing body 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.340
 according to the regulatory framework of 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:29.139
 territorial organization the ministry 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.329
 of the environment issues the technical opinion 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:33.519
 favorable to the request of the region a 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:35.680
 municipality as the case may be with what 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.569
 which ensures that the instruments 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.150
 technicians have been developed from 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.769
 according to the established methodology and 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.579
 that public resources have been 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.579
 used properly 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.960
 in the case of local governments it is 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.000
 previous favorable opinion of the government 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.000
 regional and the ministry of the plane 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.689
 how the process of 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.230
 territorial order according to the 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:04.239
 ministerial resolution number 135 2013 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.069
 mine the ordering process 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.400
 territorial starts with the formulation 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:11.500
 of the following technical instruments 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.930
 ecological and economic zoning 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.939
 ecological and economic zoning is a 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.430
 technical characterization instrument 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:20.859
 of mainly physical aspects and 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.170
 biological of the territory does not restrict 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:25.120
 uses in the territory but proposes 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.340
 alternatives of use and reaches 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.319
 technical considerations in order to 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.659
 manage the impact they can generate 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.849
 some activities making them more 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:36.190
 profitable and contributing to the decline 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:39.100
 of conflicts 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.900
 specialized studies are instruments 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.760
 technicians of a strategic nature that 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.340
 generate information about the dynamics 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.290
 and the functionality of the territory to 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.690
 from information generated in the 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.220
 ecological and economic zoning 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.960
 these studies describe the 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.910
 characteristics and conditions of 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.610
 configuration and current dynamics of 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:00.100
 integrated diagnostic territory of 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.530
 territory the integrated diagnosis of 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.480
 territory is a technical instrument that 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.280
 complements integrates and analyzes the 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.320
 ecological zoning information 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.140
 and economic and the studies 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.640
 specialized establishes the set of 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.500
 favorable and unfavorable conditions 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.060
 that will serve as input for the 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.519
 preparation of the ordering plan 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.980
 territorial ordering plan 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.440
 territorial the ordering plan 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.030
 territorial is a technical instrument 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.580
 support that guides the 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.350
 planning and territory management 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.780
 for its use and occupation 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.340
 sustainable way thanks to the plan of 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.830
 territorial ordering can be 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.840
 link the ordering process 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.610
 with other plans and instruments 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.460
 related to land management 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.410
 and of development which are 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.180
 addressed by other sectors and levels 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.430
 of government in the framework of its 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.710
 competencies and functions with 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.020
 territorial ordering we can achieve 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.150
 build a shared vision of 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.130
 development and obtain information for 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.500
 making decisions about actions in the 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.810
 territory maintain the balance of the 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.510
 ecosystems the use 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.400
 sustainable use of natural resources 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.940
 greater opportunities for development and 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.530
 competitiveness with territorial approach 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.930
 profitability of investments in terms 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.520
 social and environmental issues reduce 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.710
 marginality and the conditions of 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.830
 poverty and reduce the conditions of 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.830
 vulnerability
