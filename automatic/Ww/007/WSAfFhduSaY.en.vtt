so<00:00:01.260> if<00:00:01.380> you're<00:00:01.469> watching<00:00:01.620> this<00:00:01.860> you<00:00:02.370> couldn't

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
so if you're watching this you couldn't

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.230 
so if you're watching this you couldn't
get<00:00:02.790> part<00:00:03.000> one<00:00:03.120> to<00:00:03.240> work<00:00:03.389> or<00:00:04.940> you<00:00:05.940> just<00:00:06.120> came

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
get part one to work or you just came

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.190 
get part one to work or you just came
back<00:00:06.299> from<00:00:06.480> part<00:00:06.720> one<00:00:06.839> so<00:00:08.840> if<00:00:09.840> your<00:00:10.050> router

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
back from part one so if your router

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.049 
back from part one so if your router
doesn't<00:00:10.500> have<00:00:10.650> this<00:00:10.769> on<00:00:10.950> default<00:00:11.309> then<00:00:11.759> you

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
doesn't have this on default then you

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.669 
doesn't have this on default then you
have<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.300> change<00:00:12.450> some<00:00:12.750> of<00:00:12.780> these<00:00:12.900> things<00:00:12.960> I'm

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
have to change some of these things I'm

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.650 
have to change some of these things I'm
can't<00:00:14.070> guarantee<00:00:14.460> it'll<00:00:14.639> work<00:00:14.700> if<00:00:15.089> you<00:00:15.179> were

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
can't guarantee it'll work if you were

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.960 
can't guarantee it'll work if you were
having<00:00:15.900> troubles<00:00:16.320> but<00:00:17.160> it<00:00:17.310> could<00:00:17.520> work<00:00:17.699> for

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
having troubles but it could work for

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.730 
having troubles but it could work for
some<00:00:18.119> of<00:00:18.210> you<00:00:18.359> so<00:00:20.960> first<00:00:21.960> thing<00:00:22.109> go<00:00:22.529> down<00:00:22.680> a

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
some of you so first thing go down a

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.400 
some of you so first thing go down a
firewall<00:00:23.250> settings<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:23.850> where<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:24.689> says<00:00:24.810> UDP

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
firewall settings and where it says UDP

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.259 
firewall settings and where it says UDP

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
endpoint filtering and TCP endpoint

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.120 
endpoint filtering and TCP endpoint
filtering<00:00:27.660> check<00:00:28.080> address<00:00:28.560> restricted

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
filtering check address restricted

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.600 
filtering check address restricted
sometimes<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.359> automatically<00:00:31.320> set<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.800> port

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
sometimes I automatically set to port

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.700 
sometimes I automatically set to port
and<00:00:32.850> address<00:00:33.390> restricted<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.350> can<00:00:34.500> strip

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
and address restricted so you can strip

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.319 
and address restricted so you can strip
the<00:00:34.860> port<00:00:35.100> obviously<00:00:35.579> people<00:00:35.850> can't<00:00:36.059> connect

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
the port obviously people can't connect

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.060 
the port obviously people can't connect
to<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.510> port<00:00:37.520> after<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.760> do<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:38.879> go<00:00:40.070> down

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
to that port after you do that go down

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.580

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
for you to connect you go to multiplayer

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.550 
for you to connect you go to multiplayer
and<00:01:58.990> type<00:01:59.990> in<00:02:00.760> localhost<00:02:01.760> all<00:02:02.660> one<00:02:03.050> word<00:02:03.230> and

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
and type in localhost all one word and

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:16.510 
and type in localhost all one word and
connect

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.820 

this<00:02:17.120> is<00:02:17.270> bucket<00:02:17.660> by<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:17.840> way<00:02:18.020> but<00:02:18.590> it<00:02:18.680> should

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
this is bucket by the way but it should

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:41.000 
this is bucket by the way but it should
work<00:02:18.950> with<00:02:19.190> I<00:02:19.570> call<00:02:20.570> me<00:02:20.660> load<00:02:20.870> up<00:02:23.410> or<00:02:24.410> is<00:02:24.740> it

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.550 

so<00:02:41.550> if<00:02:41.610> you're<00:02:41.760> running<00:02:41.970> off<00:02:42.060> this<00:02:43.819> just<00:02:44.819> go<00:02:45.000> to

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
so if you're running off this just go to

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:53.199 
so if you're running off this just go to
multiplayer<00:02:46.560> localhost<00:02:47.340> and<00:02:47.549> connect

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209
