00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.619
 Y 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.619
 Y 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.579
 Welcome to the section with your self 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.520
 do it yourself the guitar on the rocks 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:43.340
 puntocom today we are going to see a solution 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.430
 for a problem quite common in the 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:50.110
 mid-range and range acoustic guitars 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:52.540
 low is the problem of tuning 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:56.320
 in this guitar we have a small 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.060
 The guitar is tuned well in its 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.540
 strings to air we will check 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.540
 now 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.690
 Y 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.680
 but when we play notes in the 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.480
 different frets we see that they are a 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.220
 little sharper than it should the 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:21.190
 problem in this guitar is very 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.190
 accented on the rope 2 then 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.970
 perfect 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.820
 they are sharp 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.860
 this happens 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.260
 also on the other strings in major or 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.740
 lesser measure 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.740
 single 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.590
 but according to the dishes some 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:55.830
 but then there has slowly the 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.830
 when in rope we are going to check 

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:07.630
 there is a small lag as you can see 

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:09.310
 this seems to be something not very serious 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.690
 because the lag is very small in 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.000
 other guitars is a bit more 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.000
 accented is hardly noticeable 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.310
 yes 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.290
 certain denomination especially if 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.910
 We have been donating a lot of time 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.800
 guitar or an instrument we're going to 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.920
 notice because our ear is already a 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.959
 little prepared and a little done to the sound 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.120
 that should have a good guitar 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.120
 tuned the possible solutions that 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.400
 we can find online or that we 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.600
 can suggest friends or people who 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.910
 works in music stores are a bit 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.740
 hard for the grain half of the change of 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.220
 frets of the location change of 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:01.740
 I am going to give you a very 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.570
 easy very economical and that will make you 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.700
 the guitar has a tuning of 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.630
 professional guitar even if it's a 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.630
 not very expensive model 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:15.400
 put a little piece like this 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.170
 so that the rope can support when 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.700
 we press it instead of being supported 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.740
 fair determined in plays 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.710
 it was a little bit more towards 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:29.180
 this seems like a solution it seems that 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.400
 it's not a solution it seems 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.659
 it works 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:38.360
 the important thing is to know at what distance 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:41.260
 you have to support the rope and shorten a 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.209
 little distance from the rope 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.860
 respect to the first fret but where 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.079
 exactly that is what we have to 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.540
 try slowly and with a little 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:52.060
 patience and moving it is little piece 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.519
 that we can easily do by moving it 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.000
 and when we see that the thin rope well 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:59.880
 there we have the measure 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.180
 then they try to make a little piece that 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.580
 is stuck to lance plays and what to do 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.680
 that the rope to its optimum point of 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.230
 tuning how do we get that one 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.420
 rope be more towards the fret support 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:16.680
 towards the freest furthest closer to 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:19.829
 make a very aesthetic solution 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:23.100
 and very easy to visually do everything 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.570
 from the same great cool thickness of the 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.490
 same 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.990
 in what would be the sixth string in what 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.990
 that would be the first 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.270
 but they are recesses with which the 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.240
 base where the rope rests occupies everything 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.250
 the width 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.860
 and on other strings and I made a recess 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.080
 with the file carefully with a file of 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.479
 marquetry that you can find in a 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.509
 Lots of shops in reduced April 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:51.110
 because because the rope when it supports does not 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:54.020
 is going to be fair 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:57.440
 where the bone ends but it must be 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.630
 lowered on the rope over here 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.580
 It would be the rope that decides what 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.590
 I made the bone 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.800
 maybe remember that when we click 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.569
 the finger to support here in other 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.389
 ropes needed more distance 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:13.069
 respect to the makes plays then there not 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:14.350
 in him they are recesses in the request appointment of 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:17.190
 is 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:20.210
 whereupon the rope when we work 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:22.520
 will support here 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.840
 what do we get with this let's see the 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.840
 problem that has the function 

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:34.719
 s 

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:46.039
 I know you have to say that with a 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:48.849
 minimum investment we can make a piece 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:48.849
 like this one 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:56.780
 will solve that problem the 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:59.360
 we put in here for near the fret 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.070
 because there is greater distance from the rope 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.780
 of the fingerboard for which I have done 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:09.000
 finite so that it fits perfectly 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:11.870
 then we carry until the makes plays 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.870
 there it is stuck 

00:06:12.549 --> 00:06:18.739
 the good thing would be that this with white glue 

00:06:15.769 --> 00:06:20.229
 or with whatever we see the part 

00:06:18.739 --> 00:06:23.899
 this one here 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:25.909
 and with the outside to be fixed and not 

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:28.999
 to vibrations spoken on the strings 

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:31.860
 you never want it to the fingerboard because 

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:35.340
 you always want to take it away for something 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.990
 and maybe he can suffer then we stick it 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.320
 we have a little tail with the 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:42.470
 strings removed and 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:45.470
 we would join the piece we can even 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:47.210
 remove times play paste it remove the 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:49.780
 strings remove the nut we paste the 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:51.970
 piece and we put back 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:54.160
 because I have hit by what I say to you 

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:58.290
 that there are no gaps do not move this 

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.290
 piece and there are no strange vibrations 

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.220
 do not 

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:10.490
 Y 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:13.160
 once we have the strings tuned 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:16.610
 to the air we can verify that thanks to 

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:18.880
 this solution the problem of the 

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.880
 tuning 

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:23.430
 do not 

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:27.460
 Y 

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.310
 it has disappeared 

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:38.430
 amazing 

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:40.710
 but pure physics everything perfect if it's not 

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:43.620
 perfect is that we have to go back to 

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:48.170
 correct a little bit the distance but 

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:51.630
 with very little time very little effort or 

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:53.100
 a little the calculations we can get 

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:57.470
 that a guitar that used to give us 

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:57.470
 problems be perfect
