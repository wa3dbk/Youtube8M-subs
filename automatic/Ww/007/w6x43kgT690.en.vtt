00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
like the I don't know back then my other

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.390 
like the I don't know back then my other
kids<00:03:39.880> had<00:03:40.209> the<00:03:40.450> Gerber<00:03:41.140> teething<00:03:41.890> biscuits

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
kids had the Gerber teething biscuits

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.030 
kids had the Gerber teething biscuits
and<00:03:42.640> they<00:03:42.850> get<00:03:43.030> so<00:03:43.209> machine<00:03:43.630> goes<00:03:43.930> these<00:03:44.770> don't

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
and they get so machine goes these don't

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.400 
and they get so machine goes these don't
really<00:03:45.370> get<00:03:45.520> like<00:03:45.580> that<00:03:46.030> so<00:03:46.690> that's<00:03:47.020> a<00:03:47.230> good

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
really get like that so that's a good

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.620 
really get like that so that's a good
thing<00:03:47.730> but<00:03:48.730> I<00:03:48.940> think<00:03:49.000> that<00:03:49.870> I<00:03:50.430> am<00:03:51.430> NOT<00:03:52.330> because

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
thing but I think that I am NOT because

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:53.820 
thing but I think that I am NOT because
of<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:52.870> ingredients<00:03:53.440> because<00:03:53.650> the

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
of the ingredients because the

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:54.990 
of the ingredients because the
ingredients<00:03:54.459> are<00:03:54.550> set<00:03:54.790> for<00:03:54.970> a

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
ingredients are set for a

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.229 
ingredients are set for a
seven-month-old<00:03:55.600> but<00:03:56.440> just<00:03:56.680> because<00:03:57.250> of<00:03:57.580> his

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
seven-month-old but just because of his

00:03:58.239 --> 00:03:59.850 
seven-month-old but just because of his
teeth<00:03:58.600> and<00:03:58.840> he<00:03:58.959> already<00:03:59.140> knows<00:03:59.380> how<00:03:59.500> to<00:03:59.530> bite

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
teeth and he already knows how to bite

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.949 
teeth and he already knows how to bite
