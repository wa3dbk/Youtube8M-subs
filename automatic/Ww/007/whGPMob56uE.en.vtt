00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
clay into triangle it doesn't have to be

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.580 
clay into triangle it doesn't have to be
exact<00:00:40.920> because<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.340> can<00:00:41.460> always<00:00:41.670> fix<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.210> up

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
to make it as realistic as possible i

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.570 
to make it as realistic as possible i
would<00:02:05.969> add<00:02:06.329> you<00:02:06.990> know<00:02:07.140> like<00:02:07.500> shades<00:02:07.950> of<00:02:08.250> red
