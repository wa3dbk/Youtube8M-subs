00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.250
 Hello everyone, let's imagine that 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.560
 initially we got this 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.840
 here's a frame that is dark enough and not 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.610
 quite right on the white balance because 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.219
 it should be a little warmer 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.450
 Well, try to do something with it 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.450
 less worthwhile 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:25.830
 first we have a little frame made with and fairy 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.800
 i.e. will even on exposure and 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.050
 Now we clearly see that we have blue up 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.580
 turned cold goats we became 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.559
 wrong all the cutter like balance 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.220
 white now we can fix it 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.640
 lightroom 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.640
 and get a true warm snapshot 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.040
 probably so here will be enough 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.239
 maybe even a little bit to play with 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:58.080
 shade 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.470
 so that is to say, we have already received much more 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.050
 good shot 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:05.260
 what else can we do we can do 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:09.640
 darkening at the edges of the frame, that is, no 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:14.160
 to enhance attention to our facility on 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.160
 our center marks that is put on 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.140
 if somewhere wrong we can allow 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.740
 Taksimo versus improvement is bad 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.740
 make some more improvements 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:44.370
 for example now I work separate with 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:47.600
 shadows and separately light areas 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:50.250
 to give visually a contrast and 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.770
 Now I see that I need more of these. 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.110
 positions and we can add perfectly for 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.150
 skin is better 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:01.490
 what else can i do in principle 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:05.090
 make the series in the background more 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.090
 beautiful interesting 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:13.640
 well and a little bit you can add 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.040
 saturation that's so good let's 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.620
 let's see what we have I will do 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.310
 another snapshot you author it 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.460
 after 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:28.220
 and now we look dashing what was before and 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:30.830
 car what has become completely our retouching 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.310
 lightroom which took us no more 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.310
 two minutes
