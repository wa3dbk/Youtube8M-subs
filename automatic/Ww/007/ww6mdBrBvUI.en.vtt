and<00:00:03.090> this<00:00:03.270> is<00:00:03.389> the<00:00:03.510> ghost<00:00:03.689> note<00:00:03.929> Pro<00:00:04.549> so<00:00:05.549> the

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
and this is the ghost note Pro so the

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:06.980 
and this is the ghost note Pro so the
ghost<00:00:05.819> note<00:00:06.000> pro<00:00:06.180> was<00:00:06.330> something<00:00:06.660> that<00:00:06.690> I<00:00:06.870> came

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
ghost note pro was something that I came

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.450 
ghost note pro was something that I came
up<00:00:07.319> with<00:00:07.350> a<00:00:07.500> concept<00:00:07.770> that<00:00:08.040> I<00:00:08.130> came<00:00:08.280> up<00:00:08.340> with

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
up with a concept that I came up with

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.459 
up with a concept that I came up with
after<00:00:08.760> being<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.179> private<00:00:09.690> drum<00:00:10.050> instructor<00:00:10.410> I

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
after being a private drum instructor I

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:11.600 
after being a private drum instructor I
was<00:00:10.500> spending<00:00:10.830> so<00:00:10.980> much<00:00:11.099> time<00:00:11.130> with<00:00:11.340> my

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
was spending so much time with my

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.419 
was spending so much time with my
students<00:00:12.059> trying<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:12.809> get<00:00:12.960> their<00:00:13.139> dynamics<00:00:13.799> to

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
students trying to get their dynamics to

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.400 
students trying to get their dynamics to
to<00:00:14.820> really<00:00:15.059> come<00:00:15.420> down<00:00:15.450> in<00:00:15.839> volume<00:00:16.109> get<00:00:16.260> that

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
to really come down in volume get that

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.260 
to really come down in volume get that
left<00:00:16.680> hand<00:00:16.980> for<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.220> ghost<00:00:17.430> notes<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.820> really

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
left hand for the ghost notes to really

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.570 
left hand for the ghost notes to really
be<00:00:18.359> quiet<00:00:18.630> in<00:00:18.750> volume<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.230> it<00:00:19.710> occurred<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.490> me

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
be quiet in volume and it occurred to me

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.040 
be quiet in volume and it occurred to me
that<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:20.760> needed<00:00:21.060> their<00:00:21.300> strokes<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.960> be

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
that I needed their strokes to be

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.750 
that I needed their strokes to be
shorter<00:00:22.500> instead<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:23.010> them<00:00:23.160> coming<00:00:23.310> down<00:00:23.490> and

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
shorter instead of them coming down and

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.130 
shorter instead of them coming down and
trying<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.150> be<00:00:24.240> quiet<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.600> trying<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.050> be

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
trying to be quiet and trying to be

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.570 
trying to be quiet and trying to be
quiet<00:00:25.439> I<00:00:25.560> just<00:00:25.859> wanted<00:00:26.039> their<00:00:26.160> strokes<00:00:26.460> to

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
quiet I just wanted their strokes to

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.920 
quiet I just wanted their strokes to
stay<00:00:26.730> under<00:00:26.939> like<00:00:27.090> three<00:00:27.330> inches<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:27.630> what<00:00:27.900> I

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
stay under like three inches so what I

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.320 
stay under like three inches so what I
would<00:00:28.019> do<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.470> put<00:00:28.650> my<00:00:28.830> hand<00:00:29.130> over<00:00:29.310> their<00:00:30.029> stick

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
would do is put my hand over their stick

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.910 
would do is put my hand over their stick
I<00:00:30.420> would<00:00:30.570> govern<00:00:30.810> how<00:00:31.170> high<00:00:31.349> they<00:00:31.529> could<00:00:31.590> play

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
I would govern how high they could play

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.200 
I would govern how high they could play
so<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.189> thought<00:00:32.430> man<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:32.730> wish<00:00:32.969> there<00:00:33.090> was

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
so I thought man I wish there was

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.819 
so I thought man I wish there was
something<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:33.600> would<00:00:33.930> do<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.320> for<00:00:34.380> them

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
something that would do that for them

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.410 
something that would do that for them
and<00:00:34.950> so<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.430> came<00:00:35.520> up<00:00:35.730> with<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.910> concept<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.360> the

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
and so I came up with the concept of the

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.090 
and so I came up with the concept of the
ghost<00:00:36.660> note<00:00:36.809> Pro<00:00:37.020> which<00:00:37.200> is<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.380> 13<00:00:37.860> inch

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
ghost note Pro which is a 13 inch

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.610 
ghost note Pro which is a 13 inch
practice<00:00:38.790> pad<00:00:39.000> so<00:00:39.989> it'll<00:00:40.140> mount<00:00:40.290> right<00:00:40.469> in

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
practice pad so it'll mount right in

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.290 
practice pad so it'll mount right in
your<00:00:40.710> snare<00:00:40.950> stand<00:00:41.190> but<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.640> also<00:00:41.790> has<00:00:42.090> a

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
your snare stand but it also has a

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.240 
your snare stand but it also has a
dynamic<00:00:43.020> control<00:00:43.410> bar<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.860> this<00:00:44.100> dynamic

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
dynamic control bar and this dynamic

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.180 
dynamic control bar and this dynamic
control<00:00:44.879> bar<00:00:45.090> will<00:00:45.539> keep<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.530> student's<00:00:47.010> hand

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
control bar will keep the student's hand

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.250 
control bar will keep the student's hand
in<00:00:47.430> your<00:00:47.610> hand<00:00:47.789> from<00:00:48.329> going<00:00:48.629> up<00:00:48.780> higher<00:00:49.020> than

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
in your hand from going up higher than

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.139 
in your hand from going up higher than
four<00:00:49.739> inches<00:00:50.010> or<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.399> can<00:00:50.550> lower<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.940> three

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
four inches or you can lower to three

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.400 
four inches or you can lower to three
inches<00:00:51.390> or<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.719> can<00:00:51.870> lower<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.199> the

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
inches or you can lower it to the

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.350 
inches or you can lower it to the
advanced<00:00:52.739> level<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.129> two<00:00:53.340> inches<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.820> that

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
advanced level of two inches and that

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.170 
advanced level of two inches and that
way<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:55.050> can<00:00:55.199> work<00:00:55.320> on<00:00:55.500> your<00:00:55.670> dynamics<00:00:56.670> your

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
way you can work on your dynamics your

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.400 
way you can work on your dynamics your
ghost<00:00:57.390> notes<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.780> can<00:00:57.840> work<00:00:58.050> on<00:00:58.170> single

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
ghost notes you can work on single

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.340 
ghost notes you can work on single
strokes<00:01:00.379> double<00:01:01.379> strokes<00:01:03.110> triple<00:01:04.110> strokes

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
strokes double strokes triple strokes

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.210 
strokes double strokes triple strokes
and<00:01:05.869> so<00:01:06.869> on<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.170> really<00:01:07.530> start<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.860> build<00:01:08.100> your

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
and so on and really start to build your

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.039 
and so on and really start to build your
dynamics<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:08.850> think<00:01:08.970> this<00:01:09.240> pad<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.750> the

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
dynamics so I think this pad and the

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.870 
dynamics so I think this pad and the
dynamic<00:01:10.439> control<00:01:10.740> bar<00:01:10.890> will<00:01:11.310> really<00:01:11.610> help<00:01:11.729> you

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
dynamic control bar will really help you

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.550 
dynamic control bar will really help you
out<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:12.030> lot<00:01:12.240> one<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.869> other<00:01:12.990> benefits<00:01:13.470> of

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
out a lot one of the other benefits of

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.469 
out a lot one of the other benefits of
the<00:01:13.650> ghost<00:01:13.860> note<00:01:14.040> practice<00:01:14.430> pad<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:14.850> the

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
the ghost note practice pad is the

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.149 
the ghost note practice pad is the
bottom<00:01:15.990> now<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.200> bottom<00:01:16.500> obviously<00:01:16.590> has<00:01:16.979> the

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
bottom now the bottom obviously has the

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.920 
bottom now the bottom obviously has the
neoprene<00:01:17.610> bottom<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.570> can<00:01:18.689> put<00:01:18.840> it

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
neoprene bottom so that you can put it

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.510 
neoprene bottom so that you can put it
on<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.049> hard<00:01:19.350> surface<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:20.040> your<00:01:20.130> parents<00:01:20.400> don't

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
on a hard surface and your parents don't

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.770 
on a hard surface and your parents don't
have<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.700> freak<00:01:20.939> out<00:01:21.030> when<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.299> practice<00:01:21.659> on

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
have to freak out when you practice on

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.570 
have to freak out when you practice on
the<00:01:21.900> coffee<00:01:22.110> table<00:01:22.560> but<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.040> also<00:01:23.159> has<00:01:23.430> the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
the coffee table but it also has the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.740 
the coffee table but it also has the
threaded<00:01:24.000> bottom<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.360> this<00:01:24.479> will<00:01:24.630> go

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
threaded bottom so this will go

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.840 
threaded bottom so this will go
perfectly<00:01:25.590> as<00:01:25.770> your<00:01:25.920> snare<00:01:26.189> replacement<00:01:26.759> for

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
perfectly as your snare replacement for

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.100 
perfectly as your snare replacement for
you're<00:01:26.939> going<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.240> wear<00:01:27.360> practice<00:01:27.689> pad<00:01:27.869> kit

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
my DW go anywhere practice kit this has

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.620 
my DW go anywhere practice kit this has
really<00:01:35.220> helped<00:01:35.460> out<00:01:35.549> my<00:01:35.579> drumset<00:01:36.090> dynamics<00:01:36.540> a

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
really helped out my drumset dynamics a

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.719 
really helped out my drumset dynamics a
lot<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:36.960> instead<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.409> just<00:01:37.560> playing<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:38.100> pattern

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
lot so instead of just playing a pattern

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.240 
lot so instead of just playing a pattern
on<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.360> pad<00:01:39.570> itself<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.380> know<00:01:40.500> maybe<00:01:40.710> kick

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
on the pad itself you know maybe kick

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.410 
on the pad itself you know maybe kick
right<00:01:41.460> left<00:01:41.670> kick<00:01:41.850> right<00:01:41.880> left<00:01:42.210> right<00:01:42.270> left

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
right left kick right left right left

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.420 
right left kick right left right left
now<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.049> can<00:01:43.290> start<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.590> move<00:01:43.740> my<00:01:43.920> right<00:01:44.189> hand

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
now I can start to move my right hand

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.069 
now I can start to move my right hand
around<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.820> kit<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.149> really<00:01:45.509> feel<00:01:45.689> like<00:01:45.750> what

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
around the kit and really feel like what

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.539 
around the kit and really feel like what
it<00:01:46.110> would<00:01:46.320> be<00:01:46.560> if<00:01:46.829> I<00:01:46.950> was<00:01:47.070> playing<00:01:47.310> on<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.460> drum

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
it would be if I was playing on a drum

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:57.230 
it would be if I was playing on a drum
set<00:01:54.979> all<00:01:55.979> while<00:01:56.399> keeping<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:56.790> left<00:01:57.030> hand

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
set all while keeping that left hand

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.090 
set all while keeping that left hand
down<00:01:57.329> keeping<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.020> dynamics<00:01:58.469> happening<00:01:58.799> now

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
down keeping the dynamics happening now

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.920 
down keeping the dynamics happening now
obviously<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.670> can<00:01:59.880> use<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.360> ghost<00:02:00.540> note<00:02:00.750> Pro

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
obviously you can use the ghost note Pro

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.690 
obviously you can use the ghost note Pro
practice<00:02:01.320> pad<00:02:01.500> on<00:02:01.740> your<00:02:01.799> DW<00:02:02.430> go<00:02:02.549> in<00:02:02.610> your

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
practice pad on your DW go in your

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.130 
practice pad on your DW go in your
practice<00:02:03.119> kit<00:02:03.299> but<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.509> can<00:02:03.630> also<00:02:03.780> just<00:02:04.049> use

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
practice kit but you can also just use

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.469 
practice kit but you can also just use
it<00:02:04.350> on<00:02:04.439> your<00:02:04.560> snare<00:02:04.890> drum<00:02:04.920> it's<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.729> 13<00:02:06.119> inch<00:02:06.270> pad

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
it on your snare drum it's a 13 inch pad

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.029 
it on your snare drum it's a 13 inch pad
so<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.659> will<00:02:06.780> fit<00:02:06.960> perfect<00:02:07.409> on<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.560> 14<00:02:07.920> inch

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
so it will fit perfect on a 14 inch

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.710 
so it will fit perfect on a 14 inch
snare<00:02:08.220> drum<00:02:08.369> or<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.610> 13<00:02:09.030> inch<00:02:09.179> snare<00:02:09.390> drum<00:02:09.569> and

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
snare drum or a 13 inch snare drum and

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.780 
snare drum or a 13 inch snare drum and
that<00:02:09.780> way<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:11.129> get<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.340> little<00:02:11.550> bit<00:02:11.610> of<00:02:11.700> that

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
that way you get a little bit of that

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.630 
that way you get a little bit of that
snare<00:02:12.150> response<00:02:12.660> when<00:02:12.870> you<00:02:12.900> practice<00:02:13.410> you

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
snare response when you practice you

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.340 
snare response when you practice you
and<00:02:13.730> really<00:02:14.150> here<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:14.390> volume<00:02:14.870> of<00:02:14.990> your<00:02:15.020> ghost

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
and really here the volume of your ghost

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.750 
and really here the volume of your ghost
notes<00:02:15.560> a<00:02:15.740> lot<00:02:15.980> of<00:02:16.040> times<00:02:16.190> I'll<00:02:16.310> just<00:02:16.340> work<00:02:16.580> on

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
notes a lot of times I'll just work on

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.130 
notes a lot of times I'll just work on
my<00:02:16.790> inverted<00:02:17.690> double<00:02:17.990> strokes<00:02:18.260> like<00:02:18.380> that<00:02:20.140> so

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
my inverted double strokes like that so

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.370 
my inverted double strokes like that so
I<00:02:21.170> can<00:02:21.410> hear<00:02:21.740> both<00:02:22.010> strokes<00:02:25.569> the<00:02:26.569> goal<00:02:26.810> is<00:02:27.110> not

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
I can hear both strokes the goal is not

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.010 
I can hear both strokes the goal is not
to<00:02:27.440> hit<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.160> dynamic<00:02:28.730> control<00:02:29.090> bar<00:02:29.300> as<00:02:29.510> you

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
to hit the dynamic control bar as you

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.440 
to hit the dynamic control bar as you
speed<00:02:30.290> up<00:02:30.320> that<00:02:31.280> gets<00:02:31.520> harder<00:02:31.940> and<00:02:32.030> harder<00:02:32.090> to

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
speed up that gets harder and harder to

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:40.449 
speed up that gets harder and harder to
do<00:02:38.290> it<00:02:39.290> does<00:02:39.470> make<00:02:39.680> practicing<00:02:40.130> a<00:02:40.190> little<00:02:40.370> bit

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
do it does make practicing a little bit

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:41.530 
do it does make practicing a little bit
more<00:02:40.580> challenging<00:02:41.000> and<00:02:41.090> definitely<00:02:41.420> a<00:02:41.450> little

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
more challenging and definitely a little

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.640 
more challenging and definitely a little
more<00:02:41.630> fun<00:02:41.930> one<00:02:42.230> of<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.350> other<00:02:42.470> great<00:02:42.590> features

about<00:02:43.100> the<00:02:43.190> ghost<00:02:43.400> note<00:02:43.610> Pro<00:02:43.819> practice<00:02:44.209> pad<00:02:44.390> is

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
about the ghost note Pro practice pad is

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.479 
about the ghost note Pro practice pad is
that<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:45.110> dynamic<00:02:45.590> control<00:02:45.920> bar<00:02:46.100> can<00:02:46.310> raise

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
that the dynamic control bar can raise

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:47.920 
that the dynamic control bar can raise
up<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:46.910> down<00:02:47.030> so<00:02:47.209> in<00:02:47.300> the<00:02:47.390> beginning<00:02:47.690> when

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
up and down so in the beginning when

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.000 
up and down so in the beginning when
you're<00:02:48.020> just<00:02:48.290> starting<00:02:48.410> to<00:02:48.560> work<00:02:48.650> out<00:02:48.800> at<00:02:48.920> your

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
you're just starting to work out at your

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.070 
you're just starting to work out at your
dynamics<00:02:49.520> you<00:02:49.970> can<00:02:50.000> have<00:02:50.270> it<00:02:50.420> up<00:02:50.540> as<00:02:50.750> tall<00:02:51.020> as

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
dynamics you can have it up as tall as

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.900 
dynamics you can have it up as tall as
it'll<00:02:51.410> go<00:02:51.440> now<00:02:51.920> it<00:02:52.100> comes<00:02:52.400> in<00:02:52.550> one<00:02:52.700> inch

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
it'll go now it comes in one inch

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.070 
it'll go now it comes in one inch
increments<00:02:53.239> so<00:02:53.510> there's<00:02:53.660> a<00:02:53.720> little<00:02:53.900> lines

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
increments so there's a little lines

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.840 
increments so there's a little lines
here<00:02:54.290> that<00:02:54.320> will<00:02:54.590> help<00:02:54.739> you<00:02:54.920> understand<00:02:55.340> where

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
here that will help you understand where

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.430 
here that will help you understand where
to<00:02:55.880> set<00:02:56.150> it<00:02:56.269> so<00:02:56.420> maybe<00:02:56.630> for<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:56.930> first<00:02:56.959> week<00:02:57.320> or

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
to set it so maybe for the first week or

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.080 
to set it so maybe for the first week or
so<00:02:57.620> you<00:02:57.680> have<00:02:57.890> it<00:02:58.010> at<00:02:58.190> the<00:02:58.459> four<00:02:58.700> inch<00:02:58.850> mark

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
so you have it at the four inch mark

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.820 
so you have it at the four inch mark
then<00:02:59.600> you<00:02:59.750> can<00:02:59.900> move<00:03:00.019> it<00:03:00.170> down<00:03:00.350> a<00:03:00.560> little<00:03:00.680> bit

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
then you can move it down a little bit

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.350 
then you can move it down a little bit
more<00:03:01.100> and<00:03:01.310> a<00:03:01.340> little<00:03:01.370> bit<00:03:01.580> more<00:03:01.880> now<00:03:02.030> for<00:03:02.239> me

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
more and a little bit more now for me

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.729 
more and a little bit more now for me
personally<00:03:02.600> I<00:03:02.870> usually<00:03:03.110> leave<00:03:03.440> it<00:03:03.560> at<00:03:03.650> the

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
personally I usually leave it at the

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.350 
personally I usually leave it at the
three<00:03:04.010> inch<00:03:04.160> mark<00:03:04.250> because<00:03:04.910> that's<00:03:05.120> about

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
three inch mark because that's about

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.000 
three inch mark because that's about
where<00:03:05.540> I<00:03:05.570> feel<00:03:05.780> ghost<00:03:06.080> notes<00:03:06.290> sound<00:03:06.680> great<00:03:06.860> on

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
where I feel ghost notes sound great on

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.890 
where I feel ghost notes sound great on
a<00:03:07.040> snare<00:03:07.310> drum<00:03:07.370> but<00:03:08.030> sometimes<00:03:08.570> I<00:03:08.660> might<00:03:08.750> be

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
a snare drum but sometimes I might be

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.040 
a snare drum but sometimes I might be
playing<00:03:09.200> and<00:03:09.410> say<00:03:10.000> you<00:03:11.000> know<00:03:11.120> a<00:03:11.300> dinner<00:03:11.750> club

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
playing and say you know a dinner club

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.210 
playing and say you know a dinner club
or<00:03:12.260> something<00:03:12.470> would<00:03:12.620> have<00:03:12.709> to<00:03:12.800> play<00:03:12.950> really

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
or something would have to play really

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.009 
or something would have to play really
quiet<00:03:13.459> then<00:03:13.820> I'd<00:03:13.940> work<00:03:14.180> on<00:03:14.330> it<00:03:14.480> at<00:03:14.630> the<00:03:14.810> two

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
quiet then I'd work on it at the two

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.199 
quiet then I'd work on it at the two
inch<00:03:15.230> increment<00:03:15.739> so<00:03:16.580> the<00:03:16.670> more<00:03:16.850> and<00:03:17.000> more<00:03:17.090> you

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
inch increment so the more and more you

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:18.490 
inch increment so the more and more you
get<00:03:17.300> used<00:03:17.360> to<00:03:17.600> that<00:03:17.780> the<00:03:18.110> better<00:03:18.260> it's<00:03:18.410> going

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
get used to that the better it's going

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.110 
get used to that the better it's going
to<00:03:18.560> be<00:03:18.650> another<00:03:19.160> thing<00:03:19.400> that<00:03:19.549> you<00:03:19.640> can<00:03:19.790> do<00:03:19.940> is

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
to be another thing that you can do is

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.479 
to be another thing that you can do is
you<00:03:20.600> can<00:03:20.750> take<00:03:20.989> the<00:03:21.410> dynamic<00:03:21.860> control<00:03:22.160> bar<00:03:22.310> off

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
you can take the dynamic control bar off

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.490 
you can take the dynamic control bar off
of<00:03:22.790> this<00:03:22.910> side<00:03:23.180> and<00:03:23.420> put<00:03:23.840> it<00:03:23.930> on<00:03:24.049> to<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:24.320> other

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
of this side and put it on to the other

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.949 
of this side and put it on to the other
side<00:03:24.860> so<00:03:25.250> for<00:03:25.459> left-handed<00:03:26.060> drummers<00:03:26.450> or<00:03:26.630> for

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
side so for left-handed drummers or for

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:27.910 
side so for left-handed drummers or for
people<00:03:27.170> that<00:03:27.290> want<00:03:27.470> to<00:03:27.530> work<00:03:27.620> on<00:03:27.799> their

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
people that want to work on their

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.259 
people that want to work on their
dynamics<00:03:28.310> on<00:03:28.430> their<00:03:28.610> right<00:03:28.820> hand<00:03:29.030> on<00:03:29.150> their

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
dynamics on their right hand on their

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:30.940 
dynamics on their right hand on their
lead<00:03:29.420> hand<00:03:29.630> you<00:03:30.019> can<00:03:30.170> just<00:03:30.320> move<00:03:30.470> it<00:03:30.590> over<00:03:30.680> to

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
lead hand you can just move it over to

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.130 
lead hand you can just move it over to
this<00:03:31.100> side<00:03:31.160> so<00:03:31.519> it<00:03:31.610> unscrews<00:03:32.000> from<00:03:32.239> here<00:03:32.510> and

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
this side so it unscrews from here and

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.539 
this side so it unscrews from here and
then<00:03:33.350> screws<00:03:33.590> right<00:03:33.769> in<00:03:33.890> to<00:03:34.010> this<00:03:34.130> side<00:03:34.400> and

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
then screws right in to this side and

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.190 
then screws right in to this side and
then<00:03:34.610> you<00:03:34.910> can<00:03:35.030> work<00:03:35.209> on<00:03:35.390> both<00:03:35.630> hands<00:03:35.959> and<00:03:36.140> I

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
then you can work on both hands and I

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.630 
then you can work on both hands and I
would<00:03:36.320> definitely<00:03:36.530> recommend<00:03:37.190> doing<00:03:37.340> that

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
would definitely recommend doing that

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.670 
would definitely recommend doing that
maybe<00:03:38.090> you<00:03:38.209> work<00:03:38.390> for<00:03:38.630> a<00:03:38.660> few<00:03:38.930> minutes<00:03:39.230> with

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
maybe you work for a few minutes with

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.229 
maybe you work for a few minutes with
your<00:03:39.860> left<00:03:40.190> hand<00:03:40.340> under<00:03:40.549> this<00:03:40.700> doing<00:03:40.970> double

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
your left hand under this doing double

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:42.580 
your left hand under this doing double
strokes<00:03:41.510> and<00:03:41.630> then<00:03:41.930> switch<00:03:42.140> it<00:03:42.170> over<00:03:42.320> to<00:03:42.470> the

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
strokes and then switch it over to the

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:43.900 
strokes and then switch it over to the
other<00:03:42.650> side<00:03:42.890> and<00:03:43.040> that'll<00:03:43.250> really<00:03:43.519> improve

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
other side and that'll really improve

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.789 
other side and that'll really improve
your<00:03:43.940> dynamics<00:03:44.510> on<00:03:44.630> both<00:03:44.810> hands<00:03:45.049> now<00:03:45.560> as<00:03:45.650> far

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
your dynamics on both hands now as far

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:47.259 
your dynamics on both hands now as far
as<00:03:45.860> the<00:03:46.040> playing<00:03:46.310> surface<00:03:46.489> itself<00:03:47.030> it's

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
as the playing surface itself it's

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.870 
as the playing surface itself it's
something<00:03:47.630> that<00:03:47.810> I<00:03:47.989> feel<00:03:48.769> is<00:03:48.980> that<00:03:49.010> perfect

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
something that I feel is that perfect

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.420 
something that I feel is that perfect
balance<00:03:50.120> between<00:03:50.450> you<00:03:51.440> know<00:03:51.560> not<00:03:52.010> being<00:03:52.250> too

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
balance between you know not being too

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.920 
balance between you know not being too
soft<00:03:52.670> and<00:03:52.850> not<00:03:53.000> being<00:03:53.180> too<00:03:53.360> hard<00:03:53.570> I<00:03:53.660> want<00:03:53.810> a

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
soft and not being too hard I want a

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.690 
soft and not being too hard I want a
realistic<00:03:54.500> feel<00:03:54.530> I<00:03:54.709> want<00:03:55.190> to<00:03:55.340> make<00:03:55.459> sure<00:03:55.489> that

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
realistic feel I want to make sure that

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.370 
realistic feel I want to make sure that
my<00:03:55.820> left<00:03:56.060> hand<00:03:56.299> is<00:03:56.390> getting<00:03:56.540> that<00:03:56.780> same<00:03:57.140> type

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
my left hand is getting that same type

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.380 
my left hand is getting that same type
of<00:03:57.410> rebound<00:03:57.860> it<00:03:58.070> would<00:03:58.250> get<00:03:58.489> on<00:03:58.730> my<00:03:59.120> snare<00:03:59.360> drum

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
of rebound it would get on my snare drum

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.420 
of rebound it would get on my snare drum
when<00:03:59.690> I'm<00:03:59.810> playing<00:04:00.049> ghost<00:04:00.410> notes<00:04:00.650> some<00:04:01.220> pads

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
when I'm playing ghost notes some pads

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.130 
when I'm playing ghost notes some pads
can<00:04:01.700> be<00:04:01.820> a<00:04:01.850> little<00:04:02.030> too<00:04:02.239> mushy<00:04:02.510> and<00:04:02.810> some<00:04:02.989> can

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
can be a little too mushy and some can

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.289 
can be a little too mushy and some can
definitely<00:04:03.470> be<00:04:03.560> too<00:04:03.890> stiff<00:04:04.370> and<00:04:04.610> you're<00:04:05.180> not

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
definitely be too stiff and you're not

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:07.060 
definitely be too stiff and you're not
getting<00:04:05.510> a<00:04:05.540> very<00:04:05.570> realistic<00:04:05.989> feel<00:04:06.380> but<00:04:06.860> this

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
getting a very realistic feel but this

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.130 
getting a very realistic feel but this
pad<00:04:07.340> material<00:04:07.549> itself<00:04:08.150> and<00:04:08.360> the<00:04:08.420> thickness<00:04:08.959> of

pad material itself and the thickness of
the<00:04:09.440> of<00:04:09.650> the<00:04:09.799> rubber<00:04:10.040> really<00:04:10.850> gives<00:04:11.030> you<00:04:11.120> a

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
the of the rubber really gives you a

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.360 
the of the rubber really gives you a
very<00:04:11.390> realistic<00:04:11.840> feel<00:04:12.260> to<00:04:12.590> really<00:04:13.010> improve

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
very realistic feel to really improve
