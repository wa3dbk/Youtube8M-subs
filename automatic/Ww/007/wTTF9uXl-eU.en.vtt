00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.130 

I<00:03:20.250> can<00:03:20.820> make<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.120> colors<00:03:21.450> move<00:03:21.720> just<00:03:21.960> a<00:03:22.110> little

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
I can make the colors move just a little

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.010 
I can make the colors move just a little
bit<00:03:22.430> by<00:03:23.430> tilting<00:03:23.760> the<00:03:24.060> paper<00:03:24.300> and<00:03:24.840> this

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
bit by tilting the paper and this

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.000 
bit by tilting the paper and this
creates<00:03:25.410> some<00:03:25.560> nice<00:03:25.920> soft<00:03:26.310> blends<00:03:27.590> as<00:03:28.590> long<00:03:28.830> as

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
creates some nice soft blends as long as

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.300 
creates some nice soft blends as long as
there's<00:03:29.190> still<00:03:29.510> a<00:03:30.510> nice<00:03:30.930> even<00:03:31.440> shine<00:03:31.770> on<00:03:32.160> the

there's still a nice even shine on the
surface<00:03:32.760> I<00:03:32.940> can<00:03:32.970> go<00:03:33.330> back<00:03:33.570> in<00:03:33.870> and<00:03:34.130> add<00:03:35.130> color

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
surface I can go back in and add color

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.650

here<00:03:36.060> and<00:03:36.180> there<00:03:38.000> as<00:03:39.000> soon<00:03:39.150> as<00:03:39.210> the<00:03:39.390> shine

here and there as soon as the shine
begins<00:03:40.050> to<00:03:40.230> go<00:03:40.380> off<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.770> paper<00:03:41.010> though<00:03:41.280> you

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
begins to go off the paper though you

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:47.480 
begins to go off the paper though you
can't<00:03:41.820> add<00:03:42.030> color<00:03:42.330> any<00:03:42.570> longer<00:03:46.160> as<00:03:47.160> you<00:03:47.250> can

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
can't add color any longer as you can
