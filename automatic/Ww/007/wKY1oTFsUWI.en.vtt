this<00:00:04.359> year<00:00:04.600> we<00:00:04.720> had<00:00:04.870> eight<00:00:05.140> students<00:00:05.710> and<00:00:06.930> we

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:07.930 
this year we had eight students and we

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.720 
this year we had eight students and we
came<00:00:08.170> up<00:00:08.320> with<00:00:08.469> this<00:00:08.590> design<00:00:08.799> after<00:00:09.430> many

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:09.730 
came up with this design after many

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.449 
came up with this design after many
iterations<00:00:09.969> and<00:00:10.600> many<00:00:10.780> different<00:00:11.459> evolutions

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:12.459 
iterations and many different evolutions

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:15.299 
iterations and many different evolutions
of<00:00:12.639> it<00:00:12.820> to<00:00:13.510> serve<00:00:14.049> the<00:00:14.260> purpose<00:00:14.559> of<00:00:14.740> creating<00:00:15.070> a

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:15.309 
of it to serve the purpose of creating a

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:17.070 
of it to serve the purpose of creating a
sense<00:00:15.490> of<00:00:15.730> space<00:00:16.059> and<00:00:16.090> introduction<00:00:16.930> and

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.080 
sense of space and introduction and

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.310 
sense of space and introduction and
welcome<00:00:17.230> to<00:00:17.770> yes<00:00:17.980> tomorrow<00:00:18.250> we<00:00:19.119> built<00:00:19.449> about

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.320 
welcome to yes tomorrow we built about

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.769 
welcome to yes tomorrow we built about
10<00:00:20.769> different<00:00:20.980> arches<00:00:21.580> everybody<00:00:22.419> built<00:00:22.660> an

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:22.779 
10 different arches everybody built an

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:24.570 
10 different arches everybody built an
arch<00:00:22.960> and<00:00:23.169> we<00:00:23.289> built<00:00:23.499> two<00:00:23.740> that<00:00:23.980> stood<00:00:24.279> all

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
arch and we built two that stood all

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.480 
arch and we built two that stood all
week<00:00:24.910> so<00:00:25.480> of<00:00:25.810> the<00:00:26.259> eight<00:00:26.499> students<00:00:27.130> everyone

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
week so of the eight students everyone

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.880 
week so of the eight students everyone
built<00:00:27.699> an<00:00:27.820> arch<00:00:27.999> we<00:00:28.599> worked<00:00:28.810> on<00:00:28.990> balance<00:00:29.560> of

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
built an arch we worked on balance of

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.569 
built an arch we worked on balance of
stone<00:00:30.669> stacking<00:00:31.359> and<00:00:31.570> creating<00:00:32.050> multiple

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
stone stacking and creating multiple

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.640 
stone stacking and creating multiple
stone<00:00:33.579> pieces<00:00:34.060> that<00:00:34.300> would<00:00:34.510> balance<00:00:34.780> in<00:00:35.170> a

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:35.650 
stone pieces that would balance in a

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.770 
stone pieces that would balance in a
group<00:00:35.890> we<00:00:36.640> looked<00:00:36.880> at<00:00:37.030> retaining<00:00:37.420> walls

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
group we looked at retaining walls

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.580 
group we looked at retaining walls
double<00:00:38.680> faced<00:00:38.860> walls<00:00:39.220> square<00:00:40.150> corners<00:00:40.690> and<00:00:41.440> we

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
double faced walls square corners and we

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.100 
double faced walls square corners and we
talked<00:00:41.830> about<00:00:41.950> the<00:00:42.730> Fibonacci<00:00:42.940> math<00:00:43.570> that

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
talked about the Fibonacci math that

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.260 
talked about the Fibonacci math that
goes<00:00:44.260> into<00:00:44.470> creating<00:00:44.620> a<00:00:45.190> shape<00:00:45.670> in<00:00:45.880> a<00:00:45.970> form

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
goes into creating a shape in a form

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.110 
goes into creating a shape in a form
like<00:00:46.330> this<00:00:46.690> the<00:00:47.500> law<00:00:47.680> of<00:00:47.830> the<00:00:47.920> circle<00:00:48.400> the<00:00:48.940> law

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
like this the law of the circle the law

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.200 
like this the law of the circle the law
of<00:00:49.300> water<00:00:49.920> we<00:00:50.920> talked<00:00:51.160> about<00:00:51.280> temperature<00:00:51.970> and

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
of water we talked about temperature and

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.660 
of water we talked about temperature and
of<00:00:52.510> gravity<00:00:53.050> and<00:00:53.380> so<00:00:53.740> all<00:00:54.190> of<00:00:54.250> those<00:00:54.610> things

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
of gravity and so all of those things

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.810 
of gravity and so all of those things
came<00:00:55.180> together<00:00:55.330> to<00:00:55.840> create<00:00:55.870> a<00:00:56.260> shape<00:00:56.710> that<00:00:57.040> we

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
came together to create a shape that we

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.600 
came together to create a shape that we
then<00:00:58.060> nestled<00:00:58.990> into<00:00:59.290> the<00:00:59.530> landscape<00:01:00.130> so<00:01:00.460> the

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
then nestled into the landscape so the

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.090 
then nestled into the landscape so the
landscape<00:01:01.060> itself<00:01:01.450> and<00:01:01.870> all<00:01:02.470> the<00:01:02.650> math<00:01:02.860> of

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
landscape itself and all the math of

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.950 
landscape itself and all the math of
what<00:01:03.280> we<00:01:03.400> learned<00:01:03.730> how<00:01:04.000> to<00:01:04.030> do<00:01:04.299> all<00:01:04.629> fit

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
what we learned how to do all fit

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:05.429 
what we learned how to do all fit
together

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:05.439 
together

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:08.039 
together
to<00:01:06.009> create<00:01:06.250> this<00:01:06.909> shape<00:01:07.270> that's<00:01:07.570> sitting<00:01:07.899> in

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
to create this shape that's sitting in

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:10.109 
to create this shape that's sitting in
this<00:01:08.200> space<00:01:08.499> we've<00:01:09.310> had<00:01:09.490> slideshows<00:01:10.090> and

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
this space we've had slideshows and

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:12.389 
this space we've had slideshows and
different<00:01:10.869> events<00:01:10.990> every<00:01:11.499> night<00:01:11.710> we<00:01:12.219> had<00:01:12.369> a

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:12.399 
different events every night we had a

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:15.389 
different events every night we had a
bonfire<00:01:12.820> and<00:01:13.600> a<00:01:13.659> cook<00:01:14.350> out<00:01:14.499> last<00:01:14.770> night<00:01:14.950> and

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
bonfire and a cook out last night and

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:17.929 
bonfire and a cook out last night and
different<00:01:16.119> things<00:01:16.329> that<00:01:16.420> were<00:01:16.600> both<00:01:16.810> art<00:01:17.439> and

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
different things that were both art and

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.309 
different things that were both art and
playful<00:01:18.939> we<00:01:19.179> played<00:01:19.359> in<00:01:19.479> the<00:01:19.509> river<00:01:19.749> yesterday

00:01:20.309 --> 00:01:20.319 
playful we played in the river yesterday

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:21.809 
playful we played in the river yesterday
it<00:01:20.409> was<00:01:20.499> really<00:01:20.710> hot<00:01:20.920> it<00:01:21.189> was<00:01:21.280> nice<00:01:21.490> to<00:01:21.670> get<00:01:21.759> a

00:01:21.809 --> 00:01:21.819 
it was really hot it was nice to get a

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:24.660 
it was really hot it was nice to get a
break<00:01:21.969> from<00:01:22.299> baking<00:01:23.200> in<00:01:23.289> the<00:01:23.319> Sun<00:01:23.439> and<00:01:23.920> made

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
break from baking in the Sun and made

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.760 
break from baking in the Sun and made
arches<00:01:25.060> and<00:01:25.179> bouncy<00:01:25.569> things<00:01:25.810> without<00:01:26.740> a

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
arches and bouncy things without a

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.190 
arches and bouncy things without a
wooden<00:01:27.130> form<00:01:27.399> a<00:01:27.640> frame<00:01:27.969> so<00:01:28.539> everyone<00:01:29.020> could

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
wooden form a frame so everyone could

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.349 
wooden form a frame so everyone could
learn<00:01:29.229> how<00:01:29.590> they<00:01:30.280> could<00:01:30.490> take<00:01:30.640> this<00:01:30.850> art<00:01:31.090> form

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:31.359 
learn how they could take this art form

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:33.569 
learn how they could take this art form
home<00:01:31.569> and<00:01:31.869> do<00:01:32.259> it<00:01:32.380> on<00:01:32.499> their<00:01:32.619> own<00:01:32.679> or<00:01:32.829> wherever

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579 
home and do it on their own or wherever

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:35.940 
home and do it on their own or wherever
they<00:01:33.759> were<00:01:33.819> and<00:01:34.689> you're<00:01:34.840> lifting<00:01:35.020> stones<00:01:35.619> that

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
they were and you're lifting stones that

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.249 
they were and you're lifting stones that
maybe<00:01:36.159> are<00:01:36.369> a<00:01:36.399> hundred<00:01:36.609> pounds<00:01:37.240> everyone<00:01:38.049> has

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
maybe are a hundred pounds everyone has

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.879 
maybe are a hundred pounds everyone has
to<00:01:38.530> move<00:01:38.770> and<00:01:38.979> act<00:01:39.219> as<00:01:39.460> one<00:01:39.700> person<00:01:40.659> so<00:01:41.170> there

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:41.889 
to move and act as one person so there

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:44.069 
to move and act as one person so there
are<00:01:41.979> lots<00:01:42.159> of<00:01:42.539> team-building<00:01:43.539> exercises

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:44.079 
are lots of team-building exercises

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:46.139 
are lots of team-building exercises
where<00:01:44.439> we<00:01:44.469> broke<00:01:44.799> up<00:01:45.100> into<00:01:45.429> groups<00:01:45.670> of<00:01:45.939> two<00:01:46.119> and

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
where we broke up into groups of two and

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:50.039 
where we broke up into groups of two and
groups<00:01:46.479> of<00:01:46.630> four<00:01:46.929> and<00:01:47.229> then<00:01:47.799> in<00:01:48.069> the<00:01:48.490> end<00:01:49.049> we

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
groups of four and then in the end we

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:51.749 
groups of four and then in the end we
were<00:01:50.170> one<00:01:50.469> group<00:01:50.709> of<00:01:50.859> eight<00:01:51.100> thinking<00:01:51.609> and

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
were one group of eight thinking and

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.819 
were one group of eight thinking and
moving<00:01:51.909> and<00:01:52.179> being<00:01:52.420> as<00:01:52.689> one<00:01:52.959> person<00:01:53.439> so

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:53.829 
moving and being as one person so

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:56.330 
moving and being as one person so
there's<00:01:53.979> a<00:01:54.069> lot<00:01:54.249> of<00:01:54.399> movement<00:01:54.729> among<00:01:55.359> us<00:01:55.539> of

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
there's a lot of movement among us of

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.260 
there's a lot of movement among us of
conversation<00:01:57.340> and<00:01:57.459> dialogue<00:01:58.170> driven<00:01:59.170> stone

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
conversation and dialogue driven stone

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.879 
conversation and dialogue driven stone
manipulation<00:02:01.270> it<00:02:01.869> was<00:02:02.049> really<00:02:02.289> cool<00:02:02.469> to<00:02:02.679> see
