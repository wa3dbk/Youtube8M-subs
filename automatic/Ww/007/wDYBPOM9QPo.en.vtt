00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
with a track pad on it so i'm gonna be

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.859 
with a track pad on it so i'm gonna be
really<00:00:23.130> really<00:00:23.310> bad<00:00:23.670> at<00:00:23.820> this<00:00:23.939> so<00:00:24.210> please

really really bad at this so please
don't<00:00:25.199> judge<00:00:25.410> me<00:00:26.420> so<00:00:27.420> yeah<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:28.500> just<00:00:28.800> compile

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
don't judge me so yeah I just compile

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.740 
don't judge me so yeah I just compile
this<00:00:29.490> last<00:00:29.699> night<00:00:29.880> took<00:00:30.029> about<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.480> little<00:00:30.660> over

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
this last night took about a little over

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.799 
this last night took about a little over
an<00:00:30.900> hour<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.560> compile<00:00:31.949> from<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.279> Raspberry<00:00:32.579> Pi

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
an hour to compile from the Raspberry Pi

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:38.540 
an hour to compile from the Raspberry Pi
to<00:00:33.809> compile<00:00:34.440> quake<00:00:34.710> 3<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:37.190> let's<00:00:38.190> go<00:00:38.430> ahead

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
to compile quake 3 and let's go ahead

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:52.760 
to compile quake 3 and let's go ahead
and<00:00:39.829> just<00:00:40.829> going<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.070> launch<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.520> up<00:00:45.530> all<00:00:46.530> right

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.110 

so<00:00:53.770> we<00:00:53.829> got<00:00:53.980> sam<00:00:54.280> took<00:00:54.519> me<00:00:54.640> a<00:00:54.670> while<00:00:54.820> to<00:00:54.910> get<00:00:55.000> the

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
so we got sam took me a while to get the

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:03.090 
so we got sam took me a while to get the
sound<00:00:55.300> going<00:00:57.210> ra<00:00:59.040> looks<00:01:00.040> familiar<00:01:00.219> e<00:01:02.010> let<00:01:03.010> me

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
sound going ra looks familiar e let me

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.910 
sound going ra looks familiar e let me
make<00:01:03.280> sure<00:01:03.930> ok<00:01:04.930> yeah<00:01:05.140> so<00:01:05.290> you<00:01:05.409> can<00:01:05.560> see<00:01:05.800> it's

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
make sure ok yeah so you can see it's

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.510 
make sure ok yeah so you can see it's
actually<00:01:06.190> running<00:01:07.649> 1280<00:01:08.649> x<00:01:08.860> 1024<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:10.200> i<00:01:11.200> just

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
actually running 1280 x 1024 and i just

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.520 
actually running 1280 x 1024 and i just
the<00:01:12.520> textures<00:01:13.000> up<00:01:13.210> high<00:01:13.420> tech<00:01:14.229> street<00:01:14.409> does

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
the textures up high tech street does

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:28.890 
the textures up high tech street does
that<00:01:14.560> pie

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.780 

yeah<00:01:29.620> I<00:01:29.650> played<00:01:29.980> this<00:01:30.070> game<00:01:30.250> it<00:01:30.370> forever<00:01:30.580> it

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
yeah I played this game it forever it

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.180 
yeah I played this game it forever it
kind<00:01:30.940> of<00:01:30.970> brings<00:01:31.090> me<00:01:31.240> back<00:01:31.920> but<00:01:32.920> this<00:01:33.010> is<00:01:33.160> just

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
kind of brings me back but this is just

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.030 
kind of brings me back but this is just
a<00:01:33.370> good<00:01:33.520> it<00:01:33.820> just<00:01:34.000> shows<00:01:34.150> you<00:01:34.270> like<00:01:34.630> really<00:01:35.140> how

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
a good it just shows you like really how

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.830 
a good it just shows you like really how
how<00:01:36.520> will<00:01:36.700> the<00:01:36.820> Raspberry<00:01:37.180> Pi<00:01:37.210> does<00:01:37.510> with

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
how will the Raspberry Pi does with

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.890 
how will the Raspberry Pi does with
graphics<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:39.490> GPU<00:01:39.910> is<00:01:39.940> pretty<00:01:40.240> solid<00:01:40.450> on<00:01:40.750> it

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
graphics the GPU is pretty solid on it

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:52.530 
graphics the GPU is pretty solid on it
and<00:01:43.500> major<00:01:48.330> but<00:01:49.330> I<00:01:51.240> don't<00:01:52.240> have<00:01:52.300> an<00:01:52.420> actual

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
and major but I don't have an actual

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.420 
and major but I don't have an actual
frame<00:01:52.900> way<00:01:53.050> right<00:01:53.230> now<00:01:53.260> but<00:01:53.590> as<00:01:53.770> you<00:01:54.040> can<00:01:54.190> see

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
frame way right now but as you can see

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:46.060 
frame way right now but as you can see
it's<00:01:54.610> pretty<00:01:54.940> dang<00:01:55.150> smooth

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:59.800 

we<00:02:47.070> try<00:02:47.220> different<00:02:47.580> level

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.870 

yeah<00:03:00.709> but<00:03:00.920> it<00:03:01.250> actually<00:03:01.370> does<00:03:01.580> really<00:03:01.730> well

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
yeah but it actually does really well

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.790 
yeah but it actually does really well
it's<00:03:02.239> really<00:03:02.690> smooth<00:03:02.959> and<00:03:05.500> I'm<00:03:06.500> kind<00:03:06.770> of

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
it's really smooth and I'm kind of

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.930 
it's really smooth and I'm kind of
looking<00:03:06.920> forward<00:03:07.250> to<00:03:07.370> finding<00:03:07.610> out<00:03:07.730> where<00:03:07.880> the

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
looking forward to finding out where the

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.270 
looking forward to finding out where the
games<00:03:08.120> can<00:03:08.360> run<00:03:08.540> off<00:03:08.660> this<00:03:08.870> and<00:03:09.290> kind<00:03:10.040> of<00:03:10.130> mess

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
games can run off this and kind of mess

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.190 
games can run off this and kind of mess
around<00:03:10.400> with<00:03:10.640> it<00:03:10.819> but<00:03:11.000> I<00:03:11.690> haven't<00:03:12.110> actually

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
around with it but I haven't actually

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:38.440 
around with it but I haven't actually
played<00:03:12.380> cigarette<00:03:13.130> yeah<00:03:36.640> hi<00:03:37.640> I'm<00:03:37.910> just<00:03:38.180> really

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
played cigarette yeah hi I'm just really

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:56.500 
played cigarette yeah hi I'm just really
screwed<00:03:38.720> up<00:03:54.519> yeah<00:03:55.519> this<00:03:55.730> level<00:03:56.030> going<00:03:56.209> on<00:03:56.299> top

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
screwed up yeah this level going on top

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:08.560 
screwed up yeah this level going on top
here<00:04:04.750> anyway<00:04:05.750> that's<00:04:05.989> my<00:04:06.049> demo<00:04:07.420> there's<00:04:08.420> some

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
here anyway that's my demo there's some

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.090 
here anyway that's my demo there's some
like<00:04:08.690> artifacts<00:04:09.170> on<00:04:09.440> the<00:04:09.530> screen<00:04:09.769> and<00:04:09.950> you<00:04:10.010> can

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
like artifacts on the screen and you can

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.759 
like artifacts on the screen and you can
see<00:04:10.250> right<00:04:10.280> there<00:04:10.579> kind<00:04:10.910> of<00:04:10.940> flashing<00:04:11.299> up<00:04:11.420> I

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
see right there kind of flashing up I

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.440 
see right there kind of flashing up I
just<00:04:12.769> know<00:04:12.890> this<00:04:13.010> in<00:04:13.160> that<00:04:13.310> there's<00:04:14.209> a<00:04:14.299> little

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
just know this in that there's a little

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:15.759 
just know this in that there's a little
bit<00:04:14.600> of<00:04:14.660> kind<00:04:14.840> of<00:04:14.900> weird<00:04:15.049> stuff<00:04:15.140> going<00:04:15.290> on<00:04:15.560> but

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
bit of kind of weird stuff going on but

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.440 
bit of kind of weird stuff going on but
other<00:04:15.950> than<00:04:16.039> that<00:04:16.329> it<00:04:17.329> runs<00:04:17.510> pretty<00:04:17.810> well<00:04:18.019> and

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
other than that it runs pretty well and

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.650 
other than that it runs pretty well and
it's<00:04:20.450> fun<00:04:20.720> it's<00:04:21.019> fun<00:04:21.140> and<00:04:22.330> it's<00:04:23.330> kind<00:04:23.539> of<00:04:23.570> a

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
it's fun it's fun and it's kind of a

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.029 
it's fun it's fun and it's kind of a
good<00:04:23.780> show<00:04:23.990> off<00:04:24.200> too<00:04:24.440> if<00:04:24.470> you<00:04:24.650> want<00:04:24.830> to<00:04:24.890> show

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.039 
good show off too if you want to show

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:26.500 
good show off too if you want to show
off<00:04:25.070> the<00:04:25.220> Raspberry<00:04:25.550> Pi<00:04:25.580> and<00:04:26.030> I<00:04:26.270> think<00:04:26.419> it<00:04:26.479> just

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
off the Raspberry Pi and I think it just

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.830 
off the Raspberry Pi and I think it just
really<00:04:26.780> demonstrates<00:04:28.539> it<00:04:29.539> just<00:04:29.690> really

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
really demonstrates it just really

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.270 
really demonstrates it just really
demonstrates<00:04:30.169> with<00:04:30.289> it<00:04:30.410> what<00:04:30.560> what<00:04:30.889> you<00:04:31.100> could

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
demonstrates with it what what you could

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.719 
demonstrates with it what what you could
potentially<00:04:31.370> do<00:04:31.760> and<00:04:33.190> so<00:04:34.190> anyway<00:04:34.430> so<00:04:34.490> I<00:04:34.639> hope

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
potentially do and so anyway so I hope

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.680 
potentially do and so anyway so I hope
you<00:04:34.850> guys<00:04:34.880> liked<00:04:35.120> it<00:04:35.240> and<00:04:35.479> have<00:04:36.380> a<00:04:36.440> good<00:04:36.590> one
