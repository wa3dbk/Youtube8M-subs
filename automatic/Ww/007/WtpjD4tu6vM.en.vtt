to have this nut back around just as a
good<00:05:15.750> starting<00:05:16.230> gauge<00:05:19.790> right<00:05:20.790> about<00:05:21.000> there

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
good starting gauge right about there

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:29.260 
good starting gauge right about there
the<00:05:21.600> other<00:05:21.720> nut<00:05:21.990> on

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.000 

like<00:05:29.750> that<00:05:29.960> lube<00:05:30.200> office<00:05:30.590> she's<00:05:30.770> still

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
like that lube office she's still

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:36.360 
like that lube office she's still
dripping<00:05:31.430> out<00:05:31.550> of<00:05:31.610> there<00:05:31.970> slip<00:05:32.570> our<00:05:32.780> cable

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:42.340 

into<00:05:37.370> there<00:05:37.640> I<00:05:40.210> need<00:05:41.210> to<00:05:41.240> create<00:05:41.960> a<00:05:42.110> little

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:42.350 
into there I need to create a little

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:48.310 
into there I need to create a little
more<00:05:42.500> slack<00:05:42.770> here<00:05:45.970> you<00:05:46.970> got<00:05:47.150> to<00:05:47.270> realize<00:05:47.450> that

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
more slack here you got to realize that

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.110 
more slack here you got to realize that
cable<00:05:48.950> I<00:05:49.010> just<00:05:49.220> took<00:05:49.340> off<00:05:49.580> is<00:05:49.760> probably

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
cable I just took off is probably

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.110 
cable I just took off is probably
original<00:05:50.690> and<00:05:51.170> it<00:05:51.830> has<00:05:51.980> probably<00:05:52.460> stretched<00:05:52.940> a

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
original and it has probably stretched a

00:05:53.120 --> 00:06:01.060 
original and it has probably stretched a
fair<00:05:53.420> bit<00:05:58.990> she's<00:05:59.990> up<00:06:00.170> there<00:06:00.320> gonna<00:06:00.560> have<00:06:00.740> to<00:06:00.890> do

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.070 
fair bit she's up there gonna have to do

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:09.850 
fair bit she's up there gonna have to do
some<00:06:01.310> adjusting<00:06:02.240> here<00:06:05.950> and<00:06:06.950> I<00:06:08.440> pretty<00:06:09.440> much<00:06:09.680> is

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
some adjusting here and I pretty much is

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.540 
some adjusting here and I pretty much is
it<00:06:10.420> so<00:06:11.420> do<00:06:11.570> some<00:06:11.750> fine-tuning<00:06:11.960> and<00:06:12.350> ya<00:06:13.190> see<00:06:13.490> how

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
it so do some fine-tuning and ya see how

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.670 
it so do some fine-tuning and ya see how
it<00:06:13.670> goes<00:06:13.850> okay<00:06:14.270> and<00:06:14.930> you<00:06:15.020> also<00:06:15.170> don't<00:06:15.440> want<00:06:15.620> to

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 
it goes okay and you also don't want to

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.350 
it goes okay and you also don't want to
forget<00:06:15.890> to<00:06:16.160> bend<00:06:16.340> that<00:06:16.490> little<00:06:16.730> locking<00:06:17.150> tab

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 
forget to bend that little locking tab

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.700 
forget to bend that little locking tab
back<00:06:17.660> in<00:06:18.400> annex<00:06:19.900> it's<00:06:20.900> pretty<00:06:21.170> sup<00:06:21.410> now<00:06:21.590> you
