about it so I don't know how much I'm

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.220 
about it so I don't know how much I'm
really<00:00:43.710> going<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.040> common<00:00:44.340> date<00:00:44.489> on<00:00:44.610> this<00:00:45.230> just

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
really going to common date on this just

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.860 
really going to common date on this just
that<00:00:46.500> this<00:00:47.250> one<00:00:47.489> will<00:00:47.700> probably<00:00:47.850> be<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.570> good

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
that this one will probably be a good

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.020
