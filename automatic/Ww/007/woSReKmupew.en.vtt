00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.470
 and well hello to everyone here is yves 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:19.060
 hinse tarology we find ourselves not 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:21.980
 on ps3 are not sure that the offer nor on 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:26.779
 for 11 2 because I'm going soon 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.580
 do a video nor on deutsche bank in 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:32.480
 I'm if I'm on my desk 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:35.390
 so it's for a little tutorial how 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.760
 improve the quality of its audio even 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.790
 if we have crap speakers that 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:44.750
 will increase the quality of the sound but it 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.430
 will drop a little volume so good it's 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.150
 no matter how much we can improve the 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.890
 quality me I prefer so so we go 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.559
 go directly on the internet 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:58.159
 I will put to read in the description 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:01:00.920
 so software looks like this here it 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:03.530
 costs 29 euros and we will have it 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.820
 free I will show you how we 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:10.340
 done so you clicked 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:13.310
 click here and clickair everything gives to 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.110
 audio essential crs good me I do it 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.650
 because I had them so we go 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:22.840
 leave both 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:25.500
 and crac is ddl forgiveness alleles either 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.700
 when you are in 186 so in 32 bits 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.330
 evening in 64 bits it's up to you to see 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.680
 so we will do 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:39.520
 we will install the 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:42.910
 we will close the page yes I can not 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.840
 I have a change I know but good 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:52.150
 we go straight on 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:55.020
 the installation does it yes that's it 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.020
 installed as usual 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.900
 next next unstable 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.700
 so in fact this software it creates a 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.830
 new audio device 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:15.560
 I explain to you there normally you 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:19.319
 when you click on his on material 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:24.620
 audio and sound you have several 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:27.719
 how to say you have several 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:31.260
 commands are multiple devices 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:35.040
 this is excuse me so normally there is 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.049
 this one is maybe another and your 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.439
 sound card if you have a card without 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.750
 stumble 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:42.120
 I think with the map are not 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.030
 need to install the software 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.120
 actually it'll create as you could 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.499
 to see it just before that it will create a 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.319
 new device 

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:58.000
 So I'll put in jail has 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:00.660
 so there you do 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.660
 dorthe 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:11.670
 facies even if it's not with klose 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:15.020
 application finish and we will restart 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:18.000
 the pc I find you right away 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:21.190
 go 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.020
 so here we go again with my pc that was 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.620
 restarted by the software 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:29.290
 so normally you had it installed 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.440
 all that i 'm going to shut up without doing 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.720
 expressly I'm going to die so here 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.330
 now how to have it all 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.790
 the functions actually but for free 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.760
 because they cost 20 euros I think 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.370
 this software so watch the begs if 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.090
 I change there he does not want so what 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.220
 you're going to do you're going to leave the 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.830
 window you will type in your 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:59.340
 research and programs services at 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:03.970
 get in you go get srs labs 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:08.140
 srs hd audio labs it is there 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:14.010
 stopped in time good people of some 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:17.799
 So here it is after that it's good 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:24.370
 so you're going to do on crack ddl 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:27.140
 you do extractor for the 64 bit 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:34.980
 so I think it will be 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:38.180
 here in the common files crs lab and 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:41.220
 you'll have a pretty wise audio thing 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:44.400
 labs ddl proxy i will show you that 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:49.110
 right now for the 64 in 64 bits 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:54.420
 so like a leaf this always srs 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:05:00.120
 labs ds but proxy here and so take 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:05:03.990
 the file in 64 and you copy it in 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:09.810
 the dspe and proxy makes move replace 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:13.440
 continue yes it's done tac you 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:18.620
 so leave there normally if I 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:22.010
 relaunch and labs essential audio labs 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.010
 if I change 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:31.029
 his load was waiting a little bit 

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:32.869
 so the time they set themselves up 

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:35.739
 the service star 

00:05:32.869 --> 00:05:35.739
 Yes 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:44.550
 and so everything works so I'm going 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.000
 get tested for example a 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.930
 music 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:53.060
 go on I'm going to put a music so the 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:57.630
 intro bf3 music at the room at 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:06:00.780
 listen without I got it wrong 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:03.900
 excuse me so here I'm going to put on 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:06.180
 speaker's like that there is the stereo and 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.990
 all this so after you can enlarge 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.990
 the window 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:15.780
 that's what I'm going to do right now 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:18.539
 that's ok so here at your leisure you 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:23.960
 can change what you want 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:23.960
 I put this because it is well 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:56.840
 on the video it does not change anything but in 

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:58.900
 true when you listen to yourself that you 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:02.000
 press the button on off it changes 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:04.180
 the sound I guarantee you that the sound is 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:09.500
 a lot better when you turn on the 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:12.169
 software has more and shape for for 

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:14.410
 keep my videos too go ciao bye 

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:14.410
