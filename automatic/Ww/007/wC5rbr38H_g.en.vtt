little things and then where I did was I

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:04.830 
little things and then where I did was I
got<00:04:59.650> like<00:05:00.039> an<00:05:00.250> individual<00:05:01.560> Ted<00:05:02.560> thing<00:05:03.570> it<00:05:04.570> was

got like an individual Ted thing it was

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.379 
got like an individual Ted thing it was
an<00:05:05.289> individual<00:05:05.979> battery<00:05:06.910> like<00:05:07.120> only<00:05:07.300> one

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:07.389 
an individual battery like only one

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:09.900 
an individual battery like only one
battery<00:05:07.870> came<00:05:08.080> in<00:05:08.199> the<00:05:08.260> package<00:05:08.610> so<00:05:09.610> I<00:05:09.639> just

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
battery came in the package so I just

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.310 
battery came in the package so I just
cut<00:05:10.090> off<00:05:10.270> the<00:05:11.250> round<00:05:12.250> part<00:05:12.430> that<00:05:12.639> it<00:05:12.760> comes<00:05:12.970> in

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
cut off the round part that it comes in

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.570 
cut off the round part that it comes in
you<00:05:14.320> cut<00:05:14.530> it<00:05:14.650> out<00:05:14.710> a<00:05:14.770> little<00:05:14.979> bit<00:05:15.099> so<00:05:15.400> that<00:05:15.430> it

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
you cut it out a little bit so that it

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.399 
you cut it out a little bit so that it
would<00:05:15.699> fit<00:05:15.909> in<00:05:16.030> the<00:05:16.240> cartridge<00:05:19.139> kind<00:05:20.139> of<00:05:20.229> that

00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:20.409 
would fit in the cartridge kind of that

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:24.080 
would fit in the cartridge kind of that
if<00:05:21.310> you<00:05:21.400> can<00:05:21.520> see<00:05:21.699> that<00:05:21.729> but<00:05:22.120> I<00:05:22.840> cut<00:05:23.260> it<00:05:23.349> shorter

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
if you can see that but I cut it shorter

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.210 
if you can see that but I cut it shorter
so<00:05:25.090> then<00:05:25.270> you<00:05:26.110> can<00:05:26.260> fit<00:05:26.440> around<00:05:26.560> it<00:05:26.860> so

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
so then you can fit around it so

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.909 
so then you can fit around it so
prevents<00:05:27.820> it<00:05:28.060> from<00:05:28.240> like<00:05:28.650> flopping<00:05:29.650> around

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 
prevents it from like flopping around

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:31.379 
prevents it from like flopping around
when<00:05:30.460> you're<00:05:30.580> like<00:05:30.729> carrying<00:05:31.120> ease<00:05:31.240> or

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
something and then you tape it down you

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.000 
something and then you tape it down you
can<00:05:35.860> use<00:05:35.979> any<00:05:36.190> type<00:05:36.400> of<00:05:36.460> tape<00:05:37.770> probably<00:05:38.770> accept

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.010
