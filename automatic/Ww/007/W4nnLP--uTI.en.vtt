with a honeycomb core this makes it

can burn very easily over here we have a

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:34.600

and<00:02:34.700> as<00:02:34.850> soon<00:02:35.030> as<00:02:35.060> I<00:02:35.210> start<00:02:35.510> putting<00:02:35.750> a<00:02:35.960> flame

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
and as soon as I start putting a flame

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.410 
and as soon as I start putting a flame
on<00:02:36.410> it<00:02:36.530> within<00:02:37.370> a<00:02:37.460> very<00:02:37.610> few<00:02:37.670> seconds<00:02:38.240> it

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
on it within a very few seconds it

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.260 
on it within a very few seconds it
catches<00:02:39.170> fire<00:02:39.200> but<00:02:40.130> not<00:02:40.250> only<00:02:40.400> that<00:02:40.550> it's<00:02:41.120> also

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
catches fire but not only that it's also

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.360 
catches fire but not only that it's also
giving<00:02:41.720> off<00:02:41.840> an<00:02:42.080> enormous<00:02:42.650> amount<00:02:42.950> of<00:02:43.100> very

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
giving off an enormous amount of very

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.210 
giving off an enormous amount of very
toxic<00:02:44.000> fumes<00:02:44.300> take<00:02:44.990> the<00:02:45.080> flavor<00:02:45.320> wave<00:02:45.560> and<00:02:45.920> it

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
toxic fumes take the flavor wave and it

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.550 
toxic fumes take the flavor wave and it
still<00:02:46.460> carries<00:02:46.850> on<00:02:47.000> burning<00:02:47.450> but<00:02:48.260> here<00:02:48.440> we

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
still carries on burning but here we

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.070 
still carries on burning but here we
have<00:02:48.710> exactly<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.580> same<00:02:49.790> material<00:02:50.030> which<00:02:50.960> has

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
have exactly the same material which has

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.690 
have exactly the same material which has
being<00:02:51.230> coated<00:02:51.560> on<00:02:51.680> one<00:02:51.860> side<00:02:52.160> with<00:02:52.460> just<00:02:52.640> a

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
millimeter or so at the new plastic now

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.980 
millimeter or so at the new plastic now
that<00:02:55.520> doesn't<00:02:55.820> add<00:02:55.940> very<00:02:56.120> much<00:02:56.240> weight<00:02:56.690> to<00:02:56.870> it

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
that doesn't add very much weight to it

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.580 
that doesn't add very much weight to it
but<00:02:57.470> it<00:02:58.400> does<00:02:58.730> give<00:02:59.000> it<00:02:59.120> enormous<00:03:00.110> protection

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
but it does give it enormous protection

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.650 
but it does give it enormous protection
against<00:03:00.950> fire<00:03:01.130> which<00:03:01.580> would<00:03:01.760> be<00:03:01.880> very<00:03:02.180> good<00:03:02.390> in

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
against fire which would be very good in

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.080 
against fire which would be very good in
a<00:03:02.900> fuselage<00:03:03.380> for<00:03:03.620> instance<00:03:03.920> there<00:03:04.730> are<00:03:04.760> other

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
materials that do a similar job but they

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.940 
materials that do a similar job but they
often<00:03:07.610> produce<00:03:07.910> toxic<00:03:08.660> fumes<00:03:08.990> or<00:03:09.260> smoke<00:03:09.530> which

often produce toxic fumes or smoke which

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.520 
often produce toxic fumes or smoke which
this<00:03:10.190> doesn't<00:03:10.910> or<00:03:11.270> they<00:03:11.870> can't<00:03:12.140> easily<00:03:12.320> be

egg it can be used meat as a coating so
how<00:03:21.650> is<00:03:21.709> it<00:03:21.800> doing<00:03:22.030> well<00:03:23.030> it<00:03:23.120> hasn't<00:03:23.270> broken<00:03:23.660> up

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
how is it doing well it hasn't broken up

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.420 
how is it doing well it hasn't broken up
at<00:03:23.930> all<00:03:24.110> and<00:03:24.290> you<00:03:24.709> can<00:03:24.830> see<00:03:24.920> on<00:03:25.010> the<00:03:25.070> front<00:03:25.280> here

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
at all and you can see on the front here

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.670 
at all and you can see on the front here
it's<00:03:25.580> glowing<00:03:25.970> red<00:03:26.239> hot<00:03:26.270> but<00:03:27.110> just<00:03:27.140> watch<00:03:27.440> this

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
it's glowing red hot but just watch this

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.050 
it's glowing red hot but just watch this
if<00:03:27.860> I<00:03:27.950> turn<00:03:28.160> the<00:03:28.280> flame<00:03:28.459> off<00:03:28.520> and<00:03:28.880> remember

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
if I turn the flame off and remember

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.550 
if I turn the flame off and remember
that<00:03:29.270> it<00:03:29.360> was<00:03:29.450> producing<00:03:29.840> 1,200<00:03:30.470> degrees

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
that it was producing 1,200 degrees

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.949 
that it was producing 1,200 degrees
Celsius<00:03:31.280> and<00:03:31.430> I<00:03:31.790> take<00:03:32.030> that<00:03:32.209> charred<00:03:32.540> bit<00:03:32.750> and

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
Celsius and I take that charred bit and

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.979 
Celsius and I take that charred bit and
I<00:03:33.170> put<00:03:33.380> it<00:03:33.470> flat<00:03:33.920> in<00:03:34.250> the<00:03:34.430> palm<00:03:34.610> of<00:03:34.640> my<00:03:34.790> hand<00:03:35.209> it

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
I put it flat in the palm of my hand it

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.789 
I put it flat in the palm of my hand it
only<00:03:36.110> just<00:03:36.320> feels<00:03:36.560> warm<00:03:37.070> and<00:03:37.840> if<00:03:38.840> I<00:03:39.110> then<00:03:39.290> crack

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
only just feels warm and if I then crack

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:40.270 
only just feels warm and if I then crack
it<00:03:39.950> open

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
it open
