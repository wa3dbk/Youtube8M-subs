00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:14.780
 the kryptonite to bad metropolises 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:16.909

 comics movies there are comics 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.190
 you knew there is a comic book company 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.310
 inside the movie or a company 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.530
 of fictional comics in this case is blas 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.210
 comics who is responsible for doing 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.759
 comics within the universe of 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.970
 superman are known to publish the 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:38.329
 adventures of booster gold interesting not 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.170

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.720
 laboratories are if you did not know in 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.330
 the comics the labs are are 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.399
 a technological and medical organization and 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.290
 They are responsible for creating safe the 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.710
 which is curiously confirmed for 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.909
 batman vil superman here we can see the 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.909
 building of said laboratories 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.220
 great you did not know this in krypton it 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.740
 can see the wrecked moon of western 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.690
 which brings us to jackson a 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.330
 Kryptonian sent to the ghost zone 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.180
 in the comics for flying that moon with a 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.120
 nuclear bomb in the movie jack south is 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.620
 the scientific assistant of shot like 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.060
 that in the movie there are many 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.790
 religious references fisherman and 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.590
 the director reminds you of someone 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.049
 He said it was necessary to give 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.569
 realism and make a superman more human 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:35.640
 they remember the soldier who answers 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.890
 at its greatest affirming that superman is a 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.350
 unattractive in his the report has 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.080
 embroidered the surname of ferrys wants 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.480
 carol ferris is the girlfriend in internal 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.180
 from the comics another cameo only the 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.760
 time will tell 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.739
 when favor to throw a clark with a great 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.930
 force this is impact on the box of 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.930
 security but it's not up to the staff 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.830
 now we understand it not super bad without 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.110
 Doubt is one of the most superheroes 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.300
 strong that exist but they also have 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.500
 feelings because you can see him cry 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.500
 in some scenes of the movie 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.860
 now we come to the interesting thing we know 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.920
 that director zack snyder also 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:46.200
 He directed 300 because we see a reference to 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.390
 his movie in the city ​​of small and of 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.319
 same way we see another reference to the 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.790
 movie watchmen supposedly 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:56.100
 supposedly in the next scene the 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.470
 henry cavill's face transforms into 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.750
 the christopher with whom for many 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.420
 it's the best super there's nothing official 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:06.840
 about these gentlemen but if you 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:10.560
 they want to believe it, but there's nothing 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.330
 official you knew this in the prequel comic 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.030
 that they released before the premiere of less 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.790
 til you can see keira who is prima 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.600
 of the superman and later it would be his 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:24.510
 back she travels to the land on the ship 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:28.350
 explorer that we will find 2000 not 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:32.190
 how many years twenty thousand years later what 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:34.840
 curious of the comic is that they want to achieve 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.150
 leave said capsule 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:41.880
 we see this in less useful we see it 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.880
 we see that the capsule is open 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:49.690
 capsule where I had to go then 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.640
 they obviously make us think that keira 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:55.720
 is on earth and that this one 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:59.140
 possibly frozen and that I think that 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.940
 is going to come out quite possibly in less than 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.610
 2 or in a future league of justice 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:08.090
 what do you think 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:10.520
 lex luthor lords the nemesis of 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:13.310
 superman par excellence that is 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:16.520
 confirmed for the movie batman and 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:19.699
 superman who curiously has 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:22.819
 many references to him through his 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:25.759
 company you fuck them in the movie them 

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:27.919
 Corts makes numerous appearances 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:29.780
 Throughout the film less hostile to 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:32.289
 then let's see them all what 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.289
 it seems to them 

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:46.909
 we know good if they did not know this 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:50.469
 movie is the beginning of the universe 

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:54.050
 cinematic says comics because 

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:57.050
 because there are references to the very same 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:59.959
 batman you did not know because we're going to 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:02.270
 check them all first on the satellite 

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:05.509
 that is destroyed you can see that 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.990
 belongs to companies wayne osea bruce 

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:09.849
 wayne 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.849
 or batman 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:20.000
 if you 're still not convinced of this in the 

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:22.520
 final battle also against shot is 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.020
 You can see a poster for brief briefs 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.030
 seconds and this is where it comes in 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.669
 perfectly what could be said 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:31.159
 my partner you have to pause the 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:34.340
 movie to be able to see the little ones 

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:37.939
 details can be seen by brief 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:40.069
 seconds a poster said poster says what 

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:43.129
 next translated into spanish and save 

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:46.520
 calm and call batman which we 

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:50.360
 perfectly says that Batman already exists 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:52.400
 in this universe and that's your card 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.550
 presentation and if you're not yet 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.919
 convinced easier batman work

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:04.389
