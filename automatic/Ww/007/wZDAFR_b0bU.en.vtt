00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:09.210
 Hello, now I want you 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:13.790
 tell one interesting tips for 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.790
 peaceful fish for roach and bream there perch 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.100
 very cheap 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:22.920
 here is an alternative model 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.720
 it turns out the model is very expensive there 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:32.630
 matchbox worth letting a dollar a 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.630
 here the dollar is worth a kilo of it 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.020
 nozzles 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.320
 it is with us 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.170
 gas 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.260
 cooking from him do all sorts of bulk 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:54.080
 things have not tried 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:59.080
 see this is not very fond of him here 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.080
 so this time already loves 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:10.770
 the back of my staff scares him by clicking 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:13.130
 and we shall bring out lust by this 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.130
 here 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.060
 for fishing this time you can still 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.540
 prepare for this we need 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.620
 food coloring 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.620
 that's what I found 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.020
 red dye 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.210
 here 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:39.079
 now we fill it up with it and time and he 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:43.329
 will get us more attractive such 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:43.329
 my view is not very important now 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:52.360
 We look around a lot and have to save 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.360
 something like this 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.340
 and with this piece there feminine round I 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:03.250
 there paid for it a penny 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:06.909
 I'll paint it for me will be a whole season in 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.280
 principle for 10 years would be enough but throw out 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.980
 then for a few kopecks I will buy another new one 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:17.250
 next season 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:17.250
 so we take the scissors 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.330
 we take a bag of dye only need 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.450
 watch that there was not any 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:31.420
 smells just dye that's what's there 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.460
 it is drawn on strawberry it probably 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.060
 just that color should be i chose 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:46.990
 what was brighter was there was another sweet cherry 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:49.120
 but it is darker look here you need 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:53.100
 use these dye shows for easter 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.100
 on eggs now 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.200
 I'll report you a noise 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.049
 very bright 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:08.540
 it is desirable of course that she does not hand 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:12.390
 hit now we try so to speak 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:26.280
 boa bag is probably enough for ten 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:31.050
 lives here sang a temple do not know about a friend 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:35.550
 like April to mode external on the hook 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:38.220
 it seems very home you so much as at depth 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:43.490
 from the type of shooting so far the model principle 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:48.140
 as it were, no longer move and that's it 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:50.300
 the wine chamber conveys all the beauty 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.350
 come here 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.660
 thing is all 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:59.820
 in which form is not all the same hand just 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:02.590
 colored a bag full of holes now another 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:07.000
 a couple of packs of paint is not just something 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:09.450
 somewhere your refrigerator and now this is mine 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.860
 will keep in the fridge 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.830
 I will overheat I will freeze it 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:18.100
 get to defrost choose yourself 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:21.720
 scissors cut small pieces 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:24.700
 and sits on the hook 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.310
 so if you didn't get moth or 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.700
 what is that here you should have 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:34.240
 in reserve 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:37.590
 sure it is not know milligram i 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.590
 spent dye 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.240
 good luck to you fishing strength good
