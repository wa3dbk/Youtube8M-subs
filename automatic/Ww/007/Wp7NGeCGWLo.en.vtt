even seen the EP m3 so basically what it
is<00:00:16.080> it's<00:00:16.830> similar<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.490> MK<00:00:17.730> 14<00:00:18.210> it's<00:00:18.390> a

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
suppressor with it it's a decent gun

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.580

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
than a lot of the other guns so just

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.400 
than a lot of the other guns so just
talk<00:00:36.059> about<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.329> EP<00:00:36.660> m3<00:00:36.899> what<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.140> comes<00:00:37.290> with

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
talk about the EP m3 what it comes with

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.190 
talk about the EP m3 what it comes with
as<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.620> 34<00:00:38.190> 34<00:00:38.610> 34<00:00:38.670> damage<00:00:39.360> profile<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:39.989> it's<00:00:40.140> a

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
as a 34 34 34 damage profile so it's a

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.319 
as a 34 34 34 damage profile so it's a
three<00:00:40.410> shot<00:00:40.440> from<00:00:40.829> every<00:00:41.190> range<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:42.000> can<00:00:42.149> see

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
three shot from every range you can see

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.479 
three shot from every range you can see
in<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.480> game<00:00:42.629> plate<00:00:42.930> here<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.710> does<00:00:44.040> kill

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
in the game plate here it does kill

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.990 
in the game plate here it does kill
decently<00:00:45.030> fast<00:00:45.620> obviously<00:00:46.620> it's<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.520> laser<00:00:47.760> gun

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
decently fast obviously it's a laser gun

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000 
decently fast obviously it's a laser gun
so<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.329> does<00:00:48.510> overheat<00:00:49.110> does<00:00:49.559> not<00:00:49.739> have<00:00:49.890> an

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
so it does overheat does not have an

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.600 
so it does overheat does not have an
ammo<00:00:50.219> clip<00:00:50.610> but<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:51.750> takes<00:00:52.079> 11<00:00:52.559> shots<00:00:53.160> before

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
ammo clip but it takes 11 shots before

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.299 
ammo clip but it takes 11 shots before
it<00:00:53.910> overheats<00:00:54.000> so<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.600> can<00:00:54.809> get<00:00:55.079> almost<00:00:55.469> four

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
it overheats so you can get almost four

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.799 
it overheats so you can get almost four
kills<00:00:56.610> with<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:56.820> before<00:00:57.059> overheating<00:00:57.629> but<00:00:57.750> if

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
kills with it before overheating but if

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.389 
kills with it before overheating but if
you<00:00:57.870> put<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.050> heatsink<00:00:58.410> on<00:00:58.590> it'll<00:00:58.829> take<00:00:58.949> 16

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
you put a heatsink on it'll take 16

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.220 
you put a heatsink on it'll take 16
shots<00:00:59.609> so<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.820> can<00:00:59.940> get<00:01:00.059> 5<00:01:00.270> kills<00:01:00.600> before

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
shots so you can get 5 kills before

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.020 
shots so you can get 5 kills before
overheats<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.070> it's<00:01:02.190> pretty<00:01:02.399> cool<00:01:02.579> but<00:01:02.789> the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
overheats so it's pretty cool but the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.390 
overheats so it's pretty cool but the
biggest<00:01:03.539> thing<00:01:04.350> about<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.650> upnc<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.129> makes<00:01:05.280> it

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
biggest thing about the upnc it makes it

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.800 
biggest thing about the upnc it makes it
a<00:01:05.430> really<00:01:05.580> good<00:01:05.790> gun<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.180> has<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.450> two<00:01:06.780> point

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
a really good gun it has a two point

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.520 
a really good gun it has a two point
nine<00:01:07.590> x<00:01:08.040> headshot<00:01:08.729> multiplier<00:01:09.350> which<00:01:10.350> is

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
nine x headshot multiplier which is

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.020 
nine x headshot multiplier which is
three<00:01:10.770> times<00:01:11.010> more<00:01:11.280> than<00:01:11.460> almost<00:01:11.610> every<00:01:12.000> other

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
three times more than almost every other

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.210 
three times more than almost every other
gun<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.479> game<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:13.320> if<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.560> shoot<00:01:13.860> in<00:01:14.070> the

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
gun in the game so if you shoot in the

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.969 
gun in the game so if you shoot in the
head<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.700> will<00:01:14.850> kill<00:01:15.210> instantly<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.830> has<00:01:16.950> a

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
head it will kill instantly so it has a

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.039 
head it will kill instantly so it has a
34<00:01:17.549> damage<00:01:17.850> profile<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:18.450> every<00:01:18.600> times<00:01:18.780> up<00:01:18.960> by

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
34 damage profile so every times up by

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.510 
34 damage profile so every times up by
two<00:01:19.110> point<00:01:19.560> nine<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.950> pretty<00:01:20.159> much<00:01:20.280> get<00:01:20.460> a

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
two point nine you pretty much get a

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.450 
two point nine you pretty much get a
hundred<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.869> it'll<00:01:22.619> kill<00:01:22.799> in<00:01:22.950> one<00:01:23.100> or<00:01:23.280> two

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
hundred so it'll kill in one or two

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.010 
hundred so it'll kill in one or two
shots<00:01:23.670> if<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.150> had<00:01:24.330> shot<00:01:24.540> them<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:24.900> which

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
shots if you had shot them that which

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.490 
shots if you had shot them that which
makes<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.409> absolutely<00:01:25.560> insane<00:01:26.100> gun<00:01:26.400> but<00:01:27.500> the

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
makes it absolutely insane gun but the

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.929 
makes it absolutely insane gun but the
two<00:01:28.740> elite<00:01:29.070> guns<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.520> were<00:01:29.610> going<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.820> talk

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
e PM 3 parsec so time at the bonafide

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.960 
e PM 3 parsec so time at the bonafide
first<00:01:34.740> comes<00:01:35.009> with<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.189> plus<00:01:35.430> or<00:01:35.579> actually

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
first comes with a plus or actually

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.440 
first comes with a plus or actually
minus<00:01:36.930> two<00:01:37.140> damage<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.770> minus<00:01:38.070> one<00:01:38.250> fari<00:01:38.549> so

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
minus two damage and a minus one fari so

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.210 
minus two damage and a minus one fari so
obviously<00:01:39.930> minus<00:01:40.229> 2<00:01:40.350> damage<00:01:40.619> is<00:01:40.890> only<00:01:41.040> gonna

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
obviously minus 2 damage is only gonna

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.240 
obviously minus 2 damage is only gonna
make<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.700> mid<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.570> long<00:01:42.899> range<00:01:43.140> down<00:01:43.439> one<00:01:43.770> so

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
make the mid and long range down one so

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.069 
make the mid and long range down one so
make<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.700> fourth<00:01:44.970> shot<00:01:45.180> from<00:01:45.390> mid<00:01:45.570> range<00:01:45.780> and

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
make it a fourth shot from mid range and

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.450 
make it a fourth shot from mid range and
a<00:01:46.140> four<00:01:46.350> shot<00:01:46.530> from<00:01:46.710> long<00:01:46.890> range<00:01:46.920> not<00:01:47.280> really

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
a four shot from long range not really

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.149 
a four shot from long range not really
that<00:01:47.520> big<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.820> deal<00:01:47.970> but<00:01:48.619> the<00:01:49.619> minus<00:01:49.860> on<00:01:49.950> fire

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
that big of a deal but the minus on fire

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.310 
that big of a deal but the minus on fire
I<00:01:50.189> can<00:01:50.430> make<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.670> overheat<00:01:51.030> 10%<00:01:51.689> faster<00:01:51.930> so

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
I can make it overheat 10% faster so

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.810 
I can make it overheat 10% faster so
it'll<00:01:52.439> overheat<00:01:52.740> in<00:01:52.950> ten<00:01:53.159> shots<00:01:53.369> instead<00:01:53.670> of

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
it'll overheat in ten shots instead of

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.160 
it'll overheat in ten shots instead of
eleven<00:01:54.119> which<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.299> actually<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.869> pretty<00:01:55.049> big

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
eleven which is actually a pretty big

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.370 
eleven which is actually a pretty big
negative<00:01:55.590> on<00:01:55.680> this<00:01:55.799> gun<00:01:56.100> so<00:01:56.729> best<00:01:57.630> overall

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
negative on this gun so best overall

it is optical attachments you only put

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.810 
it is optical attachments you only put
red<00:02:35.970> dot<00:02:36.150> or<00:02:36.330> anything<00:02:36.780> like<00:02:37.080> that<00:02:37.140> on<00:02:37.410> it<00:02:37.440> but

only having optical attachments is a

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.110 
only having optical attachments is a
huge<00:03:03.300> negative<00:03:03.570> for<00:03:04.020> me<00:03:04.170> but<00:03:04.950> with<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:05.730> +2

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
huge negative for me but with the +2

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.900 
huge negative for me but with the +2
grain<00:03:06.330> just<00:03:06.480> gonna<00:03:06.720> help<00:03:06.900> it<00:03:07.020> out<00:03:07.080> a<00:03:07.140> lot<00:03:07.350> so

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
grain just gonna help it out a lot so

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.040 
grain just gonna help it out a lot so
compare<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.060> two<00:03:09.209> guns<00:03:09.480> head-to-head<00:03:09.959> you

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
compare the two guns head-to-head you

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.960 
compare the two guns head-to-head you
can<00:03:10.170> see<00:03:10.290> on<00:03:10.350> your<00:03:10.380> screen<00:03:10.530> here<00:03:10.739> the<00:03:11.670> damage

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
can see on your screen here the damage

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.270 
can see on your screen here the damage
is<00:03:12.270> obviously<00:03:12.600> one<00:03:12.750> of<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.900> parsec<00:03:13.440> bonafide

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
is obviously one of the parsec bonafide

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.280 
is obviously one of the parsec bonafide
takes<00:03:14.550> accuracy<00:03:15.090> parsec<00:03:15.630> takes<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:16.050> range

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
takes accuracy parsec takes the range

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.979 
takes accuracy parsec takes the range
the<00:03:16.530> parsec<00:03:17.100> takes<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.640> fire<00:03:17.970> rate<00:03:18.239> and<00:03:18.360> the

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
the parsec takes the fire rate and the

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.120 
the parsec takes the fire rate and the
hanging<00:03:19.230> them<00:03:19.410> while<00:03:19.500> building<00:03:19.709> on<00:03:19.860> them<00:03:20.010> is

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
hanging them while building on them is

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.789 
hanging them while building on them is
the<00:03:20.280> exact<00:03:20.580> same<00:03:21.019> the<00:03:22.019> intangibles

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
the exact same the intangibles

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.830 
the exact same the intangibles
goes<00:03:23.190> to<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.400> bonafide<00:03:23.670> because<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.360> parsec

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
goes to the bonafide because the parsec

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.509 
goes to the bonafide because the parsec
can<00:03:25.200> only<00:03:25.320> run<00:03:25.530> out<00:03:25.680> though<00:03:25.830> attachments<00:03:26.400> and

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
can only run out though attachments and

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.420 
can only run out though attachments and
tangibles<00:03:26.910> is<00:03:26.970> basically<00:03:27.299> that<00:03:28.200> extra<00:03:28.920> stuff

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
tangibles is basically that extra stuff

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.060 
tangibles is basically that extra stuff
that<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:30.120> gun<00:03:30.299> offers<00:03:30.720> so<00:03:30.959> bonafide<00:03:31.799> takes

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
that the gun offers so bonafide takes

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.729 
that the gun offers so bonafide takes
that<00:03:32.280> but<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.239> parsec<00:03:33.750> ends<00:03:34.140> up<00:03:34.230> taking<00:03:34.590> three

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
that but the parsec ends up taking three

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.259 
that but the parsec ends up taking three
of<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:34.980> categories<00:03:35.519> here<00:03:35.730> it<00:03:35.820> has<00:03:35.940> a<00:03:35.970> better

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
of the categories here it has a better

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.420 
of the categories here it has a better
fire<00:03:36.570> rate<00:03:36.780> more<00:03:37.170> range<00:03:37.470> and<00:03:37.709> a<00:03:38.100> little<00:03:38.340> bit

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
fire rate more range and a little bit

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.050 
fire rate more range and a little bit
more<00:03:38.580> damage

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
more damage

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.000 
more damage
bonafide<00:03:39.900> taking<00:03:40.290> two<00:03:40.530> and<00:03:40.739> they<00:03:40.799> are<00:03:40.890> the

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
bonafide taking two and they are the

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.000 
bonafide taking two and they are the
same<00:03:41.160> on<00:03:41.340> two<00:03:41.519> of<00:03:41.610> them<00:03:41.730> so<00:03:42.260> the<00:03:43.260> parsec

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
same on two of them so the parsec

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.580 
same on two of them so the parsec
you<00:03:44.130> know<00:03:44.250> on<00:03:44.459> paper<00:03:44.870> maybe<00:03:45.870> looks<00:03:46.140> like<00:03:46.290> a<00:03:46.320> bad

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
you know on paper maybe looks like a bad

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.580 
you know on paper maybe looks like a bad
gun<00:03:46.920> but<00:03:47.190> it's<00:03:47.880> actually<00:03:48.390> a<00:03:48.450> decent<00:03:48.720> version

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
gun but it's actually a decent version

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.259 
gun but it's actually a decent version
of<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:49.799> EP<00:03:50.100> m3<00:03:50.459> so<00:03:50.640> if<00:03:50.700> you<00:03:50.820> guys<00:03:50.910> don't<00:03:51.180> need

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
of the EP m3 so if you guys don't need

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.270 
of the EP m3 so if you guys don't need
