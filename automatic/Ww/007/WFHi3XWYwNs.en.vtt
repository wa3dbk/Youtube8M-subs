three things to watch out for here

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.880 
three things to watch out for here
number<00:01:07.850> one<00:01:08.210> the<00:01:08.869> reason<00:01:08.900> that<00:01:09.500> you<00:01:09.740> are

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
number one the reason that you are

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
hands when you do the movement is that

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.649 
hands when you do the movement is that
the<00:01:14.869> annual<00:01:15.110> grip<00:01:15.560> will<00:01:15.890> be<00:01:16.040> narrower<00:01:16.880> and<00:01:17.150> the

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
the annual grip will be narrower and the

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.109 
the annual grip will be narrower and the
narrower<00:01:18.020> your<00:01:18.350> grip<00:01:18.710> is<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.549> more

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
narrower your grip is the more

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.109 
narrower your grip is the more
involvement<00:01:20.659> comes<00:01:21.290> from<00:01:21.710> your<00:01:21.950> triceps<00:01:22.790> with

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
involvement comes from your triceps with

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.960 
involvement comes from your triceps with
wider<00:01:23.420> grips<00:01:23.810> you<00:01:24.259> have<00:01:24.500> more<00:01:24.920> work<00:01:25.369> coming

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
wider grips you have more work coming

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.440 
wider grips you have more work coming
from<00:01:26.119> the<00:01:26.750> chest<00:01:27.100> number<00:01:28.100> two<00:01:28.390> this<00:01:29.390> is

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
from the chest number two this is

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.230 
from the chest number two this is
related<00:01:30.200> to<00:01:30.289> number<00:01:30.619> one<00:01:30.940> don't<00:01:31.940> get<00:01:32.119> your

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
related to number one don't get your

elbows flare out to the sides already do

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.600 
elbows flare out to the sides already do
the<00:01:35.390> movement<00:01:35.899> because<00:01:36.679> the<00:01:36.950> more<00:01:37.220> you<00:01:37.399> do

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610
