00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 now at the work table with professor cristian juárez we also 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.040
 accompany and with the ideas of my prices are working with a 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.040
 project for that region with internet and it's called magical realism 

00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:13.099
 they were arrested supposedly with us 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:14.879
 On the other hand, what is it about? 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:16.049
 magical realism 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.110
 well this point of magical realism is a proposal 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:22.000
 to do a talk show 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.550
 that will be disseminated only through the internet 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.419
 the disease in day is growing by leaps and bounds and that's why 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:30.880
 we see fit to be true 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.489
 or is it all doing a program just weekly with interview of people from the 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:35.240
 city 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.970
 and as we are also fashionable nowadays the topic of social networks the 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.910
 possibility that they will tell us to meet people who 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.769
 they are linked in some way 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:48.639
 between those to each interviewee we ask you to give us the name of other 

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:53.780
 three people to be able to interview so far we have recorded 9 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.000
 interviews and this bell center material until the end of the year that none 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.280
 interesting proposal to maintain and for more to rescue in some way 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.550
 people from here of saint nicolás that develops that be the culture in the 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.980
 journalism in sport in medicine 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.470
 this people 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.360
 people here are so tough that they obviously do something to make things better and 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.360
 already projected a low profile that does not show much in the media and other 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.500
 in this way we think we can rescue it and uploading it to the Internet 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.170
 to be able to see the 24 hours because this is a means that is going to be let's say as a 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.660
 archive and historical and we can go also allowed his life on the internet 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:31.870
 can be seen from ugt 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.240
 anywhere in the world 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.600
 and again percent in any schedule only good that has internet 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.900
 good percent the work does it jointly nicolás is who more the 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.810
 technical contribution all this will imagine to collect omen 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.670
 although this something or more than nothing to do or what is understood well rescue 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.180
 it was a bit the subject that is now very much talked about the subject of memory because 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.100
 good as today that person also must also say in 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.909
 Our city 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.510
 much of that you have to rescue those testimonies so good 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.750
 perea north formed file where it happened tomorrow can go to 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.919
 that file see what a certain person thought 

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:13.709
 or what is important what it would be to try to see how that person 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.999
 contribution was a partner and see what to think of society 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:20.579
 it is within its scope that's why very variable or magical realism also 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:26.430
 was a sportsman a politician can also from a person so the 

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:28.819
 Art journalism is very varied 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.810
 in what is trying to rescue more than anything from the testimony to humanize the 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.709
 person not so much ask him about his profession but rather humanized 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.299
 ask him question that many times one daily thing was asked 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:41.299
 formulate 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.359
 who does not know a professional home to the doctor and often knows his 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:50.699
 place of work and not that he thinks that I lodge has to what he thinks about the 

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:53.429
 determined policy problematic our city 

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:54.409
 the scores 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:58.919
 and the format that is this a television type interview of duration 

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:01.939
 determined that he acquired between unemployment rates 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:05.680
 they must cancel at work it is good we have been invited the house ticket of 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.730
 studies to the workplace by the radio taxi of san nicolás 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.749
 we wish the cameras a very small digital camera 

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:14.509
 and good also there is méndez 

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:17.569
 per cent we do not have the professional technique neither of us are 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.710
 professionals in the field is done there they made him cut of journalism 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:22.989
 the professional well 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.040
 She also expressed that we are also leaving little by little, she thinks that the issue 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.820
 will go and that the theme of the prada and more than that 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.459
 the idea is to rescue 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.050
 what the person thinks about the images obviously we are going to do 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.599
 close-ups we try to retract 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.939
 just the expression is a look of those people we interviewed 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.930
 but the important thing is what they say has said that Bielsa or the three before the 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.539
 cameras the president 

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:48.959
 abc says 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.879
 we go to the place we do not use a microphone nor do we sometimes use reflectors 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:57.339
 says although this in turn that may be the appointment with a library we do not want 

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:58.130
 nor madrid 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.749
 the private house will be very simple 

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:04.599
 and a person or the reflectors bar senna frames traces people with my 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:06.239
 heart and all that 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.549
 in the battered 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:11.939
 will talk about age case with very entertaining questions do not have to do only with the 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:14.779
 today but with the feelings 

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:18.669
 Maria had a study to meet characters of sentimentality 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:20.129
 nor the intimate 

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:23.440
 and since the site is going to be able to study southwest strong he 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.840
 well this is not just a problem every time is more magical realism has 

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:32.830
 a people that this is a mini now I remove that they expose in 2000 realism 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.529
 magic that you give between all together raise salam enter all the 

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:38.879
 supports that we have are going to spread 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:42.749
 emilio pettoruti his place of videos that is the biggest place that exists there 

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:44.939
 also with magical realism tb 

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:46.620
 and enter all companies 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.050
 and we are also emphasizing today the unhappy buck 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.199
 that facebook is a platform that is growing a lot dance my heart a lot 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:58.700
 people have facebook and we also spread it through that channel 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:02.600
 that social network that is very important so they can not see photos videos 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:07.580
 previous images of this exile draw more so the idea is to do something and 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.380
 something enjoyable that people can see it crazy to enjoy and know a mind already 

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:13.400
 we did these people again 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.910
 yes they act and do something for society but sometimes it is such 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.960
 we went percent is overlapped by a blanket of silence take out do not have a 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.250
 too high profile 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.800
 I do not understand him 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.889
 of that price of the gram of transformation follows 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:30.930
 maybe that's why we are with some progress there will be no advance 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.099
 and the good part of tomorrow would be the first amortization release of 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:40.520
 the first interview so he knows from twelve o'clock the night could 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.539
 could enter to observe that in the first interviewed magical realism and 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:47.029
 see to see what he thinks about 

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:48.499
 san nicolas and 

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:53.109
