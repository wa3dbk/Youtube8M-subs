into where it says personal hit security
now<00:00:26.410> of<00:00:26.530> course<00:00:26.740> this<00:00:27.010> will<00:00:27.160> only<00:00:27.280> work<00:00:27.430> if<00:00:27.700> you

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
now of course this will only work if you

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.140 
now of course this will only work if you
have<00:00:28.030> a<00:00:28.300> a<00:00:28.780> screen<00:00:29.350> lock<00:00:29.560> first<00:00:29.950> so<00:00:30.250> if<00:00:30.970> your

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
have a a screen lock first so if your

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.150 
have a a screen lock first so if your
lock<00:00:31.330> screen<00:00:31.360> is<00:00:31.690> not<00:00:31.780> secure<00:00:32.230> then<00:00:32.560> go<00:00:32.980> ahead

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
lock screen is not secure then go ahead

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.400 
lock screen is not secure then go ahead
and<00:00:33.340> set<00:00:34.120> it<00:00:34.240> up<00:00:34.360> with<00:00:34.540> either<00:00:34.690> a<00:00:34.840> pin<00:00:35.140> or<00:00:35.170> a

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
and set it up with either a pin or a

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.040 
and set it up with either a pin or a
pattern<00:00:36.340> to<00:00:37.030> go<00:00:37.120> ahead<00:00:37.180> and<00:00:37.390> get<00:00:37.660> that<00:00:37.690> started

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
pattern to go ahead and get that started

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.830 
pattern to go ahead and get that started
so<00:00:38.770> once<00:00:39.310> that<00:00:39.490> is<00:00:39.790> set<00:00:40.000> up<00:00:40.150> you<00:00:40.300> will<00:00:40.450> be<00:00:40.600> able
