to pull it out just a little bit just
like<00:03:51.430> that<00:03:51.609> right<00:03:52.150> there<00:03:52.560> and<00:03:53.560> then<00:03:53.739> duplicate

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
like that right there and then duplicate

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.729 
like that right there and then duplicate
it<00:03:54.489> one<00:03:54.669> more<00:03:54.910> time<00:03:55.209> and<00:03:55.599> then<00:03:56.290> take<00:03:56.530> it<00:03:56.560> to

right<00:04:08.560> there<00:04:08.919> and<00:04:09.099> then<00:04:09.220> duplicate<00:04:09.730> it<00:04:09.879> one

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
right there and then duplicate it one

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.680 
right there and then duplicate it one
more<00:04:10.359> time<00:04:10.690> now<00:04:11.940> click<00:04:12.940> on<00:04:13.150> and<00:04:13.359> now<00:04:13.510> it's

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
more time now click on and now it's

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.140 
more time now click on and now it's
going<00:04:13.840> to<00:04:13.900> be<00:04:14.079> white<00:04:14.699> and<00:04:15.699> then<00:04:15.879> you're<00:04:16.030> also

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
going to be white and then you're also

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.610 
going to be white and then you're also
going<00:04:16.449> to<00:04:16.510> want<00:04:16.570> to<00:04:16.750> take<00:04:16.870> that<00:04:17.049> down<00:04:17.349> to<00:04:17.380> the

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
going to want to take that down to the

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.289 
going to want to take that down to the
bottom<00:04:18.070> so<00:04:18.099> it's<00:04:18.430> underneath<00:04:18.699> all<00:04:19.060> your

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
bottom so it's underneath all your

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.420 
bottom so it's underneath all your
layers<00:04:19.780> of<00:04:20.109> foam<00:04:20.260> off

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
layers of foam off

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.930 
layers of foam off
and<00:04:21.579> it's<00:04:21.820> going<00:04:22.030> to<00:04:22.090> be<00:04:22.330> just<00:04:22.870> like<00:04:23.759> just<00:04:24.759> like

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
and it's going to be just like just like

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.900 
and it's going to be just like just like
that<00:04:25.000> right<00:04:25.600> there<00:04:26.100> and<00:04:27.100> now<00:04:27.310> the<00:04:27.430> last<00:04:27.699> step

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
that right there and now the last step

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.350 
that right there and now the last step
is<00:04:28.360> to<00:04:28.389> go<00:04:28.780> to<00:04:28.840> layer<00:04:29.110> two<00:04:29.530> and<00:04:30.210> you're<00:04:31.210> going

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
is to go to layer two and you're going

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.990 
is to go to layer two and you're going
to<00:04:31.389> want<00:04:31.660> to<00:04:31.690> go<00:04:31.900> to<00:04:31.960> page<00:04:32.560> let's<00:04:33.280> see<00:04:33.610> it<00:04:33.820> is

and now again if you want a background
you<00:04:51.729> should<00:04:51.970> have<00:04:52.210> one<00:04:52.509> layer<00:04:52.780> left<00:04:53.169> you<00:04:53.620> can

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
you should have one layer left you can

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.120 
you should have one layer left you can
make<00:04:53.979> a<00:04:54.010> background<00:04:54.370> so<00:04:55.590> that's<00:04:56.590> pretty<00:04:56.949> much

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
make a background so that's pretty much

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.310 
make a background so that's pretty much
it<00:04:57.400> for<00:04:57.520> this<00:04:57.669> tutorial
