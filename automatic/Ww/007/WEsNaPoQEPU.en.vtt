African restaurants is that something in

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.509 
African restaurants is that something in
the<00:02:38.290> future<00:02:38.410> that<00:02:38.620> could<00:02:38.830> come<00:02:39.010> around<00:02:39.099> I

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
the future that could come around I

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.220 
the future that could come around I
don't<00:02:39.849> think<00:02:40.030> so<00:02:40.209> I<00:02:40.450> think<00:02:40.720> we<00:02:40.780> will<00:02:40.930> stick

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
don't think so I think we will stick

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.800 
don't think so I think we will stick
with<00:02:41.440> it<00:02:41.560> because<00:02:41.819> it's<00:02:42.819> a<00:02:42.849> hard<00:02:43.000> job<00:02:43.090> it's<00:02:43.480> not

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
with it because it's a hard job it's not

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.870 
with it because it's a hard job it's not
easy<00:02:44.019> so<00:02:44.709> I<00:02:44.739> think<00:02:44.830> at<00:02:45.069> the<00:02:45.130> moment<00:02:45.160> we<00:02:45.489> stick

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
easy so I think at the moment we stick

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.170 
easy so I think at the moment we stick
with<00:02:45.910> it<00:02:46.180> and<00:02:46.330> the<00:02:47.170> plan<00:02:47.380> is<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:47.620> up<00:02:48.099> anymore<00:02:48.489> so

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180
