00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
the big features there well at least

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.770 
the big features there well at least
Apple<00:04:36.410> are<00:04:36.620> the<00:04:37.250> train<00:04:37.520> if<00:04:38.030> you<00:04:38.150> holdin<00:04:38.479> on<00:04:38.569> app

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
Apple are the train if you holdin on app

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.770 
Apple are the train if you holdin on app

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
so it starts wiggly jiggly and you drag

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.719 
so it starts wiggly jiggly and you drag
it<00:04:41.810> over<00:04:41.960> a<00:04:42.169> nap<00:04:42.349> you<00:04:42.770> see<00:04:42.949> their<00:04:43.160> ego<00:04:43.460> cinder

it over a nap you see their ego cinder

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:45.730 
it over a nap you see their ego cinder
folder<00:04:44.120> and<00:04:44.270> that<00:04:45.050> really<00:04:45.289> cool<00:04:45.470> thing<00:04:45.620> about

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
folder and that really cool thing about

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.159 
folder and that really cool thing about
this<00:04:45.919> is<00:04:45.979> that<00:04:46.190> it<00:04:46.970> actually<00:04:47.210> creates<00:04:47.690> a<00:04:47.990> name

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
this is that it actually creates a name

this is that it actually creates a name
for<00:04:49.009> the<00:04:49.130> folder<00:04:49.430> depending<00:04:49.940> on<00:04:50.090> the<00:04:50.270> apps

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
for the folder depending on the apps

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:52.150 
for the folder depending on the apps
that<00:04:50.569> you<00:04:50.750> have<00:04:50.840> chosen<00:04:51.020> so<00:04:51.620> if<00:04:51.740> I<00:04:51.830> put<00:04:51.979> that
