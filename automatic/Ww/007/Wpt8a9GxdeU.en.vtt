00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:19.830
 where it this is more of a Video 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:24.150
 channel 123 physics 1 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.490
 I already asked you at the beginning. 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.269
 This case like the video I did not like 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.879
 add your favorites today 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.330
 in this video I met him in some 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:40.190
 things about here in the easy stuffing 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.190
 Teach a thing about lotomania 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.850
 lotomania people you play against a hundred 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:54.420
 numbers you already with 50 have hit 20 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:58.860
 then the next you play a number 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:01.170
 more 51 52 43 54 years five numbers stays 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.269
 hundreds of cards I'll teach one 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.770
 way the next people are going and 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:11.400
 play with 60 numbers with 10 k she only 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:13.140
 In other words, you will play with your own 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.450
 I'm going to say a mistake but it's something that 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:23.759
 It always happens in the game that you go 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:30.469
 make on the card I'll show you 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:34.289
 here it works only scratching and vertical 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:44.159
 scratch any number 1 ie of the 101 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:54.509
 91 in the second card 2 92 from 3 until the 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:02:00.229
 end 4 streak all stay until the end 5 6 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:02.999
 7 8 9 10 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:06.859
 as we took so dating with 

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:11.280
 20 cards people will play this game 

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:15.600
 You will play 50 numbers but it will not. 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:19.910
 playing from number 1 91 hours and 50 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.920
 numbers here because he's playing with 60 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.590
 because the following they counting 10 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.710
 Are you playing with 90 is not it? 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.710
 thing 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.580
 She'll talk but that does not work. 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:38.040
 then I'll prove why it works 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:43.290
 suppose you give one more example 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:47.390
 I took the whole career from 808 to 98 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.349
 I played with the other 50 in the bank here 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.760
 You chose 50 here 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:58.019
 or I'll show you now 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:01.890
 The result here is this here is a 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:03.500
 day 23 draw the 20 numbers that 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:08.970
 gave 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:18.329
 we look at the number column 128 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:21.319
 training 450 277 gave no night already 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:28.049
 gave another already gave one of the seven no 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:32.630
 3d euro contest 6 as in urn with 2 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:35.099
 gave krona 3 none 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.579
 so for example if I caught the 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:37.579
 chart 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:44.549
 this one that I do not stretch the column 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:48.359
 I played none I would only play in others 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:52.769
 numbers understood fucking play then let's go 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:53.370
 pick up the game will be the video here in the column 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.569
 1 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:59.910
 gave no number and also in the 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.560
 vertical or horizontal also did not 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.109
 There are no numbers here but the 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.109
 horizontal is very difficult not to give 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:11.060
 no one ever loses one or two worlds 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:11.060
 Let's go, contest 16 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:19.380
 column 6 gave no number then it is 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:19.380
 this happens almost directly 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:26.800
 column 4 gave no number 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:33.220
 then on average each two three three 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:36.669
 five six six type contest on average 5 67 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.139
 he will give one that will not 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.850
 will have space 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:43.800
 Of course you will lose a number only. 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:46.030
 remedy does not pay pack player 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:50.949
 military playing against a hundred numbers 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:53.650
 took into account 90 understood clearly that 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:56.669
 if you want to do it because it only gives 10 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.570
 but if you want to 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:00.699
 horizontal 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.160
 only that the multiplication of 10 by 10 of the 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:06.190
 password and will pass in card and is 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:09.580
 difficult to give a case that does not rain 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:13.229
 here has none in column 1 to 1 and 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:16.870
 you have none in the body column of 40 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:18.940
 right here would be playing with 80 is is a 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:23.830
 70 numbers that if I can play with 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:24.610
 80 eighty numbers he is accurate 18 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.740
 points 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:31.870
 so here for now they 're playing 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:35.199
 with 67 you can do it here people can 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:39.220
 compare each on average 67 contest it 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:45.310
 gives practically all the games 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:47.349
 he gives with a column a column in 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:50.530
 vertical and ltda 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:54.099
 missing all number for 78 is going 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:55.150
 end up giving them all but it is highly 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:06:00.690
 viable 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:00.690
 good people liked the favorites there
