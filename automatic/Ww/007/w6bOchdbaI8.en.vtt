00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.420
 special this video is dedicated to 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.090

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.070
 iztapa zihuatanejo again many 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.579
 Thank you for having attended this event 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.499
 Friday April 26 was a 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:17.689
 pleasure as much as I know how to make of brunette 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:19.490
 We appreciate your presence and therefore 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.660
 obviously there are many things that you 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.060
 we would have loved 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.980
 sharing time was very limited 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.400
 we had to teach you the basics of what 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.860
 basic so you can start creating your 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.930
 structure of an ideal perfect shape 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.700
 so you can develop that health to 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.860
 proof of diseases and obviously 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.800
 reverse any type of problem 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.989
 disease is what you call it 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.239
 I mentioned literally very briefly the 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.879
 the benefits of probiotics for 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.949
 me until now if only I could 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.379
 choose a supplement that you saw in 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:54.210
 a very hypothetical situation and I would say that 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.730
 probiotics for all the manifolds 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.010
 benefits and today I love you 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.890
 share something added to that the 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.350
 probiotics just the day we came from 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.270
 I return the morillo adviser 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.460
 we realized that the trees of 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.320
 tamarind mangoes the coconuts are 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.350
 falling many of them are throwing 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.970
 lose because then there are some that 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.910
 they sell to the road but there are others that 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.860
 simply nobody nobody pick it up 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.690
 then the abundant I made some 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.750
 basic principles of life always 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:28.140
 there is to share that the distribution 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.300
 is wrong or is not in your hands 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.300
 there is no abundance there is always abundance 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.000
 this time I want to show you something 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.680
 that will cover 34 points at the same 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.560
 time and it's a win-win situation 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.750
 for everyone first of all when we 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.180
 we smelled on the road we stopped to 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.330
 eat some mangoes that were there and 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.240
 only in a radius of 2 to 3 meters 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:53.280
 there were more than 20 mangoes pulled me in that 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.890
 moment I ate some we uploaded others 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.259
 to take but the detail is this one 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.930
 the fruits are very important for several 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.300
 aspects however the same and if you 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.280
 adventures to go find those foods 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.320
 that they are spoiling their mangoes 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.179
 the tamarinds and so on can you 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.039
 spoil many in the house not 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.860
 so I want to show you a little 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.930
 technique for how to make them be preserved 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.140
 for weeks said foods and 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.420
 have the mega plus the mega advantage of 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.600
 that you can get a super dose of 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.010
 probiotics in such foods what 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.470
 I just did today is I grabbed 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.120
 some organic mangoes by the way 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.540
 what I just did is simply 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.079
 cut to the meat 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.090
 I cut the meat and put it in certain 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:40.310
 glass containers not what it does is 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.409
 is what you put in your blender whatever 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.269
 have briefly what you do with 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:46.269
 the meat is liquefying the cndh 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.320
 well not much what it requires is the 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.390
 mango and rich in water what it does is in 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.480
 this case is always what you are going to use 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.060
 It's glass or ceramic containers 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.520
 ceramic non-metal plastic glass okay 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.440
 it may happen but it is not the best option 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.360
 metal not tell because everything 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.240
 does it's just pour your mashed 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.220
 mango in this case I decided to use mango 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.230
 because that's what I found without 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.360
 however you can do it you can do 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.850
 the same with coconut meat and meat 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.070
 of the tamarind literally with any 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.430
 fruit you can do the same thing now that 's 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:27.500
 the super secret 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.030
 the probiotics that I recommend that 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.150
 are on my page are probiotics 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.739
 markova please read the article there is a 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.140
 world of benefits with these 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.209
 probiotics first of all whoever 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.370
 does these probiotics to the market doctor 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.349
 is the doctor of h is the highest authority 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.879
 in fact he is the president of the 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.700
 association of probiotics throughout 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:49.219
 world and he has a special kind 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.769
 which is called lactobacilli from ds 1 which is 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:54.129
 the most powerful that is known is capable 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:57.439
 alone to eradicate coli 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:04:00.169
 clostridium botulinum salmonella anthrax and 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:01.790
 among other diseases very, very 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:03.439
 difficult to fight 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.780
 then this is the magic look here and 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:07.340
 here's the trick when you put the 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.400
 puree in your glass container or 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:13.280
 pottery you will try to leave a 20 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.870
 percent of free margin on the bottle in 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.329
 any of the bottles not in this 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.400
 case there are approximately 20 per 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.889
 percent because this is what we're going to 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.259
 make the capsules of the probiotics the 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:27.229
 you are going to pour into what are being the 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:29.090
 containers together with the fruit that is what 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:31.849
 what are we going to do this is called in 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.349
 certain cultures call it kefir 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:36.860
 simply what we are going to do is 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:38.270
 ferment the fruit that makes it 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.550
 I just put the dust of the 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:44.719
 probiotic and with a spoon not of 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:47.839
 metal again whether it's wood either 

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:50.360
 plastic what is going to be is would be 

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:52.539
 stir it then hold a little 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.539
 there 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.360
 and I have lacked the spoon 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:00.990
 so what I do is simply 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:04.810
 stir well the probiotic powder 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.669
 inside the mango cream that I know 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:10.660
 that makes so much game but keith do it in 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:12.280
 home try not to stir us one and 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.349
 finally you stir the other side 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.000
 try to make it look good but come up 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:17.979
 the bottom what is being the dust the 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.280
 probiotic that you grab all the cream and 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:24.400
 not only stay on top or in the 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:27.460
 spoon you go well and now the point 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:30.820
 final is extremely simple tapas these 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.860
 containers but do not tighten them part 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.919
 of the fermentation of the fruit in this 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:38.710
 case an oxygenation is going to be required if 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:41.139
 you fill the container completely 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.699
 can come to regret and throw 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:44.770
 everything if next to it is part of the 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:46.360
 fermentation the sugars are going to 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.919
 convert something many of them into your 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.509
 mostly in acid 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:52.570
 that you'll make them keep the 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:54.190
 fruit for weeks in the fridge and the 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.930
 is this process once 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.060
 you did this and liquefy it you already have it 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.460
 in your containers you already put the 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.540
 probiotics what you do is simply 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.780
 leave it 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:08.140
 room temperature in a bag where 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.970
 do not hit the light around 24 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.740
 hours between the warmer place 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:14.320
 the more heat you usually make 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.780
 it requires less time but between 16 to 24 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:20.040
 hours is optimal and leave out of it 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:22.690
 after it is fermented the uncover 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:25.390
 the tests if you want if it's already the 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:27.400
 proper fermentation from that 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:29.710
 point you can save them in the fridge 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.720
 that can last literally weeks 34 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:33.880
 weeks have a chance to lose the 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.550
 fermentation process follows very but 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.840
 very slowly but still and that's a 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.910
 way you can give your 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.310
 families especially children something 

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:44.260
 extremely exquisite and with a world of 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:47.500
 benefits such as probiotics 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:49.300
 for again read on my page the 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.610
 ingredients of what are being the 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.900
 mercola probiotics that I recommend that 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:56.560
 is everything they do you are going to find 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:58.810
 What a wow they are, and I want 

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.510
 clarify that if for example a capsule 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:03.850
 of these probiotics has 35 billion and 

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:06.070
 you put it on the fruit they are not going to 

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:07.650
 make 35 million when you get the 

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.990
 final product are 

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:11.430
 because the same fermentation makes 

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:14.370
 keep growing and growing and growing 

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:16.470
 and just a spoonful of this 

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:18.120
 after its fermentation stage that 

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:20.669
 can provide around 20 

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:23.400
 trillions of bacteria with only one 

00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:25.080
 spoonful and now imagine how you can 

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:27.419
 make it play and play 

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.520
 and reproduce and in a very but 

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:30.600
 very pleasant highly delicious and 

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.060
 nutritious 

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:35.310
 so that's my recommendation on the day 

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:37.380
 today I wanted to record this video because 

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:39.090
 I knew that I know I had not detailed so much 

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:41.280
 in probiotics and why immediately 

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:43.560
 find me a way back in the 

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:46.110
 road how you could share it 

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:48.750
 everything happens for something in short 

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:50.820
 try it and I'm sure you're going to 

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:52.530
 be ecstatic with the taste and 

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:54.870
 benefits you're going to start having better
