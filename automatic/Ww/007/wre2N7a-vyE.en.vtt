we're<00:00:10.679> here<00:00:10.889> with<00:00:11.040> Beauvais<00:00:11.429> in<00:00:11.580> 2014<00:00:12.420> looking

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
we're here with Beauvais in 2014 looking

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.509 
we're here with Beauvais in 2014 looking
at<00:00:12.780> some<00:00:12.960> of<00:00:12.990> their<00:00:13.139> new<00:00:13.290> watches<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:14.190> they

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
at some of their new watches and they

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.060 
at some of their new watches and they
are<00:00:14.639> beautiful<00:00:15.089> this<00:00:15.780> is<00:00:16.109> probably<00:00:16.830> one<00:00:16.980> of<00:00:17.010> my

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
are beautiful this is probably one of my

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.000 
are beautiful this is probably one of my
favorites<00:00:17.810> it's<00:00:18.810> in<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.020> recital<00:00:19.500> collection

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
favorites it's in the recital collection

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.550 
favorites it's in the recital collection
and<00:00:20.220> this<00:00:21.180> would<00:00:21.480> be<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:21.990> guess<00:00:22.260> for<00:00:22.470> them

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
and this would be I guess for them

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.910 
and this would be I guess for them
ultra-thin<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.369> movement<00:00:23.850> is<00:00:24.439> about<00:00:25.439> three

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
ultra-thin the movement is about three

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.460 
ultra-thin the movement is about three
and<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:26.130> half<00:00:26.160> millimeters<00:00:26.760> thick<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.900> case<00:00:28.170> is

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
and a half millimeters thick the case is

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.050 
and a half millimeters thick the case is
just<00:00:28.769> over<00:00:29.039> seven<00:00:29.369> millimeters<00:00:29.820> thick<00:00:30.029> and

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
just over seven millimeters thick and

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.519 
just over seven millimeters thick and
this<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.570> thinnest<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.170> recital

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
this is the thinnest of the recital

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.650 
this is the thinnest of the recital
watches<00:00:32.040> they've<00:00:32.399> had<00:00:32.610> in<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.880> recital<00:00:33.239> 12

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
watches they've had in the recital 12

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.049 
watches they've had in the recital 12
the<00:00:34.620> movement<00:00:35.040> is<00:00:35.160> stunningly<00:00:35.610> beautiful

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
the movement is stunningly beautiful

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:36.830 
the movement is stunningly beautiful
it's<00:00:36.180> just<00:00:36.239> gorgeous

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
it's just gorgeous

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
you have an off centered display for the

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.220 
you have an off centered display for the
time<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:40.100> special<00:00:41.100> seconds<00:00:41.809> counter<00:00:42.809> there<00:00:43.020> and

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
time a special seconds counter there and

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.560 
time a special seconds counter there and
it's<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.649> patented<00:00:43.860> system<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:45.030> allows<00:00:45.329> you

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
it's a patented system that allows you

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.200 
it's a patented system that allows you
to<00:00:45.600> see<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.870> seconds<00:00:46.410> from<00:00:47.100> both<00:00:47.520> sides<00:00:47.910> so

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
to see the seconds from both sides so

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.400 
to see the seconds from both sides so
that<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.390> can<00:00:48.510> go<00:00:48.600> all<00:00:48.750> through<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.020> movement

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
that you can go all through the movement

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.529 
that you can go all through the movement
it's<00:00:49.739> not<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:49.980> turbine<00:00:50.399> but<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.390> an

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
it's not a turbine but it is an

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.110 
it's not a turbine but it is an
interesting<00:00:51.750> interpretation<00:00:52.190> of<00:00:53.190> how<00:00:53.940> they

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
interesting interpretation of how they

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.389 
interesting interpretation of how they
do<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.629> seconds<00:00:55.379> indication<00:00:55.860> on<00:00:56.010> the

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
do the the seconds indication on the

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.180 
do the the seconds indication on the
back<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.820> launch<00:00:57.620> you<00:00:58.620> have<00:00:58.800> more<00:00:59.039> of<00:00:59.100> the

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
back of the launch you have more of the

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.439 
back of the launch you have more of the
movements<00:00:59.579> very<00:00:59.640> very<00:00:59.910> beautiful<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.359> then

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
movements very very beautiful and then

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.540 
movements very very beautiful and then
you<00:01:00.480> also<00:01:00.660> have<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:01.170> believe<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:01.980> power<00:01:02.250> serve

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
you also have I believe a power serve

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.969 
you also have I believe a power serve
indicator<00:01:02.940> yes<00:01:03.120> right<00:01:03.660> up<00:01:03.780> here<00:01:04.049> this<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.920> a

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
indicator yes right up here this is a

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.130 
indicator yes right up here this is a
timepiece<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.549> is<00:01:05.850> both<00:01:06.299> classic<00:01:06.900> but<00:01:07.049> of

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
timepiece that is both classic but of

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.289 
timepiece that is both classic but of
course<00:01:07.350> emphasizes<00:01:08.299> traditional

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
course emphasizes traditional

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.210 
course emphasizes traditional
watchmaking<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.020> way<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.350> find<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:11.189> be

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
watchmaking in a way that I find to be

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.740 
watchmaking in a way that I find to be
very<00:01:11.340> very<00:01:11.700> satisfying<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.420> does<00:01:12.540> have<00:01:12.720> a

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
very very satisfying it does have a

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.100 
very very satisfying it does have a
power<00:01:13.020> reserve<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:14.030> it's<00:01:15.030> either<00:01:15.180> 5<00:01:15.479> or<00:01:15.509> 7<00:01:15.840> days

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
power reserve of it's either 5 or 7 days

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.230 
power reserve of it's either 5 or 7 days
but<00:01:16.350> it's<00:01:16.680> quite<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.890> long<00:01:17.100> time<00:01:17.310> just<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:18.030> very

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
but it's quite a long time just a very

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.109 
but it's quite a long time just a very
remarkable<00:01:18.570> watch<00:01:19.049> in<00:01:19.229> terms<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.530> wearability

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
remarkable watch in terms of wearability

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.850 
remarkable watch in terms of wearability
design<00:01:21.119> as<00:01:21.390> well<00:01:21.509> as<00:01:21.570> practicality<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.680> that's

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
design as well as practicality so that's

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.370 
design as well as practicality so that's
the<00:01:22.979> recital<00:01:23.369> 12<00:01:23.640> then<00:01:24.240> we<00:01:24.270> have<00:01:24.720> two<00:01:25.110> more

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
the recital 12 then we have two more

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.590 
the recital 12 then we have two more
recital<00:01:25.920> watches<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:26.369> year<00:01:26.670> we<00:01:27.240> have<00:01:27.420> this

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
recital watches this year we have this

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.039 
recital watches this year we have this
one<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.110> this<00:01:28.470> would<00:01:28.680> be<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.860> recital<00:01:30.049> 15y

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
one and this would be the recital 15y

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.870 
one and this would be the recital 15y
the<00:01:31.110> 15<00:01:31.650> whatever<00:01:32.009> happened<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.340> 13<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.729> 14

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
the 15 whatever happened to 13 to 14

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.149 
the 15 whatever happened to 13 to 14
well<00:01:33.270> interesting<00:01:34.020> note<00:01:34.380> they<00:01:34.619> decided<00:01:35.070> not

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
well interesting note they decided not

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.670 
well interesting note they decided not
to<00:01:35.220> make<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.520> 13<00:01:35.970> or<00:01:36.060> 14<00:01:36.390> because<00:01:36.570> its<00:01:36.840> lucky

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
to make a 13 or 14 because its lucky

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.440 
to make a 13 or 14 because its lucky
unlucky<00:01:38.070> numbers<00:01:38.549> somewhere<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.329> world

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
unlucky numbers somewhere in the world

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.870 
unlucky numbers somewhere in the world
so<00:01:40.140> this<00:01:40.320> one<00:01:40.500> as<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.740> can<00:01:40.770> see<00:01:41.040> is<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.340> thicker

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
so this one as you can see is a thicker

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.240 
so this one as you can see is a thicker
case<00:01:42.299> but<00:01:43.020> it's<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.229> more<00:01:43.350> complicated<00:01:43.740> watch

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
case but it's a more complicated watch

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.950 
case but it's a more complicated watch
and<00:01:44.520> what<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.700> have<00:01:44.909> here<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.360> we<00:01:45.810> have<00:01:45.840> a

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
and what you have here is we have a

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.420 
and what you have here is we have a
Turbie<00:01:46.320> onyx<00:01:46.680> they're<00:01:46.770> very<00:01:46.920> interesting<00:01:47.310> too

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
Turbie onyx they're very interesting too

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.780 
Turbie onyx they're very interesting too
or<00:01:47.490> beyond<00:01:47.780> although<00:01:48.780> I'm<00:01:48.899> not<00:01:48.990> Iturbi<00:01:49.380> on<00:01:49.790> you

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
or beyond although I'm not Iturbi on you

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.120

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
have the same type of seconds counter as

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.840 
have the same type of seconds counter as
you<00:01:53.670> have<00:01:53.939> on<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:55.110> recital<00:01:55.590> 12<00:01:55.920> but<00:01:56.640> it's<00:01:56.790> a

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
you have on the recital 12 but it's a

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.639 
you have on the recital 12 but it's a
little<00:01:57.000> bit<00:01:57.119> more<00:01:57.450> deep<00:01:57.750> because<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.290> is<00:01:58.409> a

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
little bit more deep because it is a

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.609 
little bit more deep because it is a
thicker<00:01:58.979> thicker<00:01:59.790> display<00:02:00.299> on<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.259> rear<00:02:01.500> of

thicker thicker display on the rear of

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.709 
thicker thicker display on the rear of
the<00:02:01.710> watch<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.250> can<00:02:02.490> actually<00:02:02.790> see<00:02:03.270> more

the watch you can actually see more

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.990 
the watch you can actually see more
depth<00:02:04.020> in<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:05.040> movement<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.700> can<00:02:05.850> see

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
depth in the movement and you can see

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.040 
depth in the movement and you can see
how<00:02:06.149> that<00:02:06.299> seconds<00:02:06.799> display<00:02:07.799> is<00:02:08.039> actually<00:02:08.640> on

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
how that seconds display is actually on

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.440 
how that seconds display is actually on
both<00:02:10.050> sides<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.009> movement

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
both sides of the movement

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.210 
both sides of the movement
is<00:02:11.569> kind<00:02:11.720> of<00:02:11.810> cool<00:02:12.050> here<00:02:12.560> you<00:02:12.709> have<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.010> power

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
is kind of cool here you have the power

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.030 
is kind of cool here you have the power
reserve<00:02:13.610> indicator<00:02:13.819> again<00:02:14.599> and<00:02:14.930> on<00:02:15.650> this

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
reserve indicator again and on this

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.070 
reserve indicator again and on this
model<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.910> time<00:02:17.180> is<00:02:17.420> displayed<00:02:17.569> in<00:02:18.050> a

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
model the time is displayed in a

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.960 
model the time is displayed in a
slightly<00:02:18.590> different<00:02:18.739> way

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
slightly different way

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.430 
slightly different way
retrograde<00:02:21.849> minutes<00:02:22.849> as<00:02:23.090> well<00:02:23.720> as<00:02:23.900> jumping

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.900 
pal reserve and we also have a triple
time<00:02:54.560> display<00:02:55.040> so<00:02:55.099> this<00:02:55.430> is<00:02:55.579> a<00:02:55.610> watch<00:02:55.880> that

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910

it's so cool to have these three dials

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.160 
it's so cool to have these three dials
move<00:03:07.220> in<00:03:07.459> synchronization<00:03:08.030> as<00:03:08.569> you<00:03:08.810> adjust

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
move in synchronization as you adjust

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.100 
move in synchronization as you adjust
the<00:03:09.290> time<00:03:09.700> just<00:03:10.700> it's<00:03:11.180> so<00:03:11.390> elegant<00:03:11.690> and<00:03:11.930> nice

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
have here the time you have a perpetual

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.330 
have here the time you have a perpetual
calendar<00:03:52.430> with<00:03:53.180> a<00:03:53.389> retrograde<00:03:53.930> date<00:03:54.470> and<00:03:54.799> you

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
calendar with a retrograde date and you

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.000 
calendar with a retrograde date and you
have<00:03:55.370> a<00:03:55.519> Turbie<00:03:55.910> on<00:03:56.060> also<00:03:56.630> you<00:03:57.230> have<00:03:57.769> another

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
have a Turbie on also you have another

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.099 
have a Turbie on also you have another
display<00:03:58.849> on<00:03:59.120> the<00:03:59.359> back<00:03:59.540> so<00:03:59.780> this<00:03:59.930> is<00:04:00.079> a

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:00.109 
display on the back so this is a

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:02.440 
display on the back so this is a
reversible<00:04:00.650> watch<00:04:00.920> so<00:04:01.459> the<00:04:01.609> case<00:04:01.849> actually

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
reversible watch so the case actually

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.050 
reversible watch so the case actually
can<00:04:02.660> you<00:04:02.870> can<00:04:03.019> flip<00:04:03.319> the<00:04:03.680> straps<00:04:04.069> around<00:04:04.310> to

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
can you can flip the straps around to

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.000 
can you can flip the straps around to
where<00:04:05.269> this<00:04:05.510> watch<00:04:05.750> either<00:04:06.049> way<00:04:06.410> you<00:04:06.859> have<00:04:06.889> a

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
where this watch either way you have a

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.909 
where this watch either way you have a
lot<00:04:07.340> of<00:04:07.370> hand<00:04:07.940> engraving<00:04:08.510> on<00:04:08.870> the<00:04:09.410> movement

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:09.919 
lot of hand engraving on the movement

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:12.220 
lot of hand engraving on the movement
it's<00:04:10.099> also<00:04:10.220> very<00:04:10.489> deep<00:04:10.849> movement<00:04:11.359> just<00:04:11.900> a<00:04:11.989> very

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
it's also very deep movement just a very

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.330 
it's also very deep movement just a very
nice<00:04:12.500> watch<00:04:12.889> to<00:04:13.220> look<00:04:13.489> at

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
nice watch to look at

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.120

a split second chronograph which we can

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.050 
a split second chronograph which we can
see<00:05:04.350> operating<00:05:05.310> here<00:05:05.460> so<00:05:05.610> we'll<00:05:05.730> start<00:05:05.910> the

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
see operating here so we'll start the

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.990 
see operating here so we'll start the
chronograph<00:05:06.510> up<00:05:07.220> now<00:05:08.220> you<00:05:08.280> see<00:05:08.460> that<00:05:08.580> red<00:05:08.760> hand

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
chronograph up now you see that red hand

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.670 
chronograph up now you see that red hand
there<00:05:09.210> which<00:05:09.360> is<00:05:09.480> a<00:05:09.510> split<00:05:09.900> and<00:05:10.110> then<00:05:10.290> you<00:05:10.410> push

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
there which is a split and then you push

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.910 
there which is a split and then you push
at<00:05:10.800> the<00:05:10.890> top<00:05:11.240> and<00:05:12.240> then<00:05:13.140> you<00:05:13.230> can<00:05:13.380> split<00:05:13.650> the

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:13.920 
at the top and then you can split the

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.070 
at the top and then you can split the
split<00:05:14.430> the<00:05:14.580> chronograph<00:05:15.000> time<00:05:15.180> power<00:05:15.690> reserve

split the chronograph time power reserve

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.170 
split the chronograph time power reserve
there<00:05:16.440> these<00:05:17.220> are<00:05:17.520> actually<00:05:17.820> interesting

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
there these are actually interesting

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.020 
there these are actually interesting
because<00:05:18.300> it's<00:05:18.570> actually<00:05:18.690> built<00:05:19.140> on<00:05:20.000> what<00:05:21.000> is

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
because it's actually built on what is

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.270 
because it's actually built on what is
essentially<00:05:21.450> a<00:05:21.600> base<00:05:21.870> 7750<00:05:22.860> of<00:05:22.980> course<00:05:23.190> they

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
essentially a base 7750 of course they

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.160 
essentially a base 7750 of course they
do<00:05:23.340> a<00:05:23.430> lot<00:05:23.640> to<00:05:23.850> it<00:05:23.970> and<00:05:24.060> a<00:05:24.120> lot<00:05:24.360> of<00:05:24.390> things<00:05:24.600> but

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:25.170 
do a lot to it and a lot of things but

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.600 
do a lot to it and a lot of things but
it's<00:05:25.380> interesting<00:05:25.680> to<00:05:25.920> see<00:05:26.070> just<00:05:26.250> sort<00:05:26.400> of<00:05:26.430> how

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
it's interesting to see just sort of how

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.990 
it's interesting to see just sort of how
far<00:05:26.970> you<00:05:27.450> can<00:05:27.600> take<00:05:27.900> the<00:05:28.140> 7750<00:05:29.070> and<00:05:29.280> this<00:05:29.670> again

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
far you can take the 7750 and this again

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.140 
far you can take the 7750 and this again
also<00:05:30.240> has<00:05:30.600> that<00:05:30.810> transforming<00:05:31.500> case<00:05:32.060> what<00:05:33.060> you

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
also has that transforming case what you

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.630 
also has that transforming case what you
do<00:05:33.270> is<00:05:33.360> you<00:05:33.450> can<00:05:33.600> open<00:05:33.960> up<00:05:34.020> the<00:05:34.080> back<00:05:34.350> here<00:05:34.830> take

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
do is you can open up the back here take
