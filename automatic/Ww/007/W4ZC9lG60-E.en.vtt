00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.559 

and<00:02:28.890> we<00:02:29.099> aren't<00:02:29.640> going<00:02:29.849> to<00:02:30.000> hit<00:02:30.120> this<00:02:30.269> LOI

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
and we aren't going to hit this LOI

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.259 
and we aren't going to hit this LOI
because<00:02:31.200> it<00:02:31.319> gets<00:02:31.439> a<00:02:31.530> little<00:02:31.680> messy<00:02:32.269> like

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
because it gets a little messy like

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.410 
because it gets a little messy like
technically<00:02:33.780> E<00:02:34.140> is<00:02:34.620> in<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.069> a<00:02:35.099> minor<00:02:35.579> chord<00:02:35.700> so

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
technically E is in the a minor chord so

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.850 
technically E is in the a minor chord so
