your TV age fills at the end of your
battle<00:01:09.560> depending<00:01:10.070> on<00:01:10.160> how<00:01:10.280> you<00:01:10.970> did<00:01:11.200> so<00:01:12.200> let's

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
battle depending on how you did so let's

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.890 
battle depending on how you did so let's

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
go ahead and see what information we

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.870 
go ahead and see what information we
have<00:01:15.260> we<00:01:15.290> can<00:01:15.680> see<00:01:15.890> that<00:01:16.100> the<00:01:16.280> enemy's<00:01:16.610> weak

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.860 
have we can see that the enemy's weak
against<00:01:17.150> fire<00:01:17.450> and<00:01:17.780> water<00:01:18.490> so<00:01:19.570> how<00:01:20.570> can<00:01:20.630> we

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 
against fire and water so how can we

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.600 
against fire and water so how can we
take<00:01:21.050> advantage<00:01:21.500> of<00:01:21.620> this<00:01:21.770> information<00:01:22.130> I

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
take advantage of this information I

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.630 
take advantage of this information I
wasn't<00:01:22.880> sure<00:01:23.300> at<00:01:23.479> first<00:01:23.509> because<00:01:24.369> I'm<00:01:25.369> only

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
wasn't sure at first because I'm only

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.790 
wasn't sure at first because I'm only
able<00:01:25.880> to<00:01:26.119> control<00:01:26.509> the<00:01:26.720> leader<00:01:27.020> of<00:01:27.350> this<00:01:27.500> party

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
able to control the leader of this party

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.690 
able to control the leader of this party
who<00:01:28.520> in<00:01:28.670> this<00:01:28.790> case<00:01:28.850> happens<00:01:29.090> to<00:01:29.570> be<00:01:29.660> lightning

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
who in this case happens to be lightning

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.390 
who in this case happens to be lightning
so<00:01:31.700> I<00:01:31.729> can<00:01:32.300> choose<00:01:33.170> her<00:01:33.410> attacks<00:01:33.800> but<00:01:34.070> how<00:01:34.250> do<00:01:34.310> I

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
so I can choose her attacks but how do I

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.550

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
and water attacks against well the nice

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:41.710 
and water attacks against well the nice
thing<00:01:40.250> is<00:01:40.280> if<00:01:40.550> you<00:01:40.670> look<00:01:40.700> here<00:01:41.150> you<00:01:41.270> can<00:01:41.450> see

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
thing is if you look here you can see

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.820 
thing is if you look here you can see
vanilla<00:01:42.320> and<00:01:42.680> saws<00:01:43.310> are<00:01:44.170> automatically<00:01:45.170> using

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
vanilla and saws are automatically using

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.969 
vanilla and saws are automatically using
fire<00:01:46.369> and<00:01:46.670> water<00:01:46.910> against<00:01:47.750> this<00:01:47.930> enemy<00:01:48.140> now

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
fire and water against this enemy now

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:50.670 
fire and water against this enemy now
that<00:01:49.220> we<00:01:49.310> have<00:01:49.430> gotten<00:01:49.820> this<00:01:49.910> information

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
that we have gotten this information

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.820 
that we have gotten this information
about<00:01:51.680> it<00:01:51.950> so<00:01:52.399> this<00:01:52.580> is<00:01:52.640> very<00:01:53.000> nice<00:01:53.270> this<00:01:53.479> is

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
about it so this is very nice this is

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.010 
about it so this is very nice this is
makes<00:01:54.830> this<00:01:55.009> a<00:01:55.070> lot<00:01:55.490> easier<00:01:55.729> you<00:01:56.360> don't<00:01:56.840> have

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
makes this a lot easier you don't have

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.260 
makes this a lot easier you don't have
to<00:01:57.170> micromanage<00:01:57.830> your<00:01:58.160> party<00:01:58.610> you<00:01:58.759> don't<00:01:58.940> have

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
to micromanage your party you don't have

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.260 
to micromanage your party you don't have
to<00:01:59.690> set<00:02:00.560> up<00:02:00.590> any<00:02:00.920> gambits<00:02:01.460> or<00:02:01.670> anything<00:02:01.940> like

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
to set up any gambits or anything like

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.970 
to set up any gambits or anything like
that<00:02:02.330> as<00:02:02.690> soon<00:02:02.720> as<00:02:02.960> you<00:02:03.110> get<00:02:03.259> this<00:02:03.410> information

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 
that as soon as you get this information

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.210 
that as soon as you get this information
reduce<00:02:05.980> but<00:02:06.310> this<00:02:06.880> is<00:02:07.030> a<00:02:07.060> very<00:02:07.330> neat<00:02:08.320> aspect<00:02:08.619> of

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
reduce but this is a very neat aspect of

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.410 
reduce but this is a very neat aspect of
this<00:02:09.369> writing<00:02:09.640> system

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.600 

so<00:02:13.930> you<00:02:14.020> can<00:02:14.170> see<00:02:14.350> this<00:02:14.470> was<00:02:14.710> very<00:02:15.040> effective

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
so you can see this was very effective

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.270 
so you can see this was very effective
and<00:02:16.330> we've<00:02:17.140> gotten<00:02:17.470> five<00:02:17.680> stars<00:02:18.040> in<00:02:18.220> this

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
and we've gotten five stars in this

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.940 
and we've gotten five stars in this
battle<00:02:18.730> so<00:02:19.180> let's<00:02:19.630> go<00:02:19.780> ahead<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:20.080> skip<00:02:20.740> to<00:02:20.800> a

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
battle so let's go ahead and skip to a

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.430 
battle so let's go ahead and skip to a
different<00:02:21.400> battle<00:02:21.760> I'd<00:02:22.420> like<00:02:22.600> to<00:02:22.750> show<00:02:22.959> you<00:02:23.020> a

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
different battle I'd like to show you a

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.490 
different battle I'd like to show you a
little<00:02:23.770> bit<00:02:23.860> more<00:02:24.160> about<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.550> system<00:02:25.500> so

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
little bit more about the system so

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.110 
little bit more about the system so
we're<00:02:26.740> choosing<00:02:26.950> a<00:02:27.160> tack<00:02:27.430> here<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:27.880> you<00:02:27.970> can

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
we're choosing a tack here and you can

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.120 
we're choosing a tack here and you can
see<00:02:28.330> that<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.690> first<00:02:28.900> attack<00:02:29.350> queued<00:02:29.709> up<00:02:29.800> is

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
see that the first attack queued up is

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.760 
see that the first attack queued up is
an<00:02:30.760> area<00:02:31.150> black<00:02:31.540> sand<00:02:31.990> the<00:02:32.110> second<00:02:32.470> one<00:02:32.560> is<00:02:32.680> a

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
an area black sand the second one is a

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.920 
an area black sand the second one is a
regular<00:02:32.950> impact<00:02:33.520> now<00:02:34.120> we're<00:02:34.270> choosing<00:02:34.480> attack

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
regular impact now we're choosing attack

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.840 
regular impact now we're choosing attack
again<00:02:35.290> and<00:02:35.470> this<00:02:35.530> time<00:02:35.590> we<00:02:35.920> get<00:02:36.070> three<00:02:36.459> regular

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
again and this time we get three regular

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.030 
again and this time we get three regular
attacks<00:02:37.209> queued<00:02:37.630> up<00:02:37.750> so<00:02:38.440> what<00:02:38.709> was<00:02:38.860> the

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
attacks queued up so what was the

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.500 
attacks queued up so what was the
difference<00:02:39.400> there<00:02:39.610> I<00:02:39.640> didn't<00:02:40.030> pick<00:02:40.239> anything

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
difference there I didn't pick anything

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.650 
difference there I didn't pick anything
different<00:02:41.080> I<00:02:41.140> chose<00:02:41.410> attack<00:02:41.770> both<00:02:42.070> times<00:02:42.660> what

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
different I chose attack both times what

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.830 
different I chose attack both times what
happened<00:02:44.140> was<00:02:44.380> the<00:02:44.800> game<00:02:45.480> determined<00:02:46.480> that

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
happened was the game determined that

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.990 
happened was the game determined that
there<00:02:47.290> were<00:02:47.590> enemies<00:02:48.100> grouped<00:02:48.400> together<00:02:48.550> and

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
there were enemies grouped together and

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.479 
there were enemies grouped together and
determined<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:49.900> lightning<00:02:50.350> had<00:02:50.590> a<00:02:50.890> group

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
determined the lightning had a group

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.300 
determined the lightning had a group
attack<00:02:51.820> and<00:02:52.230> in<00:02:53.230> that<00:02:53.440> situation<00:02:54.070> it<00:02:54.190> would<00:02:54.280> be

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
attack and in that situation it would be

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.340 
attack and in that situation it would be
best<00:02:54.670> to<00:02:54.820> use<00:02:54.880> that<00:02:55.209> attack<00:02:55.330> so<00:02:55.810> that<00:02:55.840> attack

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
best to use that attack so that attack

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.320 
best to use that attack so that attack
automatically<00:02:57.220> was<00:02:57.370> inserted<00:02:57.940> into<00:02:58.090> the

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
automatically was inserted into the

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.229 
automatically was inserted into the
chain<00:02:58.600> and<00:02:59.040> we<00:03:00.040> were<00:03:00.160> able<00:03:00.310> to<00:03:00.459> do<00:03:00.730> that<00:03:00.910> now

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
chain and we were able to do that now

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.240 
chain and we were able to do that now
you<00:03:01.300> can<00:03:01.600> pick<00:03:02.050> your<00:03:02.230> own<00:03:02.260> chain<00:03:02.650> attacks<00:03:03.010> if

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
you can pick your own chain attacks if

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.800 
you can pick your own chain attacks if
you'd<00:03:03.400> like<00:03:03.610> but<00:03:03.910> this<00:03:04.060> is<00:03:04.120> another<00:03:04.510> way<00:03:04.780> that

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
you'd like but this is another way that

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.650 
you'd like but this is another way that
the<00:03:05.050> game<00:03:05.790> makes<00:03:06.790> us<00:03:06.970> so<00:03:07.120> you<00:03:07.209> don't<00:03:07.420> need<00:03:07.510> the

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
the game makes us so you don't need the

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.140 
the game makes us so you don't need the
micromanagement

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
micromanagement

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.500 
micromanagement
so<00:03:10.110> if<00:03:10.980> you<00:03:11.220> don't<00:03:11.400> have<00:03:11.489> to<00:03:11.670> micromanage<00:03:11.849> them

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
so if you don't have to micromanage them

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.180 
so if you don't have to micromanage them
but<00:03:12.690> what<00:03:12.870> do<00:03:13.019> you<00:03:13.140> have<00:03:13.349> to<00:03:13.560> do<00:03:13.680> does<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:14.040> game

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
but what do you have to do does the game

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.350 
but what do you have to do does the game
just<00:03:14.430> play<00:03:14.790> for<00:03:15.510> you<00:03:15.720> it<00:03:16.440> doesn't<00:03:16.860> really<00:03:17.040> and

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
just play for you it doesn't really and

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.699 
just play for you it doesn't really and
the<00:03:18.360> important<00:03:18.810> decisions<00:03:19.260> that<00:03:19.409> you<00:03:19.500> make

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
the important decisions that you make

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.130 
the important decisions that you make
here<00:03:19.980> come<00:03:20.220> with<00:03:20.250> this<00:03:20.519> Optima<00:03:21.090> change<00:03:21.420> you

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
here come with this Optima change you

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.990 
here come with this Optima change you
can<00:03:22.260> see<00:03:22.440> we<00:03:22.560> just<00:03:22.769> changed<00:03:23.190> so<00:03:23.340> slowly<00:03:23.760> the

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
can see we just changed so slowly the

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.619 
can see we just changed so slowly the
catcher<00:03:24.269> and<00:03:24.810> hope<00:03:25.230> is<00:03:25.409> the<00:03:25.530> healer<00:03:25.829> now<00:03:26.730> we're

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 
catcher and hope is the healer now we're

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:29.600 
catcher and hope is the healer now we're
actually<00:03:28.019> gonna<00:03:28.260> change<00:03:28.349> right<00:03:29.159> back<00:03:29.370> again

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
actually gonna change right back again

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.930 
actually gonna change right back again
so<00:03:30.180> snow<00:03:31.049> is<00:03:31.200> attacker<00:03:31.560> and<00:03:31.890> hope<00:03:32.159> is<00:03:32.370> blaster

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
so snow is attacker and hope is blaster

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.910 
so snow is attacker and hope is blaster
now<00:03:33.299> we're<00:03:33.720> doing<00:03:33.840> this<00:03:34.140> in<00:03:34.379> order<00:03:34.530> to<00:03:34.799> do

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
now we're doing this in order to do

is<00:03:44.760> a<00:03:44.790> very<00:03:45.000> powerful<00:03:45.239> attack<00:03:45.840> and<00:03:46.049> if<00:03:46.140> you<00:03:46.319> did

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
is a very powerful attack and if you did

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.559 
is a very powerful attack and if you did
not<00:03:46.680> switch<00:03:47.010> to<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:47.459> defender<00:03:48.060> role<00:03:48.299> and

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
not switch to the defender role and

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.319 
not switch to the defender role and
defend<00:03:49.500> with<00:03:49.890> our<00:03:50.040> shield<00:03:50.400> up<00:03:50.579> as<00:03:50.760> quickly<00:03:51.060> as

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
possible we would have died so you can

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.039 
possible we would have died so you can
see<00:03:56.340> in<00:03:56.640> some<00:03:57.030> of<00:03:57.120> these<00:03:57.209> battles<00:03:57.480> it's<00:03:57.750> very
