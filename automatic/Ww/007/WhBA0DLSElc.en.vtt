00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.570
 in this exercise I want to get you 

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:15.879
 listen to a series of agreements in 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.980
 progression that I explain to you what it wants 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:20.020
 say quickly then meanwhile 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.080
 I show him with his left hand 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:26.619
 agreements that are present that are kings 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:30.609
 minor seventh soul seventh do seventh 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:34.210
 greater fa seventh major is set 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:36.970
 minor mil seventh and minor 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:41.469
 now I'll show you what on the keyboard 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:44.050
 I am precisely the progressions I repeat to you 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:45.879
 that you will have the sheet in front of you then 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.910
 I definitely recommend printing it and 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:53.160
 keep it there at your fingertips 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.160
 then I agree that it is the do ago 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:01:03.329
 I go on with soul you move me to one 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.329
 note therefore soul simi 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:13.119
 does the mii 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:16.770
 makes the Syrian rap soul 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:19.859
 and milan 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.039
 this is called progression , I put it 

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:25.860
 together with your left hand to get you 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:27.890
 also account for the sound that 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.890
 has 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.250
 I did this progression now 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.909
 slowly but naturally then then 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.530
 I also want to speed it up to show you 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.659
 exercise number two 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.759
 because there are notes that yes 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.890
 they call passing notes and you do it 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.000
 I show directly on the 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.799
 keyboard 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.039
 instead the concept is very simple 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:04.390
 instead of making two agreements let's say 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:04.390
 I don't know type buckets 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.450
 we try to move a little 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.280
 melody making so-called notes of 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.210
 passage that are extra notes 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.830
 simply that link that 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.830
 link the various agreements for example 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.920
 simply the passing notes are 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.830
 some notes that make the 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.460
 melody a little more oriented like you 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.460
 I said then 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:03:00.250
 while I give you an example of 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.250
 before the first exercise was 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.200
 so much more static for this 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.120
 video I invite you to download 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.950
 four free videos to learn a 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.400
 play the piano from scratch step 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.980
