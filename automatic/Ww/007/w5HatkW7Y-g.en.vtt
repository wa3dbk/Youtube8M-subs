all we've got the great granddaddy of

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.480 
all we've got the great granddaddy of
computers<00:00:22.050> here<00:00:22.230> this<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:22.500> an<00:00:22.619> abacus<00:00:23.010> can<00:00:23.400> you

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
computers here this is an abacus can you

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.279 
computers here this is an abacus can you
tell<00:00:23.699> us<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.910> little<00:00:24.119> bit<00:00:24.300> about<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.869> principle

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
tell us a little bit about the principle

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.109 
tell us a little bit about the principle
behind<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.740> well<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.369> course<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.730> don't<00:00:26.970> have

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
behind it well of course I don't have

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.970 
behind it well of course I don't have
any<00:00:27.269> practice<00:00:27.810> in<00:00:28.019> working<00:00:28.380> with<00:00:28.410> this<00:00:28.710> but

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
any practice in working with this but

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.950 
any practice in working with this but
this<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.400> Singleton's<00:00:30.000> one<00:00:30.390> two<00:00:30.570> three<00:00:30.750> four

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
this is Singleton's one two three four

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.319 
this is Singleton's one two three four
five<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.500> these<00:00:31.859> mean<00:00:32.099> fives<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.790> two<00:00:32.969> fives

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
five and these mean fives and two fives

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.090 
five and these mean fives and two fives
makes<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.840> ten<00:00:34.079> which<00:00:34.320> would<00:00:34.530> be<00:00:34.649> one<00:00:34.860> in<00:00:35.010> the

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
makes a ten which would be one in the

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.400 
makes a ten which would be one in the
next<00:00:35.309> row<00:00:35.489> so<00:00:35.730> basically<00:00:36.660> it's<00:00:36.809> very<00:00:36.870> close<00:00:37.260> to

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
next row so basically it's very close to

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.619 
next row so basically it's very close to
how<00:00:37.620> we<00:00:37.680> compute<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.520> how<00:00:38.670> we<00:00:38.730> calculate<00:00:39.450> in

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
how we compute and how we calculate in

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.139 
how we compute and how we calculate in
everyday<00:00:40.200> life<00:00:40.410> now<00:00:41.219> let's<00:00:41.370> get<00:00:41.489> back<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.850> you

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
everyday life now let's get back to you

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.250 
everyday life now let's get back to you
Lee<00:00:42.300> Arusha<00:00:42.600> sure<00:00:42.719> yeah<00:00:42.899> there<00:00:43.020> are<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.170> few

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
Lee Arusha sure yeah there are a few

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.979 
Lee Arusha sure yeah there are a few
similarities<00:00:43.860> between<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.760> two<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.149> you

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
similarities between the two of you you

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.540 
similarities between the two of you you
both<00:00:46.110> finish<00:00:46.440> university<00:00:46.950> quickly<00:00:47.280> won

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
both finish university quickly won

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.690 
both finish university quickly won
prizes<00:00:47.850> offer<00:00:48.450> jobs<00:00:48.899> at<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.170> very<00:00:49.350> young<00:00:49.559> age

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
prizes offer jobs at a very young age

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.340 
prizes offer jobs at a very young age
but<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:50.940> are<00:00:51.059> also<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:51.390> understand<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.930> big<00:00:52.079> fan

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
but you are also I understand a big fan

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.860 
but you are also I understand a big fan
of<00:00:52.379> literature<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.579> really<00:00:53.969> important<00:00:54.660> for

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
of literature is it really important for

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.319 
of literature is it really important for
mathematicians<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.829> have<00:00:56.010> other<00:00:56.399> hobbies

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
mathematicians to have other hobbies

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.110 
mathematicians to have other hobbies
I<00:00:57.360> think<00:00:58.170> mathematics<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.070> close<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.640> life<00:00:59.879> and

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
I think mathematics is close to life and

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.330 
I think mathematics is close to life and
it's<00:01:00.239> connected<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.780> many<00:01:01.079> things<00:01:01.440> but<00:01:02.160> of

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
it's connected to many things but of

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.250 
it's connected to many things but of
course<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.760> don't<00:01:02.969> want<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.359> just<00:01:03.600> study<00:01:03.899> one

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
course you don't want to just study one

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.859 
course you don't want to just study one
subject<00:01:04.619> like<00:01:05.070> mathematics<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.570> have<00:01:06.750> to

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
subject like mathematics and you have to

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.840 
subject like mathematics and you have to
concentrate<00:01:07.260> on<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.920> lot<00:01:08.100> but<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.610> don't

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
concentrate on it a lot but you don't

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.760 
concentrate on it a lot but you don't
want<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.119> do<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.420> one<00:01:09.689> thing<00:01:09.720> only<00:01:10.200> in<00:01:10.619> your

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
want to do this one thing only in your

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.460 
want to do this one thing only in your
life<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:11.970> think<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.659> mathematicians<00:01:13.290> I

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
life and so I think the mathematicians I

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.260 
life and so I think the mathematicians I
know<00:01:13.530> have<00:01:14.010> many<00:01:14.460> interests<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.150> many

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
know have many interests and many

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.590 
know have many interests and many
hobbies<00:01:15.659> many<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.530> them<00:01:16.680> are<00:01:16.830> good<00:01:16.979> in<00:01:17.100> music

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
hobbies many of them are good in music

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.789 
hobbies many of them are good in music
many<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.750> them<00:01:18.900> read<00:01:19.140> some<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.470> them<00:01:19.619> right

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
many of them read some of them right

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.830 
many of them read some of them right
that's<00:01:20.460> all<00:01:20.610> part<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:21.030> mathematics<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.720> it

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
that's all part of mathematics and it

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.800 
that's all part of mathematics and it
connects<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.229> mathematics<00:01:22.799> yeah<00:01:22.950> music<00:01:23.610> also

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
connects to mathematics yeah music also

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.390 
connects to mathematics yeah music also
of<00:01:24.810> course<00:01:25.020> having<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.409> lot<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.770> do<00:01:25.890> with<00:01:26.040> with

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
of course having a lot to do with with

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.969 
of course having a lot to do with with
mathematics<00:01:27.259> what<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.290> was<00:01:28.500> wondering<00:01:28.680> though

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
mathematics what I was wondering though

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.100 
mathematics what I was wondering though
is<00:01:29.130> whether<00:01:29.820> or<00:01:29.970> not<00:01:30.000> there<00:01:30.270> are<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.450> lot<00:01:31.079> of

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
is whether or not there are a lot of

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.749 
is whether or not there are a lot of
women<00:01:31.500> math<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:32.009> traditionally<00:01:32.610> considered

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
women math is traditionally considered

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.850 
women math is traditionally considered
kind<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.509> boy<00:01:33.659> science<00:01:34.229> are<00:01:34.409> there<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.619> lot<00:01:34.829> of

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
kind of a boy science are there a lot of

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.429 
kind of a boy science are there a lot of
women<00:01:35.070> in<00:01:35.310> your<00:01:35.460> department<00:01:35.939> or<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.630> Yuliya

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
women in your department or is Yuliya

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.859 
women in your department or is Yuliya
just<00:01:37.770> an<00:01:37.890> exception<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.610> think<00:01:39.420> we<00:01:39.540> have<00:01:39.659> two

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
just an exception I think we have two

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.899 
just an exception I think we have two
women<00:01:40.200> on<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.409> faculty<00:01:40.619> in<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:40.979> department

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
women on the faculty in the department

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.210 
women on the faculty in the department
but<00:01:42.060> we<00:01:42.180> have<00:01:42.270> 50%<00:01:42.899> women<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.560> students

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
but we have 50% women and the students

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.160 
but we have 50% women and the students
and<00:01:44.399> in<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.670> beginners<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.840> think<00:01:46.020> the

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
and in the beginners and I think the

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.230 
and in the beginners and I think the
stereotype<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:47.009> breaking<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:47.700> changing

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
stereotype is breaking and is changing

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.649 
stereotype is breaking and is changing
and<00:01:48.390> we<00:01:48.540> are<00:01:48.570> working<00:01:48.869> on<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:50.390> math<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.630> a

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
and we are working on that and math is a

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.109 
and we are working on that and math is a
women's<00:01:52.470> science<00:01:52.920> as<00:01:53.100> much<00:01:53.310> as<00:01:53.490> its<00:01:53.790> immense

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
women's science as much as its immense

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.149 
women's science as much as its immense
science<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.869> we<00:01:55.409> need<00:01:55.590> them<00:01:55.770> all

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
science and we need them all

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.800 
science and we need them all
I<00:01:56.189> mean<00:01:56.399> math<00:01:56.549> is<00:01:56.729> an<00:01:56.820> important<00:01:57.240> subject<00:01:57.420> and

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
I mean math is an important subject and

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.350 
I mean math is an important subject and
if<00:01:58.740> we<00:01:58.920> somehow<00:01:59.130> exclude<00:01:59.700> half<00:01:59.909> of<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.180> people

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
if we somehow exclude half of the people

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.959 
if we somehow exclude half of the people
from<00:02:00.719> doing<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.320> then<00:02:01.590> we<00:02:01.740> lose<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:01.950> lot<00:02:02.159> right

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
from doing it then we lose a lot right

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.660 
from doing it then we lose a lot right
now<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.869> is<00:02:04.110> though<00:02:04.500> pretty<00:02:05.219> hard<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.549> make

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
now it it is though pretty hard to make

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.730 
now it it is though pretty hard to make
math<00:02:05.909> riveting<00:02:06.689> for<00:02:06.960> students<00:02:07.380> in<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.619> way

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
math riveting for students in the way

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.070 
math riveting for students in the way
that<00:02:07.979> that<00:02:08.190> maybe<00:02:08.789> some<00:02:09.030> other<00:02:09.179> subjects<00:02:09.840> can

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
that that maybe some other subjects can

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.140 
that that maybe some other subjects can
be<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.259> lot<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:10.679> people<00:02:10.950> find<00:02:11.250> math<00:02:11.790> classes

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
be a lot of people find math classes

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.670 
be a lot of people find math classes
boring<00:02:12.900> or<00:02:13.080> just<00:02:13.290> difficult

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
boring or just difficult

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.429 
boring or just difficult
to<00:02:13.859> understand<00:02:14.400> how<00:02:15.030> can<00:02:15.090> we<00:02:15.719> make<00:02:16.140> math

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
to understand how can we make math

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:19.280 
to understand how can we make math
really<00:02:16.739> attractive<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.879> young<00:02:18.060> people<00:02:18.420> i<00:02:18.599> mean

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
really attractive to young people i mean

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.470 
really attractive to young people i mean
math<00:02:19.500> is<00:02:19.739> difficult<00:02:20.459> and<00:02:20.700> that's<00:02:20.819> one<00:02:21.150> of<00:02:21.180> the

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
math is difficult and that's one of the

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.869 
math is difficult and that's one of the
truths<00:02:21.959> that<00:02:22.200> we<00:02:22.379> just<00:02:22.620> have<00:02:22.799> to<00:02:23.010> confront<00:02:23.609> on

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
truths that we just have to confront on

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.789 
truths that we just have to confront on
the<00:02:24.000> other<00:02:24.120> hand<00:02:24.359> maths<00:02:24.719> is<00:02:24.989> many<00:02:25.590> different

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
the other hand maths is many different

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.849 
the other hand maths is many different
things<00:02:26.099> and<00:02:27.060> so<00:02:27.239> if<00:02:27.390> we<00:02:27.569> explain<00:02:28.019> math<00:02:28.379> when<00:02:28.739> we

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:28.859 
things and so if we explain math when we

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:30.740 
things and so if we explain math when we
present<00:02:29.099> math<00:02:29.549> we<00:02:29.819> have<00:02:29.849> to<00:02:30.090> show<00:02:30.299> that<00:02:30.329> and

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
present math we have to show that and

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.069 
present math we have to show that and
math<00:02:31.409> is<00:02:31.620> not<00:02:31.650> only<00:02:32.310> calculating<00:02:33.120> with<00:02:33.780> larger

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
math is not only calculating with larger

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.170 
math is not only calculating with larger
and<00:02:34.200> larger<00:02:34.290> numbers<00:02:34.590> but<00:02:35.250> math<00:02:35.939> is<00:02:36.120> the

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
and larger numbers but math is the

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.000 
and larger numbers but math is the
science<00:02:36.629> of<00:02:36.750> structures<00:02:37.260> its<00:02:37.469> designs<00:02:37.829> of

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
science of structures its designs of

art<00:02:40.620> all<00:02:40.950> of<00:02:40.980> this<00:02:41.250> is<00:02:41.400> math<00:02:41.639> and<00:02:41.909> when<00:02:42.030> we

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
art all of this is math and when we

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.449 
art all of this is math and when we
teach<00:02:42.420> math<00:02:42.719> we<00:02:43.019> have<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.469> teach<00:02:44.159> these

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
teach math we have to teach these

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.009 
teach math we have to teach these
connections<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:45.269> we<00:02:45.389> have<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:45.629> show<00:02:45.840> these

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
connections and we have to show these
