00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.850 
so we'll just keep plugging away we
change<00:02:55.800> the<00:02:56.190> front<00:02:57.140> calipers<00:02:58.140> at<00:02:58.440> service

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
change the front calipers at service

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.860 
change the front calipers at service
first<00:02:59.040> service<00:02:59.370> and<00:02:59.580> put<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.180> pads<00:03:00.480> back<00:03:00.690> in

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
first service and put the pads back in

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.590 
first service and put the pads back in

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
there's still a little bit strange run

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.210 
there's still a little bit strange run
it<00:03:03.690> through<00:03:03.810> kalamunda<00:03:04.140> so<00:03:04.530> then<00:03:04.740> we<00:03:04.860> are<00:03:05.010> put

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
it through kalamunda so then we are put

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.590 
it through kalamunda so then we are put
some<00:03:05.370> different<00:03:05.640> pegs<00:03:05.820> in<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:05.970> rear<00:03:06.180> it<00:03:06.390> seems

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
some different pegs in the rear it seems

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.240 
some different pegs in the rear it seems
to<00:03:06.750> be<00:03:06.780> a<00:03:06.900> bit<00:03:06.930> better<00:03:07.140> here<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.890> car<00:03:08.040> is<00:03:08.130> going

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
to be a bit better here the car is going

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.190 
to be a bit better here the car is going
well<00:03:08.460> partly<00:03:08.760> alternator<00:03:09.150> issue<00:03:09.360> which<00:03:10.080> we

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
well partly alternator issue which we

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.410 
well partly alternator issue which we
managed<00:03:10.470> during<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.770> day<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:11.330> didn't<00:03:12.330> have

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
managed during the day and didn't have

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.630 
managed during the day and didn't have
any<00:03:12.600> impact<00:03:12.780> on<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.050> performance<00:03:13.140> so<00:03:13.890> yeah

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
any impact on the performance so yeah

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.240 
any impact on the performance so yeah
we're<00:03:14.820> quite<00:03:14.970> confident<00:03:15.330> we<00:03:15.510> can<00:03:16.250> hopefully

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
we're quite confident we can hopefully

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.210 
we're quite confident we can hopefully
keep<00:03:17.550> them<00:03:17.640> at<00:03:17.790> bay<00:03:17.820> and<00:03:18.950> get<00:03:19.950> through<00:03:20.070> to

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
keep them at bay and get through to

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:46.890 
keep them at bay and get through to
somebody<00:03:20.490> this<00:03:20.610> time

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.959
