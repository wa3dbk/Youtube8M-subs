00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:18.999
 but there are exceptions 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.050
 Are you getting ready to leave? 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.480
 when suddenly this is what appears in the room 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.810
 wearing a suit he chose for himself 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.789
 the problem 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.039
 that caused a long sleeve blouse by luck did not explode 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.150
 lack of evidence 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.870
 What to do at the moment? 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.720
 It is important that parents

 I know this area by guiding it in the most appropriate way 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.510
 before the age of six 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.860
 children do not have dem they should not use 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.710

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.320
 warned 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.750

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.180
 speaking the trio the autonomy of the child who also got along and the 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.420
 sometimes we think the baby does not have told those we're doing 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.290
 but if you're going to think about whether you're already open to the idea 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.290
 if I put on these clothes because it's hot today 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.100
 because today is the cril the child will already have a greater possibility of 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.100
 make your own choices 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.420
 asked if the child passes a laundry in advance 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.530

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.750
 discuss with him the possibility of making another type of combination 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.570
