lengthening<00:00:21.660> lash<00:00:22.939> III<00:00:23.939> do<00:00:24.240> have<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.600> small

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
lengthening lash III do have a small

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.589 
lengthening lash III do have a small
lash<00:00:25.260> so<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:26.430> know<00:00:26.580> I<00:00:26.609> don't<00:00:26.910> get<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.090> whole<00:00:27.359> lot

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
lash so you know I don't get a whole lot

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.990 
lash so you know I don't get a whole lot
of<00:00:27.630> lengthening<00:00:28.080> but<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:28.800> does<00:00:29.010> linking<00:00:29.609> my

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
of lengthening but it does linking my

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.690 
of lengthening but it does linking my
lash<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:31.520> I<00:00:32.520> like<00:00:33.210> that<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.719> bristles<00:00:33.960> are

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
lash and I like that the bristles are

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.389 
lash and I like that the bristles are
small<00:00:35.700> like<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.890> means<00:00:38.190> that

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
small like that and that means that

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.850 
small like that and that means that
they're<00:00:38.640> able<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:39.270> reach<00:00:39.540> in<00:00:39.840> areas<00:00:40.829> that

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
they're able to reach in areas that

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.290 
they're able to reach in areas that
easily<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.210> also<00:00:43.170> what<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.280> like<00:00:44.730> about<00:00:44.910> this

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
easily and also what I like about this

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.610 
easily and also what I like about this
is<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.649> has<00:00:46.860> like<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.190> little<00:00:47.940> curve<00:00:48.620> scoop

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
is that it has like a little curve scoop

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.450 
is that it has like a little curve scoop
of<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:51.140> brush<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.440> that's<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:53.190> know<00:00:53.309> that's

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
of a brush and that's you know that's

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.060 
of a brush and that's you know that's
really<00:00:53.789> good<00:00:53.969> because<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.420> helps<00:00:54.570> with

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
really good because it helps with

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.400 
really good because it helps with
curling<00:00:56.070> up<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.550> lash<00:00:56.780> but<00:00:57.780> what<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.020> am<00:00:58.379> a

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
curling up the lash but what I am a

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.619 
curling up the lash but what I am a
little<00:00:58.680> concerned<00:00:59.190> about<00:00:59.309> with<00:00:59.760> this<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.239> that

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
little concerned about with this is that

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.170 
little concerned about with this is that
when<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:01.020> go<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.230> put<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.649> away<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:02.309> does<00:01:02.940> have

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
when you go to put it away it does have

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.420 
when you go to put it away it does have
a<00:01:03.210> very<00:01:03.570> flexible<00:01:06.020> brush<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.220> when

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
a very flexible brush to it and so when

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.340 
a very flexible brush to it and so when
that<00:01:08.549> happens<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.330> tend<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.170> get<00:01:10.290> a

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
that happens that you tend to get a

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.750 
that happens that you tend to get a
little<00:01:10.530> messy<00:01:10.979> around<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.990> rim<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.760> top

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
little messy around the rim of the top

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.359 
little messy around the rim of the top
the<00:01:15.119> container<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:16.350> I'm<00:01:16.710> going<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.070> put<00:01:17.220> this

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
the container so I'm going to put this

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.060 
the container so I'm going to put this
lash<00:01:17.640> on<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.330> can<00:01:18.570> just<00:01:18.600> kind<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.140> see<00:01:19.350> what

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
lash on so you can just kind of see what

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.340 
lash on so you can just kind of see what
it<00:01:20.280> how<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.880> works<00:01:21.119> this<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:21.960> my<00:01:22.170> lash<00:01:22.439> now<00:01:22.770> I

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
it how it works this is my lash now I

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.920 
it how it works this is my lash now I
don't<00:01:25.350> have<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.740> very<00:01:25.979> long<00:01:26.340> lash<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:27.210> have<00:01:27.900> a

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
don't have a very long lash I have a

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.980 
don't have a very long lash I have a
very<00:01:28.290> thin<00:01:29.780> lash<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:32.329> now<00:01:33.329> I'm<00:01:33.540> going<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.810> just

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
very thin lash and now I'm going to just

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.930 
very thin lash and now I'm going to just
put<00:01:34.700> Dorthe<00:01:35.700> applying<00:01:36.150> it

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.490 

and<00:01:39.940> so<00:01:40.060> you<00:01:40.180> can<00:01:40.360> see<00:01:43.020> what<00:01:44.020> you<00:01:44.170> get<00:01:44.290> with

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
and so you can see what you get with

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.760 
and so you can see what you get with
this<00:01:44.940> now<00:01:45.940> not<00:01:46.210> being<00:01:46.540> being<00:01:47.020> that<00:01:47.290> this<00:01:47.500> is<00:01:47.560> a

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
this now not being being that this is a

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.020 
this now not being being that this is a
flexible<00:01:48.870> brush<00:01:49.870> it's<00:01:50.800> a<00:01:51.070> little<00:01:51.460> difficult

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
flexible brush it's a little difficult

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.200 
flexible brush it's a little difficult
to<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:53.500> know<00:01:53.650> apply<00:01:53.980> it<00:01:54.130> because<00:01:54.700> it<00:01:54.940> keeps

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
to you know apply it because it keeps

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.380 
to you know apply it because it keeps
you<00:01:55.570> know<00:01:55.860> bending<00:01:56.860> and<00:01:57.160> moving<00:01:57.670> around<00:01:57.790> and

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
you know bending and moving around and

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.660 
you know bending and moving around and
so<00:01:58.420> that<00:01:59.290> that<00:01:59.560> makes<00:01:59.800> it<00:02:00.100> a<00:02:00.220> little<00:02:00.400> bit

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
so that that makes it a little bit

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:09.719 
so that that makes it a little bit
difficult<00:02:01.000> to<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:02.530> know<00:02:02.650> apply<00:02:08.399> but<00:02:09.399> it<00:02:09.520> does

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
difficult to you know apply but it does

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:21.370 
difficult to you know apply but it does
give<00:02:10.030> you<00:02:10.180> a<00:02:10.210> natural<00:02:10.480> look

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.420 

it<00:02:21.920> doesn't<00:02:22.370> have<00:02:22.520> a<00:02:22.550> lot<00:02:22.760> of<00:02:22.790> volume<00:02:24.160> and<00:02:25.160> see

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
it doesn't have a lot of volume and see

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.520 
it doesn't have a lot of volume and see
that<00:02:26.020> and<00:02:27.020> this<00:02:27.200> is<00:02:27.410> what<00:02:27.650> my<00:02:28.610> before<00:02:29.060> and<00:02:29.530> this

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
that and this is what my before and this

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:41.920 
that and this is what my before and this
is<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.740> after<00:02:35.110> lie<00:02:36.110> a<00:02:36.140> little<00:02:36.350> bit<00:02:36.560> more

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.950 

okay

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:51.770 

so<00:02:45.960> this<00:02:48.650> mascara<00:02:49.650> it<00:02:49.980> is<00:02:50.130> a<00:02:50.370> you<00:02:51.030> know<00:02:51.150> mascara
