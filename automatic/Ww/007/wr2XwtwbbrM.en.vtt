00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.170 
section on that tip what you might find
in<00:01:16.170> creating<00:01:16.740> your<00:01:16.860> Dee<00:01:17.130> loop<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:18.060> you're

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
in creating your Dee loop is that you're

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.420 
in creating your Dee loop is that you're
pulling<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.750> floating<00:01:19.290> section<00:01:19.770> up<00:01:19.979> off<00:01:20.189> the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
pulling that floating section up off the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.179 
pulling that floating section up off the
surface<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.030> water<00:01:21.330> all<00:01:22.200> that's<00:01:22.619> doing<00:01:22.890> is

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
surface of the water all that's doing is

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.280 
surface of the water all that's doing is
adding<00:01:23.400> additional<00:01:23.939> grains<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.900> your<00:01:25.020> head

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
adding additional grains to your head

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.870 
adding additional grains to your head
and<00:01:25.530> it's<00:01:25.920> going<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.159> make<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.490> more<00:01:26.670> difficult

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
and it's going to make it more difficult

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.870 
and it's going to make it more difficult
to<00:01:27.330> cast<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.829> nice<00:01:29.009> thing<00:01:29.369> about<00:01:29.400> an

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
to cast so the nice thing about an

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.749 
to cast so the nice thing about an
intermediate<00:01:30.630> section<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:31.979> stays<00:01:32.310> on

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
intermediate section is that it stays on

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.590 
intermediate section is that it stays on
top<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.630> surface<00:01:33.869> or<00:01:34.290> just<00:01:34.320> subsurface
