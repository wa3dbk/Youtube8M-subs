 hi friends from youtube I am full games 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.640
 and this in my first tutorial on how 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.080
 download the incredible hulk game 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.080
 portable in a link 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.789
 ok let's start first download the 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.890
 winrar file that weighs about 3 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.170
 megabytes 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.470
 ok once downloaded they click 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.330
 right and extract here once extracted 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.400
 will leave us a folder with the same 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.099
 name we open it with double click and there 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.559
 inside will be the game 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.559
 I will execute to see whether they will walk 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.570

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.590

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.280

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.750
