00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
woman

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.700 
woman
they<00:01:30.119> lose<00:01:30.420> their<00:01:30.570> erection<00:01:31.020> within<00:01:31.290> 3<00:01:31.439> or<00:01:31.500> 4

they lose their erection within 3 or 4

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.700 
they lose their erection within 3 or 4
minutes<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.159> they<00:01:32.250> can't<00:01:32.490> get<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.670> back<00:01:32.820> up<00:01:32.970> so

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
minutes and they can't get it back up so

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.840 
minutes and they can't get it back up so
that's<00:01:34.710> one<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.040> problems<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.670> can

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
that's one of the problems and that can

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.550 
that's one of the problems and that can
lower<00:01:36.030> confidence<00:01:36.720> all<00:01:36.900> around<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.470> in

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
lower confidence all around and in

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.620 
lower confidence all around and in
general<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.579> point<00:01:38.939> addiction<00:01:39.329> can<00:01:39.479> make

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
general it the point addiction can make

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.539 
general it the point addiction can make
men<00:01:39.990> less<00:01:40.259> comfortable<00:01:40.680> or<00:01:40.860> less<00:01:41.009> confident

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
men less comfortable or less confident

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.310 
men less comfortable or less confident
with<00:01:41.700> real<00:01:41.939> women<00:01:42.240> outside<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.200> their

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
with real women outside of their

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.800 
with real women outside of their
computer<00:01:43.770> screen<00:01:44.070> it's<00:01:45.030> not<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.479> fact<00:01:45.689> that

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
computer screen it's not the fact that

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.100 
computer screen it's not the fact that
they've<00:01:45.990> abstained<00:01:46.530> from<00:01:48.110> ejaculation

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
they've abstained from ejaculation

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.170 
they've abstained from ejaculation
that's<00:01:49.380> caused<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:50.250> but<00:01:50.549> rather<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.970> fact

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
that's caused this but rather the fact

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.969 
that's caused this but rather the fact
that<00:01:51.299> they've<00:01:51.509> broken<00:01:51.869> their<00:01:52.140> pornography

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
that they've broken their pornography

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.219 
that they've broken their pornography
addiction<00:01:53.430> so<00:01:54.030> it's<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.750> little<00:01:54.960> bit<00:01:55.079> different

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
addiction so it's a little bit different

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.359 
addiction so it's a little bit different
thing<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.470> I'm<00:01:55.649> not<00:01:55.799> saying<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.130> every

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
thing and I'm not saying that every

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.889 
thing and I'm not saying that every
person<00:01:56.759> who<00:01:56.850> watches<00:01:57.060> porn<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.570> going<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.780> get

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
person who watches porn is going to get

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.990 
person who watches porn is going to get
addicted<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.409> majority<00:01:58.920> won't<00:01:59.159> but<00:01:59.850> yeah

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
we measure this the fluctuations like

slightly<00:03:05.440> more<00:03:05.800> but<00:03:05.980> it's<00:03:06.070> overtime<00:03:06.310> because

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
slightly more but it's overtime because

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.340 
slightly more but it's overtime because
there<00:03:07.120> tends<00:03:07.300> to<00:03:07.360> be<00:03:07.450> a<00:03:07.570> fall<00:03:07.900> and<00:03:08.230> then<00:03:08.320> a

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
there tends to be a fall and then a

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.220 
there tends to be a fall and then a
spike<00:03:08.920> afterwards<00:03:09.520> but<00:03:10.360> in<00:03:10.510> all<00:03:10.600> honesty<00:03:11.080> even

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
spike afterwards but in all honesty even

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.080 
spike afterwards but in all honesty even
that<00:03:11.500> isn't<00:03:11.680> worth<00:03:11.980> chasing<00:03:12.340> it's<00:03:12.670> not<00:03:12.850> going

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
that isn't worth chasing it's not going

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.000 
that isn't worth chasing it's not going
to<00:03:13.180> give<00:03:13.300> you<00:03:13.390> the<00:03:13.510> benefits<00:03:13.990> that<00:03:14.410> you<00:03:14.770> think

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
to give you the benefits that you think

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.010 
to give you the benefits that you think
it's<00:03:15.160> going<00:03:15.459> to<00:03:15.540> because<00:03:16.540> again<00:03:16.570> those

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
it's going to because again those

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.080 
it's going to because again those
transient<00:03:17.650> fluctuations<00:03:18.340> really<00:03:18.850> don't

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
transient fluctuations really don't

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.400 
transient fluctuations really don't
matter<00:03:19.270> there<00:03:19.570> might<00:03:19.690> be<00:03:19.720> something<00:03:20.110> I<00:03:20.200> cover

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
matter there might be something I cover

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.050 
matter there might be something I cover
later<00:03:20.680> in<00:03:20.770> the<00:03:20.890> future<00:03:21.190> get<00:03:21.370> a<00:03:21.430> breakdown<00:03:21.880> the

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
later in the future get a breakdown the

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.670 
later in the future get a breakdown the
sort<00:03:22.270> of<00:03:22.360> things<00:03:22.540> again<00:03:22.900> that<00:03:22.930> do<00:03:23.320> boost

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
sort of things again that do boost

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.380 
sort of things again that do boost
testosterone<00:03:23.920> production<00:03:24.550> normally<00:03:25.180> and

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
testosterone production normally and

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.180 
testosterone production normally and
it's<00:03:26.020> interesting<00:03:26.680> from<00:03:26.890> an<00:03:27.040> academic

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
it's interesting from an academic

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.250 
it's interesting from an academic
perspective<00:03:27.670> but<00:03:28.150> it's<00:03:28.300> worthless<00:03:28.780> from<00:03:29.170> a

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
perspective but it's worthless from a

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.930 
perspective but it's worthless from a
perspective<00:03:29.500> of<00:03:29.830> gaining<00:03:30.160> muscle<00:03:30.489> mass<00:03:30.640> and

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
perspective of gaining muscle mass and

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.080 
perspective of gaining muscle mass and
so<00:03:31.540> this<00:03:31.720> whole<00:03:31.959> concept<00:03:32.320> of<00:03:33.090> masturbation

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
so this whole concept of masturbation

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.090 
so this whole concept of masturbation
interfering<00:03:34.930> with<00:03:35.380> your<00:03:35.530> Dane's<00:03:35.830> or

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
interfering with your Dane's or

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.560 
interfering with your Dane's or
ejaculation<00:03:36.340> or<00:03:36.880> sex<00:03:37.120> or<00:03:37.209> you<00:03:37.300> need<00:03:37.450> that

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
ejaculation or sex or you need that

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:38.910 
ejaculation or sex or you need that
interfering<00:03:37.989> with<00:03:38.140> your<00:03:38.260> muscle<00:03:38.560> gains<00:03:38.739> is

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
interfering with your muscle gains is

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.490 
interfering with your muscle gains is
complete<00:03:39.340> nonsense<00:03:39.959> via<00:03:40.959> all<00:03:41.230> of<00:03:41.380> the

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
complete nonsense via all of the
