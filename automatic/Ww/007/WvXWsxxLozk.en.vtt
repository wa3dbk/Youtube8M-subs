Karma we choose when we choose to be

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.240 
Karma we choose when we choose to be
human<00:00:51.079> because<00:00:52.079> we<00:00:52.230> don't<00:00:52.500> always<00:00:52.649> choose<00:00:52.860> to

be human but when we do it's primarily

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.349 
be human but when we do it's primarily
for<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:58.170> few<00:00:58.469> different<00:00:58.829> reasons<00:00:59.010> but<00:00:59.730> the

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
for a few different reasons but the

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.579 
for a few different reasons but the
largest<00:01:01.140> reason<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:02.300> emotionality<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:04.170> human

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
largest reason is emotionality the human

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.350 
largest reason is emotionality the human

form the human planet Earth school gives

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.640 
form the human planet Earth school gives
us<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.780> rich<00:01:10.290> experience<00:01:11.210> in<00:01:12.380> emotionality<00:01:13.380> and

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
us a rich experience in emotionality and

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.420 
us a rich experience in emotionality and
in<00:01:13.890> fact<00:01:14.189> emotionality<00:01:15.180> contains<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:16.430> second

and<00:02:43.260> reviewing<00:02:44.260> our<00:02:44.530> lives<00:02:45.269> when<00:02:46.269> we<00:02:46.510> see<00:02:46.870> this

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
and reviewing our lives when we see this

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.770 
and reviewing our lives when we see this
kind<00:02:47.560> of<00:02:47.739> controlling<00:02:48.250> behavior<00:02:48.549> we<00:02:49.239> don't

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
kind of controlling behavior we don't

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.009 
kind of controlling behavior we don't
feel<00:02:50.260> good<00:02:50.290> about<00:02:50.890> it<00:02:51.250> we<00:02:51.910> feel<00:02:52.360> like<00:02:52.599> we<00:02:52.780> can

feel good about it we feel like we can
do<00:02:53.230> better<00:02:53.530> and<00:02:53.880> so<00:02:54.880> it<00:02:55.060> comes<00:02:55.269> to<00:02:55.569> like

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
do better and so it comes to like

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.130 
do better and so it comes to like
rigidity<00:02:56.349> versus<00:02:57.150> flexibility<00:02:58.150> negative

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
positive values to it but that's one way

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.500
