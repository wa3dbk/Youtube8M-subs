plugged in so there's no power to it but

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.440 
plugged in so there's no power to it but
I<00:02:50.409> basically<00:02:50.980> just<00:02:51.099> hacked<00:02:51.489> off<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:51.970> plug<00:02:52.209> and

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
I basically just hacked off the plug and

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.199 
I basically just hacked off the plug and
of<00:02:52.599> it<00:02:52.720> strip<00:02:53.079> the<00:02:53.200> wires<00:02:53.379> back<00:02:53.739> and<00:02:54.209> screwed

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
of it strip the wires back and screwed

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.210 
of it strip the wires back and screwed
them<00:02:55.390> into<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.750> terminals<00:02:56.230> on<00:02:56.530> that<00:02:56.890> little

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
them into the terminals on that little

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.390 
them into the terminals on that little
inlet<00:02:57.760> jack<00:02:58.060> so<00:02:58.690> what<00:02:59.049> that<00:02:59.200> does<00:02:59.500> for<00:02:59.560> me<00:03:00.099> is

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
inlet jack so what that does for me is

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.000 
inlet jack so what that does for me is
is<00:03:01.060> it<00:03:01.269> provides<00:03:01.659> me<00:03:01.959> with<00:03:01.989> basically<00:03:02.680> this

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
is it provides me with basically this

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.300 
is it provides me with basically this
auxilary<00:03:04.260> household<00:03:05.260> power<00:03:05.500> when<00:03:06.010> I'm<00:03:06.129> at<00:03:06.280> my

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310

they're giving me free electrical

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:13.920 
they're giving me free electrical
hook-up<00:03:11.409> so<00:03:12.040> I<00:03:12.099> can<00:03:12.370> plug<00:03:12.549> into<00:03:12.819> that<00:03:13.000> 110<00:03:13.659> at

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
hook-up so I can plug into that 110 at

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.680 
hook-up so I can plug into that 110 at
the<00:03:14.049> hookups<00:03:14.440> and<00:03:14.739> run<00:03:15.459> an<00:03:15.549> extension<00:03:15.909> cord<00:03:16.389> to

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
the hookups and run an extension cord to

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.080 
the hookups and run an extension cord to
that<00:03:17.079> inlet<00:03:17.440> on<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:17.709> outside<00:03:18.190> that<00:03:18.879> way<00:03:19.060> I

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
that inlet on the outside that way I

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.940 
that inlet on the outside that way I
don't<00:03:19.269> have<00:03:19.450> to<00:03:19.629> run<00:03:19.959> like<00:03:20.200> a<00:03:20.230> cord<00:03:20.620> through<00:03:20.889> a

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
don't have to run like a cord through a

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.949 
don't have to run like a cord through a
window<00:03:21.340> or<00:03:21.370> a<00:03:21.549> crack<00:03:21.879> in<00:03:22.060> the<00:03:22.180> door<00:03:22.329> which

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
window or a crack in the door which

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.289 
window or a crack in the door which
would<00:03:23.139> be<00:03:23.290> kind<00:03:23.500> of<00:03:23.590> lame<00:03:24.090> especially<00:03:25.090> if<00:03:25.180> it

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
would be kind of lame especially if it

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:26.970 
would be kind of lame especially if it
ends<00:03:25.569> up<00:03:25.599> raining<00:03:25.930> and<00:03:26.200> that<00:03:26.349> and<00:03:26.590> that<00:03:26.769> is

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
ends up raining and that and that is

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.099 
ends up raining and that and that is
sealed<00:03:27.370> watertight<00:03:27.819> when<00:03:28.299> you<00:03:28.389> plug<00:03:28.599> into<00:03:28.840> it

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.109 
sealed watertight when you plug into it

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:30.809 
sealed watertight when you plug into it
on<00:03:29.319> the<00:03:29.440> end<00:03:29.560> of<00:03:29.620> my<00:03:29.680> extension<00:03:30.250> cord<00:03:30.519> it<00:03:30.670> has<00:03:30.790> a

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
on the end of my extension cord it has a

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.720 
on the end of my extension cord it has a
round<00:03:31.209> plug<00:03:31.720> that<00:03:32.379> fits<00:03:32.620> really<00:03:32.889> snugly<00:03:33.069> in

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
round plug that fits really snugly in

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.330 
round plug that fits really snugly in
there<00:03:33.909> so<00:03:34.419> no<00:03:34.840> water<00:03:35.079> can<00:03:35.260> get<00:03:35.470> in<00:03:35.620> so<00:03:36.220> that's

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
there so no water can get in so that's

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.640 
there so no water can get in so that's
cool<00:03:36.669> and<00:03:36.970> basically<00:03:37.389> what<00:03:38.019> that<00:03:38.049> will<00:03:38.440> allow

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
cool and basically what that will allow

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.240 
cool and basically what that will allow
me<00:03:38.829> to<00:03:38.859> do<00:03:39.160> is<00:03:39.599> I'm<00:03:40.599> kind<00:03:40.840> of<00:03:41.049> projecting<00:03:41.739> to<00:03:42.069> be

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
me to do is I'm kind of projecting to be

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.089 
me to do is I'm kind of projecting to be
in<00:03:42.579> areas<00:03:43.239> that<00:03:43.269> aren't<00:03:43.840> is<00:03:44.230> you<00:03:44.620> know<00:03:44.739> sunny

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:08.169 
batteries and be without my laptop and

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:11.729 
batteries and be without my laptop and
fridge<00:04:09.129> and<00:04:09.840> you<00:04:10.840> know<00:04:10.930> all<00:04:11.139> the<00:04:11.290> stuff<00:04:11.530> that<00:04:11.560> I

use<00:04:12.010> my<00:04:12.220> house<00:04:12.430> batteries<00:04:12.699> for<00:04:13.120> so<00:04:13.750> the<00:04:14.109> idea

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
use my house batteries for so the idea

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.819 
use my house batteries for so the idea
behind<00:04:14.680> that<00:04:14.949> is<00:04:15.310> is<00:04:15.819> to<00:04:16.060> basically<00:04:16.530> not<00:04:17.530> have

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
behind that is is to basically not have

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.339 
behind that is is to basically not have
to<00:04:17.979> rely<00:04:18.310> on<00:04:18.340> the<00:04:18.669> Sun<00:04:18.880> I<00:04:19.180> don't<00:04:19.870> know<00:04:20.049> what<00:04:20.229> the

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:20.349 
to rely on the Sun I don't know what the

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:22.260 
to rely on the Sun I don't know what the
weather<00:04:20.530> patterns<00:04:21.010> are<00:04:21.130> like<00:04:21.519> like<00:04:21.820> out<00:04:22.030> there

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
house batteries to have plenty of power

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.740
