00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:06.600
 lately he's not having a good time 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.730
 you are suffering for people who are 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.230
 away from you by your own family which 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.469
 is their situation at this moment 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.299
 good lately 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.630
 suffering, I would say that I should not 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.420
 the last 13 years 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.760
 since leaving Venezuela for the 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.769
 reasons that many already know the 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.349
 situation and true that is living 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:32.070
 in the country what dramatically complicated 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.630
 that is surviving now in my country to 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.489
 Like so many other Venezuelans as 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.710
 he has not decided to leave and stay outside 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.559
 make a new life to be family in a 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.290
 healthiest environment more welcoming more 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.200
 sure in this minute chile offers me 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.149
 that my husband is Chilean and good in that 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.410
 sense one clear suffers at a distance 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:55.079
 every day permanent sales the 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.969
 risk to the family suffers the 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.829
 family that stays in a country where no 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.390
 is a green rival is not a risk of 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.980
 life is a risk of being kidnapped or 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.570
 we are talking a risk of not being able to 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.129
 undertake what they like about not being able to 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.380
 work on what they like 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:12.000
 risk of any life risk because 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:14.299
 are killing 22 thousand Venezuelans 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.299
 year 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.729
 murdered and that's why death will be nothing 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.829
 murdered if they are killed by the 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.810
 delinquency basic crime 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:29.159
 50 delinquency cell and multiply 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:32.130
 I kill murder by any 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.950
 minor reason for reverte the pair of 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.500
 shoes because they wanted the car and I do not know 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.340
 you gave it by robert the clock the cell phone 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.959
 everything material lately has fed up 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.729
 importance then any reason or 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:46.920
 any excuse is enough to 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.209
 shoot you because also according to the 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.459
 figures that I had reading these days 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:55.349
 there are some 16 16 million weapons 

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:58.229
 illegal in Venezuela without any kind of 

00:01:55.349 --> 00:02:00.000
 with 16 million acts as they claim 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.250
 that people are not killing themselves easily 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.590
 if there are millions of weapons that theoretically 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.569
 they enter the country and not only go to the hands of 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.399
 the criminals but they are also in 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:11.790
 hands of this one 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:17.319
 parallel these Bolivarian circles 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:19.269
 protectors of the paramilitaries in the 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.099
 process that are all armed until the 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.810
 lyrics then giannini when the motorbike 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.950
 family of those who appear before 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.709
 how many points with how many people 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.890
 make up that group and who are 12 guys 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:33.790
 40 cousins ​​and my close circles mom 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.730
 dad brothers and it's impossible for them and 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.049
 what does that depend on for example from 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.970
 one depends what decisions are 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:43.000
 personal and for suddenly for one 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:46.230
 who is younger is much easier to leave 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.579
 of getting to live a clear life 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.140
 it depends on your personality of the desire 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:52.900
 that he has to make of your ability to 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:56.769
 adaptation maybe but for one to 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.299
 a family a larger family nucleus is 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.360
 very complicated out of their networks 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.360
 support for 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.140
 let's say leave your brothers of the 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:07.299
 Grandpa's cousins ​​of this is what 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.829
 finally makes life for a family 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.360
 like mine where the main thing is 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:12.579
 family everything else is in a second 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.739
 flat but we were taught that what 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.870
 more important is the family the truth 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.040
 I do the main thing but for example the 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.349
 material things do not have any degree 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.290
 of importance said eduardo sources 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:25.359
 there in the note is that of the car we can 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.980
 revise your words again look at this 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:28.980
 life 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:41.060
 and I only have a problem with her 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.220
 but that is not life professionals 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.900
 what did the car that poor 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.580
 subscribed some years ago that already 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.580
 account but the rest 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:56.430
 what is that about the car and also attends 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.430
 auto because I have 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.240
 if not he refers to an episode 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:11.170
 and I started in true lies that you 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.800
 it was basically an episode of 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:22.910
 revenge 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:25.900
 come because I had a good day 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.900
 a lot of damage 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:37.730
 I was not another age guy either 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:45.590
 the staff was deep the bottom line is 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:48.770
 countless in televisa I got revenge 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:53.120
 first I planned it and I said in a year 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:55.310
 more when already in a year more when already 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.610
 we are far away and do not think that 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.610
 I was 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.450
 I'm going to hurt him in something that he 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.260
 stave 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:10.850
 according to the car it was one thing that mom 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:15.280
 I will not hurt him in what 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.280
 personal or his family I'm not so crazy 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:22.080
 then if you go through a bencinera 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:24.720
 buy 2 liters of this liquid 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.550
 battery since they fear painting the 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.220
 acid battery that was recommended to me by 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.080
 firefighter kindly bought me two liters 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:34.080
 and I left at 12 at night to his house 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.540
 and empty the crimes of action to the 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:41.000
 painting with the guarantee that it was going 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:41.000
 to install twice 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:55.310
 the car I do not think I ever saw it in 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:55.310
 Chile 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:12.200
 I do not regret anything but life 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.200
 that relationship I regret 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:22.469
 you can also see from this kind of 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.999
 situations of a woman's attitudes is 

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:25.710
 a man is capable of causing harm 

00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:27.090
 something material to take revenge for something 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.689
 sentimental encounter that in certain 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:31.650
 way is great what you did 

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:33.810
 we basically discover what many 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:36.060
 Sometimes the person has a disappointment 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.650
 loving and feels that he lost everything without 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.819
 have nothing in return then some 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.889
 way is to turn it around with the same 

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:42.210
 currency is therapeutic many times 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:43.560
 otherwise for example hitting a 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.719
 doll with the shape of your series or 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.110
 diagonal then discovered that once 

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:48.110
 that you lose
