 here we are going to pick up 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.530

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.960
 confectioner and this is penetrating this 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.439
 to be able to have no mastery in the mass 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.320
 like this 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.360
 now we will put the flour and 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.340
 You'll mix it up so you put a 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.380
 part of wheat flour and part 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.470
 defends in cashew nut flour 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.170

 I bought the 80 grams of 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.340
 cashew that was a recipe and then I 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.750
 I put it on the batting processor 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.170
 time for her to get a flour well 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:16.290
 and bought without salt without salt is the 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:21.120
 cargo box only without the beautiful shell and 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:23.209
 sensual with nothing can show in utah the 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.470
 finance a cookie in people who 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:29.580
 originally in France he was 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.739
 invented in 1890 by a confectioner who 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.830
 he had only his shop on the side of the 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.750
 search of the paris stock exchange 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.129
 then generate a little bit the store commend 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.930
 these cookies were personal 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.660
 worked in finance so 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.180
 he does not know why he did it 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:50.580
 tribute to these workers where 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:52.830
 Everyone, if I may I will put the butter 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.379
 that was already retained is also legal 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.830
 also talk to people who can use 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:01.709
 any type of nut nuts any 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.530
 thing here on the track 'if you want 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.239
 use the original is with the amendment but the 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.180
 People are already paying for a version if you 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:13.349
 Do you want to know your version at home, right? 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:16.080
 I think okay then you will make a 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:18.629
 rounded version is different from the 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.580
 that is the rectangle 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:23.550
 There, what we're going to do now is 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.409
 fill a little bit of pasta here 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.030
 because when I enter jabuticaba still 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:28.440
 Are we going to go up and do what? 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.360
 jabuticaba to stay even more 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.720
 brazilian more impossible 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.280
 just let me use other fruit od 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.670
 you can use any fruit that is 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.610
 Little thing then, if you want to use 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.640
 strawberry raspberry blueberry all 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.319
 lightning berries can use 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.120
 So what are we going to leave to think? 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.519
 When he grows up, he gets a little to 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.319
 out and will put the whole jabuticaba 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.060
 I even discovered that not all 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:56.189
 people in the world consume so I found 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.680
 they were all is because I told 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:00.629
 This is what I do as I open jabuticaba 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.840
 plays out we had in mind the way 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:04.209
 your outfit and 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.280
 I searched all over and I was like ours 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.950
 course you thing every day over 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.050
 good knowledge then we are now 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.569
 leads to the preheated oven 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.610
 200 degrees we 'll take you till you 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.709
 The end will come to realize that 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.019
 It's going to be ready, it 's quick and it's okay. 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.669
 fast at 15 minutes of that size 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.889
 so I guess maybe ten minutes already 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:26.350
 be ready and start getting 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:29.169

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.520
 with super brazilian jabuticaba 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.970

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.690
