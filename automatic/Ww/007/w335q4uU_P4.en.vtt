00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.160
 And here folks here is the groove and today I go 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.359
 bring you another bis mobile 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.280
 this time bringing a video with a 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.800
 different layout in each layout region 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.019
 for mobile games that are empire naked 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.150
 lying down and in the case the last video I 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.320
 I thought it got a little bad 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.779
 many people said they stayed 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.580
 because it was a very fast game and 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.109
 so with those two things out of 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.210
 focus you can not concentrate 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.460
 just in the middle in the bag ends up diverting 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.800
 your vision for the rest and ends up getting worse 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.920
 and I think so is this layout more 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.420
 a little a simple he will not 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.460
 100% change for all games I go 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.800
 always have the same base and change some 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.510
 things to represent the game because 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.399
 would be easier than creating a 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.210
 different for each mobile video to 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.040
 you 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.110
 and in the case of nasdaq proceeded this time 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.930
 the clippers which is a developed game 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.300
 for web games that basically meets 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.550
 indicated by your cell phone countless times 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.079
 to collect biscuit comes with these 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.879
 cookies and can buy a series of 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.129
 things at the time of the game that will make you 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.199
 to win cookies automatically as 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.960
 his presented to buy a farm of 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.140
 biscuits or a biscuit factory a 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.420
 atomic cookie generator or even 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.729
 even a substance the area of you is 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.010
 call a plutonium if that goes to you 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.330
 give thousands of biscuits per second in 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.850
 NATO announced if it is to click well then 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.490
 It was a country thing and the game was not 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.320
 has no concrete purpose, but he is 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.460
 only statistics can be 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.070
 compared with other players to 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.509
 everyone as in the case the amount of 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.610
 cookie you earn per second to 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.290
 brand of biscuit you've ever had or 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.450
 even with the amount of hours that 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.549
 You have at stake here in case you have 17 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.280
 hours but already played in a few months, right? 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.930
 because for now it 's just a game that 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.560
 You spend hours clicking your Christmas. 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.240
 cell phone 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.280
 until you make enough money in 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.600
 so dreamed of biscuits enough to 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.840
 buy some things that will give you 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.290
 that a certain amount per second and 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.880
 still have one more a specialty or 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.299
 one thing you buy in the store what you 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.969
 get up to 50% of the biscuit you win 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.700
 usually without being turned on and 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.380
 So it 's every day you buy in 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.209
 store they become more expensive with the 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.810
 So you end up coming back, person. 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.270
 only when they have money 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.970
 something pretty expensive you start well 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.470
 simple buying the auto clip things 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.300
 of the genre to later be buying 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.160
 always the port is not something 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.349
 much more expensive what turns into something 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.150
 totally robotic only by administering 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:28.959
 How much do you have to spend on that? 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.310
 moment as well as the goose itself 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.920
 also gained a version of 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.280
 Christmas that I do not probably know 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.800
 It will be taken soon and it also has 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.440
 some promises for the game that would be 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.819
 to put some assets - I do not know 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.489
 which tim but did not say which assets 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:48.280
 should be for example the one you have 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:51.549
 played an hour after or where you have 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.739
 I earn 1 million or 1 billion or 1 trillion 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.890
 per second disc is a chosen trio 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.420
 per second or even do not know the 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.459
 amount of times you clicked 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.870
 an hour and beyond that they will put 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.940
 also some things to buy 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.519
 perhaps more expensive or cheaper in 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.739
 shop but they do not tell when they 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.360
 They'll put this on and that's it folks. 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.830
 I hope you have enjoyed 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.450

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.010
