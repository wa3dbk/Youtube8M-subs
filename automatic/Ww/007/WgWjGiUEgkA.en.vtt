00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
sway a little bit and I should probably

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.410 
sway a little bit and I should probably
lean<00:00:31.470> for<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.710> little<00:00:31.859> bit<00:00:31.949> more<00:00:32.099> but<00:00:32.420> yeah

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
sort of think it's like it in AFL which

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.979 
sort of think it's like it in AFL which
is<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:23.859> football<00:03:24.430> that<00:03:24.640> I<00:03:24.760> play<00:03:24.970> we<00:03:25.660> sort<00:03:25.870> of

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
is the football that I play we sort of

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.810 
is the football that I play we sort of
went<00:03:26.109> non-stop<00:03:26.680> all<00:03:26.950> the<00:03:27.250> time<00:03:27.430> sort<00:03:27.790> of

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
went non-stop all the time sort of

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.520 
went non-stop all the time sort of
running<00:03:28.030> and<00:03:28.359> keeping<00:03:28.660> it<00:03:28.750> heart<00:03:28.989> rate<00:03:29.200> up<00:03:29.380> and

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
running and keeping it heart rate up and

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:30.750 
running and keeping it heart rate up and
so<00:03:29.739> this<00:03:29.890> is<00:03:30.010> like<00:03:30.160> a<00:03:30.190> bit<00:03:30.430> of<00:03:30.549> fitness

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
so this is like a bit of fitness

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.120 
so this is like a bit of fitness
endurance<00:03:31.660> and<00:03:32.019> strength<00:03:32.290> sort<00:03:32.680> of<00:03:32.739> thing<00:03:32.920> all

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
endurance and strength sort of thing all

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.220 
endurance and strength sort of thing all
mixed<00:03:33.400> together<00:03:33.519> so<00:03:33.850> it<00:03:33.910> fits<00:03:34.780> in<00:03:34.900> really<00:03:35.049> well

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
mixed together so it fits in really well

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.470 
mixed together so it fits in really well
with<00:03:35.350> sort<00:03:35.709> of<00:03:35.829> AFL<00:03:36.430> and<00:03:36.459> the<00:03:37.000> sort<00:03:37.269> of<00:03:37.299> thing

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
with sort of AFL and the sort of thing

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.060 
with sort of AFL and the sort of thing
that<00:03:37.600> I<00:03:37.660> need<00:03:37.810> to<00:03:37.900> do<00:03:38.820> get<00:03:39.820> back<00:03:39.970> to<00:03:40.090> my<00:03:40.180> gear

the system and like it's starting to go
like<00:04:04.209> 47<00:04:05.050> 47<00:04:05.920> and<00:04:06.040> I<00:04:06.099> when<00:04:06.220> a<00:04:06.250> BG<00:04:06.610> yesterday<00:04:07.390> and

I sort of made me feel like I was sort
of<00:04:09.610> back<00:04:09.849> in<00:04:10.000> the<00:04:10.090> swing<00:04:10.330> of<00:04:10.360> it<00:04:10.569> which<00:04:10.750> was

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
of back in the swing of it which was

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.039 
of back in the swing of it which was
awesome<00:04:11.049> i<00:04:11.640> underscore<00:04:12.640> legs<00:04:13.510> are<00:04:13.750> sort<00:04:13.959> of

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
awesome i underscore legs are sort of

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:16.199 
awesome i underscore legs are sort of
like<00:04:14.830> to<00:04:15.069> me<00:04:15.220> like<00:04:15.489> what<00:04:15.670> I've<00:04:15.760> actually<00:04:15.940> built

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
like to me like what I've actually built

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.870 
like to me like what I've actually built
up<00:04:16.419> pretty<00:04:17.169> pretty<00:04:17.919> well<00:04:18.100> just<00:04:18.400> from<00:04:18.519> running

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
up pretty pretty well just from running

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.330 
up pretty pretty well just from running
cuz<00:04:19.030> I<00:04:19.090> was<00:04:19.180> a<00:04:19.209> long-distance<00:04:19.419> runner<00:04:19.930> and

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
cuz I was a long-distance runner and

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.740 
cuz I was a long-distance runner and
legs<00:04:21.340> my<00:04:21.699> legs<00:04:21.729> are<00:04:22.000> actually<00:04:22.120> pretty<00:04:22.570> strong

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
legs my legs are actually pretty strong

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.110 
legs my legs are actually pretty strong
which<00:04:22.990> is<00:04:23.229> sort<00:04:23.470> of<00:04:23.560> it's<00:04:24.520> not<00:04:24.580> great<00:04:24.910> for<00:04:25.060> me

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
which is sort of it's not great for me

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.300 
which is sort of it's not great for me
because<00:04:25.270> wop<00:04:25.630> sides<00:04:25.930> like<00:04:26.290> my<00:04:26.770> upper<00:04:27.010> body<00:04:27.190> and

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
because wop sides like my upper body and

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.620 
because wop sides like my upper body and
that's<00:04:27.490> not<00:04:27.669> as<00:04:27.790> strong<00:04:27.970> as<00:04:28.000> my<00:04:28.120> legs<00:04:28.450> so<00:04:28.600> I

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
that's not as strong as my legs so I

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.680 
that's not as strong as my legs so I
like<00:04:28.900> I<00:04:29.169> left<00:04:29.770> a<00:04:29.919> bit<00:04:30.100> like<00:04:31.090> I<00:04:31.180> don't<00:04:31.300> lift<00:04:31.570> as

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
like I left a bit like I don't lift as

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.120 
like I left a bit like I don't lift as
much<00:04:31.930> and<00:04:32.139> leg<00:04:32.290> since<00:04:32.530> I<00:04:32.590> want<00:04:32.770> my<00:04:32.830> body<00:04:32.950> to

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
much and leg since I want my body to

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.670 
much and leg since I want my body to
catch<00:04:33.190> up<00:04:33.550> so<00:04:33.700> I'm<00:04:33.790> doing<00:04:33.910> like<00:04:34.440> 100<00:04:35.440> and<00:04:35.530> some

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
catch up so I'm doing like 100 and some

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.960 
catch up so I'm doing like 100 and some
squats<00:04:36.100> E<00:04:36.540> which<00:04:37.540> is<00:04:38.490> 207<00:04:39.490> pounds<00:04:39.760> and<00:04:39.910> I'm

squats E which is 207 pounds and I'm
still<00:04:40.540> not<00:04:40.660> that<00:04:40.720> heavy<00:04:40.990> but<00:04:41.139> I<00:04:41.200> can<00:04:41.440> load<00:04:41.590> it

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
still not that heavy but I can load it

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.590 
still not that heavy but I can load it
from<00:04:41.979> I<00:04:42.220> used<00:04:42.400> to<00:04:42.460> be<00:04:42.550> able<00:04:42.639> to<00:04:42.729> do<00:04:42.850> like<00:04:42.880> 140

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
from I used to be able to do like 140

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.550 
from I used to be able to do like 140
kilograms<00:04:44.590> watts<00:04:45.630> but<00:04:46.630> I<00:04:46.660> don't<00:04:47.229> really<00:04:47.380> want

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
kilograms watts but I don't really want

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.920 
kilograms watts but I don't really want
to<00:04:47.650> sort<00:04:47.800> of<00:04:47.889> bulk<00:04:48.100> up<00:04:48.280> my<00:04:48.430> legs<00:04:48.669> and<00:04:48.940> do<00:04:49.810> that

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
to sort of bulk up my legs and do that

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.500 
to sort of bulk up my legs and do that
anymore<00:04:50.200> because<00:04:50.470> I<00:04:51.100> want<00:04:51.430> to<00:04:51.520> still<00:04:52.180> sort<00:04:52.419> of

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
anymore because I want to still sort of

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.080 
anymore because I want to still sort of
be<00:04:52.600> a<00:04:52.630> bit<00:04:52.810> agile<00:04:53.229> and<00:04:53.500> you<00:04:54.490> know<00:04:54.580> that<00:04:54.760> sort<00:04:55.000> of

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
be a bit agile and you know that sort of

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.820 
be a bit agile and you know that sort of
thing<00:04:55.270> instead<00:04:55.660> of<00:04:55.930> being<00:04:56.139> like<00:04:56.289> real<00:04:56.470> bulky

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
thing instead of being like real bulky
