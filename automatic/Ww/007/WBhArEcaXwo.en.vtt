kinesthetic lis okay so the first part

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.330 
kinesthetic lis okay so the first part
is<00:02:00.899> connecting<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.530> source<00:02:01.829> we<00:02:02.070> want<00:02:02.280> to

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
is connecting the source we want to

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.700 
is connecting the source we want to
connect<00:02:02.670> in<00:02:02.909> up<00:02:03.180> above<00:02:03.420> our<00:02:03.570> head<00:02:03.869> is<00:02:04.140> that
