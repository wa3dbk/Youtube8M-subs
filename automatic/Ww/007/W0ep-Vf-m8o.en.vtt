00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:51.360
 not realizing that both he and xbox 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:55.570
 as in pc that put these paths to 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:58.860
 Right usb microphone microphones here where 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:14.489
 I was going to have one, it was normal. 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:14.489

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:37.290

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:42.840
 loose will not leave anything and play in usb 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.840
 the people coming here in the 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:59.049
 audio setup and select the 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:14.049

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:18.340

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.060
 accessories 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:34.300
 the reason for entering the exit section 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:37.000
 pnp usb are the waf your chances of 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:41.349
 to leave the sbt bnp santos de varzim because 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:45.220
 the level of the same profane 3 and 7 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:48.540
 it has very good sound insulation 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:51.730
 so I listen very little to my voice 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.580
 with headset when listening to a headset 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.680
 voice discussion a little bit then I finish 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.640
 talking much louder what I say 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.300
 normally 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.519
 so I make the microphone down and 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.680
 leaving three because if I left 15 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:08.410
 that is not normal everyone I was going 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.620
 talk too loud so it's personal 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.720
