let's start we want to take a 17

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.580 
let's start we want to take a 17
millimeter<00:00:18.890> socket<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.300> the<00:00:21.300> ratchet<00:00:21.750> put

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
millimeter socket and the ratchet put

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.630 
millimeter socket and the ratchet put
them<00:00:22.769> together<00:00:23.060> like<00:00:24.060> that<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:27.019> take<00:00:28.019> this<00:00:28.980> 17

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
them together like that and take this 17

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.720 
them together like that and take this 17
millimeter<00:00:30.150> off<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:31.050> top<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:31.949> holds<00:00:33.230> the

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
millimeter off the top that holds the

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.450 
millimeter off the top that holds the
caliper<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:36.030> entire<00:00:36.360> system<00:00:36.950> in<00:00:37.950> place<00:00:38.190> and

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
caliper the entire system in place and

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.510 
caliper the entire system in place and
there<00:00:39.270> is<00:00:39.300> one<00:00:39.690> on<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.680> bottom<00:00:40.890> right<00:00:41.219> here

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
there is one on the bottom right here

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.420 
there is one on the bottom right here
which<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.510> also<00:00:42.750> need<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.230> take<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:44.370> to

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
which you also need to take so to

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.490 
which you also need to take so to
replace<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.879> brake<00:00:45.239> pads<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.960> if<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.260> remove

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
replace the brake pads and if you remove

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.130 
replace the brake pads and if you remove
these<00:00:47.190> two<00:00:48.020> 14<00:00:49.020> millimetres<00:00:49.910> one<00:00:50.910> here<00:00:51.329> and

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
these two 14 millimetres one here and

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.189 
these two 14 millimetres one here and
another<00:00:52.350> one<00:00:52.649> here<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:53.610> basically<00:00:53.969> take<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.750> 14

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
another one here so basically take a 14

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.700 
another one here so basically take a 14
millimeter<00:00:56.239> socket<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:58.250> take<00:00:59.250> these<00:00:59.850> off

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
millimeter socket and take these off

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:07.310 
millimeter socket and take these off
which<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.829> pretty<00:01:02.309> easy<00:01:04.129> there<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.189> go<00:01:06.170> put<00:01:07.170> it

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
which is pretty easy there you go put it

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.140 
which is pretty easy there you go put it
in<00:01:08.189> there<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:08.810> it<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:09.930> not<00:01:10.140> hanging<00:01:10.380> on<00:01:11.150> the

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
in there so it is not hanging on the

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.969 
in there so it is not hanging on the
brake<00:01:12.390> line<00:01:13.760> right<00:01:14.760> there

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
brake line right there

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.719 
brake line right there
so<00:01:16.820> it's<00:01:16.909> not<00:01:17.060> paying<00:01:17.299> just<00:01:17.890> put<00:01:18.890> it<00:01:18.979> aside

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:27.279 

pick<00:01:22.729> the<00:01:22.880> brake<00:01:23.090> pads<00:01:23.329> out<00:01:26.020> and<00:01:27.020> there<00:01:27.170> is

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:27.289 
pick the brake pads out and there is

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:31.870 
pick the brake pads out and there is
there<00:01:27.409> another<00:01:27.649> brake<00:01:28.280> pad<00:01:29.110> you<00:01:30.110> can<00:01:30.640> and<00:01:31.640> now

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
there another brake pad you can and now

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:41.169 
there another brake pad you can and now
take<00:01:32.390> your<00:01:32.539> this<00:01:32.780> off<00:01:34.840> yes<00:01:38.799> that's<00:01:39.799> it<00:01:40.179> okay

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
now you got the disk off you can clean

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:54.510 
now you got the disk off you can clean
the<00:01:45.110> surface<00:01:46.000> take<00:01:47.000> a<00:01:47.060> brass<00:01:47.689> brush<00:01:49.479> and<00:01:50.479> just

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:02.109 

on<00:01:55.599> here<00:01:57.069> just<00:01:58.069> like<00:01:58.189> this<00:01:59.860> okay<00:02:00.860> this<00:02:01.579> is<00:02:01.759> the
