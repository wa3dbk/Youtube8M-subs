00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
lose clarity by getting a really small

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.219 
lose clarity by getting a really small
image<00:01:40.250> you're<00:01:40.369> making<00:01:40.609> it<00:01:40.670> really<00:01:40.850> big<00:01:41.229> now

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
image you're making it really big now

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:43.690 
image you're making it really big now
there<00:01:42.380> are<00:01:42.439> a<00:01:42.469> number<00:01:42.500> of<00:01:42.710> ways<00:01:42.920> I<00:01:43.189> can<00:01:43.340> get<00:01:43.460> and

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
there are a number of ways I can get and

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.520 
there are a number of ways I can get and
the<00:01:43.850> background<00:01:44.270> out<00:01:44.420> of<00:01:44.450> this<00:01:44.659> now<00:01:45.170> I'm<00:01:45.320> quite

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
the background out of this now I'm quite

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.080 
the background out of this now I'm quite
lucky<00:01:45.770> because<00:01:46.130> the<00:01:46.310> background<00:01:46.520> is<00:01:46.820> fairly

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
lucky because the background is fairly

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.510 
lucky because the background is fairly
light<00:01:47.469> you<00:01:48.469> might<00:01:48.770> find<00:01:49.009> that<00:01:49.159> you've<00:01:49.310> got<00:01:49.429> an

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
light you might find that you've got an

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.980 
light you might find that you've got an
image<00:01:49.759> where<00:01:50.030> it's<00:01:50.119> got<00:01:50.240> a<00:01:50.270> lot<00:01:50.539> going<00:01:50.749> on<00:01:50.869> the

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
image where it's got a lot going on the

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.160 
image where it's got a lot going on the
background<00:01:51.170> and<00:01:51.670> it's<00:01:52.780> same<00:01:53.780> technique

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
background and it's same technique

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.550 
background and it's same technique
slightly<00:01:54.890> more<00:01:55.810> time-consuming<00:01:56.810> so<00:01:57.439> there's

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
slightly more time-consuming so there's

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.870 
slightly more time-consuming so there's
a<00:01:57.590> number<00:01:57.679> of<00:01:57.859> ways<00:01:58.130> I<00:01:58.280> can<00:01:58.429> do<00:01:58.490> I<00:01:58.520> can<00:01:58.700> choose<00:01:58.850> a

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
a number of ways I can do I can choose a

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.929 
a number of ways I can do I can choose a
magic<00:01:59.270> one<00:01:59.479> tool<00:01:59.780> here<00:02:00.759> click<00:02:01.759> on<00:02:01.789> the

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
magic one tool here click on the

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.149 
magic one tool here click on the
backgrounds<00:02:02.539> and<00:02:02.689> it<00:02:03.049> picks<00:02:03.289> out<00:02:03.469> you<00:02:04.039> know

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
backgrounds and it picks out you know

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.290 
backgrounds and it picks out you know
most<00:02:04.549> of<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:04.759> background<00:02:05.299> and<00:02:06.969> I<00:02:07.969> can<00:02:08.119> change

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
most of the background and I can change

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.540 
most of the background and I can change
the<00:02:08.420> tolerance<00:02:08.630> up<00:02:08.960> here<00:02:09.789> the<00:02:12.400> another<00:02:13.400> one

what<00:04:23.750> happens<00:04:24.050> here<00:04:24.290> it's<00:04:24.650> because<00:04:24.830> I've<00:04:24.950> got

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
what happens here it's because I've got

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.710 
what happens here it's because I've got
the<00:04:25.190> red<00:04:25.400> show<00:04:25.640> the<00:04:25.970> black<00:04:26.150> showing<00:04:26.390> here<00:04:26.630> if

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
the red show the black showing here if

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.800 
the red show the black showing here if
like<00:04:26.870> reverse<00:04:27.410> round<00:04:28.479> and<00:04:29.479> get<00:04:29.630> the<00:04:29.690> white

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
like reverse round and get the white

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:38.810 
like reverse round and get the white
I<00:04:30.860> can<00:04:31.860> then<00:04:34.160> trace<00:04:35.160> put<00:04:35.970> the<00:04:37.460> okay<00:04:38.460> so<00:04:38.639> just

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
I can then trace put the okay so just

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.970 
I can then trace put the okay so just
color<00:04:39.060> it<00:04:39.240> in<00:04:39.389> and<00:04:39.660> be<00:04:40.080> quite<00:04:40.470> accurate<00:04:40.650> if<00:04:40.889> I

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
color it in and be quite accurate if I

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.129 
color it in and be quite accurate if I
just<00:04:41.130> press<00:04:41.310> command<00:04:42.150> on<00:04:42.389> Apple<00:04:42.720> I<00:04:42.750> think<00:04:42.870> it's

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
just press command on Apple I think it's

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.800 
just press command on Apple I think it's
controlling<00:04:43.710> Windows<00:04:44.460> just<00:04:44.760> zoom<00:04:45.630> in

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
controlling Windows just zoom in

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:52.480 
controlling Windows just zoom in
slightly<00:04:48.020> and<00:04:49.250> pick<00:04:50.250> up<00:04:50.430> the<00:04:50.580> rest<00:04:50.760> of<00:04:50.970> this
