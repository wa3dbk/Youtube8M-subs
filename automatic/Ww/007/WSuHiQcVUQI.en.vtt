00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
easiest way to start so basically you're

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.250 
easiest way to start so basically you're
gonna<00:00:25.619> do<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:26.130> from<00:00:26.789> behind<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.990> in<00:00:28.109> front

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
gonna do it from behind you to in front

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.700 
gonna do it from behind you to in front
of<00:00:28.470> you<00:00:28.619> behind<00:00:29.250> in<00:00:29.730> front<00:00:29.970> time<00:00:30.869> in<00:00:31.349> front

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
of you behind in front time in front

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.660 
of you behind in front time in front
behind<00:00:32.399> in<00:00:32.940> front<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:34.790> with<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.000> basic<00:00:36.420> weave

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
behind in front and with the basic weave

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.910 
behind in front and with the basic weave
my<00:00:38.670> elbow<00:00:39.120> does<00:00:39.329> not<00:00:39.480> pass<00:00:39.809> my<00:00:40.230> side<00:00:41.450> because

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
my elbow does not pass my side because

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.250 
my elbow does not pass my side because
you<00:00:43.920> have<00:00:44.070> more<00:00:44.250> control<00:00:44.660> your<00:00:45.660> wrist<00:00:45.960> is

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
you have more control your wrist is

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.750 
you have more control your wrist is
going<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.559> be<00:00:46.739> what's<00:00:47.039> doing<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.550> most

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
going to be what's doing the most

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.779 
going to be what's doing the most
movement<00:00:48.030> your<00:00:48.989> arm<00:00:49.200> up<00:00:49.920> here<00:00:50.309> doesn't<00:00:50.640> really

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
movement your arm up here doesn't really

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.439 
movement your arm up here doesn't really
move<00:00:51.090> at<00:00:51.239> all<00:00:51.829> so<00:00:52.829> this<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.670> your<00:00:53.879> basic<00:00:54.239> leave

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
move at all so this is your basic leave

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.119 
move at all so this is your basic leave
and<00:00:54.930> if<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.739> can<00:00:55.980> see<00:00:56.539> it<00:00:57.539> I'd<00:00:58.230> never<00:00:58.770> have<00:00:59.100> a

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
and if you can see it I'd never have a

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.790 
and if you can see it I'd never have a
full<00:00:59.430> grip<00:00:59.640> on<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.030> it's<00:01:00.300> only<00:01:00.719> gonna<00:01:01.020> be<00:01:01.320> like

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
full grip on it it's only gonna be like

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.520 
full grip on it it's only gonna be like
resting<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:02.730> my<00:01:02.760> fingers<00:01:03.329> my<00:01:03.989> fingers<00:01:04.350> are

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
resting in my fingers my fingers are

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.969 
resting in my fingers my fingers are
gonna<00:01:04.619> be<00:01:04.890> halfway<00:01:05.159> curled<00:01:05.760> around<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.979> this

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
gonna be halfway curled around it this

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.000 
gonna be halfway curled around it this
is<00:01:08.220> what<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:08.520> find<00:01:08.939> easiest<00:01:09.510> because<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.770> still

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
is what I find easiest because you still

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.340 
is what I find easiest because you still
have<00:01:11.220> control<00:01:11.490> with<00:01:12.030> your<00:01:12.240> thumb<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.140> your

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
have control with your thumb and your

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.590 
have control with your thumb and your
index<00:01:13.380> finger<00:01:14.070> that's<00:01:14.790> gonna<00:01:14.939> give<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.299> your

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
index finger that's gonna give you your

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.980 
index finger that's gonna give you your
most<00:01:15.840> control<00:01:16.520> when<00:01:17.520> trying<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.090> move<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.780> with

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
most control when trying to move it with

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.730 
most control when trying to move it with
your<00:01:19.200> wrist<00:01:19.790> so<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:21.330> typically<00:01:24.110> when<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.140> started

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
your wrist so I typically when I started

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.080 
your wrist so I typically when I started
I<00:01:26.009> would<00:01:26.670> keep<00:01:27.240> my<00:01:27.570> thumb<00:01:28.369> when<00:01:29.369> I<00:01:29.400> would<00:01:29.759> go<00:01:29.909> in

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
I would keep my thumb when I would go in

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.120 
I would keep my thumb when I would go in
front<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.450> me<00:01:30.659> on<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.920> hoop<00:01:32.100> as<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:33.119> can<00:01:33.299> see

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
front of me on the hoop as you can see

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.270 
front of me on the hoop as you can see
and<00:01:35.130> then<00:01:35.880> when<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.150> put<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.540> behind<00:01:36.689> me<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.470> would

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
and then when I put it behind me I would

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.450 
and then when I put it behind me I would
let<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.490> go<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:39.680> don't<00:01:40.680> know<00:01:40.860> if<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.130> works<00:01:41.310> for

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
let it go I don't know if that works for

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.069 
let it go I don't know if that works for
you<00:01:41.579> guys<00:01:41.850> but<00:01:42.180> that's<00:01:42.299> what<00:01:42.540> worked<00:01:42.720> for<00:01:42.960> me

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
you guys but that's what worked for me

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.179 
you guys but that's what worked for me
so<00:01:43.610> but<00:01:44.610> now<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:45.420> just<00:01:45.840> kind<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.350> let<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.619> move<00:01:46.799> in

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
so but now I just kind of let it move in

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.350 
so but now I just kind of let it move in
my<00:01:47.460> hand<00:01:47.930> because<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.229> makes<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.590> easier<00:01:49.950> for

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
my hand because it makes it easier for

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.590 
my hand because it makes it easier for
it<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.509> move<00:01:51.780> back<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.320> forth<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:53.149> this<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.390> the

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
it to move back and forth so this is the

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.889 
it to move back and forth so this is the
basic<00:01:54.930> weave<00:01:57.380> from<00:01:58.380> here<00:01:59.450> once<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.659> bring

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
basic weave from here once you bring

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.429 
basic weave from here once you bring
your<00:02:01.560> hoop<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.399> front<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.820> you<00:02:03.259> you're<00:02:04.259> going

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
your hoop in front of you you're going

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.410 
your hoop in front of you you're going
to<00:02:04.500> just<00:02:04.680> extend<00:02:05.009> your<00:02:05.250> arm<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:06.299> I<00:02:06.869> have<00:02:08.420> I'm

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
to just extend your arm and I have I'm

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.730 
to just extend your arm and I have I'm
in<00:02:09.690> my<00:02:09.810> house<00:02:10.050> side<00:02:10.410> swing

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
in my house side swing

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.220 
in my house side swing
so<00:02:12.310> I<00:02:12.700> can't<00:02:13.150> really<00:02:13.450> extend<00:02:13.990> that<00:02:14.140> I'm

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
so I can't really extend that I'm

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.820 
so I can't really extend that I'm
completely<00:02:14.650> but<00:02:15.610> this<00:02:15.790> is<00:02:16.030> where<00:02:16.900> my<00:02:16.930> my<00:02:17.560> arm

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
completely but this is where my my arm

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.380 
completely but this is where my my arm
is<00:02:18.010> gonna<00:02:18.190> be<00:02:18.280> extended<00:02:18.670> when<00:02:18.820> I<00:02:18.850> bring<00:02:19.120> it<00:02:19.270> in

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
is gonna be extended when I bring it in

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.350 
is gonna be extended when I bring it in
front<00:02:19.630> of<00:02:19.720> me<00:02:19.870> and<00:02:20.170> this<00:02:21.100> is<00:02:21.310> where<00:02:21.490> it<00:02:21.880> gets<00:02:22.120> a

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
front of me and this is where it gets a
