00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
kind of key differences between the

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.610 
kind of key differences between the
Nokia<00:00:05.250> Lumia<00:00:05.279> 520<00:00:06.180> and<00:00:06.270> the<00:00:06.390> nokia<00:00:06.690> lumia<00:00:06.720> 620

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
Nokia Lumia 520 and the nokia lumia 620

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.500 
Nokia Lumia 520 and the nokia lumia 620
so<00:00:08.189> first<00:00:08.429> of<00:00:08.519> all<00:00:08.610> as<00:00:08.880> you<00:00:09.030> can<00:00:09.179> see<00:00:09.330> the

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
so first of all as you can see the

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.419 
so first of all as you can see the
design<00:00:09.840> is<00:00:10.050> different<00:00:10.230> so<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:10.740> 620<00:00:11.250> is

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
design is different so the 620 is

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.030 
design is different so the 620 is
slightly<00:00:11.759> more<00:00:11.910> compact<00:00:12.480> with<00:00:12.660> 3.8<00:00:13.410> in

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
slightly more compact with 3.8 in

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.760 
slightly more compact with 3.8 in
straight<00:00:14.400> back<00:00:14.610> display<00:00:15.080> velocity<00:00:16.080> at<00:00:16.529> the

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
straight back display velocity at the

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.390 
straight back display velocity at the
Nokia<00:00:17.070> Lumia<00:00:17.119> 520<00:00:18.119> has<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.270> 4-inch<00:00:18.539> display<00:00:18.869> and

Nokia Lumia 520 has a 4-inch display and
the<00:00:20.400> design<00:00:20.970> is<00:00:21.210> slightly<00:00:21.869> different<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:22.500> of

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
the design is slightly different and of

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.460 
the design is slightly different and of
course<00:00:22.890> in<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.760> nokia<00:00:24.060> lumia<00:00:24.359> 620<00:00:24.960> we<00:00:25.080> have<00:00:25.289> the

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
course in a nokia lumia 620 we have the

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.570 
course in a nokia lumia 620 we have the
dual<00:00:26.340> layer<00:00:26.960> polycarbonate<00:00:27.960> shell<00:00:28.710> so<00:00:29.519> you

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
dual layer polycarbonate shell so you

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.269 
dual layer polycarbonate shell so you

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
gigabyte of storage in both and then you

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.899 
gigabyte of storage in both and then you
have<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.840> micro<00:01:10.140> SD<00:01:10.380> card<00:01:10.890> slot<00:01:11.010> as<00:01:11.430> as<00:01:11.640> well

then<00:01:31.170> about<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.530> bed<00:01:31.680> back<00:01:32.010> cameras<00:01:32.400> are

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
then about the bed back cameras are

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.420 
then about the bed back cameras are
loose<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:33.509> camera<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.290> senior<00:01:34.860> in<00:01:35.220> terms

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
loose that camera is the senior in terms

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.370 
loose that camera is the senior in terms
of<00:01:35.610> megapixels<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.600> five<00:01:36.780> megapixel

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
of megapixels of five megapixel

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.130 
of megapixels of five megapixel
autofocus<00:01:37.549> but<00:01:38.549> 620<00:01:39.180> has<00:01:39.299> fast<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.810> fast<00:01:39.990> and

autofocus but 620 has fast and fast and

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.270 
autofocus but 620 has fast and fast and
it<00:01:40.229> doesn't<00:01:40.500> have<00:01:40.680> class<00:01:41.180> then<00:01:42.180> another

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
it doesn't have class then another

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.639 
it doesn't have class then another
difference<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.549> nokia<00:01:45.479> lumia<00:01:46.020> 620<00:01:46.530> has

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
difference is that nokia lumia 620 has

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.789 
difference is that nokia lumia 620 has
NFC<00:01:47.070> first<00:01:47.549> when<00:01:47.729> she<00:01:47.909> does<00:01:48.060> not<00:01:48.270> have<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.799> NFC

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
NFC first when she does not have the NFC

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.330 
NFC first when she does not have the NFC
then<00:01:50.729> on<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.240> experiences<00:01:51.960> side

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
then on the on the experiences side

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.460 
then on the on the experiences side
there<00:01:53.340> are<00:01:53.369> some<00:01:53.640> small<00:01:54.539> differences<00:01:54.930> there

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
there are some small differences there

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.279 
there are some small differences there
as<00:01:55.560> well<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:55.799> for<00:01:56.159> example<00:01:56.220> in<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.880> here

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
as well so for example in the here

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.190
