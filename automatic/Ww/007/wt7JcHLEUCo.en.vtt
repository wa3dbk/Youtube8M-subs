00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
crease rather than just here if you add

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.740 
crease rather than just here if you add

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
the crease it just gives you that

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.309 
the crease it just gives you that
illusion<00:02:24.340> of<00:02:24.550> a<00:02:24.640> lifted<00:02:24.819> eye<00:02:25.150> so<00:02:25.720> far<00:02:26.019> so<00:02:26.290> good

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
illusion of a lifted eye so far so good

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.050

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
little bit to the brush and it's really

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:32.520 
little bit to the brush and it's really
transferring<00:02:30.760> nicely<00:02:31.180> onto<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.540> skin<00:02:31.870> what

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.580 
it looks really pretty for like a night
out<00:05:11.490> so<00:05:11.880> once<00:05:12.090> the<00:05:12.240> color<00:05:12.449> is<00:05:12.599> on<00:05:12.870> how<00:05:13.229> you<00:05:13.289> like

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.379 
out so once the color is on how you like
it<00:05:13.830> I'm<00:05:13.979> just<00:05:14.370> going<00:05:14.580> to<00:05:14.639> take<00:05:14.789> the<00:05:14.970> blending

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
it I'm just going to take the blending

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:17.360 
it I'm just going to take the blending
brush<00:05:15.599> again<00:05:15.780> and<00:05:16.199> just<00:05:16.349> go<00:05:16.470> over<00:05:16.860> top<00:05:17.099> of<00:05:17.159> this

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
brush again and just go over top of this

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.700 
brush again and just go over top of this
so<00:05:17.580> there's<00:05:17.760> no<00:05:18.030> hard<00:05:18.630> edges<00:05:18.990> in<00:05:19.470> the<00:05:19.560> middle

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
so there's no hard edges in the middle

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.920 
so there's no hard edges in the middle
you<00:05:20.370> get<00:05:20.520> that<00:05:20.729> content<00:05:21.120> to<00:05:21.210> happen<00:05:21.690> if<00:05:21.840> you

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
you get that content to happen if you

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.390 
you get that content to happen if you
just<00:05:21.960> leave<00:05:22.260> it<00:05:22.380> like<00:05:22.409> this<00:05:22.530> compared<00:05:23.190> to<00:05:23.250> this

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
just leave it like this compared to this

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.029 
just leave it like this compared to this
side<00:05:23.639> so<00:05:24.180> just<00:05:24.210> go<00:05:24.570> and<00:05:24.960> blend<00:05:25.349> over<00:05:25.500> top<00:05:25.860> you

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:26.039 
side so just go and blend over top you

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:28.520 
side so just go and blend over top you
can<00:05:26.220> even<00:05:26.430> just<00:05:26.550> run<00:05:26.760> your<00:05:26.909> brush<00:05:27.030> brush<00:05:27.960> over

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
can even just run your brush brush over

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.010 
can even just run your brush brush over
top<00:05:28.800> so<00:05:29.130> it's<00:05:29.280> more<00:05:29.520> of<00:05:29.610> a<00:05:29.669> subtle<00:05:30.060> look<00:05:30.210> but<00:05:30.930> if

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
top so it's more of a subtle look but if

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.080 
top so it's more of a subtle look but if
you<00:05:31.139> do<00:05:31.320> want<00:05:31.530> a<00:05:31.560> little<00:05:31.590> bit<00:05:31.919> more<00:05:31.979> glitz<00:05:32.820> and

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
you do want a little bit more glitz and

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.240 
you do want a little bit more glitz and
glam<00:05:33.330> you<00:05:33.630> can<00:05:33.780> put<00:05:33.960> a<00:05:33.990> little<00:05:34.380> bit<00:05:34.620> more<00:05:35.039> in

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
glam you can put a little bit more in

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.240 
glam you can put a little bit more in
the<00:05:35.430> center<00:05:36.440> and<00:05:37.440> I'm<00:05:37.530> going<00:05:37.650> to<00:05:37.680> take<00:05:37.919> some<00:05:38.220> of
