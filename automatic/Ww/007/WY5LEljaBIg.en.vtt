00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:13.950
 hello to all his doubts his captains 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.630
 has now center today for a 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.839
 little khama trick that works very very 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.910
 well 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.910
 we are in front of the almanac so 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.279
 as you know the almanac it's a 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.830
 repeatable quest every day at wholesale 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.060
 who offers you a dofus at the end and therefore 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.760
 for this quest you need some 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.059
 resources so every day exchanges and 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.540
 so the trick is all stupid must know 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.030
 that logically yielded resources that no 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.460
 not worth very much in normal times 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.930
 and who take that easily take 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.010
 2 to 3 times the price of the day 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.590
 needs it for the manna axes in 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.840
 the occurrence yesterday it was the hairs of 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.210
 pandore so be aware that I 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.829
 bought them right I bought them the 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.489
 so sure he had already taken 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.559
 a little value 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.629
 the next day it was the sown almanac 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.280
 imagine that I had taken them I know 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.129
 not a week before their price would have 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.420
 been ridiculous compared yesterday to the price of 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.659
 day of the almanac so basically I 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.210
 bought 150 thousand the 10 I have 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.400
 bought 40 a meaning to fifteen thousand units 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.470
 So I therefore I kept two 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.630
 points in German axis and I have them 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.270
 resold to 43 thousand units 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.310
 I put them at 43 miles and they are 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.990
 so gone every day from the almanac 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.610
 so I got it for 600 miles of 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.240
 resell buying and so I have them 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.740
 sold the ten I said I had 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.650
 bought 40 and I got it for a million 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.030
 seven resale so basically it made me 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.350
 a kid without doing anything a million in 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.369
 but really without doing anything because 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.759
 you just have to buy them the 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.079
 put back for direct sale today I 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.270
 believe it's the most shameful 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.530
 and then jumping me when I got them 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.770
 bought at the beginning of the week for 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.939
 to make my almanac I paid them 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.450
 millecam to unity not even I believe that 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.310
 it was like it had to be 515 to unity 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.329
 I had 1000 cases in all 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.159
 they resell at 10,000 so x 10 then 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.799
 obviously the top it was was a 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.649
 man walking in front of the almanac this but 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.670
 it's not necessarily necessary 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.910
 just put them in hd 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.680
 so here are the most 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.209
 shameful con who are still 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.250
 cheaper than the other but good at all 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.349
 case and you can easily sell them 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.280
 each time two or three times their 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.110
 original price 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.940
 without doing anything and it works very very 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.430
 well so in fact what you need to 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.700
 do I'm going to show you there you 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.750
 so just go to the dofus website 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.750
 we will go there 1 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.040
 then you go so you are looking for 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.780
 almanac this then I will confess that 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.060
 I do not often the herd is 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.380
 there I do for a friend so I know 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.920
 not too much where these but hey it has to be 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.010
 somewhere 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:51.739
 no I do not know me 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:56.030
 encyclopedia here is the cyclopede jamanak 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:58.640
 this and so you have well and all 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.769
 resources needed for the axis manna 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.939
 so every day for example 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.730
 today it is the most shameful 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:05.739
 then you click on the next day eh 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.200
 well it will be 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.239
 this is the stuff here etc etc 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.940
 so the goal obviously is the 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.530
 buy in advance so try to you 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.940
 take it I do not know a week or 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.140
 two weeks to the advanced story of 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.269
 really grab the resources we have 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.299
 the price has not yet climbed you in 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:25.040
 buy a quantity I do not know if 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:29.840
 please what and you put them so 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:32.840
 on sale the day j to make you 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.670
 kamas and then and then that's what and then 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.220
 it's something that will work will everything 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.379
 time because inevitably in time 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.220
 normal the demand for these resources is 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:41.269
 very weak 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.470
 since it's resources that do not 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.109
 do not serve much generally 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.790
 and the day of the nakba the demand is 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:48.200
 very high because everyone has it 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.489
 finally need all those doing the quest 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.409
 there are still a lot of people 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:54.530
 who are doing this quest because she 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:56.030
 reports a quest at each end each 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.949
 day and reports a quest to validate 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:02.359
 so for the success kate it's huge 

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:04.760
 see for salah so basically after 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:06.620
 365 days you will have 365 which is 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.500
 for free in addition to that and you 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.590
 gives a lot of xp a look at the 3 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:15.139
 million xp practically and then and 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.120
 then you have also so souls at 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:20.389
 so here savoie brings a lot of 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.919
 things we hold not so brief so 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.990
 do not hesitate to abuse this 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.340
 technique it works very well my no 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.780
 there to the fuzziness of the interior of the 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.639
 joystick like that was done in the beginning 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.199
 will be for those who remember there 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:34.070
 had 4 billion people inside 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:34.539
 Wind wind that swoon is that blah blah blah in 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.500
 short 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:38.210
 so here is not hesitate to put a 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.860
