like<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.659> champion<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.560> he<00:01:28.799> has<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.040> little

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
like a champion so he has a little

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.679 
like a champion so he has a little
advantage<00:01:29.820> in<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:31.229> lenses<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.420> by<00:01:33.420> building

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
advantage in the lenses and by building

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.630 
advantage in the lenses and by building
up<00:01:33.990> this<00:01:34.229> they<00:01:34.650> don't<00:01:34.860> advantage<00:01:35.400> about

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
up this they don't advantage about

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.289 
up this they don't advantage about
accumulating<00:01:36.000> them<00:01:36.479> he's<00:01:37.320> gaining<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.950> lot<00:01:38.130> of
