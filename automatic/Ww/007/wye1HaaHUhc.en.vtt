00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:06.390
 hello on air our special 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.719
 heading and chemists he is with you i'm sergey 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.920
 and goji scientists have long established that 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.509
 some countries quantity 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.969
 cardiovascular diseases 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.520
 much lower than others with than this 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.640
 only not associated with 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.939
 eating fat-rich fish why 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.980
 some fats are harmful and others are beneficial in 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.390
 this we will understand today in 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.390
 our heading chemistry body 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.850
 Good day, hello, how are you 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.050
 super 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:41.080
 this is good sauce key chain on in the studio i 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:44.680
 heard that when you play sports you need 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.780
 eat omega-3 fatty acids here 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.129
 that is, either muscle mass gain there 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.760
 either there at fitness 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:53.530
 weight dumping wanted to know but is it 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.019
 it 's actually more detail that because 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.440
 acid let's understand 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:00.730
 omega-3 fatty acids what they 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.840
 necessary for normal 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.080
 human activity 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.210
 the body was here in 1930 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.220
 judged that as a result of various 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.690
 the latter was revealed that those countries 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.479
 where are the consumption of products which 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.039
 rich in fatty acids high in 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.110
 these countries have significantly lower risk 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:19.360
 cardiovascular diseases such 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.810
 countries like japan 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.640
 it is there that fish populations use 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.280
 and seafood are associated with the fact that 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.800
 very long life expectancy and 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.690
 while low cardiovascular risk 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.240
 diseases and how they affect 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.479
 on life expectancy now 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.000
 explain actually polyunsaturated 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.630
 fatty acids and those products that they 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.330
 are rich 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.270
 getting into the human body 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.220
 absorbed through the intestinal wall and this 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.110
 leads to multiple effects 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.630
 First of all 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.880
 omega-3 fatty acids affect 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.310
 rheological properties of blood viz. 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.869
 blood starts to flow better through the bloodstream 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.869
 vessels are less likely 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.790
 formation of blood clots in the second 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.119
 polyunsaturated fatty acids improve 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.610
 vascular wall condition 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.579
 impeded the development there 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.470
 atherosclerotic plaques plus everything 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:17.430
 Omega-3 fatty acids is part of 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.470
 human brain cell membranes 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.049
 proven to use foods 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.420
 rich in these substances positively 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:28.060
 affects a person's ability 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.300
 memorize information and recycle 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.520
 her 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.290
 in addition, omega-3 fatty acids 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.150
 also have a positive effect on work 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.780
 liver and 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.780
 on the condition of the joints the whole point is that 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.800
 from these fatty acids are formed 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.980
 substances 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.000
 prostaglandins that possess 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.400
 anti-inflammatory effect 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.620
 most reduced joint damage 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.290
 in this way 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.790
 omega-3 fatty acids also affect 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:00.200
 cardiovascular and nervous 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:03.240
 system and on the liver and joints 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:07.170
 Tell me Sergey, I understand that for 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.580
 it is necessary to eat fish in reality 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.950
 some more 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.010
 30-40 years ago I would answer this 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.370
 the question is positive now alas I can not 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.020
 the thing is that lately 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.730
 the fish that we eat this fish 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.490
 which is grown on special farms 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.540
 where feed and pipes are predominantly 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.610
 feed 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.220
 and the thing is that omega 3 is fatty 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.290
 acids enter the body of fish from 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.970
 marine plankton for precisely this 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.760
 reason has a beneficial effect 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.820
 only fish caught directly in 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.810
 the sea and it is desirable that it be 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.820
 cold northern seas 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.430
 beyond that in order to get 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.930
 enough of these substances 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:51.510
 you need to consume fish almost every 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:55.440
 the day that is 5 6 times a week is so 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:58.800
 often and so i cant eat 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.930
 in a different way you have long been 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.630
 known ways how to use 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.630
 enough omega-3 fatty 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:09.000
 acids using special preparations one 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.610
 of these drugs is fish oil 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.260
 which has long been known to mankind and 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.540
 since ancient times applied for 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.480
 prevention of vitamin d deficiency 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:21.239
 for example or for the purpose of delivering to 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.669
 the body is enough omega 3 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.140
 fatty acids 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:27.330
 alternative to fish oil for those people 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:30.180
 who don't like the smell of fish is 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.890
 and linseed oil the whole thing is what is it 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.470
 one of the few vegetable oils 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.449
 which also contains omega 3 fatty 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.069
 acids 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:42.139
 The disadvantage of these forms is that 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:44.300
 fish oil and flaxseed oil are enough 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.039
 quick burn call'd therefore store them 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.379
 can only be in the fridge and 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:51.589
 use after you opened 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:54.680
 capacity for a month otherwise 

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:56.569
 there is a process of fat oxidation and 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:00.020
 the result instead of the benefit you get 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:05:02.870
 harm and how then to act in such 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.120
 If we get more harm than 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:09.229
 benefits actually have long been 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.099
 produce fish oil here in such 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:13.129
 capsule 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:15.860
 this capsule is sealed and accordingly not 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:19.099
 in contact with air oxidation is not 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:21.259
 happens and plus to all of course such 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:24.770
 capsules are very easily dosed by consuming 

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:27.740
 April 2 capsules during the day is about three 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:30.020
 grams of fish oil you get 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.759
 enough omega-3 fatty 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.139
 acids 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:35.059
 which are necessary for our body 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:38.300
 plus everything to prevent 

00:05:35.059 --> 00:05:40.999
 oxidation in the same capsule add another 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:44.539
 vitamin e tocopherol which inhibits 

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:46.310
 field oxidation of saturated fatty acids 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:48.110
 for this reason they have 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.599
 much longer shelf life can 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:53.870
 stored at room temperature and not 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:56.719
 about garkat yes and how about here growth 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:59.689
 muscle mass really gives such 

00:05:56.719 --> 00:06:01.279
 the effect is actually right here just 

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:02.689
 the effect is very slight though 

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:05.180
 there is a study which 

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:06.740
 shows that the effectiveness of training 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.629
 increases slightly if the person 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.610
 takes 

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:12.979
 omega-3 fatty acids but statistically 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.110
 this data is unreliable 

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:16.819
 that is actually say what it is 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.810
 powerful anabolic drug can not 

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:23.479
 here, after all, the main thing is training 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:25.729
 but even the effect on the cardiovascular and 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:27.529
 nervous system is enough for that 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:29.899
 to this drug and regularly 

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:32.419
 eat and what should still 

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:33.720
 need to take an adult 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:36.540
 man daily 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:39.930
 about two or three grams depending 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:41.610
 body weight usually dosage of either 500 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:44.520
 milligrams or 1000 milligrams 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:48.540
 accordingly it is from two to four 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:50.960
 capsules for no well you all 

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:55.380
 understandable to invite you to participate 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:56.280
 quiz well agreed is it helpful 

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:00.530
 use 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.530
 omega-3 fatty acids with depression and 

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:05.760
 it really is not a trace 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.450
 show that people who suffer 

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.640
 depressed 

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:10.740
 introduction to the diet of omega-3 fatty acids 

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.360
 helps to reduce depressive 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:14.420
 symptoms people start to feel 

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:17.370
 yourself better 

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:21.290
 is it dangerous for omega 3 high 

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:21.290
 temperatures for example work or hot and 

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:25.710
 it really is true 

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.690
 high temperature 

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:29.160
 oxidation of polyunsaturated occurs 

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:31.590
 fatty acids 

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.240
 toxic oxidation products are formed 

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:35.640
 which is dangerous to human 

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:38.550
 therefore not in flaxseed oil 

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:39.270
 you shouldn't cook on fish oil 

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.400
 whether to use 

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:43.560
 omega-3 fatty acids to speed up 

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:48.540
 recovery after exercise 

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:51.330
 yeah well i hope you all understood 

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:55.310
 omega-3 fatty acids and you too 

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:55.310
 there was a heading chemistry body see you tomorrow
