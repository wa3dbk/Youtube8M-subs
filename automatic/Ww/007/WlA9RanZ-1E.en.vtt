00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.069
 images 

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:09.730
 from the sea horizon the boat near 

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:12.360
 the boats keeping the due security 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:15.420
 in case you have to take 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.730
 prevention but really you do not know 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.039
 if someone saw something because it was very mild 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.610
 let's see it again if you can zoom in 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:28.030
 that in addition and can see iván aybar 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:30.280
 I see the white thing yes I already white it if 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:33.940
 we could go back 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:37.030
 and if the graphics boys of 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:40.090
 found can make us a round 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.700
 for or a little arrow that can guide us 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.830
 visually I'm going to thank you for 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.020
 in this way the viewer can before 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:50.050
 the fact of the horizon can identify 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:54.370
 immediately where where it started to fall 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:56.470
 the aircraft establish that it is a is a 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.540
 video amateur and we can see that it has 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.790
 It has been taken from one of the buildings 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.980
 which is opposite the Malecón de Santo 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.170
 Sunday the maneuver that was intended is 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.600
 perform this aircraft is the known 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.050
 squad to be were three aircraft already 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.369
 two had made him and this last one 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.520
 unfortunately he could not complete 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:17.920
 explained more the preview that can be seen 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.580
 when the plane falls and enters the part 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.750
 in front the last thing that can 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.850
 can enter the sea 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.950
 it's the plane's tail and that's why you can 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.580
 appreciate even the fulana matrix and 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.130
 we repeat is the air force matriculation 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.490
 Dominican 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.679
 1807 and we've seen that the tier whenever 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.570
 we are seeing the image now we are going to 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:43.329
 let's repeat it again francisco 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.539
 to be able to visualize good there we already see 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:48.280
 a photograph and there it goes is the white 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.090
 minella and the little arrow and it comes as it goes 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.000
 falling down 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.640
 you see that that was taken from if the 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.759
 mouse and there we see with the mouse we see 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.039
 as it is falling that was taken from one 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:04.539
 of the apartments that are in front of the 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:06.789
 boardwalk unfortunately and so already and 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:10.560
 we see the photo of the wing in the part 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:15.390
 back of the unit that rushed the 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.390
 1807 the Dominican air force
