00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.700
 Hi, I'm Paola Soto and today we'll see the 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.390
 answer to the question we asked 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.160
 in the video of the key number 1 if not 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.560
 have you seen the video of the key 1 you 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.160
 I invite you to see it so you can 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.280
 follow key sequence number 2 well 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.760
 how do I avoid separation with 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:29.609
 the divine matrix all in our world 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.239
 is connected with everything else what 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.859
 This means that decades 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.769
 scientists are telling us that 

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:40.969
 we are all connected however its 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:44.129
 approach was focused on the 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:47.519
 dependence with respect to some kind of 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.769
 initial condition referring 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:52.260
 directly to the effect theory 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:55.409
 butterfly in which he tells us that 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.710
 anything that happens here will have a 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:01:00.829
 effect there 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.629
 this theory was not easy to check the in 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.380
 our lives since we were just arriving 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.750
 to feel its effect the new science has 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.060
 could get more thoroughly with these 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.759
 affirmations sustained in the past 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.100
 besides confirming the connection that 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:19.430
 we have with all things have 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.700
 demonstrated that that connection exists to 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:25.490
 cause of ourselves 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.640
 what does this mean that the connections 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.429
 that we create allow us to have an advantage 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.610
 when it comes to how we will go in the 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:37.219
 life so much at work in love in 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.210
 health and in general compliance 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:42.950
 of our dreams and our goals 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:47.000
 we are an integral part of what 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.159
 we experience day after day the good is 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.250
 we can use these connections 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:55.909
 consciously to open the doors 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:59.000
 of the infinite possibilities said in 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.459
 other words we can use the same 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.729
 power that drives the entire universe to 

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:07.759
 our favor however because of the 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:11.000
 separation that we created we did not achieve 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.970
 access to this great power which 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.150
 he is completely asleep and 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.980
 we can only connect with it when 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.120
 let's wake up 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.810
 surely at this moment you are 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.819
 asking what I do to wake up this 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.739
 huge power and use it 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:34.260
 consciously the answer is simple and 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:37.530
 you must change the vision that 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.709
 you have the world only small 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.569
 changes in the way of seeing things 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:45.239
 would be enough for you to start 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.879
 use this power even for 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:51.239
 solve the most complicated problems 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:54.150
 what do you have then come on us 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:57.750
 the next question how do I change the 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.609
 vision that I have of the world as our 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.609
 universe is infinite and we can not 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:06.430
 encompass everything at once we will start 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:09.430
 this change from within 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.489
 For example, if you used to believe that your 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:16.000
 thoughts do not influence your environment and 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:19.239
 in the universe today you will have to think and 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.540
 assume that if they have an effect and that you can 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:25.239
 consciously create so from today in 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.450
 later start to take care of what 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:30.640
 we are creating for ourselves and for 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.950
 that surround us 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.170
 if you're continually complaining about 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.600
 everything that I do not have money that I am 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.450
 wasting time or I will not get to 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.840
 the time you should change that kind of 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.250
 creation for something more productive 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:49.390
 remember that your thoughts are being 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:52.030
 creating at every moment and step 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:56.390
 I remember a saying that says that to 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:58.880
 that you resist persists 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:02.990
 be aware that you are an integral part 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:07.910
 active and creative in the universe you are 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:11.810
 part of him and he is part of you now 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:14.630
 I have another question for you how can we 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.269
 learn to use the strength of one's own 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.639
 universe 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.849
 We'll see the answer in the video 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:25.030
 the key number 3 which tells us how 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:27.580
 do we see in the key No. 3 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:32.009
 I speak to you paola soto and I say goodbye to you 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.009
 with a big hug until soon
