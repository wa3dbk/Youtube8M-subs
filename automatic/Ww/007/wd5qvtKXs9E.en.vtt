00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.279
 hello everyone with you again phoenix and 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.170
 today i would like to talk about 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.269
 new update alt button changes 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.790
 first I would like to show you that 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.730
 when the opponent measures what we can push 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.480
 alt on the opponent and it shows how much 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.279
 left until rebirth with you for example 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.020
 if your allies don't know where it is 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.519
 see of course you can 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:31.140
 suggest further here and so you can 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.550
 show that there is a strengthening of the structure 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.210
 that it can be used 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.430
 and if you press alt alt carl and and again 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.020
 as there is something you tell your 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.059
 teammates so that they have not yet 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.850
 used 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.379
 fortification in the building further when we 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.410
 now click on abilities 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.270
 shows the level of our pumping 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.449
 abilities important to know how they are 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.960
 are called because will show 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.780
 its allies that is not about quality but 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.960
 they will not know how any with files 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.140
 so study 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:12.210
 the name is what I didn't like 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:14.729
 what else have they fixed this 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.740
 when we have active gear we 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.960
 for example, click on blink dagger that 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.810
 We are ready for them to act and you can 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.500
 fly one with some arrows 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.630
 put and therefore you cannot say 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:34.460
 to your allies that you fly and so 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:38.880
 further, but here is what we have to extinguished 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:41.759
 our captivates and remains peeling 1 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.220
 second it is of course we can show on 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:50.549
 what we want to fly we show not 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:52.040
 can here and so, too, as a drawback 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.630
 performance seems 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:59.329
 then we may now have to buff his 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.920
 show sideways or additive which 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:03.689
 there is here that is for example if your 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.579
 team have abbadona you could you 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.100

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:11.209

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.900

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.330

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.190

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.880

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.680

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.569
