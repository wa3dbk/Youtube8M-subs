00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
second world oh i station so a minecart

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.340 
second world oh i station so a minecart
and<00:00:35.949> a<00:00:35.980> station<00:00:36.580> a<00:00:36.699> minecart<00:00:37.150> station<00:00:37.360> now<00:00:37.840> try

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
and a station a minecart station now try

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.400 
and a station a minecart station now try
guessing<00:00:38.500> what<00:00:38.800> it<00:00:38.920> is<00:00:39.010> I<00:00:39.280> bet<00:00:40.030> you<00:00:40.210> that<00:00:40.410> yeah

sure it's it's a true Madrid or it works
with<00:00:43.989> a<00:00:44.019> proton<00:00:44.320> and<00:00:44.650> it's<00:00:44.979> pretty<00:00:45.250> fast<00:00:45.460> and

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
with a proton and it's pretty fast and

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.250 
with a proton and it's pretty fast and
no<00:00:46.000> actually<00:00:46.390> it's<00:00:46.510> a<00:00:46.629> it's<00:00:46.900> a<00:00:46.989> minecart

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
no actually it's a it's a minecart

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.320 
no actually it's a it's a minecart
station<00:00:47.409> but<00:00:48.159> don't<00:00:48.460> worry<00:00:48.549> though<00:00:48.760> even<00:00:49.089> with

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:49.330 
station but don't worry though even with

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.570 
station but don't worry though even with
the<00:00:49.570> tips<00:00:50.049> I<00:00:50.199> gave<00:00:50.260> you<00:00:50.500> the<00:00:50.769> two<00:00:51.040> words<00:00:51.220> I<00:00:51.370> gave

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.670 
the tips I gave you the two words I gave
you<00:00:51.729> it<00:00:52.299> was<00:00:52.510> very<00:00:52.809> difficult<00:00:53.049> to<00:00:53.290> find<00:00:53.559> out

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
you it was very difficult to find out

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.270 
you it was very difficult to find out
what<00:00:53.920> it<00:00:54.070> was

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
what it was

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.310 
what it was
mostly<00:00:55.030> because<00:00:55.210> I<00:00:55.510> haven't<00:00:55.690> been<00:00:55.989> doing<00:00:56.140> a

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
mostly because I haven't been doing a

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.420 
mostly because I haven't been doing a
lot<00:00:56.470> of<00:00:56.500> minecart<00:00:57.070> station<00:00:57.159> slightly<00:00:59.430> but

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
lot of minecart station slightly but

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.670 
lot of minecart station slightly but
actually<00:01:00.970> this<00:01:01.089> one<00:01:01.330> is<00:01:01.479> an<00:01:01.960> sign<00:01:02.229> a<00:01:02.260> showcase

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
actually this one is an sign a showcase

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.100 
actually this one is an sign a showcase
on<00:01:02.949> my<00:01:03.190> previous<00:01:03.339> video<00:01:03.659> and<00:01:04.659> because<00:01:04.960> of<00:01:04.989> that

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
on my previous video and because of that

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.710 
on my previous video and because of that
I'm<00:01:05.379> not<00:01:05.530> going<00:01:06.040> to<00:01:06.159> talk<00:01:06.520> much<00:01:06.760> about<00:01:07.000> it<00:01:07.180> on

description but also in the end of that

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.360 
description but also in the end of that
video<00:01:16.330> I<00:01:16.630> said<00:01:17.350> I<00:01:17.380> was<00:01:17.650> going<00:01:17.830> to<00:01:17.980> make<00:01:18.160> an

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
video I said I was going to make an

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.340 
video I said I was going to make an
offensive<00:01:18.670> version<00:01:19.150> of<00:01:19.300> this<00:01:19.570> station<00:01:19.990> and

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
offensive version of this station and

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.190 
offensive version of this station and
now<00:01:21.070> right<00:01:21.880> now<00:01:22.000> I'm<00:01:22.210> going<00:01:22.360> to<00:01:22.540> showcase<00:01:23.020> the

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
now right now I'm going to showcase the

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.470 
now right now I'm going to showcase the
if<00:01:23.320> answer<00:01:23.590> version<00:01:23.920> and<00:01:24.460> then<00:01:24.880> what<00:01:25.060> is<00:01:25.240> the

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.480 
if answer version and then what is the

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.390 
if answer version and then what is the
fancier<00:01:25.840> version<00:01:26.230> as<00:01:26.380> you<00:01:26.800> can<00:01:26.890> see<00:01:27.040> it's<00:01:27.310> a

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
fancier version as you can see it's a

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.460 
fancier version as you can see it's a
lot<00:01:27.580> different<00:01:27.700> from<00:01:28.000> the<00:01:28.570> previous<00:01:28.780> design<00:01:29.080> I

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
lot different from the previous design I

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.490 
lot different from the previous design I
shot<00:01:29.860> and<00:01:30.160> with<00:01:30.940> this<00:01:31.120> design<00:01:31.450> you<00:01:31.660> can<00:01:32.290> have<00:01:32.470> a

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
shot and with this design you can have a

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.010 
shot and with this design you can have a
very<00:01:32.860> long<00:01:33.070> track<00:01:33.400> with<00:01:33.970> many<00:01:34.390> stops<00:01:34.720> in<00:01:34.900> the

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
very long track with many stops in the

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.470 
very long track with many stops in the
middle<00:01:35.050> and<00:01:35.590> if<00:01:35.980> you<00:01:36.130> want<00:01:36.310> to<00:01:36.430> be<00:01:36.550> afk<00:01:37.150> from

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 
middle and if you want to be afk from

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.750 
middle and if you want to be afk from
the<00:01:37.690> beginning<00:01:38.020> to<00:01:38.350> the<00:01:38.380> end<00:01:38.530> you<00:01:39.190> can<00:01:39.220> do<00:01:39.610> that

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
the beginning to the end you can do that

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.550 
the beginning to the end you can do that
just<00:01:40.030> fine<00:01:40.240> because<00:01:40.480> every<00:01:40.960> time<00:01:41.110> you<00:01:41.320> pans

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
just fine because every time you pans

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.890 
just fine because every time you pans
behind<00:01:41.950> the<00:01:42.040> station<00:01:42.250> and<00:01:42.640> if<00:01:43.360> you<00:01:43.540> don't<00:01:43.750> do

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
behind the station and if you don't do

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.690 
behind the station and if you don't do
anything<00:01:44.140> it's<00:01:44.500> going<00:01:44.740> to<00:01:44.920> make<00:01:45.100> you<00:01:45.250> continue

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
anything it's going to make you continue

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.480 
anything it's going to make you continue
coming<00:01:45.880> forwards<00:01:46.300> if<00:01:46.630> you<00:01:46.840> wait<00:01:47.080> a<00:01:47.110> while<00:01:47.490> just

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
coming forwards if you wait a while just

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.580 
coming forwards if you wait a while just
like<00:01:48.700> that<00:01:48.909> now<00:01:49.659> if<00:01:49.900> you<00:01:50.050> actually<00:01:50.350> want<00:01:50.500> to

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
like that now if you actually want to

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.410 
like that now if you actually want to
stop<00:01:50.890> at<00:01:51.130> the<00:01:51.340> station<00:01:51.730> you<00:01:51.909> just<00:01:52.150> have<00:01:52.270> to

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
stop at the station you just have to

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.060 
stop at the station you just have to
press<00:01:52.750> this<00:01:52.900> middle<00:01:53.260> button<00:01:53.440> right<00:01:53.740> here<00:01:53.770> and

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
press this middle button right here and

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.550 
press this middle button right here and
let's<00:01:54.760> can<00:01:54.909> see<00:01:55.030> it's<00:01:55.240> not<00:01:55.390> going<00:01:55.450> to<00:01:55.870> push<00:01:56.440> the

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
let's can see it's not going to push the

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.590 
let's can see it's not going to push the
minecart<00:01:56.979> or<00:01:57.220> anything<00:01:57.580> like<00:01:57.820> that<00:01:57.880> because

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
minecart or anything like that because

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.420 
minecart or anything like that because
you<00:01:58.900> can<00:01:59.050> because<00:01:59.710> it's<00:01:59.890> going<00:02:00.040> to<00:02:00.130> stop<00:02:00.400> the

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
you can because it's going to stop the

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.460 
you can because it's going to stop the
minecart<00:02:00.940> and<00:02:01.120> with<00:02:01.810> that<00:02:01.930> you<00:02:02.110> can<00:02:02.290> do

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
minecart and with that you can do

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.740 
minecart and with that you can do
whatever<00:02:02.770> you<00:02:03.040> want<00:02:03.250> on<00:02:03.400> the<00:02:03.670> area<00:02:03.940> and<00:02:04.210> once

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
whatever you want on the area and once

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.360 
whatever you want on the area and once
you're<00:02:04.870> back<00:02:05.050> you<00:02:05.320> can<00:02:05.500> just<00:02:05.530> put<00:02:05.920> a<00:02:05.950> minecart

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
you're back you can just put a minecart

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.279 
you're back you can just put a minecart
and<00:02:06.549> press<00:02:06.970> one<00:02:07.210> of<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.450> buttons<00:02:07.479> to<00:02:08.080> go

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
and press one of the buttons to go

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.160 
and press one of the buttons to go
through<00:02:08.890> either<00:02:09.159> direction<00:02:09.810> well<00:02:10.810> yeah<00:02:11.140> I

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
through either direction well yeah I

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.780 
through either direction well yeah I
think<00:02:11.500> that's<00:02:11.680> basically<00:02:11.799> for<00:02:12.069> the<00:02:12.610> showcase

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
think that's basically for the showcase

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.880 
think that's basically for the showcase
so<00:02:13.269> now<00:02:13.659> I<00:02:13.690> guess<00:02:14.080> we<00:02:14.230> can<00:02:14.379> go<00:02:14.530> with<00:02:14.799> the

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
so now I guess we can go with the

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.270 
so now I guess we can go with the
Redstone<00:02:15.250> shall<00:02:15.519> we<00:02:16.440> so<00:02:17.440> here's<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.130> whole

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
Redstone shall we so here's the whole

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.130 
Redstone shall we so here's the whole
Redstone<00:02:18.670> and<00:02:18.850> let's<00:02:19.300> can<00:02:19.420> see<00:02:19.540> it's<00:02:19.660> a<00:02:19.810> very

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
Redstone and let's can see it's a very

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.290 
Redstone and let's can see it's a very
big<00:02:20.410> system<00:02:20.950> and<00:02:21.220> but<00:02:21.940> that's<00:02:22.120> because

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
big system and but that's because

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.160 
big system and but that's because
there's<00:02:22.720> a<00:02:22.780> lot

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
there's a lot

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.050 
there's a lot
things<00:02:23.410> happening<00:02:23.950> for<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.490> system<00:02:24.849> to<00:02:25.030> work

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
things happening for the system to work

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.440 
things happening for the system to work
now<00:02:25.840> as<00:02:26.500> you<00:02:26.680> can<00:02:26.860> notice<00:02:27.280> there's<00:02:27.730> a<00:02:27.819> Enderman

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
now as you can notice there's a Enderman

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.870 
now as you can notice there's a Enderman
right<00:02:28.810> there<00:02:28.989> and<00:02:29.260> that's<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.099> key<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.400> making

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
right there and that's the key to making

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.940 
right there and that's the key to making
the<00:02:31.239> system<00:02:31.390> work<00:02:31.569> because<00:02:32.380> every<00:02:32.590> time<00:02:32.770> you

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
the system work because every time you

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.800 
the system work because every time you
press<00:02:33.160> a<00:02:33.190> button<00:02:33.310> or<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:34.239> minecart<00:02:34.599> goes

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
press a button or the minecart goes

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.110 
press a button or the minecart goes
through<00:02:35.170> pressure<00:02:35.739> plates<00:02:36.069> after<00:02:36.250> some<00:02:36.940> while

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
through pressure plates after some while

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.320 
through pressure plates after some while
the<00:02:37.450> Enderman<00:02:38.050> is<00:02:38.230> going<00:02:38.470> to<00:02:38.650> force<00:02:38.920> the

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
the Enderman is going to force the

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.550 
the Enderman is going to force the
minecart<00:02:40.330> through<00:02:40.569> this<00:02:40.810> direction<00:02:41.260> it<00:02:41.440> needs

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
minecart through this direction it needs

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.280 
minecart through this direction it needs
to<00:02:41.800> go<00:02:41.920> so<00:02:42.760> every<00:02:43.090> time<00:02:43.239> it<00:02:43.300> goes<00:02:43.630> behind<00:02:44.020> the

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
to go so every time it goes behind the

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.809 
to go so every time it goes behind the
pressure<00:02:44.500> plate<00:02:44.739> it's<00:02:44.950> going<00:02:45.040> to<00:02:45.310> change<00:02:45.610> the

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
pressure plate it's going to change the

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.900 
pressure plate it's going to change the
direction<00:02:46.000> of<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:47.010> change<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.160> position<00:02:48.730> of

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
direction of the change the position of

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.600 
direction of the change the position of
the<00:02:49.150> Enderman<00:02:49.569> and<00:02:49.810> make<00:02:50.380> the<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:51.220> minecart

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
the Enderman and make the the minecart

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.330 
the Enderman and make the the minecart
go<00:02:51.790> through<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.360> opposite<00:02:52.989> direction<00:02:53.410> let's

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
go through the opposite direction let's

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.870 
go through the opposite direction let's
go<00:02:54.550> see<00:02:54.730> right<00:02:54.880> there<00:02:55.950> but<00:02:56.950> then<00:02:57.100> now<00:02:57.400> when<00:02:57.760> you

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
go see right there but then now when you

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.180 
go see right there but then now when you
want<00:02:58.120> to<00:02:58.450> stop<00:02:58.780> a<00:02:58.810> minecart<00:02:59.230> what<00:02:59.739> is<00:02:59.920> going<00:03:00.130> to

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
want to stop a minecart what is going to

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.990 
want to stop a minecart what is going to
do<00:03:00.370> is<00:03:00.670> just<00:03:01.620> don't<00:03:02.620> do<00:03:02.739> anything<00:03:03.010> is<00:03:03.340> going<00:03:03.790> to

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
do is just don't do anything is going to

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.570 
do is just don't do anything is going to
prevent<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:04.959> end<00:03:05.110> men<00:03:05.350> from<00:03:05.590> coming<00:03:05.920> up<00:03:06.100> and

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
prevent the end men from coming up and

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.680 
prevent the end men from coming up and
what<00:03:07.330> what<00:03:07.750> also<00:03:08.049> you<00:03:08.290> can<00:03:08.470> do<00:03:08.650> is<00:03:08.860> if<00:03:09.489> you<00:03:09.730> if

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
what what also you can do is if you if

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.830 
what what also you can do is if you if
the<00:03:10.900> minecarts<00:03:11.410> is<00:03:12.030> if<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.180> minecart<00:03:13.600> is

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
the minecarts is if the minecart is

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.020 
the minecarts is if the minecart is
coming<00:03:14.410> from<00:03:14.620> that<00:03:14.890> direction<00:03:15.040> you<00:03:15.670> can<00:03:15.880> also

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
coming from that direction you can also

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.059 
coming from that direction you can also
make<00:03:16.330> it<00:03:16.360> go<00:03:16.780> back<00:03:16.989> to<00:03:17.019> that<00:03:17.350> direction<00:03:17.680> by

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
make it go back to that direction by

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.699 
make it go back to that direction by
pressing<00:03:18.519> this<00:03:18.640> button<00:03:18.700> and<00:03:19.180> it<00:03:19.810> was<00:03:20.170> work

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
pressing this button and it was work

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.699 
pressing this button and it was work
just<00:03:20.950> fine<00:03:21.130> which<00:03:21.850> is<00:03:21.880> pretty<00:03:22.180> cool<00:03:22.330> and<00:03:22.709> it's

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
just fine which is pretty cool and it's

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.670 
just fine which is pretty cool and it's
a<00:03:23.830> very<00:03:24.040> nice<00:03:24.160> system<00:03:24.340> in<00:03:24.670> my<00:03:24.790> opinion<00:03:25.260> now<00:03:26.260> I

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
a very nice system in my opinion now I

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.670 
a very nice system in my opinion now I
would<00:03:26.890> like<00:03:27.010> to<00:03:27.069> mention<00:03:27.400> some<00:03:28.299> people<00:03:28.680> before

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
would like to mention some people before

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.410 
would like to mention some people before
I'm<00:03:29.739> ending<00:03:30.100> this<00:03:30.250> video<00:03:30.519> I<00:03:30.700> would<00:03:30.940> like<00:03:31.150> to

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
I'm ending this video I would like to

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.620 
I'm ending this video I would like to
mention<00:03:32.400> Molly<00:03:33.400> creeper<00:03:33.820> because<00:03:34.209> I<00:03:34.359> got<00:03:34.510> the

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
mention Molly creeper because I got the

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.020 
mention Molly creeper because I got the
idea<00:03:34.900> of<00:03:35.170> making<00:03:35.410> this<00:03:35.739> system<00:03:35.920> from<00:03:36.609> a<00:03:36.640> very

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
idea of making this system from a very

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.210 
idea of making this system from a very
nice<00:03:37.180> minecart<00:03:37.690> station<00:03:37.810> he<00:03:38.200> made<00:03:38.410> I<00:03:38.620> think

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
nice minecart station he made I think

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.220 
nice minecart station he made I think
the<00:03:39.489> name<00:03:39.700> was<00:03:39.940> magical<00:03:40.600> minecart<00:03:41.109> station
