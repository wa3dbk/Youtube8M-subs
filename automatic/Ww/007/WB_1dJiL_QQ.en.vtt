bad a problem there as you see I'm

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:05.930 
bad a problem there as you see I'm
taking<00:00:57.840> quite<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.079> bit<00:00:58.289> off<00:00:58.410> right<00:00:58.680> there

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.899 

ok<00:01:06.890> do<00:01:07.890> this

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.270 

okay<00:01:12.920> go

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.430 

it<00:01:16.880> kind<00:01:17.180> of<00:01:17.240> digs<00:01:17.479> in<00:01:17.690> there<00:01:17.900> so<00:01:18.110> I'm<00:01:18.200> going<00:01:18.380> to

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
it kind of digs in there so I'm going to

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.990 
it kind of digs in there so I'm going to
have<00:01:18.530> to<00:01:18.560> kind<00:01:18.799> of<00:01:18.830> come<00:01:19.040> at<00:01:19.159> this<00:01:19.310> this<00:01:19.700> point

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
have to kind of come at this this point

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.450 
have to kind of come at this this point
right<00:01:20.180> here<00:01:20.409> sort<00:01:21.409> of<00:01:21.560> bring<00:01:21.799> that<00:01:21.830> blade<00:01:22.430> down

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
right here sort of bring that blade down

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.990 
right here sort of bring that blade down
like<00:01:22.940> that<00:01:23.500> sometimes<00:01:24.500> easier<00:01:25.040> just<00:01:25.220> to<00:01:25.369> take

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
like that sometimes easier just to take

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.600 
like that sometimes easier just to take
the<00:01:26.150> blade<00:01:26.390> and<00:01:26.659> do<00:01:27.290> this<00:01:27.470> till<00:01:28.280> you<00:01:28.340> get<00:01:28.490> down

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
the blade and do this till you get down

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.810 
the blade and do this till you get down
to<00:01:28.880> thin<00:01:29.180> just<00:01:29.420> to<00:01:29.990> slowly<00:01:30.320> remove<00:01:30.560> it<00:01:33.820> cross

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
to thin just to slowly remove it cross

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.090 
to thin just to slowly remove it cross
grain<00:01:35.060> with<00:01:35.720> it<00:01:35.869> there<00:01:36.350> we<00:01:36.500> go<00:01:36.680> now<00:01:36.920> we're

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
grain with it there we go now we're

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:45.950 
grain with it there we go now we're
starting

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.070 

they<00:01:46.960> see<00:01:47.020> what<00:01:47.320> we're<00:01:47.439> doing<00:01:47.650> see<00:01:48.640> that<00:01:49.080> we're

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
they see what we're doing see that we're

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.200 
they see what we're doing see that we're
blade<00:01:50.350> bringing<00:01:50.830> that<00:01:50.950> blade<00:01:51.280> down<00:01:51.310> to<00:01:51.909> a<00:01:51.939> V

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
blade bringing that blade down to a V

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.020 
blade bringing that blade down to a V
and<00:01:52.390> we're<00:01:52.509> going<00:01:52.630> to<00:01:52.659> bring<00:01:52.810> it<00:01:52.900> down<00:01:53.020> pretty

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
and we're going to bring it down pretty

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.100 
and we're going to bring it down pretty
we're<00:01:55.030> going<00:01:55.149> to<00:01:55.210> bring<00:01:55.330> it<00:01:55.390> down<00:01:55.450> pretty<00:01:55.780> thin

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
we're going to bring it down pretty thin

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:08.520 
we're going to bring it down pretty thin
if<00:01:57.040> we<00:01:57.159> want<00:01:57.369> that<00:01:57.780> okay

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.520 

here<00:02:10.660> suppose<00:02:11.660> if<00:02:11.930> we<00:02:11.959> want<00:02:12.260> to<00:02:12.319> get<00:02:12.470> our

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
here suppose if we want to get our

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.030 
here suppose if we want to get our
thinness<00:02:13.310> of<00:02:13.580> our<00:02:13.840> front<00:02:14.840> of<00:02:14.930> our<00:02:15.050> blade<00:02:15.349> first

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
thinness of our front of our blade first

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.990 
thinness of our front of our blade first
then<00:02:16.849> we<00:02:16.970> can<00:02:17.000> kind<00:02:17.330> of<00:02:17.450> work<00:02:17.690> with<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:19.760> rest

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
then we can kind of work with the rest

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.780 
then we can kind of work with the rest
of<00:02:20.209> it<00:02:20.360> to<00:02:20.930> thin<00:02:21.170> it<00:02:21.200> down<00:02:21.380> we<00:02:22.370> want<00:02:22.610> to<00:02:22.700> get

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
of it to thin it down we want to get

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
of it to thin it down we want to get
this<00:02:26.230> say<00:02:27.489> who<00:02:28.489> are<00:02:28.610> working<00:02:28.790> at<00:02:29.000> that<00:02:29.030> that

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
bit thinner but it's going to be kind of

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.380 
bit thinner but it's going to be kind of
a<00:04:44.100> v-shape<00:04:44.610> when<00:04:45.270> you<00:04:45.360> get<00:04:45.510> through<00:04:45.750> with<00:04:45.870> it

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
a v-shape when you get through with it

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:54.590 
a v-shape when you get through with it
you<00:04:48.390> see<00:04:52.340> ya<00:04:53.340> when<00:04:53.910> you<00:04:54.000> get<00:04:54.120> down<00:04:54.240> close<00:04:54.570> to

or anything like that I'm gonna come
down<00:05:01.830> a<00:05:01.860> little<00:05:01.950> bit<00:05:02.130> more<00:05:02.430> with<00:05:02.610> the<00:05:02.700> handle

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
down a little bit more with the handle

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.450 
down a little bit more with the handle
you<00:05:03.570> see<00:05:03.780> by<00:05:04.320> bringing<00:05:04.680> the<00:05:04.770> blade<00:05:05.010> down<00:05:05.220> it

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
you see by bringing the blade down it

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.660 
you see by bringing the blade down it
shows<00:05:05.730> me<00:05:06.620> that<00:05:07.620> maybe<00:05:07.920> the<00:05:08.100> handle<00:05:08.400> needs<00:05:08.550> to

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:08.670 
shows me that maybe the handle needs to

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.310 
shows me that maybe the handle needs to
come<00:05:08.850> down<00:05:08.880> just<00:05:09.240> a<00:05:09.270> little<00:05:09.450> more<00:05:09.690> a<00:05:10.020> little
