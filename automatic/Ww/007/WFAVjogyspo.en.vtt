 like brushes hello all welcome to this new and first tutorials of the 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.459
 that I will explain how to put textures in the emulator project 64 1 points 7 for 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:13.459
 the game super smash bros 64 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:25.429
 first of all you should download the files of my post in tahrir 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:28.429
 I leave it in the description 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.369
 once downloaded your files 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.910
 they will appear a folder and an installer to you will come out only 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.060
 a folder 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.520
 then they will have done 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.579
 and as you will see is one of those who will do the installation of the emulator 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.210
 well here is already installing 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.000
 but I sang the law because I already have it and this is also talent so 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 I am 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.470
 after having them 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.020
 they go to the folder where they installed it, which by default is faith 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.020
 own program files 64 1 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.150
 as you will see here a folder appears that says soft textures that is the 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.260
 folder where 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
 in the textures for the game 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.240
 after that 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.210
 you will copy the textures folder in the textures load folder 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.939
 of the emulator so the emulator will load the textures automatically 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.080
 I do not do it because I already have other different textures 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.970
 then we are going to open the emulator 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.639
 then we go to options 

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:11.089
 configuration 

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:15.169
 let's go to the directory tab if we go down to where it says directory 

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:19.369
 textures I wanted lecce hands option 2 which is for the emulator to recognize the 

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:22.369
 textures folder 

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:26.379
 forget the koons directory 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.869
 they look for the folder where they have saved the game and they give it to affect 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:40.109
 let's open the game 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:51.689
 it's going a little slow for what I'm recording 

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:59.859
 good I close wounds 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:03.819
 because he's too slow to start playing but then I'll make a video to 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.819
 that do not say that in any pc 

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:15.830
 this has not been all I hope you have served the tutorial 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.830
 is the first one I do so they notify both 

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:20.790
 they help me improve 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.819
 Greetings and do not forget to comment
