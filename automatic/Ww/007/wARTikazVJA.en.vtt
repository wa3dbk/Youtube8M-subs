00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.570 

I<00:00:00.240> don't<00:00:01.110> think<00:00:01.199> Philemon<00:00:01.859> is<00:00:02.010> one<00:00:02.340> of<00:00:02.490> the

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
I don't think Philemon is one of the

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.220 
I don't think Philemon is one of the
most<00:00:02.730> theologically<00:00:03.420> dense<00:00:03.630> books<00:00:03.960> in<00:00:04.140> the

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
most theologically dense books in the

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.880 
most theologically dense books in the
New<00:00:04.350> Testament<00:00:05.000> it's<00:00:06.000> it's<00:00:06.600> so<00:00:07.259> short<00:00:07.560> and

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
New Testament it's it's so short and

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.220 
New Testament it's it's so short and
it's<00:00:08.099> so<00:00:08.280> brief<00:00:08.549> that<00:00:08.849> it<00:00:09.480> really<00:00:09.809> it<00:00:10.049> gets

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
it's so brief that it really it gets

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.799 
it's so brief that it really it gets
ignored<00:00:10.679> I<00:00:10.919> think

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:13.809 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:16.199 

so<00:00:14.620> this<00:00:14.799> is<00:00:15.040> the<00:00:15.219> letter<00:00:15.429> Paul<00:00:15.730> to<00:00:15.910> Philemon

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:16.209 
so this is the letter Paul to Philemon

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.470 
so this is the letter Paul to Philemon
