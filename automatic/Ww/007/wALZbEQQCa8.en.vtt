00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.340

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:28.880
 renew the cage to throw them 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.189
 birds the little balls in for the little tree 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.390
 we have it out there I do not know where it was 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.860
 because it's for a production that 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.129
 we have to do but also the ones in a 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.199
 minute by clock and decorate our 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:42.100
 food at home drink the tea that 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:45.649
 we have and you have a pot that swims 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.329
 well let's renovate and now we're going to 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.039
 renew for Christmas we will do everything 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:50.500
 a floral arrangement 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:52.660
 this is him 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.180
 the base of the base on which they are going to 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.739
 put all the flowers afterwards and I 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.550
 that I worked was all in green ranges 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:04.989
 gold plated copper bronze and silver and 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:07.660
 the whole gamut of the whole range like that was 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.610
 well happy and also vermilion 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.750
 so use the full range paint 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:16.300
 directly on the wood this is a 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.640
 book grain wooden container 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:22.060
 easy but hand -held wooden pine 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.830
 pine wood that already came with a 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.869
 base I did not give it to him but it was coming 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.300
 with the base they also buy from 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.640
 raw pine can give you a base one 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.520
 white acrylic base a base 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.960
 white acrylic or same live that you 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.030
 I say learn I do not go straight with 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.340
 black or not this has a base of 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.990
 director is going to fatten him in this case 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.750
 it's better to give it a base if we want it 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.789
 it is noticeable the vein of the pine we do not give 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.399
 nothing good if we do not directly give it 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.729
 a base and we paint because you see that 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.990
 with base and everything absorbs enough 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.270
 quickly paint it and what I'm going to 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.580
 do now is spray it a little bit 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.560
 Golden 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.010
 and then I put a little bit of copper 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.010
 as well 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:09.410
 to play a little game and with a cloth 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.569
 I'm going to see her, it's clear 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.020
 I want it to be a little more marked 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.970
 dew a little more very well and so you 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.170
 we are assembling as the vein with a 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.930
 cloth 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.250
 and that's how you get everything you have is 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.310
 that you have to do it in a little place 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.530
 ventilated because with this we spray a lot 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.170
 painting is not like other jobs more 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:37.580
 young children we do that we work 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:39.709
 but this remains like this and all this remains 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.720
 we are going to leave a costadito as a 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.180
 finished I say no the spray was always 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.280
 for tornado and what we're going to do is 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.800
 painting the flowers for that increases all 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.690
 the dried flowers of those dried flowers 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.480
 sure they are everywhere 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.769
 this is so but then pulls me 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.140
 I do not have to walk with the rod 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.180
 all sides but directly this 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.519
 color you're going to paint me that other red this 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.260
 red because we're going to do all the 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.750
 forward presentation with flowers 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.680
 red and then all the background that is in 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.900
 gold plated copper then this flower 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.630
 will go like that red but like this one is super 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.030
 quick easy I'm thinking if you have 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.220
 some plastic thing also to flower 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.799
 of plastic also painted so 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.540
 dry part very fast because the doctor 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.849
 a lot of paint and then 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.680
 what I did was give him a little bit of him 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:33.349
 but a detail quoted nothing else like that but 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.760
 copper or bronze the color that the shelter 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:36.769
 Golden can also be given a 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.450
 little bit of silver yes yes I have the 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.519
 Christmas tree 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.200
 the tree of life can be painted 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.750
 also and then what you can 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.090
 do do you can paint with green and 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.430
 as I did just apply a little bit 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.470
 of white then it looks like salt 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.180
 minced I can renew my little tree 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.280
 forever generator to renew the 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.810
 tree is under its crisis and power 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.060
 renew the tree you can paint 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.900
 directly as is the little tree 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.220
 how am I going to do with this you pass but 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.769
 to see in this case what I'm going through 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.490
 green but if not then you can go 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.820
 Playing 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:14.300
 with other colors for example here 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.310
 we have another color 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.690
 but we're going through it, so we're going 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:22.670
 turning does not have to paint sheet by sheet 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.830
 or anything like that then we go like this 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.950
 and I'm playing is with a little silver 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.620
 as well 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:32.110
 what it has as I told you before they go 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.910
 to spray a lot more paint then to 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:40.510
 try to do it in a ventilated place 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:42.100
 clear so the smell goes a little and we 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.990
 we stain so much because he sees that it stains 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.990
 a little more than what stains more 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.330
 usually because these are rods 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.190
 very long because later when he is in 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.440
 the vase has to stand out 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.300
 from the vase then the rods are 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.240
 rather long and we are painting everything 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:01.480
 well and everything is renewed and 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:05.020
 It's all an eye flower arrangement 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.840
 for Christmas the question about all kinds 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:14.740
 of social surface I take that you can 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:19.830
 move with the spray to the time where 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:23.050
 distinct the world of fibrofácil of 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:25.600
 pine wood or any other kind of 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:35.020
 wood also metal metal 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:38.130
 sometimes the return we painted the ideas in 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.130
 spray paint spray 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:45.690
 that really encourage you to renew in a 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.690
 ratito means 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.630
 paint kuwait synthetic enamel in 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:57.940
 spray for indoor and outdoor more than 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:06:00.110
 40 glossy matt satin colors 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.900
 Metallized and fluorine the best 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:06.920
 results in any kind of 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:08.960
 surface paint kuwait dot com.ar and 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.460
 we are not saying goodbye to the program 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.890

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.410
 next but we also give you all the 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:18.260
