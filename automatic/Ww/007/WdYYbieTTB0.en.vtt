this<00:00:01.000> is<00:00:01.150> the<00:00:01.209> real<00:00:01.359> thrill<00:00:01.569> for<00:00:01.719> us<00:00:01.810> today

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:01.959 
this is the real thrill for us today

00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:03.690 
this is the real thrill for us today
because<00:00:02.200> a<00:00:02.380> year<00:00:02.650> ago<00:00:02.920> we<00:00:03.340> launched<00:00:03.610> this

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:03.700 
because a year ago we launched this

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.499 
because a year ago we launched this
project<00:00:04.180> with<00:00:04.870> the<00:00:05.229> concept<00:00:06.039> of<00:00:06.220> a<00:00:06.669> thousand

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:07.509 
project with the concept of a thousand

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:09.450 
project with the concept of a thousand
dollar<00:00:07.660> car<00:00:08.050> inspiring<00:00:08.799> kids<00:00:09.070> but<00:00:09.250> we<00:00:09.309> had<00:00:09.429> a

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:09.460 
dollar car inspiring kids but we had a

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.539 
dollar car inspiring kids but we had a
lot<00:00:09.700> of<00:00:09.820> pieces<00:00:10.000> missing<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:11.440> car<00:00:11.710> last<00:00:12.219> year

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:12.549 
lot of pieces missing the car last year

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:14.400 
lot of pieces missing the car last year
we've<00:00:13.059> had<00:00:13.269> a<00:00:13.299> concept<00:00:13.870> that<00:00:13.990> the<00:00:14.110> research

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:14.410 
we've had a concept that the research

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.340 
we've had a concept that the research
said<00:00:15.150> could<00:00:16.150> do<00:00:16.570> a<00:00:16.600> thousand<00:00:17.019> miles<00:00:17.140> an<00:00:17.260> hour

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:17.350 
said could do a thousand miles an hour

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.009 
said could do a thousand miles an hour
it<00:00:17.650> was<00:00:17.890> technically<00:00:18.310> possible<00:00:18.810> in<00:00:19.810> the<00:00:19.930> last

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:20.019 
it was technically possible in the last

it was technically possible in the last
year<00:00:20.289> thirteen<00:00:20.650> months<00:00:20.920> we<00:00:21.070> moved<00:00:21.250> from<00:00:21.430> could

through<00:00:59.739> the<00:00:59.829> speed<00:01:00.010> range<00:01:00.190> we<00:01:01.030> know<00:01:01.359> that<00:01:01.690> the

through the speed range we know that the

through the speed range we know that the

and once we do it'll be safe to do that
I<00:01:04.960> suspect<00:01:05.650> that<00:01:05.740> driving<00:01:06.160> this<00:01:06.250> car<00:01:06.490> is<00:01:06.640> going

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
I suspect that driving this car is going

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.610 
I suspect that driving this car is going
to<00:01:06.910> be<00:01:07.000> something<00:01:07.360> of<00:01:07.600> an<00:01:07.690> extreme<00:01:08.020> experience

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620 
to be something of an extreme experience

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.040 
to be something of an extreme experience
the<00:01:09.280> sheer<00:01:09.550> physical<00:01:09.820> demands<00:01:10.330> of<00:01:10.750> actually

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
the sheer physical demands of actually

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.870 
the sheer physical demands of actually
sitting<00:01:11.320> just<00:01:11.980> underneath<00:01:12.250> the<00:01:12.460> jetting

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
sitting just underneath the jetting

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.210 
sitting just underneath the jetting
taper<00:01:13.120> it<00:01:13.270> would<00:01:13.360> be<00:01:13.450> very<00:01:13.630> very<00:01:14.170> noisy<00:01:14.410> very

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
taper it would be very very noisy very

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.440 
taper it would be very very noisy very
small<00:01:15.370> cockpit<00:01:15.730> so<00:01:15.790> it's<00:01:15.880> gonna<00:01:15.970> be<00:01:16.060> very<00:01:16.240> hot

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
small cockpit so it's gonna be very hot

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.090 
small cockpit so it's gonna be very hot
and<00:01:16.660> of<00:01:16.720> course<00:01:16.900> we're<00:01:17.260> amplifying<00:01:18.010> that

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
and of course we're amplifying that

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.280 
and of course we're amplifying that
effect<00:01:18.400> by<00:01:18.490> taking<00:01:18.760> it<00:01:18.820> to<00:01:18.850> a<00:01:18.940> desert<00:01:19.120> and<00:01:19.450> then

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
effect by taking it to a desert and then

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.250 
effect by taking it to a desert and then
the<00:01:20.470> sheer<00:01:20.710> physical<00:01:21.010> g-loads<00:01:21.850> of

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
the sheer physical g-loads of

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.570 
the sheer physical g-loads of
accelerating<00:01:23.260> at<00:01:23.440> up<00:01:23.770> to<00:01:23.890> two<00:01:24.040> and<00:01:24.070> a<00:01:24.160> half<00:01:24.310> G

accelerating at up to two and a half G

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.550 
accelerating at up to two and a half G
so<00:01:24.850> 50<00:01:25.300> miles<00:01:25.480> an<00:01:25.600> hour<00:01:25.690> per<00:01:25.990> second<00:01:26.440> and

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
so 50 miles an hour per second and

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.440 
so 50 miles an hour per second and
acceleration<00:01:27.100> will<00:01:27.670> pin<00:01:27.910> me<00:01:28.060> heavily<00:01:28.300> back

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
acceleration will pin me heavily back

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.540 
acceleration will pin me heavily back
into<00:01:28.660> the<00:01:28.750> sea

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
into the sea

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.490 
into the sea
that<00:01:31.120> will<00:01:31.240> last<00:01:31.390> about<00:01:31.540> 45<00:01:31.870> seconds<00:01:32.320> at<00:01:32.410> that

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
that will last about 45 seconds at that

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.110 
that will last about 45 seconds at that
point<00:01:32.710> we'll<00:01:32.830> be<00:01:32.860> doing<00:01:33.070> a<00:01:33.130> thousand<00:01:33.670> miles<00:01:33.880> an

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
point we'll be doing a thousand miles an

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.200 
point we'll be doing a thousand miles an
hour<00:01:34.210> the<00:01:35.050> measured<00:01:35.650> mile<00:01:35.830> will<00:01:36.040> take<00:01:36.210> 3.7

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
hour the measured mile will take 3.7

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.300 
hour the measured mile will take 3.7
seconds<00:01:37.750> just<00:01:38.320> over<00:01:38.560> a<00:01:38.590> thousand<00:01:38.920> miles<00:01:39.040> now

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
seconds just over a thousand miles now

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.070 
seconds just over a thousand miles now
at<00:01:39.790> that<00:01:39.880> point<00:01:40.120> I<00:01:40.240> shut<00:01:40.450> down<00:01:40.480> the<00:01:40.630> jet<00:01:40.930> and

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
at that point I shut down the jet and

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.290 
at that point I shut down the jet and
the<00:01:41.200> rocket<00:01:41.620> and<00:01:42.040> then<00:01:42.190> the<00:01:42.550> drag<00:01:42.880> of<00:01:42.910> the<00:01:43.120> car

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
the rocket and then the drag of the car

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.290 
the rocket and then the drag of the car
starts<00:01:43.900> to<00:01:43.990> slow<00:01:44.170> it<00:01:44.290> down<00:01:44.320> at<00:01:44.920> 3G<00:01:45.730> if<00:01:46.030> you<00:01:46.120> can

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
starts to slow it down at 3G if you can

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.390 
starts to slow it down at 3G if you can
imagine<00:01:46.540> driving<00:01:47.200> a<00:01:47.560> car<00:01:47.740> at<00:01:47.860> 60<00:01:48.130> miles<00:01:48.280> an

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
imagine driving a car at 60 miles an

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.210 
imagine driving a car at 60 miles an
hour<00:01:48.520> down<00:01:49.180> the<00:01:49.210> road<00:01:49.360> and<00:01:49.780> stopping<00:01:50.410> dead<00:01:50.920> in

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
hour down the road and stopping dead in

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.610 
hour down the road and stopping dead in
one<00:01:51.550> second<00:01:52.060> that's<00:01:52.720> the<00:01:52.990> sort<00:01:53.170> of<00:01:53.200> violence

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620 
one second that's the sort of violence

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.080 
one second that's the sort of violence
of<00:01:53.800> deceleration<00:01:54.160> it's<00:01:54.730> going<00:01:54.850> to<00:01:54.910> feel<00:01:55.060> like

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
of deceleration it's going to feel like

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.970 
of deceleration it's going to feel like
so<00:01:55.750> I'm<00:01:55.960> going<00:01:56.140> to<00:01:56.200> have<00:01:56.320> my<00:01:56.440> work<00:01:56.590> cut<00:01:56.620> out<00:01:56.830> for

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980 
so I'm going to have my work cut out for

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.800 
so I'm going to have my work cut out for
that<00:01:57.250> 100<00:01:57.850> seconds<00:01:58.270> that<00:01:58.390> it<00:01:58.480> takes<00:01:58.630> from

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
that 100 seconds that it takes from

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.510 
that 100 seconds that it takes from
stationary<00:01:59.380> to<00:01:59.680> a<00:01:59.710> thousand<00:02:00.160> miles<00:02:00.310> an<00:02:00.430> hour

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
stationary to a thousand miles an hour

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.090

back to stationary covering 10 miles in

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.830 
back to stationary covering 10 miles in
100<00:02:03.550> seconds<00:02:03.910> but<00:02:04.300> I'm<00:02:04.390> gonna<00:02:04.510> have<00:02:04.660> to<00:02:04.750> work

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
100 seconds but I'm gonna have to work

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:11.670 
100 seconds but I'm gonna have to work
quite<00:02:05.050> hard<00:02:05.080> during<00:02:05.470> that<00:02:05.590> ride<00:02:10.500> we've<00:02:11.500> got

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
quite hard during that ride we've got

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.980 
quite hard during that ride we've got
four<00:02:12.100> objectives<00:02:12.250> ready<00:02:12.910> with<00:02:13.090> all<00:02:13.180> this<00:02:13.360> the

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
four objectives ready with all this the

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.650 
four objectives ready with all this the
first<00:02:14.260> is<00:02:14.530> to<00:02:14.710> create<00:02:14.830> a<00:02:15.190> new<00:02:16.120> generation<00:02:16.330> of

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
first is to create a new generation of

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.800 
first is to create a new generation of
Engineers<00:02:16.840> a<00:02:17.410> second<00:02:18.400> one<00:02:18.550> is<00:02:18.940> basically<00:02:19.660> to

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
Engineers a second one is basically to

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.960 
Engineers a second one is basically to
provide<00:02:20.080> a<00:02:20.140> project<00:02:20.800> that<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.250> students<00:02:21.790> and

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
provide a project that the students and

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.330 
provide a project that the students and
the<00:02:22.300> school<00:02:22.420> kids<00:02:22.810> can<00:02:23.380> get<00:02:23.590> into<00:02:23.980> and<00:02:24.130> really

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
the school kids can get into and really

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.760 
the school kids can get into and really
understand<00:02:24.880> and<00:02:25.120> really<00:02:25.180> learn<00:02:25.570> from<00:02:25.770> third

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
understand and really learn from third

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.230 
understand and really learn from third
one<00:02:27.010> is<00:02:27.130> to<00:02:27.250> get<00:02:27.340> our<00:02:27.490> thousand<00:02:27.850> mile<00:02:28.030> an<00:02:28.150> hour

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
one is to get our thousand mile an hour

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.910 
one is to get our thousand mile an hour
record<00:02:28.450> and<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:28.990> fourth<00:02:29.230> is<00:02:29.440> to<00:02:29.560> generate<00:02:29.890> a

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
record and the fourth is to generate a

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.810 
record and the fourth is to generate a
lot<00:02:30.190> of<00:02:30.220> publicity<00:02:30.430> for<00:02:30.790> our<00:02:30.970> sponsors<00:02:31.210> so

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
lot of publicity for our sponsors so

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.370 
lot of publicity for our sponsors so
what<00:02:33.820> sort<00:02:34.030> of<00:02:34.090> science<00:02:34.420> are<00:02:34.570> we<00:02:34.630> using<00:02:34.840> it's

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
what sort of science are we using it's

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.530 
what sort of science are we using it's
it's<00:02:35.680> physics<00:02:36.100> its<00:02:36.370> maths<00:02:36.640> okay<00:02:37.090> so<00:02:37.150> what<00:02:37.390> so

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
it's physics its maths okay so what so

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.320 
it's physics its maths okay so what so
we're<00:02:37.720> in<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:37.989> area<00:02:38.500> of<00:02:38.680> aerodynamics

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
we're in the area of aerodynamics

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.210 
we're in the area of aerodynamics
what<00:02:42.200> we're<00:02:42.350> trying<00:02:42.500> to<00:02:42.620> do<00:02:42.680> is<00:02:42.770> understand

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
what we're trying to do is understand

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.920 
what we're trying to do is understand
their<00:02:43.400> dynamics<00:02:43.790> using<00:02:44.060> computational

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
their dynamics using computational

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.870 
their dynamics using computational
modeling<00:02:45.320> so<00:02:45.410> we<00:02:45.470> use<00:02:45.620> big<00:02:45.830> computers<00:02:46.370> to

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
modeling so we use big computers to

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.580 
modeling so we use big computers to
solve<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.270> complicated<00:02:47.840> equations<00:02:48.350> that

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
solve the complicated equations that

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.950 
solve the complicated equations that
describe<00:02:49.190> aerodynamics<00:02:49.850> and<00:02:50.570> using<00:02:50.870> these

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
describe aerodynamics and using these

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.450 
describe aerodynamics and using these
big<00:02:51.140> computers<00:02:51.590> we<00:02:51.770> can<00:02:51.800> get<00:02:52.010> numbers<00:02:52.370> out

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
big computers we can get numbers out

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.640 
big computers we can get numbers out
that<00:02:52.640> tell<00:02:52.820> us<00:02:52.970> well<00:02:53.150> at<00:02:53.540> this<00:02:53.780> speed<00:02:54.050> these

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
that tell us well at this speed these

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.010 
that tell us well at this speed these
are<00:02:54.800> the<00:02:54.860> forces<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:55.280> car<00:02:55.460> will<00:02:55.550> experience

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
are the forces the car will experience

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.510 
are the forces the car will experience
with<00:02:57.020> a<00:02:57.050> long<00:02:57.320> process<00:02:57.620> to<00:02:57.830> go<00:02:58.130> through<00:02:58.370> before

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
with a long process to go through before

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.370 
with a long process to go through before
we<00:02:58.700> go<00:02:58.880> to<00:02:58.940> South<00:02:59.210> Africa<00:02:59.270> and<00:02:59.780> start<00:02:59.960> testing

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
we go to South Africa and start testing

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.110 
we go to South Africa and start testing
there<00:03:00.620> we've<00:03:00.920> got<00:03:01.070> testing<00:03:01.460> to<00:03:01.550> do<00:03:01.670> in<00:03:01.790> the<00:03:01.880> UK

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
there we've got testing to do in the UK

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.400 
there we've got testing to do in the UK
on<00:03:02.510> a<00:03:02.570> runway

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
on a runway

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.320 
on a runway
it<00:03:03.770> starts<00:03:04.130> initially<00:03:04.610> with<00:03:04.790> commissioning

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
it starts initially with commissioning

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.230 
it starts initially with commissioning
the<00:03:05.450> car<00:03:05.660> in<00:03:05.810> the<00:03:05.900> workshop<00:03:06.380> we<00:03:06.820> then<00:03:07.820> take<00:03:08.090> the

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
the car in the workshop we then take the

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.410 
the car in the workshop we then take the
car<00:03:08.450> to<00:03:09.140> an<00:03:09.380> airfield<00:03:09.560> and<00:03:09.980> do<00:03:10.370> tie-down<00:03:11.120> test

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
car to an airfield and do tie-down test

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.700 
car to an airfield and do tie-down test
so<00:03:11.540> we<00:03:11.630> tie<00:03:11.810> the<00:03:11.870> car<00:03:12.140> to<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.290> ground<00:03:12.530> just

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:12.710 
so we tie the car to the ground just

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.920 
so we tie the car to the ground just
like<00:03:12.800> an<00:03:12.920> aircraft<00:03:13.130> and<00:03:13.580> run<00:03:14.270> the<00:03:14.420> engines<00:03:14.750> up

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
like an aircraft and run the engines up

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.600 
like an aircraft and run the engines up
and<00:03:15.260> check<00:03:15.590> that<00:03:15.710> all<00:03:15.830> the<00:03:15.860> systems<00:03:16.370> are

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
and check that all the systems are

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.820 
and check that all the systems are
functioning<00:03:17.090> and<00:03:17.240> that<00:03:17.870> we're<00:03:18.260> in<00:03:18.320> control<00:03:18.620> of

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
functioning and that we're in control of

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.010 
functioning and that we're in control of
the<00:03:18.920> car<00:03:19.100> once<00:03:19.910> we've<00:03:20.090> established<00:03:20.209> that<00:03:20.600> the

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
the car once we've established that the

some of these questions what we've

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.030 
some of these questions what we've
developed<00:03:53.330> is<00:03:53.510> is<00:03:53.840> a<00:03:54.260> model<00:03:54.739> that<00:03:54.860> tries<00:03:55.010> to

understand how the the dust that gets

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.210 
understand how the the dust that gets
entrained<00:03:57.290> into<00:03:57.500> the<00:03:57.620> flow<00:03:57.769> will<00:03:57.890> affect<00:03:58.130> the

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
entrained into the flow will affect the

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.650 
entrained into the flow will affect the
vehicle<00:03:58.580> now<00:03:58.700> that<00:03:58.850> has<00:03:59.000> lots<00:03:59.209> of<00:03:59.300> spin-offs

the aerodynamic flow around them we can

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.199 
the aerodynamic flow around them we can
apply<00:04:06.769> this<00:04:06.830> technology<00:04:07.190> to<00:04:07.489> that<00:04:07.670> once<00:04:08.090> we

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
apply this technology to that once we

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:09.430 
apply this technology to that once we

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
already you're teaching them about

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:54.820 
already you're teaching them about
science<00:04:54.050> and<00:04:54.140> engineering<00:04:54.500> they<00:04:54.590> don't<00:04:54.740> even

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
science and engineering they don't even

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.470 
science and engineering they don't even
know<00:04:55.070> it<00:04:55.220> so<00:04:55.970> we're<00:04:56.090> seeing<00:04:56.240> it<00:04:56.360> happen

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
know it so we're seeing it happen

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.180 
know it so we're seeing it happen
already<00:04:56.750> and<00:04:57.020> certainly<00:04:57.290> once<00:04:57.440> this<00:04:57.860> vehicle

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
already and certainly once this vehicle

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:59.980 
already and certainly once this vehicle
is<00:04:58.280> built<00:04:58.580> and<00:04:59.120> we've<00:04:59.270> run<00:04:59.390> it<00:04:59.510> on<00:04:59.600> the<00:04:59.690> desert

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
is built and we've run it on the desert

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.360 
is built and we've run it on the desert
that's<00:05:00.110> going<00:05:00.260> to<00:05:00.320> be<00:05:00.410> such<00:05:00.680> a<00:05:00.710> spectacular

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
that's going to be such a spectacular

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.520 
that's going to be such a spectacular
event<00:05:01.760> I<00:05:02.030> think<00:05:02.240> it<00:05:02.480> can't<00:05:02.690> fail<00:05:02.900> to<00:05:03.350> inspire

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
event I think it can't fail to inspire

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.010 
event I think it can't fail to inspire
kids
