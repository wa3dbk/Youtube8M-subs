00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
30 watts we are make sure we're going to

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.769 
30 watts we are make sure we're going to
start<00:00:26.369> on<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.849> hundred<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.300> twenty<00:00:27.660> watts

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
start on the hundred and twenty watts

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:46.639 
start on the hundred and twenty watts
setting<00:00:44.270> okay<00:00:45.270> it's<00:00:45.480> very<00:00:45.719> tight<00:00:46.110> punchy<00:00:46.620> I

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
setting okay it's very tight punchy I

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.470 
setting okay it's very tight punchy I
would<00:00:46.920> say<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.190> can<00:00:47.550> hear<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.879> attack<00:00:48.149> really

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
would say you can hear the attack really

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.779 
would say you can hear the attack really
well<00:00:48.629> now<00:00:49.320> let's<00:00:49.559> switch<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.100> 60<00:00:50.640> watt

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
well now let's switch it to the 60 watt

00:00:50.789 --> 00:01:14.740 
well now let's switch it to the 60 watt
setting

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.740 

it's<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.810> lot<00:01:16.020> more<00:01:16.229> pillowy<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.979> lot<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.969> lot<00:01:18.539> less

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
it's a lot more pillowy a lot a lot less

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.560 
it's a lot more pillowy a lot a lot less
attack<00:01:19.110> sound<00:01:19.469> smoother<00:01:20.180> let's<00:01:21.180> check<00:01:21.420> out

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
attack sound smoother let's check out

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:43.819 
attack sound smoother let's check out
the<00:01:21.600> 30<00:01:22.020> watt<00:01:22.229> setting<00:01:41.869> it's<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.960> lot<00:01:43.170> smoother

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
the 30 watt setting it's a lot smoother

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.520 
the 30 watt setting it's a lot smoother
I<00:01:44.069> would<00:01:44.490> say<00:01:44.729> less<00:01:45.450> attack<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:46.349> it<00:01:46.500> just

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
I would say less attack so it just

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.559 
I would say less attack so it just
sounds<00:01:46.950> like<00:01:47.069> a<00:01:47.099> more<00:01:47.310> pillowy<00:01:47.610> smooth<00:01:48.060> sound

00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:48.569 
sounds like a more pillowy smooth sound

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:50.929 
sounds like a more pillowy smooth sound
to<00:01:48.869> me<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.979> would<00:01:50.130> want<00:01:50.429> to<00:01:50.549> use<00:01:50.729> these

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
to me you would want to use these

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.460 
to me you would want to use these
different<00:01:51.360> settings<00:01:51.750> in<00:01:51.990> different

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
different settings in different

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.679 
different settings in different
scenarios<00:01:52.679> and<00:01:53.189> situations<00:01:53.429> like<00:01:54.240> maybe<00:01:54.569> you

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
scenarios and situations like maybe you

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.300 
scenarios and situations like maybe you
have<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.899> room<00:01:55.140> size<00:01:55.470> or<00:01:55.890> something<00:01:56.189> like

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
have the room size or something like

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.899 
have the room size or something like
that<00:01:57.860> so<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:59.159> is<00:01:59.520> the<00:02:00.560> Jackson<00:02:01.560> ampworks

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
that so that is the Jackson ampworks

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.599 
that so that is the Jackson ampworks
