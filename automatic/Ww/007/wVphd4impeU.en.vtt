I<00:00:00.060> was<00:00:00.210> always<00:00:00.329> fascinated<00:00:00.630> with<00:00:01.199> how<00:00:01.380> things

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
I was always fascinated with how things

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.619 
I was always fascinated with how things
work<00:00:01.920> no<00:00:02.340> matter<00:00:02.429> how<00:00:02.669> big<00:00:02.879> or<00:00:02.970> small<00:00:03.030> bear<00:00:03.419> I

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
work no matter how big or small bear I

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.930 
work no matter how big or small bear I
always<00:00:03.840> wanted<00:00:04.020> to<00:00:04.080> take<00:00:04.770> them<00:00:04.920> apart<00:00:05.040> see<00:00:05.790> how

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
always wanted to take them apart see how

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.849 
always wanted to take them apart see how
they<00:00:06.060> work<00:00:06.210> put<00:00:06.450> them<00:00:06.569> back<00:00:06.690> together<00:00:06.899> make

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
they work put them back together make

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.759 
they work put them back together make
sure<00:00:08.040> that<00:00:08.189> they<00:00:08.280> work<00:00:08.400> again<00:00:08.700> hopefully<00:00:08.970> and

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:09.769 
sure that they work again hopefully and

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:11.780 
sure that they work again hopefully and
mechanical<00:00:10.769> engineering<00:00:11.309> specifically

mechanical engineering specifically
because<00:00:11.940> mechanical<00:00:12.599> engineering<00:00:13.080> comes

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
because mechanical engineering comes

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.499 
because mechanical engineering comes

brush their travel and we were kind of
like<00:00:44.070> London<00:00:44.399> but<00:00:44.640> ten<00:00:44.850> times<00:00:44.879> worse<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.719> when

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
like London but ten times worse and when

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.200 
like London but ten times worse and when
I<00:00:46.379> saw<00:00:46.559> blue<00:00:46.739> Morgan<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.309> when<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:47.940> searched

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
I saw blue Morgan and when I searched

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.000 
I saw blue Morgan and when I searched
for<00:00:48.329> somewheres<00:00:49.020> where<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.320> was<00:00:49.469> based<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:49.860> mean

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
for somewheres where it was based I mean

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.209 
for somewheres where it was based I mean
the<00:00:50.340> scenery<00:00:50.789> was<00:00:51.660> amazing<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.440> knew<00:00:52.680> that

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
the scenery was amazing and I knew that

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.979 
the scenery was amazing and I knew that
I<00:00:53.250> could<00:00:53.430> actually<00:00:53.520> focus<00:00:54.030> on<00:00:54.059> my<00:00:54.539> University

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
I could actually focus on my University

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.600 
I could actually focus on my University
rather<00:00:55.230> than<00:00:55.379> focus<00:00:55.680> on<00:00:55.739> how<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:55.980> live<00:00:56.190> in<00:00:56.520> a

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
rather than focus on how to live in a

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.610 
rather than focus on how to live in a
big<00:00:56.760> city<00:00:56.910> or<00:00:57.030> how<00:00:57.210> do<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.360> know<00:00:57.539> maneuver<00:00:58.469> my

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
big city or how do you know maneuver my

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.170 
big city or how do you know maneuver my
way<00:00:58.649> around<00:00:58.949> just<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.399> get<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.789> place<00:01:00.030> of

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
way around just to get to place of

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.389 
way around just to get to place of
Education<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.809> because<00:01:00.840> it's<00:01:01.829> so<00:01:02.070> secluded

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
Education and because it's so secluded

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.310 
Education and because it's so secluded
from<00:01:03.149> any<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.510> sort<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.690> distractions

you come down here everything is more
toned<00:01:09.030> down<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.540> can<00:01:09.689> actually<00:01:09.900> focus<00:01:10.500> on

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
toned down and you can actually focus on

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
an Internet student first people that I

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.950 
an Internet student first people that I
saw<00:01:17.009> actually<00:01:17.610> were<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.360> Internet's<00:01:18.720> stuff

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
saw actually were the Internet's stuff

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.880 
saw actually were the Internet's stuff
from<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.140> people<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.380> are<00:01:19.500> working<00:01:19.590> for<00:01:19.830> the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
from the people that are working for the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.160 
from the people that are working for the
International<00:01:20.340> stuff<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.700> they<00:01:20.880> themselves

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
International stuff and they themselves

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.660 
International stuff and they themselves
were<00:01:22.170> international<00:01:22.710> students<00:01:23.070> so

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
were international students so

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.580 
were international students so
immediately<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.630> established<00:01:25.439> that

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
immediately I established that

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.960 
immediately I established that

every<00:03:05.170> year<00:03:05.290> you<00:03:05.470> come<00:03:05.620> up<00:03:05.739> they<00:03:06.220> make<00:03:06.730> you<00:03:06.820> do

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
every year you come up they make you do

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.070 
every year you come up they make you do
all<00:03:06.940> these<00:03:07.150> new<00:03:07.299> experiments<00:03:07.840> to<00:03:07.900> make<00:03:07.989> you

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
all these new experiments to make you

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.199 
all these new experiments to make you
understand<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.650> course<00:03:08.920> better<00:03:09.190> for<00:03:10.120> example

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
understand the course better for example

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.320 
understand the course better for example
I<00:03:10.570> mean<00:03:10.720> we<00:03:10.870> have<00:03:10.989> this<00:03:11.970> funky-looking<00:03:12.970> thing

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
I mean we have this funky-looking thing

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.479 
I mean we have this funky-looking thing
right<00:03:13.510> here<00:03:13.660> which<00:03:14.170> is<00:03:14.290> basically<00:03:14.620> used<00:03:15.370> for

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
right here which is basically used for

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.610 
right here which is basically used for
balancing<00:03:16.060> of<00:03:16.180> rotational<00:03:16.600> masses<00:03:17.019> and<00:03:17.500> what

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
balancing of rotational masses and what

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.680 
balancing of rotational masses and what
it<00:03:17.709> does<00:03:17.860> is<00:03:18.010> when<00:03:18.130> you<00:03:18.190> put<00:03:18.250> it<00:03:18.489> on<00:03:18.610> if<00:03:18.910> these

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
it does is when you put it on if these

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.110 
it does is when you put it on if these
masses<00:03:20.170> down<00:03:20.320> here<00:03:20.530> not<00:03:20.680> balance<00:03:21.070> and<00:03:21.340> the

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
masses down here not balance and the

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.430 
masses down here not balance and the
whole<00:03:22.299> world<00:03:22.480> machine<00:03:22.810> vibrates<00:03:23.260> in<00:03:23.380> the

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
whole world machine vibrates in the

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.110 
whole world machine vibrates in the
whole<00:03:23.560> table<00:03:23.799> vibrations<00:03:24.459> basically<00:03:24.820> jump

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
whole table vibrations basically jump

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.420 
whole table vibrations basically jump
off<00:03:25.299> the<00:03:25.840> table<00:03:26.019> but<00:03:26.799> you<00:03:26.920> need<00:03:27.040> to<00:03:27.160> do<00:03:27.280> the

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
off the table but you need to do the

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.430 
off the table but you need to do the
exact<00:03:27.730> calculations<00:03:28.390> and<00:03:28.660> this<00:03:29.049> is<00:03:29.200> how<00:03:29.320> it

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
exact calculations and this is how it

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.110 
exact calculations and this is how it
translates<00:03:29.829> from<00:03:30.190> theory<00:03:30.640> to<00:03:30.760> practical

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
translates from theory to practical

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.759 
translates from theory to practical
impractical<00:03:31.660> back<00:03:31.810> to<00:03:31.900> theory<00:03:32.140> and<00:03:32.560> you

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
impractical back to theory and you

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.740 
impractical back to theory and you
actually<00:03:33.040> break<00:03:33.190> it<00:03:33.340> down<00:03:33.459> pen<00:03:33.910> paper<00:03:34.209> pencil

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
actually break it down pen paper pencil

it according to what you think is right
and<00:03:39.190> check<00:03:39.670> if<00:03:39.820> it<00:03:39.910> works<00:03:40.090> right<00:03:40.390> then<00:03:40.780> also

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
and check if it works right then also

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.479

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
conflicting to yours what this course

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.850 
conflicting to yours what this course
does<00:03:52.630> specifically<00:03:53.049> what<00:03:53.230> engineering<00:03:53.709> does

is it's not a debate or a discussion you

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.500 
is it's not a debate or a discussion you
can<00:03:56.590> actually<00:03:56.739> prove<00:03:57.190> the<00:03:57.760> fact<00:03:58.000> about<00:03:58.299> who's

can actually prove the fact about who's

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.060 
can actually prove the fact about who's
right<00:03:58.780> and<00:03:58.810> who's<00:03:58.989> wrong<00:03:59.110> right<00:03:59.769> at<00:03:59.920> that

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
right and who's wrong right at that

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.039 
right and who's wrong right at that
point<00:04:00.280> but<00:04:00.459> by<00:04:00.610> doing<00:04:00.880> the<00:04:00.940> calculations<00:04:01.540> so

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
point but by doing the calculations so

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:04.170 
point but by doing the calculations so
we<00:04:02.170> had<00:04:02.320> a<00:04:02.350> lot<00:04:02.650> of<00:04:02.890> teamwork<00:04:03.489> a<00:04:03.790> lot<00:04:03.820> of<00:04:03.940> team

the international best award project of
the<00:04:19.310> year<00:04:19.550> for<00:04:20.000> that<00:04:20.150> choice<00:04:20.750> of<00:04:20.900> Records<00:04:21.140> but

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
the year for that choice of Records but

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.380 
the year for that choice of Records but
that's<00:04:21.650> how<00:04:21.739> it's<00:04:21.860> based<00:04:22.040> and<00:04:22.310> basically<00:04:23.270> it

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
that's how it's based and basically it

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.860 
that's how it's based and basically it
was<00:04:23.540> about<00:04:24.760> processing<00:04:25.760> sensory<00:04:26.030> data<00:04:26.420> from

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
was about processing sensory data from

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.200 
was about processing sensory data from
industrial<00:04:27.110> steam<00:04:27.650> heating<00:04:28.130> furnaces<00:04:28.580> for

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
industrial steam heating furnaces for

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.670 
industrial steam heating furnaces for
the<00:04:29.330> possibility<00:04:29.840> of<00:04:29.870> predicting<00:04:30.290> control

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
the possibility of predicting control

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.920 
the possibility of predicting control
was<00:04:31.130> an<00:04:31.220> industry<00:04:31.640> project<00:04:32.030> from<00:04:32.570> chorus

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
was an industry project from chorus

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.570 
was an industry project from chorus
start<00:04:33.380> actually<00:04:33.830> which<00:04:33.980> is<00:04:34.010> down<00:04:34.220> the<00:04:34.250> portal

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
start actually which is down the portal

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.790 
start actually which is down the portal
but<00:04:34.790> I<00:04:34.850> think<00:04:35.060> and<00:04:35.290> they<00:04:36.290> sent<00:04:36.470> us<00:04:36.530> all<00:04:36.680> the

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
but I think and they sent us all the

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.920 
but I think and they sent us all the
data<00:04:36.950> and<00:04:37.310> I've<00:04:38.090> really<00:04:38.300> had<00:04:38.390> a<00:04:38.450> fury<00:04:38.690> came

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
data and I've really had a fury came

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.420 
data and I've really had a fury came
over<00:04:39.080> that<00:04:39.140> about<00:04:39.410> four<00:04:39.620> o'clock<00:04:39.650> a<00:04:40.160> week

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
over that about four o'clock a week

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.070 
over that about four o'clock a week
before<00:04:40.790> had<00:04:40.910> to<00:04:41.000> give<00:04:41.150> my<00:04:41.270> dissertation<00:04:41.600> in

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
before had to give my dissertation in

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.230 
before had to give my dissertation in
and<00:04:42.580> everything<00:04:43.580> was<00:04:43.730> done<00:04:43.880> then<00:04:44.060> the<00:04:44.120> day

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
and everything was done then the day

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.730 
and everything was done then the day
that<00:04:44.270> didn't<00:04:44.570> make<00:04:44.660> any<00:04:44.900> sense<00:04:45.110> I<00:04:45.410> was<00:04:45.530> looking

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
that didn't make any sense I was looking

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.800 
that didn't make any sense I was looking
at<00:04:45.830> graphs<00:04:46.040> because<00:04:46.520> numbers<00:04:47.480> of<00:04:47.660> lines

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
at graphs because numbers of lines

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.740 
at graphs because numbers of lines
didn't<00:04:48.140> make<00:04:48.230> any<00:04:48.350> sense<00:04:48.560> and<00:04:48.970> just<00:04:49.970> at<00:04:50.180> four

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
didn't make any sense and just at four

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.480 
didn't make any sense and just at four
o'clock<00:04:50.780> it<00:04:51.110> just<00:04:51.290> hit<00:04:51.440> me<00:04:51.620> and<00:04:51.890> I<00:04:52.250> came<00:04:52.460> up

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
o'clock it just hit me and I came up

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.720 
o'clock it just hit me and I came up
with<00:04:52.700> a<00:04:52.730> new<00:04:52.850> formula<00:04:53.060> which<00:04:53.990> sort<00:04:54.260> of

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
with a new formula which sort of

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.100 
with a new formula which sort of
assesses<00:04:55.730> the<00:04:55.820> moving<00:04:56.120> average<00:04:56.510> of<00:04:56.780> the

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
assesses the moving average of the

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.800 
assesses the moving average of the
dynamics<00:04:57.560> of<00:04:57.620> the<00:04:57.740> system<00:04:57.770> and<00:04:58.220> that<00:04:58.810> again

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
dynamics of the system and that again

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.080 
dynamics of the system and that again
was<00:05:00.320> just<00:05:00.740> sort<00:05:01.250> of<00:05:01.280> the<00:05:01.430> implementation<00:05:02.030> of

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
was just sort of the implementation of

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.070 
was just sort of the implementation of
all<00:05:02.360> the<00:05:03.230> skills<00:05:03.530> where<00:05:03.950> the<00:05:04.040> technical<00:05:04.430> or

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
all the skills where the technical or

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.750 
all the skills where the technical or
research<00:05:06.080> methods<00:05:06.650> or<00:05:07.010> working<00:05:07.520> with<00:05:07.640> my

colleagues<00:05:08.120> or<00:05:08.240> suggestions<00:05:08.630> all<00:05:08.780> of<00:05:08.990> that

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.140 
colleagues or suggestions all of that

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.050 
colleagues or suggestions all of that
sort<00:05:09.350> of<00:05:09.380> boiled<00:05:09.800> down<00:05:09.920> to<00:05:10.160> my<00:05:10.400> project<00:05:10.850> I

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
sort of boiled down to my project I

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.000 
sort of boiled down to my project I
would<00:05:11.510> recommend<00:05:11.900> this<00:05:12.020> cost<00:05:12.230> anyone<00:05:12.740> that's

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
would recommend this cost anyone that's

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.680 
would recommend this cost anyone that's
ever<00:05:13.160> been<00:05:13.370> inquisitive<00:05:14.090> about<00:05:14.390> the

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
ever been inquisitive about the

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.440 
ever been inquisitive about the
functioning<00:05:15.500> of<00:05:15.910> anything<00:05:16.910> literally

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
functioning of anything literally

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.780 
functioning of anything literally
because<00:05:17.690> it<00:05:17.720> teaches<00:05:17.960> you<00:05:18.200> a<00:05:18.230> lot<00:05:18.470> but<00:05:19.190> like<00:05:19.760> I

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
because it teaches you a lot but like I

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:20.950 
because it teaches you a lot but like I
said<00:05:20.000> the<00:05:20.090> approach<00:05:20.330> to<00:05:20.450> the<00:05:20.540> functioning<00:05:20.900> of

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
said the approach to the functioning of

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.260 
said the approach to the functioning of
physics<00:05:21.530> in<00:05:21.680> general<00:05:21.860> and<00:05:22.220> especially<00:05:22.910> if
