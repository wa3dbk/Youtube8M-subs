00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.030
 we didn't jump back into the 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.139
 time me and andrea this weekend 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.350
 even if the one I have behind me 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.209
 it looks like the Rome of the old empire 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.070
 in short, a few centuries ago and we are not 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:18.599
 we didn't even do one 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.720
 jump back in time to present 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:23.970
 the fiesta of 1976 man to present 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.830
 what the restyling weblog 2012 o 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.859
 2013 if you prefer considering that in Italy 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.990
 will arrive early next year 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.210
 new version the penultimate era of 2008 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.010
 important news on this car of 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.480
 segment b which has as much technology as 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.850
 if it was a car in a segment 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.300
 much much more much more reward 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.920
 luxurious I now ask to come closer 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.590
 so at least I'll show you what 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.280
 changes from the previous version 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.629
 well we have a front carved on 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.239
 bonnet is a trapezoidal grille 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.090
 much more impact a family feeling the 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.210
 ford's new dna will be this too 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:06.390
 on the new world cup we'll see a little more 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:08.190
 in there lights with LED headlights and also a lot 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.620
 stretched while at the rear 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.320
 not much has been changed except the 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.850
 headlight design also because the 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.760
 more action was needed 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.000
 on the front and therefore ford has moved 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:24.180
 so a boot capacity really 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.680
 wide you are comfortably there 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.000
 comfortably a couple of trolleys then there is 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.700
 also a lower cockpit than there 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.680
 allows you to enter more 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.009
 suitcases, bags, all that 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.979
 what you want and as I said before one 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:41.350
 dashboard via that through the display 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.929
 5 inch allows access to 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.659
 all those that are what they are 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:48.819
 technological innovations 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.619
 here we are finally at the helm of this 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:54.610
 new fortress we are on the streets of 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:57.939
 roma you see them the colosseum day of 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.390
 only a few marches in Rome for several 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:03.340
 reasons forces us to alternative roads 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.560
 but all is well to try this 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.440
 new for fiesta that gives us an experience 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.720
 really interesting driving 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:14.530
 especially because it has a very good one 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:17.769
 habitability and on board are not heard i 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.420
 particularly strange noises or games 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.670
 of plastics 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.890
 in short, the driving position is high 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.840
 the windshield allows us a wide 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.819
 visual and even behind when you do 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.230
 maneuver no problem 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.730
 despite the uprights are not 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.069
 probably very small indeed 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:37.209
 obviously help the driving sensors 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:39.970
 the change is very light on time 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:42.549
 the clutch grafts are dry us 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.010
 and we're driving a 1000 3 engine 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.450
 125 horsepower cylinders the same as 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.450
 we saw on the ford test 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.549
 focus was very good on for focus va 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.130
 very good super focus is fine on 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.380
 ford fiesta and has an acceleration from 0 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.030
 100 in 9.4 seconds a maximum speed 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:02.079
 which of course we failed to 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:05.670
 so stay of 196 km per hour 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:08.560
 direct the perfect change the 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.290
 electric power steering and then steering 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.200
 in general we have a steering wheel from the 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.690
 impeccable diameter is neither too much 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.579
 large or too small and allows us 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.880
 interesting steering angles 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:23.650
 excellent handling in the city and beyond 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.930
 to particular games therefore direct 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.510
 also the steering on board the 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.690
 plastics are certainly not essential 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.490
 but rather 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.470
 they make you think of a product not of the 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:39.070
 b segment but a more premium product 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:41.650
 more luxury than driving very easily and 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.650
 soft suspensions manage to 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.660
 allow us an excellent driving comfort 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.670
 within the cities with the inspiration 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.940
 which conjugated to the 1000 3 cylinder engine 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.740
 from 125 horses in short the possibility 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.530
 also to leave us behind maybe 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:59.560
 some slow scooter some pickup truck 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.209
 in short, someone who doesn't go on the street 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.160
 as we obviously want we must 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.700
 always be careful of everything there 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.489
 surrounds 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.350
 the start and stop works without big 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:11.050
 problems just put the change in 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.750
 crazy and release the clutch when there 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.580
 let's stop, for example, at the bastion traffic lights 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.730
 crush the clutch because the engine 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.320
 comes back on continues to go there 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.160
 the air conditioning 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:27.550
 the air conditioner is very powerful and is 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:32.320
 especially very very easy to use 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:36.040
 with these two wheels and this ring 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.540
 central importance they gave in 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.180
 presentation phase of this for 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.440
 fiesta to the car's capacity of 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.450
 reach optimal temperature 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.900
 inside the engine 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:48.520
 so once it turned on so much 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.950
 this is important because it allows a 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.260
 less gasoline consumption of course 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.900
 this is already an engine that saves 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.490
 a lot from this point of view but 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.100
 conjugated to this new possibility by 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.169
 large savings margin 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.669
 so much on-board technology does not appear 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:06.280
 really being inside one 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:08.410
 segment b car because why 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.390
 in addition to the active city stop up to 30 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.010
 per hour it allows us to reduce the amount 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.570
 of any accidents or 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.250
 stop at the moment for example 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:19.009
 extend a roundabout we see that 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:21.050
 in front of us someone stops there 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:25.249
 the possibility of using corn 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:27.139
 inca at the infotainment level for which 

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:29.689
 to connect ours ours 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:31.249
 smartphone to use not only 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:32.509
 bluetooth and then calls but 

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:34.279
 also everything that concerns 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:35.599
 the use of music 

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:38.210
 we always have to the point of view 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:40.430
 also a navigator infotainment 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.999
 satellite in this case a garmin that 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:45.289
 is connected directly to the 

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:47.059
 car itself 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:49.849
 and then we never have who is a system 

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:51.979
 new that debuts at European level on 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:54.229
 this for fiesta that allows us to 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:55.490
 do what good to leave the car to 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:56.779
 our children for example 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.969
 said so does not mean nothing vi 

00:05:56.779 --> 00:06:02.930
 I explain what it means just that we 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:04.849
 let's go fishing the menu and in the menu the 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.990
 my kids item to activate now not 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:08.300
 I can show you why it's already here 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.399
 been activated to activate a whole 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.559
 set of security protocols there 

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:14.360
 let you leave with a heart a 

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:15.669
 the car is lighter than our children 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.110
 so we can intervene 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:21.050
 on the prevention of disabling 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:23.559
 of certain safety commands and 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:26.240
 for example on the possibility of 

00:06:23.559 --> 00:06:29.749
 warn the driver when passing 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.520
 a certain speed or when the 

00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:33.319
 in short, petrol is about to run out 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.800
 all very very things 

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:38.770
 interesting 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.419
 this car is the maximum available 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.220
 from the point of view of the optional is a 

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:44.979
 full optional for parking sensors 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:47.139
 as I said before, very useful acoustics 

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:50.139
 in maneuver phase 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:52.509
 the mirrors are not tapered 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:55.449
 particularly large so it will serve a 

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:57.460
 minimum of habit to enter 

00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:58.599
 in short, in harmony with theirs 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.220
 dimension 

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:01.990
 our a three-door version but 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.580
 behind it you are quite comfortable indeed 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:06.310
 if I drive, of course, space 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:08.379
 but it really diminishes behind it 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:11.949
 not bad this first contact with 

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:14.169
 this new ford fiesta we hope to 

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:16.389
 then have proof for our canons 

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:18.669
 more in-depth appointments 

00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:21.870
 then we will repeat all our ones 

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:21.870
 usual insights
