00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:06.959 
years and told the people who want a

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:09.710 
years and told the people who want a
sense<00:02:07.259> of<00:02:07.380> games<00:02:07.679> to<00:02:07.979> fucking<00:02:08.489> sit<00:02:08.819> on<00:02:09.269> a<00:02:09.329> dick

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
sense of games to fucking sit on a dick

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.660 
sense of games to fucking sit on a dick
so<00:02:10.649> that's<00:02:10.860> what's<00:02:11.069> going<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.340> happen

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
so that's what's going to happen

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.509 
so that's what's going to happen
possibly<00:02:12.239> now<00:02:12.569> this<00:02:12.930> is<00:02:13.230> our<00:02:13.650> main<00:02:13.860> character

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
possibly now this is our main character

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.809 
possibly now this is our main character
and<00:02:15.019> actually<00:02:16.019> my<00:02:16.620> theory<00:02:16.950> is<00:02:17.129> that<00:02:17.220> he<00:02:17.700> is

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
and actually my theory is that he is

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.650 
and actually my theory is that he is
also<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.590> bastard<00:02:19.590> his<00:02:19.890> name<00:02:20.250> is<00:02:20.940> shined<00:02:21.420> ER

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
also the bastard his name is shined ER

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.410 
also the bastard his name is shined ER
or<00:02:22.170> shinder<00:02:22.829> or<00:02:23.370> something<00:02:23.910> like<00:02:24.060> that<00:02:24.120> I

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
or shinder or something like that I

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.849 
or shinder or something like that I
don't<00:02:24.600> know<00:02:24.810> what<00:02:24.989> they're<00:02:25.139> going<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.319> wind<00:02:25.680> up

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:25.859
