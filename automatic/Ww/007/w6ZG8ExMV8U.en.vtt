00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.210 

okay<00:00:00.630> this<00:00:00.810> is<00:00:00.989> the<00:00:01.110> Apple<00:00:01.410> iPhone<00:00:01.560> charger

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
okay this is the Apple iPhone charger

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.430 
okay this is the Apple iPhone charger
and<00:00:02.700> I<00:00:03.330> wanted<00:00:03.720> to<00:00:03.810> do<00:00:03.929> a<00:00:03.959> little<00:00:04.080> bit<00:00:04.290> of<00:00:04.380> a

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
and I wanted to do a little bit of a

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.039 
and I wanted to do a little bit of a
dissection<00:00:04.799> to<00:00:05.100> figure<00:00:05.370> out<00:00:05.520> how<00:00:05.670> to<00:00:06.020> take<00:00:07.020> it

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
dissection to figure out how to take it

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.820 
dissection to figure out how to take it
apart<00:00:07.200> because<00:00:07.770> this<00:00:08.069> one<00:00:08.250> is<00:00:08.370> broken<00:00:08.550> and

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:09.830 
apart because this one is broken and

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.350 
apart because this one is broken and
basically<00:00:10.830> put<00:00:11.070> a<00:00:11.099> drill<00:00:11.370> bit<00:00:11.519> here<00:00:11.790> and<00:00:11.940> this

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
basically put a drill bit here and this

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:22.620 
basically put a drill bit here and this
thing<00:00:12.570> flew<00:00:12.960> out<00:00:13.490> so<00:00:14.490> this

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:01:51.050 

you

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.910 

the<00:01:51.510> ribbon<00:01:51.870> cable<00:01:52.260> connecting<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.770> top

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
the ribbon cable connecting the top

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.320 
the ribbon cable connecting the top
board<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.400> bottom<00:01:53.700> board<00:01:53.850> as<00:01:54.030> well<00:01:54.150> as<00:01:54.210> a

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
board of the bottom board as well as a

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.100 
board of the bottom board as well as a
couple<00:01:54.690> of<00:01:54.720> jumper<00:01:55.140> cables

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.840 

trying<00:02:01.100> to<00:02:01.190> pull<00:02:01.370> them<00:02:01.520> apart<00:02:01.610> here

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.060 

and<00:02:05.360> there<00:02:05.900> was<00:02:06.020> a<00:02:06.050> package<00:02:06.320> of<00:02:06.530> electronics

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
and there was a package of electronics

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:14.010 
and there was a package of electronics
that<00:02:07.159> was<00:02:07.310> sort<00:02:07.520> of<00:02:07.690> wrapped<00:02:08.690> in<00:02:08.899> tape

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.640 

my<00:02:15.020> tops<00:02:15.380> are

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
my tops are

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:23.040 
my tops are
good<00:02:15.769> board<00:02:16.010> there

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:35.750 

let's<00:02:24.050> take<00:02:24.260> off<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:24.620> shield<00:02:24.890> lycÃ©e

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.140 

you

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150

you

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.040 

we'll<00:02:48.660> break<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.080> final<00:02:49.260> connection<00:02:49.620> here

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:03:02.880 

the<00:02:53.050> ribbon<00:02:53.319> cable<00:02:59.640> there's<00:03:00.640> a<00:03:00.730> USB<00:03:01.180> port<00:03:01.890> and

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
the ribbon cable there's a USB port and

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.009 
the ribbon cable there's a USB port and
what<00:03:03.370> looks<00:03:03.519> to<00:03:03.580> be<00:03:03.760> a<00:03:03.790> transformer<00:03:04.510> small

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
what looks to be a transformer small

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.330 
what looks to be a transformer small
transformer<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:07.709> here's<00:03:08.709> the<00:03:09.010> power

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
transformer and here's the power

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:17.780 
transformer and here's the power
transformer<00:03:10.000> circuit<00:03:10.150> board<00:03:10.950> once<00:03:11.950> again<00:03:15.120> and

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
transformer circuit board once again and

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.860 
transformer circuit board once again and
that<00:03:18.790> my<00:03:19.000> friends<00:03:19.390> is<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:19.720> Apple<00:03:20.200> iPhone

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
that my friends is the Apple iPhone

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.730 
that my friends is the Apple iPhone
charger<00:03:22.950> in<00:03:23.950> pieces
