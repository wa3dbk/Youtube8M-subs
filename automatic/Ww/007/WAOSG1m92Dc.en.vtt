00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519

restaurant I please don't get me wrong
but<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.650> just<00:01:08.010> found<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.549> concept<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:09.240> be<00:01:09.360> too

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
but I just found the concept to be too

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.109 
but I just found the concept to be too
much<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.369> thought<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.490> salad<00:01:11.880> bar<00:01:11.970> was

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
much I thought the salad bar was

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.609 
much I thought the salad bar was
phenomenal<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:12.750> think<00:01:13.170> it's<00:01:13.260> probably<00:01:13.409> one<00:01:13.590> of

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
phenomenal I think it's probably one of

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:14.960 
phenomenal I think it's probably one of
the<00:01:13.740> best<00:01:13.860> salad<00:01:14.220> bars<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.580> city<00:01:14.760> of

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
the best salad bars in the city of

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.880 
the best salad bars in the city of
Chicago<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.689> even<00:01:16.439> if<00:01:16.530> you're<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> vegetarian

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
Chicago and even if you're a vegetarian

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.740 
Chicago and even if you're a vegetarian
I<00:01:17.670> would<00:01:17.850> recommend<00:01:18.299> going<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.600> that

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
I would recommend going to that

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.960 
I would recommend going to that
restaurant<00:01:18.900> because<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:20.070> salad<00:01:20.580> bar<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:20.939> a

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
restaurant because the salad bar is a

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.399 
restaurant because the salad bar is a
meal<00:01:21.360> some<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.900> cuts<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.200> meat<00:01:22.290> were

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
meal some of the cuts of meat were

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.929 
meal some of the cuts of meat were
better<00:01:22.590> than<00:01:22.710> others<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.009> don't<00:01:23.670> know<00:01:23.759> how<00:01:23.880> you

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
found it but I found some of the cuts

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.890 
found it but I found some of the cuts
were<00:01:26.220> good<00:01:26.460> some<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.150> them<00:01:27.299> were<00:01:27.420> terrible<00:01:27.780> I

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
were good some of them were terrible I

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.319 
were good some of them were terrible I
love<00:01:28.740> lamb<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.250> thought<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.610> lamb<00:01:29.820> chops<00:01:30.150> were

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.270 
love lamb I thought the lamb chops were
horrible<00:01:30.840> however<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.650> thought<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.009> leg<00:01:32.159> of

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
horrible however I thought the leg of

horrible however I thought the leg of
lamb<00:01:32.369> was<00:01:32.579> very<00:01:32.790> good<00:01:33.030> but<00:01:33.840> just<00:01:33.869> too<00:01:34.259> much

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
lamb was very good but just too much

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.859 
lamb was very good but just too much
food<00:01:34.650> too<00:01:35.189> soon<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.670> thought<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.270> was<00:01:36.390> really
