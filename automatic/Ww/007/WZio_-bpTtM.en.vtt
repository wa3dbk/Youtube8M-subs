diming the Venge right i mean that's a

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.880 
diming the Venge right i mean that's a
really<00:01:09.180> important<00:01:09.630> thing<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:10.080> mean<00:01:10.439> obviously

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
really important thing I mean obviously

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.160 
really important thing I mean obviously
you<00:01:11.070> can<00:01:11.280> say<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.520> come<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.420> X<00:01:12.630> switching

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
you can say I come the X switching

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.929 
you can say I come the X switching
everything<00:01:13.439> but<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.799> still<00:01:14.189> depends<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.729> lot<00:01:14.880> on

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
everything but it still depends a lot on

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.999 
everything but it still depends a lot on
the<00:01:15.150> lock<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.630> mean<00:01:16.110> if<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.259> just<00:01:16.439> hit<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.590> 0<00:01:16.860> ria

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
the lock I mean if you just hit a 0 ria

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.520 
the lock I mean if you just hit a 0 ria
20<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.729> it's<00:01:17.850> about<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.299> defense<00:01:18.930> timing<00:01:19.409> is

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
20 and it's about it defense timing is

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.710 
20 and it's about it defense timing is
really<00:01:19.740> important<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.610> course<00:01:21.240> that's<00:01:21.479> the

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
really important of course that's the

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.630 
really important of course that's the
old<00:01:21.960> lock<00:01:22.140> as<00:01:22.320> well<00:01:22.530> because<00:01:22.830> if<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.070> guy<00:01:23.250> hits

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
old lock as well because if the guy hits

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.460 
old lock as well because if the guy hits
your<00:01:23.880> own<00:01:24.119> your<00:01:24.330> vents<00:01:24.659> then<00:01:24.840> what<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.290> vent

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
your own your vents then what you vent

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.020 
your own your vents then what you vent

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
treasure which is actually pretty easy

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.340

97<00:02:07.439> he's<00:02:07.560> pretty<00:02:07.799> good<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.879> doesn't

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
97 he's pretty good and it doesn't

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.940 
97 he's pretty good and it doesn't
really<00:02:09.239> matter<00:02:09.450> if<00:02:09.690> i<00:02:09.780> get<00:02:09.929> like<00:02:10.080> 71<00:02:10.679> or<00:02:10.830> like

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
really matter if i get like 71 or like

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.059 
really matter if i get like 71 or like
73<00:02:11.550> and<00:02:11.819> so

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
73 and so

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.099 
73 and so
thing<00:02:12.280> because<00:02:12.879> if<00:02:12.999> I<00:02:13.120> will<00:02:13.269> be<00:02:13.420> paying<00:02:13.840> with

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:14.109 
thing because if I will be paying with

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:16.050 
thing because if I will be paying with
like<00:02:14.290> whip<00:02:14.560> and<00:02:15.069> I<00:02:15.370> have<00:02:15.609> to<00:02:15.760> Train<00:02:16.030> like

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
like whip and I have to Train like

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.720 
like whip and I have to Train like
defense<00:02:16.659> or<00:02:16.900> attack<00:02:17.019> which<00:02:17.469> probably<00:02:17.829> is

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
defense or attack which probably is

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.929 
defense or attack which probably is
going<00:02:18.909> to<00:02:18.999> be<00:02:19.120> like<00:02:19.329> attack<00:02:19.829> so<00:02:20.829> you<00:02:21.700> know<00:02:21.819> it

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:21.939 
going to be like attack so you know it

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:23.039 
going to be like attack so you know it
doesn't<00:02:22.060> really<00:02:22.239> matter<00:02:22.420> if<00:02:22.629> I<00:02:22.689> get<00:02:22.810> a<00:02:22.840> couple

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
doesn't really matter if I get a couple

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:25.619 
doesn't really matter if I get a couple
levels<00:02:23.439> above<00:02:23.859> 70<00:02:24.370> because<00:02:24.790> you<00:02:25.269> know<00:02:25.389> as<00:02:25.420> long

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
levels above 70 because you know as long

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:27.420 
levels above 70 because you know as long
as<00:02:25.840> i<00:02:25.930> get<00:02:25.989> 90<00:02:26.379> nice<00:02:26.530> rank<00:02:26.829> that<00:02:26.980> that's<00:02:27.249> my

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
as i get 90 nice rank that that's my

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.869 
as i get 90 nice rank that that's my
main<00:02:28.389> priority<00:02:28.719> same<00:02:29.469> with<00:02:29.709> vengeance<00:02:30.219> so

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
main priority same with vengeance so

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:32.399 
main priority same with vengeance so
it's<00:02:31.000> probably<00:02:31.150> going<00:02:31.389> to<00:02:31.480> be<00:02:31.569> a<00:02:31.959> lot<00:02:32.349> of

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:32.409 
it's probably going to be a lot of

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:34.440 
it's probably going to be a lot of
strength<00:02:32.799> training<00:02:33.099> and<00:02:33.459> I<00:02:33.790> love<00:02:34.030> mates

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450

training in the next couple of videos

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.690 
training in the next couple of videos
and<00:02:37.120> I<00:02:38.019> don't<00:02:38.200> know<00:02:38.290> like<00:02:38.530> everything<00:02:39.519> that

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
and I don't know like everything that

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.670 
and I don't know like everything that
the<00:02:39.969> trench<00:02:40.299> is<00:02:40.480> like<00:02:40.629> my<00:02:40.810> main<00:02:41.109> priority

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:44.469 
because if i get Finch that means that i

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:46.140
