now and I think that's what's going to
take<00:00:48.149> in<00:00:48.420> Jason<00:00:48.840> Terry<00:00:49.079> along<00:00:49.379> with<00:00:49.530> Paul

that have been through this before I

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.709

him<00:01:03.510> involved<00:01:03.840> on<00:01:04.110> offense<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.680> he<00:01:04.769> said<00:01:05.129> no

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
him involved on offense and he said no

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.130 
him involved on offense and he said no
the<00:01:05.939> most<00:01:06.150> important<00:01:06.570> thing<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.930> taking

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
the most important thing is taking

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.020 
the most important thing is taking
advantage<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.159> Knicks<00:01:08.460> when<00:01:08.880> they're

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
advantage of the Knicks when they're

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.330 
advantage of the Knicks when they're
trapping<00:01:09.450> Kevin<00:01:10.140> how<00:01:10.619> much<00:01:10.770> will<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:10.979> help<00:01:11.220> the

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
trapping Kevin how much will it help the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.340 
trapping Kevin how much will it help the
Celtics<00:01:11.909> if<00:01:12.090> they<00:01:12.240> do<00:01:12.299> this<00:01:12.630> well<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.140> think

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
Celtics if they do this well I think

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.950 
Celtics if they do this well I think
Molly<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:14.130> Doc<00:01:14.460> Rivers<00:01:14.670> point<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.570> thing<00:01:15.810> that

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
Molly to Doc Rivers point the thing that

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.600 
Molly to Doc Rivers point the thing that
he<00:01:16.049> doesn't<00:01:16.320> want<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.740> see<00:01:16.920> when<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.400> Knicks

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
he doesn't want to see when the Knicks

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.910 
he doesn't want to see when the Knicks
start<00:01:17.909> trapping<00:01:18.180> Kevin<00:01:19.170> Garnett<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.650> Paul

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
start trapping Kevin Garnett and Paul

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.380 
start trapping Kevin Garnett and Paul
Pierce<00:01:19.979> for<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.549> matter<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.030> low<00:01:21.150> post

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
Pierce for that matter in the low post

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.090 
Pierce for that matter in the low post
is<00:01:21.689> for<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.930> Celtics<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.409> give<00:01:22.619> up<00:01:22.770> on<00:01:22.950> their

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
is for the Celtics to give up on their

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.340 
is for the Celtics to give up on their
offense<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:24.030> think<00:01:24.330> he<00:01:24.479> thinks<00:01:24.750> Doc<00:01:25.140> Rivers

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
offense and I think he thinks Doc Rivers

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.560 
offense and I think he thinks Doc Rivers
does<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:26.340> maybe<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.820> Celtics<00:01:27.180> got<00:01:27.330> away

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
does that maybe the Celtics got away

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.120 
does that maybe the Celtics got away
with<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.810> little<00:01:28.049> bit<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.409> early<00:01:28.799> in<00:01:28.920> Game

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
series consistently started to go down

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.580 
series consistently started to go down
had<00:01:36.479> they<00:01:36.659> not<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:37.079> could<00:01:37.320> have<00:01:37.470> been<00:01:37.530> a

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
had they not that could have been a

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.410 
had they not that could have been a
drastically<00:01:38.280> different<00:01:38.369> story<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.060> start

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
drastically different story to start

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.390 
drastically different story to start
game<00:01:39.869> number<00:01:40.170> four<00:01:40.409> so<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.710> think<00:01:40.890> Doc<00:01:41.220> Rivers

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
game number four so I think Doc Rivers

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.460 
game number four so I think Doc Rivers
wants<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:42.000> see<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.270> Celtics<00:01:42.659> stick<00:01:43.259> with

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
wants to see the Celtics stick with

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.889 
wants to see the Celtics stick with
their<00:01:43.619> low<00:01:43.799> post<00:01:44.040> defense<00:01:44.189> even<00:01:44.759> if<00:01:45.390> the

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
their low post defense even if the

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.660 
their low post defense even if the
Knicks<00:01:46.079> are<00:01:46.259> traffic<00:01:46.710> find<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.130> way<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.310> reverse

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
Knicks are traffic find a way to reverse

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.060 
Knicks are traffic find a way to reverse
the<00:01:47.939> ball<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.420> get<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.659> into<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.020> low<00:01:49.259> post<00:01:49.500> we

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
the ball and get it into the low post we

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.859 
the ball and get it into the low post we
saw<00:01:50.250> Avery<00:01:50.490> Bradley<00:01:51.000> get<00:01:51.149> open<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.479> couple<00:01:51.689> of

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
saw Avery Bradley get open a couple of

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.840 
saw Avery Bradley get open a couple of
times<00:01:52.020> early<00:01:52.409> in<00:01:52.530> Game<00:01:52.710> four<00:01:53.070> with<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.549> couple

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
times early in Game four with a couple

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.550 
times early in Game four with a couple
of<00:01:53.909> easy<00:01:54.119> cuts<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.780> basket<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:55.320> think

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
of easy cuts to the basket I think

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.350 
of easy cuts to the basket I think
that's<00:01:55.770> what<00:01:55.979> Doc<00:01:56.159> Rivers<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.729> really<00:01:57.000> looking

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
that's what Doc Rivers is really looking

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.170 
that's what Doc Rivers is really looking
and<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.500> NBA<00:01:58.830> Sixth<00:01:59.310> Man<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.640> Year<00:01:59.730> JR

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
smith will be back from a one-game

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.260 
smith will be back from a one-game
suspension<00:02:02.400> how<00:02:02.550> is<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.790> going<00:02:02.970> to<00:02:03.090> change

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
suspension how is that going to change

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.630 
suspension how is that going to change
this<00:02:03.570> game<00:02:03.810> for<00:02:04.020> both<00:02:04.170> teams<00:02:04.230> I<00:02:05.040> found<00:02:05.460> it

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
this game for both teams I found it

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.520 
this game for both teams I found it
interesting<00:02:06.000> that<00:02:06.240> Doc<00:02:06.510> Rivers<00:02:06.750> said<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.380> it

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
interesting that Doc Rivers said that it

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.320 
interesting that Doc Rivers said that it
was<00:02:07.710> Raymond<00:02:08.310> Felton<00:02:08.700> who<00:02:08.729> picked<00:02:09.149> up<00:02:09.270> the

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
was Raymond Felton who picked up the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.900 
was Raymond Felton who picked up the
slack<00:02:09.570> for<00:02:09.690> junior<00:02:10.140> Smith<00:02:10.470> anyway<00:02:11.009> so<00:02:11.520> I<00:02:11.550> think

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
slack for junior Smith anyway so I think

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.580 
slack for junior Smith anyway so I think
it'll<00:02:12.030> be<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.210> certainly<00:02:12.810> a<00:02:12.900> bit<00:02:13.140> of<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.350> boost

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
it'll be a certainly a bit of a boost

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.160 
it'll be a certainly a bit of a boost
emotionally<00:02:14.430> for<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.670> next<00:02:14.910> two<00:02:15.270> jet<00:02:15.480> get<00:02:15.780> jr.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
emotionally for the next two jet get jr.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.840 
emotionally for the next two jet get jr.
Smith<00:02:16.710> back<00:02:16.920> knowing<00:02:17.370> they<00:02:17.490> have<00:02:17.670> that

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
Smith back knowing they have that

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.030 
Smith back knowing they have that
advantage<00:02:18.030> coming<00:02:18.930> off<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.350> bench<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:19.800> that

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
advantage coming off the bench and that

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.650 
advantage coming off the bench and that
was<00:02:20.280> something<00:02:20.760> that<00:02:20.910> really<00:02:21.240> gave<00:02:21.480> the

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
was something that really gave the

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.690 
was something that really gave the
Celtics<00:02:22.350> some<00:02:22.530> trouble<00:02:22.890> not<00:02:23.040> as<00:02:23.190> much<00:02:23.370> as<00:02:23.580> I

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
Celtics some trouble not as much as I

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.949 
Celtics some trouble not as much as I
thought<00:02:23.910> it<00:02:24.060> would<00:02:24.090> coming<00:02:24.480> into<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.750> series

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
thought it would coming into the series

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.840 
thought it would coming into the series
but<00:02:25.440> I<00:02:25.500> think<00:02:25.740> JR<00:02:26.040> smith<00:02:26.340> is<00:02:26.490> going<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:26.700> be<00:02:26.820> a

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
but I think JR smith is going to be a

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.210 
but I think JR smith is going to be a
boost<00:02:27.120> for<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.420> next<00:02:27.720> but<00:02:28.140> it's<00:02:28.290> how<00:02:28.620> the

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
boost for the next but it's how the

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.850 
boost for the next but it's how the
celtics<00:02:29.790> continue<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.990> play<00:02:31.170> their<00:02:31.380> defense

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
celtics continue to play their defense

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.160 
celtics continue to play their defense
that<00:02:32.070> will<00:02:32.250> dictate<00:02:32.570> how<00:02:33.570> they're<00:02:33.930> able<00:02:33.959> to

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
that will dictate how they're able to

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.170 
that will dictate how they're able to
control<00:02:34.590> JR<00:02:34.980> smith<00:02:35.220> coming<00:02:35.550> off<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.820> bench<00:02:35.910> I

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
control JR smith coming off the bench I

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.370 
control JR smith coming off the bench I
actually<00:02:36.450> think<00:02:36.630> they've<00:02:36.959> done<00:02:37.080> a<00:02:37.140> pretty

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
actually think they've done a pretty

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.680 
actually think they've done a pretty
good<00:02:37.500> job<00:02:37.680> in<00:02:38.160> this<00:02:38.550> series<00:02:38.760> with<00:02:39.060> JR<00:02:39.390> smith

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
good job in this series with JR smith

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.360 
good job in this series with JR smith
it's<00:02:40.080> been<00:02:40.320> Raymond<00:02:40.709> Felton<00:02:41.040> that's<00:02:41.160> been

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
it's been Raymond Felton that's been

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.160 
it's been Raymond Felton that's been
killing<00:02:41.550> them<00:02:41.820> off<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.060> ball<00:02:42.239> and<00:02:42.480> I<00:02:42.870> think

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
killing them off the ball and I think

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.220 
killing them off the ball and I think
Molly<00:02:43.910> Avery<00:02:44.910> Bradley's<00:02:45.390> got<00:02:45.600> to<00:02:45.750> keep<00:02:46.020> his

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
Molly Avery Bradley's got to keep his

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.010 
Molly Avery Bradley's got to keep his
head<00:02:46.380> up<00:02:46.440> be<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.520> not<00:02:47.730> get<00:02:48.000> down<00:02:48.239> when<00:02:48.660> he<00:02:48.870> has

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
head up be and not get down when he has

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.750 
head up be and not get down when he has
the<00:02:49.200> ball<00:02:49.230> offensively<00:02:49.800> because<00:02:50.250> Doc<00:02:50.580> Rivers

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
the ball offensively because Doc Rivers

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.880 
the ball offensively because Doc Rivers
said<00:02:51.150> Avery<00:02:51.840> Bradley<00:02:52.260> against<00:02:52.530> Raymond

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
said Avery Bradley against Raymond

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.500 
said Avery Bradley against Raymond
Felton<00:02:53.280> has<00:02:53.459> been<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.760> key<00:02:53.940> in<00:02:54.090> this<00:02:54.239> series

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
Felton has been the key in this series

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.660 
Felton has been the key in this series
and<00:02:54.900> I<00:02:55.200> think<00:02:55.470> you<00:02:55.739> know<00:02:55.830> for<00:02:55.860> Avery<00:02:56.280> Bradley

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
and I think you know for Avery Bradley

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.030 
and I think you know for Avery Bradley
maybe<00:02:56.880> to<00:02:57.000> get<00:02:57.120> going<00:02:57.480> offensively<00:02:57.830> would<00:02:58.830> be

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
maybe to get going offensively would be

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.010 
maybe to get going offensively would be
a<00:02:59.070> big<00:02:59.400> boost<00:02:59.580> for<00:02:59.850> the<00:02:59.940> Celtics<00:03:00.360> Avery

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
a big boost for the Celtics Avery

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.479 
a big boost for the Celtics Avery
Bradley<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.590> Celtics<00:03:01.830> will<00:03:02.220> look<00:03:02.340> to

Bradley and the Celtics will look to
