awesome it's so pure as you said it's

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.330 
awesome it's so pure as you said it's
all<00:00:45.690> physical<00:00:46.140> modeling<00:00:46.590> so<00:00:46.770> it's<00:00:46.890> really

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
all physical modeling so it's really

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.670 
all physical modeling so it's really
really<00:00:47.610> interesting<00:00:48.080> for<00:00:49.080> the<00:00:49.200> fact<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.530> you

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
really interesting for the fact that you

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.130 
really interesting for the fact that you
can<00:00:49.860> customize<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:51.000> guitar<00:00:51.420> more<00:00:51.690> than<00:00:51.870> any

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
can customize this guitar more than any

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.580 
can customize this guitar more than any
other<00:00:52.380> guitar<00:00:52.739> right<00:00:53.520> as<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.330> know<00:00:54.590> the

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
other guitar right as you know the

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.440 
other guitar right as you know the
controls<00:00:56.040> here<00:00:56.340> are<00:00:56.580> now<00:00:56.910> in<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.150> Edit<00:00:57.420> Page

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
controls here are now in the Edit Page

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.960 
controls here are now in the Edit Page
they<00:01:00.450> can<00:01:01.320> control<00:01:01.770> parameters<00:01:02.730> by<00:01:02.910> the

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
they can control parameters by the

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.510 
they can control parameters by the
string<00:01:04.369> you<00:01:05.369> can<00:01:05.550> create<00:01:06.080> actions<00:01:07.080> here<00:01:07.520> like

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
string you can create actions here like

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.969 
string you can create actions here like
this<00:01:08.820> will<00:01:09.090> control<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.570> vertical<00:01:09.979> movement

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
this will control the vertical movement

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.670 
this will control the vertical movement
of<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.220> string<00:01:11.630> the<00:01:12.630> B<00:01:12.840> will<00:01:13.140> control<00:01:13.470> like

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
of the string the B will control like

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.950 
of the string the B will control like
the<00:01:14.119> horizontal<00:01:15.119> effect<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.660> stream

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
the horizontal effect of a stream

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.840 
the horizontal effect of a stream
creating<00:01:16.229> harmonics<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.130> can<00:01:17.280> couple<00:01:17.580> the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
creating harmonics you can couple the

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.210 
creating harmonics you can couple the
tools<00:01:18.119> like<00:01:18.450> super<00:01:18.899> interesting<00:01:19.440> effects<00:01:20.070> you

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
tools like super interesting effects you

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.920 
tools like super interesting effects you
can<00:01:20.340> get<00:01:20.520> from<00:01:20.790> so<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.060> can<00:01:21.210> get<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.509> warp<00:01:21.720> the

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
can get from so you can get to warp the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.600 
can get from so you can get to warp the
sounds<00:01:22.560> like<00:01:22.740> this

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.109 

just<00:01:27.000> by<00:01:27.150> tweaking<00:01:27.420> it

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.260 

cycles<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.320> know<00:01:31.439> beyond<00:01:31.829> an<00:01:31.950> acoustic<00:01:32.520> more

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
cycles you know beyond an acoustic more

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.330 
cycles you know beyond an acoustic more
especially<00:01:33.810> more<00:01:34.289> specifically<00:01:34.829> because<00:01:35.189> it

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
especially more specifically because it

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.450 
especially more specifically because it
now<00:01:35.549> has<00:01:35.689> the<00:01:37.850> effects<00:01:38.850> section<00:01:39.030> here<00:01:39.450> which

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
now has the effects section here which

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.520 
now has the effects section here which
follows<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.670> pattern<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:42.299> all<00:01:42.960> products

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
follows the pattern that all products

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.190 
follows the pattern that all products
are<00:01:43.710> having<00:01:44.250> for<00:01:44.490> applied<00:01:44.939> acoustics<00:01:45.450> they're

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
are having for applied acoustics they're

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.859 
are having for applied acoustics they're
now<00:01:46.619> coming<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.219> effect<00:01:47.579> section<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.630> is

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
now coming to the effect section this is

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.569 
now coming to the effect section this is
for<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.530> acoustic<00:01:50.270> strong<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:52.219> now<00:01:53.219> it<00:01:53.399> has

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
for the acoustic strong and now it has

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:54.410 
for the acoustic strong and now it has
three<00:01:53.909> modes

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
three modes

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.109 
three modes
I'll<00:01:55.049> go<00:01:55.289> straight<00:01:55.560> at<00:01:55.859> this<00:01:56.130> hours<00:01:56.609> I've<00:01:56.880> been

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
I'll go straight at this hours I've been

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.480 
I'll go straight at this hours I've been
using<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.569> clipper<00:01:57.869> mode<00:01:58.079> which<00:01:59.039> allows<00:01:59.310> me

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
using the clipper mode which allows me

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.880 
using the clipper mode which allows me
to<00:01:59.549> play<00:01:59.819> it<00:01:59.880> freely

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.400 

but<00:02:06.460> also<00:02:06.640> there's<00:02:06.909> a<00:02:07.000> guitar<00:02:07.180> mode<00:02:07.600> here<00:02:08.020> that

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
but also there's a guitar mode here that

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.260 
but also there's a guitar mode here that
I<00:02:08.440> can<00:02:08.710> activate<00:02:09.310> and<00:02:09.700> he<00:02:09.789> goes<00:02:10.060> to<00:02:10.090> the

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
I can activate and he goes to the

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.940 
I can activate and he goes to the
strumming<00:02:10.780> mode<00:02:10.959> if<00:02:11.440> you're<00:02:11.620> not<00:02:11.740> familiar

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
strumming mode if you're not familiar

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.850 
strumming mode if you're not familiar
with<00:02:12.280> that<00:02:12.430> you<00:02:13.300> know<00:02:13.420> it's<00:02:13.600> just<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:14.770> ability

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
with that you know it's just the ability

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.050 
with that you know it's just the ability
to<00:02:15.190> use<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:16.540> frets<00:02:16.870> and<00:02:17.230> strum<00:02:18.040> it<00:02:18.250> so<00:02:18.850> I'm

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
to use the frets and strum it so I'm

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:34.390 
to use the frets and strum it so I'm
using<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.480> frets<00:02:19.690> to<00:02:19.870> compose<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.319> chords

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.640 

so<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:35.490> can<00:02:35.640> create<00:02:35.850> the<00:02:36.090> action<00:02:36.810> this<00:02:37.530> is

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
so you can create the action this is

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.440 
so you can create the action this is
power<00:02:37.890> cord<00:02:38.220> let<00:02:38.400> me<00:02:38.490> get<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:38.820> a<00:02:38.880> more

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
power cord let me get you a more

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.690 
power cord let me get you a more
expressive<00:02:39.870> sound<00:02:40.260> here<00:02:40.560> there<00:02:40.830> you<00:02:40.920> go

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.190 

they're<00:02:46.700> gonna<00:02:46.820> do<00:02:47.180> all<00:02:47.210> the<00:02:47.510> mute<00:02:47.750> see<00:02:48.020> you

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
they're gonna do all the mute see you

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:56.740 
they're gonna do all the mute see you
know<00:02:48.320> just<00:02:48.590> like<00:02:48.710> a<00:02:49.240> real<00:02:50.240> player

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.680 

in<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:56.930> destruction

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.310 

so<00:03:03.350> it's<00:03:03.500> really<00:03:03.680> nice<00:03:03.950> and<00:03:04.880> it<00:03:05.120> will<00:03:05.300> also<00:03:05.840> now
