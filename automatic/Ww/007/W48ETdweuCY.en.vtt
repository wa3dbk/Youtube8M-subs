review<00:00:07.600> on<00:00:07.779> my<00:00:07.870> new<00:00:07.990> balisong<00:00:08.559> we<00:00:08.740> got<00:00:08.920> it<00:00:09.460> is<00:00:09.670> a

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:09.700 
review on my new balisong we got it is a

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.110 
review on my new balisong we got it is a
Jaguar<00:00:10.599> now<00:00:11.440> I<00:00:11.860> know<00:00:12.070> probably<00:00:12.519> some<00:00:12.969> of<00:00:13.000> you

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:13.120 
Jaguar now I know probably some of you

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.119 
Jaguar now I know probably some of you
think<00:00:13.389> this<00:00:13.599> is<00:00:13.629> a<00:00:13.780> Jaguar<00:00:14.290> classic<00:00:14.799> but<00:00:14.980> it's

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:15.129 
think this is a Jaguar classic but it's

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:17.310 
think this is a Jaguar classic but it's
actually<00:00:15.280> not<00:00:15.730> it<00:00:16.480> looks<00:00:16.630> almost<00:00:17.050> identical

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:17.320 
actually not it looks almost identical

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.109 
actually not it looks almost identical
but<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:20.050> blade<00:00:20.349> is<00:00:20.619> a<00:00:20.650> bit<00:00:20.920> different<00:00:21.220> but<00:00:22.029> I

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:22.119 
but the blade is a bit different but I

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:23.519 
but the blade is a bit different but I
really<00:00:22.359> think<00:00:22.390> that's<00:00:22.660> the<00:00:22.869> only<00:00:22.900> different

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:23.529 
really think that's the only different

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.630 
really think that's the only different
it<00:00:24.490> still<00:00:24.789> got<00:00:24.939> rivets<00:00:25.920> not<00:00:26.920> screw<00:00:27.250> so<00:00:27.460> that's

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
it still got rivets not screw so that's

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.779 
it still got rivets not screw so that's
good<00:00:28.439> yeah<00:00:29.439> I<00:00:29.529> think<00:00:29.830> the<00:00:29.890> only<00:00:30.009> difference<00:00:30.429> is

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:30.789 
good yeah I think the only difference is

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.810 
good yeah I think the only difference is
to<00:00:31.509> bleed<00:00:31.839> it<00:00:32.200> looks<00:00:32.500> different<00:00:32.950> but<00:00:33.550> this<00:00:33.670> one

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
to bleed it looks different but this one

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.790 
to bleed it looks different but this one
says<00:00:34.090> jag<00:00:34.480> we're<00:00:34.750> on<00:00:34.840> that<00:00:34.870> alone<00:00:35.200> I<00:00:35.560> don't

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:30.180 

yeah<00:01:25.740> um<00:01:26.740> I<00:01:28.260> think<00:01:29.260> this<00:01:29.560> one<00:01:29.740> will<00:01:29.800> last<00:01:29.860> me<00:01:30.160> a

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
yeah um I think this one will last me a

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.040 
yeah um I think this one will last me a
lot<00:01:30.370> longer<00:01:30.550> another<00:01:31.210> one<00:01:31.330> over<00:01:31.420> lasted<00:01:31.870> three

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050
