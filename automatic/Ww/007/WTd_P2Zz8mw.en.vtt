00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.819
 I liked it today, it 's very important 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.259
 to promote the video and be sure to 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.780

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:14.610
 continue following our issues the 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.289
 subject chosen for today is with the 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.580
 block kicks on the thigh summon lowkick 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.430
 I accompanied him already talking about 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.800
 the look where rafael is looking to hit 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.250
 my thigh looks very interesting 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.410
 where are you going to see that lo kik is near 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.130
 where the weaker song at the end 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.290
 his 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.930
 The musician is very strong in the center. 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.390
 then it is weaker at the ends 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.460
 near the knee and near the hip 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.160
 he is remembering that the next game he is 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.260
 you sit with your foot in the knee 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.899
 also injured the picture you are standing 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.969
 with the foot on the hip bone is also 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.610
 You hurt your foot, so I seek. 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.270
 always train kicks with cinnamon 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.010
 to shoot with cinnamon and mew 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.210
 Half the thigh is down and I think it 's 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.609
 the most interesting is the middle ground 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.769
 interesting you often see the 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.340
 because they do not kick the 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.909
 high leg or lowering playing elbow 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.850
 wrong right is not a way to do 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.590
 which I prefer not to do because of 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.250
 lift a lot of leg you 're going to vote one 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.530
 once only 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.780
 if rafael, for example, is blocking a 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.490
 high kick I here already the second kick 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.869
 I 'm not going to try Marley, I'm going there. 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.880
 stand under it underneath 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.100
 kicking at his supporting leg and 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.990
 knocking him kick here and see that 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.119
 lift a lot of leg I'll get it 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.850
 only support is down there and 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.299
 overthrow him then I want here 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.490
 bourbon where it does not come and expose 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.759
 absorb this cool kick to 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.350
 hold on but I got on my thigh 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.659
 This is something from him. This is his goal. 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.369
 okay so I know here so what I 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.770
 I'll do it here in relation to his kick. 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.430
 I'll get a little projection. 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:00.719
 toward his kick and a slight one 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.759
 Briefly get up on the foot not much because 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.530
 he can on the second occasion is looking for 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.710
 support foot and pass a creeper 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.690
 so he came with a kick I'm going 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.730
 go up a little and meet a 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.510
 I'll kick him because I'll find you one 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.970
 kick him 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.159
 because his kick is very strong in that 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.180
 point where he aimed to finish the 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.500
 kick him here 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.720
 if I catch him find his kick 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.549
 before the legal point I found I arrived 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.939
 here I already get a weaker kick 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:29.720
 then he struck a shot it I went up 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:32.640
 there is a lock 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:36.290
 remembering that here it is still low and there 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.290
 get ready then go and get the kick 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.540
 It's very simple It's not a mystery It 's a 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.860
 brief a small step small advance 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.409
 up the leg 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.360
 I kicked his knee if he kicked over and 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:58.400
 Come grab the thigh with great force and already 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.870
 I'm with the year fruit leg, I mean, no 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.519
 will absorb the full impact of the blow 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:07.160
 then come on, always remember to make a 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:10.280
 block on the body on the head 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.799
 I 'll never let go of this hand here. 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.870
 defend the red of the kick 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:22.340
 they are here with the band and paste 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:24.379
 white so opa very simple hello to 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.569
 same situation when you had the 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:28.879
 If he's going to kick I'll make a 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:31.549
 brief breakthrough and spin a little bit of my 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:33.650
 leg on the side of his kick or 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:38.299
 listen to my muscle part forward 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:40.340
 climb a little foot try to look for the 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.590
 cinnamon that always follows in this 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.780
 region of my cinnamon that is a region 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.730
 very strong here below a more 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.040
 an example of this is by Anderson 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.139
 whistle where he got it and kicked it in the 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.569
 close to the opponent's knee with 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:56.019
 weakest part of his cinnamon, and 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:59.150
 fracturing then when he kicked 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:02.060
 placed in front I will soon advance 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.810
 or just a circle around the knee 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.810
 entitled to a kick from him 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:09.019
 I can see that he raises his toe and I go 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:14.169
 keep going against a kick 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:16.639
 his is in the thigh 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:18.010
 I can still get a good absorption of the 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:22.870
 blow 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.870
 Can I lift a little bit too? 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.160
 It's very simple It does not have much mystery 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.020
 simple you do 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.180
 remember to train this use always 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.410
 shin guard against injury 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.030
 I hope you have enjoyed this
