00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
horses in the trailer and then and that

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:03.980 
horses in the trailer and then and that
you<00:02:02.880> know<00:02:02.970> the<00:02:03.090> core<00:02:03.330> then<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.509> horses<00:02:03.810> go<00:02:03.930> to

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
you know the core then the horses go to

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.570 
you know the core then the horses go to
jump<00:02:04.229> then<00:02:04.440> you<00:02:04.560> get<00:02:04.680> one<00:02:04.890> down<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.340> before

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
jump then you get one down and before

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.680 
jump then you get one down and before
you<00:02:05.640> know<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:05.910> got<00:02:05.970> a<00:02:06.060> whole<00:02:06.240> bunch<00:02:06.420> down

so<00:02:07.649> another<00:02:08.009> trick<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.369> learned<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.700> was<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.820> wire

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
so another trick I learned it was a wire

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.300 
so another trick I learned it was a wire
their<00:02:09.239> mouth<00:02:09.390> shut<00:02:09.709> you<00:02:10.709> run<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.890> horse<00:02:11.130> miss

their mouth shut you run a horse miss

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.590 
their mouth shut you run a horse miss
you<00:02:11.489> take<00:02:12.420> baling<00:02:12.810> wire<00:02:13.489> usually<00:02:14.489> could<00:02:15.330> keep

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
you take baling wire usually could keep

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.960 
you take baling wire usually could keep
a<00:02:15.720> halter<00:02:16.050> on<00:02:16.080> them<00:02:16.320> and<00:02:17.160> that<00:02:17.280> corner<00:02:17.670> ring<00:02:17.820> on

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
a halter on them and that corner ring on

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.699 
a halter on them and that corner ring on
the<00:02:18.030> halter<00:02:18.209> you<00:02:18.390> wire<00:02:18.720> your<00:02:18.750> baling<00:02:19.440> wire<00:02:19.470> off

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
the halter you wire your baling wire off

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.410 
the halter you wire your baling wire off
and<00:02:19.860> then<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:20.040> Dahlia<00:02:20.280> tight<00:02:20.760> ran<00:02:21.300> that

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
and then you Dahlia tight ran that

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.670 
and then you Dahlia tight ran that
horse's<00:02:21.780> mouth<00:02:21.959> so<00:02:22.170> we<00:02:22.230> can't<00:02:22.440> open<00:02:22.650> that
