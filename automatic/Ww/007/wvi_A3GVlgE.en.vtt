00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:08.880
 Hi everyone Thank you for always watching the website and doing the video 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:14.460
 This time 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:16.810
 In the specific practice methods also stroke but we will continue to talk about stroke 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:22.060
 Some variation 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:26.110
 Let's talk about the strokes and talk about strokes 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:28.980
 I have something to do but how are you playing 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.660
 8 Use the wrist 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.870
 Celebration method 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.270
 With the elbow 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:41.020
 Starting from the market 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:42.350
 I think that there are two ways to pull, but when using that wrist, it is a fine time or 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.500
 That early 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.670
 That kind of stroke 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.860
 At the time of 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.770
 I think it is convenient Starting from the article again 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:57.900
 When the powerful stroke If you play 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:01:00.990
 I will demonstrate that power Both are the best if I can 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:05.100
 This language without its language 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:06.870
 I say if the wind to say tackle Once In addition to its either now play 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.360
 I guess it's not like that 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:18.420
 First of all in the basic part of the four-line poem 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:19.960
 4 seconds to I'd patterns Tteyuu I think you know everyone 12,342,234 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.400
 To the 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:27.270
 I will try it with only the down stroke in the four-line poem 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.270
 1234 weeks 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.810
 7 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.030
 me 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:46.420
 In addition it has an up stroke in the same way as 1234 knee 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.420
 me 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.420
 me 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:02.170
 In many cases , I think it will feel like you 're going to get stuck 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:06.650
 It feels like picking a string with yeah yeah 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:13.350
 I think that you will be able to listen to low smoothly as you go 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:15.710
 Because I think that there is very little case that you play only with the up stroke 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.590
 In return of downstroke 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:23.330
 Go against the between the pick 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:26.120
 It's up when you play with the feeling that it will go back to its return rather than dry 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:31.480
 In I think that one stroke is not it easy to play the 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.480
 I will go downstroke and upstroke combinations 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.069
 Hmm 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.069
 me 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.819
 wh 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:50.890
 Only the last part was an upstroke 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.890
 down gate down down down 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:58.170
 To further 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:03:00.310
 Up and down up and down this time with progress 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.450
 Let's pull it out, you see 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.450
 4th place 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:20.990
 I think that it comes so play evenly 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.370
 If you can get up to here right away , why not grow up Maurice ? 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:26.750
 I think so 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:31.580
 Also in the beginning it is almost always that you can not play as you think 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:33.090
 I think I guess I 'm getting used to it more than I learn 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.450
 Have a cold 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.340
 I 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:41.420
 If you become familiar with the guitar so that you can practice the game that fun 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:45.330
 I think I'm not good 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:47.310
 If you go further 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:52.050
 Accent the stroke 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:54.950
 There is a way to live somewhere else to emphasize the rhythm and eat, but some of them 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.950
 We introduce 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.950
 1 tooth e 4 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.670
 Hmm 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.670
 me 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.220
 ame 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.220
 Have 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:20.910
 Well 100 people 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:26.820
 So I pulled a little harder, but doing so will create a rhythm in the song 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:27.360
 Also, those who play and talk are very easy to sing because they sing too 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.490
 I wonder if 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:35.599
 It seems like it should be easy to take the rhythm 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:35.599
 Let's try some kind of kind of feeling like this 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.750
 Cormorants Dzun 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.120
 7 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.810
 me 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.810
 me 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:52.159
 me 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:15.130
 Is playing to what the wind come and I the 95 not only to some extent or say the music up to here 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:16.480
 Though I think that becomes the wind Tteyuu'm not Kawakan little by little from the basic ones 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.689
 If you do 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:22.449
 Down stroke 

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:24.040
 Aps and six- point deep fried 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:27.289
 Because it is different 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:32.089
 If me so open to hear you say so 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:33.770
 It is said that you will be able to enjoy and work without being tied to that sign or theory 

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:36.430
 I think so 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:42.210
 Last but not least 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:46.259
 We explain in cutting and other videos, but it is Mute that mute 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:50.100
 Turn off the sound of Te It is meaning mute Tteyuu because cutting is off the sound 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:53.330
 Or its small and I'd such me specific person in the sense that I There is also a kind of how to play 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.330
 I'm doing a little bit 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:06:15.560
 Boo ãƒ¼ 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:24.670
 What 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.729
 Tteyuu wear a sound I cutting 

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:31.420
 By you are dressed the way towards the Koch 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:35.780
 You can stop this little gas and good sound when you hold it down 

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:41.230
 Ata further and use this kind of method 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:41.230
 The variation of the image will spread, so that is the last mute 

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.110
 While the sun is rising 

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:05.850
 I will use buber bath light 

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:19.180
 Shoo say 

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:25.640
 me 

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:28.600
 The first is the vaguely felt in the Fu it 's such a've got a lot of how to play with the feeling that 

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:34.810
 I think it's ok if you can 

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:39.220
 Each one comes in kind and it's a lesson book or a dvd, so it's a good idea 

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:40.770
 Please try steadyly one by one while watching and listening 

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:48.139
 This time 

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:48.139
 Thank you for watching it was about stroke that practice method variation
