00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.470
 ah 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.579
 let's start with one the other the 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.499
 we leave cover 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.230
 and now we have to put this is going to be 

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:46.420
 a trick in the shape of a torpedo 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.129
 elongated we have to put a 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.750
 little bit of flour on the table but 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:51.670
 neither is it outrageous 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.329
 emotions I'm touching it a little bit 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.870
 to see how sticky it is 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.790
 before lifting the wing it took off more 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.260
 fire on all sides 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.570
 so as not to tear it when there were 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.280
 up 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.810
 and now for the nice side that I have 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.930
 there I turn the seal 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.610
 land 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.200
 I give a couple of laps to make sure 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.210
 that has hit us this is what I have 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.590
 what to do now is the triangle 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.960
 important when you make the triangle 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.730
 that the sides overlap that fits us well 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.230
 brown that we make a triangle 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.850
 very wide it will cost us much more to form 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.430
 we want it a triangle rather 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.590
 narrow and when we bring the side 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.970
 we want to bring it with angle and everything 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.610
 whole do not go through only the 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.530
 center we want to bring it all whole ay 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.479
 this is important is where the 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.580
 students sometimes it is less and less to climb 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.200
 straight or I just go up a bit 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.270
 ok and now I have noticed that I have been 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.860
 stuck a little there I never let the 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.660
 mass sticks to me I never forget about it 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.729
 I'm always super pending for 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.800
 do not crush the just a little bit of 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.140
 flour with the scraper is worth and now you see 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.119
 that the other side I'm going to upload 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.860
 overlapping by the first and then as 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.780
 I've done it that way I can already see the 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.880
 directly creating tension there is a 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.009
 puntita is worth I can see the tension there 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.990
 and now on the bottom part a 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.640
 little nothing if there was much to me 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.140
 is going to create a skirt here and then to 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.090
 get very ugly with the brave way is 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.849
 it has gone up a little bit more 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:14.620
 and now comes the most complicated part 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:17.620
 the first the first point is to unite the 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.410
 fingers so do it like that to join the 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.510
 fingers so you put them under the 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.400
 tip and bring her the tip with the 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.849
 fingers still like that because if you do it with 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.260
 your fingers so you are going to mark the roll 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:31.599
 I want you to always keep 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.920
 protected well rolled up very nice and 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.110
 great is worth it now you are going to understand 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.269
 what I'm saying to you right stamp in 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.250
 the edge justito justito in the 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.230
 edge and there's my roll this is the 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.720
 rollito that is like the first the 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.519
 first vertebra of our of our 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.560
 mass is worth the mass has as a point 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.840
 central and it's around that point the 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.209
 we are screwing and twisting doing it 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.980
 delicately creating tension a little bit 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.200
 every time but keeping all the gas 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.060
 inside vale is said to be is formed with 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.890
 silk gloves iron hands in 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.599
 silk gloves for lenses we have to 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.579
 treat the delicate mind and I already have 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.319
 First of all, if I've already done this well, 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.700
 I'm very happy and now comes what 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.010
 next for the following we put the 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.109
 hands so we're going to bring a little bit 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.340
 of mass towards us and then we're going 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:13.270
 to push with the big toes the 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.160
 movement 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.900
 is this the students I make them do 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.270
 this like that in the air for them to go 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.310
 understanding why it is very important that 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.170
 when you bring lamas to you and 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.490
 then he pushes it and scholtès the rest of 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.320
 your fingers do not stay with your hand 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.000
 giving all the gear is worth then 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.430
 I bring more to me the big toes 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.770
 loose now it's your big toe and 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.960
 they go these and pushed a little bit and they do not 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.580
 I push a lot pushes me down if 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.290
 with the big toes pushed down 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.330
 they are going to hit me to turn it off more 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.300
 fat fingers I'm pushing as if 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.950
 let's say like that or be parallel to the table 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.630
 is worth dragging a bit on the 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.070
 table and just a little bit because I'm going to 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.930
 do so many times that every time what 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.670
 I'm going to get to create the tension 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.410
 what I need here is worth it is not about 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.180
 do it a lot because then you 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.530
 loads a large part of the gas that 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.990
 we have and besides you are going to finish 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.750
 hitting courageous I bring more to me and 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:05.050
 pushed I bring more towards me and pushed 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.400
 I bring more to myself and pushed and this already 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.960
 I do not know if you see it there but it starts to 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.790
 have a pretty pretty tension and 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.230
 nice to note that with this 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.540
 part of the hands I'm getting the 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.880
 little buns if you wanted to leave it with 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.579
 curls so I would do it straight with my hands 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:21.879
 Straight but how do I want to get piquitos 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:25.120
 with the lower part of your hands you see 

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:26.710
 I bring and pushed I bring and pushed if the 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.810
 mass becomes very big and I have the 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.400
 small hands or if you have a mass 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.930
 huge even if you have big hands you 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.409
 it's going to give the same we can do bit to 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:37.300
 bit is worth a bit another bit and 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:39.340
 another little bit like that until we get to the 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.610
 final and when we reach the end the 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.610
 we stick 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:47.710
 and then with a scraper we take it off and 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.810
 we already have it, so it's more 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.000
 there formalita has its tension up 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.680
 it's great wrong then it's more 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.750
 now I would pick it up doing so 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.820
 returning the stretched one that is not taking the 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.620
 pachu ro but putting their hands by 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.230
 under the stretch again and I would have 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.610
 van etón if it is a mass of dough mother 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.230
 I will put the monitor if it is in a 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.120
 tray simply take it placed it 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.010
 the tray but if it's going to go on a panettone 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.270
 get the idea that is the benetton the 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.680
 I raise it I put it in front of me 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.210
 I imagine he is a gentleman and that his feet 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.860
 it's the bottom line between what already gets the 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.360
 first at the feet by the ballet on and you 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.160
 I'm going to turn around and see if I 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.850
 I teach with a monitor that is going to 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:24.370
 be a little easier to imagine 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.770
 it's worth it then I pick it up like this and the bareto 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.530
 I would have to be in sand and then I 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.880
 everything that is first I run and fall if I 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.390
 it falls bad I can catch it like this for the 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:36.310
 puntita and do you and place it and you're done 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.080
 it's so easy to make the form 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.180
 what happens if this only what 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.370
 you do after street passed the first 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.170
 washed and once every time you spam 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.700
 It's going to cost you a lot to come out 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.689
 you have to do it several times then 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.189
 in 

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:50.499
 as we practice for what I said 

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:51.999
 reservation is a small little house to go 

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:53.860
 practicing with her throughout 1 2 or 

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:55.599
 3 days and my recommendation is that once 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.930
 you have made your little curl so beautiful 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:06:01.570
 put your 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.669
 torpedo so cute that is now it gives 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:04.810
 a little bit of grief but the exercise that 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:06.910
 I recommend that you do is that you go back to 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.530
 put the flour you turn around 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:11.470
 nice side upside down and you start to 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.340
 do this exercise again this way 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.199
 now for example I'm going to do it for 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:17.410
 that I leave with rulito I bring them and 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:20.199
 pushed I bring and pushed I bring and pushed 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:21.520
 I bring and pushed when he pushed loose 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:24.009
 These hands did not let them. 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.840
 is churro pushed soft I bring 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:28.389
 I push softly and then fix is ​​that 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.280
 when I bring up the most 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:31.750
 up is worth another failure is very important 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.610
 well when I finished doing that, I 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.840
 put me back forwards is me 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.190
 sounding the oven because it is that I have 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.289
 some wonderful saint baguette 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:41.139
 taking the course of baguettes is 

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:43.389
 deceptive advertising 116 deceptive but it 's 

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:46.440
 well worth subtle subtle advertising I am going to 

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:46.440
 let the steam come out a little 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:51.650
 and now I'm going to close 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.970
 so it is very important when 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.530
 we are lifting the dough towards 

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.870
 we are very important that the dough 

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:58.820
 we pick it up you see how I raise it and 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:00.830
 not that we push it streets as we 

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.270
 we load the albero side is worth if 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.160
 we push the dough is not going to serve us 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:06.020
 nothing you see we do well we serve has 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.180
 that being raised a little the mass and 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.490
 pushed up I raise the dough a little bit and 

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:12.830
 pushed up I raise the dough a little bit and 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:15.410
 he pushed ok and this we practiced 

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:16.880
 how many times do you give a little bit of grief with 

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.229
 a pretty mass with this more with 

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.720
 this is so rich because this bread 

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:22.220
 buff was delicious gives a little bit of pity 

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:25.280
 practice with it but there is no harm 

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:26.509
 choice but to then have 

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.030
 manual dexterity 

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:31.039
 It is very simple I recommend you 

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:32.539
 practice several times and you go to 

00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:34.910
 be impressed by how quickly 

00:07:32.539 --> 00:07:36.889
 your hands begin to obey 

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:39.400
 your brain 

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:39.400
 good luck
