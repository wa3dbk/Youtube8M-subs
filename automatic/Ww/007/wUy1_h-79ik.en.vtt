00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.579
 crazy to see the last time I was in 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.309
 Anita's house diarra and to drink from 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.350
 excused anita says that cats do 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:45.140
 that's because the water is cool and inside 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.140
 What I wonder is when the sand 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.250

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.680

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.800

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.800

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.460
 listen to this is what we will do 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.460

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:27.520
 small drum did not make much noise no 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:29.740
 I can believe you were right if I 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.050
 I was playing his drum and your dad did not 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:34.750
 I could nap 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:37.930

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.409

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.260
