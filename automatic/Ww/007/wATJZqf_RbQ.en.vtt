is<00:00:07.470> on<00:00:07.529> a<00:00:07.680> double<00:00:08.250> fence<00:00:08.519> gate<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:09.450> turtle

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
is on a double fence gate the turtle

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.620 
is on a double fence gate the turtle
it's<00:00:10.410> using<00:00:10.679> redstone<00:00:11.010> currents<00:00:11.490> as<00:00:11.849> a<00:00:11.910> 1.1

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
it's using redstone currents as a 1.1

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.440 
it's using redstone currents as a 1.1
update<00:00:12.809> for<00:00:13.259> Minecraft<00:00:13.549> the<00:00:14.549> gates<00:00:14.940> can<00:00:15.330> now

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
update for Minecraft the gates can now

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.240 
update for Minecraft the gates can now
receive<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:15.900> redstone<00:00:16.199> signal<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:16.949> turn<00:00:17.130> off

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
receive a redstone signal and turn off

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.140 
receive a redstone signal and turn off
and<00:00:17.430> on<00:00:17.550> so<00:00:17.970> don't<00:00:18.210> like<00:00:19.020> such<00:00:19.850> very<00:00:20.850> simple

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
and on so don't like such very simple

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.390 
and on so don't like such very simple
door<00:00:21.359> uses<00:00:21.840> pressure<00:00:22.590> plates<00:00:22.830> as<00:00:22.980> an<00:00:23.100> input

door uses pressure plates as an input

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.359 
door uses pressure plates as an input
I've<00:00:24.210> made<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.539> tutorial<00:00:24.810> on<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.320> single<00:00:25.890> door<00:00:26.070> so

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
I've made a tutorial on a single door so

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.370 
I've made a tutorial on a single door so
check<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.670> at<00:00:26.789> my<00:00:27.060> channel<00:00:27.269> if<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.630> want<00:00:27.660> this

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
check it at my channel if you want this

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.759 
check it at my channel if you want this
is<00:00:28.560> for<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.769> double<00:00:29.070> door<00:00:29.250> so<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.240> uses<00:00:30.599> for<00:00:31.230> the

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
is for a double door so the uses for the

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.010 
is for a double door so the uses for the
door<00:00:31.920> itself<00:00:32.189> would<00:00:32.579> be<00:00:32.610> for<00:00:33.570> mobs<00:00:33.809> and

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
door itself would be for mobs and

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.389 
door itself would be for mobs and
whatnot<00:00:34.350> this<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:34.890> not<00:00:35.040> really<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.280> good

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
whatnot this is not really a good

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.950 
whatnot this is not really a good
security<00:00:35.760> measure<00:00:36.000> as<00:00:36.180> simply<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.660> player

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
security measure as simply the player

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.260 
security measure as simply the player
you<00:00:37.079> can<00:00:37.200> open<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.620> close<00:00:37.649> it<00:00:37.910> however<00:00:38.910> for

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
you can open and close it however for

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.139 
you can open and close it however for
mobs<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.079> perfect<00:00:40.530> as<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.640> doors<00:00:41.910> when

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
mobs this is perfect as the doors when

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.080 
mobs this is perfect as the doors when
completely<00:00:42.809> open<00:00:43.110> don't<00:00:43.440> have<00:00:44.190> any<00:00:44.489> mass<00:00:44.820> at

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
completely open don't have any mass at

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.279 
completely open don't have any mass at
all<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.780> any<00:00:46.350> actual<00:00:47.039> clipping<00:00:47.690> mask<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:49.020> a

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
all and any actual clipping mask so a

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.200 
all and any actual clipping mask so a
mob<00:00:50.190> banker<00:00:50.489> stuck<00:00:50.700> on<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.850> door<00:00:51.000> at<00:00:51.180> all

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
mob banker stuck on the door at all

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.779 
mob banker stuck on the door at all
however<00:00:51.809> when<00:00:51.960> close<00:00:52.770> this<00:00:53.430> completely

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
however when close this completely

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.819 
however when close this completely
closed<00:00:54.059> in<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.329> mobs<00:00:54.570> will<00:00:54.690> get<00:00:54.870> stopped<00:00:55.530> in

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
closed in the mobs will get stopped in

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.369 
closed in the mobs will get stopped in
stock<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.550> uses<00:00:56.789> uses<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.989> this<00:00:58.079> could<00:00:58.260> be

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
stock so it uses uses of this could be

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.160 
stock so it uses uses of this could be
used<00:00:58.590> for<00:00:59.120> sorting<00:01:00.120> out<00:01:00.239> mobs<00:01:00.510> or<00:01:00.750> directing

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
used for sorting out mobs or directing

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.750 
used for sorting out mobs or directing
mobs<00:01:01.350> into<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.710> certain<00:01:01.949> area<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.399> whatnot

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
mobs into a certain area and whatnot

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.090 
mobs into a certain area and whatnot
using<00:01:03.510> water<00:01:03.809> streams<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.350> however<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.860> want

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
using water streams and however you want

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.039 
using water streams and however you want
so<00:01:05.880> we're<00:01:06.000> going<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.210> get<00:01:06.299> on<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.630> broken

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
so we're going to get on to a broken

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.609 
so we're going to get on to a broken
down<00:01:07.170> version<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:07.799> tutorial<00:01:09.200> ok<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.260> we

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
down version of this tutorial ok so we

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.100 
down version of this tutorial ok so we
now<00:01:11.400> have<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.640> broken<00:01:11.880> down<00:01:12.060> version<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.540> the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
now have a broken down version of the

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.750 
now have a broken down version of the
actual<00:01:13.619> door<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.070> we<00:01:14.340> just<00:01:14.460> showed<00:01:14.580> you

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
actual door so that we just showed you

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.109 
actual door so that we just showed you
then<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:15.930> it's<00:01:16.049> very<00:01:16.200> basic<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.549> may<00:01:17.909> look<00:01:18.030> a

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
then so it's very basic it may look a

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.490 
then so it's very basic it may look a
bit<00:01:18.150> complex<00:01:18.509> we<00:01:18.689> will<00:01:18.810> go<00:01:18.930> over<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.200> step<00:01:19.380> by

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
bit complex we will go over to step by

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.910 
bit complex we will go over to step by
step<00:01:20.090> it's<00:01:21.090> quite<00:01:21.210> as<00:01:21.360> its<00:01:21.570> bill<00:01:21.750> itself<00:01:22.110> so

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
step it's quite as its bill itself so

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.950 
step it's quite as its bill itself so
right<00:01:23.130> over<00:01:23.310> here<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.670> if<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.090> completely<00:01:24.720> broken

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
right over here I if a completely broken

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.050 
right over here I if a completely broken
down<00:01:25.110> version<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.799> only<00:01:26.009> one<00:01:26.400> half<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.909> it

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
down version this is only one half of it

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.990 
down version this is only one half of it
completely<00:01:27.360> one<00:01:27.780> half<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.439> gate<00:01:29.000> and

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
completely one half of the gate and

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.149 
completely one half of the gate and
we'll<00:01:30.240> show<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.450> how<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.900> works<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.439> pretty

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
we'll show you how it works so pretty

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.950 
we'll show you how it works so pretty
much<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.880> gates<00:01:33.090> will<00:01:33.329> turn<00:01:33.509> off<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.840> on

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
much that the gates will turn off and on

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.440 
much that the gates will turn off and on
base<00:01:34.290> in<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.500> eighth<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.920> pulse<00:01:35.579> directly<00:01:35.820> into

trying to hide the wiring we're not

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.819 
trying to hide the wiring we're not
going<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.810> send<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.110> signal<00:01:46.259> into<00:01:46.590> them<00:01:46.710> we're

going to send a signal into them we're

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.310 
going to send a signal into them we're
gonna<00:01:46.890> send<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.220> seat<00:01:47.479> behind<00:01:48.479> them<00:01:48.869> so<00:01:49.140> this

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
gonna send a seat behind them so this

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.350 
gonna send a seat behind them so this
point<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.590> here<00:01:49.799> top<00:01:50.130> gate<00:01:50.340> gets<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.180> signal

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
point of here top gate gets a signal

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.600 
point of here top gate gets a signal
behind<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.960> from<00:01:52.170> him<00:01:52.290> this<00:01:52.380> way<00:01:52.619> here<00:01:52.979> the

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
behind it from him this way here the

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.340 
behind it from him this way here the
bottom<00:01:53.909> gate<00:01:54.060> could<00:01:54.600> signal<00:01:54.930> from<00:01:55.020> below<00:01:55.320> from

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
bottom gate could signal from below from

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.560 
bottom gate could signal from below from
the<00:01:55.770> bottom<00:01:56.130> block<00:01:56.280> over<00:01:56.549> there<00:01:56.759> it's<00:01:57.299> quite

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
the bottom block over there it's quite

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.959 
the bottom block over there it's quite
simple<00:01:57.979> and<00:01:58.979> working<00:01:59.399> down<00:01:59.520> like<00:01:59.670> this<00:01:59.759> it's

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
simple and working down like this it's

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.370 
simple and working down like this it's
quite<00:02:00.119> easy<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.390> understand<00:02:00.869> what<00:02:01.079> actually

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
quite easy to understand what actually

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.010 
quite easy to understand what actually
happens<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:01.950> content<00:02:02.250> off<00:02:02.399> then<00:02:03.210> on<00:02:03.360> and

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
happens that content off then on and

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.260 
happens that content off then on and
also<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.409> can<00:02:04.530> use<00:02:04.560> force<00:02:04.829> plates<00:02:05.009> as<00:02:05.159> well<00:02:05.340> so

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
also you can use force plates as well so

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.850 
also you can use force plates as well so
we're<00:02:06.390> going<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.570> get<00:02:06.659> over<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:07.380> building<00:02:07.740> it

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
we're going to get over to building it

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.169 
we're going to get over to building it
now<00:02:07.979> it's<00:02:08.429> quite<00:02:08.580> simple<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:08.879> brush<00:02:09.060> your

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
now it's quite simple to brush your

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.160 
now it's quite simple to brush your
build<00:02:09.450> so<00:02:09.950> might<00:02:10.950> be<00:02:11.039> long<00:02:11.629> in<00:02:12.629> case<00:02:12.870> we<00:02:13.050> have<00:02:13.080> a

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
build so might be long in case we have a

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.059 
build so might be long in case we have a
nice<00:02:13.319> open<00:02:13.680> area

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
nice open area

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.830 
nice open area
work<00:02:14.280> with<00:02:14.519> those<00:02:14.790> just<00:02:15.090> having<00:02:15.359> some<00:02:15.540> area

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
work with those just having some area

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.140 
work with those just having some area
cleared<00:02:16.200> out<00:02:16.379> originally<00:02:16.950> so<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.879> area

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
cleared out originally so the area

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.059 
cleared out originally so the area
itself<00:02:18.420> that<00:02:18.569> will<00:02:18.659> need<00:02:18.810> to<00:02:18.870> dig<00:02:19.049> out<00:02:19.230> is<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.620> 5

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
itself that will need to dig out is a 5

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.270 
itself that will need to dig out is a 5
by<00:02:20.370> 8<00:02:20.609> by<00:02:21.480> 3<00:02:21.510> deep<00:02:22.139> hole<00:02:22.409> and<00:02:22.709> this<00:02:22.889> is<00:02:22.980> just<00:02:23.159> so

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
by 8 by 3 deep hole and this is just so

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.830 
by 8 by 3 deep hole and this is just so
we<00:02:23.310> can<00:02:23.579> base<00:02:23.790> our<00:02:24.030> wiring<00:02:24.299> and<00:02:24.540> there's<00:02:24.719> just

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
we can base our wiring and there's just

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.879 
we can base our wiring and there's just
a<00:02:25.049> nice<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:26.329> easy<00:02:27.329> hole<00:02:27.689> to<00:02:27.870> dig<00:02:28.290> out<00:02:28.469> so<00:02:28.769> you

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:28.889 
a nice and easy hole to dig out so you

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:31.160 
a nice and easy hole to dig out so you
can<00:02:29.010> actually<00:02:29.189> have<00:02:29.519> the<00:02:29.700> wiring<00:02:29.939> and<00:02:30.299> whatnot

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
can actually have the wiring and whatnot

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.559 
can actually have the wiring and whatnot
placed<00:02:31.469> around<00:02:31.620> so<00:02:32.040> I'm<00:02:32.280> so<00:02:32.849> first<00:02:33.120> of<00:02:33.239> all<00:02:33.359> dig

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
placed around so I'm so first of all dig

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.649 
placed around so I'm so first of all dig
you<00:02:34.290> see<00:02:34.469> at<00:02:34.590> once<00:02:34.739> it<00:02:34.889> very<00:02:35.069> long<00:02:35.359> so<00:02:36.359> it's<00:02:36.480> 5

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
you see at once it very long so it's 5

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:41.089 
you see at once it very long so it's 5
by<00:02:36.870> 3<00:02:36.900> by<00:02:37.799> say<00:02:38.250> five<00:02:38.359> wide<00:02:39.530> 8<00:02:40.530> long<00:02:40.829> by<00:02:41.069> three

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
by 3 by say five wide 8 long by three

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.429 
by 3 by say five wide 8 long by three
deep<00:02:41.639> and<00:02:41.879> it's<00:02:42.030> just<00:02:42.180> so<00:02:42.419> I<00:02:42.629> said<00:02:43.019> so<00:02:43.260> we<00:02:43.319> can

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:43.439 
deep and it's just so I said so we can

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:45.770 
deep and it's just so I said so we can
host<00:02:43.650> all<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.099> wiring<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:44.609> support<00:02:45.359> all<00:02:45.510> the

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
host all the wiring and support all the

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.089 
host all the wiring and support all the
setup<00:02:46.739> somewhat<00:02:47.040> not<00:02:47.280> for<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.120> system<00:02:48.450> itself

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
setup somewhat not for the system itself

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.589 
setup somewhat not for the system itself
doesn't<00:02:50.099> take<00:02:50.280> long<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:50.459> market<00:02:50.969> and<00:02:51.209> all<00:02:51.480> of

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
doesn't take long to market and all of

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.170 
doesn't take long to market and all of
you<00:02:51.719> worry<00:02:52.159> he's<00:02:53.159> done<00:02:53.430> mostly<00:02:53.849> underground

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
you worry he's done mostly underground

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.909 
you worry he's done mostly underground
is<00:02:54.510> only<00:02:54.659> the<00:02:54.870> signals<00:02:55.230> that<00:02:55.290> come<00:02:55.439> up<00:02:55.650> so<00:02:55.799> all

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:55.919 
is only the signals that come up so all

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:58.809 
is only the signals that come up so all
the<00:02:56.040> contraption<00:02:56.519> such<00:02:56.699> as<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.909> inverters

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
the contraption such as the inverters

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.059 
the contraption such as the inverters
all<00:02:59.819> done<00:03:00.329> on<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.569> ground<00:03:00.810> and<00:03:01.049> whatnot<00:03:01.319> so<00:03:01.560> we

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
all done on the ground and whatnot so we

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.830 
all done on the ground and whatnot so we
can<00:03:02.280> actually<00:03:02.370> not<00:03:02.639> have<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.209> most<00:03:03.480> of<00:03:03.629> bulk

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
can actually not have the most of bulk

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.360 
can actually not have the most of bulk
of<00:03:03.989> it<00:03:04.079> up<00:03:04.230> grandser<00:03:05.129> said<00:03:05.489> it'll<00:03:05.730> blow<00:03:06.239> ground

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
of it up grandser said it'll blow ground

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:14.720 
of it up grandser said it'll blow ground
easier<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:08.489> figure<00:03:08.730> out<00:03:10.010> so<00:03:11.010> we<00:03:11.189> have<00:03:11.370> now<00:03:11.790> a<00:03:13.730> 5

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
easier to figure out so we have now a 5

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.689 
easier to figure out so we have now a 5
by<00:03:15.030> 8<00:03:15.060> by<00:03:15.599> 3<00:03:15.629> deep<00:03:16.049> hole<00:03:16.370> like<00:03:17.370> I<00:03:17.459> said<00:03:17.579> I've

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:17.699 
by 8 by 3 deep hole like I said I've

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:19.369 
by 8 by 3 deep hole like I said I've
marked<00:03:17.909> it<00:03:18.060> out<00:03:18.180> already<00:03:18.540> so<00:03:18.840> i<00:03:18.870> can<00:03:19.019> get<00:03:19.169> the

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 
marked it out already so i can get the

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:22.610 
marked it out already so i can get the
tutorial<00:03:20.220> straight<00:03:21.019> so<00:03:22.019> we're<00:03:22.139> going<00:03:22.229> to<00:03:22.470> do

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
tutorial straight so we're going to do

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.409 
tutorial straight so we're going to do
is<00:03:22.739> now<00:03:22.889> create<00:03:23.189> a<00:03:23.220> to<00:03:23.430> wipe<00:03:23.639> a<00:03:23.909> thin<00:03:24.209> and<00:03:24.359> very

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:24.419 
is now create a to wipe a thin and very

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:26.780 
is now create a to wipe a thin and very
dead<00:03:24.750> center<00:03:25.079> so<00:03:25.319> you<00:03:25.620> have<00:03:26.280> three<00:03:26.459> blocks<00:03:26.699> on

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
dead center so you have three blocks on

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.599 
dead center so you have three blocks on
each<00:03:26.879> sides<00:03:27.150> at<00:03:27.389> one<00:03:27.569> two<00:03:27.900> three<00:03:28.459> so<00:03:29.459> out<00:03:29.579> of

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
each sides at one two three so out of

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.030 
each sides at one two three so out of
one<00:03:29.849> walk<00:03:30.030> here<00:03:30.359> to<00:03:30.989> look<00:03:31.139> see<00:03:31.319> so<00:03:31.560> making<00:03:31.859> sure

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
one walk here to look see so making sure

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.199 
one walk here to look see so making sure
you<00:03:32.220> pass<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.579> center<00:03:32.879> we're<00:03:33.000> going<00:03:33.150> to

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
you pass the center we're going to

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.920 
you pass the center we're going to
complete<00:03:33.479> this<00:03:33.569> path<00:03:33.780> all<00:03:34.019> the<00:03:34.049> way<00:03:34.169> out<00:03:35.930> like

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
complete this path all the way out like

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.360 
complete this path all the way out like
such<00:03:39.349> instance<00:03:40.349> that<00:03:40.500> we<00:03:40.620> can<00:03:40.739> visualize<00:03:40.889> what

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
such instance that we can visualize what

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.580 
such instance that we can visualize what
we're<00:03:41.519> actually<00:03:41.609> doing<00:03:41.900> and<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.079> very<00:03:43.259> center

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
we're actually doing and the very center

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.420 
we're actually doing and the very center
we<00:03:43.709> want<00:03:43.889> to<00:03:43.979> create<00:03:44.250> a<00:03:44.609> color<00:03:45.030> that<00:03:45.419> goes<00:03:45.479> up

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
we want to create a color that goes up

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.119 
we want to create a color that goes up
like<00:03:47.430> this<00:03:48.379> i'm<00:03:49.379> going<00:03:49.470> to<00:03:49.590> create<00:03:49.709> to<00:03:49.919> hide

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
like this i'm going to create to hide

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.449 
like this i'm going to create to hide
pillar<00:03:51.229> and<00:03:52.229> get<00:03:52.680> rid<00:03:52.799> of<00:03:52.859> stuff<00:03:53.069> off<00:03:53.400> the

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
pillar and get rid of stuff off the

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.349 
pillar and get rid of stuff off the
bottom<00:03:53.669> put<00:03:54.599> your<00:03:54.720> fence<00:03:54.870> gates<00:03:55.139> there<00:03:56.359> like

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
bottom put your fence gates there like

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:00.170 
bottom put your fence gates there like
such<00:03:57.599> and<00:03:58.500> just<00:03:58.650> so<00:03:58.829> we<00:03:58.979> can<00:03:59.099> now<00:03:59.549> have<00:03:59.790> that's

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
such and just so we can now have that's

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.860 
such and just so we can now have that's
good<00:04:00.389> or<00:04:00.680> really<00:04:01.680> like<00:04:01.859> that<00:04:02.509> so<00:04:03.509> now<00:04:03.629> we<00:04:03.719> need

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
good or really like that so now we need

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.119 
good or really like that so now we need
to<00:04:03.900> do<00:04:04.019> the<00:04:04.139> wiring<00:04:04.290> to<00:04:04.590> them<00:04:04.709> so<00:04:04.799> wiring<00:04:05.069> is

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:05.129 
to do the wiring to them so wiring is

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:06.229 
to do the wiring to them so wiring is
quite<00:04:05.280> simple<00:04:05.519> as<00:04:05.639> well<00:04:05.790> so<00:04:05.969> we're<00:04:06.060> going<00:04:06.180> to

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
quite simple as well so we're going to

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.629 
quite simple as well so we're going to
place<00:04:06.389> a<00:04:06.419> block<00:04:06.689> right<00:04:07.049> down<00:04:07.229> here<00:04:07.439> and<00:04:08.340> then

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
place a block right down here and then

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:09.800 
place a block right down here and then
block<00:04:08.879> this<00:04:09.150> so<00:04:09.359> we<00:04:09.419> have<00:04:09.540> it<00:04:09.629> kind<00:04:09.719> of

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
block this so we have it kind of

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.920 
block this so we have it kind of
diagonally<00:04:10.199> going<00:04:10.409> down<00:04:11.599> same<00:04:12.599> thing<00:04:12.780> on<00:04:12.870> the

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
diagonally going down same thing on the

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.170 
diagonally going down same thing on the
other<00:04:12.959> side<00:04:13.049> so<00:04:13.889> it's<00:04:14.250> decides<00:04:14.729> exactly

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
other side so it's decides exactly

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.390 
other side so it's decides exactly
mirrored<00:04:15.900> is<00:04:16.199> anything<00:04:16.620> i<00:04:16.799> wasn't<00:04:17.070> one<00:04:17.219> thing

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
mirrored is anything i wasn't one thing

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.949 
mirrored is anything i wasn't one thing
a<00:04:17.430> slightly<00:04:17.699> different<00:04:17.909> that's<00:04:18.180> the<00:04:18.389> returned

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
a slightly different that's the returned

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.860 
a slightly different that's the returned
wire<00:04:19.229> for<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:19.530> signal<00:04:19.859> up<00:04:19.979> here<00:04:20.659> so<00:04:21.659> you<00:04:21.750> can

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
wire for the signal up here so you can

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.649 
wire for the signal up here so you can
place<00:04:22.049> the<00:04:22.169> pressure<00:04:22.349> plates<00:04:22.620> now<00:04:22.940> so<00:04:23.940> let<00:04:24.599> me

00:04:24.649 --> 00:04:24.659 
place the pressure plates now so let me

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:26.540 
place the pressure plates now so let me
grab<00:04:24.840> the<00:04:24.930> pressure<00:04:25.110> plates<00:04:25.409> and<00:04:26.279> we<00:04:26.340> want<00:04:26.490> to

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
grab the pressure plates and we want to

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.440 
grab the pressure plates and we want to
put<00:04:26.699> it

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
put it

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.300 
put it
one<00:04:27.840> away<00:04:27.930> from<00:04:28.260> the<00:04:28.410> actual<00:04:28.560> door<00:04:28.800> itself<00:04:29.070> so

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
one away from the actual door itself so

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:35.050 
one away from the actual door itself so
right<00:04:29.610> here<00:04:29.850> so<00:04:30.660> one<00:04:30.840> block<00:04:31.020> away<00:04:33.110> like<00:04:34.110> such

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
right here so one block away like such

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.090 
right here so one block away like such
so<00:04:36.060> determining<00:04:36.570> your<00:04:36.660> face<00:04:36.990> doesn't<00:04:37.770> matter

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
so determining your face doesn't matter

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.440 
so determining your face doesn't matter
which<00:04:38.370> way<00:04:38.520> you<00:04:38.550> can<00:04:38.700> do<00:04:38.910> I'm<00:04:39.180> just<00:04:39.240> going<00:04:39.420> to

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
which way you can do I'm just going to

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.210 
which way you can do I'm just going to
do<00:04:39.540> it<00:04:39.600> like<00:04:39.660> this<00:04:39.810> we'll<00:04:40.620> hop<00:04:40.800> the<00:04:40.950> end<00:04:41.070> of<00:04:41.160> the

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
do it like this we'll hop the end of the

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.790 
do it like this we'll hop the end of the
hall<00:04:41.250> and<00:04:41.990> directly<00:04:42.990> under<00:04:43.290> a<00:04:43.350> pressure<00:04:43.500> place

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
hall and directly under a pressure place

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.800 
hall and directly under a pressure place
it<00:04:43.980> directly<00:04:44.070> over<00:04:44.490> here<00:04:44.730> on<00:04:44.910> both<00:04:45.540> sides

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
it directly over here on both sides

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.180 
it directly over here on both sides
we're<00:04:45.990> going<00:04:46.110> to<00:04:46.170> place<00:04:46.320> two<00:04:46.530> blocks<00:04:46.680> like

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
we're going to place two blocks like

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.450 
we're going to place two blocks like
this<00:04:48.170> this<00:04:49.170> is<00:04:49.230> just<00:04:49.530> so<00:04:49.620> we<00:04:49.650> can<00:04:49.890> now<00:04:50.040> receive

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
this this is just so we can now receive

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.380 
this this is just so we can now receive
the<00:04:50.790> wire<00:04:50.970> signal<00:04:51.510> from<00:04:51.720> the<00:04:51.870> blog's<00:04:52.080> itself

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
the wire signal from the blog's itself

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.360 
the wire signal from the blog's itself
the<00:04:54.390> wire<00:04:54.600> will<00:04:54.630> go<00:04:54.900> down<00:04:55.080> or<00:04:55.320> not<00:04:55.470> so<00:04:55.980> on<00:04:56.220> top

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
the wire will go down or not so on top

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.500 
the wire will go down or not so on top
of<00:04:56.430> these<00:04:56.580> both<00:04:56.850> these<00:04:57.000> blocks<00:04:57.240> we<00:04:57.390> need

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
of these both these blocks we need

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.030 
of these both these blocks we need
advice<00:04:57.690> to<00:04:57.990> wire<00:04:58.920> and<00:05:00.320> we<00:05:01.320> linearly<00:05:01.710> start

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
advice to wire and we linearly start

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.860 
advice to wire and we linearly start
connecting<00:05:02.550> them<00:05:02.790> up<00:05:02.880> eventually<00:05:03.180> so<00:05:03.540> now<00:05:03.810> we

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
connecting them up eventually so now we

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.620 
connecting them up eventually so now we
let<00:05:04.650> me<00:05:04.800> press<00:05:05.070> hop<00:05:05.640> on<00:05:05.790> one<00:05:05.940> of<00:05:06.030> them<00:05:06.120> so<00:05:06.270> we'll

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
let me press hop on one of them so we'll

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:07.820 
let me press hop on one of them so we'll
put<00:05:06.780> an<00:05:06.900> item<00:05:07.020> on<00:05:07.200> there<00:05:07.350> you'll<00:05:07.530> notice<00:05:07.800> that

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
put an item on there you'll notice that

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.730 
put an item on there you'll notice that
the<00:05:07.980> extra<00:05:08.190> light<00:05:08.370> up<00:05:08.520> like<00:05:08.700> that<00:05:09.680> so<00:05:10.680> we'll

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
the extra light up like that so we'll

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.020 
the extra light up like that so we'll
grab<00:05:10.920> that<00:05:11.040> out<00:05:11.190> so<00:05:11.340> what<00:05:11.430> we<00:05:11.520> need<00:05:11.610> to<00:05:11.700> do<00:05:11.880> is

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
grab that out so what we need to do is

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.270 
grab that out so what we need to do is
we<00:05:12.390> pistons<00:05:13.080> need<00:05:13.290> to<00:05:13.350> be<00:05:13.440> always<00:05:13.680> active<00:05:14.160> all

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
we pistons need to be always active all

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.310 
we pistons need to be always active all
the<00:05:14.310> doors<00:05:14.580> need<00:05:14.730> to<00:05:14.820> be<00:05:14.970> active<00:05:15.810> at<00:05:15.900> least<00:05:16.110> we

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
the doors need to be active at least we

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.790 
the doors need to be active at least we
need<00:05:16.440> to<00:05:16.500> create<00:05:16.710> a<00:05:18.230> inverter<00:05:19.230> so<00:05:19.440> what<00:05:19.560> we<00:05:19.650> do

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
need to create a inverter so what we do

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.610 
need to create a inverter so what we do
is<00:05:19.830> we<00:05:20.100> run<00:05:20.340> a<00:05:20.370> wire<00:05:20.610> out<00:05:20.880> on<00:05:21.060> both<00:05:21.240> sides<00:05:21.620> into

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
is we run a wire out on both sides into

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.360 
is we run a wire out on both sides into
a<00:05:22.860> block<00:05:23.450> like<00:05:24.450> such<00:05:25.010> and<00:05:26.010> on<00:05:26.130> the<00:05:26.250> edge<00:05:26.340> of

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
a block like such and on the edge of

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.150 
a block like such and on the edge of
this<00:05:26.550> block<00:05:26.790> with<00:05:26.940> motor<00:05:27.090> torch<00:05:28.010> so<00:05:29.010> now<00:05:29.130> that

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 
this block with motor torch so now that

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.790 
this block with motor torch so now that
both<00:05:29.460> signals<00:05:30.420> are<00:05:30.570> now<00:05:30.690> active<00:05:31.140> always<00:05:31.500> and

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
both signals are now active always and

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.360 
both signals are now active always and
then<00:05:32.700> now<00:05:32.940> we<00:05:33.000> bring<00:05:33.330> this<00:05:33.510> torch<00:05:33.780> out<00:05:34.370> while

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
then now we bring this torch out while

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:36.710 
then now we bring this torch out while
on<00:05:35.490> the<00:05:35.640> ground<00:05:35.850> run<00:05:36.000> talk<00:05:36.420> to<00:05:36.540> Nellore

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
on the ground run talk to Nellore

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.240 
on the ground run talk to Nellore
signals<00:05:37.080> active<00:05:37.760> goes<00:05:38.760> back<00:05:38.940> into<00:05:39.240> here<00:05:40.250> with

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
signals active goes back into here with

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.390 
signals active goes back into here with
a<00:05:41.280> torch<00:05:41.550> on<00:05:41.670> top<00:05:42.830> this<00:05:43.830> torture<00:05:44.220> is<00:05:44.280> now

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
a torch on top this torture is now

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.900 
a torch on top this torture is now
turned<00:05:44.640> off<00:05:44.790> so<00:05:45.030> that<00:05:45.060> uses<00:05:45.450> the<00:05:46.790> signal<00:05:47.790> so

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 
turned off so that uses the signal so

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:49.760 
turned off so that uses the signal so
now<00:05:48.060> this<00:05:48.210> the<00:05:48.540> initial<00:05:48.960> signals<00:05:49.410> turned<00:05:49.560> off

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
now this the initial signals turned off

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.010 
now this the initial signals turned off
and<00:05:50.100> now<00:05:50.220> this<00:05:50.340> signals<00:05:50.670> turned<00:05:50.820> off<00:05:51.030> which

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
and now this signals turned off which

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.170 
and now this signals turned off which
will<00:05:52.290> then<00:05:52.440> come<00:05:52.800> up<00:05:52.920> here<00:05:53.070> eventually<00:05:53.130> so<00:05:53.820> sex

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
will then come up here eventually so sex

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.610 
will then come up here eventually so sex
lacks<00:05:54.390> empathy<00:05:54.540> on<00:05:54.750> the<00:05:54.840> side<00:05:55.050> so<00:05:55.290> once<00:05:55.530> we

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
lacks empathy on the side so once we

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.470 
lacks empathy on the side so once we
have<00:05:55.740> a<00:05:55.770> torch<00:05:56.040> from<00:05:56.160> it<00:05:56.310> here<00:05:56.520> we're<00:05:57.300> going<00:05:57.390> to

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:57.480 
have a torch from it here we're going to

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.990 
have a torch from it here we're going to
pull<00:05:57.630> the<00:05:57.720> wire<00:05:57.900> out<00:05:57.930> into<00:05:58.860> a<00:05:58.890> block<00:05:59.160> with<00:05:59.910> the

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
pull the wire out into a block with the

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.880 
pull the wire out into a block with the
torch<00:06:00.210> on<00:06:00.330> top<00:06:00.800> easy<00:06:01.800> done<00:06:03.590> that<00:06:04.590> torch

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:04.890 
torch on top easy done that torch

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.160 
torch on top easy done that torch
becomes<00:06:05.820> handy<00:06:06.150> which<00:06:06.300> will<00:06:06.420> see<00:06:06.570> soon<00:06:06.780> we

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.170 
becomes handy which will see soon we

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.530 
becomes handy which will see soon we
need<00:06:07.380> that<00:06:07.560> actually<00:06:08.040> inverted<00:06:08.490> there<00:06:08.730> to

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:09.540 
need that actually inverted there to

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.900 
need that actually inverted there to
divert<00:06:09.870> the<00:06:10.020> signal<00:06:10.550> horizontally<00:06:11.550> so<00:06:11.700> what

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:11.910 
divert the signal horizontally so what

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:13.790 
divert the signal horizontally so what
happens<00:06:12.180> with<00:06:12.270> a<00:06:12.330> torch<00:06:12.600> is<00:06:12.870> that<00:06:13.380> we<00:06:13.470> can<00:06:13.620> pull

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
happens with a torch is that we can pull

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.220 
happens with a torch is that we can pull
the<00:06:13.920> wire<00:06:14.100> up<00:06:14.310> above<00:06:14.700> the<00:06:14.850> block<00:06:15.060> into<00:06:16.020> the<00:06:16.110> top

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:16.230 
the wire up above the block into the top

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.800 
the wire up above the block into the top
gate<00:06:16.440> like<00:06:16.650> such<00:06:16.890> and<00:06:17.280> on<00:06:18.180> this<00:06:18.270> on<00:06:18.480> the<00:06:18.600> side

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
gate like such and on this on the side

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.080 
gate like such and on this on the side
as<00:06:18.960> well<00:06:19.110> so<00:06:19.380> be<00:06:19.530> pulling<00:06:19.800> it<00:06:19.890> up<00:06:19.980> like<00:06:20.160> that<00:06:20.190> so

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090 
as well so be pulling it up like that so

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.570 
as well so be pulling it up like that so
now<00:06:21.210> that<00:06:21.240> we<00:06:21.450> actually<00:06:21.570> step<00:06:22.350> on<00:06:22.470> it<00:06:22.620> the<00:06:23.340> top

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 
now that we actually step on it the top

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.060 
now that we actually step on it the top
one<00:06:23.790> turns<00:06:24.060> on<00:06:24.330> so<00:06:24.840> the<00:06:25.140> top<00:06:25.350> one<00:06:25.500> turns<00:06:25.740> on<00:06:25.920> why

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:26.070 
one turns on so the top one turns on why

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:27.350 
one turns on so the top one turns on why
the<00:06:26.130> torch<00:06:26.400> to<00:06:26.460> anyone<00:06:26.880> over<00:06:27.060> here<00:06:27.240> which

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 
the torch to anyone over here which

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.860 
the torch to anyone over here which
powers<00:06:27.720> and<00:06:27.960> wire<00:06:28.080> itself<00:06:29.030> simple<00:06:30.030> is<00:06:30.120> up<00:06:30.270> we

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870 
powers and wire itself simple is up we

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.310 
powers and wire itself simple is up we
now<00:06:31.020> need<00:06:31.410> to<00:06:31.470> wonder<00:06:32.040> run<00:06:32.700> the<00:06:32.850> wire<00:06:33.320> into

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:34.320 
now need to wonder run the wire into

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.900 
now need to wonder run the wire into
this<00:06:34.440> block<00:06:34.650> over<00:06:34.920> here<00:06:35.420> just<00:06:36.420> placing<00:06:36.780> a

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:37.910 
this block over here just placing a

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.210 
this block over here just placing a
block<00:06:38.910> like<00:06:39.030> that<00:06:39.680> one<00:06:40.680> box<00:06:40.920> there

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:41.220 
block like that one box there

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:43.200 
block up diagonally like that we need a

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.570 
block up diagonally like that we need a
powder<00:06:43.500> block<00:06:43.770> underneath<00:06:44.240> same<00:06:45.240> thing<00:06:45.390> again

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:46.580 
powder block underneath same thing again
