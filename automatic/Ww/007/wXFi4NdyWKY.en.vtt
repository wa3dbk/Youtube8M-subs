00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello and welcome to my 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.700
 pay attention to update and today i show 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.589
 actually mainly just the things 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.960
 I recently took a legostein 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.420
 Berlin and yes I'll catch you then 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.740
 I would say so too 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.350
 very little that here now in such a 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.410
 all this is already clear 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.449
 sorted and yes so I have me first 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.730
 that's about bigger here 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.619
 as many as I had before because 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.400
 I actually still it just once 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.309
 a whole lot more needed and 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:35.430
 so then here consider the 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:36.899
 Glasteile once in two form these 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.730
 normal transparent and this something 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.500
 I had this darker before 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.750
 Not 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.890
 then this one in purple 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.020
 so that can be determined something 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.110
 beginning once such a Briggs in 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.239
 dark gray because I often times when I 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.949
 and so many 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.539
 it just could not have been like that 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.489
 many of them just had it now 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:03.149
 many times then brought a few slices 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:04.470
 These slates this was the oblique one 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.070
 middle had slipped somehow 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.049
 his 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.880
 I can not do that much now 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.460
 but that's not a problem 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.659
 in the two fours in dark and light gray 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.920
 these leaves partly in light green 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.340
 this little cone is sounding in 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.049
 transparent purple because I already have two 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.189
 had and on which one would have much 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.270
 That's why I have to use 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:31.320
 now again brought two this 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:34.020
 angry because I have the grass once 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.369
 also wants to provide a little bit with flowers 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.479
 So it's not so boring and 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.610
 monotonous from the number then here the 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.759
 twice fourth plan build once 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:48.750
 two plates glue where the whole 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:52.009
 again in the form of partly then here 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:56.759
 these in pink these clips here these 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:58.200
 small even one in dark gray I 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.189
 mainly only in light gray 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.210
 but it had many times in which 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.450
 dark gray could have needed and 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.800
 I did not have that much 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.380
 daniel this olive green 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.360
 which I find very cool is the super 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.460
 ride why now such small details 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.090
 to do in max and yes there I have 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.530
 my whole also caught up here then 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.290
 this once two, partly in the 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.390
 translucent light blue this in 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.500
 transparent more blue and dark blue 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.900
 and this lever are the main ones 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.330
 this part is relative what that is 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.230
 but down there is the lever itself 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.390
 It's cool too and I have it 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.470
 now bought in the whole and then 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.420
 also these few transparent ones here 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.120
 and so much for lego storm that's it 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.090
 everything from above and then have 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.440
 I also have this little little one again 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.360
 part hope love comes he does not set 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.310
 on the lego strong thats all 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.770
 useful parts for example this one here 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.230
 or these headlights from the chambers 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.580
 I never think I have enough 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.260
 once a sender this time also in 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.510
 light gray that was in the lego store unfortunately 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.610
 not in the color but okay now 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.510
 yes, no problem 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:11.370
 and then I have to go there I have to 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:13.520
 Shortly at the window we go these two 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.209
 small sortie boxes are now the 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.340
 are now at the window because the 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:20.340
 I think it's quite chemically stinking 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.350
 okay that's done quickly now 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.970
 Just run out a bit and 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.890
 Yes, I can hold my hand 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:31.290
 are only such small for small parts 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:34.860
 two pieces, we'll see you again 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.300
 back to the desk and so much was 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.650
 it then actually I still have 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.690
 a short question to you now warm 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.750
 this smoke I has recently shown 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.640
 I should start this courage to this 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.050
 tomorrow if I continue building 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.520
 make or want to do problems videos 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.800
 not so much or less 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.690
 surprise then I actually should have 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.940
 no work in progress videos too 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.530
 But yes, I wanted to do that to you 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.090
 ask and then I would say say 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.800
 we'll probably be with you tomorrow 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.800
 new custom and by then look people
