jump block with a rat that or trade with
a<00:03:33.180> rat<00:03:33.330> that<00:03:33.360> turn<00:03:33.750> of<00:03:34.620> course<00:03:34.980> he<00:03:35.100> has<00:03:35.190> to<00:03:35.280> win

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
a rat that turn of course he has to win

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.210 
a rat that turn of course he has to win
a<00:03:35.430> short<00:03:35.700> game<00:03:35.940> so<00:03:36.269> and<00:03:36.930> max<00:03:37.470> can't<00:03:37.769> block<00:03:38.040> on

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
a short game so and max can't block on

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.470 
a short game so and max can't block on
the<00:03:38.280> way<00:03:38.400> back<00:03:38.550> because<00:03:38.880> Todd<00:03:39.090> can<00:03:39.239> make<00:03:39.360> his

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
the way back because Todd can make his

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.020 
the way back because Todd can make his
rats<00:03:39.720> much<00:03:39.959> larger<00:03:40.260> than<00:03:40.290> 22<00:03:40.769> so<00:03:41.459> a<00:03:41.489> pretty<00:03:41.790> two

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
rats much larger than 22 so a pretty two

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.880 
rats much larger than 22 so a pretty two
points<00:03:42.269> damage<00:03:42.600> there<00:03:42.780> for<00:03:42.930> max<00:03:43.110> yeah<00:03:43.680> Todd

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
points damage there for max yeah Todd

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.530 
points damage there for max yeah Todd
can<00:03:44.100> swing<00:03:44.340> for<00:03:44.489> a<00:03:44.640> tier<00:03:44.910> that's<00:03:45.150> not<00:03:45.330> gonna<00:03:45.450> be

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
can swing for a tier that's not gonna be

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.310 
can swing for a tier that's not gonna be
enough<00:03:45.660> how<00:03:46.290> I<00:03:46.320> though<00:03:46.890> and<00:03:47.220> Max<00:03:48.180> will<00:03:49.140> have<00:03:49.200> a

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
enough how I though and Max will have a

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.259 
enough how I though and Max will have a
lethal<00:03:49.769> a<00:03:50.130> near<00:03:50.430> will<00:03:50.640> not<00:03:50.760> illegal<00:03:51.090> swing

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
lethal a near will not illegal swing

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:52.490 
lethal a near will not illegal swing
back<00:03:51.420> but<00:03:51.540> I'll<00:03:51.600> gain<00:03:51.690> a<00:03:51.750> lot<00:03:51.930> of<00:03:52.050> life<00:03:52.230> on<00:03:52.410> the

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
back but I'll gain a lot of life on the

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.380 
back but I'll gain a lot of life on the
next<00:03:52.709> turn<00:03:52.830> if<00:03:53.010> Todd<00:03:53.130> goes<00:03:53.370> that<00:03:53.580> way<00:03:53.700> yeah<00:03:53.940> he

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
next turn if Todd goes that way yeah he

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.850 
next turn if Todd goes that way yeah he
drew<00:03:54.570> on<00:03:54.600> drug<00:03:54.930> connections<00:03:55.290> for<00:03:55.440> the<00:03:55.500> turn<00:03:55.680> it

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
drew on drug connections for the turn it

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.470 
drew on drug connections for the turn it
seems<00:03:56.130> like<00:03:56.280> it's<00:03:56.430> too<00:03:56.610> late<00:03:56.820> to<00:03:57.060> go<00:03:57.180> on<00:03:57.300> that

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
seems like it's too late to go on that

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.880 
seems like it's too late to go on that
plan<00:03:57.720> I<00:03:57.900> don't<00:03:58.080> think<00:03:58.110> it's<00:03:58.440> better<00:03:58.620> turn

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
plan I don't think it's better turn

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.100 
plan I don't think it's better turn
doing<00:03:59.250> that<00:04:01.670> like<00:04:02.670> Brad<00:04:02.910> taught<00:04:03.510> us<00:04:03.660> just<00:04:03.930> make

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
doing that like Brad taught us just make

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.960 
doing that like Brad taught us just make
rats<00:04:04.350> yeah<00:04:04.860> you<00:04:04.920> drew<00:04:05.910> another<00:04:06.060> pack<00:04:06.360> rat

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.180 

and<00:04:09.970> uh<00:04:10.050> you<00:04:11.050> know<00:04:11.170> I<00:04:11.200> think<00:04:11.470> that<00:04:11.770> if<00:04:11.860> I<00:04:11.950> was<00:04:12.100> in

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
and uh you know I think that if I was in

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.470 
and uh you know I think that if I was in
Todd's<00:04:12.400> position<00:04:12.850> I<00:04:12.940> would<00:04:13.000> have<00:04:13.150> taken<00:04:13.240> away

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
Todd's position I would have taken away

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.360 
Todd's position I would have taken away
the<00:04:13.569> whip<00:04:13.870> I<00:04:14.110> know<00:04:14.470> the<00:04:14.650> great<00:04:14.830> virtue<00:04:15.010> in<00:04:15.130> hand

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
the whip I know the great virtue in hand

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.880 
the whip I know the great virtue in hand
is<00:04:15.490> really<00:04:15.730> bad<00:04:15.880> for<00:04:16.209> for<00:04:16.630> Todd<00:04:16.810> but<00:04:17.109> you<00:04:17.799> know

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
is really bad for for Todd but you know

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.280 
is really bad for for Todd but you know
the<00:04:18.280> have<00:04:18.880> that<00:04:19.090> women<00:04:19.359> play<00:04:19.540> is<00:04:19.600> causing<00:04:20.109> Todd

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
the have that women play is causing Todd

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.410 
the have that women play is causing Todd
all<00:04:20.560> sorts<00:04:21.040> of<00:04:21.070> problems<00:04:21.280> right<00:04:21.549> now<00:04:21.820> and<00:04:22.060> the

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420 
all sorts of problems right now and the

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.610 
all sorts of problems right now and the
grain<00:04:22.600> merchant<00:04:22.930> is<00:04:23.020> still<00:04:23.170> president<00:04:23.440> of

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
grain merchant is still president of

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.220 
grain merchant is still president of
course<00:04:23.800> because<00:04:24.130> the<00:04:24.880> thought<00:04:25.720> she<00:04:25.900> puts<00:04:26.110> in

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
course because the thought she puts in

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.710 
course because the thought she puts in
the<00:04:26.320> graveyard<00:04:26.530> the<00:04:26.800> whip<00:04:26.980> forces<00:04:27.580> Todd<00:04:27.850> to

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
the graveyard the whip forces Todd to

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.930 
the graveyard the whip forces Todd to
sac<00:04:29.320> to<00:04:29.530> the<00:04:29.650> demon<00:04:29.950> every<00:04:30.190> turn<00:04:30.370> which<00:04:30.700> means

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
sac to the demon every turn which means

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.700 
sac to the demon every turn which means
Todd<00:04:31.120> doesn't<00:04:31.450> get<00:04:31.690> to<00:04:31.810> draw<00:04:32.020> any<00:04:32.050> more<00:04:32.230> cards

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
Todd doesn't get to draw any more cards

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.159 
Todd doesn't get to draw any more cards
yeah<00:04:33.130> so<00:04:34.060> it<00:04:34.210> seems<00:04:34.390> like<00:04:34.510> he's<00:04:34.690> stuck<00:04:34.990> on<00:04:35.140> a

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
yeah so it seems like he's stuck on a

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:36.750 
yeah so it seems like he's stuck on a
losing<00:04:35.440> board<00:04:35.770> that<00:04:35.919> he<00:04:36.040> can't<00:04:36.310> drought<00:04:36.700> of

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
losing board that he can't drought of

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.540 
losing board that he can't drought of
because<00:04:37.090> he<00:04:37.180> doesn't<00:04:37.480> get<00:04:37.600> draw<00:04:37.840> steps<00:04:38.460> Max<00:04:39.460> is

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
because he doesn't get draw steps Max is

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.430 
because he doesn't get draw steps Max is
gonna<00:04:39.669> do<00:04:39.940> exactly<00:04:40.210> as<00:04:40.390> you<00:04:40.900> meant<00:04:41.080> as<00:04:41.290> you
