00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.040 

okay<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:18.700> if<00:02:18.760> I<00:02:18.849> were<00:02:19.000> baking<00:02:19.180> or<00:02:19.540> anything<00:02:19.930> i

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
okay and if I were baking or anything i

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.979 
okay and if I were baking or anything i
would<00:02:20.200> definitely<00:02:20.440> use<00:02:20.620> an<00:02:21.010> actual<00:02:21.220> liquid

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
would definitely use an actual liquid

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.570 
would definitely use an actual liquid
measuring<00:02:22.989> cup<00:02:23.110> but<00:02:23.620> since<00:02:23.830> this<00:02:23.920> is<00:02:24.069> a<00:02:24.099> rustic

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
measuring cup but since this is a rustic

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:32.190 
measuring cup but since this is a rustic
dish<00:02:25.319> it's<00:02:26.319> not<00:02:26.470> quite<00:02:26.830> as<00:02:26.950> precise<00:02:31.050> stir<00:02:32.050> it

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
dish it's not quite as precise stir it

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:47.180 
dish it's not quite as precise stir it
up<00:02:39.420> I'll<00:02:40.420> turn<00:02:40.750> it<00:02:41.459> up<00:02:42.459> to<00:02:45.239> low<00:02:46.239> medium<00:02:46.480> again

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
up I'll turn it up to low medium again

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.549 
up I'll turn it up to low medium again
we'll<00:02:48.190> just<00:02:48.310> let<00:02:48.519> that
