00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
exercise before I've been playing 22

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.569 
exercise before I've been playing 22
years<00:00:43.000> and<00:00:43.120> I<00:00:43.149> still<00:00:43.480> use<00:00:43.660> this<00:00:43.750> exercise<00:00:47.579> when

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:48.579 
years and I still use this exercise when

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:50.310 
years and I still use this exercise when
I'm<00:00:48.699> warming<00:00:49.000> up<00:00:49.149> again<00:00:49.720> over<00:00:50.019> and<00:00:50.079> over<00:00:50.140> again

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
I'm warming up again over and over again

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.670 
I'm warming up again over and over again
up<00:00:50.590> and<00:00:50.769> down<00:00:50.920> the<00:00:51.160> fretboard

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.020 

what<00:00:57.680> I'm<00:00:57.800> doing<00:00:57.829> is<00:00:58.160> just<00:00:58.219> alternate<00:00:58.820> picking

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
what I'm doing is just alternate picking

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:08.340 
what I'm doing is just alternate picking
down<00:01:00.220> up<00:01:01.220> down<00:01:01.840> up<00:01:04.150> okay

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:21.410 

move

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.850 

now<00:01:22.420> this<00:01:22.510> is<00:01:22.690> a<00:01:22.780> very<00:01:22.930> difficult<00:01:23.200> exercise

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
now this is a very difficult exercise

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.670 
now this is a very difficult exercise
okay<00:01:24.660> when<00:01:25.660> you're<00:01:25.780> performing<00:01:25.900> it<00:01:26.260> at<00:01:26.470> that

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
okay when you're performing it at that

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.160 
okay when you're performing it at that
speed<00:01:27.010> but<00:01:27.550> the<00:01:27.670> idea<00:01:27.940> here<00:01:28.150> is<00:01:28.210> to<00:01:28.330> keep<00:01:28.630> going

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
speed but the idea here is to keep going

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.740 
speed but the idea here is to keep going
keep<00:01:29.650> going<00:01:29.950> until<00:01:30.310> your<00:01:30.610> hand<00:01:30.910> really<00:01:31.420> gets

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
keep going until your hand really gets

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.110 
keep going until your hand really gets
worked<00:01:32.050> okay<00:01:32.470> you<00:01:33.220> could<00:01:33.400> even<00:01:33.490> pick<00:01:33.970> the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
worked okay you could even pick the

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.060 
worked okay you could even pick the
strings<00:01:34.390> harder<00:01:34.900> to<00:01:35.050> force<00:01:35.320> your<00:01:35.440> fingers<00:01:35.770> to

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
strings harder to force your fingers to

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:49.860 
strings harder to force your fingers to
Fred<00:01:36.520> it<00:01:36.640> more<00:01:48.360> hotter<00:01:49.360> you're<00:01:49.510> picking<00:01:49.780> those

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870
