00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.460 

okay<00:00:01.079> guys<00:00:01.319> um<00:00:01.740> this<00:00:03.020> is<00:00:04.020> our<00:00:04.170> code<00:00:04.350> on

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
okay guys um this is our code on

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.380 
okay guys um this is our code on
worksheet<00:00:04.890> that<00:00:05.069> we're<00:00:05.190> doing<00:00:05.310> and<00:00:05.549> I<00:00:05.759> thought

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
worksheet that we're doing and I thought

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.820 
worksheet that we're doing and I thought
I'd<00:00:06.660> make<00:00:06.990> a<00:00:07.290> little<00:00:07.379> video<00:00:08.210> to<00:00:09.210> show<00:00:09.269> you<00:00:09.510> guys

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:09.830 
I'd make a little video to show you guys

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.350 
I'd make a little video to show you guys
how<00:00:10.830> to<00:00:10.860> actually<00:00:11.250> do<00:00:11.610> this<00:00:11.790> worksheet

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
how to actually do this worksheet

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.810 
how to actually do this worksheet
because<00:00:13.259> it<00:00:13.469> can<00:00:13.650> be<00:00:13.799> confusing<00:00:13.950> at<00:00:14.400> times<00:00:14.460> but

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
because it can be confusing at times but

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.420 
because it can be confusing at times but
then<00:00:14.969> sometimes<00:00:15.179> it's<00:00:15.859> for<00:00:16.859> other<00:00:17.100> people

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
then sometimes it's for other people

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.400 
then sometimes it's for other people
it's<00:00:17.520> very<00:00:17.730> self-explanatory<00:00:21.109> what<00:00:22.109> we<00:00:22.230> want

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
it's very self-explanatory what we want

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.370 
it's very self-explanatory what we want
to<00:00:22.500> do<00:00:22.619> is<00:00:22.800> we<00:00:22.949> want<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.250> find<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.850> DNA<00:00:24.630> triplet

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
to do is we want to find the DNA triplet

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.640 
to do is we want to find the DNA triplet
from<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.550> mRNA<00:00:27.150> trip<00:00:27.449> codon<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.260> then<00:00:28.529> the

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
from the mRNA trip codon and then the

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.420 
from the mRNA trip codon and then the
tRNA<00:00:29.189> anticodon<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.269> then<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.480> amino<00:00:30.900> acid

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
tRNA anticodon and then the amino acid

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.790 
tRNA anticodon and then the amino acid
and<00:00:32.430> like<00:00:32.610> we<00:00:32.790> were<00:00:32.850> doing<00:00:33.300> in<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:34.110> previous

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
and like we were doing in the previous

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.380 
and like we were doing in the previous
video<00:00:35.160> for<00:00:35.540> protein<00:00:36.540> synthesis<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:38.059> or<00:00:39.059> not

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
video for protein synthesis and or not

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:47.299 
video for protein synthesis and or not
yeah<00:00:39.809> DNA<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:40.860> protein<00:00:41.219> synthesis<00:00:46.309> we're

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
yeah DNA and protein synthesis we're

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.600 
yeah DNA and protein synthesis we're
going<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.550> do<00:00:48.860> pretty<00:00:49.860> much<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.100> same<00:00:50.370> thing

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
going to do pretty much the same thing

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.959 
going to do pretty much the same thing
here<00:00:50.910> when<00:00:51.570> we're<00:00:51.690> gonna<00:00:51.840> find<00:00:52.140> our

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:59.450 

complementary<00:00:57.079> codons<00:00:58.079> our<00:00:58.500> complementary

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
complementary codons our complementary

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.679 
complementary codons our complementary
base<00:00:59.730> pairs<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:02.570> in<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:04.500> video<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.979> tells<00:01:05.220> you

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
base pairs and in the video it tells you

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:24.140 
base pairs and in the video it tells you
in<00:01:06.920> DNA<00:01:16.070> adenine<00:01:17.070> binds<00:01:17.369> with<00:01:20.659> thymine<00:01:23.150> and

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
in DNA adenine binds with thymine and

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:42.889 
in DNA adenine binds with thymine and
cytosine<00:01:24.570> bonds<00:01:25.290> with<00:01:30.380> warning<00:01:32.990> in<00:01:33.990> RNA<00:01:41.899> we

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
cytosine bonds with warning in RNA we

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:50.770 
cytosine bonds with warning in RNA we
have<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.290> mean<00:01:43.430> bonding<00:01:45.140> with<00:01:47.930> what<00:01:48.930> was<00:01:49.110> that

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
have I mean bonding with what was that

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.139 
have I mean bonding with what was that
not<00:01:51.780> thymine<00:01:52.320> your<00:01:52.979> SLE<00:01:53.399> now<00:01:53.579> because<00:01:53.939> we<00:01:54.060> have

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
not thymine your SLE now because we have

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.020 
not thymine your SLE now because we have
uracil<00:01:54.630> in<00:01:54.750> RNA<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.439> not<00:01:55.560> thymine<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.430> we

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
uracil in RNA and not thymine and we

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.450 
uracil in RNA and not thymine and we
have<00:01:57.210> cytosine<00:01:58.729> and<00:01:59.729> guanine<00:02:01.070> still<00:02:02.070> bonding

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
have cytosine and guanine still bonding

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:12.060 
have cytosine and guanine still bonding
together<00:02:03.409> okay<00:02:04.409> so

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:19.600 

so<00:02:13.070> we<00:02:13.190> look<00:02:13.430> and<00:02:13.610> we<00:02:13.640> see<00:02:15.430> mRNA<00:02:18.430> we've<00:02:19.430> been

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
so we look and we see mRNA we've been

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.330 
so we look and we see mRNA we've been
given<00:02:19.850> a<00:02:19.910> code<00:02:20.090> on<00:02:20.240> a<00:02:20.500> AG<00:02:21.500> okay

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
given a code on a AG okay

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.890 
given a code on a AG okay
our<00:02:22.840> triplet<00:02:23.840> her<00:02:24.170> DNA<00:02:24.590> triplet<00:02:25.250> is<00:02:25.810> going<00:02:26.810> to

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
our triplet her DNA triplet is going to

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.860 
our triplet her DNA triplet is going to
be<00:02:26.990> based<00:02:27.260> off<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:28.190> mRNA<00:02:28.790> so<00:02:28.850> what<00:02:29.330> binds<00:02:29.600> with

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
be based off the mRNA so what binds with

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:36.010 
be based off the mRNA so what binds with
a<00:02:31.000> T<00:02:32.860> thought<00:02:33.860> I<00:02:33.920> mean<00:02:34.450> what<00:02:35.450> binds<00:02:35.660> with<00:02:35.990> a

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
a T thought I mean what binds with a

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:44.470 
a T thought I mean what binds with a
here<00:02:36.740> T<00:02:37.460> and<00:02:38.230> what<00:02:39.230> binds<00:02:39.440> with<00:02:39.620> G<00:02:40.300> see<00:02:43.150> now<00:02:44.150> it

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
here T and what binds with G see now it

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.060 
here T and what binds with G see now it
wants<00:02:44.750> us<00:02:44.840> to<00:02:44.900> find<00:02:45.520> the<00:02:47.080> tRNA<00:02:48.110> the<00:02:48.440> anticodon

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
wants us to find the tRNA the anticodon

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.330 
wants us to find the tRNA the anticodon
that's<00:02:49.400> going<00:02:49.670> to<00:02:49.760> bind<00:02:49.910> to<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:50.240> mRNA<00:02:50.780> that's

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
that's going to bind to the mRNA that's

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:59.650 
that's going to bind to the mRNA that's
going<00:02:52.340> to<00:02:52.430> be<00:02:52.610> a<00:02:55.000> bonds<00:02:56.000> with<00:02:56.350> T<00:02:57.350> nope<00:02:58.450> not<00:02:59.450> in

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
going to be a bonds with T nope not in

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.920 
going to be a bonds with T nope not in
RNA<00:03:01.930> because<00:03:02.930> in<00:03:03.230> RNA<00:03:03.710> a<00:03:03.980> bonds<00:03:04.880> with<00:03:05.060> you<00:03:05.510> so

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
RNA because in RNA a bonds with you so

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:12.670 
RNA because in RNA a bonds with you so
now<00:03:06.080> you're<00:03:06.200> gonna<00:03:06.320> have<00:03:06.590> use<00:03:07.390> U<00:03:10.390> and<00:03:11.650> then<00:03:12.650> we

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
now you're gonna have use U and then we

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.050 
now you're gonna have use U and then we
have<00:03:13.010> another<00:03:13.100> eye<00:03:13.310> over<00:03:13.550> here<00:03:13.610> so<00:03:13.850> it's<00:03:13.940> gonna

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
have another eye over here so it's gonna

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.590 
have another eye over here so it's gonna
bond<00:03:14.240> with<00:03:14.390> you<00:03:14.660> and<00:03:17.470> G<00:03:18.610> so<00:03:19.610> we're<00:03:19.760> gonna<00:03:19.850> see

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
bond with you and G so we're gonna see

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.170 
bond with you and G so we're gonna see
here<00:03:20.960> because<00:03:21.650> G<00:03:22.160> and<00:03:22.340> C<00:03:22.490> bond<00:03:22.700> together<00:03:22.850> their

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
here because G and C bond together their

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.820 
here because G and C bond together their
complementary<00:03:23.870> base<00:03:24.080> pairs<00:03:24.380> to<00:03:24.470> each<00:03:24.620> other

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
complementary base pairs to each other

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.800 
complementary base pairs to each other
now<00:03:25.760> it<00:03:26.000> wants<00:03:26.210> you<00:03:26.570> to<00:03:27.260> find<00:03:27.500> the<00:03:27.680> amino<00:03:28.070> acid

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
now it wants you to find the amino acid

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.720 
now it wants you to find the amino acid
well<00:03:31.180> like<00:03:32.180> I<00:03:32.360> said<00:03:32.420> this<00:03:33.380> is<00:03:33.560> a<00:03:33.710> codon<00:03:34.700> chart

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
well like I said this is a codon chart

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.470 
well like I said this is a codon chart
so<00:03:35.210> we're<00:03:35.300> gonna<00:03:35.390> use<00:03:35.480> codons<00:03:36.490> to<00:03:37.490> look<00:03:37.760> up<00:03:37.970> the

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
so we're gonna use codons to look up the

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.390 
so we're gonna use codons to look up the
amino<00:03:38.959> acids

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.570 

where's<00:03:43.400> are<00:03:44.090> the<00:03:44.360> codons<00:03:44.720> located<00:03:45.380> on<00:03:45.590> the

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
where's are the codons located on the

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.160 
where's are the codons located on the
mRNA<00:03:47.300> okay<00:03:48.160> now<00:03:49.160> this<00:03:49.280> is<00:03:49.340> very<00:03:50.140> common<00:03:51.140> for

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
mRNA okay now this is very common for

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.590 
mRNA okay now this is very common for
people<00:03:51.350> to<00:03:51.680> get<00:03:51.800> confused<00:03:54.850> we<00:03:55.850> do<00:03:56.000> not<00:03:56.150> use<00:03:56.450> the

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
people to get confused we do not use the

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.900 
people to get confused we do not use the
tRNA<00:03:57.200> we<00:03:58.070> use<00:03:58.250> the<00:03:58.459> mRNA<00:04:00.130> so<00:04:01.130> going<00:04:01.550> back<00:04:01.730> over

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
tRNA we use the mRNA so going back over

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.190 
tRNA we use the mRNA so going back over
here<00:04:02.390> a<00:04:02.600> a<00:04:02.990> G<00:04:03.830> so<00:04:04.220> we're<00:04:04.340> looking<00:04:04.610> up<00:04:04.700> a<00:04:04.910> a<00:04:04.940> G<00:04:05.420> we

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
here a a G so we're looking up a a G we

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.230 
here a a G so we're looking up a a G we
want<00:04:06.500> to<00:04:06.680> start<00:04:07.070> in<00:04:07.280> the<00:04:07.459> very<00:04:07.700> middle<00:04:08.060> the

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.240 
want to start in the very middle the

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.150 
want to start in the very middle the
very<00:04:08.450> center<00:04:08.930> and<00:04:09.140> then<00:04:09.530> work<00:04:09.770> our<00:04:10.010> way<00:04:10.040> out

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
very center and then work our way out

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.010 
very center and then work our way out
okay<00:04:11.020> so<00:04:12.020> it<00:04:13.010> was<00:04:13.190> a<00:04:13.370> AG<00:04:13.970> so<00:04:14.209> we<00:04:14.300> have<00:04:14.420> a<00:04:14.600> here

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.020 
okay so it was a AG so we have a here

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:22.540 
okay so it was a AG so we have a here
and<00:04:15.200> this<00:04:15.729> so<00:04:16.729> we<00:04:16.850> know<00:04:17.030> it's<00:04:17.239> within<00:04:17.479> this

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.260 

forth<00:04:24.470> then<00:04:25.470> we<00:04:25.710> look<00:04:25.980> and<00:04:26.250> we<00:04:26.280> say<00:04:26.640> okay<00:04:27.240> a

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
forth then we look and we say okay a

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.440 
forth then we look and we say okay a
again<00:04:28.640> so<00:04:29.640> we're<00:04:29.730> gonna<00:04:29.820> look<00:04:29.970> within<00:04:30.300> this

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
again so we're gonna look within this

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:40.310 
again so we're gonna look within this
circle<00:04:30.750> a<00:04:31.250> and<00:04:32.250> then<00:04:38.630> we're<00:04:39.630> gonna<00:04:39.750> look<00:04:40.020> at<00:04:40.260> it

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
circle a and then we're gonna look at it

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.900 
circle a and then we're gonna look at it
says<00:04:40.500> G<00:04:40.890> so<00:04:41.400> we<00:04:41.490> find<00:04:41.730> G<00:04:42.000> right<00:04:42.240> here<00:04:42.450> and<00:04:42.690> it's

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
says G so we find G right here and it's

00:04:43.910 --> 00:05:05.780 
says G so we find G right here and it's
lysine<00:05:01.400> okay<00:05:03.140> and<00:05:04.140> I'm<00:05:04.230> sorry<00:05:04.260> this<00:05:04.890> is<00:05:05.130> so

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
lysine okay and I'm sorry this is so

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.860 
lysine okay and I'm sorry this is so
sloppy<00:05:06.030> but<00:05:06.390> I<00:05:07.250> don't<00:05:08.250> have<00:05:08.430> much<00:05:08.790> I<00:05:09.180> don't

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
sloppy but I don't have much I don't

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.180 
sloppy but I don't have much I don't
have<00:05:10.020> any<00:05:10.170> other<00:05:10.350> software<00:05:10.710> to<00:05:11.130> do<00:05:11.250> this<00:05:11.460> on<00:05:11.960> um

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
have any other software to do this on um

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.080 
have any other software to do this on um
GGC<00:05:14.190> okay<00:05:15.150> that's<00:05:15.390> our<00:05:15.680> DNA<00:05:16.680> triplet<00:05:17.520> so<00:05:17.970> we

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
GGC okay that's our DNA triplet so we

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.270 
GGC okay that's our DNA triplet so we
want<00:05:18.270> to<00:05:18.360> find<00:05:18.510> our<00:05:18.630> mRNA<00:05:19.290> that<00:05:19.590> goes<00:05:20.070> with

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
want to find our mRNA that goes with

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:28.300 
want to find our mRNA that goes with
this<00:05:20.460> and<00:05:21.000> we<00:05:21.540> know<00:05:21.690> that<00:05:21.930> G<00:05:22.860> bonds<00:05:23.100> IC<00:05:25.340> j<00:05:26.340> Ponzo

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
this and we know that G bonds IC j Ponzo

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:33.260 
this and we know that G bonds IC j Ponzo
c-c<00:05:29.310> bonds<00:05:29.580> with<00:05:29.850> G<00:05:31.730> we<00:05:32.730> want<00:05:32.910> to<00:05:33.000> find<00:05:33.120> our

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
c-c bonds with G we want to find our

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:38.210 
c-c bonds with G we want to find our
tRNA<00:05:33.890> now<00:05:34.890> it's<00:05:35.010> just<00:05:35.100> gonna<00:05:35.310> be<00:05:36.410> C<00:05:37.410> bonding

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
tRNA now it's just gonna be C bonding

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:47.140 
tRNA now it's just gonna be C bonding
with<00:05:38.400> a<00:05:38.580> G<00:05:40.370> C<00:05:41.370> bonding<00:05:41.970> with<00:05:42.120> G<00:05:44.090> G<00:05:45.090> Abunimah<00:05:45.390> see

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
with a G C bonding with G G Abunimah see

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.870 
with a G C bonding with G G Abunimah see
we<00:05:48.150> look<00:05:48.360> up<00:05:48.540> our<00:05:48.720> amino<00:05:49.050> acid<00:05:49.560> we<00:05:50.460> use<00:05:50.669> our

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
we look up our amino acid we use our

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.250 
we look up our amino acid we use our
codon<00:05:51.570> which<00:05:52.100> is<00:05:53.100> found<00:05:53.370> on<00:05:53.610> the<00:05:53.760> mRNA<00:05:54.450> so<00:05:55.110> we

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:55.260 
codon which is found on the mRNA so we

00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:00.890 
codon which is found on the mRNA so we
look<00:05:55.530> for<00:05:55.770> C<00:05:56.010> c/g<00:05:59.210> so<00:06:00.210> again<00:06:00.450> we're<00:06:00.600> gonna<00:06:00.660> go

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
look for C c/g so again we're gonna go

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.310 
look for C c/g so again we're gonna go
to<00:06:00.990> the<00:06:01.200> inner<00:06:01.350> circle<00:06:01.710> here<00:06:03.140> let<00:06:04.140> me<00:06:04.169> just

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 
to the inner circle here let me just

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:19.310 
to the inner circle here let me just
erase<00:06:04.710> this<00:06:05.190> so<00:06:05.430> nobody<00:06:05.790> gets<00:06:05.880> confused<00:06:18.320> most

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.320 
erase this so nobody gets confused most

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:26.300 
erase this so nobody gets confused most
remove<00:06:19.650> on<00:06:22.729> so<00:06:23.729> again<00:06:24.030> it<00:06:24.330> was<00:06:24.510> C<00:06:25.320> c/g<00:06:25.590> so<00:06:26.130> we

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.310 
remove on so again it was C c/g so we

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:30.370 
remove on so again it was C c/g so we
are<00:06:26.580> in<00:06:26.880> this<00:06:27.410> fourth<00:06:28.410> of<00:06:28.770> the<00:06:29.760> codon<00:06:30.090> chart

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:30.380 
are in this fourth of the codon chart

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.719 
are in this fourth of the codon chart
because<00:06:31.380> there<00:06:31.590> see<00:06:31.890> in<00:06:32.160> the<00:06:32.280> middle<00:06:32.550> and<00:06:32.640> then

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:32.729 
because there see in the middle and then

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:33.709 
because there see in the middle and then
we<00:06:32.820> work<00:06:32.970> our<00:06:33.150> way

00:06:33.709 --> 00:06:33.719 
we work our way

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:36.260 
we work our way
so<00:06:34.199> we<00:06:34.319> find<00:06:34.559> our<00:06:34.710> other<00:06:34.740> C<00:06:35.309> and<00:06:35.729> it<00:06:35.879> in<00:06:36.029> the

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.270 
so we find our other C and it in the

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.959 
so we find our other C and it in the
second<00:06:36.659> row<00:06:36.840> and<00:06:37.139> there<00:06:37.259> it<00:06:37.379> is<00:06:37.529> C<00:06:37.889> and<00:06:38.610> we<00:06:38.699> find

00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:38.969 
second row and there it is C and we find

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:41.600 
second row and there it is C and we find
our<00:06:39.300> third<00:06:39.749> letter<00:06:40.080> in<00:06:40.680> the<00:06:40.830> third<00:06:41.069> row<00:06:41.309> and

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:41.610 
our third letter in the third row and

00:06:41.610 --> 00:07:03.350 
our third letter in the third row and
it's<00:06:41.759> G<00:06:42.089> so<00:06:42.449> it's<00:06:43.909> proline<00:06:58.580> okay<00:06:59.580> I<00:07:02.120> think<00:07:03.120> I

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 
it's G so it's proline okay I think I

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.369 
it's G so it's proline okay I think I
was<00:07:03.479> the<00:07:03.629> same<00:07:05.150> you<00:07:06.150> know<00:07:06.180> on<00:07:06.599> down<00:07:06.629> through

00:07:07.369 --> 00:07:07.379 
was the same you know on down through

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:14.029 
was the same you know on down through
here<00:07:08.029> now<00:07:09.029> there<00:07:09.210> are<00:07:09.300> other<00:07:09.449> questions<00:07:13.039> that

00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:14.039 
here now there are other questions that

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:19.100 
here now there are other questions that
are<00:07:16.279> on<00:07:17.279> the<00:07:17.430> second<00:07:17.819> page<00:07:18.029> but<00:07:18.749> I<00:07:18.810> feel<00:07:19.020> like

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:19.110 
are on the second page but I feel like

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:24.260 
are on the second page but I feel like
those<00:07:19.319> were<00:07:19.879> if<00:07:20.879> you<00:07:21.150> can<00:07:22.339> answer<00:07:23.339> these

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:24.270 
those were if you can answer these

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:27.230 
those were if you can answer these
questions<00:07:25.249> then<00:07:26.249> you<00:07:26.279> can<00:07:26.550> answer<00:07:26.759> the<00:07:27.060> other

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240 
questions then you can answer the other

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.389 
questions then you can answer the other
ones<00:07:27.569> but<00:07:28.319> if<00:07:28.439> you<00:07:28.589> have<00:07:28.800> trouble<00:07:29.370> with

00:07:29.389 --> 00:07:29.399 
ones but if you have trouble with

00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:34.969 
ones but if you have trouble with
anything<00:07:29.899> you<00:07:30.899> can<00:07:31.169> always<00:07:31.469> email<00:07:31.949> me<00:07:33.199> and<00:07:34.199> I
