00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
this but I'm just going to go over it

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.240 
this but I'm just going to go over it
real<00:01:47.820> quick<00:01:48.290> so<00:01:49.290> this<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:50.180> 64<00:01:51.180> gig<00:01:51.680> and<00:01:52.680> it's

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
real quick so this is a 64 gig and it's

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.280 
real quick so this is a 64 gig and it's
a<00:01:53.399> class<00:01:53.610> 10<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.240> it's<00:01:54.360> actually<00:01:54.689> super<00:01:55.049> fast

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290

sitting<00:02:27.000> there<00:02:27.120> waiting<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:27.660> waiting<00:02:27.840> and

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
sitting there waiting and waiting and

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.780 
sitting there waiting and waiting and
waiting<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.530> I<00:02:28.710> was<00:02:28.830> like<00:02:28.950> this<00:02:29.160> thing<00:02:29.430> just

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
waiting and I was like this thing just

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.350 
waiting and I was like this thing just
isn't<00:02:30.120> going<00:02:30.600> to<00:02:30.780> see<00:02:30.960> it<00:02:31.460> so<00:02:32.460> you<00:02:32.940> may<00:02:33.090> run

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
isn't going to see it so you may run

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.190 
isn't going to see it so you may run
into<00:02:33.420> that<00:02:34.490> when<00:02:35.490> you<00:02:35.610> mount<00:02:36.270> it<00:02:36.480> so<00:02:36.720> for

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
into that when you mount it so for

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.750 
into that when you mount it so for
example<00:02:37.320> as<00:02:37.710> you<00:02:37.800> can<00:02:37.920> see<00:02:38.070> I've<00:02:38.280> put<00:02:38.520> it<00:02:38.640> in

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
example as you can see I've put it in

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.910 
example as you can see I've put it in
and<00:02:39.000> of<00:02:39.240> course<00:02:39.540> I'm<00:02:39.780> not<00:02:40.020> seeing<00:02:40.410> anything

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
and of course I'm not seeing anything

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.000 
and of course I'm not seeing anything
happen<00:02:41.490> here<00:02:41.640> right<00:02:41.850> now<00:02:42.060> so<00:02:42.330> i<00:02:43.320> will<00:02:43.350> have<00:02:43.680> to

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
happen here right now so i will have to

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.300 
happen here right now so i will have to
reboot<00:02:44.460> before<00:02:44.910> i<00:02:44.940> actually<00:02:45.240> see<00:02:45.870> it<00:02:46.070> so<00:02:47.070> i'll

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
reboot before i actually see it so i'll

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.940 
reboot before i actually see it so i'll
go<00:02:47.430> ahead<00:02:47.460> and<00:02:47.610> do<00:02:47.760> that<00:02:47.790> now
