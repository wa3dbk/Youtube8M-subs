00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
well-balanced game if it wasn't for

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.160 
well-balanced game if it wasn't for
those<00:01:36.090> deaf<00:01:36.390> streaks<00:01:36.720> completely

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.749 
those deaf streaks completely
unnecessary<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:37.979> tend<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.220> take<00:01:38.430> out<00:01:38.640> that

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.730 
unnecessary and I tend to take out that
kind<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:39.119> thing<00:01:39.270> now<00:01:40.049> in<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.320> cup<00:01:40.500> games

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
that kind of stuff but it was definitely

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.580 
that kind of stuff but it was definitely
something<00:04:01.000> really<00:04:01.720> cool<00:04:01.900> in<00:04:02.050> my<00:04:02.080> opinion

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
modern warfare 2 is a cool game for me

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.899 
modern warfare 2 is a cool game for me
but<00:04:44.289> when<00:04:44.710> I<00:04:44.740> first<00:04:44.979> play<00:04:45.189> modern<00:04:45.490> fair<00:04:45.669> 3<00:04:45.879> I

00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:45.909 
but when I first play modern fair 3 I

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:48.119 
but when I first play modern fair 3 I
thought<00:04:46.120> what<00:04:46.360> is<00:04:46.479> this<00:04:46.599> modern<00:04:46.930> warfare<00:04:47.129> 2.5

00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:48.129 
thought what is this modern warfare 2.5

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:50.339 
thought what is this modern warfare 2.5
it<00:04:48.370> used<00:04:48.610> some<00:04:48.759> very<00:04:48.789> similar<00:04:49.210> textures<00:04:49.900> like

00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:50.349 
it used some very similar textures like

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:52.290 
it used some very similar textures like
even<00:04:50.680> the<00:04:50.800> fonts<00:04:51.219> and<00:04:51.400> the<00:04:51.430> scoreboards<00:04:52.180> and

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
even the fonts and the scoreboards and

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.779 
even the fonts and the scoreboards and
that<00:04:52.419> looked<00:04:52.629> much<00:04:53.229> identical<00:04:53.889> a<00:04:54.099> little

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:54.789 
that looked much identical a little

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:56.490 
that looked much identical a little
disappointed<00:04:55.360> they<00:04:55.750> didn't<00:04:56.050> really<00:04:56.199> kind<00:04:56.379> of

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
disappointed they didn't really kind of

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.129 
disappointed they didn't really kind of
undergo<00:04:56.949> more<00:04:57.189> of<00:04:57.400> a<00:04:57.840> massive<00:04:58.840> undertaking

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.629 
so overall modern warfare 3 at the time
I<00:05:33.879> feel<00:05:34.330> like<00:05:34.509> it<00:05:34.750> was<00:05:34.900> ok<00:05:35.589> but<00:05:35.650> a<00:05:36.009> bit<00:05:36.279> samey

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639

from<00:05:37.150> modern<00:05:37.419> warfare<00:05:37.599> 2<00:05:37.810> but<00:05:38.560> looking<00:05:38.889> back<00:05:39.039> I

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
from modern warfare 2 but looking back I

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.800 
from modern warfare 2 but looking back I
feel<00:05:39.400> like<00:05:39.460> it<00:05:39.729> was<00:05:39.909> a<00:05:39.940> pretty<00:05:40.210> good<00:05:40.419> game<00:05:40.629> it

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
feel like it was a pretty good game it

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.629 
feel like it was a pretty good game it
was<00:05:40.930> fun<00:05:41.199> to<00:05:41.409> play<00:05:41.620> I<00:05:41.650> have<00:05:41.949> a<00:05:41.979> lot<00:05:42.159> more<00:05:42.190> fun<00:05:42.490> in

was fun to play I have a lot more fun in

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:45.360 
was fun to play I have a lot more fun in
that<00:05:42.759> game<00:05:42.969> by<00:05:43.389> doing<00:05:43.659> ghosts<00:05:44.289> I'd<00:05:44.860> say<00:05:45.129> I<00:05:45.159> had

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
that game by doing ghosts I'd say I had

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:46.589 
that game by doing ghosts I'd say I had
about<00:05:45.550> the<00:05:45.669> same<00:05:45.879> amount<00:05:46.000> of<00:05:46.180> fun<00:05:46.360> playing

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:46.599 
about the same amount of fun playing

about the same amount of fun playing
black<00:05:46.839> ops<00:05:46.960> 2<00:05:47.229> I<00:05:47.259> felt<00:05:47.500> like<00:05:47.589> black<00:05:47.740> ops<00:05:47.919> 2<00:05:48.069> is<00:05:48.190> a

00:05:48.209 --> 00:05:48.219 
black ops 2 I felt like black ops 2 is a

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:51.180 
black ops 2 I felt like black ops 2 is a
little<00:05:48.460> bit<00:05:48.639> more<00:05:48.870> polished<00:05:49.870> and<00:05:50.169> balanced<00:05:51.099> in

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.190 
little bit more polished and balanced in

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:52.740 
little bit more polished and balanced in
my<00:05:51.310> opinion<00:05:51.610> more<00:05:51.759> of<00:05:51.879> a<00:05:51.969> 3<00:05:52.210> but<00:05:52.569> more

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
my opinion more of a 3 but more

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.510 
my opinion more of a 3 but more
faithfully<00:05:53.169> still<00:05:53.500> definitely<00:05:53.949> had<00:05:54.069> that<00:05:54.250> fun

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
faithfully still definitely had that fun

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:00.099 
the assault streaks are a little bit

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:02.339 
the assault streaks are a little bit
weak<00:06:00.339> in<00:06:00.550> ghosts<00:06:00.819> but<00:06:01.120> in<00:06:01.360> a<00:06:01.750> core<00:06:02.020> dream<00:06:02.229> on

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:02.349 
weak in ghosts but in a core dream on

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:04.019 
weak in ghosts but in a core dream on

00:06:04.019 --> 00:06:04.029 
warfare 3 there was still really fun and

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:06.059 
warfare 3 there was still really fun and
also<00:06:04.300> the<00:06:04.449> first<00:06:04.659> time<00:06:04.870> you<00:06:05.289> could<00:06:05.469> select<00:06:05.710> a

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:06.069 
also the first time you could select a

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:07.890 
also the first time you could select a
custom<00:06:06.550> kill<00:06:06.789> streak<00:06:07.029> for<00:06:07.180> every<00:06:07.539> create<00:06:07.870> a

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:07.900 
custom kill streak for every create a

class<00:06:08.259> that<00:06:08.560> was<00:06:08.949> a<00:06:08.979> big<00:06:09.189> thing<00:06:09.400> at<00:06:09.490> a<00:06:09.580> time<00:06:09.759> it

00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:09.909 
class that was a big thing at a time it

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:11.610 
class that was a big thing at a time it
sounded<00:06:10.270> complicated<00:06:10.930> but<00:06:11.259> when<00:06:11.379> it<00:06:11.469> came

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.620 
sounded complicated but when it came

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.379 
sounded complicated but when it came
down<00:06:11.680> to<00:06:11.919> it<00:06:12.189> you<00:06:12.310> really<00:06:12.460> wanted<00:06:12.759> to<00:06:12.849> get<00:06:13.029> kind

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:13.389 
down to it you really wanted to get kind

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:15.209 
down to it you really wanted to get kind
of<00:06:13.449> precise<00:06:13.839> with<00:06:14.080> every<00:06:14.349> single<00:06:14.500> class<00:06:14.800> it

00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:15.219 
of precise with every single class it

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:16.350 
of precise with every single class it
was<00:06:15.310> actually<00:06:15.580> really<00:06:15.729> useful<00:06:15.969> and

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 
was actually really useful and

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.820 
was actually really useful and
definitely<00:06:16.990> a<00:06:17.050> thing<00:06:17.229> that<00:06:17.439> I<00:06:17.469> heard<00:06:17.650> they

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:17.830 
definitely a thing that I heard they

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.559 
definitely a thing that I heard they
implement<00:06:18.219> in<00:06:18.430> every<00:06:18.879> quarters<00:06:19.180> Duty<00:06:19.389> going

00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:19.569

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:20.939 
implement in every quarters Duty going
forward<00:06:19.930> as<00:06:19.990> well<00:06:20.139> so<00:06:20.379> don't<00:06:20.589> think<00:06:20.740> that<00:06:20.830> was

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:20.949 
forward as well so don't think that was

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:23.010 
forward as well so don't think that was
in<00:06:21.039> black<00:06:21.250> ops<00:06:21.430> 2<00:06:21.610> actually<00:06:21.789> so<00:06:22.629> anyway<00:06:22.870> that's

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.020 
in black ops 2 actually so anyway that's

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.329
