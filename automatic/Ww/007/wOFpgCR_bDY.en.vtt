small<00:01:46.880> stunts<00:01:47.880> over<00:01:48.060> there<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:49.380> we've<00:01:49.770> got

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
small stunts over there and we've got

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.770 
small stunts over there and we've got
the<00:01:50.189> slime<00:01:50.610> mob<00:01:50.970> as<00:01:51.149> well

the slime mob as well

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.990

now<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.560> slime<00:01:52.950> mob<00:01:53.189> doesn't<00:01:53.549> actually<00:01:53.640> do

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
now the slime mob doesn't actually do

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.910 
now the slime mob doesn't actually do
anything<00:01:54.030> it's<00:01:54.540> just<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.780> translucent<00:01:55.560> cube

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
anything it's just a translucent cube

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.190

but<00:01:56.460> is<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.670> nice<00:01:56.909> addition<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.540> be<00:01:57.810> mindful

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
but is a nice addition to be mindful

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.490 
but is a nice addition to be mindful
figure<00:01:58.680> ranges<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.640> is<00:02:00.030> pretty<00:02:00.390> sweet

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
figure ranges so it is pretty sweet

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.590 
figure ranges so it is pretty sweet
ok<00:02:03.400> so<00:02:03.460> now<00:02:03.700> we're<00:02:03.820> going<00:02:03.850> to<00:02:04.030> go<00:02:04.180> ahead<00:02:04.420> and
