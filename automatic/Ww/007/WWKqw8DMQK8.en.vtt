00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.620
 after so much time the explanation of the song gives details 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.849
 by Roberto Carlos at the acoustic performance 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.839
 the sequence of chords that we will use to 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:13.979
 the execution of this piece of music 

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:15.709
 It will be the biggest 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:17.249
 occasionally 

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:20.309
 well this variation of this variation of the greater 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.999
 Yeah sure 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:25.460
 my seventh 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.429
 and they get married 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:32.399
 this has initially this room those are the sequels and the rhythm 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.610
 vv 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.710
 the 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.480
 ain 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
 Miguel 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.750
 puyi 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.290
 the most important thing of the execution of two people and load 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.590
 we are not chords 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.530
 since they are simple the most rigorous in execution is strong 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.010
 continuation 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.830
 they happened to see 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.670
 the execution of art 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.410
 let's start with him the greatest 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.130
 in the greater as what is not with cecilia 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.350
 what he says index finger to the middle and beni that 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.330
 on the ropes 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.770
 fourth third and second of the guitar in the second setback 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.770
 with the thumb with the thumb and the finger 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.100
 with which we have what I did 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.670
 we will put it on the fifth string corresponding to the actier's note 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:53.600
 third 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.789
 string in the same position as the acc that corresponds to that same musical note 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.530
 and doing and we will execute them at the same time we will continue with the 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.980
 as he remembers that stubbornness but the heart remembers the first agreement 

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:11.349
 it would be this way 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.239
 do not 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:14.169
 after 

00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:17.169
 we will spend to pay something else the variation of the 

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:21.429
 elderly diminished 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:26.469
 that shell forms with the middle finger 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:29.689
 they are adding fret on the fourth string the finger 

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:35.689
 index the mem first teaser the third string to finish with it finger 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:38.179
 cancel on the second fret 

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:40.539
 on the second string 

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:43.699
 and it would be the execution aspect as follows 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.259
 when entering the variation 

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:51.239
 I would be with him 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:52.639
 with the thumb 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:55.539
 on the sixth string of the index finger 

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:57.359
 on the third string 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.669
 and the next one from this one 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:01.809
 two bodies ropes 

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:03.699
 first time 

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:05.929
 and it would be this way by hitting 

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:09.369
 the first chord of peeling and its risk 

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:11.209
 one 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.109
 oo osta 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:15.989
 do not 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.389
 it's not going to stop you 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:21.789
 how can you rotate 

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:24.789
 when executing the first chord 

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:27.790
 the second 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.790
 there was a payer ar 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.829
 for 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.370
 it is already clear that it will be what it was 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.829
 what it is to talk about initial batch of 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.829
 all 

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:48.399

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:51.399
 we passed to sinaloa sanity 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.069
 and we started with his harassment under principal 

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:06.629
 this way that cozumel arpeggio in which we will search mainly for all 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.629
 the song 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.479
 we continue in the same way with the note of my seventh 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.059
 uu 

00:04:29.059 --> 00:04:30.710

 what has spoken until the attempted 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:47.159
 the number of mercy 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.639
 for a long time doing mobility
