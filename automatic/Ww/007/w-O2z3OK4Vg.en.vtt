00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:14.040
 today on the bench would that strongly 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:17.730
 people speak Turkish we really 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.420
 to be clear in the window and Ukraine 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.510
 gold made in Ukraine will fall 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:26.480
 Only here on technology Turkish this 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.779
 completely different thing what does this mean 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.960
 That means what makes the product pour out 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.649
 from the wire which is empty inside as 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.210
 Cybric is just a shell that give this 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.899
 process he 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.680
 products become wide but due to 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.420
 voids inside they weigh very little 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.500
 Respectively not so expensive 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:56.120
 criteria how to distinguish products 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.449
 hollow slabs and for starters I will say that 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.120
 seller 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.070
 if you ask show you cast 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.430
 full-bodied style and he will answer you 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.710
 the truth but to yourself. auto 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.650
 I am a little competent in these matters 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:15.080
 I will teach you at least visually 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:19.409
 understand and here it is true 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:24.240
 weighs 20 grams 20 grams for such 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:28.110
 articles in this volume is not enough that 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:33.400
 there is within each shift and empty for 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:37.180
 account of this on the new will be aisin volume 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:40.530
 little to be understood cast 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:48.330
 full products on 22 true 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:55.630
 looks like this in one weight 2 products 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:02:00.180
 only 1 cast and full-fledged author , they 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:05.979
 in their own interesting inside there is or 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:07.930
 give the department a lot they have it can 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.470
 not even the very first one is from 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:14.020
 fragility when frayed 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:22.300
 shell is something inside emptiness and link 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:27.450
 crumbles like that Bismarck in 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:34.370
 which is 14 grams cast full-bodied 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:38.900
 what do you look like with 14 thunderous items 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:45.080
 which are empty long 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:45.080
 lightweight thrown away 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:58.010
 another weave full weighted sheet 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:58.010
 14 well there for the candles 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:11.380
 a full and a full and weaving 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:11.380
 completing the treatment go and this topic 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:23.840
 for comparison, I can say that like this 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:28.670
 Looks like exaggerated Bismarck one of his 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:35.570
 6 grams himself is not a tyrant even 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:38.120
 wider than cast 6 grams look wider 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:41.590
 bulky not steps 14 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:46.900
 but it looks like this 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.900
 cast full-weight free 6 grams 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.720
 it is complete if you already understand it 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:58.970
 means that the wire is inside 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:01.610
 full walls fly and and not thin 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:11.030
 Respectively and rubbing me very 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:17.260
 should serve it will be very long well 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:17.260
 It looks like weaving 14 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:30.099
 empty inside each link it consists 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.630
 each of 4 coiled wires 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:35.620
 wires inside is empty 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:40.389
 only the shell looks like this on 14 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:43.620
 grams and tourists and so here you 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:47.259
 the difference is take the product in hand and 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.750
 understand that with such a volume and weigh 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:53.710
 20 grams 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:57.460
 it means a lot with such volume 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:00.340
 inside it would seem visually and visually 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:03.900
 do you know when to take it in hand 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.900
 be it really 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:13.480
 of these phrases pussy 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:19.100
 Here is the bracelet volume 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:22.300
 interestingly with inserts on a small 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:26.570
 the weight of the whole action 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:29.240
 inside every link is empty if she 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:31.790
 was victoria accordingly this 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:35.300
 dawn and would weigh a lot but 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:38.420
 would be very expensive and unlikely he was 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:44.090
 would be available to the average buyer 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:47.570
 and with such a weight of course you can 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:49.810
 buy and wear and rejoice and 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.810
 enjoy 

00:05:54.429 --> 00:06:02.629
 Well, about here you have to light up 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:08.869
 desire and cast full and goals and 

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:13.749
 here they know the advantages of this volume and not very 

00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:17.330
 costly you know cons 

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:22.059
 partitions fine rubbing fast 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:26.119
 I am so durable some product 

00:06:22.059 --> 00:06:29.509
 but we are not interested and available in 

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:31.699
 combined with other flowers and lemon for 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:36.099
 white red shot down 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:36.099
 or just beautiful weaving 

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:40.700
 and
