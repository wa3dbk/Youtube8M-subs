been a time of God that I haven't seen
them<00:03:19.819> on<00:03:20.000> some<00:03:20.660> occasions<00:03:21.200> you<00:03:21.260> get<00:03:21.470> really

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:21.889 
them on some occasions you get really

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:23.860 
them on some occasions you get really
close<00:03:22.130> to<00:03:22.340> them<00:03:22.489> like<00:03:22.639> sometimes<00:03:23.389> they<00:03:23.540> swoop

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870
