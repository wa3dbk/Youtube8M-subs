 us 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:14.370
 vegetables-fruits well what can I say they 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:17.160
 beautiful especially if season well if not 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.350
 the season is also good 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.800
 look because there are fruits 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:26.010
 that no one knows everything at all 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:30.119
 the season is not very well chosen within 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:36.030
 the country of the place on the planet where you 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:39.480
 live and gnawing funk available well 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.820
 the very thing is where I live apples apples 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.170
 they are all year round 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.690
 almost all year round only later 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:52.670
 spring when they already have to choose 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:55.410
 not all varieties are the dough if 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.270
 such a thing if you want to get from 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.000
 the point of maximum benefit is the best 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:05.729
 separately these want the world maximum 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.590
 better fruit have one can grease 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:14.150
 want but one kind will always be very 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:16.950
 wonderfully somewhat in the morning instead of x and 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:21.570
 almost always, and the shadows in the Visiting good 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.430
 people who made delicious i just 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.840
 should this be jim today we are so 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.549
 I feel ashamed to look into my eyes tomorrow 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.009
 those who participated 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.189
 so us ordinary life and fruit y 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.740
 try again if it suits you 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.600
 people are different at all even different need 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.630
 somehow choose because someone so 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.090
 how I ate once a week and well someone 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.969
 us 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.460
 more often like u eat but none the less 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:51.909
 scheme like fruit work in the morning 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.549
 chic fruit salads which too 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:57.069
 today make fruit instead of sweep away 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:59.770
 fermented milk too but especially for children 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:04.689
 like children room yes what there 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:06.459
 after all, few of their brides but there in the morning 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:10.479
 borsch rice 

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:12.239
 bread cantaloupe watermelon ice to have it all 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.510
 in the morning there is well everything ends sadly 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:24.280
 from your energy goes to digestion 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:26.980
 in the morning I donâ€™t have much energy 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:31.560
 fits as it fits very nicely 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:34.720
 suitable but there is a certain feature 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:39.549
 watermelon and melon cleans very well 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.950
 the body and the action you have after the watermelon and 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.890
 melons are not planned to travel on 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.889
 the city 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:50.400
 then how is it to say the toilet 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:55.569
 should be available and free 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:57.040
 otherwise you may go broke so you do n't 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.859
 she is not at all 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.049
 not combined and the audio guide just sat down and 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:04.510
 ate smoke i mean there are people practicing 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:07.480
 such things gone you start him out 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.609
 melon and if every day from the trouble is not very 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.739
 I feel good very quickly 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:14.919
 the season usually ends 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.630
 real season maximum two weeks all 

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:22.580
 the rest of the time is some kind of 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:24.710
 trick and watermelons same thing same 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.300
 we touched fruit fruit better not 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.020
 they don't like to mix with anyone 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.910
 mix 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.660
 but it's not fatal if you are something 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:37.010
 something is not mixed up that you die and 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:39.410
 fall off better there legs will be harder 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.180
 will pass for use tor no longer 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.490
 as much as I wanted 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:47.390
 vegetables are a very different thing between each other 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:51.710
 blends well but recommends that 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.870
 platter it mars 34 makes no sense huge 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.760
 amount of vegetables 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.860
 stir we will do today 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.680
 same and and see the framework this is done and i 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.700
 Today I will tell by algorithms 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.110
 I hope you do not run away stayed on 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.600
 practical lesson no sense theory 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.910
 heard about the reservoir but of course if you 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:14.209
 starvation agents 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:16.730
 so mix vegetables with fruit in 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.320
 principle is not very correct but again 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.350
 not fatal 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.350
 some know the principle of Ayurveda 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:29.990
 if you can't eat something don't eat eat 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:35.540
 really want to eat but less because 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:39.380
 what do you do with the forces the more 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:41.390
 pressure the more contradicted children 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.700
 on the power of opposition if i am something 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.360
 strongly refuse but I'm not talking about what 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.360
 here you go
