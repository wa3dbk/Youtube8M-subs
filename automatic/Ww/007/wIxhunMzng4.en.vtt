 jejeje friends of youtube that we are in 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.690
 a new video and good on this occasion 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.790
 something to bring rebellion 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.940
 and you have good framework called 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.800
 coordination also starts or commands 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:33.009
 Well that's how they already have so that we have 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.009
 commands like in minecraft pc and good 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.990
 then leave in the description all the 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:41.230
 commands and again after translated 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:46.239
 to Spanish this because he has the creator 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:49.330
 in English at the coordinates and good 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:52.600
 before the web and bring this the ones of some 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:55.390
 useful commands and shifts did not sit him down 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.720
 very well they serve but if you read the 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:02.820
 they investigate and all that and good 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:04.960
 First of all we have the command of Bio Bio 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.830
 bÃ­o me 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.630
 and it tells us is exactly in what language 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.659
 we are making it happen 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:19.210
 and good we're still here we have another 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.210
 which is being let's see 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.020
 with 2 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.420
 which is this command at the same time 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:31.090
 great as you can see but here the 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.090
 block of land and we put you 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:38.130
 this data 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.110
 and it does not say elite and systems and all that and 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.560
 good as you can report block is 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.190
 the 0 and if we are not going to go this way 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.020
 here 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:52.620
 and we put it again you know 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:54.600
 diagonal item data 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.350
 I do not know why now not me 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.350
 no selection 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.610
 I do not know what happened here but if you 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.220
 they select some block and they will 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.489
 appear there good let's take the 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.330
 base removing the controls what I did 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:14.000
 It was a good face 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.370
 we have another mode and another minus two others 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.910
 that allow us to fly in your rival with 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.910
 just put 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:27.360
 we put your law 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:29.549
 with this we can already fly south 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.800
 alive of which is also very very very 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:34.420
 cool 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:39.020
 and if we hurt ourselves this 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:42.760
 We have the one to fly to hurt us 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.760
 we put diagonal 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:49.590
 and ready regenerated how can you see life 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:52.459
 which is also this great mega 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:57.150
 and to deactivate what has been the 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:59.400
 polar we can only get line 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.950
 and now we can not fly another command 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.750
 what is being the gay game boat 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:09.580
 mode and 0 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:13.090
 and well that was numeral 1 and the 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.090
 modest 0 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.290
 we put and ready 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.240
 ok I do not know what's going on that is 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.689
 as you want 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:27.390
 what it smells can be again 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:29.329
 91 fuck fail good if we're in 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.180
 creative as they may be watching 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:34.680
 when here I have the fastest tumor and 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.010
 good 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.170
 another other coordinate also very cool 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.209
 is another coordinate comes with the 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.180
 coordinates that I have in mind another 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.370
 command that is being is the records 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.799
 and it does not say the coordinates where 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.290
 we stand there does not say the 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:54.200
 coordinates 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.520
 and good are some of the commands 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.750

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:03.650
 what do you have if you want you can see in the 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:06.320

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.600
 I'll leave them here in the 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.790
 description the commands so that 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.310
 you check it up translated to the 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:16.610
 Spanish and you are left here in what 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.980
 that is being second and macys and what 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:20.420
 such is and well everything will be the 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.430
