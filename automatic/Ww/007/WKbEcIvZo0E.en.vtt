00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
mobile phones of Android also like this

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.389 
mobile phones of Android also like this
Samsung<00:01:30.790> Galaxy<00:01:31.180> are<00:01:31.360> it<00:01:32.110> comes<00:01:32.350> with<00:01:32.619> a<00:01:33.070> touch

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
Samsung Galaxy are it comes with a touch

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:39.749 
Samsung Galaxy are it comes with a touch
of<00:01:33.430> five<00:01:34.000> total<00:01:34.330> five<00:01:34.869> touch<00:01:35.550> multi-touch

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:46.539 

this<00:01:40.759> is<00:01:40.909> 4<00:01:41.420> and<00:01:41.689> this<00:01:41.780> will<00:01:42.350> be<00:01:42.530> 5

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:51.370 

one<00:01:47.060> two<00:01:47.329> three<00:01:47.659> four<00:01:48.110> and<00:01:48.380> five<00:01:50.170> so<00:01:51.170> as<00:01:51.290> you

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
one two three four and five so as you

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:59.490 
one two three four and five so as you
can<00:01:51.500> see<00:01:51.680> this<00:01:52.159> was<00:01:52.399> for<00:01:53.049> this<00:01:54.049> would<00:01:54.259> be

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.889 

five

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.609 

so<00:02:04.320> these<00:02:04.469> are<00:02:04.679> five<00:02:05.250> at<00:02:05.909> once<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.899> this<00:02:07.530> is

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
so these are five at once and this is

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.109 
so these are five at once and this is
the<00:02:07.679> maximum<00:02:07.979> one<00:02:08.190> can<00:02:08.369> do<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.610> because<00:02:08.940> we

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
the maximum one can do it because we

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.309 
the maximum one can do it because we
tested<00:02:09.509> with<00:02:10.400> more<00:02:11.400> than<00:02:11.580> 500<00:02:12.269> didn't<00:02:13.110> show

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
tested with more than 500 didn't show

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.680 
tested with more than 500 didn't show
more<00:02:13.530> than<00:02:13.680> that<00:02:13.920> so<00:02:14.700> it's<00:02:14.879> one<00:02:15.150> of<00:02:15.300> five

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
more than that so it's one of five

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.800 
more than that so it's one of five
multi-touch<00:02:17.180> at<00:02:18.180> once<00:02:19.879> this<00:02:20.879> is<00:02:21.120> good<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.599> see

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
multi-touch at once this is good to see

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.039 
multi-touch at once this is good to see
how<00:02:22.140> money<00:02:22.410> that<00:02:23.400> can<00:02:23.970> be<00:02:24.180> supported<00:02:24.750> by<00:02:24.989> the

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
how money that can be supported by the

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.259 
how money that can be supported by the
mobile<00:02:25.410> phone<00:02:25.620> at<00:02:25.769> once<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.160> also<00:02:26.459> whether

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
mobile phone at once and also whether

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.850 
mobile phone at once and also whether
the<00:02:27.420> market<00:02:27.930> is<00:02:28.200> being<00:02:30.410> available<00:02:31.410> in<00:02:31.709> that

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
the market is being available in that

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.390 
the market is being available in that
form<00:02:32.160> so<00:02:32.840> this<00:02:33.840> was<00:02:33.989> an<00:02:34.110> easy<00:02:34.290> test<00:02:34.530> you<00:02:35.190> can

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
form so this was an easy test you can

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.520 
form so this was an easy test you can
get<00:02:35.610> that<00:02:35.790> through<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.269> antidote<00:02:36.750> esta<00:02:37.019> en<00:02:37.290> tu

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
get that through the antidote esta en tu

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.339 
get that through the antidote esta en tu
tu<00:02:37.739> gesture<00:02:41.660> will<00:02:42.660> be<00:02:42.780> showing<00:02:42.959> you<00:02:43.200> the

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
tu gesture will be showing you the

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.350 
tu gesture will be showing you the
