 principle sneakers which this year 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:36.380
 have become a little better 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:38.510
 become even more technological and about one 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.500
 technological finds I want to tell 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:43.370
 a little more 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:45.289
 this is the so -called flight plate here 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.700
 such is the layer that is inserted in 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:47.680
 yourself 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.930
 leave what is flight play flight 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.770
 plate is something like plate insoles 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:55.390
 which provides maximum 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.460
 energy return which is transmitted to 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:59.050
 sneakers made to 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.150
 athlete who plays this 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.570
 technologies could jump higher from them 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.860
 the jump was more rapid and 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:08.140
 a little pro flight as you understand 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.820
 flight is one of those eternal directions 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.890
 nike i was talking about yes there is 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:14.470
 force is a flight flight is more 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:17.290
 I do not force there and elasticity namely on 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:19.930
 quickly do everything and this flight 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:23.620
 plate was designed just to 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:26.200
 to have a few points to speed 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:28.930
 athletes have increased by the way flight 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:30.610
 plate in Carmelo Anthony's sneakers 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.790
 as evidenced by this small 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:35.830
 the filter here is a very interesting technology 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:38.050
 so if you are not a powerful player 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:41.700
