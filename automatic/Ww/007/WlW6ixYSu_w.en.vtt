00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.040
 with you again me close hello in this 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.469
 issue we will continue to review the history 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.209
 built British tanks if you're still 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.869
 did not watch the previous issue then 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:20.220
 be sure to look and we start 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.589
 the British did not refuse to create 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.660
 fundamentally new heavy tank because 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.820
 it was obvious that they had tanks 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.650
 this type is aging very quickly 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.599
 the concept of military experts new 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.189
 a heavy tank should have been reliable 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.329
 numerous armor protection 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.820
 armament for action in the rear 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.180
 adversary and well overcome trenches and 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.520
 ditches 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.250
 in the twenty-second year the project started 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.300
 engage vickers engineers 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.370
 introduced in twenty five year two 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.590
 options for a new heavy breakout tank 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.420
 one of them according to the task 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.699
 had weapons in the nose compartment 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.949
 and in two sponsons on the sides of the other 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.140
 distinguished by the presence of 5 towers installed 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.480
 on a very long chassis military 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.890
 chose the second option 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.570
 a year later, it began to build and 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.670
 finished in november twenty sixth year 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.379
 and then another six years were subjected 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.570
 every possible improvement while he 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.960
 finally not outdated tank got 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.910
 notation 11 and name independent 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.920
 which underlined his ability 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.960
 act independently of other machines in 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.910
 the depth of the enemyâ€™s defense was equipped 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.310
 four machine guns and one cannon 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.500
 turret of a circular shelling left rear 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.270
 the turret was installed in this way 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.700
 so that you can shoot from it 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.590
 aircraft thickness of armor was 30 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.180
 millimeters and speed despite 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.520
 heavy weight 32 tons 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.410
 was 32 kilometers per hour for that 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.960
 that time was a great indicator 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.940
 to achieve high speed tank 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.280
 equipped with a powerful 12-cylinder 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.420
 air cooled engine 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.190
 armstrong saddle applied 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.320
 hydraulic brake system and 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.330
 many improvements but all this 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.900
 led to the fact that the tank was too 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.190
 dear 12 thousand pounds sterling 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.140
 so from its production decided 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.960
 refuse as soon as england entered 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.910
 lingering economic crisis then this 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.920
 the tank was widely used in exercises and 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.570
 parades more often propaganda 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.930
 purposes rather than for real combat 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.880
 preparation 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.170
 many countries have also figured out for themselves 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.149
 necessary to create 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.150
 multi-turret machines on what were 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.620
 spent considerable effort and money 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.420
 enough to call Japan in many ways 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.300
 following the English tradition 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.760
 Germany and the USSR where exactly after 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.070
 on the appearance of the tank independent messages 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.390
 work began on the creation of 5 tower 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.790
 tank t-35 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.130
 had a similar layout but more 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.290
 strong weapons first years of the second 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.550
 world war when the British were waiting 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.740
 German invasion 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.690
 independent buried near the coast 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.580
 turning it into a fixed ford on 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.770
 one of the most likely directions 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.600
 enemy assault invasion not 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.400
 this tank has taken place now 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.750
 exhibited in the royal tank 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.180
 bowington museum 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.340
 when army spending was severely curtailed 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.110
 vickers tried to develop 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.060
 for military cheap and easy light 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.120
 tank which subsequently received 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.190
 name vickers 6 ton to twenty 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.410
 the ninth year he has already begun to experience 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.630
 and found out that the car turned out good 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.910
 in particular his manganese caterpillars 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.820
 Vista steel withstand mileage of about five 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.930
 thousand kilometers that was 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.000
 unprecedented tank indicator 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.980
 differed smoothness and reliability 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.959
 in operation the truth of his chassis 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.209
 calculated on a strictly defined 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.910
 weight and it could not hinder it 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.780
 modernization in the future the tank was produced in 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.360
 two options 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.160
 machine gun we had two machine gun turrets 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.320
 installed next as the first 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.780
 English armor centuries and cannon 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.519
 who had one tower and 47 millimeter 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.769
 gun and paired with a machine gun 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:38.019
 the British army refused to take on 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.690
 armament of the tank and in the end the company 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:43.690
 took up his sale of vickers 6 ton 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.900
 purchased bolivia bulgaria greece china 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.360
 Thailand and Finland under the symbol 7 tr. 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.950
 It is produced in Poland and in the USSR, he 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.040
 turned into t-26 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.140
 who got up the main tank of the RKK for all 30s 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.500
 years on this given release of transmission 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.640
 history of tank has come to an end 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.680
 be sure to put your fingers up and 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.079
 subscribe to the channel but fan or 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.769
 gave steve at the microphone was me close 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.769
 see you later
