00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
other things that I think I would

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.080 
other things that I think I would
appreciate<00:03:50.959> so<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.049> first<00:03:52.320> one<00:03:52.650> is<00:03:53.090> really

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
appreciate so the first one is really

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.560 
appreciate so the first one is really
cool<00:03:54.570> and<00:03:55.140> unique<00:03:55.650> teas<00:03:56.280> because<00:03:56.910> I'm<00:03:57.360> really

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
cool and unique teas because I'm really

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.870 
cool and unique teas because I'm really
into<00:03:57.840> tea<00:03:58.080> and<00:03:58.410> I<00:03:58.470> think<00:03:58.769> any<00:03:59.010> cool<00:03:59.400> teas<00:03:59.640> from

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
into tea and I think any cool teas from

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.850 
into tea and I think any cool teas from
like<00:04:00.090> Teavana<00:04:00.600> would<00:04:01.019> be<00:04:01.140> a<00:04:01.170> really<00:04:01.380> cool<00:04:01.650> gift

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
like Teavana would be a really cool gift

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.410 
like Teavana would be a really cool gift
because<00:04:02.250> those<00:04:02.430> are<00:04:02.579> more<00:04:02.700> on<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:02.880> expensive

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
because those are more on the expensive

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.330 
because those are more on the expensive
side<00:04:03.450> and<00:04:04.140> I'm<00:04:04.320> never<00:04:04.530> in<00:04:04.709> the<00:04:04.799> mood<00:04:04.980> to<00:04:05.190> buy

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
side and I'm never in the mood to buy

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.460 
side and I'm never in the mood to buy
like<00:04:05.579> a<00:04:05.670> $20<00:04:06.269> tea<00:04:06.570> like<00:04:06.810> I'd<00:04:06.930> rather<00:04:07.110> buy<00:04:07.320> like
