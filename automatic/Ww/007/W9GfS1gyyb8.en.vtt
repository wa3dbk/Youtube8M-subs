00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.629
 so we are at the limit butter in 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.970
 scene in front of the staff office with 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.290
 the general in hello hello hello 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.700
 are the commander who runs precisely 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.170
 that the vast camp how much of a 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.370
 how many men on this are five years in 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.170
 normal time actually I run the 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.460
 intelligence brigade and on the camp 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.279
 of oberhoffen us in about 2000 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.350
 people three regiments a 2nd regiment 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.619
 of hussars 28th geographical group and 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.689
 54 54th Signal Regiment and 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.460
 the staff of course and then again 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.890
 two thousand people one distributed to 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.900
 mutzig with the 44 40 4th in giant 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.790
 transmission and chaumont high marl 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.800
 the 61st artillery regiment 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.270
 so this camp where you open its doors 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.559
 this weekend we will talk about it in a 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.239
 moment to simply bounce off the 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.620
 about we just saw that we will 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.000
 the army always attracts so 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.040
 maybe a little bit different since 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.390
 especially the end of the conscription you 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.800
 perceive you too greet you 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.480
 precisely on this camp of 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.010
 framing people this is the thing 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.719
 which are a little bit the showcase you 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.579
 perceive this attraction that 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.050
 still works for the army yes I 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.899
 believe that the military always attract 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.940
 our youth because the offer well 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:05.820
 sure it's an exciting job 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:08.520
 with managing a community of men 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.780
 engaged around certain missions to 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.479
 around the world you know it well 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.860
 the news reminds us they serve 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.750
 equipment equipment 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.850
 last generation he acquires 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.580
 extremely meticulous know-how 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.680
 accurate it's a real job around 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.290
 which one can build a whole life 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.759
 and flourish totally would be that for 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.259
 young people who are interested in these 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.520
 areas there we were in the army that's 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.259
 have the guarantee of having access to 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.579
 low material almost the most sharp of 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.740
 ski little of what it can exist 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.980
 we can say it can be said in the 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.280
 domains that are ours 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.170
 we are only implementing one this 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.850
 very sophisticated type of equipment that 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.310
 really allows to bring a 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.450
 added value at the command we are 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.310
 in what is called the function 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.230
 anticipation knowledge and who has been 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.000
 dedicated by the White Paper on 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.410
 defense and national security and for 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.330
 the army land we implement 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.800
 this ability so these are 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.430
 actually last tools 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.960
 generation 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.460
 what can we see concretely 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.660
 on these days open doors 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.040
 open sorry I remember it's this 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.360
 weekend saturday and sunday what is it 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.260
 we will be able to see what are the 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.900
 proposed animations 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.640
 then you will of course have the different 

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.890
 regiments I quoted who will exhibit 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.360
 in the form of stands their abilities 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.770
 their mater their equipment their 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.480
 know-how their experiences 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.550
 operational you will have 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.310
 dynamic demonstrations of their 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.530
 activity you will also have a little bit 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.550
 a fair a new partnership with 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.930
 a number of Alsatian cities 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.750
 one who join us 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.250
 there will be one animation at a time 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.010
 in the military but also 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.720
 folk on the camp as to the 10 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.450
 intelligence and intelligence brigade 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.500
 transmission flight equipment around you 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.690
 especially on some images 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.340
 what is the main mission? 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.440
 What is intelligence is due to the 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.750
 listen to his techniques his tactics we 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.100
 have human research capabilities 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.230
 to make men who go on the field 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.550
 to seek intelligence or take 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.620
 contact with populations of 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.860
 authorities for maintenance 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.000
 conversational we have regiments 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.959
 of electronic warfare 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.910
 what's called intelligence 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.100
 of electromagnetic origin detecting 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.440
 signals and then we have a regiment 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.180
 stone imaging intelligence that is 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.950
 able to operate planes 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.020
 remote controlled so-called 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.209
 drones to go watch in the 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.890
 depth of devices for example 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.300
 and night and well it's to discover in 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.530
 part maybe not all this part 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.730
 it may not be completely covered at 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.020
 public the other case the oberhoffen camp 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.580
 night opens its doors to you remember 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.560
 the schedule is this Saturday and
