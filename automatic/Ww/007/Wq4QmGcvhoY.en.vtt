00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
between Bollywood and Hollywood no I

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.520 
between Bollywood and Hollywood no I
think<00:01:43.369> for<00:01:43.790> this<00:01:43.970> movie<00:01:44.270> in<00:01:44.479> particular<00:01:44.780> it's

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
think for this movie in particular it's

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.950 
think for this movie in particular it's
the<00:01:45.680> intentions<00:01:46.369> the<00:01:46.610> same<00:01:46.850> you<00:01:47.390> know<00:01:47.509> woman's

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
the intentions the same you know woman's

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.620 
the intentions the same you know woman's
in<00:01:48.170> love<00:01:48.350> with<00:01:48.530> the<00:01:48.740> man<00:01:48.920> and<00:01:49.310> you<00:01:49.850> know<00:01:49.970> the

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
in love with the man and you know the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.900 
in love with the man and you know the
other<00:01:50.810> woman's<00:01:51.229> sad<00:01:51.590> to<00:01:51.800> see<00:01:51.950> the<00:01:52.070> man<00:01:52.250> go<00:01:52.460> and

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
other woman's sad to see the man go and

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.300 
other woman's sad to see the man go and
so<00:01:53.450> I<00:01:53.479> think<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.900> intention<00:01:54.259> is<00:01:54.619> the<00:01:54.830> same<00:01:55.070> as

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
far as a romantic comedy but I think for

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.620 
far as a romantic comedy but I think for
the<00:01:58.009> Bollywood<00:01:58.430> movie<00:01:58.670> that<00:01:58.880> if<00:01:58.970> there's<00:01:59.240> just
