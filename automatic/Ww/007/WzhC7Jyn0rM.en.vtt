to<00:00:34.770> your<00:00:34.800> rhythm<00:00:35.579> playing<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.559> it's<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.860> great

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
to your rhythm playing and it's a great

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.670 
to your rhythm playing and it's a great
little<00:00:38.399> double<00:00:38.910> stop<00:00:39.149> thing<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.410> used

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
little double stop thing that is used

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.780 
little double stop thing that is used
all<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:40.950> time

all the time

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.380 
all the time
and<00:00:41.879> basically<00:00:42.540> I'm<00:00:42.629> just<00:00:42.690> thinking<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.350> as

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
and basically I'm just thinking of it as

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.569 
and basically I'm just thinking of it as
instead<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.570> bar<00:00:45.780> chord<00:00:46.140> this<00:00:46.770> major<00:00:47.219> Barre

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
instead of a bar chord this major Barre

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.860 
instead of a bar chord this major Barre
chord<00:00:47.610> or<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.690> seven<00:00:49.379> chord<00:00:50.149> either<00:00:51.149> one<00:00:51.539> you

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
chord or a seven chord either one you

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.689 
chord or a seven chord either one you
can<00:00:52.289> do<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.620> little<00:00:52.770> substitute<00:00:53.430> I'm<00:00:53.520> going

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
can do this little substitute I'm going

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.060 
can do this little substitute I'm going
to<00:00:53.760> show<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:53.940> instead<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.780> build<00:00:55.410> really

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
to show you instead and build really

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.670

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.800 
well so basically if I took this Barre
chord<00:02:11.250> which<00:02:11.459> is<00:02:11.489> rooted<00:02:12.090> on<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.209> eighth<00:02:12.510> fret

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
chord which is rooted on the eighth fret

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.809 
chord which is rooted on the eighth fret
right<00:02:13.110> there<00:02:13.319> and<00:02:14.099> I<00:02:14.160> just<00:02:14.370> took<00:02:14.489> the<00:02:14.610> Barre

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
right there and I just took the Barre

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.009 
right there and I just took the Barre
chord<00:02:15.090> off<00:02:15.269> and<00:02:15.690> played<00:02:16.560> just<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:17.610> upper

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
chord off and played just the upper

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.229 
chord off and played just the upper
structure<00:02:19.019> of<00:02:19.380> that<00:02:19.860> chord<00:02:20.220> but<00:02:20.730> I'm<00:02:20.849> changing

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
structure of that chord but I'm changing

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.860 
structure of that chord but I'm changing
my<00:02:21.330> fingering<00:02:21.690> now<00:02:21.959> so<00:02:22.560> I've<00:02:22.650> got<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:23.870> major

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
my fingering now so I've got a major

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.220 
my fingering now so I've got a major
chord<00:02:25.260> it's<00:02:25.440> a<00:02:25.530> C<00:02:25.739> major<00:02:25.980> I<00:02:26.720> said<00:02:27.720> root<00:02:27.989> on<00:02:28.110> the

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
chord it's a C major I said root on the

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.559 
chord it's a C major I said root on the
eighth<00:02:28.380> fret<00:02:28.590> right<00:02:28.860> there<00:02:29.099> so<00:02:29.760> middle<00:02:30.239> finger

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
eighth fret right there so middle finger

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.380 
eighth fret right there so middle finger
is<00:02:30.750> on<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.200> ninth<00:02:31.410> fret<00:02:31.590> of<00:02:31.769> the<00:02:31.799> G<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:32.400> then

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.770 
is on the ninth fret of the G and then
I'm<00:02:33.510> just<00:02:33.540> kind<00:02:33.900> of<00:02:33.959> barring<00:02:34.500> actually<00:02:35.780> the

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.869 

instead<00:02:54.060> of<00:02:54.530> right<00:02:55.530> so<00:02:56.099> watch<00:02:56.250> this<00:02:56.489> I'll<00:02:56.700> play

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
instead of right so watch this I'll play

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:04.490 
instead of right so watch this I'll play
a<00:02:56.909> C<00:02:57.209> major<00:02:57.450> chord

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.860 

then<00:03:05.070> up<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.610> an<00:03:05.730> e<00:03:06.090> bar<00:03:06.540> chord

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.910 

which<00:03:10.349> is<00:03:10.500> up<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:10.920> 12th<00:03:11.250> fret<00:03:12.590> in<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.709> a

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
which is up to the 12th fret in the a

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.900 
which is up to the 12th fret in the a
bar<00:03:14.190> chord

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.110 

which<00:03:17.390> is<00:03:17.540> now<00:03:17.660> on<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:18.110> fifth<00:03:18.440> fret

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
which is now on the fifth fret

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.350 
which is now on the fifth fret
then<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:20.840> D<00:03:21.019> chord<00:03:21.349> up<00:03:22.040> on<00:03:22.220> the<00:03:22.340> tenth<00:03:22.549> fret

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
then the D chord up on the tenth fret

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.400 
then the D chord up on the tenth fret
maybe<00:03:24.900> less<00:03:25.140> major<00:03:25.410> chord

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
maybe less major chord

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.380 
maybe less major chord
at<00:03:27.830> Fuji<00:03:28.400> court

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:38.910 

then<00:03:31.960> a<00:03:31.990> turn<00:03:32.530> around<00:03:37.560> you<00:03:38.560> get<00:03:38.709> the<00:03:38.830> idea

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
then a turn around you get the idea

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.650 
then a turn around you get the idea
launch<00:03:39.640> your<00:03:39.760> bar<00:03:39.940> chords<00:03:40.300> it<00:03:40.360> sounds<00:03:40.569> like

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
launch your bar chords it sounds like

00:03:40.660 --> 00:04:03.810 
launch your bar chords it sounds like
this<00:04:00.900> and<00:04:01.900> so<00:04:02.739> while<00:04:02.950> someone's<00:04:03.280> playing<00:04:03.550> that

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
this and so while someone's playing that

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.390 
this and so while someone's playing that
or<00:04:04.120> even<00:04:04.420> instead<00:04:04.989> of<00:04:05.140> it<00:04:05.290> you<00:04:05.770> can<00:04:05.950> do<00:04:06.220> that

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
or even instead of it you can do that

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.860 
or even instead of it you can do that
double<00:04:06.760> stop<00:04:06.970> technique<00:04:07.390> and<00:04:07.570> it<00:04:07.630> would<00:04:07.720> sound

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
double stop technique and it would sound

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.830 
double stop technique and it would sound
like<00:04:07.989> this

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
like this

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.540 
like this
and<00:04:10.840> now<00:04:11.110> you<00:04:11.170> can<00:04:11.440> do<00:04:11.530> any<00:04:11.739> combinations<00:04:12.430> of

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
and now you can do any combinations of

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.340 
and now you can do any combinations of
the<00:04:12.730> g<00:04:13.000> string<00:04:13.030> and<00:04:13.360> the<00:04:13.480> high<00:04:13.660> e<00:04:16.260> anything<00:04:17.260> you
