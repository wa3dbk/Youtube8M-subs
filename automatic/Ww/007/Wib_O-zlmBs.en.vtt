 revolverlab.com with an eye on technology 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.280
 hello everyone with you revolverlab.com me 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.590
 name is Nikita and everyone probably knows that 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.150
 The best complete earphones at apple and 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.190
 they are called earpods 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.320
 how what to do if corny is not enough 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.510
 on them money or don't want to wear them in 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.630
 the only available color in white 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.359
 the solution is the san francisco headphones from 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.430
 urbanista include better quality 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.859
 let's start the review in the previous video 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.720
 we already talked about two models from 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.510
 urbanists who were called paris and 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.250
 London and in this decided to compare 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.770
 san francisco from urbanista and earpods 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.809
 on the type of headphone box is not at all 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.760
 similar to each other unlike themselves 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.920
 headphone apple has developed its 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.870
 theropods for three years and when 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.300
 they saw the light as complete 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.460
 headphone iphone 5 this caused a noticeable 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.530
 effect among users first 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.180
 unprecedented still design which on 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.760
 really carries a complicated 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.850
 technical problem secondly he has a sound 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.070
 bass appeared deep real bass of what 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.260
 was not in all previous models and yet 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.150
 one fact apple didn't fundamentally 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.400
 make complete headphones vacuum 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.260
 type for sure yablonikov understand that 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.930
 vacuum headphones is not very comfortable 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.119
 let's start with external differences if 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.159
 have a quick look at both models first 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.110
 seem that they are identical but 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.090
 peering it becomes clear what 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.280
 the difference is firstly the proud inscription 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.520
 urbanista on the outside of the swedish 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.990
 headphones in the second hole in the case 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.930
 phase inverters are located differently further 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.280
 wiring earpods habitual white 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.829
 classic wire which is by the way very 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.750
 just dirty urbanista opposite 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.180
 wire noodles that is huge 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.130
 plus and as practice has shown get dirty 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.290
 he is slower besides in headphones from 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.450
 eppla weak point is the junction points 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.740
 headset headphone wires themselves and 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.810
 plug after some time 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.909
 use gum in these places once 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.890
 required as in our sample in my 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.170
 old headphones these gum in general 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.150
 began to fall off starts really have me 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.369
 San Francisco rubber is unlikely 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.350
 there will be no gum here 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.290
 wire tightly goes headphone housing 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.390
 headset and plug and last external 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.130
 the difference is the headset in the headphones from 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.170
 apple she is bigger and have a rocker 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.420
 adjust the volume to the model from 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.010
 urbanista smaller headset made of 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.350
 glossy plastic with details 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.330
 soft-touch coating but appearance thing 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.250
 secondary quality is much more important 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.940
 sound and convenience with daily 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.580
 using 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.709
 since the shape of both models is very similar 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.200
 we will not dwell on convenience 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.360
 Headphones are equally comfortable in Ufa and 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.100
 single airpods cover completely 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.350
 glossy so they can 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.090
 it is easier to slip out than san francisco 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.310
 its soft touch as for 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.500
 sound quality then with the characteristics you 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.840
 can view using the schedule 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.180
 which is as always located on the box 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.250
 Headphones from urbanista as for 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.630
 real tester we find fault with 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.400
 sound quality failed 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.260
 Especially in our editorial there is no 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.360
 audiophiles who can hear 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.470
 runes at saxophone or from what skin 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.870
 flute made 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.940
 If you compare the sound in two models, then 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.220
 the difference can be heard if you try 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.350
 you listened to three songs in different 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.380
 directions and came to the conclusion that apple 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.000
 earpods more calls a san francisco 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.980
 turbo something more bass 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.170
 only says the taste and color of everything 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.519
 markers are different so choose something 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.410
 what do you like best 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.170
 us to hear this difference 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.030
 it took three different tracks 30 minutes 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.040
 attentive listening and whole 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.410
 bucket of valerian to calm down after 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.780
 disputes san francisco turbo headphones not 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.209
 Worth a perfect alternative and ply 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.160
 the world of code waggled something even surpassed 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.359
 Cupertino for example in color 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.579
 wire palette 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:37.260
 rubber bands on the plug and headphones and 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:39.450
 Of course in the price you can order them 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.670
 will be by reference in the description and in 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.280
 comments write what music you 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.890
 listen on the way to work or on 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.319
 study or where to send if 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.220
 of course send where
