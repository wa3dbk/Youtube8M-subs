00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.660 
waterproof and so that's pretty much the
top<00:01:27.990> part<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.500> boot<00:01:28.650> let's<00:01:29.159> take<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.460> look

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
top part of the boot let's take a look

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.880 
top part of the boot let's take a look
at<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.850> sole<00:01:30.150> now<00:01:30.329> shall<00:01:30.659> we<00:01:30.689> say<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.229> just<00:01:31.470> flip

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
at the sole now shall we say I just flip

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.200 
at the sole now shall we say I just flip
it<00:01:31.950> up<00:01:32.070> like<00:01:32.220> them<00:01:32.340> as<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.850> can<00:01:32.939> see<00:01:33.030> it's<00:01:33.180> a

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
it up like them as you can see it's a

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.660 
it up like them as you can see it's a
nice<00:01:33.420> vibe<00:01:33.869> ramp<00:01:34.290> itself<00:01:34.619> now<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.130> see<00:01:35.549> this

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
nice vibe ramp itself now you see this

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.130 
nice vibe ramp itself now you see this
for<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.850> design<00:01:36.180> that's<00:01:36.420> actually<00:01:36.840> in<00:01:37.020> the

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
for a design that's actually in the

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.350 
for a design that's actually in the
middle<00:01:37.409> part<00:01:37.680> of<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.250> soul<00:01:38.670> itself<00:01:38.939> that

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
middle part of the soul itself that

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.510 
middle part of the soul itself that
actually<00:01:39.509> works<00:01:39.990> with<00:01:40.290> your<00:01:40.560> foot<00:01:40.950> so

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
actually works with your foot so

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.340 
actually works with your foot so
depending<00:01:42.060> on<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.390> pressure<00:01:42.780> points<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.200> what

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
depending on the pressure points of what

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.170 
depending on the pressure points of what
you're<00:01:43.500> walking<00:01:43.680> on<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.310> sole<00:01:44.579> will<00:01:44.729> actually

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
you're walking on the sole will actually

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.510 
you're walking on the sole will actually
react<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.770> can<00:01:46.920> see<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.070> slight

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
react to it you can see that slight

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.670 
react to it you can see that slight
flexing<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.180> solder<00:01:48.630> so<00:01:49.079> especially<00:01:49.619> if

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
flexing the solder so especially if

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.480 
flexing the solder so especially if
you're<00:01:49.799> heavy<00:01:49.979> footed

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
you're heavy footed

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.520 
you're heavy footed
this<00:01:50.909> might<00:01:51.149> be<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.329> nice<00:01:51.570> sole<00:01:51.960> for<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.229> might

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
this might be a nice sole for you might

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.289 
this might be a nice sole for you might
be<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.680> nice<00:01:52.860> nice<00:01:53.310> boot<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.759> actually<00:01:54.000> look<00:01:54.149> out

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
be a nice nice boot to actually look out

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.359 
be a nice nice boot to actually look out
and<00:01:54.540> definitely<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.960> try<00:01:55.259> on<00:01:55.530> other<00:01:56.070> than<00:01:56.250> that

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
and definitely to try on other than that

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.850 
and definitely to try on other than that
obviously<00:01:56.490> it's<00:01:56.850> got<00:01:57.000> nice<00:01:57.240> depth<00:01:57.860> variations

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
obviously it's got nice depth variations

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.319 
obviously it's got nice depth variations
of<00:01:58.950> depths<00:01:59.280> in<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.460> boot<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.880> obviously

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
of depths in the boot and obviously

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.060 
of depths in the boot and obviously
variations<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.079> cuts<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.619> designs

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
variations of cuts and designs

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.889 
variations of cuts and designs
obviously<00:02:02.610> this<00:02:02.759> basically<00:02:03.180> means<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.630> them

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
obviously this basically means that them

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.080 
obviously this basically means that them
you<00:02:04.320> can<00:02:04.560> or<00:02:05.070> should<00:02:05.430> we<00:02:05.490> say<00:02:05.640> no<00:02:05.790> matter<00:02:05.969> what

sort of terrain that you're walking on

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.080 
sort of terrain that you're walking on
it's<00:02:07.740> going<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.069> be<00:02:08.190> able<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.580> give<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:08.910> all
