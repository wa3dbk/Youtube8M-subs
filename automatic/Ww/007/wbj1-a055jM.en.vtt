00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hello everyone from luca today we are here for 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.700
 talk about the new product of the creators 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.410
 of records and we have sent our own 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.849
 stefano silvestri in london precisely for 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.160
 discover every detail of this 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.049
 very interesting and production before 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.410
 leave you I would like to remind you to follow 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.330
 eurogamer subÃ¬te was on facebook and up 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.900
 youtube as well as obviously on the site 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.320
 Internet 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.320
 good vision 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.940
 evolve birth the desire to turtle 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.350
 rock studios to explore new 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.910
 possibilities that revolve around the 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.170
 the for dead gameplay 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.690
 we are indeed talking about one 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.250
 cooperative 4-on-1 shooter in which 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.120
 a team the humans from the chase of 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.340
 fearsome monster 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.960
 the peculiarity of time is that also the 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.030
 our monster will be moved by a person 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.460
 in flesh bones those pros and cons of it 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.289
 can derive from other difference is 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.489
 which team of hunters will not be composed 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.129
 from characters only aesthetically 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.920
 different but will be divided into classes 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.390
 with distinctive weapons and skills the class 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.310
 that probably everyone will want to play 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.590
 it will be that of the jumper therefore 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.479
 the main concern is to do damage 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.850
 and for this it has a lightning 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.500
 ghana to be used at close range 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.119
 and an assault rifle for the long run 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.650
 radius 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.900
 interesting apps mines of the lines 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.119
 they do so much dunn and chris month there 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.830
 finds himself fighting in tight spaces 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.930
 while the personal shield will be vital 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.280
 when we will be attacked by the monster or 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.659
 the one who is playing the class of 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.100
 support is indicted for doing 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.509
 something else 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.460
 already because choosing the class 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.079
 will support we will have a chicane anyway 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.820
 protect our allies 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.110
 needless to say how good they found in 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.880
 this capital role for the 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.950
 party survival 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.630
 also because at its disposal the 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.939
 support to put a cross on a device 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.920
 which make himself invisible e 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.049
 members of his group within the small 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.030
 area if there was no one from 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.979
 protect some from bringing back to life the 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.930
 supports can instead distract you with 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.610
 everyone knows thanks to the wheel 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.799
 direction that will rain down from the gods 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.049
 missiles and heysel carter a weapon 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.119
 equally useful medium range is 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.890
 obviously the creation of music in the 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.140
 course of the test we have in fact used 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.239
 four very interesting weapons the first one 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.520
 it is the median with which to cure 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:17.520
 directly the other members even more 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.010
 below a short-range care area 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.989
 for the whole post but the curator then 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.000
 also stick with typhon antimatter 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.860
 a sniper rifle that to make the 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.750
 armor of the minister highlighting his 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.940
 weak points and the quiet heiser 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.370
 rifle with which to abolish and slow down 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.080
 from the crash the task of the trapper is 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.950
 instead to find and capture the 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.720
 monster 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.970
 the first thing to do and plant in 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.650
 sum spike terrain of the detectors in 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.989
 a movement that allows the group of 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.910
 highlight the enemy on the map one 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.069
 once identified better to use the mobile 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.780
 arena with the portable dome than for a 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.239
 short period of time in the trap 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.040
 monster in a small area out of stock the 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.519
 its effect is recommended to use the cun 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.620
 gun 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.540
 call it the target avoiding that if 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.950
 just go around and if it remains 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.720
 a few free seconds can be used 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.470
 even the machine gun to do some 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.480
 damage added wheels described i 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.550
 footballers it's time to talk about the monster 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.830
 what we could play with 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.019
 still a cross between king kong and 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.670
 godzilla his attacks are all 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.180
 body to body except for la 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.430
 possibility of exchanging of 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.319
 as the name of the game suggests 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.390
 over disbursements to evolve along three 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.709
 evolutionary stages at the first level e 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.569
 easily tackable 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.569
 second begins to become a bone 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:30.340
 tough and third and fiercely dangerous 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.900
 thanks to the fact that at the beginning it will be possible 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.909
 choose between two of the four skills 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.189
 available and that each level 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:38.409
 another will unlock the monster that was there 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:40.480
 automatically then spend time but 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:41.920
 will speed up eating evolution 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.139
 from the animals that are scattered 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.150
 on the map once the bar is filled 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:48.400
 of completion the black monster symbol 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.109
 for a few seconds in which it will be defenseless 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.909
 and much more vulnerable in blows than 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:53.859
 enemies 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:56.169
 the monster wins the game if it survives 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:58.329
 and 20 minutes or if it reaches the third 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:04:00.609
 level and the generating subjects for 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:02.019
 appear on the map doing so yes 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:04.060
 disable barriers that 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.769
 they protect civilians and will suffice for the 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.340
 monster kills them all so the 6 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.989
 game over 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.389
 obviously you can also win 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:12.040
 knocking out all the hunters but then yes 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:14.049
 they can be terminated three times 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.250
 and in any case they will return to the game later 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:17.259
 two minutes of waiting 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.940
 to further complicate things there 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:21.130
 will think of the mici in the network 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.620
 a game mechanic that will prevent you from 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.970
 always use the same moves 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.220
 decreasing in effectiveness if used 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.050
 it actually was this though 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.030
 immediately think that it is played with the 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.400
 right and respectful of their people 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.449
 role evolves may emerge a lot 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.099
 fun 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:38.590
 on the contrary if you meet a 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:40.810
 support that does not protect mates e 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.760
 a doctor who does not cure the situation 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.770
 could soon become enough 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.169
 the same may apply 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.030
 also with regard to moved in 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:50.470
 how if they meet skillful adversity 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.630
 able to use all his 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.340
 skills you will have a lot of games 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.080
 intense and fun 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.570
 on the contrary if you meet a 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.070
 opponent not particularly skilled la 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.050
 playing really scritturare 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.940
 few seconds 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.919
 at this point everything will depend on 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.980
 game modes proposed by the system 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:10.410
 of character progression 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.820
 making of and then point to this 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.270
 autumn make the game will be available 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.920
 for pc xbox one rs4 even if we are 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.210
 sure we will be back to talking well 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.210
 soon we easy months
