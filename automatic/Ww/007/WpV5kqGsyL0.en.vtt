00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
here is the right side of the rock face

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.890 
here is the right side of the rock face
and<00:03:04.160> this<00:03:04.820> is<00:03:04.970> considered<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:05.510> easier

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
and this is considered the easier

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.060 
and this is considered the easier
portion<00:03:06.440> of<00:03:06.560> it<00:03:06.940> the<00:03:07.940> difficulty<00:03:08.480> rating<00:03:08.690> is

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
portion of it the difficulty rating is

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:14.260 
portion of it the difficulty rating is
56<00:03:10.070> 57<00:03:10.820> 58<00:03:11.270> and<00:03:11.960> as<00:03:12.410> we<00:03:12.590> move<00:03:12.800> to<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:13.130> left<00:03:13.400> it

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
56 57 58 and as we move to the left it

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.950 
56 57 58 and as we move to the left it
gets<00:03:14.540> as<00:03:14.870> difficult<00:03:15.680> as<00:03:15.940> 513<00:03:16.940> this<00:03:17.780> is<00:03:17.930> a

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:17.960 
gets as difficult as 513 this is a

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.050 
gets as difficult as 513 this is a
little<00:03:18.140> bit<00:03:18.350> better<00:03:18.530> picture<00:03:19.160> of<00:03:19.190> the<00:03:19.760> easy

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
little bit better picture of the easy

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.910 
little bit better picture of the easy
stuff<00:03:20.450> that's<00:03:21.230> what<00:03:21.380> they're<00:03:21.470> calling<00:03:21.650> it<00:03:21.800> the

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
stuff that's what they're calling it the

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.230 
stuff that's what they're calling it the
easy<00:03:22.100> stuff<00:03:22.430> it's<00:03:22.670> the<00:03:23.420> 7<00:03:24.190> 57<00:03:25.330> 56<00:03:26.330> 57<00:03:26.930> 58<00:03:27.230> area

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.240 
easy stuff it's the 7 57 56 57 58 area

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.610 
easy stuff it's the 7 57 56 57 58 area
you<00:03:29.240> can<00:03:29.390> see<00:03:29.540> the<00:03:29.660> trees<00:03:29.900> growing<00:03:30.200> right<00:03:30.440> over
