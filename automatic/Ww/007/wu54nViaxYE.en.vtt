100% recycled glass bottles but as it

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.260 
100% recycled glass bottles but as it
just<00:00:21.910> makes<00:00:22.180> good<00:00:22.270> business<00:00:22.450> sense

we<00:00:27.840> also<00:00:28.020> buy<00:00:28.560> our<00:00:28.830> glass<00:00:29.070> from<00:00:29.430> groups<00:00:29.730> of

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:29.940 
we also buy our glass from groups of

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.069 
we also buy our glass from groups of
go-go's<00:00:30.270> in<00:00:30.600> different<00:00:30.960> parts<00:00:31.199> as<00:00:31.320> Westland

us<00:00:38.730> like<00:00:38.909> that

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.960 

our<00:00:49.350> production<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:49.920> very<00:00:50.160> labor-intensive

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
our production is very labor-intensive

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.799 
our production is very labor-intensive
because<00:00:51.630> all<00:00:51.870> handmade

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.840 

once<00:00:55.410> it's<00:00:55.620> cooled<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.100> has<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.370> be<00:00:56.489> cut

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
once it's cooled it has to be cut

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.779 
once it's cooled it has to be cut
polished<00:00:57.390> round<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.579> then<00:00:59.579> quality

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
polished round and then quality

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.009 
polished round and then quality
controlled<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.539> packaged

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:06.230 

so<00:01:04.019> you're<00:01:04.320> looking<00:01:04.409> at<00:01:04.650> 13<00:01:05.010> people<00:01:05.250> involved

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
so you're looking at 13 people involved

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:14.270 
so you're looking at 13 people involved
in<00:01:06.479> just<00:01:06.780> one<00:01:07.110> wineglass<00:01:12.860> looking<00:01:13.860> after<00:01:14.159> the

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
in just one wineglass looking after the

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.609 
in just one wineglass looking after the
environment<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.869> earth<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.320> we<00:01:16.470> live

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
environment and this earth that we live

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.149 
environment and this earth that we live
on<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:16.799> extremely<00:01:17.159> important<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.270> us<00:01:19.070> so<00:01:20.070> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
on is extremely important to us so the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.770 
on is extremely important to us so the
recycle<00:01:20.700> glass<00:01:20.790> was<00:01:21.149> the<00:01:21.270> first<00:01:21.509> thing<00:01:21.720> that

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
recycle glass was the first thing that

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.050 
recycle glass was the first thing that
we<00:01:22.020> did<00:01:22.259> but<00:01:22.649> as<00:01:22.830> we've<00:01:23.070> grown<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.340> company<00:01:23.520> we

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
we did but as we've grown the company we

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.789 
we did but as we've grown the company we
have<00:01:24.210> brought<00:01:24.540> on<00:01:24.750> more<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.290> more<00:01:25.350> green

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
have brought on more and more green

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.490 
have brought on more and more green
practice<00:01:26.460> one<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.630> we<00:01:27.869> use<00:01:28.110> recycled

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
practice one is we use recycled

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.730 
practice one is we use recycled
newspaper<00:01:29.280> as<00:01:29.340> part<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.700> our<00:01:29.850> production<00:01:30.740> we

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
newspaper as part of our production we

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.039 
newspaper as part of our production we
collect<00:01:32.190> all<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.820> rainwater<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.479> falls<00:01:33.659> off

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
collect all the rainwater that falls off

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.760 
collect all the rainwater that falls off
our<00:01:34.259> roof<00:01:35.659> one<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.780> our<00:01:36.869> progressive<00:01:37.229> thinking

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
our roof one of our progressive thinking

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.340 
our roof one of our progressive thinking
is<00:01:37.920> finding<00:01:38.369> better<00:01:38.670> ways<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:39.000> use<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.960> energy

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
is finding better ways to use the energy

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.620 
is finding better ways to use the energy
that<00:01:40.470> we<00:01:40.649> need<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:41.759> we've<00:01:41.909> implemented<00:01:42.330> a

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
that we need so we've implemented a

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.050 
that we need so we've implemented a
recycled<00:01:43.380> oil<00:01:43.470> program<00:01:43.920> not<00:01:44.069> to<00:01:44.280> fire<00:01:44.850> our

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
recycled oil program not to fire our

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.130 
recycled oil program not to fire our
furnace<00:01:47.300> although<00:01:48.300> we<00:01:48.420> only<00:01:48.569> use<00:01:48.780> clear<00:01:49.080> glass

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
furnace although we only use clear glass

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.800 
furnace although we only use clear glass
in<00:01:49.530> our<00:01:49.619> production<00:01:50.130> we<00:01:50.970> also<00:01:51.179> take<00:01:51.509> in<00:01:51.690> the

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
in our production we also take in the

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.230 
in our production we also take in the
green<00:01:51.990> brown<00:01:52.319> and<00:01:52.700> windowpane<00:01:53.700> wolf<00:01:53.970> cats

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
green brown and windowpane wolf cats

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.969 
green brown and windowpane wolf cats
which<00:01:54.630> we<00:01:54.899> put<00:01:55.229> through<00:01:55.440> our<00:01:55.560> crunching

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
which we put through our crunching

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.649 
which we put through our crunching
device<00:01:56.250> which<00:01:56.580> turns<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.060> glass<00:01:57.240> back<00:01:57.509> to

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
device which turns the glass back to

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.320 
device which turns the glass back to
sand<00:01:57.960> we<00:01:58.380> can<00:01:58.560> use<00:01:58.710> in<00:01:58.979> brick<00:01:59.310> making<00:01:59.789> we<00:02:00.179> can

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
sand we can use in brick making we can

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.719 
sand we can use in brick making we can
make<00:02:00.539> tabletops<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.470> terrazzo<00:02:02.009> flooring<00:02:02.340> and

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
make tabletops and terrazzo flooring and

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.020 
make tabletops and terrazzo flooring and
so<00:02:03.330> by<00:02:03.569> ironing<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.229> glass<00:02:04.409> back<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.890> sand<00:02:05.159> we

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
so by ironing the glass back to sand we

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:13.100 
so by ironing the glass back to sand we
complete<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.929> cycle

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.980 

so<00:02:13.770> busy<00:02:14.040> so<00:02:14.250> it<00:02:14.340> holds<00:02:14.700> us<00:02:14.820> all<00:02:14.940> together

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
so busy so it holds us all together

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.800 
so busy so it holds us all together
