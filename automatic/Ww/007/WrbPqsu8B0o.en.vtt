00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
Mike and I'm sorry this was supposed to

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.670 
Mike and I'm sorry this was supposed to
be<00:04:15.590> a<00:04:15.709> lot<00:04:15.920> more<00:04:15.950> epic<00:04:16.549> but<00:04:16.910> if<00:04:17.870> you<00:04:18.049> count<00:04:18.290> for

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
be a lot more epic but if you count for

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.490 
be a lot more epic but if you count for
the<00:04:18.859> walls<00:04:19.070> as<00:04:19.579> epic<00:04:20.329> then<00:04:20.750> I<00:04:20.780> guess<00:04:21.139> it<00:04:21.290> still

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
the walls as epic then I guess it still

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.469 
the walls as epic then I guess it still
counts<00:04:21.919> so<00:04:22.250> the<00:04:22.520> plot<00:04:22.700> that<00:04:22.940> that<00:04:23.180> definitely

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 
counts so the plot that that definitely

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:27.629 
counts so the plot that that definitely
