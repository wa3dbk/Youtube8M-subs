00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.109
 hey scales michael with you and what if every 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:10.110
 man on earth will jump into the same thing 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.519
 time would have caused this earthquake or 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.500
 something even impossible to describe 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.830
 words what about everything in order 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.869
 let's talk about the earth's rotation earth 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.330
 spinning that's why we have a day 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.310
 and night she spins quickly at the equator 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.430
 the earth is spinning at a speed greater than 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.130
 one thousand miles per hour and turning 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.640
 figure skater accelerates by moving 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.489
 its mass closer to the center of the earth is not 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.010
 different actually if you fall on 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.690
 land right now and move your 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.600
 mass closer to the center of the earth 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.890
 technically you speed up the rotation of the earth and 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.600
 make this day shorter and measure 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.149
 which we would spend with the rotation of the earth 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.670
 much less than we could believe 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.289
 Well, they can be calculated and the impact can 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.760
 be pretty impressive if 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.410
 talk about mass redistribution 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.160
 more than the mass of one person 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.640
 eg 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.439
 last year earthquake in Japan 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.339
 redistributed as much mass to 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.340
 center of the earth 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:13.530
 that since then every day has become one 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.810
 a whole 80s microseconds shorter but it's 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.659
 there was a significant geological event 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.369
 what can we humans do earth only 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.310
 on their own gio men 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.770
 now we have more than 7 billion what if 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.860
 we will all gather in one place and jump 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.509
 what would it look like 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.549
 I wonder what if you take all 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.829
 human population on earth and 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.540
 make them all live in the same place 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.350
 same density with which people live 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.619
 in New York 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.829
 you could put all of each of 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.720
 We wait for all as well, it is if people are 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.310
 live they just stand in a crowd that 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.790
 most likely will need to commit 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.159
 jump 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.960
 if all the living people on earth are right 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.909
 now stood shoulder to shoulder 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.210
 you could put all of us and in 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.960
 los angeles it would be incredible 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.969
 spectacle 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.790
 at least 500 square miles and 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:07.520
 contain every person on earth 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:11.900
 ok so then we jump what happens 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.390
 unfortunately not much fire between us 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.489
 all amazing people here on earth but 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.430
 our total mass versus mass 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:22.040
 whole lands she void actually dates 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.900
 the physicist figured out that if all of us 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.090
 gathered in one place everyone would jump 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.849
 30 centimeters air in one and the same 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.730
 time we would from h0 and land from us you 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.049
 only slightly 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.110
 the earth would have moved away from us only 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:39.650
 by about one thousandth width of one 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.690
 hydrogen atom and here's something else as 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.269
 we all jump and still fall 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.670
 back from where they started the earth also just 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.530
 will return to its place so our 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.180
 big jump can't change 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.370
 position of earth and in space 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.670
 oh well 7 billion people jump 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:58.269
 together this should cause some whiskey 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.269
 activity 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:25.940
 more people who so even if 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:28.609
 you're all so cool compared to 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.079
 we have so much land 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:32.030
 be so sad our 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.870
 a joint jump would contain a lot 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.060
 energy 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.160
 to finish to read that even if 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.000
 only people living in china gathered 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.000
 together and jumped 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.810
 their jump would be the equivalent of 500 anton 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.989
 we dnt of course 500 tons of explosives are not 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:52.000
 will do a lot of earth that weighs 6 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:54.370
 sextillion 588 quintillion tons 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.800
 to feel stronger 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:03.000
 select a card in my hands 10 say 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:06.140
 you chose the bouquet was congratulations we 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.660
 just destroyed this deck of cards 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.980
 why what because technically 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.550
 destroy does not mean wipe out 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:17.430
 land completely dc10 it means to take 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.890
 one tenth of something so next 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.140
 times when you have weight and everything is not 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.420
 I will develop very much and you only get 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:27.450
 10 percent yes of course this deuce 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:30.660
 but decided 10 percent right you 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.880
 We destroyed this test you, and as we 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:36.420
 talking about tops so let's talk about 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.890
 youtube youtube crowds audience points 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.780
 views that you watch under 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:43.440
 every video and look at the full 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:45.960
 picture we will start with the number danbar it 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.760
 estimate the maximum number of people with 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.440
 which we can have stable 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.570
 social relationships in this 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.210
 moment and it is based on the size of the penalty 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.550
 our brain is not just 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.750
 acquaintances are people with whom you have 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.820
 social contact 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.250
 network where you know how everyone relates 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:05.780
 someone else and usually these numbers are 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:08.610
 somewhere between a hundred and two hundred and 30 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:11.220
 which means that if the video on youtube 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.919
 gets more than 230 views from 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.930
 different people watched this video more 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:18.090
 people than you could 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.640
 hope that know and be good at given 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.419
 moment if you saw a sword more than a hundred thousand 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.550
 views 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:26.970
 from different people this video looked 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:30.390
 more people than you ever meet 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:32.130
 of my life and i will meet between 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.020
 shake hands with them know their names 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.020
 talk to them a little both think 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.310
 so you i 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:43.110
 statistically we will only live 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:45.540
 about 28 thousand 480 days so even 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.280
 if you met someone two three 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.990
 people every day of their lives 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.490
 including when you were a kid and 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.380
 Whether will meet as much as stvuyuschie 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.750
 how many people watched this video on 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.360
 youtube with 100 thousand views but 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.130
 remember that even if you or 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.960
 a large group of us can not do 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.990
 much to change position or 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.620
 earth rotation 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:07.840
 we can affect this a little third 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.570
 Newton's law guarantees it if you 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:13.060
 weigh 70 kilos the earth pulls you 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:16.000
 down force of 70 kilograms 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:19.540
 but also pulls you up on the surface 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.450
 land strength 70 kilograms if you 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:23.230
 you fall 3 meters the earth stretched you down 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.240
 3 meters 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:27.730
 but you are also with equal opposite 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.650
 force on the earth of course on 

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:32.110
 much bigger so if three fell out 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.660
 meters you stretched the ground up for about 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:37.720
 1 billion 0 proton width what's wrong 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:39.100
 bad and next time in the world 9 its 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.680
 body next tell about take 

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.510
 learn and think about it better to 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.980
 acted on the ground also what she 

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:48.220
 you worked you 

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:50.020
 a similar force is said at all a soul 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:54.310
 not dipper watch the newest channel 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:57.750
 claymore will type from my loved ones like earth 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.750
 Thank you for watching
