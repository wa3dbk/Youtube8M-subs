00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810 
believe is the closest thing to my

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.110 
believe is the closest thing to my
opinion<00:05:56.350> and<00:05:56.530> he<00:05:56.710> says<00:05:56.950> get<00:05:57.430> the<00:05:57.580> 15<00:05:57.970> inch

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 
opinion and he says get the 15 inch

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.260 
opinion and he says get the 15 inch
because<00:05:58.620> compared<00:05:59.620> to<00:05:59.710> a<00:05:59.740> 17<00:06:00.430> inch<00:06:00.460> it's<00:06:00.880> still

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
because compared to a 17 inch it's still

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.240 
because compared to a 17 inch it's still
pretty<00:06:01.660> much<00:06:01.870> portable<00:06:02.440> whereas<00:06:02.710> a<00:06:02.740> 17<00:06:03.220> inch

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250 
pretty much portable whereas a 17 inch

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:04.770 
pretty much portable whereas a 17 inch
is<00:06:03.580> really<00:06:03.880> more<00:06:04.000> of<00:06:04.120> a<00:06:04.180> desktop<00:06:04.600> replacement

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:04.780 
is really more of a desktop replacement

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.960 
is really more of a desktop replacement
