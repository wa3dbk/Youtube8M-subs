00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.490 
speed boost iPhone 5s was to the guy
from<00:02:35.210> five<00:02:35.420> I<00:02:35.450> mean<00:02:35.750> if<00:02:35.900> you<00:02:35.990> look<00:02:36.170> at<00:02:36.320> the

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
from five I mean if you look at the

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.530 
from five I mean if you look at the
specs<00:02:37.370> about<00:02:37.880> the<00:02:38.030> things<00:02:38.300> that<00:02:38.390> they

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
specs about the things that they

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.990

upgraded that's amazing I mean that they

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.550 
upgraded that's amazing I mean that they
really<00:02:41.330> were<00:02:41.450> thinking<00:02:41.900> about<00:02:42.020> that<00:02:42.350> like

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
really were thinking about that like

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.890 
really were thinking about that like
performing<00:02:43.550> better<00:02:43.730> and<00:02:44.300> the<00:02:44.570> you<00:02:44.630> can<00:02:44.780> see

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
performing better and the you can see

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.680 
performing better and the you can see
also<00:02:45.080> that<00:02:45.230> for<00:02:45.500> a<00:02:45.710> five<00:02:46.100> no<00:02:46.880> I<00:02:47.120> wanna<00:02:47.450> see

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
also that for a five no I wanna see

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.080 
also that for a five no I wanna see
Apple<00:02:48.170> it's<00:02:49.010> because<00:02:49.370> they<00:02:49.520> have<00:02:49.700> this<00:02:49.910> a

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
Apple it's because they have this a

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.900 
Apple it's because they have this a
instead<00:02:50.900> of<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:51.080> name<00:02:51.320> 85<00:02:51.920> this<00:02:52.400> sounds<00:02:52.850> like

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
instead of the name 85 this sounds like

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.350 
instead of the name 85 this sounds like
an<00:02:53.150> 86<00:02:53.810> I<00:02:53.930> mean<00:02:54.050> a<00:02:54.170> 6<00:02:54.410> processor<00:02:55.000> they<00:02:56.000> kind<00:02:56.330> of

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
an 86 I mean a 6 processor they kind of

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.170 
an 86 I mean a 6 processor they kind of
sound<00:02:56.600> like<00:02:56.690> Apple<00:02:57.200> so<00:02:58.040> this<00:02:58.220> one<00:02:58.400> is<00:02:58.640> gonna

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
sound like Apple so this one is gonna

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.990 
sound like Apple so this one is gonna
finish<00:02:59.780> up<00:03:00.230> actually<00:03:00.830> not<00:03:01.010> last

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.180 

14:26<00:03:05.000> in<00:03:05.330> the<00:03:05.420> model<00:03:05.720> score<00:03:06.020> score<00:03:06.290> overall

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
14:26 in the model score score overall

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.180 
14:26 in the model score score overall
so<00:03:08.000> it<00:03:08.330> gets<00:03:08.600> actually<00:03:09.170> a<00:03:09.500> little<00:03:09.980> bit

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
so it gets actually a little bit

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.050 
so it gets actually a little bit
stronger<00:03:10.790> score<00:03:11.300> than<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:11.540> iPhone<00:03:12.080> 5<00:03:12.640> but<00:03:13.640> we

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
stronger score than the iPhone 5 but we

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.360 
stronger score than the iPhone 5 but we
all<00:03:14.180> know<00:03:14.390> that<00:03:14.450> in<00:03:14.720> gaming<00:03:15.380> the<00:03:15.860> iPhone<00:03:16.160> 5

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
iPhone remember iPhone is running on a

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.040 
iPhone remember iPhone is running on a
very<00:03:33.320> optimized<00:03:33.860> platform<00:03:34.550> so<00:03:35.000> it's<00:03:35.600> probably

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
very optimized platform so it's probably

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.620 
very optimized platform so it's probably
gonna<00:03:36.170> you<00:03:36.620> know<00:03:36.970> still<00:03:37.970> gonna<00:03:38.090> crush<00:03:38.390> it<00:03:38.570> up

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
gonna you know still gonna crush it up

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.380 
gonna you know still gonna crush it up
won't<00:03:38.840> probably<00:03:39.019> look<00:03:39.560> very<00:03:40.010> powerful<00:03:40.430> a<00:03:40.610> five

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
won't probably look very powerful a five

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.070 
won't probably look very powerful a five
and<00:03:41.780> a<00:03:42.769> is<00:03:43.730> around<00:03:44.090> the<00:03:44.360> level<00:03:44.630> on<00:03:44.690> the<00:03:44.810> iPhone

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
and a is around the level on the iPhone

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.229 
and a is around the level on the iPhone
5<00:03:45.290> but<00:03:45.830> then<00:03:45.980> again<00:03:46.100> the<00:03:46.310> iPhone<00:03:46.580> folks<00:03:46.820> also<00:03:47.209> a

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
5 but then again the iPhone folks also a

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.330 
5 but then again the iPhone folks also a
very<00:03:47.510> optimized<00:03:48.110> environment<00:03:48.680> is<00:03:48.830> losing

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
very optimized environment is losing

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.430 
very optimized environment is losing
games<00:03:49.750> then<00:03:50.750> again<00:03:50.959> you<00:03:51.019> get<00:03:51.140> a<00:03:51.200> bigger

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
games then again you get a bigger

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.490 
games then again you get a bigger
