used to okay so let me explain at the
beginning<00:00:34.500> when<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.219> start<00:00:35.250> out<00:00:35.730> any<00:00:36.239> halfway

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
beginning when you start out any halfway

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.690 
beginning when you start out any halfway
decent<00:00:36.960> whose<00:00:37.560> team<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:38.100> going<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.370> go<00:00:38.490> ahead

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
decent whose team is going to go ahead

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.790 
decent whose team is going to go ahead
and<00:00:38.850> get<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.150> some<00:00:39.360> great<00:00:39.660> results<00:00:39.870> the

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
and get you some great results the

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.530 
and get you some great results the
reason<00:00:41.130> for<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.400> is<00:00:41.850> because<00:00:42.060> weight

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
reason for that is because weight

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.050 
reason for that is because weight
training<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.290> completely<00:00:44.130> new<00:00:44.430> stimuli<00:00:45.000> for

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:45.060 
training is a completely new stimuli for

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.720 
training is a completely new stimuli for
your<00:00:45.480> body<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:46.050> your<00:00:46.560> nervous<00:00:46.920> system<00:00:47.340> has<00:00:47.550> to

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
your body and your nervous system has to

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.910 
your body and your nervous system has to
get<00:00:47.850> used<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.540> as<00:00:48.720> it<00:00:48.930> gets<00:00:49.110> used<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.649> it

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
get used to it as it gets used to it it

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.190 
get used to it as it gets used to it it
sends<00:00:50.130> a<00:00:50.310> signal<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.850> brain<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.899> go<00:00:52.050> ahead

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.200 
sends a signal to the brain to go ahead

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.770 
sends a signal to the brain to go ahead
and<00:00:52.500> activate<00:00:52.700> some<00:00:53.700> muscle<00:00:54.030> growth<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.660> be

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
and activate some muscle growth to be

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.340 
and activate some muscle growth to be
able<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.370> perform<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.700> exercises<00:00:57.570> better<00:00:57.989> and

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
able to perform the exercises better and

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.040 
able to perform the exercises better and
that's<00:00:59.250> how<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.489> go<00:00:59.760> ahead<00:00:59.880> and<00:01:00.239> adapt<00:01:00.570> you

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
that's how you go ahead and adapt you

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.880 
that's how you go ahead and adapt you
add<00:01:01.500> some<00:01:01.890> new<00:01:02.070> muscle<00:01:02.520> they<00:01:03.180> get<00:01:03.390> hard<00:01:03.890> the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
add some new muscle they get hard the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.800 
add some new muscle they get hard the
muscles<00:01:05.280> learn<00:01:05.549> how<00:01:05.759> to<00:01:05.790> pick<00:01:06.180> up<00:01:06.299> more<00:01:06.600> weight

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
muscles learn how to pick up more weight

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.300 
muscles learn how to pick up more weight
and<00:01:07.140> so<00:01:07.860> on<00:01:08.009> and<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.310> forth<00:01:08.670> okay<00:01:09.620> the<00:01:10.620> initial

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
and so on and so forth okay the initial

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.580 
and so on and so forth okay the initial
weight<00:01:12.090> training<00:01:12.420> routine<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.200> first<00:01:13.409> one

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
weight training routine the first one

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
your body's kind of lazy in the sense

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.810 
your body's kind of lazy in the sense
that<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.670> really<00:01:27.210> need<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.979> push<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.220> for<00:01:29.729> it

to go ahead and make some make some new

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.719 
to go ahead and make some make some new
muscle<00:01:33.689> growth<00:01:33.920> it<00:01:34.920> wants<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.369> save<00:01:35.549> energy

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
muscle growth it wants to save energy

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.090 
muscle growth it wants to save energy
wants<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.330> remain<00:01:36.810> in<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.049> state<00:01:37.080> state<00:01:37.920> of

wants to remain in a state state of

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.359 
wants to remain in a state state of
homeostasis<00:01:38.790> which<00:01:39.030> means<00:01:39.510> that<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:40.560> does<00:01:41.040> not

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
homeostasis which means that it does not

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.600 
homeostasis which means that it does not
want<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.760> change<00:01:42.060> okay<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.439> do<00:01:43.710> anything

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
want to change okay so do anything

want to change okay so do anything
possible<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.299> adapt<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.990> routine<00:01:46.350> that

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
possible to adapt to the routine that

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.560 
possible to adapt to the routine that
you're<00:01:46.650> giving<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.310> then<00:01:48.210> stop<00:01:48.450> the

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
you're giving it and then stop the

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.130 
you're giving it and then stop the
changes<00:01:49.049> alright<00:01:49.530> because<00:01:50.400> of<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:51.150> it<00:01:51.900> is

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
changes alright because of that it is

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.469 
changes alright because of that it is
imperative<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.369> change<00:01:53.670> your<00:01:54.030> routines

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
imperative that you change your routines

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.100 
imperative that you change your routines
often<00:01:55.140> okay<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:55.979> this<00:01:56.520> becomes<00:01:56.939> even<00:01:57.869> more

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
often okay and this becomes even more

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.080 
often okay and this becomes even more
important<00:01:58.770> for<00:01:59.070> very<00:01:59.580> advanced<00:01:59.880> athletes
