00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.080 
with the weight everybody has you know
got<00:01:45.040> in<00:01:45.190> a<00:01:45.250> battle<00:01:45.550> with<00:01:45.580> weight<00:01:45.850> it<00:01:45.970> was

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
got in a battle with weight it was

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.820 
got in a battle with weight it was
really<00:01:46.720> a<00:01:46.750> technical<00:01:47.260> thing<00:01:47.290> trying<00:01:47.770> to

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
really a technical thing trying to

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.100 
really a technical thing trying to
lighten<00:01:48.070> up<00:01:48.190> the<00:01:48.250> boot<00:01:48.550> and<00:01:48.580> you<00:01:49.360> know<00:01:49.450> I<00:01:49.750> think

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
lighten up the boot and you know I think

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.600 
lighten up the boot and you know I think
we<00:01:50.200> lost<00:01:50.350> a<00:01:50.530> little<00:01:50.650> bit<00:01:50.770> of<00:01:50.830> comfort<00:01:51.070> I<00:01:51.280> think

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
we lost a little bit of comfort I think

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.830 
we lost a little bit of comfort I think
you<00:01:51.700> lost<00:01:51.850> a<00:01:52.030> little<00:01:52.180> bit<00:01:52.360> of<00:01:52.420> the

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
you lost a little bit of the

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.959 
you lost a little bit of the
the<00:01:53.229> actual<00:01:53.649> performance<00:01:54.219> and<00:01:54.429> technical

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:54.969 
the actual performance and technical

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:56.940 
the actual performance and technical
side<00:01:55.149> of<00:01:55.270> the<00:01:55.329> boot<00:01:55.479> so<00:01:56.079> we've<00:01:56.409> kind<00:01:56.859> of

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
side of the boot so we've kind of

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.289 
side of the boot so we've kind of
stepped<00:01:57.250> back<00:01:57.429> from<00:01:57.460> that<00:01:57.759> a<00:01:57.789> little<00:01:58.060> bit<00:01:58.149> it's

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
stepped back from that a little bit it's

00:01:58.299 --> 00:01:59.700 
stepped back from that a little bit it's
not<00:01:58.450> as<00:01:58.570> light<00:01:58.750> of<00:01:58.869> some<00:01:59.020> of<00:01:59.109> our<00:01:59.259> old<00:01:59.409> skates

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
not as light of some of our old skates

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.770 
not as light of some of our old skates
but<00:02:00.429> at<00:02:00.850> the<00:02:00.939> same<00:02:01.119> time<00:02:01.299> we've<00:02:01.509> really

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
but at the same time we've really

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:02.969 
but at the same time we've really
improved<00:02:01.869> the<00:02:02.170> comfort<00:02:02.530> we've<00:02:02.710> really

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
improved the comfort we've really

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.529

improved<00:02:03.069> the<00:02:03.429> durability<00:02:03.789> and<00:02:04.119> the

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
improved the durability and the

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:06.630 
improved the durability and the
performance<00:02:04.990> of<00:02:05.049> this<00:02:05.170> skate<00:02:05.439> is<00:02:05.590> to<00:02:06.219> medicine
