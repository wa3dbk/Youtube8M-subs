00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:05.240
 yes Hello my YouTube friends after a long time in the me then too 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.910
 again 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.459
 I am for new Speaker Stocker wants 

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:12.819
 the artificial with channel on YouTube 

00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:14.479
 my concern should be 

00:00:14.479 --> 00:00:16.009
 there is still 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:19.079
 a lot of problems in things even in vain 

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:23.749
 some people just mean when I'm against the five speakers on one 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:25.039
 Connect the channel 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:26.789
 it was not us either 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.050
 it is beautiful 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.050
 from the left out and he is a user especially in engines 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.700
 Xerox Europe is a bit more than just one channel 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.880
 For the first time, the least is 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.360
 but four channels of the Elbe Luxus had yet to be drafted a set 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.370
 usually easy 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.300
 but not 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.640
 "If I always like that 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.640
 You can also be public for the first time four years later 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.410
 what exactly is not a window now and saw 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.810
 It should be said quite simply by the evening 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.320
 the sound 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.320
 the normal stereo sound ended split 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.510
 in front of the ex-boss goal 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.500
 and the song feeling decorated so that could easily figure out says 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.590
 Filzmaier 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.620
 a little bit like himself but on the 8th 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.640
 Furthermore, there are of course the so-called so builds 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.000
 In any case, it must be completely separate from the front 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.970
 this means 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.300
 finally so homework 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.300
 only the skin is commenting on the sector 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.060
 such as watching football, we come from these projects 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.260
 Gräfelfing the singer 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
 on the first formula-1-test day a comment by the commentator 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.150
 the next change at Lausanne CAS in Lausanne 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.890
 The vote should come as far as possible this year 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.890
 if I just made stereo here now 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.359
 can not that look like this anymore 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:15.099
 Then that's how it is 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:16.759
 one of the goal 

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:20.239
 this is now a small sofa this custom van Buyten 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.239
 how long the informant continues 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.889
 why should I put something of the galleries Wilfried 

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:28.889
 that was complete nonsense the day before yesterday 

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:33.759
 It just was not the right attitude, therefore 

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:36.219
 because now 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:39.219
 the wrong attitude 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:42.449
 then that would not be all 

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:45.569
 many people make the body better 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:46.849
 Use louder 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.329
 and then says she was the jackpot wanders to the Swiss 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:55.139
 It simply had to miss the right attitude 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:58.379
 which make the chapel more and more suppressed 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:02.859
 the amplifier is Henry Mask tread is it 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:06.099
 where not every speaker is suitable for bass reproduction 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:10.170
 in this model here the fair, as you can say the amp what 

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:10.969
 noticed 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:12.979
 this is just a small speaker 

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:16.149
 then the TIG Themis did not rush with a deep bass 

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:17.149
 on the chain 

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:20.819
 the tournament starts from which one individually steer so still not round 

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:24.009
 times in a row on now 111 said 

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:25.369
 so be sure 

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:27.709
 just like the depth of his documents 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.129
 not said about the little one 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:31.259
 hopefully 

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:34.339
 the CEO has the amplifier and the death too 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.009
 But now come to Huber 

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:40.749
 Daruper 

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:43.749
 some people simply plug in the whopping 4 with a friend channel 

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:47.439
 nice and good you can do 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:51.349
 but you really need a corresponding percentage, says Huber 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:54.349
 should 

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:03.479
 Neumann 

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:06.479
 No one announced anything now 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:09.379
 that is a 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:10.579
 there should only 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:12.819
 the best called Rene Heights 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.409
 and no effort but really only 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:18.409
 Title Köhler 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.309
 but that was that 

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:32.309
 stop immediately 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:37.560
 now comes too 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.520
 on it can 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.509
 how to set the organizer 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:43.569
 "It does not help me if I take the form of written examination of the case 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.300
 and nothing 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.910
 for her it should be like this 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.910
 be split depending on their destination port 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.099
 and how to say on the amplifiers 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:00.569
 the forest is the man of which form a higher position way 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.530
 because the fighting did not do much for 4 017, the losses only knew 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.009
 change times 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:11.419
 Especially for Märklin in both hands hold Gleisdorf then you should 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:13.050
 just have a look 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.020
 Levi 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.199
 Judge put the LOSV which form 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:19.770
 loud place in the seat away 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.449
 al-fil reinforces the set if you can not adjust 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.919
 but did not break and had to 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:33.559
 other furniture to back under their fans that we then still in the 

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:34.689
 that carries gene 

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:37.419
 Well that was it for the first time to my part 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:39.660
 if we have any other questions 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.339
 concern this topic 

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:43.839
 to write more efficient comments 

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:46.340
 Everything answers everything clearly 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.920
