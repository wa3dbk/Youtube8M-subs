good<00:01:51.110> for<00:01:51.320> me<00:01:51.409> cuz<00:01:52.010> I<00:01:52.130> used<00:01:52.280> to<00:01:52.370> fight<00:01:52.580> all<00:01:52.610> the

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
good for me cuz I used to fight all the

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.800 
good for me cuz I used to fight all the
screws<00:01:53.060> in<00:01:53.180> another

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810

I'm<00:01:54.810> not<00:01:55.110> fighting<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.500> street<00:01:55.680> that's<00:01:55.830> good

I'm not fighting the street that's good
hopefully<00:01:56.870> one<00:01:57.870> of<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.020> reasons<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.530> we

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
hopefully one of the reasons is that we

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.080 
hopefully one of the reasons is that we
can<00:01:59.010> attract<00:01:59.370> some<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.700> some<00:01:59.910> of<00:01:59.970> these

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
can attract some of some of these

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.660 
can attract some of some of these
individuals<00:02:00.720> and<00:02:00.900> then<00:02:01.140> maybe<00:02:01.680> we<00:02:02.280> find<00:02:02.550> the

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
individuals and then maybe we find the

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.180 
individuals and then maybe we find the
diamond<00:02:02.970> in<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.180> rough<00:02:03.360> there<00:02:03.570> somewhere<00:02:04.190> we

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
diamond in the rough there somewhere we

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.190 
diamond in the rough there somewhere we
want<00:02:05.340> people<00:02:05.580> to<00:02:05.730> be<00:02:05.820> able<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.180> see<00:02:06.810> beyond

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
want people to be able to see beyond

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.520 
want people to be able to see beyond
their<00:02:07.410> circumstances<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:09.020> hopefully<00:02:10.020> give

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
their circumstances and hopefully give

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.110 
their circumstances and hopefully give
them<00:02:10.560> something<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:11.009> look<00:02:11.040> forward<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.700> I

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
them something to look forward to I

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.560 
them something to look forward to I
don't<00:02:12.810> think<00:02:13.140> their<00:02:13.560> mission<00:02:13.980> is<00:02:14.070> to<00:02:14.100> create

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
don't think their mission is to create

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.440 
don't think their mission is to create
people<00:02:15.570> to<00:02:15.780> go<00:02:15.900> out<00:02:16.020> there<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.410> just<00:02:16.800> kind<00:02:17.100> of
