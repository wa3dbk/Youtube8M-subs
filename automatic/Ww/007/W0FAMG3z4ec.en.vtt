00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 and Negro fool hen crayfish to take 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.450
 mounted on rubber and cushion 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:14.630
 who would not say this pillow hans 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.630
 pries three years goes and is not torn 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:22.800
 how to choose the type of insulation so what 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.949
 means vacuum system vacuum 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.769
 the system connects through two unions 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:29.060
 this sapp by this valve from the side 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.189
 collectors 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.890
 i.e. there must be 2 that c1 has broken off 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.590
 connected through the cache 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.550
 to one that is one step leaves 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:47.489
 there were burning trambler that is 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:50.969
 so another hose goes to the receiver to 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:58.710
 drive and then goes to the membrane 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:01:02.960
 launcher so on went on 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.640
 the solenoid hose is turned on 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.240
 this valve is in charge of 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:14.040
 short-term maintenance of turns at 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.360
 sudden discharge of gas turnover hangs on 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.310
 share on such and such 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.900
 for some time around 1700 rpm 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:30.770
 i.e. this valve 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:36.560
 the hose goes here this membrane plus 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:42.530
 disappears and the membrane is absorbed 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.530
 opens the first bag which gives 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:52.159
 So 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:52.159
 top fitting on the left side 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:00.570
 connects the membrane 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:09.750
 you open the second bag 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:16.310
 2 cameras below the fitting between the hose 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:18.049
 goes here connects the valve which 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:23.959
 responsible for 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:30.709
 cold or hot air intake 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:37.849
 membranes can be checked just roll 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:37.849
 Sasa all hose with pass through the membrane 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.590
 electrical connection 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:54.140
 this valve law as said at 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:58.170
 falling on when plus 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:00.060
 voltage when there is no this valve should 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.930
 open we can also check 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:07.970
 serviceability of this valve is brane all 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:14.130
 can check thinking creating a vacuum 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:18.620
 all on the air hose so this plus 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.620
 goes on 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.910
 valve idling 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:31.020
 that is, if there are no pluses idle 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:35.440
 can not just check 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.250
 spanish puna ring connector on 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.680
 Idling 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:42.310
 Give must die also need to 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.360
 attention is given to suit if mass is not 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.400
 or she whom on 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:55.020
 the car will twitch to stall so here 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:59.200
 one more plus this plus goes to the hedgehog 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:07.080
 puke or collector here so here it is 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:07.080
 From below it is inserted like this hedgehog 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:15.250
 stuff powerful enough 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:17.739
 4 contact and worth 4 of these 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:21.790
 heating elements I don't know what 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:26.640
 this is what the west will tell more 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:32.310
 hedgehog resistance should be 0 25 05 m 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:34.570
 powerful thing that is if these minds are not 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.410
 definitions above can be parsed and 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:41.290
 to clean 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:48.340
 end of contact, otherwise greetings will be 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:53.400
 not as it should be heated for 5 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:59.610
 degrees here for this conclusion reaper 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:03.010
 this sensor thanks to this thing 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:07.650
 cars can start in any frost and 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:12.120
 the viewer could return ie he does not give 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.120
 fuel condenses on the manifold 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:20.100
 when it reaches 60 degrees remains 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:23.580
 just donating from the reception pipe into this 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.580
 empty pipe and 

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:39.400
 engine cooling system 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:41.610
 choke passes through the manifold output 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.610
 everything
