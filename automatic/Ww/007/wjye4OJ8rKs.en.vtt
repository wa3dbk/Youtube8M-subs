00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
think that that they would fight each

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.010 
think that that they would fight each
other<00:01:20.670> like<00:01:21.000> on<00:01:21.149> the<00:01:21.299> way<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.600> hardpoint

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
other like on the way to the hardpoint

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.679 
other like on the way to the hardpoint
not<00:01:22.920> that's<00:01:23.310> not<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.490> way<00:01:23.579> it<00:01:23.609> works<00:01:23.789> like<00:01:24.539> the

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
not that's not the way it works like the

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.330 
not that's not the way it works like the
game<00:01:24.840> usually<00:01:25.049> usually<00:01:25.380> spawns<00:01:25.770> them<00:01:26.070> like<00:01:26.189> on

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
game usually usually spawns them like on

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.800 
game usually usually spawns them like on
one<00:01:26.549> at<00:01:26.670> one<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.030> map<00:01:27.210> each<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:27.659> like

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
one at one of the map each so like

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.730 
one at one of the map each so like
they'll<00:01:27.960> come<00:01:28.170> at<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.350> from<00:01:28.409> different

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
directions so it's even more of a

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.609 
directions so it's even more of a
