so<00:00:09.840> this<00:00:10.080> is<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:11.630> r2d2<00:00:12.630> getting<00:00:13.290> me<00:00:13.440> a<00:00:13.469> little

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
so this is a r2d2 getting me a little

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.430 
so this is a r2d2 getting me a little
bit<00:00:13.799> heavy<00:00:14.009> here<00:00:14.250> on<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.519> side<00:00:15.080> but<00:00:16.080> still

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
bit heavy here on the side but still

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.990 
bit heavy here on the side but still
working<00:00:17.630> I've<00:00:18.630> geared<00:00:18.990> down<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:20.000> driving

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
working I've geared down the driving

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.990 
working I've geared down the driving
train<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:21.900> maximum<00:00:22.800> that<00:00:22.830> I<00:00:23.189> can<00:00:23.490> which<00:00:23.820> is

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
train to the maximum that I can which is

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:46.549 
train to the maximum that I can which is
one<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.359> five<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:29.240> can<00:00:30.240> flip<00:00:30.480> turn

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:01:02.430 

the<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:52.629> head<00:00:53.079> turns<00:00:53.379> also

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:11.490 

you<00:01:02.859> can<00:01:03.010> do<00:01:03.160> a<00:01:03.190> full<00:01:03.460> 360<00:01:10.259> let's<00:01:11.259> try<00:01:11.440> the

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
you can do a full 360 let's try the

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.810 
you can do a full 360 let's try the
transform<00:01:12.040> now<00:01:12.220> I<00:01:13.890> still<00:01:14.890> need<00:01:15.070> to<00:01:15.190> do<00:01:15.310> it<00:01:15.400> by

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
transform now I still need to do it by

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:24.700 
transform now I still need to do it by
no<00:01:15.880> switching

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.490 

all<00:01:25.710> right<00:01:25.860> driving<00:01:26.850> on<00:01:27.240> two<00:01:27.270> wheels<00:01:27.479> now<00:01:27.900> a

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:47.389 

little<00:01:31.500> bit<00:01:31.619> wobbly<00:01:31.830> but<00:01:46.159> let's<00:01:47.159> try<00:01:47.340> to

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
little bit wobbly but let's try to

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:58.420 
little bit wobbly but let's try to
transform<00:01:47.850> again

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.740 

so<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.549> gearing<00:01:59.820> in<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.090> shoulder<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.540> here

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
so the gearing in the shoulder is here

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.219 
so the gearing in the shoulder is here
work<00:02:00.960> pretty<00:02:01.200> well<00:02:02.330> yep<00:02:03.330> that's<00:02:03.780> pretty<00:02:03.930> cool
