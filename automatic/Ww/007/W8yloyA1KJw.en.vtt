00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
recognized yet but it's most likely one

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.370 
recognized yet but it's most likely one
and<00:00:20.000> I<00:00:21.000> was<00:00:21.270> able<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.510> add<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:21.990> real<00:00:22.140> solar

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
and I was able to add it to real solar

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.439 
and I was able to add it to real solar
system<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:23.010> I<00:00:23.400> sent<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.730> mission<00:00:23.850> there<00:00:24.150> so

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
system and I sent a mission there so

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.240 
system and I sent a mission there so
let's<00:00:24.990> get<00:00:25.140> started<00:00:25.560> there<00:00:26.570> so<00:00:27.570> um<00:00:27.900> as<00:00:28.170> you<00:00:29.099> can

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
let's get started there so um as you can

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.659 
let's get started there so um as you can
see<00:00:29.400> I'm<00:00:29.519> using<00:00:29.699> my<00:00:30.769> hydrogen<00:00:31.769> powered<00:00:32.160> VASIMR

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
see I'm using my hydrogen powered VASIMR

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.310 
see I'm using my hydrogen powered VASIMR
internship<00:00:33.180> again<00:00:33.480> from<00:00:33.690> when<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:33.840> before<00:00:34.290> I

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
internship again from when I before I

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.810 
internship again from when I before I
used<00:00:34.500> realism<00:00:34.920> over<00:00:35.130> all<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.460> because<00:00:35.670> I

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
used realism over all that is because I

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.450 
used realism over all that is because I
have<00:00:36.290> temporarily<00:00:37.290> disabled<00:00:38.040> realism

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
have temporarily disabled realism

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.950 
have temporarily disabled realism
overhaul<00:00:38.820> I<00:00:38.969> will<00:00:39.210> be<00:00:39.300> turning<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.660> back<00:00:39.780> on

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
overhaul I will be turning it back on

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.049 
overhaul I will be turning it back on
soon<00:00:40.260> but<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.129> just<00:00:41.370> wanted<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.670> send<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.910> mission

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
soon but I just wanted to send a mission

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.600 
soon but I just wanted to send a mission
here<00:00:42.420> with<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.840> simple<00:00:43.230> electric<00:00:43.739> engines<00:00:44.129> so

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
here with the simple electric engines so

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.479 
here with the simple electric engines so
this<00:00:44.850> isn't<00:00:45.000> entirely<00:00:45.390> realistic<00:00:46.489> just

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
this isn't entirely realistic just

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.540 
this isn't entirely realistic just
because<00:00:47.910> um<00:00:48.620> these<00:00:49.620> engines<00:00:49.950> provide<00:00:50.309> more

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
because um these engines provide more

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.430 
because um these engines provide more
thrust<00:00:50.820> than<00:00:51.030> they<00:00:51.120> should<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:52.170> didn't

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
thrust than they should and I didn't

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.200 
thrust than they should and I didn't
feel<00:00:52.680> like<00:00:52.800> waiting<00:00:53.010> days<00:00:53.670> if<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.030> were<00:00:54.120> an

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
feel like waiting days if you were an

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.900 
feel like waiting days if you were an
actual<00:00:54.570> mission<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.680> wouldn't<00:00:55.949> be<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.760> big

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
actual mission it wouldn't be that big

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.389 
actual mission it wouldn't be that big
of<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.059> deal<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.390> wait<00:00:57.510> days<00:00:57.690> but<00:00:57.960> anyway<00:00:58.370> so<00:00:59.370> uh

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
of a deal to wait days but anyway so uh

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.029 
of a deal to wait days but anyway so uh
Sedna<00:01:00.030> you'll<00:01:00.600> see<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:00.870> on<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:00.960> screen<00:01:01.170> I'm

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
Sedna you'll see it on the screen I'm

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.340 
Sedna you'll see it on the screen I'm
using<00:01:02.250> space<00:01:02.760> engine<00:01:03.180> textures<00:01:03.660> that's<00:01:04.260> an

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
using space engine textures that's an

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.200 
using space engine textures that's an
awesome<00:01:04.500> simulation<00:01:05.159> by<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.369> way<00:01:05.580> space

if<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.780> first<00:01:19.259> for<00:01:19.619> example<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:19.979> had<00:01:20.130> Sedna<00:01:20.670> said

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
if I first for example I had Sedna said

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.450 
if I first for example I had Sedna said
in<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.630> based<00:01:21.810> off<00:01:21.990> Allu<00:01:22.380> as<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:23.130> template

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
in the based off Allu as the template

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.490 
in the based off Allu as the template
that<00:01:23.670> means<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.509> Europa<00:01:25.049> which<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.350> also

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
that means that the Europa which is also

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.050 
that means that the Europa which is also
based<00:01:25.650> off<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:26.040> guess<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.880> sadness

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
based off of you guess the sadness

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.740 
based off of you guess the sadness
texture<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:27.810> need<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.020> fix<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:29.750> it's

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
texture and I need to fix that so it's

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.670 
texture and I need to fix that so it's
gonna<00:01:30.869> be<00:01:31.020> difficult<00:01:31.049> for<00:01:31.439> me<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.590> hide

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
gonna be difficult for me to hide

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.289 
gonna be difficult for me to hide
planets<00:01:32.009> but<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.520> great<00:01:32.700> thing<00:01:32.909> is<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:33.270> can

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
planets but the great thing is I can

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.030 
planets but the great thing is I can
still<00:01:33.689> add<00:01:33.810> these<00:01:33.960> planets<00:01:34.409> like<00:01:34.590> we<00:01:34.740> can<00:01:34.890> go

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
still add these planets like we can go

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.179 
still add these planets like we can go
to<00:01:35.100> ha<00:01:35.790> Maya<00:01:36.090> Pluto's<00:01:36.780> moons<00:01:37.079> Eris<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.979> snow

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
to ha Maya Pluto's moons Eris to snow

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.390 
to ha Maya Pluto's moons Eris to snow
Mia<00:01:39.140> Series<00:01:40.140> Vesta<00:01:40.590> all<00:01:40.740> these<00:01:40.950> all<00:01:41.220> these

Mia Series Vesta all these all these
places<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.850> now<00:01:42.000> have<00:01:42.150> access<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.659> which<00:01:43.229> is

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
places I now have access to which is

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.660 
places I now have access to which is
amazing<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.610> let's<00:01:44.970> talk<00:01:45.090> about<00:01:45.149> Sedna<00:01:46.670> Sedna

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
amazing so let's talk about Sedna Sedna

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.969 
amazing so let's talk about Sedna Sedna
is<00:01:47.880> again<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.689> most<00:01:49.350> likely<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.710> dwarf<00:01:49.920> planet

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
is again a most likely a dwarf planet

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.039 
is again a most likely a dwarf planet
discovered<00:01:50.909> by<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.390> same<00:01:51.780> guy<00:01:51.990> who

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
discovered by the same guy who

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.209 
discovered by the same guy who
discovered<00:01:53.149> Eris<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.750> largest<00:01:55.200> dwarf<00:01:55.799> planet

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
discovered Eris the largest dwarf planet

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.969 
discovered Eris the largest dwarf planet
it<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:57.390> outside<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.290> Kuiper<00:01:58.500> belt<00:01:58.619> its

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
it is outside the Kuiper belt its

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.749 
it is outside the Kuiper belt its
perihelion<00:02:00.200> is<00:02:01.200> extremely<00:02:02.100> far<00:02:02.280> from<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.549> Sun

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
perihelion is extremely far from the Sun

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.310 
perihelion is extremely far from the Sun
and<00:02:03.000> its<00:02:03.180> orbit<00:02:03.509> is<00:02:03.630> extremely<00:02:04.170> elongated

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
and its orbit is extremely elongated

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.499 
and its orbit is extremely elongated
with<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.740> 10,000<00:02:05.490> over<00:02:05.790> ten<00:02:05.969> thousand<00:02:06.439> year

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
with a 10,000 over ten thousand year

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.809 
with a 10,000 over ten thousand year
orbital<00:02:09.509> year<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.500> year<00:02:11.099> on<00:02:11.220> Sedna<00:02:11.580> is<00:02:11.640> ten

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
orbital year so a year on Sedna is ten

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.270 
orbital year so a year on Sedna is ten
thousand<00:02:12.150> years

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
thousand years

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.520

Sedna<00:02:14.280> is<00:02:14.640> one<00:02:15.150> of<00:02:15.240> them<00:02:15.360> reddest<00:02:15.870> objects<00:02:16.410> in

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
Sedna is one of them reddest objects in

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.010 
Sedna is one of them reddest objects in
the<00:02:16.620> solar<00:02:16.770> system<00:02:17.060> after<00:02:18.060> Mars<00:02:18.270> that's<00:02:18.870> why

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
the solar system after Mars that's why

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.660 
the solar system after Mars that's why
you<00:02:19.110> see<00:02:19.350> so<00:02:19.590> red<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:20.040> obviously<00:02:20.370> we<00:02:20.490> don't

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
you see so red and obviously we don't

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:21.590 
you see so red and obviously we don't
actually<00:02:20.820> know<00:02:21.000> what<00:02:21.030> it<00:02:21.210> looks<00:02:21.420> like

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
actually know what it looks like

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.570 
actually know what it looks like
perfectly<00:02:22.110> but<00:02:22.200> we<00:02:22.260> do<00:02:22.410> of<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.500> color<00:02:22.770> space

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
perfectly but we do of the color space

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.460 
perfectly but we do of the color space
engine<00:02:24.090> out<00:02:24.330> of<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.600> color<00:02:24.780> thankfully<00:02:25.320> and

engine out of the color thankfully and

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.080 
engine out of the color thankfully and
we<00:02:25.770> get<00:02:25.920> this<00:02:26.040> beautiful<00:02:26.430> texture

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.070

intriguing one and it's probably not

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.720 
intriguing one and it's probably not
very<00:02:58.470> likely<00:02:58.860> is<00:02:59.130> that<00:02:59.340> there's<00:02:59.520> another

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
very likely is that there's another

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.570 
very likely is that there's another
planet<00:03:00.209> out<00:03:00.360> there<00:03:00.680> like<00:03:01.680> a<00:03:01.709> rocky<00:03:02.070> planet

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
planet out there like a rocky planet

planet out there like a rocky planet
that<00:03:02.760> couldn't<00:03:03.060> be<00:03:03.120> detected<00:03:03.360> because<00:03:03.720> it's

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
that couldn't be detected because it's

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.170 
that couldn't be detected because it's
not<00:03:04.650> very<00:03:04.680> bright<00:03:05.160> that<00:03:05.790> would<00:03:05.940> be<00:03:06.030> awesome

not very bright that would be awesome

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.530 
not very bright that would be awesome
but<00:03:06.540> there's<00:03:07.320> no<00:03:07.470> proof<00:03:07.680> for<00:03:07.709> that<00:03:07.950> and<00:03:08.540> the

but there's no proof for that and the

but there's no proof for that and the

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
reason that they think that could

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
possibly be the case just maybe it's

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.240 
possibly be the case just maybe it's
because<00:03:15.360> originally<00:03:16.140> they<00:03:16.260> thought<00:03:16.500> well

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
because originally they thought well

perihelion<00:03:20.670> is<00:03:21.030> so<00:03:21.360> so<00:03:21.930> far<00:03:22.140> from<00:03:22.320> the<00:03:22.410> Sun<00:03:22.590> and

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
perihelion is so so far from the Sun and

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.509 
perihelion is so so far from the Sun and
it's<00:03:23.519> a<00:03:23.930> peculiar<00:03:24.930> ops<00:03:25.920> this<00:03:26.070> is<00:03:26.250> so

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
it's a peculiar ops this is so

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.210 
it's a peculiar ops this is so
ridiculously<00:03:27.390> far<00:03:27.660> it's<00:03:28.590> gonna<00:03:28.769> be<00:03:28.950> spending

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
ridiculously far it's gonna be spending

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.640 
ridiculously far it's gonna be spending
the<00:03:29.370> vast<00:03:29.730> majority<00:03:29.850> of<00:03:30.150> its<00:03:30.300> time<00:03:30.510> it's<00:03:31.500> so

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
the vast majority of its time it's so

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.110 
the vast majority of its time it's so

far away that you could not observe it
from<00:03:33.269> Earth<00:03:34.519> so<00:03:35.519> that<00:03:35.670> means<00:03:35.880> that<00:03:36.150> it<00:03:37.140> had<00:03:37.320> to

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
from Earth so that means that it had to

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.810 
from Earth so that means that it had to
be<00:03:37.500> discovered<00:03:37.920> in<00:03:38.010> a<00:03:38.100> short<00:03:38.310> window<00:03:38.610> and<00:03:38.760> if

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
be discovered in a short window and if

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.330 
be discovered in a short window and if
it<00:03:38.940> wasn't<00:03:39.150> then<00:03:39.570> you<00:03:39.660> couldn't<00:03:39.930> see<00:03:40.080> it<00:03:40.340> they

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
it wasn't then you couldn't see it they

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.039 
it wasn't then you couldn't see it they
figured<00:03:41.700> well<00:03:42.000> this<00:03:42.030> is<00:03:42.360> either<00:03:42.570> this<00:03:42.810> either

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
figured well this is either this either

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.780 
figured well this is either this either
means<00:03:43.260> that<00:03:43.380> there's<00:03:43.530> tons<00:03:43.769> of<00:03:43.950> these<00:03:44.160> Sedna

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
means that there's tons of these Sedna

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.310 
means that there's tons of these Sedna
like<00:03:45.090> objects<00:03:45.570> out<00:03:45.690> there<00:03:45.720> and<00:03:46.080> we<00:03:46.140> just

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
like objects out there and we just

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.970 
like objects out there and we just
happen<00:03:46.560> to<00:03:46.620> find<00:03:46.799> one<00:03:46.920> or<00:03:47.750> it<00:03:48.750> was<00:03:48.870> a<00:03:48.900> fluke<00:03:49.230> but

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
happen to find one or it was a fluke but

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.150 
happen to find one or it was a fluke but
then<00:03:50.190> they<00:03:51.180> found<00:03:51.420> another<00:03:51.630> one<00:03:51.900> in<00:03:52.410> 2012

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
then they found another one in 2012

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.979 
then they found another one in 2012
announced<00:03:53.549> in<00:03:53.610> 2014<00:03:54.180> it<00:03:54.510> hasn't<00:03:54.720> been<00:03:54.810> named

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
announced in 2014 it hasn't been named

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.009 
announced in 2014 it hasn't been named
yet<00:03:55.170> it<00:03:55.920> opened<00:03:56.280> a<00:03:56.340> new<00:03:56.459> class<00:03:56.670> of<00:03:57.019> objects

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
yet it opened a new class of objects

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.780 
yet it opened a new class of objects
called<00:03:58.200> said<00:03:58.500> noids<00:03:58.709> because<00:03:59.160> it<00:03:59.340> is<00:03:59.459> has<00:03:59.760> a

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
called said noids because it is has a

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.970 
called said noids because it is has a
similar<00:04:00.209> orbit<00:04:00.510> to<00:04:00.600> send<00:04:00.840> its<00:04:01.440> parent<00:04:01.799> hanging

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
similar orbit to send its parent hanging

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.410 
similar orbit to send its parent hanging
on<00:04:02.070> as<00:04:02.190> farther<00:04:02.400> from<00:04:02.580> the<00:04:02.700> Sun<00:04:02.910> but<00:04:03.090> as<00:04:03.209> far

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
on as farther from the Sun but as far

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.180 
on as farther from the Sun but as far
this<00:04:03.540> point<00:04:03.810> is<00:04:03.930> closer<00:04:04.170> it's<00:04:04.920> a<00:04:05.010> little

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
this point is closer it's a little

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.530 
this point is closer it's a little
different<00:04:05.459> but<00:04:05.519> the<00:04:05.580> inclination<00:04:05.910> is<00:04:06.209> similar

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
different but the inclination is similar

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.800 
different but the inclination is similar
so<00:04:06.769> they<00:04:07.769> figured<00:04:08.160> now<00:04:09.120> it<00:04:09.269> can't<00:04:09.450> be<00:04:09.570> a<00:04:09.600> fluke

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
so they figured now it can't be a fluke

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.870 
so they figured now it can't be a fluke
we<00:04:09.930> found<00:04:10.140> two<00:04:10.320> of<00:04:10.410> them<00:04:10.590> so<00:04:10.890> they<00:04:11.250> they<00:04:11.489> they

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
we found two of them so they they they

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.130 
we found two of them so they they they
there<00:04:12.090> has<00:04:12.209> to<00:04:12.239> be<00:04:12.360> a<00:04:12.420> reason<00:04:12.720> for<00:04:12.840> these<00:04:12.900> being

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
there has to be a reason for these being

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.960 
there has to be a reason for these being
here<00:04:13.410> and<00:04:13.590> again<00:04:14.340> there's<00:04:14.610> multiple

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
here and again there's multiple

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.729 
here and again there's multiple
proposals<00:04:15.239> the<00:04:15.810> most<00:04:15.989> interesting<00:04:16.530> is<00:04:16.620> that

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
proposals the most interesting is that

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:17.960 
proposals the most interesting is that
there<00:04:16.830> could<00:04:16.950> be<00:04:17.010> another<00:04:17.100> planet<00:04:17.430> that<00:04:17.820> would

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
there could be another planet that would

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.500 
there could be another planet that would
be<00:04:18.060> cool<00:04:18.299> but<00:04:18.690> who<00:04:19.169> knows<00:04:19.320> so<00:04:20.310> uh<00:04:20.340> back<00:04:21.060> to<00:04:21.090> KSP

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
be cool but who knows so uh back to KSP

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.900 
be cool but who knows so uh back to KSP
the<00:04:22.080> lander<00:04:22.380> we're<00:04:22.560> using<00:04:22.710> is<00:04:22.950> a<00:04:23.099> lunar<00:04:23.580> mod

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
the lander we're using is a lunar mod

engine<00:04:31.770> and<00:04:31.980> we're<00:04:32.580> landing<00:04:32.910> on<00:04:33.060> the<00:04:33.120> red

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
engine and we're landing on the red

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.999 
engine and we're landing on the red
hills<00:04:33.600> of<00:04:33.930> Sedna

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:37.009 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:39.879 

Sedna<00:04:37.819> is<00:04:38.119> the<00:04:38.569> journey<00:04:38.839> so<00:04:39.139> it<00:04:39.439> only<00:04:39.559> takes<00:04:39.800> a

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
Sedna is the journey so it only takes a

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:41.049 
Sedna is the journey so it only takes a
little<00:04:40.009> bit<00:04:40.129> more<00:04:40.189> Delta<00:04:40.580> B<00:04:40.669> than<00:04:40.819> getting<00:04:41.029> to

00:04:41.049 --> 00:04:41.059 
little bit more Delta B than getting to

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:43.209 
little bit more Delta B than getting to
Pluto<00:04:41.539> which<00:04:42.469> you<00:04:42.589> can<00:04:42.740> see<00:04:42.919> in<00:04:42.979> my<00:04:43.069> other

00:04:43.209 --> 00:04:43.219 
Pluto which you can see in my other

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:47.469 
Pluto which you can see in my other
video<00:04:43.960> but<00:04:44.960> it's<00:04:45.710> because<00:04:46.099> of<00:04:46.129> the<00:04:46.490> Oberth

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:47.479 
video but it's because of the Oberth

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:52.119 
video but it's because of the Oberth
effect<00:04:47.569> but<00:04:49.029> your<00:04:50.409> travel<00:04:51.409> time<00:04:51.439> becomes

00:04:52.119 --> 00:04:52.129 
effect but your travel time becomes

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:54.850 
effect but your travel time becomes
significantly<00:04:52.729> longer<00:04:53.029> and<00:04:53.599> I<00:04:54.199> learned<00:04:54.469> one

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
significantly longer and I learned one

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.189 
significantly longer and I learned one
thing<00:04:54.889> about<00:04:55.099> ksb<00:04:55.729> you<00:04:56.629> can't<00:04:56.839> get<00:04:57.020> higher

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 
thing about ksb you can't get higher

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:01.839 
thing about ksb you can't get higher

of<00:05:47.719> course<00:05:47.899> speed<00:05:48.169> this<00:05:48.289> up<00:05:48.469> and<00:05:48.680> I<00:05:48.800> need<00:05:48.949> to

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:49.039 
of course speed this up and I need to

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:50.019 
of course speed this up and I need to
figure<00:05:49.189> out<00:05:49.279> how<00:05:49.370> to<00:05:49.459> get<00:05:49.580> that<00:05:49.699> if<00:05:49.819> I<00:05:49.909> ever

00:05:50.019 --> 00:05:50.029 
figure out how to get that if I ever

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:51.399 
figure out how to get that if I ever
want<00:05:50.270> to<00:05:50.300> do<00:05:50.419> this<00:05:50.509> in<00:05:50.659> realism<00:05:50.930> overall

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:51.409 
want to do this in realism overall

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:54.309 
want to do this in realism overall
because<00:05:51.620> it<00:05:51.800> required<00:05:52.129> a<00:05:52.959> large<00:05:53.959> amount<00:05:54.259> of

00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:54.319 
because it required a large amount of

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:56.379 
because it required a large amount of
Delta<00:05:54.620> V<00:05:54.649> basically<00:05:55.399> you<00:05:55.610> couldn't<00:05:55.909> do<00:05:56.029> it<00:05:56.180> by

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:56.389 
Delta V basically you couldn't do it by

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:58.779 
Delta V basically you couldn't do it by
burning<00:05:56.959> in<00:05:57.110> the<00:05:57.169> Earth's<00:05:57.319> orbit<00:05:57.499> because<00:05:58.069> it

00:05:58.779 --> 00:05:58.789 
burning in the Earth's orbit because it

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:00.639 
burning in the Earth's orbit because it
would<00:05:59.029> drop<00:05:59.719> the<00:05:59.870> Peary<00:06:00.080> ops<00:06:00.229> below<00:06:00.529> the

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:00.649 
would drop the Peary ops below the

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:02.860 
would drop the Peary ops below the
atmosphere<00:06:01.039> before<00:06:01.370> you<00:06:01.490> could<00:06:01.639> get<00:06:01.819> to<00:06:01.879> Sedna

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
atmosphere before you could get to Sedna

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.329 
atmosphere before you could get to Sedna
and<00:06:03.789> so<00:06:04.789> I<00:06:05.029> had<00:06:05.629> to<00:06:05.659> eject<00:06:06.409> from<00:06:06.800> earth<00:06:07.069> and

00:06:07.329 --> 00:06:07.339 
and so I had to eject from earth and

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:09.790 
and so I had to eject from earth and
then<00:06:07.909> change<00:06:08.599> the<00:06:08.659> inclination<00:06:08.870> and<00:06:09.409> then

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 
then change the inclination and then

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.589 
then change the inclination and then
just<00:06:09.949> do<00:06:10.039> a<00:06:10.069> home<00:06:10.219> and<00:06:10.399> transfer<00:06:10.759> it<00:06:11.479> was

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:11.599 
just do a home and transfer it was

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:14.589 
just do a home and transfer it was
difficult<00:06:11.779> um<00:06:12.649> so<00:06:13.249> lots<00:06:13.459> of<00:06:13.550> Delta<00:06:13.849> V<00:06:13.879> very

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:14.599 
difficult um so lots of Delta V very

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:17.649 
difficult um so lots of Delta V very
remote<00:06:14.870> place<00:06:15.819> if<00:06:16.819> you<00:06:16.969> were<00:06:17.089> to<00:06:17.240> stand<00:06:17.479> here

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:17.659 
remote place if you were to stand here

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:19.540 
remote place if you were to stand here
in<00:06:17.689> real<00:06:17.870> life<00:06:18.110> on<00:06:18.439> the<00:06:18.709> surface<00:06:19.039> of<00:06:19.159> said<00:06:19.370> now

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
in real life on the surface of said now

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:20.589 
in real life on the surface of said now
the<00:06:19.610> Sun<00:06:19.879> would<00:06:20.059> just<00:06:20.209> look<00:06:20.300> like<00:06:20.479> an

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:20.599 
the Sun would just look like an

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:22.059 
the Sun would just look like an
extremely<00:06:20.930> bright<00:06:21.169> star<00:06:21.589> like<00:06:21.830> the<00:06:21.949> other

00:06:22.059 --> 00:06:22.069 
extremely bright star like the other

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:23.439 
extremely bright star like the other
stars<00:06:22.370> in<00:06:22.490> the<00:06:22.550> sky<00:06:22.759> of<00:06:22.969> course<00:06:23.120> it<00:06:23.300> would<00:06:23.419> be

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:23.449 
stars in the sky of course it would be

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:27.100 
stars in the sky of course it would be
very<00:06:24.309> very<00:06:25.309> bright<00:06:25.580> but<00:06:26.149> it<00:06:26.659> wouldn't<00:06:26.959> look

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
very very bright but it wouldn't look

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.540 
very very bright but it wouldn't look
like<00:06:27.169> a<00:06:27.319> disc<00:06:27.620> like<00:06:27.709> we<00:06:27.949> can<00:06:28.099> see<00:06:28.279> it<00:06:28.370> from

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:28.550 
like a disc like we can see it from

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.519 
like a disc like we can see it from
Earth<00:06:28.699> anyway<00:06:29.629> thank<00:06:29.959> you<00:06:29.990> for<00:06:30.050> watching<00:06:30.229> I
