cool<00:00:28.949> as<00:00:29.220> now<00:00:30.090> we<00:00:30.150> take<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.420> look<00:00:30.539> at<00:00:30.630> the

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
cool as now we take a look at the

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.359 
cool as now we take a look at the
toy<00:00:30.869> itself<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.439> can<00:00:31.470> obviously<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:32.189> see

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
toy itself you can obviously you see

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.830 
toy itself you can obviously you see
that<00:00:32.550> doesn't<00:00:32.730> have<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.880> lot<00:00:33.059> of<00:00:33.090> articulation

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
that doesn't have a lot of articulation

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.479 
that doesn't have a lot of articulation
but<00:00:34.079> then<00:00:34.230> again<00:00:34.320> this<00:00:34.620> one<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:34.920> from<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.160> 80s

and<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:35.850> expect<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.360> now<00:00:37.320> his<00:00:37.559> legs<00:00:37.829> can<00:00:37.980> go

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
and you expect that now his legs can go

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.950 
and you expect that now his legs can go
forward<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.820> they<00:00:38.910> can<00:00:39.059> go<00:00:39.149> backwards<00:00:39.480> as

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
forward and they can go backwards as

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.830 
forward and they can go backwards as
well<00:00:40.410> as<00:00:40.500> his<00:00:40.620> head<00:00:40.800> can<00:00:41.040> do<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.460> full<00:00:41.840> 360

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
planning on buying this figure is to

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.260 
planning on buying this figure is to
make<00:01:25.650> sure<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.250> function<00:01:26.490> still<00:01:27.030> works

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
make sure that this function still works

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.359 
make sure that this function still works
a<00:01:27.570> lot<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.170> times<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.590> old<00:01:28.799> Thundercats

this<00:01:29.700> mechanism<00:01:30.090> breaks<00:01:30.450> really<00:01:30.750> easy<00:01:31.049> so

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
this mechanism breaks really easy so

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.899 
this mechanism breaks really easy so
it's<00:01:31.590> important<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.159> ask<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.640> seller

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
it's important that you ask the seller

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.030 
it's important that you ask the seller
before<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.659> actually<00:01:33.810> buy<00:01:34.200> one<00:01:34.500> from<00:01:34.680> them<00:01:34.890> as

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
before you actually buy one from them as

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.429 
before you actually buy one from them as
well<00:01:35.610> as<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.119> legs<00:01:36.390> because<00:01:36.840> this<00:01:36.990> figure<00:01:37.259> is

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
well as the legs because this figure is
