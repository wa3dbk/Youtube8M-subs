00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
close outraged that thing is very good

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.719 
close outraged that thing is very good
it<00:01:52.170> seems<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.680> have<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.829> little<00:01:53.009> more<00:01:53.220> optical

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
it seems to have a little more optical

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.030 
it seems to have a little more optical
zoom<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:54.000> could<00:01:54.240> be<00:01:54.360> wrong<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:55.350> general<00:01:55.740> setup

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
zoom I could be wrong the general setup

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.130 
zoom I could be wrong the general setup
of<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.490> makes<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.180> lot<00:01:57.329> more<00:01:57.390> accurate<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.079> I

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
of it makes it a lot more accurate and I

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.780 
of it makes it a lot more accurate and I
can<00:01:58.290> take<00:01:58.469> out<00:01:58.560> snipers<00:01:59.070> with<00:01:59.189> relative<00:01:59.640> ease

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
can take out snipers with relative ease

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.749 
can take out snipers with relative ease
so<00:02:00.149> if<00:02:00.509> you're<00:02:00.719> in<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.899> mission<00:02:01.259> which<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:01.530> know

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
so if you're in a mission which you know

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.490 
so if you're in a mission which you know
coveted<00:02:02.759> snipers<00:02:03.299> certainly<00:02:04.079> worth<00:02:04.229> putting

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
coveted snipers certainly worth putting

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.120 
coveted snipers certainly worth putting
this<00:02:04.649> on<00:02:04.860> if<00:02:05.070> only<00:02:05.460> for<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:05.880> mission

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
this on if only for that mission

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.219 
this on if only for that mission
