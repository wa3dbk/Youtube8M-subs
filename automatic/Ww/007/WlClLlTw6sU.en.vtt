00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.240
 multi-purpose baskets stay at 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.240
 find out 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.950
 The materials that we need are very 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:30.700
 easy to get as a newspaper 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:34.120
 silicon glue white brush coffee 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:37.360
 soluble and some lace or something that has 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.940
 so we'll leave it let's start 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.180
 making subjects with a newspaper is 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.330
 say we take one end of the newspaper and 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:49.449
 we roll diagonal information to the 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.430
 final and we put some silicone the 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.250
 amount of these churritos that we are going to 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.100
 use will depend on how big 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.250
 we want the extra fehm 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.760
 now we take a little trickle and go to 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.339
 give circular shape putting in some 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.070
 silicone and clear parts at the end of each 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.830
 trickle and let's continue putting 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.890
 more and more when we have the width 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.979
 desired from the base let's start to 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.789
 go up countries with a long list 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.130
 following the same form but now 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:25.219
 upwards 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.610
 for the handle of the basket we are going to 

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:31.250
 need two churritos and this we're going 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.079
 to link as doing a kind of 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.539
 stress 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:39.409
 now we stick to the basket 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:42.229
 silicon and just need to paint it and to 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:45.259
 we're going to put white glue on 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:48.170
 a container with a bit of coffee alone 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:51.530
 let's mix 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.409
 and now to paint when we give the 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.649
 First layer we let it dry for 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:01.070
 give him another one when he's ready 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:04.600
 we can decorate our way already 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:08.560
 I put some lace or ribbon and ready 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.560

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.420
 as confectioners or simply give yourself away 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.090
