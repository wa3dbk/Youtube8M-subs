what<00:02:00.729> helps<00:02:01.060> me<00:02:01.330> to<00:02:01.840> gauge<00:02:02.110> where<00:02:02.680> this<00:02:02.890> fold

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
what helps me to gauge where this fold

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.550 
what helps me to gauge where this fold
is<00:02:03.280> is<00:02:03.580> I<00:02:03.670> keep<00:02:03.880> my<00:02:04.000> finger<00:02:04.330> right<00:02:04.540> here<00:02:04.570> by<00:02:05.500> the

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
is is I keep my finger right here by the

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.429 
is is I keep my finger right here by the
fold<00:02:05.950> the<00:02:06.880> insta<00:02:07.390> hold<00:02:07.840> that's<00:02:08.019> covered<00:02:08.319> up

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:08.439 
fold the insta hold that's covered up

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:10.649 
fold the insta hold that's covered up
and<00:02:08.649> I<00:02:09.129> guide<00:02:09.399> it<00:02:09.580> like<00:02:09.970> that<00:02:10.149> and<00:02:10.360> for<00:02:10.479> some

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:10.659 
and I guide it like that and for some

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:11.759 
and I guide it like that and for some
reason<00:02:10.899> that<00:02:10.929> just<00:02:11.049> helps<00:02:11.379> me<00:02:11.530> I'm<00:02:11.650> not

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
reason that just helps me I'm not

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.130 
reason that just helps me I'm not
entirely<00:02:12.159> sure<00:02:12.340> why<00:02:12.580> but<00:02:12.790> it<00:02:12.879> works<00:02:12.939> so<00:02:13.870> here

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
entirely sure why but it works so here

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.790 
entirely sure why but it works so here
we<00:02:14.260> go<00:02:15.690> I'm<00:02:16.690> getting<00:02:16.959> in<00:02:17.050> there<00:02:17.230> I<00:02:17.260> see<00:02:17.500> that<00:02:17.680> my

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
we go I'm getting in there I see that my

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.170 
we go I'm getting in there I see that my
fold<00:02:18.160> is<00:02:18.670> just<00:02:19.540> barely

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
fold is just barely

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.000 
fold is just barely
next<00:02:20.689> and<00:02:21.170> I'm<00:02:21.319> going<00:02:21.469> to<00:02:21.530> go<00:02:21.620> slowly<00:02:23.920> so<00:02:24.920> that

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
next and I'm going to go slowly so that

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.259 
next and I'm going to go slowly so that
I<00:02:25.040> maintain<00:02:25.609> control<00:02:26.150> at<00:02:26.540> all<00:02:26.599> times<00:02:28.269> move

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
I maintain control at all times move

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.300 
I maintain control at all times move
this<00:02:29.450> needle<00:02:29.750> up<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:30.319> down<00:02:30.469> you<00:02:30.769> can<00:02:30.799> see<00:02:31.099> that

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
this needle up and down you can see that

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.059 
this needle up and down you can see that
it's<00:02:31.430> just<00:02:31.609> barely<00:02:32.090> making<00:02:32.719> the<00:02:32.900> fold<00:02:33.260> I<00:02:33.590> want

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
it's just barely making the fold I want

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:35.830 
it's just barely making the fold I want
it<00:02:34.189> as<00:02:34.310> invisible<00:02:34.879> as<00:02:35.030> I<00:02:35.180> can

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
it as invisible as I can

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.020 
it as invisible as I can
so<00:02:36.709> I'll<00:02:36.859> start<00:02:37.099> up<00:02:37.219> again<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:37.639> just<00:02:37.730> try<00:02:37.969> to

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
so I'll start up again and just try to

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.780 
so I'll start up again and just try to
maintain<00:02:38.269> as<00:02:38.599> much<00:02:38.629> control<00:02:39.170> as<00:02:39.290> you<00:02:39.500> can<00:02:39.790> now

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
maintain as much control as you can now

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.640 
maintain as much control as you can now
if<00:02:40.969> this<00:02:41.180> really<00:02:41.480> isn't<00:02:41.810> working<00:02:42.230> for<00:02:42.260> you<00:02:42.530> if

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
I really recommend using some best press

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.550 
I really recommend using some best press
we<00:03:35.269> sell<00:03:35.479> it<00:03:35.569> on<00:03:35.629> the<00:03:35.689> website<00:03:35.930> comes<00:03:36.409> in<00:03:36.500> a

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
we sell it on the website comes in a

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.619 
we sell it on the website comes in a
bunch<00:03:36.709> of<00:03:36.799> different<00:03:36.859> scents<00:03:37.250> but<00:03:37.970> it<00:03:38.239> works

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629 
bunch of different scents but it works

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:42.250 
bunch of different scents but it works
so<00:03:38.810> well<00:03:39.349> with<00:03:40.569> giving<00:03:41.569> a<00:03:41.659> little<00:03:41.780> bit<00:03:41.989> more

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
so well with giving a little bit more

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.679 
so well with giving a little bit more
stability<00:03:42.979> to<00:03:43.400> knits<00:03:44.000> so<00:03:44.299> they're<00:03:44.419> easier

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:44.689 
stability to knits so they're easier

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:46.030 
stability to knits so they're easier
it's<00:03:44.900> just<00:03:45.079> easier<00:03:45.319> to<00:03:45.349> work<00:03:45.530> with<00:03:45.590> that

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
it's just easier to work with that

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.979 
it's just easier to work with that
really<00:03:46.370> kind<00:03:47.239> of<00:03:47.269> makes<00:03:47.419> the<00:03:47.569> difference<00:03:47.840> for

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
really kind of makes the difference for

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.170 
really kind of makes the difference for
me<00:03:48.109> so<00:03:48.739> I<00:03:48.769> pressed<00:03:49.099> it<00:03:49.220> out<00:03:49.370> I'm<00:03:49.879> going<00:03:50.000> to<00:03:50.060> go

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
me so I pressed it out I'm going to go

guide me I find that bowing this fold is
a<00:05:12.170> little<00:05:12.530> bit<00:05:12.650> helpful<00:05:12.950> but<00:05:13.370> that<00:05:14.060> fall<00:05:14.270> on

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390 
a little bit helpful but that fall on

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.330 
a little bit helpful but that fall on
the<00:05:14.480> outside<00:05:14.840> one<00:05:15.020> really<00:05:15.320> works<00:05:15.470> for<00:05:16.220> me

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
the outside one really works for me

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.950 
the outside one really works for me

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
you can see how that barely Nick's the

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.430 
you can see how that barely Nick's the
fabric<00:05:23.000> and<00:05:23.210> it<00:05:23.330> still<00:05:23.660> maintains<00:05:24.230> the

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
fabric and it still maintains the

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.680

stretch<00:05:24.950> it's<00:05:25.460> not<00:05:25.700> very<00:05:25.970> noticeable

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
stretch it's not very noticeable

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.300 
stretch it's not very noticeable
especially<00:05:26.900> if<00:05:27.650> you<00:05:27.740> have<00:05:27.890> a<00:05:27.920> thread<00:05:28.190> that

really<00:05:28.910> matches<00:05:29.270> the<00:05:29.300> fabric<00:05:29.810> it'll<00:05:30.440> be

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560
