cute and they had this in a hot pink in
white<00:02:57.989> and<00:02:58.019> a<00:02:58.380> black<00:02:58.410> and<00:02:59.069> aqua<00:02:59.819> blue<00:03:00.000> my

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
white and a black and aqua blue my

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.759 
white and a black and aqua blue my
favorite<00:03:00.360> color<00:03:00.599> so<00:03:00.930> of<00:03:00.989> course<00:03:01.230> I<00:03:01.440> pick<00:03:01.620> up

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
favorite color so of course I pick up

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.009 
favorite color so of course I pick up
the<00:03:01.860> aqua<00:03:02.190> blue<00:03:02.489> what<00:03:02.790> about<00:03:02.880> is<00:03:03.180> so<00:03:03.720> adorable

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
the aqua blue what about is so adorable

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.559 
the aqua blue what about is so adorable
and<00:03:04.470> I<00:03:05.250> believe<00:03:05.610> this<00:03:05.760> is<00:03:05.819> like<00:03:05.970> a<00:03:06.120> cover-up

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
and I believe this is like a cover-up

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:07.850 
and I believe this is like a cover-up
for<00:03:06.780> a<00:03:06.840> swim<00:03:07.080> suit<00:03:07.110> or<00:03:07.440> something<00:03:07.560> like<00:03:07.799> that

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
for a swim suit or something like that

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.280 
for a swim suit or something like that
but<00:03:08.190> I'm<00:03:08.430> probably<00:03:08.730> most<00:03:09.480> likely<00:03:09.630> gonna<00:03:09.989> wear

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
but I'm probably most likely gonna wear
