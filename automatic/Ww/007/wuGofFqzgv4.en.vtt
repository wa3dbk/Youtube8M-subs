00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
 not 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.870
 hi to all and nano I hope you 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.879
 are in shape we end up on the 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.139
 fourth episode of striking transfer 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:16.480
 early we will treat a little bit 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:19.330
 the news of rumors of transfer of 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.060
 more wacky to more serious and we 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.050
 will make the connection with fifa 16 the first 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.880
 player wanted to cover is displayed at 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.560
 the screen is radamel falcao the player 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.599
 lent by the monaco asm this year to 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.189
 manchester who did a second year 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.110
 almost a year and a half ago 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.540
 poor since his injury that does not 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.660
 great thing I changed the stats it is 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.830
 from 88 to 85 believe that it is not 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.300
 because we did not play properly 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.760
 decline and a half that we do not know anymore 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.540
 always football already at -4 it's not 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.840
 bad to cash 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.480
 I liked it at chelsea because you have 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.829
 all sources in the description 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.910
 the mourinho who said he did not want 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.739
 let go then what is it 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.879
 possible yes most certainly he said 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.100
 that he wanted to stay in England 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.899
 I do not see him at all tadic match no 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.920
 did not want so they did not pay his 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.800
 gains of 5 million euros which is 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.110
 understands quite monaco laval did 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.550
 no more ways to pay the salary 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.070
 of a player like a falcao 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.630
 so there is chelsea who has positioned himself 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.890
 a laon and divo costa coffee a very 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.780
 very good season for his first year 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.369
 in chelsea there are didier deroeux pointed 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.289
 by tea party always had and remy 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.670
 so they shot this year with 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:20.500
 three very good in attack before the bac 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.179
 is a little bit old but I 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.459
 think it will be quite complicated to 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:27.220
 to turn over between costa waters 

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:29.709
 who is the striker of chelsea loïc remy 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.200
 and falcao if of adventurous he had to 

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:35.140
 assign to the blues in hand that loïc remy 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.340
 who is leaving you chelsea why not 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.599
 my agreement then that by cons I have not 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.010
 oven at all it is I who say this has 

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:40.420
 bled potez 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.520
 if since the player belongs 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.080
 also monaco simon what we see 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.690
 falcao in chelsea 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.250
 why not recover loïc remy who has 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.200
 well played in France the former lyonnais 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.630
 so that's quite possible and 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.550
 why not accept the marseille union 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.840
 and and I allow myself then you go to me 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.790
 say in the comments of these 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.200
 this is a transfer that is all about 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.630
 possible it must be seen 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.560
 must wait you must think 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.090
 in the comments at the level of the 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.800
 card is at transfer level six 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.980
 long it is possible or not at all 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.380
 case 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.810
 falcao will not stay well manchester nor 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.340
 in Monaco and perhaps had the juve who 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.510
 was above and here to have a puree 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.490
 wanted to strengthen their attack what 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.620
 you have had a good season with 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.290
 one still very young and wanted was a 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.540
 which may interest one by falcao but 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.850
 I preferred to position it rather green 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.840
 are as well as the second juventus 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.340
 quarter that appears on the screen you the 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.650
 discover is Kevin Mirallas ales 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.760
 monaco the ace monaco who has a lot of 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.500
 departing players we will treat it 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.510
 maybe in an episode 5 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.190
 I do not know who is very early 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.030
 episode 5 there are a lot of departures 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.950
 announced in Monaco and and line will go there 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.440
 makes a very, very good season for me 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.150
 in everton 36 matches 11 goals 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.250
 there is rayah his compatriot will do 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.510
 carrasco in monaco if the adventurous they 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.160
 remain are both in selection 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.510
 belgium national very good 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.160
 National selection arts Béziers 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.140
 it has a very very nice card thou 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.150
 do one more sweat that our general 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.700
 compared to fifa only one increase 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.440
 a little bit everywhere pulling goes on 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.660
 speed in dribbling and in physics we 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.790
 are 82 general middle right striker 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.080
 right it's a little bit like that it's 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.959
 super player in any case calm khalaf 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.550
 the old and therefore must possible the 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.810
 transfer to monaco you have them 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.519
 resources as I told you 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.950
 previously in in the description on 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.690
 will see we will see if monaco and is active 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.959
 on the transfer market this summer 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.450
 in any case it is a good omen even if 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:28.239
 leave everton will be quite difficult 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.940
 for kevin mirallas the third that you 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:33.790
 the discover his tastes dogan players of 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.560
 bruce and to their accounts that is very 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.720
 powerful but very fragile 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.209
 this poor boy is very fragile then 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.270
 at barca apparently it's very very 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.430
 hot on its map compared to 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.020
 15h passing him a little less 1 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.280
 why for the simple and good reason 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.290
 that he did only 22 games this year 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.090
 he is very very fragile he is in the end 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.400
 contract therefore linked to the authorization to 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.890
 ban during fc barcelona 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.010
 the prohibition of recruitment 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.480
 until January 1st, 2016 if I tell you 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.710
 no nonsense is confirmed would 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.140
 to go into the description made in 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.700
 comments but that's it 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.570
 possible that they sign it and that it 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:11.910
 happens in January of this year 2016 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.380
 it can be a very good rookie after 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.570
 must see if they adapt to the games 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.239
 red or spanish it's a good medium 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.770
 not very very very good 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.959
 recuperator but it's a good leader in 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:24.210
 bonus stiller balloons made little in 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.800
 a smaller scale a little bit like 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.400
 xavi was she was a good player 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.170
 and who goes there to qatar we had it 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.760
 treated it turns episode can we talk about 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.120
 place at psg and finally he left 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.310
 in Qatar 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.640
 so that can be a good one for the 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.930
 replace the truth because makes a season 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.160
 quite complete which has also marked 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.080
 a goal in the champions league final 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.010
 you know the barça wins the final of the 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.110
 World's Championships 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.220
 so that can be interesting for 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.900
 the barça should cost a player like 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.000
 good hogan he took less young on 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.590
 his general on fifa calais is 83 mo 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.820
 sure he updates to more than 82 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.840
 as usual you tell me what 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.460
 you think of the orders in the 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.350
 comments you are born a live little 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.730
 if you liked it and you leave me even 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.740
 your opinion on the next episode 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.030
 what do you want concrete and 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.870
 I will give you my opinion and especially 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.770
 you will not see the weather 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.790
 regulation 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.840
 do you wear friends anyway? 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.400
 I hope this little video you 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.940
 have enjoyed stays cool especially that's the 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.950
 most important 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.130
 I say very quickly carry aviary shots 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.130
 to goal
