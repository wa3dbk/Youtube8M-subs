00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
you a cool little thing that I figured

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.540 
you a cool little thing that I figured
out<00:00:13.730> on<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:15.030> iPod<00:00:15.330> so<00:00:16.070> as<00:00:17.070> you<00:00:17.310> can<00:00:17.400> probably

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
out on the iPod so as you can probably

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.080 
out on the iPod so as you can probably
tell<00:00:17.699> from<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.090> title<00:00:18.270> this<00:00:18.600> is<00:00:18.840> how<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:20.090> make

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
tell from the title this is how to make

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.060 
tell from the title this is how to make
it<00:00:21.689> so<00:00:21.930> that<00:00:22.140> you<00:00:22.260> don't<00:00:22.439> have<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.650> jailbreak

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
it so that you don't have to jailbreak

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.220 
it so that you don't have to jailbreak
your<00:00:23.100> iPod<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:23.939> you'll<00:00:24.390> have<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.660> do<00:00:24.779> download

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
your iPod and you'll have to do download

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.750 
your iPod and you'll have to do download
anything<00:00:26.420> and<00:00:27.420> you<00:00:28.199> can<00:00:28.410> tell<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.340> battery

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
anything and you can tell the battery

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.410 
anything and you can tell the battery
percentage<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.599> your<00:00:31.289> iPod<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:33.030> I

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
percentage of your iPod and this is I

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.600 
percentage of your iPod and this is I
believe<00:00:34.110> this<00:00:34.440> goes<00:00:34.649> for<00:00:34.920> every<00:00:35.340> single<00:00:35.640> iPod

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
believe this goes for every single iPod

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.830 
believe this goes for every single iPod
but<00:00:38.610> there<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:40.520> just<00:00:41.520> follow<00:00:42.360> these<00:00:42.600> steps

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
but there is so just follow these steps

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.959 
but there is so just follow these steps
and<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.559> will<00:00:43.590> have<00:00:44.129> be<00:00:44.399> able<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.640> figure<00:00:44.850> out

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
and you will have be able to figure out

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.580 
and you will have be able to figure out
your<00:00:45.120> brighter<00:00:45.390> percentage<00:00:46.020> because

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
your brighter percentage because

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.430 
your brighter percentage because
sometimes<00:00:46.950> it's<00:00:47.129> hard<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.460> figure<00:00:47.610> what<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.000> is

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
sometimes it's hard to figure what it is

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.200 
sometimes it's hard to figure what it is
just<00:00:49.440> by<00:00:49.620> looking<00:00:49.860> at<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.070> picture<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:53.210> so

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
just by looking at the picture so so
