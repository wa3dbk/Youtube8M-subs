00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
hey guys it's Steve on the Guru - today

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.289 
hey guys it's Steve on the Guru - today
we're<00:00:04.769> going<00:00:04.859> to<00:00:04.979> talk<00:00:05.220> about<00:00:05.459> ready<00:00:05.910> boost

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
we're going to talk about ready boost

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.810 
we're going to talk about ready boost
ready<00:00:07.109> boost<00:00:07.439> has<00:00:07.799> been<00:00:08.040> around<00:00:08.370> since

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
ready boost has been around since

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.199 
ready boost has been around since
Windows<00:00:09.660> Vista<00:00:09.980> and<00:00:10.980> it's<00:00:11.700> one<00:00:11.910> of<00:00:11.940> those

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:12.209 
Windows Vista and it's one of those

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:15.499 
Windows Vista and it's one of those
tools<00:00:12.629> that<00:00:13.289> if<00:00:13.709> you<00:00:14.580> meet<00:00:14.999> a<00:00:15.240> certain

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
tools that if you meet a certain

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.960 
tools that if you meet a certain
condition<00:00:15.959> you<00:00:16.800> can<00:00:17.039> use<00:00:17.279> it<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.609> make<00:00:17.760> your

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
condition you can use it to make your

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.349 
condition you can use it to make your
computer<00:00:18.420> go<00:00:18.720> faster<00:00:19.260> but<00:00:20.250> in<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.580> end<00:00:20.880> it's

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
computer go faster but in the end it's

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.960 
computer go faster but in the end it's
cheaper<00:00:21.810> just<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.260> get<00:00:22.439> RAM<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:23.429> take<00:00:23.640> care<00:00:23.880> of

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
cheaper just to get RAM to take care of

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.560 
cheaper just to get RAM to take care of
the<00:00:24.029> same<00:00:24.269> problem<00:00:24.779> this<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:25.920> about

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
the same problem this is about

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.839 
the same problem this is about
Microsoft's<00:00:27.570> ready<00:00:27.900> boost<00:00:28.259> let's<00:00:29.099> get<00:00:29.490> into<00:00:29.820> a

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
Microsoft's ready boost let's get into a

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.560 
Microsoft's ready boost let's get into a
deeper<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.599> I'll<00:00:30.689> explain<00:00:31.730> well<00:00:32.730> if<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.300> want

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
deeper and I'll explain well if you want

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.130 
deeper and I'll explain well if you want
to<00:00:33.720> improve<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.830> performance<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.730> your<00:00:36.140> Vista

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
to improve the performance of your Vista

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.710 
to improve the performance of your Vista
or<00:00:37.320> Windows<00:00:37.350> 7<00:00:37.770> computer<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:39.360> can<00:00:39.570> use

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:39.720 
or Windows 7 computer you can use

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.960 
or Windows 7 computer you can use
something<00:00:40.080> called<00:00:40.260> ready<00:00:40.800> boost<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.610> I

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
something called ready boost and I

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.730 
something called ready boost and I
haven't<00:00:42.300> checked<00:00:42.570> but<00:00:42.810> I<00:00:42.870> think<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.320> works<00:00:43.500> on

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:43.740 
haven't checked but I think it works on

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.560 
haven't checked but I think it works on
Windows<00:00:44.100> 8<00:00:44.400> -<00:00:45.350> anyway<00:00:46.490> ready<00:00:47.490> boost<00:00:47.880> will<00:00:48.330> add

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
Windows 8 - anyway ready boost will add

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.130 
Windows 8 - anyway ready boost will add
additional<00:00:49.080> memory<00:00:50.180> it's<00:00:51.180> not<00:00:51.450> really<00:00:51.810> like

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
additional memory it's not really like

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.530 
additional memory it's not really like
adding<00:00:52.620> RAM<00:00:52.950> it's<00:00:53.340> more<00:00:53.580> like<00:00:53.760> adding<00:00:54.210> page

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
adding RAM it's more like adding page

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.220 
adding RAM it's more like adding page
memory<00:00:55.310> but<00:00:56.310> you<00:00:56.490> may<00:00:56.670> may<00:00:57.300> be<00:00:57.360> able<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.900> speed

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
memory but you may may be able to speed

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.000 
memory but you may may be able to speed
up<00:00:58.260> your<00:00:58.560> computer<00:00:58.620> by<00:00:59.340> using<00:00:59.670> ready<00:01:00.210> boost

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
up your computer by using ready boost

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.860 
up your computer by using ready boost
but<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.040> wouldn't<00:01:02.400> recommend<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:03.180> if<00:01:03.360> you<00:01:03.630> have

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
but I wouldn't recommend it if you have

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.760 
but I wouldn't recommend it if you have
over<00:01:04.259> 2<00:01:04.979> gig<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.460> ram<00:01:05.489> already<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.560> one

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
over 2 gig of ram already so this is one

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.039 
over 2 gig of ram already so this is one
of<00:01:07.890> those<00:01:08.039> things<00:01:08.399> that<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.909> lot<00:01:09.329> of<00:01:09.600> people

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
of those things that a lot of people

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.889 
of those things that a lot of people
don't<00:01:10.289> you<00:01:10.890> know<00:01:11.009> fall<00:01:11.369> under<00:01:11.789> if<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.630> go<00:01:12.840> to

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:12.899 
don't you know fall under if you go to

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:15.950 
don't you know fall under if you go to
my<00:01:13.310> computer<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.390> right-click<00:01:15.390> my

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
my computer and right-click my

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.950 
my computer and right-click my
properties<00:01:16.679> you<00:01:17.100> can<00:01:17.280> see<00:01:17.609> that<00:01:17.820> my<00:01:18.149> computer

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
properties you can see that my computer

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.149 
properties you can see that my computer
currently<00:01:19.710> has<00:01:19.890> 8<00:01:20.280> gig<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.969> ram<00:01:20.999> on<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:22.649> this

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
currently has 8 gig of ram on it so this

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.179 
currently has 8 gig of ram on it so this
machine<00:01:23.399> would<00:01:23.820> benefit<00:01:24.479> at<00:01:24.600> all<00:01:25.070> but<00:01:26.070> I'm

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
machine would benefit at all but I'm

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.830 
machine would benefit at all but I'm
going<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.399> show<00:01:26.609> you<00:01:26.670> this<00:01:26.939> anyway<00:01:27.509> on<00:01:27.689> this

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
going to show you this anyway on this

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.120 
going to show you this anyway on this
machine<00:01:28.460> so<00:01:29.460> I've<00:01:29.609> got<00:01:29.850> 8<00:01:30.060> gig<00:01:30.479> installed<00:01:31.130> I've

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
machine so I've got 8 gig installed I've

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.719 
machine so I've got 8 gig installed I've
got<00:01:32.579> this<00:01:32.960> micro<00:01:34.100> flash<00:01:35.100> card<00:01:35.520> this<00:01:35.789> is<00:01:35.850> 4<00:01:37.729> this

is 4 gig to Sony and I'm going to put it

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.609 
is 4 gig to Sony and I'm going to put it
in<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:44.130> configure<00:01:44.999> for<00:01:45.420> readyboost<00:01:45.749> so<00:01:46.530> you

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
in and configure for readyboost so you

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.520 
in and configure for readyboost so you
can<00:01:46.770> see<00:01:46.950> how<00:01:47.069> it<00:01:47.219> works<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:48.030> let<00:01:48.420> me<00:01:48.630> do<00:01:49.350> that

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
and this is brand new out of the package

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.690 
and this is brand new out of the package
let's<00:01:55.200> go<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.499> plug<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.889> in

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.480 

okay<00:02:01.700> so<00:02:01.760> I<00:02:01.940> plugged<00:02:02.360> in<00:02:02.570> the<00:02:03.040> device<00:02:04.040> and<00:02:04.400> you

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
okay so I plugged in the device and you

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.740 
okay so I plugged in the device and you
can<00:02:04.790> see<00:02:05.210> that<00:02:05.480> I've<00:02:05.690> got<00:02:05.890> choices<00:02:06.890> here<00:02:07.370> and

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
can see that I've got choices here and

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.840 
can see that I've got choices here and
one<00:02:08.750> of<00:02:08.869> them<00:02:09.050> is<00:02:09.170> speed<00:02:09.470> up<00:02:09.619> my<00:02:09.800> system<00:02:10.310> on<00:02:10.520> the

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
one of them is speed up my system on the

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.310 
one of them is speed up my system on the
very<00:02:11.030> bottom<00:02:11.300> and<00:02:11.690> that's<00:02:11.960> actually

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
very bottom and that's actually

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:19.030 
very bottom and that's actually
readyboost<00:02:13.630> so<00:02:14.630> we<00:02:14.780> can<00:02:14.960> click<00:02:15.140> on<00:02:15.200> that<00:02:18.040> and

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
readyboost so we can click on that and

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.790 
readyboost so we can click on that and
we<00:02:19.550> can<00:02:19.820> dedicate<00:02:20.300> this<00:02:20.930> device<00:02:21.380> to

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
we can dedicate this device to

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.710 
we can dedicate this device to
readyboost<00:02:22.160> if<00:02:22.640> we<00:02:22.790> want<00:02:23.030> to<00:02:23.090> leave<00:02:23.300> it<00:02:23.420> in<00:02:23.540> all

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
readyboost if we want to leave it in all

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.070 
readyboost if we want to leave it in all
the<00:02:23.840> time<00:02:24.110> or<00:02:24.490> we<00:02:25.490> can<00:02:25.760> just<00:02:26.000> use<00:02:26.120> this<00:02:26.570> device

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
the time or we can just use this device

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.700 
the time or we can just use this device
and<00:02:27.500> then<00:02:27.860> it'll<00:02:28.310> be<00:02:28.670> okay<00:02:29.510> to<00:02:29.680> reformat<00:02:30.680> and

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
and then it'll be okay to reformat and

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.400 
and then it'll be okay to reformat and
use<00:02:30.980> it<00:02:31.130> for<00:02:31.310> something<00:02:31.520> else<00:02:31.730> in<00:02:31.940> the<00:02:32.030> future

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
use it for something else in the future

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.320 
use it for something else in the future
so<00:02:33.410> let's<00:02:34.160> go<00:02:34.310> ahead<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:34.520> just<00:02:34.820> click<00:02:35.120> this

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
so let's go ahead and just click this

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.380 
so let's go ahead and just click this
one<00:02:35.390> now<00:02:35.990> you<00:02:36.050> can<00:02:36.410> see<00:02:36.680> that<00:02:36.920> you<00:02:37.100> can<00:02:37.390> adjust

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
one now you can see that you can adjust

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.930 
one now you can see that you can adjust
how<00:02:38.990> much<00:02:40.810> memory<00:02:41.810> this<00:02:42.170> uses<00:02:42.860> and<00:02:43.130> this<00:02:43.730> is<00:02:43.910> a

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
how much memory this uses and this is a

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.970 
how much memory this uses and this is a
four<00:02:44.330> gig<00:02:44.630> and<00:02:44.900> you<00:02:45.020> can<00:02:45.170> see<00:02:45.410> if<00:02:45.560> I<00:02:45.680> pull<00:02:45.950> it

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
four gig and you can see if I pull it

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.280 
four gig and you can see if I pull it
all<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.490> way<00:02:46.670> over<00:02:46.940> I<00:02:47.090> can't<00:02:47.480> even<00:02:47.630> get<00:02:47.930> quite

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
all the way over I can't even get quite

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.910 
all the way over I can't even get quite
four<00:02:48.620> gig<00:02:48.920> that's<00:02:49.730> because<00:02:50.240> some<00:02:51.200> room<00:02:51.709> is

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
four gig that's because some room is

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.740 
four gig that's because some room is
needed<00:02:52.310> for<00:02:52.490> thumbnails<00:02:52.760> and<00:02:53.270> things<00:02:53.510> like

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
needed for thumbnails and things like

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.710 
needed for thumbnails and things like
that<00:02:54.020> but<00:02:54.790> I'm<00:02:55.790> just<00:02:55.850> going<00:02:56.270> to<00:02:56.300> leave<00:02:56.510> it<00:02:56.630> at

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
that but I'm just going to leave it at

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:04.990 
that but I'm just going to leave it at
the<00:02:56.840> max<00:02:57.110> and<00:02:57.470> hit<00:02:57.590> apply<00:02:57.830> and<00:03:01.239> okay<00:03:03.400> my<00:03:04.400> system

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
the max and hit apply and okay my system

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.800 
the max and hit apply and okay my system
is<00:03:05.120> now<00:03:05.390> using<00:03:06.020> that<00:03:06.050> full<00:03:06.560> time<00:03:07.090> or<00:03:08.090> rather

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
is now using that full time or rather

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.130 
is now using that full time or rather
choosing<00:03:09.470> it<00:03:09.590> right<00:03:09.739> now<00:03:09.920> let's<00:03:10.190> hit<00:03:10.370> start<00:03:11.140> my

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
choosing it right now let's hit start my

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:19.270 
choosing it right now let's hit start my
computer<00:03:13.030> right<00:03:14.030> click<00:03:16.269> properties<00:03:18.160> you<00:03:19.160> can

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
computer right click properties you can

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.060 
computer right click properties you can
see<00:03:19.550> that<00:03:19.760> the<00:03:19.910> whole<00:03:20.120> drive<00:03:20.540> is<00:03:20.900> now<00:03:21.140> taken

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
see that the whole drive is now taken

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.240 
see that the whole drive is now taken
and<00:03:22.280> there's<00:03:22.850> only<00:03:23.030> a<00:03:23.209> tiny<00:03:23.570> bit<00:03:23.690> of<00:03:24.250> free

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
and there's only a tiny bit of free

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:31.920 
and there's only a tiny bit of free
space<00:03:25.550> so<00:03:26.800> we're<00:03:27.800> using<00:03:28.480> 3.75<00:03:29.480> gig<00:03:30.459> for<00:03:31.459> the

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
space so we're using 3.75 gig for the

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.100 
space so we're using 3.75 gig for the
virtual<00:03:32.930> Ram<00:03:33.650> if<00:03:33.980> you<00:03:34.100> won't<00:03:34.330> now<00:03:35.330> if<00:03:35.690> you<00:03:35.900> go

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
virtual Ram if you won't now if you go

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.080 
virtual Ram if you won't now if you go
it's<00:03:36.590> not<00:03:36.830> the<00:03:37.010> saint<00:03:37.280> like<00:03:37.459> I<00:03:37.580> said<00:03:37.790> it's<00:03:37.940> not

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
it's not the saint like I said it's not

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.690 
it's not the saint like I said it's not
the<00:03:38.330> same<00:03:38.570> kind<00:03:38.840> of<00:03:39.019> like<00:03:39.470> system<00:03:39.980> Ram<00:03:40.220> if<00:03:40.489> you

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
the same kind of like system Ram if you

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.820 
the same kind of like system Ram if you
go<00:03:40.820> to<00:03:40.880> my<00:03:41.120> computer<00:03:41.690> and<00:03:41.870> you<00:03:42.560> right-click

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
go to my computer and you right-click

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.759 
go to my computer and you right-click
and<00:03:43.489> you<00:03:43.519> look<00:03:44.180> at<00:03:44.360> your<00:03:44.720> your<00:03:45.290> installed

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
and you look at your your installed

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.440 
and you look at your your installed
memory<00:03:46.070> you're<00:03:46.700> not<00:03:46.820> going<00:03:47.030> to<00:03:47.090> see<00:03:47.360> an

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
memory you're not going to see an

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.110 
memory you're not going to see an
increase<00:03:47.900> here<00:03:48.230> because<00:03:48.620> it's<00:03:49.400> not<00:03:49.700> really

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
increase here because it's not really

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.330 
increase here because it's not really
real<00:03:50.420> like<00:03:50.900> I<00:03:51.019> said<00:03:51.260> it's<00:03:51.440> like<00:03:51.620> a<00:03:51.650> page<00:03:52.010> file

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
real like I said it's like a page file

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.729 
real like I said it's like a page file
it<00:03:52.730> takes<00:03:53.769> temporary<00:03:54.769> pages<00:03:55.400> in<00:03:55.670> and<00:03:55.910> out<00:03:56.060> of

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
it takes temporary pages in and out of

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.680 
it takes temporary pages in and out of
the<00:03:57.739> flash<00:03:58.130> drive<00:03:58.550> and<00:03:58.940> that's<00:03:59.269> how<00:03:59.540> it

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
the flash drive and that's how it

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:06.220 
the flash drive and that's how it
releases<00:04:02.680> room<00:04:03.680> on<00:04:03.950> your<00:04:04.190> actual<00:04:04.549> RAM<00:04:05.230> but

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
releases room on your actual RAM but

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.740 
releases room on your actual RAM but
again<00:04:06.560> if<00:04:06.920> you're<00:04:07.400> if<00:04:07.730> you<00:04:07.970> already<00:04:08.120> have<00:04:08.420> over

see how it feels this is you know this

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.840 
see how it feels this is you know this
could<00:04:19.750> be<00:04:19.780> good<00:04:20.170> and<00:04:20.470> it's<00:04:21.370> one<00:04:21.610> of<00:04:21.640> those

could be good and it's one of those

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.150 
could be good and it's one of those
tools<00:04:22.180> that<00:04:22.450> you<00:04:22.540> probably<00:04:23.140> won't<00:04:23.410> use<00:04:23.800> much

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160
