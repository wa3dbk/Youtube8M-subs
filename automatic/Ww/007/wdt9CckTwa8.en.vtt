00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 good afternoon dear viewers and 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.250
 subscribers of our channel with you igor 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.919
 I am an expert on plants today I 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.960
 I will talk about how to multiply and his 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.429
 for this you will need yourself 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:17.880
 speaking and you which we will take 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:19.410
 pruning shears and a good country so 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.230
 the first thing to do is to chop 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.600
 on a tree bearing good my tree 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.279
 cuttings annual cuttings as a rule 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.619
 they are taken from the lower branches of good 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.900
 healthy fruit tree you know 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.540
 what do you take now these cuttings when 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.360
 we cut you need to properly cut that 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.260
 they leave the bottom cut right 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.690
 under the kidney and make the upper cut over 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.059
 a barrel but at such a distance to 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.180
 when the tree dries out so that the bud 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.969
 stayed alive here so here you have ready 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.590
 cutting a few dots here for sure 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.390
 also do with the other cuttings 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.879
 bottom cut right under the kidney here 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.500
 literally a top cut over the kidney 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.390
 so that she can normally 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.890
 function and now take these 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.860
 cuttings and stick their ground but 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.869
 Naturally do not confuse the bottom and top on 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.130
 2 buds 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.530
 at a distance from each other can 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.240
 slightly tilted at this one angle 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.200
 the upper kidney that stayed us on 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.600
 level per ground view 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.220
 you can sprinkle it a little bit like this 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.290
 grind literally a centimeter 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.170
 this will give the opportunity to form a new 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.060
 rootlets here are watered specifically 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.770
 moisten it is not necessary nature will do everything 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.650
 herself here is wet enough raw 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.240
 the land keep in mind if you plant them 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.520
 just like that about half 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.170
 cuttings wither and half we survive 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.090
 three planted one most likely to survive 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.130
 so that you have taken a big part 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.810
 more than half need to do this 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.310
 small improvised greenhouse 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.799
 set and what sets 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.630
 here our cellophane did not touch the cuttings 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.539
 take a piece of cellophane 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.090
 tear off the edges neatly 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.770
 sprinkle with earth 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.750
 here in about three weeks days in 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.180
 20 that is, you should already appear 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.070
 first roots you certainly do not rush them 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.380
 pull out before the fall they have to let 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.259
 good roots but in the fall you can already 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.280
 put on a permanent place is the first 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.840
 way there is a way more productive 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.569
 the fact that it gives enough 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.170
 much overgrown root here please 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.110
 Attention 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.940
 see you went sprout and under it already 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.590
 spine we formed specially 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.360
 dug a sapling to make you clearer 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.250
 of course you donâ€™t have to show you 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.470
 mine it in order to make 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.180
 such an operation you need to take a sharp knife 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.190
 neatly connected with and so that 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:35.549
 left and green stalk and spine 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:37.410
 a piece of retribution like this fact and so 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.880
 it turned out well here we already 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.130
 actually ready sapling 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.470
 we also dig a hole under it 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.940
 small can be shortened by the way back 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.069
 now if we cut this central one 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.590
 spine and plant we will begin 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.269
 the formation of the lobes the night who does not and will 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.989
 wider more powerful root 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.850
 system 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.160
 now slightly digs it up and 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.850
 you can insert the spine again with 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.170
 put a small slope send 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.690
 since the root system is not very yet 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.459
 we have a strong 1. already big enough 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.989
 Of course, here are these extra leaves 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:11.130
 delete delete all don't worry 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.650
 put literally a couple of things 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.359
 up here it will be enough 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.450
 plans to plant a lot of water not 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:19.799
 was aging from 2 simple ways which 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.620
 can be used for breeding and you 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:24.329
 Of course all this to do in a shady place 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.069
 if those naturally there is no supply shield 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.840
 some pull so the moisture here is not 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:30.650
 evaporates so that the sun does not roast ours 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.650
 young main 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.770
 so today he showed two simple 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.300
 ways to multiply this 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.569
 magnificent plant called 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.550
 my this I say goodbye to you look 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.230
 our plot videos even better subscribe 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.650
 on our youtube channel lucky you 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.650
 landings
