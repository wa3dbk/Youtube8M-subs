confidence across that back line the
keeper<00:00:30.199> included

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.569 

this<00:00:37.050> has<00:00:37.199> been<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.410> great<00:00:37.649> start<00:00:38.070> for<00:00:38.129> him<00:00:38.339> has

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.840 
and I think he'll be now setting one or
two<00:00:42.629> targets<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.260> were<00:00:43.379> different<00:00:43.769> ones<00:00:44.670> he
