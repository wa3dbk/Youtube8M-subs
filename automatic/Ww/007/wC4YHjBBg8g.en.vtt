tracks throughout the level i'm going to

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.360 
tracks throughout the level i'm going to
pull<00:03:00.110> that<00:03:00.320> way<00:03:00.530> back<00:03:00.770> a<00:03:00.800> little<00:03:00.980> bit<00:03:01.130> so<00:03:01.280> you

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
pull that way back a little bit so you

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
pull that way back a little bit so you
can<00:03:01.430> kind<00:03:01.640> of<00:03:01.670> see<00:03:01.730> an<00:03:01.910> example<00:03:02.090> of<00:03:02.330> that

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
can kind of see an example of that

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.480 
can kind of see an example of that
basically<00:03:03.230> showing<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:03.680> best<00:03:03.890> place<00:03:04.130> base<00:03:04.340> to

the<00:03:09.890> way<00:03:10.010> around<00:03:10.160> the<00:03:10.340> level<00:03:10.670> kind<00:03:11.360> of<00:03:11.420> keeps

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
the way around the level kind of keeps

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.850 
the way around the level kind of keeps
you<00:03:11.750> from<00:03:12.020> getting<00:03:12.320> stuck<00:03:12.620> on<00:03:12.800> the

you from getting stuck on the

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.320 
you from getting stuck on the
obstruction<00:03:13.370> kind<00:03:14.000> of<00:03:14.060> gives<00:03:14.180> you<00:03:14.240> the

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
obstruction kind of gives you the

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.590 
obstruction kind of gives you the
fastest<00:03:14.750> way<00:03:14.780> from<00:03:14.960> point<00:03:15.380> A<00:03:15.470> to<00:03:15.500> point<00:03:15.620> B<00:03:16.600> so

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
fastest way from point A to point B so

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.660 
fastest way from point A to point B so
use<00:03:18.350> money<00:03:18.650> because<00:03:18.890> people<00:03:19.130> recognize<00:03:19.490> this

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
use money because people recognize this

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.910 
use money because people recognize this
location<00:03:19.820> it's<00:03:20.330> kind<00:03:20.600> of<00:03:20.690> a<00:03:20.750> kind<00:03:21.710> of<00:03:21.740> the

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
location it's kind of a kind of the

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.160 
location it's kind of a kind of the
genesis<00:03:22.640> of<00:03:22.760> firefight<00:03:23.660> when<00:03:23.840> people<00:03:24.080> think

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
genesis of firefight when people think

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
of firefight this location kind of

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.430 
of firefight this location kind of
defines<00:03:28.340> obviously<00:03:28.940> what<00:03:29.090> firefight<00:03:29.510> is<00:03:29.660> so

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
defines obviously what firefight is so
