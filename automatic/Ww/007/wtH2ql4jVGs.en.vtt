00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:27.089
 I have the pleasure to present you the new scanner plustek smart office 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:28.979
 weighs 280 6 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:31.809
 and because mr ultra fast transportable 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:34.980
 who is capable of this year 25 pages per minute in double-sided and you in 

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:37.660
 see what you're doing from europe to excel 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.890
 a pdf format 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.770
 or the multitude of others in a multitude of other formats 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.730
 I propose to demonstrate it to you 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.050
 we started because it is for example this stack of three 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:47.860
 Documents 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.370
 that we wish to be able to modify and that we have thought about 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.700
 so I put the document in my scanner 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.610
 I'd first configure the function of my scanner by no means voice the 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.510
 document that I scans to bordeaux 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.930
 so I can on this channel 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.739
 digitization is celebrating 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.100
 and then I will be able to recover so on wood or on any other software of 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.670
 word processor 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:10.950
 Something 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.960
 openoffice strong no excesses do will accept what I digitize so the 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.460
 character recognition software that comes with the ska 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.930
 nerves 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.980
 modane certain choices of digitization as the choice of the language of the setting 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.420
 in page with this stop that these therapies 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.130
 simply on the island 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.220
 the digitization thus the recognition of characters in front carried out 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.410
 and I will recover so what I scans 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.410
 can then edit 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.260
 either in section or other opens I recover 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.900
 what gesca born exactly and I'm little then simply change it 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.340
 so we also have the possibility 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.770
 2 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.930
 scan documents and send them by axel 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.230
 for example we have for example a table often difficult to 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.620
 recover we are often forced to pull myself together 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.960
 this is amply the famous stuntman 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.160
 you have previously configured functions three musketeers for this 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.639
 times send me what I hope excellent 

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:13.520
 so I select the 3d function 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.899
 and I press on digitized 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:17.899
 so the sca is done 

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:21.159
 the character recognition software like earlier you 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:23.019
 offers some layout options 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:24.779
 I simply press the ranks 

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:28.079
 and so I will recover the contents of my painting 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.079
 on excel 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.609
 so excel file that I can of course modified as with the fission 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.469
 Of course, it is also possible to create files 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:43.290
 pdf 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.390
 so let's imagine that we were supporting the document of this type there that we 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.839
 wish to send to pdf 

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:51.569
 in the same way that we have another document we can park 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.569
 up to 50 pages 

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:58.699
 I select the function kpg previously configured for pdf 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:01.319
 I support and the sca will not be done 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.130
 see here it's an example with a scan of a color document 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.110
 his release is therefore a little bit slower than with black and 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.669
 white but still 

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:11.309
 very powerful 

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:12.719
 the sca is done 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:16.169
 and you will see that I will recover on the screen 

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:18.909
 then once the character recognition software will be 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:19.420
 past 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.780
 I press the ir I will recover on the screen a true copy of my 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.109
 document as it is there 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.419
 and according to a few seconds 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:31.599
 see for software pdf breath 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:34.799
 and I simply get a copy of the descriptive document 

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:40.569
 it does not stop there since 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.379
 we are not obliged not only because it is simply a4 formats 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.249
 take the example of cash receipts 

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:49.329
 classic of a trader 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.319
 we have the possibility 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.529
 two scanned despite its small size and low thickness 

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:56.650
 and can recover 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.650
 so this 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.349
 the jsk is lost pdf see I'll get my receipt I 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.269
 have absolutely not tampered 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.009
 so on the former USSR 

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:13.249
 on good pds 

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:16.819
 it is a scanner so as you said it was 25 pages per 

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:19.909
 minute in double-sided it would rather be a single pass because 

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:21.530
 that he pilot's reading head 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.740
 but each side so when the fed passes it is scanned on both sides 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.139
 in one pass 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.409
 it is a scanner that you will find on our website plustek which 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:33.330
 restores com point 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.449
 you can order it for online 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:38.759
 which is guaranteed two years 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:43.199
 so it's a transportable scanner I measure that 26 centimeters by 12 finally 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:46.900
 it has a nodule at the corner and is supplied with a carrying case 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.379
 which allows you to carry everywhere 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:50.779
 and then the teaser in clientele
