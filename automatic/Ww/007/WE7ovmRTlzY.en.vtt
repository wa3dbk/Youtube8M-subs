00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:15.199
 hello welcome today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:20.539
 how to make this banana gummies 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:20.539
 only using our hook 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:27.650
 so to do it we're going to need 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:30.020
 our little hook with more yellows and 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:35.920
 brown rubber bands and if you do not have commas 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.920
 You can use browns in black 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.380
 Let's go there 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:47.520
 to start we take a yellow rubber 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.520
 and we have to give him 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:56.140
 23 laps to keep you here 4 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.829
 so you have four loops here 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.390
 now we take 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.390
 two yellow rubber bands 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.400
 and we have to pass this 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:16.570
 there toward the center now 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.570
 we pick up on the other side 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:25.830
 we would have our first little hole 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.820
 we have to make six holes as 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.409
 this one now 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.409
 we take another two yellow 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.570
 we passed this to go we would take 2 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.830
 3 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.299
 4 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.120
 well you can pass all with 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.780
 careful one two three four five me 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.780
 one is left 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.890
 that with this one 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.000
 we make the 6 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.450
 now when you have your 6 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.450
 holes 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.599
 you have to 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.390
 take the hook and put in the first 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:26.090
 hollow of all 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.940
 in this here the first one you put the 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.600
 hook 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.600
 class 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.560
 and now we have to do four 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.560
 Matte holes from here 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.060
 you take two and you pass through the center 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.060
 of the first hole 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.909
 I would take one 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.909
 we have to do 4 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.560
 with this would be two 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.420
 and once 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:16.750
 and 4 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:20.650
 very well now I would have to catch two 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:23.140
 brown rubber bands when we already have 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.850
 six on one side and the four on other 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.850
 we take two brown rubber bands 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.450
 and we have to pass everything 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:42.360
 I pick up the other side 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:45.750
 I now take a brown gum more 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.880
 I give it a turn 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.460
 and we would stay here on the finger with double 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.000
 return 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:55.190
 and we have to go through these two for the 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.140
 double turn 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.140
 and now a brown rubber band 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.160
 and this is what we have here 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.240
 with double return and now we have to 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.240
 make a knot 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.390
 that we pass one inside the other and 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.230
 we help 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.230
 we stretch well 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.000
 and now 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.879
 we take and we put our hook 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:36.030
 by any comma I always take two 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.030
 well from the center 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:44.940
 or so a bit crossed does not matter 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:47.750
 and we take a yellow rubber and we had it 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.750
 In the center 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:55.280
 and here we tie a knot again 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.750
 this is so that you do not run out is the 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.750
 so annoying hole in the center 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:05.870
 and now with all this left over 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:09.310
 we put our hook 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.310
 by any place 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.840
 and we are going to stretch it 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.390
 I put it a little bit here 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:26.750
 and now I put it somewhere else to go 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.449
 entangling it 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:33.289
 and that does not look 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:36.220
 and so we will stay our banana 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:41.160
 we give a little bit of shape 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:41.160
 and there is a very cool banana 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.990
 very cool and simple to do 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:56.730
 and this would have been everything so I hope 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.730
 you liked it 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:04.420
