would look like on a phone screen at 320
pixels<00:04:09.489> and<00:04:09.930> then<00:04:10.930> this<00:04:11.079> is<00:04:11.259> what<00:04:11.409> it<00:04:11.500> looks

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
pixels and then this is what it looks

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.379 
pixels and then this is what it looks
like<00:04:11.739> on<00:04:12.039> a<00:04:12.069> desktop<00:04:12.459> so<00:04:12.819> it's<00:04:12.939> pretty<00:04:13.150> amazing

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:13.389 
like on a desktop so it's pretty amazing

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:16.949 
like on a desktop so it's pretty amazing
and<00:04:14.069> yeah<00:04:15.069> bootstrap<00:04:15.789> is<00:04:16.030> just<00:04:16.299> full<00:04:16.509> of<00:04:16.539> this

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
and yeah bootstrap is just full of this

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.560 
and yeah bootstrap is just full of this
responsive<00:04:17.590> functionality<00:04:18.489> so<00:04:19.000> if<00:04:19.090> we<00:04:19.269> take<00:04:19.509> a

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
responsive functionality so if we take a

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.689 
responsive functionality so if we take a
look<00:04:19.840> further<00:04:20.530> down<00:04:20.680> the<00:04:20.919> page<00:04:21.130> you<00:04:21.340> can<00:04:21.459> see

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:21.699 
look further down the page you can see

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:22.860 
look further down the page you can see
that<00:04:21.880> I<00:04:21.909> start<00:04:22.210> talking<00:04:22.360> about<00:04:22.599> the

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
that I start talking about the

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.120 
that I start talking about the
responsive<00:04:23.469> grid

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
responsive grid

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.580 
responsive grid
here<00:04:24.400> in<00:04:24.610> my<00:04:24.850> demo<00:04:25.210> and<00:04:25.450> this<00:04:26.110> is<00:04:26.260> something

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
here in my demo and this is something

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.340 
here in my demo and this is something
I'm<00:04:26.710> going<00:04:26.860> to<00:04:26.950> be<00:04:27.040> explaining<00:04:27.550> a<00:04:27.990> lot<00:04:28.990> more

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
I'm going to be explaining a lot more

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.430 
I'm going to be explaining a lot more
and<00:04:29.680> in<00:04:30.220> a<00:04:30.310> lot<00:04:30.520> more<00:04:30.730> detail<00:04:31.240> later<00:04:31.870> on<00:04:32.080> in<00:04:32.230> the

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
and in a lot more detail later on in the

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.400 
and in a lot more detail later on in the
series<00:04:32.860> but<00:04:33.520> basically<00:04:34.300> bootstrap<00:04:34.990> is<00:04:35.200> made

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
series but basically bootstrap is made

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.380 
series but basically bootstrap is made
out<00:04:35.590> of<00:04:35.710> this<00:04:35.890> thing<00:04:36.130> called<00:04:36.610> the<00:04:36.730> responsive

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 
out of this thing called the responsive

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.560 
out of this thing called the responsive
grid<00:04:37.720> that's<00:04:38.350> like<00:04:38.590> the<00:04:38.830> whole<00:04:39.130> core<00:04:40.090> behind

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
grid that's like the whole core behind

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.090 
grid that's like the whole core behind
bootstrap<00:04:41.430> and<00:04:43.170> bootstrap<00:04:44.170> basically<00:04:44.830> uses

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
bootstrap and bootstrap basically uses

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.650 
bootstrap and bootstrap basically uses
these<00:04:45.250> twelve<00:04:45.610> columns<00:04:45.960> -<00:04:48.330> it<00:04:49.330> basically

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
these twelve columns - it basically

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.450 
these twelve columns - it basically
gives<00:04:50.080> you<00:04:50.230> the<00:04:50.260> option<00:04:50.680> of<00:04:50.830> having<00:04:51.010> twelve

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
gives you the option of having twelve

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.020 
gives you the option of having twelve
columns<00:04:51.900> okay<00:04:52.900> and<00:04:53.110> you<00:04:53.590> can<00:04:53.890> use<00:04:54.400> as<00:04:54.700> many<00:04:54.880> of

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
columns okay and you can use as many of

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.700 
columns okay and you can use as many of
those<00:04:55.210> columns<00:04:55.630> as<00:04:55.750> you<00:04:55.780> want<00:04:56.080> so<00:04:56.290> over<00:04:56.530> here

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
those columns as you want so over here

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.060 
those columns as you want so over here
I'm<00:04:56.920> using<00:04:57.600> four<00:04:58.600> columns<00:04:59.080> and<00:04:59.170> four<00:04:59.680> or

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
I'm using four columns and four or

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.460 
I'm using four columns and four or
twelve<00:05:00.760> divided<00:05:01.060> by<00:05:01.150> four<00:05:01.210> is<00:05:01.450> three<00:05:01.720> so

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
twelve divided by four is three so

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.320 
twelve divided by four is three so
that's<00:05:02.590> why<00:05:02.800> we<00:05:02.950> have<00:05:03.160> these<00:05:03.400> three<00:05:03.910> columns

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
that's why we have these three columns

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.690 
that's why we have these three columns
all<00:05:04.510> three<00:05:04.930> are<00:05:05.170> made<00:05:05.470> in<00:05:05.740> two<00:05:06.400> different

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
all three are made in two different

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.460 
all three are made in two different
colors<00:05:07.240> just<00:05:07.540> so<00:05:07.660> you<00:05:07.750> can<00:05:07.960> see<00:05:08.320> the

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
colors just so you can see the

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.060 
colors just so you can see the
difference<00:05:08.830> and<00:05:10.110> yeah<00:05:11.110> basically<00:05:11.590> these

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
difference and yeah basically these

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.400 
difference and yeah basically these
columns<00:05:12.550> then<00:05:12.760> expand<00:05:13.180> to<00:05:13.330> fit<00:05:13.570> the<00:05:14.140> grid

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
columns then expand to fit the grid

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.040 
columns then expand to fit the grid
which<00:05:14.740> starts<00:05:15.400> here<00:05:15.430> and<00:05:15.790> ends<00:05:16.420> here<00:05:16.540> and<00:05:16.930> we

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
which starts here and ends here and we

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.930 
which starts here and ends here and we
could<00:05:17.170> also<00:05:17.350> make<00:05:17.740> the<00:05:18.070> grid<00:05:18.310> fluid<00:05:18.520> which

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
could also make the grid fluid which

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.480 
could also make the grid fluid which
means<00:05:19.210> that<00:05:19.870> this<00:05:20.860> grid<00:05:21.160> could<00:05:21.340> actually

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
means that this grid could actually

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.930 
means that this grid could actually
start<00:05:21.910> from<00:05:22.590> whether<00:05:23.590> window<00:05:24.400> or<00:05:24.640> the<00:05:24.730> browser

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
start from whether window or the browser

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.150 
start from whether window or the browser
starts<00:05:25.510> on<00:05:25.690> either<00:05:26.170> side<00:05:26.530> so<00:05:26.800> we<00:05:26.860> won't<00:05:27.070> have

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
starts on either side so we won't have

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.000 
starts on either side so we won't have
this<00:05:27.310> big<00:05:27.550> white<00:05:27.760> margin<00:05:28.600> but<00:05:29.320> yeah<00:05:29.890> that's

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
this big white margin but yeah that's

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.770 
this big white margin but yeah that's
just<00:05:30.160> something<00:05:30.460> that<00:05:30.640> I<00:05:30.820> will<00:05:31.060> be<00:05:31.210> explaining

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
just something that I will be explaining

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.130 
just something that I will be explaining
in<00:05:32.440> further<00:05:33.070> detail<00:05:33.460> later<00:05:33.730> on<00:05:33.850> and<00:05:34.210> the<00:05:34.810> next

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:35.140 
in further detail later on and the next

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.270 
in further detail later on and the next
thing<00:05:35.290> you<00:05:35.380> can<00:05:35.530> see<00:05:35.770> is<00:05:35.980> that<00:05:36.130> we<00:05:36.250> can

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
thing you can see is that we can

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.430 
thing you can see is that we can
actually<00:05:36.550> nest<00:05:37.120> the<00:05:37.420> grid<00:05:37.660> so<00:05:37.990> we<00:05:38.020> can<00:05:38.290> have

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 
actually nest the grid so we can have

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.470 
actually nest the grid so we can have
grids<00:05:38.830> inside<00:05:39.460> of<00:05:39.610> grids<00:05:39.880> which<00:05:40.120> is<00:05:40.270> pretty

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:40.480 
grids inside of grids which is pretty

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.400 
grids inside of grids which is pretty
awesome<00:05:40.690> and<00:05:41.820> yeah<00:05:42.820> then<00:05:43.750> we<00:05:43.870> can<00:05:44.020> also<00:05:44.140> take<00:05:44.350> a

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:44.410 
awesome and yeah then we can also take a

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.530 
awesome and yeah then we can also take a
look<00:05:44.560> at<00:05:44.680> responsive<00:05:45.190> tables<00:05:45.700> all<00:05:46.090> of<00:05:46.390> that's

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:46.540 
look at responsive tables all of that's

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.480 
look at responsive tables all of that's
going<00:05:46.750> to<00:05:46.840> be<00:05:46.990> in<00:05:47.260> the<00:05:47.530> tutorial<00:05:48.010> series<00:05:48.160> later

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
going to be in the tutorial series later

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.210 
going to be in the tutorial series later

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020 
and scroll down to that responsive form

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.320 
and scroll down to that responsive form
you<00:06:14.230> can<00:06:14.350> see<00:06:14.500> that<00:06:14.650> now<00:06:14.830> it<00:06:15.760> would<00:06:16.000> take<00:06:16.180> up

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
you can see that now it would take up

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.660 
you can see that now it would take up
the<00:06:16.360> phone<00:06:16.660> screen<00:06:17.080> and<00:06:17.610> the<00:06:18.610> labels<00:06:19.300> and<00:06:19.540> the

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:20.670 
the phone screen and the labels and the

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:22.950 
the phone screen and the labels and the
inputs<00:06:21.670> are<00:06:21.940> actually<00:06:22.390> on<00:06:22.450> two<00:06:22.630> different

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 
inputs are actually on two different

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.710 
inputs are actually on two different
lines<00:06:23.140> whereas<00:06:23.890> on<00:06:24.190> the<00:06:24.850> desktop<00:06:25.390> they<00:06:25.660> were

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:25.720 
lines whereas on the desktop they were

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.980 
lines whereas on the desktop they were
all<00:06:25.960> in<00:06:26.170> one<00:06:26.500> line<00:06:26.710> just<00:06:26.980> like<00:06:27.070> that<00:06:27.160> so<00:06:27.990> you

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:28.990 
all in one line just like that so you

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.600 
all in one line just like that so you
can<00:06:29.020> see<00:06:29.140> that<00:06:29.350> it's<00:06:29.500> a<00:06:29.560> very<00:06:29.770> tidy<00:06:30.280> looking

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:30.610 
can see that it's a very tidy looking

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.480 
can see that it's a very tidy looking
form<00:06:31.120> as<00:06:31.330> well<00:06:31.560> so<00:06:32.560> bootstrap<00:06:33.070> gives<00:06:33.310> that

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.490 
form as well so bootstrap gives that

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.340 
form as well so bootstrap gives that
functionality<00:06:34.330> to<00:06:34.510> us<00:06:34.660> where<00:06:34.870> we<00:06:34.990> just<00:06:35.169> add<00:06:35.320> a

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:35.350 
functionality to us where we just add a

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:36.740 
functionality to us where we just add a
bunch<00:06:35.560> of<00:06:35.710> classes<00:06:36.160> and

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:36.750 
bunch of classes and

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:41.300 
bunch of classes and
boom<00:06:36.900> our<00:06:37.290> forms<00:06:38.100> look<00:06:38.370> nice<00:06:39.180> and<00:06:39.510> tidy<00:06:40.310> okay

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.310 
boom our forms look nice and tidy okay

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:43.790 
boom our forms look nice and tidy okay
and<00:06:41.550> one<00:06:42.540> of<00:06:42.660> the<00:06:42.750> last<00:06:43.020> things<00:06:43.410> I'm<00:06:43.590> going<00:06:43.740> to

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 
and one of the last things I'm going to

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.980 
and one of the last things I'm going to
show<00:06:44.460> you<00:06:44.490> guys<00:06:44.820> is<00:06:45.120> that<00:06:45.180> bootstraps

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:45.990 
show you guys is that bootstraps

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:47.480 
show you guys is that bootstraps
actually<00:06:46.320> got<00:06:46.410> quite<00:06:46.560> a<00:06:46.650> bit<00:06:46.830> of<00:06:46.920> built-in

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:47.490 
actually got quite a bit of built-in

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.540 
actually got quite a bit of built-in
JavaScript<00:06:48.240> functionality<00:06:48.690> as<00:06:49.080> well<00:06:49.430> and<00:06:50.430> it

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:50.550 
JavaScript functionality as well and it

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.640 
JavaScript functionality as well and it
actually<00:06:50.700> makes<00:06:50.970> use<00:06:51.240> of<00:06:51.270> jQuery<00:06:52.020> to<00:06:52.140> do<00:06:52.440> this

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.650 
actually makes use of jQuery to do this

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.710 
actually makes use of jQuery to do this
so<00:06:53.010> we're<00:06:53.190> also<00:06:53.310> going<00:06:53.550> to<00:06:53.610> be<00:06:53.790> doing<00:06:54.240> a<00:06:54.510> little

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 
so we're also going to be doing a little

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.330 
so we're also going to be doing a little
bit<00:06:54.960> of<00:06:55.110> jQuery<00:06:55.500> we're<00:06:55.830> actually<00:06:55.980> just<00:06:56.130> going

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:56.340 
bit of jQuery we're actually just going

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.690 
bit of jQuery we're actually just going
to<00:06:56.400> add<00:06:56.610> the<00:06:57.000> jQuery<00:06:58.160> file<00:06:59.160> that's<00:06:59.430> all<00:06:59.610> we're

00:06:59.690 --> 00:06:59.700 
to add the jQuery file that's all we're

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.300 
to add the jQuery file that's all we're
going<00:06:59.790> to<00:06:59.850> do<00:07:00.000> and<00:07:00.710> bootstrap<00:07:01.710> really<00:07:02.100> takes

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:02.310 
going to do and bootstrap really takes

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:03.170 
going to do and bootstrap really takes
care<00:07:02.550> of<00:07:02.580> the<00:07:02.730> rest

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:03.180 
care of the rest

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.990 
care of the rest
so<00:07:03.810> if<00:07:04.140> I<00:07:04.290> go<00:07:04.530> ahead<00:07:04.650> and<00:07:04.950> I<00:07:05.520> click<00:07:05.580> on<00:07:05.850> this

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000 
so if I go ahead and I click on this

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.600 
so if I go ahead and I click on this
button<00:07:06.720> under<00:07:07.140> modal's<00:07:07.620> you<00:07:08.160> can<00:07:08.310> see<00:07:08.460> that
