00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.910
 hello that such friends as we are in this 

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:07.299
 I'll show you how to spend 

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:11.170
 windows 7 for a usb memory or for a 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:14.980
 pendrive this is in case they have want 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.779
 format a to the act logically there are 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.119
 many acts that do not have unity of 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:24.480
 ziritt or failing that have it 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:26.920
 damaged good first thing or also your cpu 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.920
 ask the disk drive 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.370
 damaged a requirement to do this 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.230
 first they have to have a memory 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:37.570
 obviously 4 gigas 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.340
 a pendrive of 4 gigas or if they have one 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.790
 of 8 gigas is much better 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.680
 s 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.510
 will you have to have 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.610
 be totally clean have to 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.230
 format what they have to format what 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.120
 completely because even when they go 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.190
 to do when they finish doing the 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.350
 procedure everything that is there goes to 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.210
 be 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.350
 previously removed if you do not say 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:05.050
 they format it now a very requisite 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:12.250
 fundamental is this have to have 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:15.909
 windows 7 of 2.434 kb that is to say of 2.32 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.979
 giga why because if you have the 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.890
 operating system this I have here 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:23.159
 above that weighs about 4 gigas not 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.830
 they will be able to pass it for usb memory 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.440
 because because even though this 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:33.250
 operating system weighs 4 gigs 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.890
 exactly the memory does not have 4 gigas 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.490
 As you can see it has 3 points 76 gigas 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:42.130
 then it would not fall on your memory in 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:47.560
 the pendrive have to tell you they have 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:49.570
 this operating system that is 2.38 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.080
 gigabyte can do it comfortably 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.600
 now if you do not have this windows 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.090
 if you do not have this windows that 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.220
 I'm pointing here is what can 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.420
 download I'll leave it in the 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.930
 description the download 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.570
 should last around two hours or two 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:12.040
 hours and a half depends on your internet 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:14.230
 Well the next requirement is this 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.989
 they have to have this program this 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.280
 program is called ultra is for this 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.989
 program is temporary with this program 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.090
 is that we are going to do the procedure 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:25.060
 As you can see, I already have this 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.410
 program and this is going to allow a 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.780
 Once you download the program, 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.730
 appear in this way once 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.319
 you double click on the program at 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.760
 operating system is going to open but that 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.210
 it's not what we want to double click 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.130
 here I mean that 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.390
 once you have downloaded the 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.430
 program if you do not have this 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.890
 I'm also going to leave it to the program 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.310
 description you give them double click 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.310
 here 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.790
 and they give him to evaluate 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:03:00.080
 once the program is opened 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:02.870
 go where it says file and open here we go 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.500
 to locate the program where we have it 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.750
 where it was located if you have it 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.000
 if I keep them in download you what 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.880
 they look for download I have it mobile 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.480
 to a partition that I made from my disk what 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:21.650
 I have on the local disk , you are good 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:25.660
 they will locate the program once a 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.660
 Once they place it they give 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.910
 open and then appear here 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:35.600
 now once you see all this 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:38.390
 here we go where it says auto start and 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.750
 record disk image 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:46.390
 a window will open 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.390
 sorry not here do not give self ranking 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.890
 of body 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.700
 record disk image 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.700
 they give him yes 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.150
 you will open this window 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.860
 and they have to see that he's here where he says 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.010
 usb h 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.930
 has to see that it is there and that its 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.390
 pendrive this selected and you will 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.650
 select by the effect if you can not 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.890
 be that not by the effect you 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:17.850
 you select here ok then just you 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:20.639
 give to record here as you can see notice 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.590
 all the data of the unit will be 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.570
 eliminated as I told them ago 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.389
 closed neighbors the shapes are the same 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.830
 and they're going to lose all their data ok here 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:33.790
 they give him yes 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:36.210
 and it will start to save I will wait 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:42.150
 that is downloaded I'll stop the video 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:42.150
 to wait until it reaches 100 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:52.050
 ok ready as you can see here already loaded 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:54.180
 well to 100% here we can close 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.460
 if we go to a team and look for the 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:02.409
 unit we can see how it is here already in 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:05.150
 insects ready to run and format 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:09.849
 if we want 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:12.189
 dish that does not have a disk drive 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:14.319
 or cpu that has the disk drive 

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:16.899
 damaged good everything I hope you have them 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:20.349
 served there have their image made as 

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:22.139
 you can see it 's pretty easy to do ok 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:24.740
 see you later 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:24.740
 bye
