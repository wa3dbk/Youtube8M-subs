electricity gun it doesn't fully

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.420 
electricity gun it doesn't fully
data<00:02:13.600> it<00:02:13.870> only<00:02:14.020> lessens<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.650> effect<00:02:15.040> of<00:02:15.190> the

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430

gun<00:02:15.670> but<00:02:16.180> it<00:02:16.420> also<00:02:16.630> reduces<00:02:17.230> a<00:02:17.680> euro<00:02:18.400> knock

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
gun but it also reduces a euro knock

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.510 
gun but it also reduces a euro knock
back<00:02:19.210> and<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.900> other<00:02:20.080> enemies<00:02:20.710> it<00:02:21.100> pushes

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
piece of weaponry as you can see right

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.130 
piece of weaponry as you can see right
there<00:02:48.610> it<00:02:48.790> shoots<00:02:49.120> people<00:02:49.390> out<00:02:49.720> of<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:49.959> air

there it shoots people out of the air

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.470 
there it shoots people out of the air
and<00:02:50.410> pretty<00:02:51.310> much<00:02:51.400> negates<00:02:51.940> any<00:02:52.150> type<00:02:52.450> of

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
airspace it's like a gnome that shoots

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.360 
airspace it's like a gnome that shoots
around<00:02:55.180> but<00:02:55.870> it's<00:02:56.050> pretty<00:02:56.200> awesome<00:02:56.470> I<00:02:56.830> like<00:02:57.160> it

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
around but it's pretty awesome I like it

a guy using a jetpack right now the

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.110 
a guy using a jetpack right now the
jetpack<00:03:05.260> is<00:03:05.470> kind<00:03:05.980> of<00:03:06.130> crappy<00:03:06.489> I'm<00:03:06.820> not<00:03:06.970> going

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
jetpack is kind of crappy I'm not going

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.760 
jetpack is kind of crappy I'm not going
to<00:03:07.180> like<00:03:07.360> you<00:03:07.570> know<00:03:07.600> past<00:03:07.930> my<00:03:08.110> judgment<00:03:08.530> I<00:03:08.590> was

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
to like you know past my judgment I was

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.310 
to like you know past my judgment I was
using<00:03:09.040> it<00:03:09.220> for<00:03:09.370> a<00:03:09.430> bit<00:03:09.610> but<00:03:10.120> uh<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.810> liftoff

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
using it for a bit but uh the liftoff

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.140 
using it for a bit but uh the liftoff
for<00:03:11.560> the<00:03:11.620> jetpack<00:03:12.100> seems<00:03:12.430> to<00:03:12.610> be<00:03:12.730> a<00:03:12.760> little<00:03:13.000> bit

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
for the jetpack seems to be a little bit

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.000 
for the jetpack seems to be a little bit
of<00:03:13.450> a<00:03:13.660> little<00:03:13.989> bit<00:03:14.110> slow<00:03:14.470> a<00:03:14.500> little<00:03:14.890> bit

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
of a little bit slow a little bit

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.290 
of a little bit slow a little bit
sluggish<00:03:15.310> so<00:03:15.730> it's<00:03:15.880> not<00:03:16.030> going<00:03:16.120> to<00:03:16.239> be

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
sluggish so it's not going to be

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.759 
sluggish so it's not going to be
something<00:03:16.540> that<00:03:16.780> you're<00:03:17.110> gonna<00:03:17.230> see<00:03:17.440> a<00:03:17.470> lot<00:03:17.560> of

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
something that you're gonna see a lot of

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.580 
something that you're gonna see a lot of
people<00:03:18.130> using<00:03:18.400> but<00:03:19.030> I<00:03:19.299> did<00:03:19.660> see<00:03:19.900> a<00:03:19.930> guy<00:03:20.200> running

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
people using but I did see a guy running

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.050 
people using but I did see a guy running
around<00:03:20.709> with<00:03:20.980> a<00:03:21.010> jetpack<00:03:21.310> in<00:03:21.700> a<00:03:21.760> thunder

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
around with a jetpack in a thunder

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.060 
around with a jetpack in a thunder
dragon<00:03:22.239> that<00:03:23.049> was<00:03:23.350> highly<00:03:23.739> annoying

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
dragon that was highly annoying

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.190 
dragon that was highly annoying
especially<00:03:24.370> since<00:03:25.209> you<00:03:25.299> can't<00:03:25.570> fire<00:03:25.870> while

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
especially since you can't fire while

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.800 
especially since you can't fire while
