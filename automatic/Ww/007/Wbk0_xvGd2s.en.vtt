00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
to be playing it as high as possible so

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.820 
to be playing it as high as possible so
get<00:02:21.220> your<00:02:21.400> full<00:02:21.670> reach<00:02:22.140> into<00:02:23.140> your<00:02:23.260> back<00:02:23.500> there

turn<00:02:24.460> round<00:02:24.670> and<00:02:25.060> and<00:02:26.040> then<00:02:27.040> you're<00:02:27.190> playing

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
turn round and and then you're playing

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.120 
turn round and and then you're playing

dominant leg is coming right the way

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.930 
dominant leg is coming right the way
through<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:35.440> then<00:02:36.220> and<00:02:36.580> then<00:02:36.790> you're

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
through and then and then you're

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.270 
through and then and then you're
recovering<00:02:37.600> to<00:02:38.380> the<00:02:38.500> middle<00:02:38.770> of<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:38.980> court

recovering to the middle of the court

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.030 
recovering to the middle of the court
you're<00:02:40.090> receiving<00:02:40.420> stance<00:02:40.990> let<00:02:41.740> me<00:02:41.830> show<00:02:41.980> you

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
so you're back here you turn round you

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.940 
so you're back here you turn round you
two<00:02:45.400> coiled<00:02:45.910> take<00:02:46.660> it<00:02:46.840> up<00:02:47.020> the<00:02:47.320> weight

players<00:03:03.160> often<00:03:03.340> find<00:03:03.670> this<00:03:03.760> most<00:03:04.180> difficult

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
players often find this most difficult

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.330 
players often find this most difficult
it's<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.680> backhand<00:03:06.370> overhead<00:03:06.670> shot<00:03:08.250> let<00:03:09.250> me

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
it's the backhand overhead shot let me

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.990 
it's the backhand overhead shot let me
talk<00:03:09.490> you<00:03:09.520> through<00:03:09.640> this<00:03:09.970> though<00:03:11.070> okay<00:03:12.070> so<00:03:12.130> you

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
talk you through this though okay so you

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.730 
talk you through this though okay so you
start<00:03:13.240> with<00:03:13.270> a<00:03:13.390> backhand<00:03:13.870> grip<00:03:14.050> which<00:03:14.530> is<00:03:14.560> the

start with a backhand grip which is the
thumb<00:03:15.100> down<00:03:15.690> and<00:03:16.770> you'd<00:03:17.770> start<00:03:18.040> in<00:03:18.220> this

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
thumb down and you'd start in this

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.000 
thumb down and you'd start in this
position<00:03:19.000> so<00:03:19.300> you<00:03:19.360> want<00:03:19.690> to<00:03:19.870> be<00:03:20.110> with<00:03:20.920> the

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
position so you want to be with the

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.290 
position so you want to be with the
right<00:03:21.310> foot<00:03:22.590> back<00:03:23.590> you'll<00:03:24.400> whack<00:03:24.640> it<00:03:24.850> up<00:03:25.000> and

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
right foot back you'll whack it up and

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.870 
right foot back you'll whack it up and
you're<00:03:25.480> sideways<00:03:26.200> onto<00:03:26.530> the<00:03:26.890> net<00:03:27.100> the<00:03:27.430> back

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.910 
has always played on the left-hand side
of<00:03:30.490> the<00:03:30.580> courts<00:03:30.970> you're<00:03:31.210> here<00:03:31.770> so<00:03:32.770> you're

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
of the courts you're here so you're

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.090 
of the courts you're here so you're
sideways<00:03:33.520> onto<00:03:34.300> the<00:03:34.420> court<00:03:34.690> the<00:03:35.530> racket<00:03:35.980> is

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
sideways onto the court the racket is

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.490 
sideways onto the court the racket is
back<00:03:36.370> through<00:03:36.640> a<00:03:36.730> backhand<00:03:37.270> grip<00:03:37.440> up<00:03:38.440> there

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
back through a backhand grip up there

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.840 
back through a backhand grip up there
and<00:03:39.510> you<00:03:40.510> on<00:03:40.750> the<00:03:41.680> dominant<00:03:42.250> foot<00:03:42.490> is<00:03:42.610> at<00:03:42.760> the

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
and you on the dominant foot is at the

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.900 
and you on the dominant foot is at the
back<00:03:43.150> with<00:03:43.450> a<00:03:43.480> knee<00:03:43.750> bent<00:03:44.190> that's<00:03:45.190> a<00:03:45.400> starting

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
back with a knee bent that's a starting

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.750 
back with a knee bent that's a starting
position<00:03:46.410> so<00:03:47.410> the<00:03:47.530> actual<00:03:47.830> execution<00:03:48.400> of<00:03:48.670> the

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
position so the actual execution of the

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.260 
position so the actual execution of the
shot

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
shot

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.390 
shot
you're<00:03:49.690> actually<00:03:49.930> going<00:03:50.290> right<00:03:50.800> up<00:03:51.070> with<00:03:51.340> the

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
you're actually going right up with the

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.210 
you're actually going right up with the
racket<00:03:51.970> really<00:03:52.480> high<00:03:52.720> right<00:03:53.470> up<00:03:53.530> and<00:03:54.070> by

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
racket really high right up and by

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.910 
racket really high right up and by
playing<00:03:54.700> that<00:03:55.090> your<00:03:55.600> arm<00:03:55.840> is<00:03:56.050> turned<00:03:56.440> and

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
playing that your arm is turned and

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.060 
playing that your arm is turned and
you're<00:03:57.010> pivoting<00:03:57.690> back<00:03:58.690> in<00:03:59.080> and<00:03:59.740> what<00:03:59.920> you're

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
you're pivoting back in and what you're

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.890 
you're pivoting back in and what you're
doing<00:04:00.400> is<00:04:00.520> you're<00:04:00.670> transferring<00:04:00.970> the<00:04:01.720> weight

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
doing is you're transferring the weight

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.949 
doing is you're transferring the weight
you<00:04:02.140> learn<00:04:02.290> from<00:04:02.650> your<00:04:02.860> racket<00:04:03.370> foot<00:04:03.930> back<00:04:04.930> on

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
you learn from your racket foot back on

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.350 
you learn from your racket foot back on
and<00:04:05.560> then<00:04:06.040> you're<00:04:06.160> coming<00:04:06.430> back<00:04:06.760> into<00:04:07.060> the

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
and then you're coming back into the

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.680 
and then you're coming back into the
court<00:04:07.630> let<00:04:08.560> me<00:04:08.590> show<00:04:08.830> you<00:04:08.920> this<00:04:09.040> in<00:04:09.220> the<00:04:09.250> full

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
court let me show you this in the full

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.640 
court let me show you this in the full
starting<00:04:10.690> turn<00:04:11.730> it<00:04:12.730> up<00:04:13.030> and<00:04:13.450> then<00:04:14.260> coming<00:04:14.620> back

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
starting turn it up and then coming back

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.699 
starting turn it up and then coming back
there<00:04:15.220> so<00:04:15.880> it's<00:04:16.000> just<00:04:16.060> like<00:04:16.330> that<00:04:16.600> turn<00:04:17.320> and

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
there so it's just like that turn and

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.900 
there so it's just like that turn and
then<00:04:18.700> you're<00:04:18.880> back<00:04:19.650> that's<00:04:20.650> all<00:04:20.950> about<00:04:21.340> timing

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
then you're back that's all about timing

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.100 
then you're back that's all about timing
precision<00:04:22.390> that<00:04:23.380> was<00:04:23.500> the<00:04:23.620> backhand<00:04:24.490> overhead

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
precision that was the backhand overhead

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.850 
precision that was the backhand overhead
shot<00:04:26.700> so<00:04:27.810> very<00:04:28.810> important<00:04:29.320> techniques<00:04:29.710> the

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
shot so very important techniques the

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.830 
shot so very important techniques the
master<00:04:30.430> and<00:04:30.790> probably<00:04:31.120> take<00:04:31.300> a<00:04:31.330> few<00:04:31.420> lessons

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
master and probably take a few lessons

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.210 
master and probably take a few lessons
