hey how's it going guys welcome to a
nine<00:00:02.310> hundred<00:00:02.639> dollar<00:00:02.790> gaming<00:00:03.210> pc<00:00:03.540> build

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
nine hundred dollar gaming pc build

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.090 
nine hundred dollar gaming pc build
actually<00:00:04.529> did<00:00:04.710> a<00:00:04.770> couple<00:00:04.920> of<00:00:05.069> things

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
actually did a couple of things

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.440 
actually did a couple of things
differently<00:00:05.640> in<00:00:05.759> this<00:00:05.879> build<00:00:06.089> actually

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
differently in this build actually

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.960 
differently in this build actually
didn't<00:00:06.750> go<00:00:06.870> with<00:00:07.020> an<00:00:07.140> SSD<00:00:07.560> uh<00:00:08.069> this<00:00:08.730> time

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
didn't go with an SSD uh this time

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.790 
didn't go with an SSD uh this time
around<00:00:09.090> since<00:00:09.540> I<00:00:09.750> want<00:00:09.990> to<00:00:10.139> see<00:00:10.349> where<00:00:10.559> I<00:00:10.620> could

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
around since I want to see where I could

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.290 
around since I want to see where I could
put<00:00:10.920> that<00:00:10.950> hundred<00:00:11.370> dollars<00:00:11.610> elsewhere<00:00:12.090> as

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
put that hundred dollars elsewhere as

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.669 
put that hundred dollars elsewhere as
some<00:00:12.450> people<00:00:12.690> have<00:00:12.809> been<00:00:12.840> commenting<00:00:13.440> and

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
some people have been commenting and

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.799 
some people have been commenting and
asked<00:00:14.370> me<00:00:14.460> to<00:00:14.490> try<00:00:14.730> that<00:00:14.880> out<00:00:14.940> so<00:00:15.210> I<00:00:15.240> did<00:00:15.660> in

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
asked me to try that out so I did in

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.140 
asked me to try that out so I did in
this<00:00:15.960> video<00:00:16.320> so<00:00:16.920> if<00:00:17.190> you<00:00:17.400> guys<00:00:17.580> like<00:00:17.850> it<00:00:17.880> this

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
this video so if you guys like it this

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.120 
this video so if you guys like it this
way<00:00:18.330> tell<00:00:18.630> me<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:18.900> I'll<00:00:18.990> out<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.710> don't<00:00:20.100> think

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
way tell me and I'll out I don't think

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.830 
way tell me and I'll out I don't think
I'll<00:00:20.340> get<00:00:20.490> rid<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.699> SSDs<00:00:21.240> but<00:00:21.449> what<00:00:21.600> I<00:00:21.630> think

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
I'll get rid of SSDs but what I think

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.540 
I'll get rid of SSDs but what I think
I'm<00:00:22.170> gonna<00:00:22.350> start<00:00:22.590> doing<00:00:22.830> is<00:00:22.949> putting<00:00:23.369> an

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
I'm gonna start doing is putting an

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.099 
I'm gonna start doing is putting an
option<00:00:23.850> if<00:00:23.939> you<00:00:24.060> want<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.390> get<00:00:24.510> Nessus<00:00:24.840> tea<00:00:24.990> or

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
option if you want to get Nessus tea or

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.320 
option if you want to get Nessus tea or
something<00:00:25.410> else<00:00:25.800> all<00:00:26.130> entirely<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:26.880> know<00:00:26.970> put

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
something else all entirely you know put

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.880 
something else all entirely you know put
the<00:00:27.449> money<00:00:27.570> elsewhere<00:00:27.900> so<00:00:28.199> yeah<00:00:28.650> let's<00:00:28.800> just

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
the money elsewhere so yeah let's just

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.529 
the money elsewhere so yeah let's just
read<00:00:29.160> this<00:00:29.369> with<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.699> CPU<00:00:30.119> I'm<00:00:30.240> one<00:00:30.359> with<00:00:30.480> the

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
read this with the CPU I'm one with the

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.860 
read this with the CPU I'm one with the

CPU<00:00:42.120> so<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:42.570> like<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.780> sleep<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.230> lot

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
CPU so I like to sleep you a lot

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.529 
CPU so I like to sleep you a lot
actually<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.829> run<00:00:44.100> this<00:00:44.219> on<00:00:44.430> my<00:00:44.730> own<00:00:44.760> build<00:00:45.270> um

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
actually I run this on my own build um

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.600 
actually I run this on my own build um
it's<00:00:46.200> just<00:00:46.530> really<00:00:46.770> fast<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.340> very

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
it's just really fast and very

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.700 
it's just really fast and very
overclockable<00:00:48.510> like<00:00:48.719> insanely<00:00:49.230> easily

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
overclockable like insanely easily

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.560 
overclockable like insanely easily
overclockable<00:00:50.309> because<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.910> intel<00:00:51.210> cpus

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
overclockable because the intel cpus

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.250 
overclockable because the intel cpus
don't<00:00:51.840> run<00:00:51.989> as<00:00:52.170> hot<00:00:52.590> as<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.210> AMD<00:00:54.210> cpu<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:54.899> if

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
don't run as hot as the AMD cpu so if

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.689 
don't run as hot as the AMD cpu so if
you<00:00:55.379> guys<00:00:55.530> pair<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:56.010> up<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.370> say<00:00:56.489> like<00:00:56.670> a

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
you guys pair this up and say like a

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.220 
you guys pair this up and say like a
hyper<00:00:56.969> 212<00:00:57.239> that's<00:00:57.690> actually<00:00:58.050> my

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
hyper 212 that's actually my

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.860 
hyper 212 that's actually my
configuration<00:00:58.649> exactly<00:00:59.489> so<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.910> like<00:01:00.780> the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
configuration exactly so I like the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.569 
configuration exactly so I like the
hyper<00:01:01.020> 212<00:01:01.260> Vlad<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.710> with<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.250> was<00:01:02.460> able

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
hyper 212 Vlad and with that I was able

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.460 
hyper 212 Vlad and with that I was able
to<00:01:02.789> get<00:01:02.940> my<00:01:03.090> cpu<00:01:03.449> up<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.750> four<00:01:04.019> point<00:01:04.290> two

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
to get my cpu up to four point two

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.800 
to get my cpu up to four point two
gigahertz<00:01:04.799> no<00:01:05.159> problem<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:06.240> runs<00:01:06.600> really

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
gigahertz no problem and I runs really

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.539 
gigahertz no problem and I runs really
cool<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.350> guys<00:01:07.560> are<00:01:07.680> gonna<00:01:07.770> like<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.130> cpu

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
cool so you guys are gonna like that cpu

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.130 
cool so you guys are gonna like that cpu
cool<00:01:08.700> or<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.850> lot<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.150> as<00:01:09.360> for<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.720> CPU<00:01:10.080> itself

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
cool or a lot and as for the CPU itself

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.770 
cool or a lot and as for the CPU itself
very<00:01:10.979> fast<00:01:11.340> in<00:01:11.520> games<00:01:11.760> not<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.119> best<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.630> a

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
very fast in games not the best in a

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.539 
very fast in games not the best in a
video<00:01:13.439> editing<00:01:13.799> in<00:01:13.890> live<00:01:14.070> stream<00:01:14.280> but<00:01:14.400> it's

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
video editing in live stream but it's

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.399 
video editing in live stream but it's
still<00:01:14.729> more<00:01:15.210> than<00:01:15.240> sufficient<00:01:15.750> for<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.170> kind

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
still more than sufficient for that kind

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.350 
still more than sufficient for that kind
of<00:01:16.439> stuff<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:17.310> free<00:01:17.549> gaming<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:18.060> guys<00:01:18.210> are

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
of stuff and a free gaming you guys are

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.460 
of stuff and a free gaming you guys are
just<00:01:18.479> gonna<00:01:18.600> be<00:01:18.750> absolutely<00:01:18.869> blown<00:01:19.229> away

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
just gonna be absolutely blown away

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.170 
just gonna be absolutely blown away
because<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.979> really<00:01:20.159> does<00:01:20.400> put<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.700> know<00:01:20.970> like

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
because it really does put you know like

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.060 
because it really does put you know like
most<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.750> its<00:01:21.900> power<00:01:22.110> into<00:01:22.350> those<00:01:22.470> four<00:01:22.740> chords

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
most of its power into those four chords

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.399 
most of its power into those four chords
that<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.280> has<00:01:23.430> unlike<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.270> AMD<00:01:24.720> cpus<00:01:25.229> when

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
that it has unlike the AMD cpus when

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.780
