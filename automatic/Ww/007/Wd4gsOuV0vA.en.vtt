00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:16.849 
so hey guys um today I realized

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:19.960 
so hey guys um today I realized
something<00:00:17.150> on<00:00:17.420> my<00:00:17.570> Acer<00:00:18.050> Iconia<00:00:18.080> a<00:00:18.740> 500<00:00:19.490> tablet

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
something on my Acer Iconia a 500 tablet

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.679 
something on my Acer Iconia a 500 tablet
I<00:00:20.980> realized<00:00:21.980> the<00:00:22.189> microphone<00:00:22.759> is<00:00:23.150> actually

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
I realized the microphone is actually

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.460 
I realized the microphone is actually
inside<00:00:24.230> of<00:00:24.740> the<00:00:25.640> tablet<00:00:26.119> under<00:00:26.689> the<00:00:26.840> glass<00:00:27.020> as

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
inside of the tablet under the glass as

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.830 
inside of the tablet under the glass as
in<00:00:27.710> it's<00:00:27.949> like<00:00:28.460> missing<00:00:28.939> an<00:00:29.060> action<00:00:29.480> it's<00:00:29.660> not

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
in it's like missing an action it's not

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.929 
in it's like missing an action it's not
even<00:00:30.170> outside<00:00:31.070> of<00:00:31.220> the<00:00:31.310> tablet

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
even outside of the tablet

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.079 
even outside of the tablet
therefore<00:00:32.480> the<00:00:33.080> sound<00:00:33.350> quality<00:00:33.949> is<00:00:34.220> just

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:35.089 
therefore the sound quality is just

00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:39.910 
therefore the sound quality is just
terrible<00:00:35.660> so<00:00:37.030> I've<00:00:38.030> read<00:00:38.390> some<00:00:39.019> solutions<00:00:39.710> on

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
terrible so I've read some solutions on

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.290 
terrible so I've read some solutions on
how<00:00:39.949> to<00:00:40.129> make<00:00:40.339> the<00:00:40.489> sound<00:00:40.670> quality<00:00:41.180> a<00:00:41.210> bit

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
how to make the sound quality a bit

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.619 
how to make the sound quality a bit
better<00:00:41.769> I'm<00:00:42.769> speaking<00:00:43.550> directly<00:00:43.940> into<00:00:44.510> the

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
better I'm speaking directly into the

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.510 
better I'm speaking directly into the
side<00:00:44.840> of<00:00:45.050> this<00:00:45.110> tablet<00:00:45.440> and<00:00:45.860> it<00:00:46.039> seems<00:00:46.250> to<00:00:46.430> be

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
side of this tablet and it seems to be

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.440 
side of this tablet and it seems to be
working<00:00:46.670> okay

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
working okay

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.569 
working okay
but<00:00:48.079> I<00:00:48.320> don't<00:00:48.559> think<00:00:48.770> I<00:00:48.890> can<00:00:49.070> do<00:00:49.190> this<00:00:49.340> for

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
but I don't think I can do this for

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.959 
but I don't think I can do this for
videos<00:00:49.940> because<00:00:50.300> it<00:00:50.420> makes<00:00:50.600> no<00:00:50.719> sense<00:00:51.969> some

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
videos because it makes no sense some

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.290 
videos because it makes no sense some

microphone that will plug into your
headphone<00:01:11.840> jack<00:01:12.100> now<00:01:13.100> I've<00:01:13.280> read<00:01:13.550> comments<00:01:14.149> on

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
that that say it's still and

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.810 
that that say it's still and
there's<00:01:18.830> nothing<00:01:19.250> you<00:01:19.280> can<00:01:19.400> do<00:01:19.610> with<00:01:19.729> this

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
there's nothing you can do with this

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.050 
there's nothing you can do with this
tablet<00:01:20.119> they<00:01:20.869> say<00:01:21.080> just<00:01:21.350> turn<00:01:21.590> it<00:01:21.740> in<00:01:21.860> and<00:01:22.159> get

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
tablet they say just turn it in and get

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.480 
tablet they say just turn it in and get
a<00:01:23.090> newer<00:01:23.479> version<00:01:23.780> but<00:01:24.770> I<00:01:24.799> cannot<00:01:25.250> do<00:01:25.460> that

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
a newer version but I cannot do that

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.649 
a newer version but I cannot do that
because<00:01:25.880> mine<00:01:26.509> is<00:01:26.720> scratched<00:01:27.170> and<00:01:27.560> damaged

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
because mine is scratched and damaged

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:34.060 
because mine is scratched and damaged
they<00:01:29.659> wouldn't<00:01:30.049> accept<00:01:30.110> it<00:01:30.909> so<00:01:32.200> if<00:01:33.200> you<00:01:33.409> have<00:01:33.439> a

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
they wouldn't accept it so if you have a

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.819 
they wouldn't accept it so if you have a
better<00:01:34.970> tablet<00:01:35.360> better<00:01:36.020> shape<00:01:36.320> than<00:01:36.530> mine
