00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:10.659
 in this letter 

00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:14.059
 so we had a deficit of places so that allows beautiful 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.059
 parts of this country for now the transport of travelers 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:19.650
 we lose a point by a point b 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.650
 it's going to be pretty simple you're a fan 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.439
 so 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:26.730
 first of all we can talk about her 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.069

 gourcuff 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.230
 we used two authors when we will arrive with leverage 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.480
 so on the typology 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.139
 a camera we are not ashamed 

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:49.500
 clear

 so the digital 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.960
 and that's the only purpose of this action is vital that they can transfer 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.300
 Your message

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.620
 tompkins 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.500
 we simply activate a lever 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.620
 and the magic takes place 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.620
 she transmits and there we see the film picks up 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.910

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:15.209
 so congratulations jazz on two filled with 

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:18.029
 it's perfect 

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:19.599

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.209
 multiply the faculties 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.569
 without having to make prostrate taken the head 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.869
 access by less generous 

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:42.859
 There you go 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:44.849
 and therefore to predict 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.590
 according to constant training - he was doing primary storage demonstrates 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.269
 that he is what he lived 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:51.359
 whatever

 reversible joanda for dancing would not transmit much more than a letter 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.569
 a few hours earlier than she needed him 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:52.510
 and in terms of the ramp 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.339
