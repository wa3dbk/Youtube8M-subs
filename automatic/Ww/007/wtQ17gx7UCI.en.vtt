the public that he's a vampire and most

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.179 
the public that he's a vampire and most
in<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.259> general<00:01:43.649> public

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
in the general public

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
um take this as a gimmick like they just

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.249 
um take this as a gimmick like they just
think<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.790> it's<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.270> gimmick<00:01:48.540> for<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.960> band

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
think that it's a gimmick for the band

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.649 
think that it's a gimmick for the band
but<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.740> course<00:01:49.979> that<00:01:50.549> is<00:01:50.790> actually<00:01:51.299> serious

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
but of course that is actually serious

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.859 
but of course that is actually serious
about<00:01:52.259> this<00:01:52.530> because<00:01:53.119> Lestat<00:01:54.119> actually<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:54.840> a

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
about this because Lestat actually is a

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.709 
about this because Lestat actually is a
vampire<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.979> Lestat<00:01:56.850> pretty<00:01:57.210> much<00:01:57.390> knows

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
vampire and Lestat pretty much knows

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.840 
vampire and Lestat pretty much knows
that<00:01:58.110> mortals<00:01:58.680> aren't<00:01:59.189> actually<00:01:59.670> gonna

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
that mortals aren't actually gonna

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.999 
that mortals aren't actually gonna
believe<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.240> he's<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.659> vampire<00:02:01.229> they're<00:02:01.680> just

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
believe that he's a vampire they're just

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.980 
believe that he's a vampire they're just
gonna<00:02:02.159> generally<00:02:02.790> think<00:02:03.090> it's<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.390> gimmick<00:02:03.630> for

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
gonna generally think it's a gimmick for

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.679 
gonna generally think it's a gimmick for
the<00:02:04.049> band<00:02:04.320> but<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:05.280> real<00:02:05.490> reason<00:02:05.790> Lestat<00:02:06.479> is

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
the band but the real reason Lestat is

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.499 
the band but the real reason Lestat is
doing<00:02:07.140> this<00:02:07.290> is<00:02:07.590> because<00:02:07.819> basically<00:02:08.819> it's<00:02:09.360> a

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
doing this is because basically it's a

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.070 
doing this is because basically it's a
rule<00:02:09.750> among<00:02:10.200> vampires<00:02:10.979> that<00:02:11.009> they're<00:02:11.400> not

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
rule among vampires that they're not

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.500
