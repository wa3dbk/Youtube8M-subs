00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
heavier yeah okay that's very very raise

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.359 
heavier yeah okay that's very very raise
it<00:01:43.650> resistant<00:01:44.070> as<00:01:44.159> well

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
it resistant as well

it resistant as well
yeah<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:44.790> yeah<00:01:45.060> okay<00:01:45.869> alright<00:01:46.080> well

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.520 
snapper snapper okay well again fishing
soft<00:01:51.390> plastic<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.810> snap<00:01:51.990> it's<00:01:52.200> very<00:01:52.350> popular

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
soft plastic to snap it's very popular

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.060 
soft plastic to snap it's very popular
right<00:01:52.770> now

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
right now

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.800 
right now
it's<00:01:53.369> not<00:01:53.580> braid<00:01:53.850> well<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.450> can<00:01:54.570> use<00:01:54.689> the

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
it's not braid well you can use the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.719 
it's not braid well you can use the
performance<00:01:55.080> use<00:01:55.409> again<00:01:55.740> but<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.220> matrix<00:01:56.549> pro

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
performance use again but the matrix pro

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.670 
performance use again but the matrix pro
is<00:01:56.790> probably<00:01:57.119> more<00:01:57.299> suited<00:01:57.540> because<00:01:58.020> it's<00:01:58.590> a

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
is probably more suited because it's a

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.770 
is probably more suited because it's a
slightly<00:01:59.040> heavier<00:01:59.430> braid<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.180> generally

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
slightly heavier braid and generally

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.660 
slightly heavier braid and generally
when<00:02:00.930> fishing<00:02:01.200> snapper<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.799> in<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:02.070> deep<00:02:02.520> of

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
when fishing snapper you in a deep of

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.499 
when fishing snapper you in a deep of
water<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:03.090> brim

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
water the brim

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.770 
water the brim
yep<00:02:03.720> and<00:02:04.070> it's<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.369> bit<00:02:05.520> more<00:02:05.670> supple<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:06.180> feels

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
yep and it's a bit more supple it feels

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.389 
yep and it's a bit more supple it feels
like<00:02:06.960> it's<00:02:07.110> halfway<00:02:07.320> between<00:02:07.680> your<00:02:08.129> sort<00:02:08.340> of

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
like it's halfway between your sort of

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.880 
like it's halfway between your sort of
north<00:02:08.670> normal<00:02:09.209> so<00:02:09.329> softer<00:02:09.840> brush<00:02:10.049> and<00:02:10.739> the

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
north normal so softer brush and the

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.619 
north normal so softer brush and the
fuse<00:02:11.189> yeah<00:02:11.459> that's<00:02:11.700> right<00:02:11.849> it's<00:02:12.269> a<00:02:12.329> mid-range

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
fuse yeah that's right it's a mid-range

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.230 
fuse yeah that's right it's a mid-range
braid

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
braid

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.840 
braid
it's<00:02:13.780> not<00:02:13.960> incredibly<00:02:14.800> subtle<00:02:15.190> for<00:02:15.490> sort<00:02:15.760> of

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
it's not incredibly subtle for sort of

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.640 
it's not incredibly subtle for sort of
trolling<00:02:16.090> bottom<00:02:16.570> bashing<00:02:16.870> it<00:02:16.990> it's<00:02:17.500> not

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
trolling bottom bashing it it's not

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.680 
trolling bottom bashing it it's not
incredibly<00:02:17.950> stiff<00:02:18.430> forecasting<00:02:19.030> it's<00:02:19.540> in

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
incredibly stiff forecasting it's in

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.630 
incredibly stiff forecasting it's in
between<00:02:20.050> okay<00:02:20.770> so<00:02:20.830> before<00:02:21.100> we<00:02:21.250> go<00:02:21.400> any<00:02:21.520> further

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
between okay so before we go any further

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.280 
between okay so before we go any further
let<00:02:21.850> me<00:02:21.940> ask<00:02:22.060> you<00:02:22.150> this<00:02:22.240> what<00:02:22.750> is<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:23.110> major

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
let me ask you this what is the major

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.810 
let me ask you this what is the major
advantage<00:02:23.440> and<00:02:23.980> fishing<00:02:24.250> with<00:02:24.340> braid<00:02:24.640> as

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
advantage and fishing with braid as

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.700 
advantage and fishing with braid as
opposed<00:02:25.090> to<00:02:25.180> mono<00:02:25.390> low<00:02:26.080> stretch<00:02:26.410> and

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
opposed to mono low stretch and

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:27.810 
opposed to mono low stretch and
increased<00:02:27.070> sensitivity

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
increased sensitivity

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.280 
increased sensitivity
yeah<00:02:28.000> you<00:02:28.060> can<00:02:28.300> really<00:02:28.600> feel<00:02:28.750> that<00:02:28.810> you<00:02:29.140> can

yeah you can really feel that you can
feel<00:02:29.470> that<00:02:29.500> touches<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.040> bytes<00:02:30.250> and<00:02:30.670> you<00:02:30.730> can

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
feel that touches the bytes and you can

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.000 
feel that touches the bytes and you can
strike<00:02:31.120> yeah<00:02:31.690> you<00:02:32.110> get<00:02:32.410> that<00:02:32.470> big<00:02:32.680> bow<00:02:32.830> in<00:02:32.860> your

mind either when it's coming through the

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.270 
mind either when it's coming through the
water<00:02:34.420> okay<00:02:35.140> that's<00:02:35.350> cool<00:02:35.500> now<00:02:35.740> the<00:02:35.800> last<00:02:36.100> one

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
water okay that's cool now the last one

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.940 
water okay that's cool now the last one
and<00:02:36.640> we<00:02:37.420> all<00:02:37.600> love<00:02:37.990> fishing<00:02:38.350> for<00:02:38.530> barramundi

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
and we all love fishing for barramundi

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.310 
and we all love fishing for barramundi
in<00:02:39.130> this<00:02:39.250> country<00:02:39.580> a<00:02:39.610> gang-up<00:02:40.030> what<00:02:40.870> do<00:02:41.260> you

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
in this country a gang-up what do you

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.100 
in this country a gang-up what do you
what<00:02:41.470> he<00:02:41.530> suggests<00:02:41.950> well<00:02:42.940> barramundi<00:02:43.750> again

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
what he suggests well barramundi again

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.810 
what he suggests well barramundi again
is<00:02:44.230> a<00:02:44.260> casting<00:02:44.710> controlling<00:02:45.130> application

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
is a casting controlling application

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.000 
is a casting controlling application
absolutely<00:02:46.450> you're<00:02:47.230> looking<00:02:47.530> at<00:02:47.650> these<00:02:47.770> two

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
absolutely you're looking at these two

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.710 
absolutely you're looking at these two
again<00:02:48.220> but<00:02:48.460> there<00:02:48.940> is<00:02:49.060> a<00:02:49.090> braid<00:02:49.540> that

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
again but there is a braid that

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.200 
again but there is a braid that
Suffolk's<00:02:50.320> have<00:02:50.440> released<00:02:51.000> specifically<00:02:52.000> for

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
Suffolk's have released specifically for

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.170 
Suffolk's have released specifically for
this<00:02:52.330> sort<00:02:52.570> of<00:02:53.160> application<00:02:54.160> I<00:02:54.220> guess<00:02:54.400> it's

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
this sort of application I guess it's

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.880 
this sort of application I guess it's
the<00:02:55.390> performance<00:02:56.050> stretch<00:02:56.320> it's<00:02:56.530> in<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.710> same

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
the performance stretch it's in the same

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.010 
the performance stretch it's in the same
range<00:02:57.160> as<00:02:57.310> the<00:02:57.430> performance<00:02:57.880> fuse<00:02:58.150> but<00:02:58.300> this

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
range as the performance fuse but this

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.950 
range as the performance fuse but this
is<00:02:59.170> a<00:02:59.200> braid<00:02:59.470> that's<00:02:59.710> been<00:03:00.600> manufactured<00:03:01.600> with

is a braid that's been manufactured with

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.020 
is a braid that's been manufactured with
the<00:03:01.990> use<00:03:02.230> of<00:03:02.260> dynamic<00:03:02.560> fibers<00:03:03.280> and<00:03:03.460> Dacron

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
the use of dynamic fibers and Dacron

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.120 
the use of dynamic fibers and Dacron
okay<00:03:04.600> okay<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:04.990> deccan<00:03:05.350> incorporated<00:03:05.980> into

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
okay okay the deccan incorporated into

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.600 
okay okay the deccan incorporated into
this<00:03:06.370> product<00:03:06.760> gives<00:03:07.210> you<00:03:07.300> a<00:03:07.360> 6%<00:03:07.900> stretch

this product gives you a 6% stretch

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.460 
this product gives you a 6% stretch
unlike<00:03:09.610> most<00:03:09.850> braids<00:03:10.180> which<00:03:10.360> is<00:03:10.510> near<00:03:11.170> zero

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
unlike most braids which is near zero

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.960 
unlike most braids which is near zero
okay<00:03:11.830> okay<00:03:12.070> but<00:03:12.130> it's<00:03:12.370> not<00:03:12.430> a<00:03:12.550> monofilament

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
okay okay but it's not a monofilament

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.970 
okay okay but it's not a monofilament
you<00:03:13.270> still<00:03:13.480> retain<00:03:13.630> the<00:03:13.870> same<00:03:14.050> sensitivity

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
you still retain the same sensitivity

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.970 
you still retain the same sensitivity

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
called performance stretch performance

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.020 
called performance stretch performance
strip<00:03:20.110> of<00:03:20.320> suffix<00:03:20.650> as<00:03:20.800> well<00:03:20.950> yeah<00:03:21.370> so<00:03:21.400> what<00:03:21.880> the

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
strip of suffix as well yeah so what the

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.150 
strip of suffix as well yeah so what the
increase<00:03:22.420> stretch<00:03:22.810> does<00:03:23.050> is<00:03:23.290> with<00:03:23.710> a<00:03:23.740> big<00:03:23.950> fish

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
increase stretch does is with a big fish

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.340 
increase stretch does is with a big fish
like<00:03:24.190> barramundi<00:03:24.670> given<00:03:25.000> notorious<00:03:25.420> smashing

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
like barramundi given notorious smashing

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.530 
like barramundi given notorious smashing
and<00:03:26.470> crashing<00:03:26.950> lovers<00:03:27.310> and<00:03:27.550> it<00:03:28.120> gives<00:03:28.360> you<00:03:28.480> a

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
and crashing lovers and it gives you a

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.060 
and crashing lovers and it gives you a
little<00:03:28.690> bit<00:03:28.930> of<00:03:28.960> you<00:03:29.500> know<00:03:29.530> a<00:03:29.620> little<00:03:29.890> bit<00:03:29.980> of

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
little bit of you know a little bit of

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.640 
little bit of you know a little bit of
give<00:03:30.340> on<00:03:30.580> the<00:03:30.910> take<00:03:31.150> so<00:03:31.630> you<00:03:32.230> know<00:03:32.320> come<00:03:32.620> and

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
give on the take so you know come and

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.260 
give on the take so you know come and
think<00:03:32.920> about<00:03:33.130> Monday<00:03:33.430> is<00:03:33.490> pulling<00:03:33.880> hooks<00:03:34.090> and

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
think about Monday is pulling hooks and

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.460 
think about Monday is pulling hooks and
perhaps<00:03:34.510> some<00:03:34.780> of<00:03:34.840> the<00:03:34.930> things<00:03:35.080> like<00:03:35.140> that<00:03:35.380> is

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
perhaps some of the things like that is

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.080 
perhaps some of the things like that is
really<00:03:35.770> really<00:03:35.980> straight<00:03:36.460> adjuster<00:03:36.850> given

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
really really straight adjuster given

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.970 
really really straight adjuster given
that<00:03:37.240> yeah<00:03:37.660> but<00:03:37.930> you<00:03:38.020> still<00:03:38.080> you<00:03:38.470> still<00:03:38.500> got

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
that yeah but you still you still got

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.920 
that yeah but you still you still got
you<00:03:39.400> still<00:03:39.610> retain<00:03:39.730> all<00:03:40.090> the<00:03:40.120> sensitivity

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
you still retain all the sensitivity

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.320 
you still retain all the sensitivity
that<00:03:41.050> you<00:03:41.110> need<00:03:41.350> so<00:03:41.530> all<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:41.740> features<00:03:42.040> of

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
that you need so all the features of

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.330 
that you need so all the features of
braid<00:03:43.330> with<00:03:44.200> a<00:03:44.230> little<00:03:44.590> added<00:03:44.860> advantage<00:03:45.220> of<00:03:45.280> a

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
braid with a little added advantage of a

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.530 
braid with a little added advantage of a
little<00:03:45.520> bit<00:03:45.610> of<00:03:45.670> stretch<00:03:45.880> as<00:03:46.030> well<00:03:46.060> that's

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
little bit of stretch as well that's

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.760 
little bit of stretch as well that's
right<00:03:46.750> really<00:03:47.050> really<00:03:47.410> good<00:03:47.560> for<00:03:47.710> the

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
right really really good for the

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.620 
right really really good for the
beginner<00:03:47.890> I<00:03:48.340> guess<00:03:48.880> if<00:03:49.000> anyone<00:03:49.270> just<00:03:49.420> goes<00:03:49.540> to

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
beginner I guess if anyone just goes to

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.210 
beginner I guess if anyone just goes to
the<00:03:49.810> retailer<00:03:50.170> they<00:03:50.320> can<00:03:50.470> simply<00:03:50.800> just<00:03:50.950> ask

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
the retailer they can simply just ask

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.100 
the retailer they can simply just ask
them<00:03:51.550> what's<00:03:52.090> the<00:03:52.300> best<00:03:52.450> way<00:03:52.570> to<00:03:52.600> go<00:03:52.810> but<00:03:53.020> that

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
them what's the best way to go but that

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.570 
them what's the best way to go but that
certainly<00:03:53.500> should<00:03:53.650> some<00:03:53.830> light<00:03:54.010> on<00:03:54.160> it<00:03:54.220> for<00:03:54.430> me

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
certainly should some light on it for me

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:55.890 
certainly should some light on it for me
and<00:03:54.760> I'm<00:03:54.820> sure<00:03:54.850> some<00:03:55.240> of<00:03:55.330> our<00:03:55.420> viewers<00:03:55.510> as<00:03:55.870> well

talk to you about there's this whole
thing<00:03:59.440> about<00:03:59.560> fish<00:03:59.920> the<00:04:00.190> system<00:04:00.640> with<00:04:00.820> suffix

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.240 
thing about fish the system with suffix

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.490 
thing about fish the system with suffix
yeah<00:04:01.600> what's<00:04:01.810> that<00:04:01.870> about<00:04:02.140> I<00:04:02.200> mean<00:04:02.350> there's

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
yeah what's that about I mean there's

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.130 
yeah what's that about I mean there's
there's<00:04:02.830> different<00:04:02.950> things<00:04:03.250> out<00:04:03.490> there's

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
there's different things out there's

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.120 
there's different things out there's
fluorocarbons<00:04:05.140> and<00:04:05.260> Manos<00:04:05.530> that<00:04:05.680> we<00:04:05.770> use<00:04:05.950> for

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
fluorocarbons and Manos that we use for

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.890 
fluorocarbons and Manos that we use for
leader<00:04:06.430> what's<00:04:06.640> this<00:04:06.790> system<00:04:07.180> are<00:04:07.840> you

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
leader what's this system are you

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.780 
leader what's this system are you
talking<00:04:08.200> about<00:04:08.440> okay<00:04:08.860> well<00:04:09.040> the<00:04:09.340> system<00:04:09.700> that

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
talking about okay well the system that

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.420 
talking about okay well the system that
suffix<00:04:10.270> have<00:04:10.390> developed<00:04:10.960> is<00:04:11.140> a<00:04:11.200> it<00:04:11.800> pretty

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
suffix have developed is a it pretty

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.780 
suffix have developed is a it pretty
much<00:04:12.580> comprises<00:04:13.210> of<00:04:13.240> a<00:04:13.510> set<00:04:14.320> of<00:04:14.790> instructions

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
much comprises of a set of instructions

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.000 
much comprises of a set of instructions
and<00:04:15.970> just<00:04:16.030> methods<00:04:16.600> best<00:04:17.020> best<00:04:17.590> suited<00:04:17.980> to

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
and just methods best best suited to

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.150 
and just methods best best suited to
fishing<00:04:18.370> they're<00:04:18.549> their<00:04:18.910> lines<00:04:19.299> okay<00:04:19.780> so<00:04:20.160> for

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
fishing they're their lines okay so for

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.860 
fishing they're their lines okay so for
every<00:04:21.489> braid<00:04:22.060> that<00:04:22.210> they<00:04:22.330> make<00:04:22.540> there<00:04:22.750> is<00:04:22.840> a

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
every braid that they make there is a

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.020 
every braid that they make there is a
mono<00:04:23.320> or<00:04:23.590> a<00:04:23.620> leader<00:04:23.890> or<00:04:24.250> a<00:04:24.490> fluorocarbon

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
mono or a leader or a fluorocarbon

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.050 
mono or a leader or a fluorocarbon
that's<00:04:25.510> suited<00:04:25.810> to

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
that's suited to

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.670 
that's suited to
so<00:04:26.300> it's<00:04:26.420> actually<00:04:26.510> made<00:04:26.870> yeah<00:04:27.260> for<00:04:27.560> that

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
so it's actually made yeah for that

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.140 
so it's actually made yeah for that
there's<00:04:28.070> one<00:04:28.220> thing<00:04:28.250> I<00:04:28.460> find<00:04:28.700> sometimes<00:04:28.880> when

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
there's one thing I find sometimes when

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.510 
there's one thing I find sometimes when
we<00:04:29.240> travel<00:04:29.600> and<00:04:29.690> I<00:04:29.750> don't<00:04:29.870> bring<00:04:30.400> you<00:04:31.400> know<00:04:31.490> a

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
we travel and I don't bring you know a

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.100 
we travel and I don't bring you know a
leader<00:04:31.790> material<00:04:31.970> with<00:04:32.389> me<00:04:32.600> and<00:04:32.840> I'm<00:04:32.930> using

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
leader material with me and I'm using

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.990 
leader material with me and I'm using
braids<00:04:33.470> sometimes<00:04:34.250> the<00:04:34.400> guide<00:04:34.550> will<00:04:34.760> give<00:04:34.790> me

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
braids sometimes the guide will give me

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000 
braids sometimes the guide will give me
their<00:04:35.180> mono<00:04:35.750> and<00:04:35.990> I'll<00:04:36.110> tie<00:04:36.440> the<00:04:36.500> the<00:04:36.830> leader

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
their mono and I'll tie the the leader

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.980 
their mono and I'll tie the the leader
to<00:04:37.220> the<00:04:37.310> mono<00:04:37.490> sorry<00:04:38.330> the<00:04:38.450> leader<00:04:38.630> to<00:04:38.870> the

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
to the mono sorry the leader to the

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.110 
to the mono sorry the leader to the
braid<00:04:39.260> and<00:04:39.530> the<00:04:40.280> braid<00:04:40.460> will<00:04:40.639> cut<00:04:40.850> straight

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
braid and the braid will cut straight

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.030 
braid and the braid will cut straight
through<00:04:41.510> that<00:04:41.720> mono<00:04:42.169> obviously<00:04:42.650> that<00:04:42.830> money

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
through that mono obviously that money

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.650 
through that mono obviously that money
doesn't<00:04:43.430> suit<00:04:43.610> that<00:04:43.760> right<00:04:44.030> that's<00:04:44.300> right<00:04:44.480> so

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
doesn't suit that right that's right so

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.120 
doesn't suit that right that's right so
the<00:04:44.870> system<00:04:45.260> the<00:04:45.350> suffix<00:04:45.680> system<00:04:45.980> actually

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
the system the suffix system actually

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.040 
the system the suffix system actually
rules<00:04:46.910> that<00:04:47.060> sort<00:04:47.240> of<00:04:47.270> stuff<00:04:47.450> out<00:04:47.630> and<00:04:47.900> it's

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
rules that sort of stuff out and it's

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.230 
rules that sort of stuff out and it's
matched<00:04:48.350> perfectly<00:04:48.680> the<00:04:49.610> braid<00:04:49.850> is<00:04:50.030> matched

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
matched perfectly the braid is matched

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.430 
matched perfectly the braid is matched
perfectly<00:04:50.330> to<00:04:50.870> the<00:04:51.020> leader<00:04:51.200> that<00:04:51.260> you're

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
perfectly to the leader that you're

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.300 
perfectly to the leader that you're
using<00:04:51.620> that's<00:04:51.860> correct

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
using that's correct

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.270 
using that's correct
so<00:04:53.240> that's<00:04:53.419> the<00:04:53.570> suffix<00:04:54.020> system<00:04:54.560> yeah<00:04:54.770> now<00:04:55.130> one

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
so that's the suffix system yeah now one

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.440 
so that's the suffix system yeah now one
last<00:04:55.490> thing<00:04:55.550> I<00:04:55.639> want<00:04:55.760> to<00:04:55.790> ask<00:04:55.880> you<00:04:56.060> about<00:04:56.120> and<00:04:56.419> a

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
last thing I want to ask you about and a

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:57.970 
last thing I want to ask you about and a
lot<00:04:56.570> of<00:04:56.600> fishermen<00:04:56.840> ask<00:04:57.139> me<00:04:57.290> about<00:04:57.560> it<00:04:57.680> as<00:04:57.800> well

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
lot of fishermen ask me about it as well

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.210 
lot of fishermen ask me about it as well
is<00:04:59.140> fluorocarbon<00:05:00.140> what's<00:05:00.440> the<00:05:00.680> big<00:05:00.860> deal

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
is fluorocarbon what's the big deal

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.640 
is fluorocarbon what's the big deal
about<00:05:01.550> this<00:05:01.850> fluorocarbon<00:05:02.810> I<00:05:02.870> mean<00:05:03.020> it's<00:05:03.500> been

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
about this fluorocarbon I mean it's been

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.740 
about this fluorocarbon I mean it's been
around<00:05:03.800> for<00:05:03.980> a<00:05:04.010> while<00:05:04.070> all<00:05:04.430> I<00:05:04.490> know<00:05:04.730> is<00:05:05.120> it<00:05:05.720> just

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
around for a while all I know is it just

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.630 
around for a while all I know is it just
looks<00:05:05.960> like<00:05:06.080> normal<00:05:06.440> fishing<00:05:06.650> monoline<00:05:07.220> to<00:05:07.520> me

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:07.640 
looks like normal fishing monoline to me

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.980 
looks like normal fishing monoline to me
and<00:05:07.880> it's<00:05:08.360> expensive

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
and it's expensive

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.570 
and it's expensive
that's<00:05:09.140> why<00:05:09.500> is<00:05:09.560> it<00:05:09.830> what's<00:05:10.250> so<00:05:10.370> good<00:05:10.520> about

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
that's why is it what's so good about

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.430 
that's why is it what's so good about
okay<00:05:10.910> well<00:05:11.090> the<00:05:11.300> thing<00:05:11.510> with<00:05:11.630> fluorocarbon<00:05:12.140> is

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
okay well the thing with fluorocarbon is

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.700 
okay well the thing with fluorocarbon is
that<00:05:12.620> it<00:05:12.770> you<00:05:13.640> know<00:05:13.669> it's<00:05:14.330> a<00:05:14.480> sinking<00:05:14.930> later<00:05:15.440> I

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
that it you know it's a sinking later I

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.170 
that it you know it's a sinking later I
mean<00:05:15.919> it<00:05:16.040> sinks<00:05:16.310> up<00:05:16.430> to<00:05:16.550> four<00:05:16.790> times<00:05:17.000> as<00:05:17.150> fast

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
mean it sinks up to four times as fast

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.390 
mean it sinks up to four times as fast
as<00:05:17.570> your<00:05:17.660> monofilament<00:05:18.020> okay<00:05:18.560> but<00:05:19.010> the

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
as your monofilament okay but the

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.520 
as your monofilament okay but the
biggest<00:05:19.940> point<00:05:20.450> with<00:05:20.690> fluorocarbon<00:05:21.110> is<00:05:21.380> that

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
biggest point with fluorocarbon is that

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.740 
biggest point with fluorocarbon is that
it's<00:05:21.680> it's<00:05:22.010> pretty<00:05:22.610> much<00:05:22.700> 100%<00:05:23.120> invisible

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
it's it's pretty much 100% invisible

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.510 
it's it's pretty much 100% invisible
underwater<00:05:24.139> -<00:05:24.320> right<00:05:24.530> so<00:05:25.040> it's<00:05:25.190> really<00:05:25.310> good

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
underwater - right so it's really good

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.100 
underwater - right so it's really good
for<00:05:25.550> a<00:05:25.700> finicky<00:05:25.970> fish<00:05:26.240> or<00:05:26.510> something<00:05:26.960> that's

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
for a finicky fish or something that's

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.659 
for a finicky fish or something that's
just<00:05:27.260> not<00:05:27.410> taking<00:05:27.680> about<00:05:27.770> it<00:05:27.979> can<00:05:28.280> quite<00:05:28.520> often

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
just not taking about it can quite often

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:31.330 
just not taking about it can quite often
turn<00:05:28.940> about<00:05:29.180> on<00:05:29.710> Cooley<00:05:30.710> because<00:05:30.919> I<00:05:30.979> can't<00:05:31.190> see

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
turn about on Cooley because I can't see

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.730 
turn about on Cooley because I can't see
that<00:05:31.490> well<00:05:31.790> yep<00:05:32.090> well<00:05:33.020> that's<00:05:33.290> a<00:05:33.470> pretty<00:05:33.650> big

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
that well yep well that's a pretty big

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.310 
that well yep well that's a pretty big

as well well my dad had shed some light

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.320 
as well well my dad had shed some light
annoyingly<00:05:39.290> on<00:05:39.650> the<00:05:40.070> suffix<00:05:40.370> range<00:05:40.910> but

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
annoyingly on the suffix range but

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.570 
annoyingly on the suffix range but
certainly<00:05:41.630> on<00:05:41.780> what<00:05:42.080> to<00:05:42.229> choose<00:05:42.470> when<00:05:43.070> going

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
certainly on what to choose when going

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.029 
certainly on what to choose when going
