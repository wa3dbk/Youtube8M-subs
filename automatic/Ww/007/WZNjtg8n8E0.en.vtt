 chocolate pudding that's that 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.590
 simplest recipe and buttercream 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.670
 to make you mixa and 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.300
 then you have to just stop the mother 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.300
 beat a little bit foamy 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.420
 in between, try it for a while 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.240
 would say you have to taste that 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.230
 is with a bit of sugar still a 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.040
 should be a little darker one more 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.040
 a bit sale probably true 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:50.020
 Buttercream chocolate is done 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.630
 vanilla also slammed again 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:59.330
 vanilleschote always only half 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:02:00.590
 already scratching out the two 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.500
 Cancers are now totally exhausted 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.790
 In any case it will be the forest 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.250
 tuesday cake 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.890
 of course we build a heart for that 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.650
 I have this one clicks on here 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.600
 I've got it off the Vienna floor 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.760
 measured then cut out and then yes 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:21.940
 the pie down now I cut 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.940
 just me 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:39.510
 hertz is ready then 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:41.720
 once cut off one more lid 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.720
 layer 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:55.220
 ballet buttercream buttercream everyone 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.830
 you do not have to scare the ground 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.350
 if now have this on the sides 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:04.820
 out of the picture because we'll do it again 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:09.170
 then just make it nice in the 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:18.550
 On the bottom you can see the vanilla 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:18.550
 buttercream then comes the lid on it 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.820
 if that is not so straight is 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.060
 not so bad main thing maxime 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.980
 in the heart so no personal 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.030
 trick such a chicken or Schleser 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:42.350
 called just at the pie schedule so 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:47.300
 then just completely around the 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:50.650
 pie rum rum the same 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.650
 Again, really nice on the floor 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.940
 one takes one again such a palette and 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.280
 then quashes the over the 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.500
 simply add excess butter cream in the 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:07.940
 At the middle of the day, a professional 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:10.010
 Wipe off so so so that it was now 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.670
 first I put it briefly cold and 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.290
 then I'll tell you the muddy ground 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:18.530
 yes to make the mark why in 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.780
 marzahn raw material or sugar and 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.400
 Dyes and so you good 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.650
 can clear up with my race here 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.250
 powdered sugar and no nearness 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.780
 because if you take mail then it starts 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.669
 marzipan at some point it to ferment if 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.520
 to stand the 102 days and pie 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:36.289
 then you can not eat anymore and 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.820
 powdered sugar or sugar is also the 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:40.220
 main ingredient at marzipan therefore 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:44.289
 it is not that bad either 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:48.710
 Everything is beautiful here 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:51.110
 mixed is the trick is natural 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.270
 actually re- starts from the inside 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.960
 So start getting outside in the middle 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:05:03.190
 then left to right down 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:03.190
 up there again from the inside out 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:17.750
 until you reach the shape of the heart 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:21.199
 then take with the knife like that 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:24.110
 finished now toto wolff so and then puts 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:31.340
 Just put the match on the lid 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:32.900
 the pie baking paper will take one 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:37.060
 snow longer side like the other one 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.060
 means a bit diagonally 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:53.190
 then the long side up then 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:06:03.070
 once a role 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:06:05.650
 Turn the paper and you build yourself 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:08.190
 have a bag still commenting 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:08.190
 can make 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.190
 final touches with my beautiful the 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:27.400
 can cover here borders 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:27.400
 roasted almonds easy to tackle here 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:38.640
 the plate is finished now I think so 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:39.090
 again war the baked or hanging 

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.610
 to bake 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:46.320
 In any case, just write once and 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:48.920
 makes time for a whole new Fikrt alex 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.920
 ciao
