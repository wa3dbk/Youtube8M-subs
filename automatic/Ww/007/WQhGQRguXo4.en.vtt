Justin Fuente in Lane Kiffin I'm just a

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.860 
Justin Fuente in Lane Kiffin I'm just a
little<00:00:46.829> bit<00:00:46.920> younger<00:00:47.039> than<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.660> give<00:00:48.660> me<00:00:48.750> your

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
little bit younger than you give me your

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.330 
little bit younger than you give me your
thoughts<00:00:49.050> on<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.200> question<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.039> hear<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.280> all

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
thoughts on that question I hear it all

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.830 
thoughts on that question I hear it all
the<00:00:50.399> time<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.789> know<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:51.059> he's<00:00:51.300> too<00:00:51.510> young<00:00:51.539> is

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
the time you know is he's too young is

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.350 
the time you know is he's too young is
that<00:00:51.960> valid<00:00:52.140> or<00:00:52.440> not<00:00:52.520> well<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.550> don't<00:00:53.940> believe

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
that valid or not well I don't believe

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.029 
that valid or not well I don't believe
it's<00:00:54.570> valid<00:00:54.989> from<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.260> standpoint<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:55.980> you

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
it's valid from a standpoint that you

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.950 
it's valid from a standpoint that you
know<00:00:56.309> age<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:56.579> just<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:57.059> number<00:00:57.090> it's<00:00:57.629> something

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
know age is just a number it's something

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.110 
know age is just a number it's something
that's<00:00:58.230> out<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.379> your<00:00:58.530> control<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:59.460> think

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
that's out of your control I think

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.910 
that's out of your control I think
what's<00:01:00.300> more<00:01:00.539> important<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.230> evaluation

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
what's more important is the evaluation

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.340 
what's more important is the evaluation
of<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.340> coach<00:01:02.550> as<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.820> leader<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.390> as<00:01:04.080> someone

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
of the coach as a leader and as someone

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.070 
of the coach as a leader and as someone
that's<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.589> right<00:01:04.769> fit<00:01:05.010> for<00:01:05.070> your<00:01:05.309> program<00:01:05.519> and

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
that's a right fit for your program and

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.570 
that's a right fit for your program and
you<00:01:07.080> know<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.530> know<00:01:07.860> that's<00:01:08.100> going<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.310> always

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
you know I know that's going to always

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.770 
you know I know that's going to always
get<00:01:08.670> analyzed<00:01:09.119> when<00:01:09.420> he's<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.570> great

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
get analyzed when he's a great

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.030 
get analyzed when he's a great
coordinator<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.500> he's<00:01:10.619> going<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.770> be<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:10.920> great

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
coordinator so he's going to be a great

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.190 
coordinator so he's going to be a great
head<00:01:11.310> coach<00:01:11.520> choice<00:01:11.880> he's<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:13.020> know<00:01:13.049> he's

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
head coach choice he's you know he's

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.320 
head coach choice he's you know he's
been<00:01:13.830> coaching<00:01:14.070> for<00:01:14.220> 25<00:01:14.760> years<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.150> going<00:01:15.270> to

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
been coaching for 25 years is going to

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.630 
been coaching for 25 years is going to
be<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.420> great<00:01:15.540> head<00:01:15.780> coach<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.490> think<00:01:17.490> it's<00:01:17.580> more

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
be a great head coach I think it's more

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.310 
be a great head coach I think it's more
about<00:01:17.880> an<00:01:18.270> athletic<00:01:18.720> director<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.259> a

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
about an athletic director and a

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.440 
about an athletic director and a
president<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.490> know<00:01:20.520> finding<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.030> right<00:01:21.210> fit

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
president you know finding the right fit

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.179 
president you know finding the right fit
for<00:01:21.509> their<00:01:21.840> program<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.619> culture<00:01:23.040> that

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
for their program and the culture that

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.859 
for their program and the culture that
they<00:01:23.310> want<00:01:23.549> within<00:01:23.759> their<00:01:24.000> program<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.720> I

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
they want within their program and I

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.380 
they want within their program and I
really<00:01:25.740> think<00:01:25.890> age<00:01:26.159> has<00:01:26.189> very<00:01:26.759> little<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.150> do

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
really think age has very little to do

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.240 
really think age has very little to do
with<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:27.960> there's<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.740> ton<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.009> great

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
with it and there's a ton of great

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.039 
with it and there's a ton of great
coaches<00:01:29.700> out<00:01:29.790> there<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.390> think<00:01:30.900> that's

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
coaches out there and I think that's

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.780 
coaches out there and I think that's
probably<00:01:31.229> pretty<00:01:31.560> low<00:01:31.829> on<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.100> list<00:01:32.220> of

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
probably pretty low on the list of

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.340 
probably pretty low on the list of
