one<00:01:27.190> of<00:01:27.280> the<00:01:27.340> principal<00:01:27.760> reasons<00:01:27.790> we<00:01:28.270> use

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299 
one of the principal reasons we use

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:30.660 
one of the principal reasons we use
aluminium<00:01:28.960> is<00:01:29.170> for<00:01:29.620> light<00:01:29.740> weight<00:01:29.979> the

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
aluminium is for light weight the

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.580 
aluminium is for light weight the
intention<00:01:31.150> is<00:01:31.299> to<00:01:31.330> save<00:01:31.720> as<00:01:31.870> much<00:01:32.140> weight<00:01:32.440> as

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
intention is to save as much weight as

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.289 
intention is to save as much weight as
possible<00:01:32.650> on<00:01:33.070> the<00:01:33.159> body<00:01:33.369> so<00:01:33.729> we<00:01:33.760> can<00:01:33.880> get<00:01:34.150> the

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
possible on the body so we can get the

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.270 
possible on the body so we can get the
secondary<00:01:34.780> weight<00:01:34.930> saves<00:01:35.260> in<00:01:35.680> the<00:01:35.860> vehicle

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
secondary weight saves in the vehicle

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.690 
secondary weight saves in the vehicle
and<00:01:36.520> that<00:01:36.940> adds<00:01:37.240> to<00:01:37.479> a<00:01:37.900> big<00:01:38.380> change<00:01:38.920> in<00:01:39.400> the

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
and that adds to a big change in the

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.490 
and that adds to a big change in the
performance<00:01:40.240> of<00:01:40.299> the<00:01:40.360> vehicle<00:01:40.720> not<00:01:40.960> only<00:01:41.290> in

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
performance of the vehicle not only in

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.469 
performance of the vehicle not only in
the<00:01:41.619> attributes<00:01:42.070> such<00:01:42.549> as<00:01:42.580> ride<00:01:43.030> and<00:01:43.180> handling

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
the attributes such as ride and handling

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.630 
the attributes such as ride and handling
and<00:01:43.659> dynamics<00:01:44.110> but<00:01:44.619> also<00:01:44.830> improves<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:45.430> fuel

are<00:01:50.560> a<00:01:50.590> lot<00:01:50.830> of<00:01:50.860> urban<00:01:51.460> myths<00:01:51.670> of<00:01:51.850> the

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
are a lot of urban myths of the

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.480 
are a lot of urban myths of the
aluminium<00:01:52.260> however<00:01:53.260> the<00:01:53.860> reality<00:01:54.189> is

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
aluminium however the reality is

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.359 
aluminium however the reality is
aluminium<00:01:55.420> absorbs<00:01:56.320> more<00:01:56.619> energy<00:01:57.040> per

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
aluminium absorbs more energy per

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.600 
aluminium absorbs more energy per
kilogram<00:01:57.970> sort<00:01:58.960> of<00:01:59.049> steel<00:01:59.290> so<00:02:00.100> if<00:02:00.159> you<00:02:00.369> make

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
kilogram sort of steel so if you make

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.520 
kilogram sort of steel so if you make
something<00:02:00.880> of<00:02:01.119> aluminium<00:02:01.390> not<00:02:02.140> only<00:02:02.350> do<00:02:02.439> you

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
something of aluminium not only do you

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.859 
something of aluminium not only do you
make<00:02:02.710> it<00:02:02.890> light<00:02:03.130> but<00:02:04.000> you<00:02:04.060> actually<00:02:04.360> make<00:02:04.689> it

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
make it light but you actually make it

exceeds<00:02:16.450> by<00:02:17.170> a<00:02:17.350> significant<00:02:18.040> amount<00:02:18.310> that

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
exceeds by a significant amount that

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.110 
exceeds by a significant amount that
test<00:02:19.180> so<00:02:20.049> aluminium<00:02:21.010> is<00:02:21.250> a<00:02:21.280> good<00:02:21.579> material<00:02:22.030> of

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
test so aluminium is a good material of

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.690 
test so aluminium is a good material of
choice<00:02:22.150> not<00:02:22.690> only<00:02:22.989> for<00:02:23.200> light<00:02:23.380> weight<00:02:23.650> but<00:02:24.549> the

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
choice not only for light weight but the

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.839 
choice not only for light weight but the
great<00:02:25.060> strength<00:02:25.510> as<00:02:25.720> well

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.940 

the<00:02:29.390> only<00:02:29.569> Ranger<00:02:30.110> over<00:02:30.200> to<00:02:30.469> the<00:02:30.560> so<00:02:30.709> little

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
the only Ranger over to the so little

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.500 
the only Ranger over to the so little
plant<00:02:31.189> has<00:02:31.340> been<00:02:31.459> a<00:02:31.489> huge<00:02:31.849> change<00:02:32.120> and<00:02:32.329> it's

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
plant has been a huge change and it's

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.809 
plant has been a huge change and it's
not<00:02:32.659> just<00:02:32.930> a<00:02:33.019> change<00:02:33.260> to<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.159> physicals<00:02:34.640> and

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
not just a change to the physicals and

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.309 
not just a change to the physicals and
the<00:02:34.939> product<00:02:35.329> and<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.540> plant<00:02:35.780> it's<00:02:35.989> a<00:02:36.109> big

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
the product and the plant it's a big

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.500 
the product and the plant it's a big
change<00:02:36.730> culturally<00:02:37.730> as<00:02:37.819> well<00:02:37.969> it's<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.269> first

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
change culturally as well it's the first

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.349 
change culturally as well it's the first
vehicle<00:02:38.989> off<00:02:39.079> a<00:02:39.170> brand<00:02:39.439> new<00:02:39.530> all<00:02:39.829> aluminium

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
architecture so there's a lot of

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.860 
architecture so there's a lot of
pioneering<00:02:42.819> in<00:02:43.819> this<00:02:43.939> vehicle<00:02:44.510> it's<00:02:44.719> the

the products and our manufacturing

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:10.569 
the products and our manufacturing
facilities<00:03:09.019> is<00:03:09.260> extremely<00:03:09.829> important<00:03:10.280> to<00:03:10.310> us

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
facilities is extremely important to us

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:12.759 
facilities is extremely important to us
less<00:03:10.849> well-known<00:03:11.150> is<00:03:11.540> the<00:03:12.139> amount<00:03:12.409> of<00:03:12.500> effort

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
less well-known is the amount of effort

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.460 
less well-known is the amount of effort
we've<00:03:13.040> put<00:03:13.280> into<00:03:13.459> designing<00:03:14.450> the<00:03:14.810> process<00:03:15.290> and

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
we've put into designing the process and

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:16.960 
we've put into designing the process and
facilities<00:03:15.980> to<00:03:16.010> be<00:03:16.220> much<00:03:16.430> more<00:03:16.639> sustainable

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
facilities to be much more sustainable

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.110 
facilities to be much more sustainable
so<00:03:17.419> for<00:03:17.659> example<00:03:18.260> an<00:03:18.500> aluminium<00:03:18.950> body<00:03:19.819> shop

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
so for example an aluminium body shop

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.809 
so for example an aluminium body shop
where<00:03:20.389> we<00:03:21.079> have<00:03:21.260> riveting<00:03:21.739> as<00:03:22.159> opposed<00:03:22.609> to<00:03:22.730> a

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
where we have riveting as opposed to a

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:24.670 
where we have riveting as opposed to a
steel<00:03:23.120> body<00:03:23.329> shop<00:03:23.599> with<00:03:23.750> welding<00:03:24.139> you<00:03:24.560> know

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
steel body shop with welding you know

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.920 
steel body shop with welding you know
consumes<00:03:25.159> far<00:03:25.519> less<00:03:25.730> energy<00:03:26.180> than<00:03:26.359> a<00:03:26.540> welding

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
consumes far less energy than a welding

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.289 
consumes far less energy than a welding
body<00:03:27.139> shop<00:03:27.409> so<00:03:27.620> by<00:03:27.950> definition<00:03:28.340> an<00:03:29.090> all

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
body shop so by definition an all

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
aluminium body shell with riveting is

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.909 
aluminium body shell with riveting is
far<00:03:31.879> more<00:03:32.060> efficient<00:03:32.510> far<00:03:33.019> cleaner<00:03:33.379> what
