00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:21.430
 Somewhere very lonely 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.260
 But at the same time, bright 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.560
 A dream shines in the sky 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.190
 The world is huge spinning yula 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.230
 Many years in a row 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:45.890
 Does God really not need us? 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.730
 If the Garden of Eden is already broken for us 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.920
 In your ark soon I want to get 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.460
 Perfect paradise is possible, so know 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.370
 If your dream will live 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.170
 Clean as a tear 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:15.120
 Just take her alone with us on the road 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.310
 We will arrive soon 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.410
 And the soul is sweet 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.470
 Poured syrup peace 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.110
 Even the wind from the deep darkness 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.400
 What brings with sadness 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:01.200
 We are not afraid now and forever 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.930
 And there will be no more disastrous anguish 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.530
 Where the sage could dream 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.620
 New home will be a marvelous asteroid 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.100
 Here we will live with you together 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.290
 Only you covet 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:30.020
 And your dream will come true soon 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.010
 If the Garden of Eden is already broken for us 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.150
 In your ark soon I want to get 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.770
 Perfect paradise is possible, so know 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.620
 If your dream will live 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.700
 Clean as a tear 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:33.380
 Only her alone, with us you take the road
