built for me I taught him how to build
bikes<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.340> that<00:00:35.460> was<00:00:35.579> kind<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:35.880> in<00:00:36.059> training

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
bikes and that was kind of in training

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.720 
bikes and that was kind of in training
it's<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.260> city<00:00:37.469> bike<00:00:37.649> has<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.100> basket<00:00:38.610> on<00:00:38.670> the

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
it's a city bike has a basket on the

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.330 
it's a city bike has a basket on the
front<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.750> basket<00:00:40.200> fits<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.559> grocery<00:00:40.980> bag<00:00:41.010> in

front the basket fits a grocery bag in
it<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:42.829> was<00:00:43.829> writing<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.489> single<00:00:44.969> speed<00:00:45.180> bike

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
it I was writing a single speed bike

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.150 
it I was writing a single speed bike
actually<00:00:45.629> up<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.110> Seattle<00:00:46.530> which<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:46.829> guess<00:00:46.980> is

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
actually up to Seattle which I guess is

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.619 
actually up to Seattle which I guess is
a<00:00:47.190> couple<00:00:47.610> hundred<00:00:47.700> miles<00:00:48.149> away<00:00:48.270> from<00:00:48.420> here<00:00:50.629> so

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
a couple hundred miles away from here so

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.200 
a couple hundred miles away from here so
I'm<00:00:51.719> riding<00:00:51.930> along<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.860> look<00:00:53.460> across<00:00:53.610> to

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
I'm riding along and I look across to

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.729 
I'm riding along and I look across to
high<00:00:54.539> five<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.170> there<00:00:55.289> are<00:00:55.410> just<00:00:55.559> these

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
high five and there are just these

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.260 
high five and there are just these
massive<00:00:56.280> vehicles<00:00:57.469> so<00:00:58.469> complicated<00:00:59.399> this

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
massive vehicles so complicated this

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.349 
massive vehicles so complicated this
huge<00:01:00.750> kind<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.140> Fortress<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.949> machine<00:01:02.359> then

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
huge kind of Fortress of a machine then

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.539 
huge kind of Fortress of a machine then
I<00:01:03.420> was<00:01:03.570> looking<00:01:03.899> down<00:01:03.930> at<00:01:04.229> my<00:01:04.350> bike<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.860> pedals

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
I was looking down at my bike and pedals

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.270 
I was looking down at my bike and pedals
cranks<00:01:06.479> chained<00:01:07.820> cog<00:01:09.170> going<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:11.070> wheel

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
cranks chained cog going to the wheel

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.590 
cranks chained cog going to the wheel
and<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.670> tire<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.150> that's<00:01:12.330> what's

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
and the tire and that's what's

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.020 
and the tire and that's what's
contacting<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.470> road<00:01:13.680> just<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:14.520> efficient

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
contacting the road just so efficient

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.340 
contacting the road just so efficient
and<00:01:15.210> that's<00:01:15.270> when<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.750> haven't<00:01:16.049> really<00:01:16.229> thought

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
and that's when I haven't really thought

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.690 
and that's when I haven't really thought
about<00:01:16.409> bikes<00:01:16.830> in<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.100> way<00:01:17.220> before<00:01:17.280> like<00:01:17.670> I

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
about bikes in that way before like I

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.520 
about bikes in that way before like I
love<00:01:17.970> bikes<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.450> loved<00:01:18.630> riding<00:01:18.869> bikes<00:01:19.200> up

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
love bikes I loved riding bikes up

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.800 
love bikes I loved riding bikes up
racing<00:01:19.950> bikes<00:01:20.159> but<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.030> hadn't<00:01:21.450> realized<00:01:22.170> what

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
racing bikes but I hadn't realized what

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.480 
racing bikes but I hadn't realized what
what<00:01:24.079> an<00:01:24.259> incredible<00:01:25.600> invention<00:01:26.600> that<00:01:27.380> is<00:01:27.680> the

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
what an incredible invention that is the

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.969 
what an incredible invention that is the
bike<00:01:28.700> is<00:01:28.909> really<00:01:29.090> just<00:01:29.479> so<00:01:29.979> beautifully

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
bike is really just so beautifully

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:38.610 
bike is really just so beautifully
simple<00:01:31.549> and<00:01:31.850> efficient

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.410 

I<00:01:38.680> especially<00:01:39.460> feel<00:01:39.820> the<00:01:39.970> pressure<00:01:40.180> if

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
I especially feel the pressure if

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.790 
I especially feel the pressure if
somebody's<00:01:40.780> been<00:01:40.930> waiting<00:01:41.320> for<00:01:41.530> a<00:01:41.560> really

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
somebody's been waiting for a really

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.310 
somebody's been waiting for a really
really<00:01:41.920> long<00:01:42.190> time<00:01:42.400> for<00:01:42.910> people<00:01:43.810> that<00:01:43.930> come<00:01:44.140> to

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
really long time for people that come to

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.110 
really long time for people that come to
us<00:01:44.350> they<00:01:44.710> ride<00:01:44.920> bikes<00:01:45.130> a<00:01:45.280> lot<00:01:45.430> they've<00:01:45.850> had<00:01:46.090> a

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120 
us they ride bikes a lot they've had a

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.230 
us they ride bikes a lot they've had a
lot<00:01:46.330> of<00:01:46.390> bikes<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.920> this<00:01:48.790> is<00:01:49.000> something

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
lot of bikes and this is something

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.060 
lot of bikes and this is something
that's<00:01:49.690> going<00:01:49.960> to<00:01:50.020> be<00:01:50.140> really<00:01:50.440> special<00:01:50.710> for

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
that's going to be really special for

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.110

but<00:02:22.830> I<00:02:23.100> love<00:02:23.610> what<00:02:23.730> I<00:02:23.790> do<00:02:25.400> our<00:02:26.400> bikes<00:02:26.640> aren't

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
but I love what I do our bikes aren't

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.090 
but I love what I do our bikes aren't
good<00:02:27.270> because<00:02:27.780> they're<00:02:28.050> handmade<00:02:28.500> they're

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
good because they're handmade they're

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.310 
good because they're handmade they're
not<00:02:29.280> they're<00:02:29.580> not<00:02:29.610> good<00:02:30.150> because<00:02:30.480> of<00:02:30.990> our

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
not they're not good because of our

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.680 
not they're not good because of our
construction<00:02:31.830> methods<00:02:32.430> they're<00:02:33.330> good

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
construction methods they're good

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.360 
construction methods they're good
because<00:02:33.960> of<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.560> whole<00:02:34.710> process<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:35.160> we

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
because of the whole process that we

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.250 
because of the whole process that we
take<00:02:35.550> our<00:02:35.700> customers<00:02:35.850> through<00:02:36.450> fitting<00:02:37.080> them

take our customers through fitting them

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.080 
take our customers through fitting them
and<00:02:37.500> designing<00:02:37.920> a<00:02:38.010> bike<00:02:38.130> specifically<00:02:38.910> for

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
and designing a bike specifically for

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.880 
and designing a bike specifically for
them<00:02:39.210> we're<00:02:39.660> making<00:02:40.050> something<00:02:40.290> from<00:02:40.560> scratch

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
them we're making something from scratch

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.830 
them we're making something from scratch
just<00:02:41.310> for<00:02:41.580> them<00:02:41.730> we<00:02:42.300> talked<00:02:42.510> a<00:02:42.540> little<00:02:42.660> bit

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
just for them we talked a little bit

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.050 
just for them we talked a little bit
about<00:02:42.960> if<00:02:43.350> they<00:02:43.620> have<00:02:43.860> particular<00:02:44.160> parts<00:02:44.850> that

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
about if they have particular parts that

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.250 
about if they have particular parts that
they<00:02:45.180> really<00:02:45.450> love<00:02:45.660> because<00:02:46.080> I<00:02:46.140> have

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
they really love because I have

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.780 
they really love because I have
particular<00:02:46.680> parts<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.130> I<00:02:47.160> love<00:02:47.520> and

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
particular parts that I love and

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.670 
particular parts that I love and
companies<00:02:48.180> that<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:48.600> want<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:48.960> support<00:02:49.260> like

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
companies that I want to support like

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.250 
companies that I want to support like
you<00:02:50.250> know<00:02:50.370> like<00:02:50.640> we<00:02:50.910> are<00:02:51.000> talking<00:02:51.120> about<00:02:51.390> envy

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
you know like we are talking about envy

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.230 
you know like we are talking about envy
and<00:02:52.380> feeling<00:02:52.830> that<00:02:53.010> kinship<00:02:53.580> with<00:02:53.850> companies

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
and feeling that kinship with companies

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.510 
and feeling that kinship with companies
like<00:02:54.270> that<00:02:54.630> left<00:02:55.290> to<00:02:55.410> my<00:02:55.530> own<00:02:55.560> devices<00:02:55.740> that's

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
like that left to my own devices that's

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.300 
like that left to my own devices that's
what<00:02:56.760> I<00:02:56.790> would<00:02:57.000> spec<00:02:57.300> on<00:02:57.510> somebody's<00:02:57.960> bike

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
what I would spec on somebody's bike

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.800 
what I would spec on somebody's bike
when<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.430> bike<00:02:59.550> fits<00:03:00.030> them<00:03:00.270> well<00:03:00.300> and<00:03:00.660> when

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
when the bike fits them well and when

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.770 
when the bike fits them well and when
it's<00:03:00.960> designed<00:03:01.530> to<00:03:02.030> complement<00:03:03.030> that<00:03:03.360> fit

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
it's designed to complement that fit

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.770 
it's designed to complement that fit
they<00:03:04.770> end<00:03:04.980> up<00:03:05.070> with<00:03:05.250> something<00:03:05.460> that<00:03:05.780> that

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
they end up with something that that

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.380 
they end up with something that that
they're<00:03:06.990> just<00:03:07.230> perfectly<00:03:07.620> balanced<00:03:08.160> above

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
they're just perfectly balanced above

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.380 
they're just perfectly balanced above
so<00:03:11.380> really<00:03:11.650> when<00:03:12.220> I<00:03:12.250> started<00:03:12.730> building<00:03:12.970> bikes

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
so really when I started building bikes

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.530 
so really when I started building bikes
I<00:03:14.080> did<00:03:14.560> it<00:03:14.680> because<00:03:14.980> I<00:03:15.580> liked<00:03:15.910> it<00:03:16.120> I<00:03:16.330> did<00:03:16.510> it

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
I did it because I liked it I did it

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.630 
I did it because I liked it I did it
because<00:03:16.810> it<00:03:16.840> was<00:03:16.960> fun<00:03:17.290> and<00:03:17.320> think<00:03:17.920> of<00:03:18.040> it<00:03:18.160> as<00:03:18.400> a

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
because it was fun and think of it as a

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.790 
because it was fun and think of it as a
business<00:03:18.910> that<00:03:19.180> I<00:03:19.390> was<00:03:19.450> going<00:03:19.810> to<00:03:19.930> grow<00:03:20.410> and

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
business that I was going to grow and

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.130 
business that I was going to grow and
have<00:03:21.070> as<00:03:21.250> this<00:03:21.430> long-term<00:03:21.910> thing<00:03:22.210> and<00:03:22.420> then

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
have as this long-term thing and then

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.380 
have as this long-term thing and then
about<00:03:23.320> I<00:03:23.620> guess<00:03:24.220> three<00:03:24.700> and<00:03:24.850> a<00:03:24.880> half<00:03:25.060> years

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
about I guess three and a half years

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.390 
about I guess three and a half years
into<00:03:26.050> building<00:03:26.770> I<00:03:27.750> decided<00:03:28.750> to<00:03:29.110> I<00:03:29.620> was<00:03:30.190> ready
