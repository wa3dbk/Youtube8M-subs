00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
the 380 and the 787 oh I agree with

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.130 
the 380 and the 787 oh I agree with
sugar<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.640> most<00:01:57.090> customers<00:01:57.659> who<00:01:57.840> turn<00:01:58.110> up

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
sugar that to most customers who turn up

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
to the flight they don't particularly

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.969 
to the flight they don't particularly
care<00:02:00.060> what<00:02:00.390> type<00:02:00.719> of<00:02:00.750> aircraft<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.710> as<00:02:01.860> long

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
care what type of aircraft it is as long

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.310 
care what type of aircraft it is as long
as<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.250> goes<00:02:02.399> on<00:02:02.610> time<00:02:02.969> one<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.899> factors

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
as it goes on time one of the factors

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.590 
as it goes on time one of the factors
for<00:02:04.469> us<00:02:04.590> though<00:02:04.890> is<00:02:05.100> in<00:02:05.280> maintaining<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.390> young

for us though is in maintaining a young

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
to do that more efficiently than older

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
reaching the end of their use by date

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000 
reaching the end of their use by date
and<00:02:23.569> do<00:02:23.840> you<00:02:23.900> think<00:02:24.140> that<00:02:24.319> for<00:02:24.530> airports

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
and do you think that for airports

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.050 
and do you think that for airports
around<00:02:25.100> the<00:02:25.310> world<00:02:25.520> for<00:02:25.610> instance<00:02:25.940> like

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
around the world for instance like

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.809 
around the world for instance like
Heathrow<00:02:26.600> which<00:02:27.170> is<00:02:27.319> this<00:02:27.500> notorious<00:02:28.400> for<00:02:28.790> its

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
Heathrow which is this notorious for its

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.750 
Heathrow which is this notorious for its
facilities<00:02:29.540> and<00:02:29.870> the<00:02:29.900> delays<00:02:30.410> for<00:02:31.069> I<00:02:31.550> mean

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
facilities and the delays for I mean

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.309 
facilities and the delays for I mean
Heathrow<00:02:32.090> obviously<00:02:32.540> has<00:02:32.690> to<00:02:32.720> love<00:02:32.989> an

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
Heathrow obviously has to love an

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.020 
Heathrow obviously has to love an
airplane<00:02:33.830> like<00:02:34.100> the<00:02:34.250> a380<00:02:34.610> because<00:02:34.819> you<00:02:34.910> get

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
airplane like the a380 because you get

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.470 
airplane like the a380 because you get
more<00:02:35.239> people<00:02:35.540> coming<00:02:35.780> in<00:02:36.080> in<00:02:36.230> one<00:02:36.980> go<00:02:37.430> do<00:02:38.120> do

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
more people coming in in one go do do

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.970 
more people coming in in one go do do
you<00:02:38.540> think<00:02:38.750> this<00:02:38.870> will<00:02:39.200> be<00:02:39.319> the<00:02:39.410> case<00:02:39.590> for<00:02:39.650> many

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
you think this will be the case for many

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.820 
you think this will be the case for many
other<00:02:40.160> airports<00:02:40.640> LAX<00:02:41.180> JFK<00:02:41.900> I<00:02:42.230> think<00:02:42.560> it<00:02:42.620> has<00:02:42.769> to

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
other airports LAX JFK I think it has to

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.130 
other airports LAX JFK I think it has to
be<00:02:43.130> I<00:02:43.310> mean<00:02:43.489> right<00:02:43.730> now<00:02:43.790> we<00:02:44.030> want<00:02:44.510> to<00:02:44.600> put<00:02:44.780> more

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
be I mean right now we want to put more

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.290 
be I mean right now we want to put more
people<00:02:45.650> into<00:02:46.010> London<00:02:46.370> people<00:02:46.820> are<00:02:46.940> telling<00:02:47.120> us

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
people into London people are telling us

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.000 
people into London people are telling us
I<00:02:47.480> can't<00:02:47.750> get<00:02:47.959> on<00:02:48.080> your<00:02:48.230> flights<00:02:48.470> to<00:02:48.680> London

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
I can't get on your flights to London

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.160 
I can't get on your flights to London
the<00:02:49.610> reason<00:02:50.000> we<00:02:50.180> can't<00:02:50.480> put<00:02:50.720> more<00:02:50.900> flights

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
the reason we can't put more flights

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.050 
the reason we can't put more flights
into<00:02:51.410> London<00:02:51.739> we<00:02:51.800> can't<00:02:52.070> buy<00:02:52.280> slots<00:02:52.670> they're

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
into London we can't buy slots they're

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.270 
into London we can't buy slots they're
just<00:02:53.090> simply<00:02:53.600> aren't<00:02:53.870> any<00:02:54.080> available<00:02:54.620> so<00:02:55.069> for

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
just simply aren't any available so for

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.250 
just simply aren't any available so for
us<00:02:55.310> to<00:02:55.550> put<00:02:55.700> more<00:02:55.910> people<00:02:56.180> on<00:02:56.630> our<00:02:56.780> flights

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
us to put more people on our flights

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.660 
us to put more people on our flights
into<00:02:57.500> London<00:02:57.860> we<00:02:57.980> have<00:02:58.130> to<00:02:58.250> use<00:02:58.400> bigger

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
into London we have to use bigger

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.600 
into London we have to use bigger
aircraft<00:02:58.910> until<00:02:59.900> today<00:03:00.290> no<00:03:00.980> aircraft<00:03:01.310> has

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
aircraft until today no aircraft has

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:02.890 
aircraft until today no aircraft has
been<00:03:01.760> bigger<00:03:02.000> than<00:03:02.209> the<00:03:02.300> one<00:03:02.450> we<00:03:02.569> use<00:03:02.750> to

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
been bigger than the one we use to

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.380 
been bigger than the one we use to
London<00:03:03.170> please<00:03:03.830> elaborate<00:03:04.370> on<00:03:04.430> why<00:03:04.790> John<00:03:05.209> Lee

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
London please elaborate on why John Lee

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.880 
London please elaborate on why John Lee
he<00:03:05.569> is<00:03:05.720> calling<00:03:05.989> this<00:03:06.170> the<00:03:06.230> gentle<00:03:06.709> Green

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
he is calling this the gentle Green

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.500 
he is calling this the gentle Green
Giant<00:03:07.220> you<00:03:07.310> know<00:03:07.370> it<00:03:07.580> doesn't<00:03:07.760> make<00:03:07.970> sense<00:03:08.030> big

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
Giant you know it doesn't make sense big

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.620 
Giant you know it doesn't make sense big
means<00:03:09.050> gas<00:03:09.500> guzzler<00:03:09.980> storage<00:03:10.580> yeah<00:03:11.180> so<00:03:11.209> you're

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
means gas guzzler storage yeah so you're

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.360 
means gas guzzler storage yeah so you're
on<00:03:11.750> I<00:03:11.870> think<00:03:12.080> this<00:03:12.200> is<00:03:12.319> the<00:03:12.500> this<00:03:12.680> is<00:03:12.739> a<00:03:12.860> it's<00:03:13.280> a

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
on I think this is the this is a it's a

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.210 
on I think this is the this is a it's a
perception<00:03:13.880> that<00:03:14.060> big<00:03:14.660> means<00:03:14.959> bad<00:03:15.230> in<00:03:15.980> fact

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
perception that big means bad in fact

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.580 
perception that big means bad in fact
you<00:03:16.489> can<00:03:16.640> actually<00:03:16.820> you<00:03:17.750> can<00:03:17.900> actually<00:03:18.049> use

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
you can actually you can actually use

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.530 
you can actually you can actually use
better<00:03:18.920> technology<00:03:19.670> to<00:03:19.880> build<00:03:20.030> big<00:03:20.329> aircraft

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
better technology to build big aircraft

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.470 
better technology to build big aircraft
and<00:03:21.079> derive<00:03:21.350> benefits<00:03:22.030> this<00:03:23.030> is<00:03:23.209> the<00:03:23.329> most

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
and derive benefits this is the most

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.810 
and derive benefits this is the most
fuel-efficient<00:03:24.290> aircraft<00:03:24.470> ever<00:03:24.920> built<00:03:25.130> and

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
fuel-efficient aircraft ever built and

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.039 
fuel-efficient aircraft ever built and
sure<00:03:26.000> gonna<00:03:26.180> have<00:03:26.360> to<00:03:26.450> let<00:03:26.540> you<00:03:26.600> jumping<00:03:26.959> you

they're<00:07:33.820> operating<00:07:34.510> previously<00:07:35.320> they've

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:35.470 
they're operating previously they've

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:36.840 
they're operating previously they've
been<00:07:35.620> working<00:07:35.920> with<00:07:36.040> simulators<00:07:36.640> with

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:36.850 
been working with simulators with

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:39.090 
been working with simulators with
mock-ups<00:07:37.810> but<00:07:38.170> now<00:07:38.320> they're<00:07:38.560> working<00:07:38.950> with<00:07:39.070> a

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:39.100 
mock-ups but now they're working with a

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.730 
mock-ups but now they're working with a
real<00:07:39.370> deal<00:07:39.990> earlier<00:07:40.990> i<00:07:41.050> was<00:07:41.350> talking<00:07:41.710> to

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:41.740 
real deal earlier i was talking to

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.710 
real deal earlier i was talking to
another<00:07:42.010> eggs<00:07:42.250> to<00:07:42.730> the<00:07:42.850> same<00:07:43.030> executive<00:07:43.570> and

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:43.720 
another eggs to the same executive and

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.390 
another eggs to the same executive and
he<00:07:43.810> was<00:07:43.930> saying<00:07:44.080> basically<00:07:44.590> we<00:07:44.950> have<00:07:44.980> to<00:07:45.190> treat

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:45.400 
he was saying basically we have to treat

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:49.090 
he was saying basically we have to treat
this<00:07:45.630> 8080<00:07:46.630> i<00:07:46.870> think

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:49.100 
this 8080 i think

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.700 
this 8080 i think
make<00:07:49.970> sure<00:07:50.000> they<00:07:50.270> don't<00:07:50.300> break<00:07:51.080> any<00:07:51.320> parts

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:51.710 
make sure they don't break any parts

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:53.830 
make sure they don't break any parts
because<00:07:51.920> are<00:07:52.100> they<00:07:52.220> you<00:07:53.210> know<00:07:53.300> waited<00:07:53.630> a<00:07:53.690> long

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:53.840 
because are they you know waited a long

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.440 
because are they you know waited a long
time<00:07:53.900> for<00:07:54.170> this
