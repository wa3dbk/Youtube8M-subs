00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
after new normal now this is a little

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.450 
after new normal now this is a little
sealed<00:00:03.259> lead-acid<00:00:04.259> battery<00:00:05.009> which<00:00:05.190> came<00:00:05.430> out

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
sealed lead-acid battery which came out

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.990 
sealed lead-acid battery which came out
of<00:00:05.759> one<00:00:05.879> of<00:00:05.910> those<00:00:06.120> cheap<00:00:06.899> car<00:00:07.859> jumped<00:00:08.400> starter

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
of one of those cheap car jumped starter

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.459 
of one of those cheap car jumped starter
sets<00:00:11.300> founded<00:00:12.300> in<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.450> street<00:00:12.840> and<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.259> first

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
sets founded in the street and the first

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.680 
sets founded in the street and the first
thing<00:00:13.590> you<00:00:13.710> notice<00:00:14.009> is<00:00:14.130> it's<00:00:14.340> very<00:00:14.400> light<00:00:14.969> and

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
thing you notice is it's very light and

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.140 
thing you notice is it's very light and
I<00:00:15.929> know<00:00:15.990> these<00:00:16.289> batteries<00:00:16.770> are<00:00:16.920> utter<00:00:17.580> rubbish

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
I know these batteries are utter rubbish

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.830 
I know these batteries are utter rubbish
because<00:00:18.920> ain't<00:00:19.920> big<00:00:20.250> ain't<00:00:20.550> clever<00:00:20.970> did<00:00:21.510> a

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
because ain't big ain't clever did a

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.410 
because ain't big ain't clever did a
kind<00:00:22.529> of<00:00:22.650> review<00:00:23.070> on<00:00:23.189> these<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.760> he<00:00:23.970> took<00:00:24.300> them

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
kind of review on these and he took them

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.060 
kind of review on these and he took them
apart<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:24.900> found<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.170> there's<00:00:25.380> just<00:00:26.010> very

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
apart and found that there's just very

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.920 
apart and found that there's just very
little<00:00:26.279> LED<00:00:26.760> in<00:00:26.970> them<00:00:27.210> I'll<00:00:27.390> put<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.599> link<00:00:27.810> to

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
little LED in them I'll put a link to

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.529 
little LED in them I'll put a link to
his<00:00:28.400> video<00:00:29.400> because<00:00:29.699> it's<00:00:29.939> very<00:00:30.090> interesting

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
his video because it's very interesting

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.620 
his video because it's very interesting
it's<00:00:30.660> worth<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.929> watch<00:00:31.250> but<00:00:32.250> I've<00:00:33.030> just<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.480> was

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
it's worth a watch but I've just I was

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.350 
it's worth a watch but I've just I was
going<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.809> use<00:00:33.930> this<00:00:34.110> in<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.640> solar<00:00:35.640> light<00:00:35.880> that

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
going to use this in a solar light that

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.510 
going to use this in a solar light that
I<00:00:36.390> want<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.840> build<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.170> high-power<00:00:37.620> garden

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
I want to build a high-power garden

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.950 
I want to build a high-power garden
solar<00:00:38.850> light<00:00:39.120> but<00:00:39.329> I've<00:00:39.420> just<00:00:39.450> discovered

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
solar light but I've just discovered

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.959 
solar light but I've just discovered
that<00:00:40.370> it's<00:00:41.370> measuring<00:00:41.910> almost<00:00:42.210> zero<00:00:43.110> volts<00:00:43.969> so

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
that it's measuring almost zero volts so

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.400 
that it's measuring almost zero volts so
as<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.300> stands<00:00:45.570> at<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.870> moment<00:00:46.020> it's

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
as it stands at the moment it's

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.250 
as it stands at the moment it's
measuring<00:00:47.000> half<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.210> volt<00:00:48.450> across<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.050> battery

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
measuring half a volt across the battery

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.200 
measuring half a volt across the battery
let's<00:00:50.010> see<00:00:50.129> what<00:00:50.250> happens<00:00:50.489> when<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.640> put<00:00:51.180> a

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
let's see what happens when I put a

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.479 
let's see what happens when I put a
solar<00:00:51.539> panel<00:00:51.809> on<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.410> try<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:52.949> charge<00:00:53.309> it

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
solar panel on it to try and charge it

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.299 
solar panel on it to try and charge it
up<00:00:54.050> so<00:00:55.050> that's<00:00:55.350> gone<00:00:55.760> 220<00:00:56.840> 1.8<00:00:57.840> volts<00:00:58.260> which<00:00:59.129> is

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
up so that's gone 220 1.8 volts which is

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.069 
up so that's gone 220 1.8 volts which is
pretty<00:00:59.609> much<00:00:59.879> what<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.300> open<00:01:00.660> circuit

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
pretty much what the open circuit

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.529 
pretty much what the open circuit
voltage<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.760> solar<00:01:02.760> panels<00:01:03.090> going<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.390> be

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
voltage of that solar panels going to be

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.310 
voltage of that solar panels going to be
so<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:03.899> battery<00:01:04.670> appears<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.939> be<00:01:06.150> well<00:01:07.049> high

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
so this battery appears to be well high

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.560 
so this battery appears to be well high
resistance<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:08.189> don't<00:01:08.880> think<00:01:09.119> that's<00:01:09.299> going<00:01:09.510> to

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
resistance I don't think that's going to

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.060 
resistance I don't think that's going to
charge<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:10.140> certainly<00:01:10.439> wouldn't<00:01:10.650> sustain<00:01:10.860> a

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
charge it certainly wouldn't sustain a

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.130 
charge it certainly wouldn't sustain a
high<00:01:11.369> current<00:01:11.479> so<00:01:12.479> it'd<00:01:12.540> be<00:01:12.630> pretty<00:01:12.780> useless

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
high current so it'd be pretty useless

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.870 
high current so it'd be pretty useless
for<00:01:13.500> starting<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:14.040> car<00:01:14.310> which<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:14.610> obviously

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
for starting a car which is obviously

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.850 
for starting a car which is obviously
why<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.090> thing<00:01:15.900> was<00:01:16.020> out<00:01:16.170> in<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.470> street<00:01:16.830> and

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
why the thing was out in the street and

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.690 
why the thing was out in the street and
have<00:01:17.100> been<00:01:17.360> thrown<00:01:18.360> away<00:01:18.509> effectively<00:01:19.700> but

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
have been thrown away effectively but

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
have been thrown away effectively but
there's<00:01:20.850> something<00:01:21.030> else<00:01:21.090> that's<00:01:21.330> weird

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
there's something else that's weird

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.980 
there's something else that's weird
about<00:01:22.049> this<00:01:22.549> thing<00:01:23.549> probably<00:01:24.119> because<00:01:24.869> it

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
about this thing probably because it

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.499 
about this thing probably because it
pause<00:01:25.229> in<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.799> street<00:01:26.040> for<00:01:26.070> some<00:01:26.310> time<00:01:26.670> when<00:01:27.360> I

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
pause in the street for some time when I

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.899 
pause in the street for some time when I
shake<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:30.799> it<00:01:31.799> sounds<00:01:32.159> like<00:01:32.310> it's<00:01:32.490> full<00:01:32.759> of

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
shake it it sounds like it's full of

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.880 
shake it it sounds like it's full of
well<00:01:33.509> water<00:01:34.079> or<00:01:34.759> acid<00:01:35.869> who<00:01:36.869> knows<00:01:37.140> now<00:01:37.710> if<00:01:37.770> I

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
well water or acid who knows now if I

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:45.499 
well water or acid who knows now if I
tip<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.159> upside<00:01:38.310> down<00:01:41.240> liquid<00:01:42.920> drips<00:01:43.920> out<00:01:44.509> now

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
tip it upside down liquid drips out now

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.240 
tip it upside down liquid drips out now
I<00:01:45.540> don't<00:01:45.750> have<00:01:46.079> any<00:01:46.259> litmus<00:01:46.979> paper

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
I don't have any litmus paper

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.510 
I don't have any litmus paper
unfortunately<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.680> can't<00:01:50.070> really<00:01:50.189> tell<00:01:50.399> if

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
unfortunately so I can't really tell if

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.740 
unfortunately so I can't really tell if
that's<00:01:50.700> water<00:01:50.939> or<00:01:51.299> acid<00:01:52.009> or<00:01:53.009> can<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.540> so<00:01:54.540> what

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
that's water or acid or can I so what

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.440 
that's water or acid or can I so what
I've<00:01:54.840> got<00:01:54.990> here<00:01:55.140> are<00:01:55.380> some<00:01:55.619> tums<00:01:56.159> which<00:01:57.149> are

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
I've got here are some tums which are

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.010 
I've got here are some tums which are
indigestion<00:01:58.100> tablets<00:01:59.420> calcium<00:02:00.420> carbonate

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
indigestion tablets calcium carbonate

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.240 
indigestion tablets calcium carbonate
they're<00:02:01.380> alkali<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.130> some<00:02:03.000> Jif<00:02:03.479> lemon<00:02:04.350> which

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
they're alkali and some Jif lemon which

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.229 
they're alkali and some Jif lemon which
is<00:02:05.990> acid<00:02:06.990> citric<00:02:07.469> acid<00:02:07.799> so<00:02:08.580> let's<00:02:09.090> try<00:02:09.209> a

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
is acid citric acid so let's try a

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.570 
is acid citric acid so let's try a
little<00:02:09.330> experiment<00:02:09.920> so<00:02:10.920> here's<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.280> couple<00:02:11.459> of

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
little experiment so here's a couple of

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.930 
little experiment so here's a couple of
tums

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
tums

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.890 
tums
now<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.360> one<00:02:13.540> on<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:13.810> left<00:02:14.200> is<00:02:14.530> sitting<00:02:15.520> in

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
now the one on the left is sitting in

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.780 
now the one on the left is sitting in
some<00:02:16.900> of<00:02:17.020> that<00:02:17.170> liquid<00:02:17.500> which<00:02:18.130> is<00:02:18.520> either

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
some of that liquid which is either

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.030 
some of that liquid which is either
water<00:02:19.120> or<00:02:19.300> battery<00:02:19.750> acid<00:02:19.950> shouldn't<00:02:20.950> be

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
water or battery acid shouldn't be

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.590 
water or battery acid shouldn't be
battery<00:02:21.430> acid<00:02:21.520> because<00:02:21.970> this<00:02:22.120> is<00:02:22.270> a<00:02:22.300> gel

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
battery acid because this is a gel

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.840 
battery acid because this is a gel
battery<00:02:22.810> and<00:02:23.530> shouldn't<00:02:23.920> have<00:02:24.190> any<00:02:24.400> liquid<00:02:24.610> in

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
battery and shouldn't have any liquid in

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.040 
battery and shouldn't have any liquid in
it

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
it

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.860 
it
now<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.470> other<00:02:26.710> tums<00:02:27.400> I've<00:02:28.180> just<00:02:28.480> put<00:02:28.660> a<00:02:28.690> bit

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
now the other tums I've just put a bit

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.950 
now the other tums I've just put a bit
of<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:29.050> jiff<00:02:29.940> lemon<00:02:30.940> on<00:02:31.060> it<00:02:31.090> and<00:02:31.360> you<00:02:31.450> can<00:02:31.600> see

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
of the jiff lemon on it and you can see

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.700 
of the jiff lemon on it and you can see
I<00:02:32.260> hope<00:02:32.680> quite<00:02:33.670> clearly<00:02:34.240> that<00:02:35.170> that<00:02:35.230> is

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
I hope quite clearly that that is

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.030 
I hope quite clearly that that is
producing<00:02:36.430> carbon<00:02:37.300> dioxide<00:02:37.740> so<00:02:38.740> we've<00:02:38.860> got<00:02:39.010> a

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
producing carbon dioxide so we've got a

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.700 
producing carbon dioxide so we've got a
reaction<00:02:39.400> between<00:02:39.820> the<00:02:40.300> calcium<00:02:41.110> carbonate

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
reaction between the calcium carbonate

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.890 
reaction between the calcium carbonate
and<00:02:42.070> the<00:02:42.700> citric<00:02:43.030> acid<00:02:43.150> in<00:02:43.450> the<00:02:43.570> lemon<00:02:43.690> juice

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
and the citric acid in the lemon juice

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.200 
and the citric acid in the lemon juice
and<00:02:44.860> that's<00:02:45.010> producing<00:02:45.700> gas<00:02:46.240> that<00:02:46.960> this<00:02:47.260> one

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
and that's producing gas that this one

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
and that's producing gas that this one
it<00:02:49.210> really<00:02:49.630> isn't

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
it really isn't

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.460 
it really isn't
tri<00:02:50.920> gets<00:02:51.130> a<00:02:51.190> message<00:02:51.340> on<00:02:51.640> top<00:02:52.090> of<00:02:52.270> it<00:02:52.440> so<00:02:53.440> I

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
tri gets a message on top of it so I

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.110 
tri gets a message on top of it so I
said<00:02:53.680> acid<00:02:54.010> of<00:02:54.130> course<00:02:54.310> I<00:02:54.520> don't<00:02:54.700> think<00:02:54.910> it<00:02:55.000> is

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
said acid of course I don't think it is

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.530 
said acid of course I don't think it is
acid<00:02:55.540> because<00:02:56.070> there's<00:02:57.070> no<00:02:58.000> apparent

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
acid because there's no apparent

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.380 
acid because there's no apparent
reaction<00:02:59.320> taking<00:02:59.650> place<00:02:59.860> there<00:03:00.520> I<00:03:00.730> mean<00:03:01.210> the

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
reaction taking place there I mean the

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.860 
reaction taking place there I mean the
tablet<00:03:02.350> is<00:03:02.470> starting<00:03:02.860> to<00:03:03.070> disintegrate<00:03:03.870> but

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
tablet is starting to disintegrate but

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.220 
tablet is starting to disintegrate but
it's<00:03:05.050> not<00:03:05.410> fizzing<00:03:05.980> there's<00:03:06.220> no<00:03:06.460> gas<00:03:07.020> this<00:03:08.020> one

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
it's not fizzing there's no gas this one

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.220 
it's not fizzing there's no gas this one
over<00:03:08.470> here<00:03:08.800> is<00:03:09.010> definitely<00:03:10.230> producing

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
over here is definitely producing

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.650 
over here is definitely producing
bubbles<00:03:11.710> of<00:03:11.980> gas<00:03:12.010> and<00:03:13.000> that<00:03:13.150> leads<00:03:13.420> me<00:03:13.570> to

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
bubbles of gas and that leads me to

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.020 
bubbles of gas and that leads me to
believe<00:03:13.840> that<00:03:14.080> this<00:03:14.500> is<00:03:14.680> not<00:03:14.950> battery<00:03:15.910> acid

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
believe that this is not battery acid

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.000 
believe that this is not battery acid
and<00:03:16.420> it<00:03:16.510> shouldn't<00:03:16.750> be<00:03:16.810> battery<00:03:17.200> battery<00:03:17.710> acid

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
and it shouldn't be battery battery acid

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.640 
and it shouldn't be battery battery acid
it's<00:03:18.670> just<00:03:18.880> rainwater<00:03:19.540> that<00:03:19.900> got<00:03:20.170> into<00:03:20.530> this

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
it's just rainwater that got into this

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.310 
it's just rainwater that got into this
thing<00:03:21.060> through<00:03:22.060> that<00:03:22.420> little<00:03:22.630> vent<00:03:23.020> hole

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
thing through that little vent hole

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.470 
thing through that little vent hole
there<00:03:23.650> while<00:03:24.460> it<00:03:24.640> was<00:03:24.760> lying<00:03:25.030> in<00:03:25.300> the<00:03:25.360> street

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
there while it was lying in the street

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.020 
there while it was lying in the street
now<00:03:26.380> to<00:03:26.440> test<00:03:26.920> this<00:03:27.130> I'm<00:03:27.460> actually<00:03:27.670> gonna

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
now to test this I'm actually gonna

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.350 
now to test this I'm actually gonna
taste<00:03:28.450> this<00:03:29.290> liquid<00:03:30.040> and<00:03:30.730> put<00:03:31.030> it<00:03:31.090> on<00:03:31.180> my

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
taste this liquid and put it on my

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.110 
taste this liquid and put it on my
finger<00:03:31.500> I'm<00:03:32.500> not<00:03:32.650> gonna<00:03:32.800> taste<00:03:33.550> too<00:03:33.790> much<00:03:33.970> of

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
finger I'm not gonna taste too much of

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.650 
finger I'm not gonna taste too much of
it<00:03:34.240> so<00:03:34.270> wipe<00:03:35.230> most<00:03:35.620> of<00:03:35.800> it<00:03:35.920> off<00:03:36.100> and<00:03:36.480> I'm<00:03:37.480> gonna

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
it so wipe most of it off and I'm gonna

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:47.000 
it so wipe most of it off and I'm gonna
taste<00:03:38.110> that<00:03:38.440> now<00:03:44.910> yep

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
taste that now yep

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.600 
taste that now yep
that's<00:03:47.970> not<00:03:48.150> battery<00:03:48.330> acid<00:03:49.129> that's<00:03:50.129> water

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
that's not battery acid that's water

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.089 
that's not battery acid that's water
so<00:03:51.239> that's<00:03:52.019> the<00:03:52.170> suit<00:03:52.319> that's<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.680> answer

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
so that's the suit that's the answer

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.430 
so that's the suit that's the answer
rainwater<00:03:53.790> got<00:03:54.420> into<00:03:54.690> this<00:03:54.780> battery<00:03:55.200> it<00:03:55.290> is<00:03:55.319> a

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
rainwater got into this battery it is a

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.970 
rainwater got into this battery it is a
gel<00:03:55.739> battery<00:03:57.110> it's<00:03:58.110> just<00:03:58.290> water<00:03:58.470> in<00:03:58.709> there

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
gel battery it's just water in there

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.140 
gel battery it's just water in there
can't<00:03:59.879> taste<00:04:00.060> anything<00:04:00.709> so<00:04:01.709> that's<00:04:02.040> not<00:04:02.340> acid

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
can't taste anything so that's not acid

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.650 
can't taste anything so that's not acid
and<00:04:03.360> the<00:04:04.010> calcium<00:04:05.010> carbonate<00:04:05.519> test<00:04:05.849> has

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
and the calcium carbonate test has

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.530 
and the calcium carbonate test has
proved<00:04:07.110> that<00:04:07.410> now<00:04:08.250> I've<00:04:08.370> had<00:04:08.519> the<00:04:08.640> solar<00:04:09.120> panel

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
proved that now I've had the solar panel

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.500 
proved that now I've had the solar panel
connected<00:04:10.470> to<00:04:10.560> this<00:04:10.680> for<00:04:11.010> a<00:04:11.310> few<00:04:11.910> moments

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
connected to this for a few moments

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:20.629 
connected to this for a few moments
let's<00:04:12.900> just<00:04:13.230> remove<00:04:13.829> that<00:04:15.440> 21.8<00:04:16.440> volts<00:04:19.639> so

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
let's just remove that 21.8 volts so

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.379 
let's just remove that 21.8 volts so
it's<00:04:20.729> kind<00:04:20.970> of<00:04:22.430> 5<00:04:23.430> volts<00:04:23.850> but<00:04:23.940> it's<00:04:24.090> not<00:04:24.180> really

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
it's kind of 5 volts but it's not really

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.140 
it's kind of 5 volts but it's not really
holding<00:04:24.660> that<00:04:25.199> I<00:04:25.520> don't<00:04:26.520> know<00:04:26.669> I<00:04:26.699> wonder

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
holding that I don't know I wonder

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.850 
holding that I don't know I wonder
whether<00:04:27.300> charging<00:04:27.840> it's<00:04:28.169> worth<00:04:28.410> attempting

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
whether charging it's worth attempting

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.460 
whether charging it's worth attempting
to<00:04:29.250> charge<00:04:29.460> this<00:04:29.729> battery<00:04:29.789> what<00:04:30.750> concerns<00:04:31.260> me

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
to charge this battery what concerns me

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.210 
to charge this battery what concerns me
is<00:04:31.650> this<00:04:31.949> very<00:04:32.690> there's<00:04:33.690> a<00:04:33.810> very<00:04:34.380> low<00:04:34.710> apparent

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
is this very there's a very low apparent

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.090 
is this very there's a very low apparent
resistance<00:04:35.699> of<00:04:35.910> the<00:04:36.030> battery<00:04:36.949> because<00:04:37.949> when

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
resistance of the battery because when

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.290 
resistance of the battery because when
you<00:04:38.190> put<00:04:38.370> the<00:04:38.430> solar<00:04:38.639> panel<00:04:38.760> on<00:04:39.000> it<00:04:39.150> goes

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
you put the solar panel on it goes

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.909 
you put the solar panel on it goes
straight<00:04:39.630> up<00:04:39.690> to<00:04:40.310> 21<00:04:41.310> volts<00:04:41.789> so<00:04:42.750> I<00:04:43.289> don't<00:04:43.800> know

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
straight up to 21 volts so I don't know

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.830 
straight up to 21 volts so I don't know
I<00:04:44.160> mean<00:04:44.520> just<00:04:44.669> as<00:04:44.789> an<00:04:44.910> experiment<00:04:45.479> it<00:04:45.570> might<00:04:45.720> be

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
I mean just as an experiment it might be

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.719 
I mean just as an experiment it might be
worth<00:04:46.020> leaving<00:04:46.770> it<00:04:47.010> on<00:04:47.100> there<00:04:47.340> for<00:04:47.460> a<00:04:47.550> while

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
worth leaving it on there for a while

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:50.629 
worth leaving it on there for a while
perhaps<00:04:48.300> I<00:04:48.419> will<00:04:48.680> and<00:04:49.680> I<00:04:49.830> should<00:04:50.039> probably<00:04:50.130> add

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
perhaps I will and I should probably add

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:53.990 
perhaps I will and I should probably add
a<00:04:50.669> little<00:04:51.060> disclaimer<00:04:52.070> don't<00:04:53.070> put<00:04:53.490> unknown

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
a little disclaimer don't put unknown

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.480 
a little disclaimer don't put unknown
liquids<00:04:54.450> in<00:04:54.690> your<00:04:54.870> mouth<00:04:55.139> even<00:04:55.470> if<00:04:56.190> they

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
liquids in your mouth even if they

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.540 
liquids in your mouth even if they
appear<00:04:57.150> not<00:04:57.479> to<00:04:57.780> be<00:04:57.930> acid<00:04:58.440> and<00:04:58.950> certainly<00:04:59.340> that

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
appear not to be acid and certainly that

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.900 
appear not to be acid and certainly that
one<00:04:59.729> is<00:05:00.240> not<00:05:00.450> acid<00:05:01.220> don't<00:05:02.220> do<00:05:02.370> this<00:05:02.520> at<00:05:02.700> home

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
one is not acid don't do this at home

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.220 
one is not acid don't do this at home
folks<00:05:03.270> not<00:05:03.930> very<00:05:04.169> sensible<00:05:04.770> really
