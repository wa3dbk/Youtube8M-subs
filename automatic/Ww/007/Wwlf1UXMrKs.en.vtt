many<00:00:27.480> places<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:28.260> land<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.920> Jupiter's

when<00:01:41.230> you're<00:01:41.380> using<00:01:41.590> your<00:01:41.830> thrusters<00:01:42.370> to<00:01:42.610> land

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
when you're using your thrusters to land

when you're using your thrusters to land
your<00:01:43.120> spacecraft<00:01:44.040> hang<00:01:45.040> on<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:49.240> gets<00:01:49.450> tiring

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
your spacecraft hang on that gets tiring

after<00:01:49.840> a<00:01:50.170> while<00:01:50.550> here<00:01:51.550> here's<00:01:51.730> a<00:01:51.820> trick

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
after a while here here's a trick

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.970 
after a while here here's a trick
question<00:01:52.150> since<00:01:52.720> you<00:01:52.930> know<00:01:53.080> you<00:01:53.140> cannot<00:01:53.650> hear

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 
question since you know you cannot hear

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.620 
question since you know you cannot hear
sound<00:01:54.310> in<00:01:54.520> space<00:01:54.550> because<00:01:55.090> there's<00:01:55.450> no

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
sound in space because there's no

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.380 
sound in space because there's no
atmosphere<00:01:55.810> can<00:01:56.470> you<00:01:56.560> hear<00:01:56.860> sound<00:01:57.220> on<00:01:57.460> Jupiter

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
atmosphere can you hear sound on Jupiter

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.690 
atmosphere can you hear sound on Jupiter
the<00:01:59.290> answer<00:01:59.530> is<00:01:59.560> no<00:01:59.830> because<00:02:00.010> you'd<00:02:00.340> be<00:02:00.460> dead

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
the answer is no because you'd be dead

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.660 
the answer is no because you'd be dead
before<00:02:00.910> you<00:02:01.210> heard<00:02:01.390> anything<00:02:02.460> let's<00:02:03.460> talk

about<00:02:03.790> controls<00:02:04.300> using<00:02:04.540> the<00:02:04.840> keyboard<00:02:05.110> or

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
about controls using the keyboard or

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.430 
about controls using the keyboard or
joystick<00:02:06.040> you<00:02:06.910> can<00:02:07.090> thrust<00:02:07.360> left<00:02:07.780> and<00:02:08.050> right

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
joystick you can thrust left and right

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.040 
joystick you can thrust left and right
