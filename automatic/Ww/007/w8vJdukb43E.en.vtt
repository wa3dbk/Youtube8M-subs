00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.220
 if you have rich games of scandal create that atmosphere the 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.760
 Developers proved for the first time with Systemic 2 and the last one 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:14.769
 sometimes with Bioshock and 8 o'clock Live bloom the atmosphere of Bioshock Infinite is likely 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.220
 Be as dense as out of millions 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.849
 in the case of problems with comprehension, simply look for the boy on the Internet or 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:21.840
 assume 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.000
 that the atmosphere of Bioshock Infinite may have been quite so far maybe 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.730
 but it should be totally important 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.730
 Master Eckart 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.010
 responsible for this is again the people complements the typical 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.050
 Mix of unusual action 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.079
 in unusual notes with unusual appearance and 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.559
 unusual game mechanics where you have to admit that we have many elements 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.230
 by Bioshock Infinite already from the underwater predecessor Bioshock 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.900
 or at branched 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.330
 such as that the hero with the right hand a weapon and with the left 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.420
 Hand can perform magic 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.740
 or whatever he likes to call fast in Bioshock Infinite 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.080
 let in how much 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.190
 new no that is, however, the freedom of movement in flames like a 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.720
 Comparison to the one in the underwater city Rapture 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.160
 the hack respondents in themselves with a hook 1 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.180
 this team of publishers appeared 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.760
 and so quickly come from a to b 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.760
 stupid only that the opponents can do the same but just stop Boka and School 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.620
 Amia 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.610
 we just fit together what Bioshock Infinite is all about 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.200
 In 1912, the former Pinkerton Agent Cup is bringing the boy 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.920
 Tracking down Elizabeth in the flying city of Cocoon Lamia 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.010
 However, it is no longer cool that Utja is more than Utopia 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.660
 but a madness and civil war plunged it flying 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.390
 remained full of dangers for clear parallels with the first Bavaria fort without 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.480
 however larger companies 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.190
 In addition, there were in Bioshock 1 shows Kate or rescue someone 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.130
 the petite in this world is in Bioshock Infinite but not only too 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.880
 free the victim but also weapons terrain secret as well 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.880
 Sympathizer and not always locked 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.370
 It may be called a list or in the English original Thierry Salvi 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:10.819
 Open the past 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.969
 for almost 70 at the request of Boccaccio club long gone 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:17.969
 car interior 

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:25.149
 that costs prospective buyers and if so shortly after a former 

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:28.220
 stationary rocket launching things are needed now 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.610
 then maybe Elizabeth will say that she is too weak for it 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:32.929
 check 

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:36.710
 but Elizabeth as helpful as she can be with her magic 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.480
 is someone the trucker on the war brings their situation 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.520
 for example, when the buses are suddenly unintentionally a deer in the for the 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.519
 two completely confusing future 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:55.639
 and besides, it's about liberating the young woman 

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:59.259
 that can not be done without corresponding resistance or the resulting 

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:02.259
 resulting problems is only logical 

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:04.349
 It should really be over 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.430
 a gigantic mechanical bird will have named 

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:10.759
 the leadership learned from mistakes 

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:15.129
 The Book of the Finest Action united and probably will not stay 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:16.179
 once 

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:20.939
 how the story about Boka and Elizabeth starts out in the 2 and which ones 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:24.399
 Surprises and less quick ideas and in the course of the story 

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:27.759
 but we do not expect that until 2012 

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:32.149
 and that's barred at such a promising title 6 4 

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:33.290
 Player shudders 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.189
 celebrated a silent long day 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:39.189
 HEK 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.819
 Axway 

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:44.769
 I was
