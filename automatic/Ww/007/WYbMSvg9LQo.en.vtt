00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 fifth stage of the grand prix start the season 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:07.350
 finished in bordeaux so now 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.540
 detailed story about him Maxim Kovtun 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.340
 really pleased everyone 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.139
 fans and yes and even I think 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.460
 detractors are not with everyone 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.220
 the day is getting less and less he 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.140
 was after a short sixth it turned out that 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.359
 no chance to get close 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.430
 closer but he did practically 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.960
 incredible he's not even the third saloon 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.760
 second he skated his random 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.890
 programs so cool did two 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.080
 quadruple and in the end he won 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.090
 french stage this season and 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.910
 means after two wins Maxim Kovtun 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.340
 picks up maximum points 30 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.530
 and he will be one hundred percent grand prix final 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.840
 this season there will be Elena 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.910
 radion also two wins it was 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.219
 the second stage and her this season she 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.350
 refused brilliantly in arbitrary 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.239
 program and retained its first place 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.149
 which she had conquered back in 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.820
 a short amount of Lena Rodionic 200 3 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.620
 points and 92 comb is very good 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.969
 the result and the main thing that is very good 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.190
 quality skating 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.409
 Elena demonstrated and she is in it 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.780
 season look incredibly stable well 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.130
 almost as stable and good 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:14.880
 as last season was Julia Lipnitskaya 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.799
 it's hard to start this season after those 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.810
 the incredible success she achieved 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.369
 last year there is mouth of course this 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.470
 psychological longtime Olympiad and 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.619
 world championships and the title of national team leader 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:29.040
 It is such a heavy pressure but Julia 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.570
 well done and she is not very good so 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.579
 Well skated arbitrarily program 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.869
 there were small mistakes in the end of yulia 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.299
 Lipnitskoy in second place 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.460
 two second places at Julia and it means that she 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.409
 will also perform in the grand prix finals and 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.170
 pleased especially pleased in my 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.600
 colleague 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.479
 vasyukova is not everything for me but pillar and fedor 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.700
 Klimov live not really liked 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.130
 because Ksyusha watched skated 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.830
 excellent if Moscow was great 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.229
 then it turned out even brighter in bordeaux and 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.299
 end up after arbitrary programs they don't 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.490
 only saved but still increased their 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:03.310
 separation from the Chinese duo and 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.680
 also two wins Xenia Fedor pillars 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.250
 Klima this year they also selected 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:12.660
 grand prix finals and itâ€™s very good of you 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.660
