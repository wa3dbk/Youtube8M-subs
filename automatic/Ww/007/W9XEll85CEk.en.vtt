that keeps user data is if you are
currently<00:01:46.270> on<00:01:46.570> the<00:01:46.600> FK<00:01:47.140> 09<00:01:47.590> build<00:01:47.860> you<00:01:48.040> might

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.370 
currently on the FK 09 build you might

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.520 
currently on the FK 09 build you might
be<00:01:48.790> able<00:01:48.909> to<00:01:49.060> use<00:01:49.150> the<00:01:49.450> keeps<00:01:49.690> user<00:01:49.960> data<00:01:50.260> one

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
be able to use the keeps user data one

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.980 
be able to use the keeps user data one
otherwise<00:01:51.400> my<00:01:51.730> personal<00:01:52.240> recommendation<00:01:52.330> is

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
otherwise my personal recommendation is

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.350 
otherwise my personal recommendation is
to<00:01:53.020> use<00:01:53.260> the<00:01:53.409> reset<00:01:53.770> user<00:01:53.920> data<00:01:54.250> option<00:01:54.760> again

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
to use the reset user data option again

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.240 
to use the reset user data option again
I<00:01:55.570> believe<00:01:56.050> both<00:01:56.290> of<00:01:56.530> them<00:01:56.680> will<00:01:56.920> wipe

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
I believe both of them will wipe

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.880 
I believe both of them will wipe
internal<00:01:57.850> storage<00:01:58.300> so<00:01:59.260> just<00:01:59.530> kind<00:01:59.680> of<00:01:59.710> keep

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
internal storage so just kind of keep

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.100 
internal storage so just kind of keep
that<00:02:00.010> in<00:02:00.100> mind<00:02:00.250> but<00:02:00.460> anyways<00:02:00.880> now<00:02:01.270> click<00:02:01.930> and
