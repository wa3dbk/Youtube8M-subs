00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.920
 in the intersection there in the second half 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.600

 so we have these laws with 2 0 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.700
 our tenth victory has already been won 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.920

 turn taps kindle encourage 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.860
 the first game against this team yes 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.930
 that looks not really help 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.810
 so it must be a typical one 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.430
 the zlatan ibrahimovic and that is you 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.890

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.120
 dude natural already crypt and so 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.860
 we think this was the weather is later 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.119
 made with two goals of course 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.119
 Your laundry is tasty 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.670
 kate following that hard to come across is this 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.640
 years pretty good silver team it 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.549
 say that formula cassette d holy shit 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.900
 why so good that I really was 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:31.360
 dramatic cam show you very quickly in the 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.150
 match thea are falling behind by this 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.060
 kind of nonsense why do I get one here 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.549
 penalty for against I hit him budget 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.409
 not my eyes correlation penalty and such 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.909
 we are one behind zero 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:44.470
 and in the second half he runs on one 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:46.090
 new way second chance of the 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.829
 match and scored 2 0 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.599
 happy in some vague way and 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:51.640
 I with everyone alongside Lucas 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.530
 I piss that ball the choir but yes we 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.209
 losing the two unfortunately and therefore 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.829
 got our second loses and must 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.840
 be careful not to go the third time 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:01.209
 lose because yes we must be natural 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.549
 play that reason but this team saw 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.709
 also really choose in c and f with cult 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.560
 my ribs in it and some others 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.569
 good French players but yes you know it 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.700
 it can go in any direction 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.530
 but this time it went fucking again 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.269
 wrong way how we here too 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.470
 ball gets at queens man it is 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.239
 unbelievable 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.910
 but luckily with now cupboard it heads through 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.459
 save to ibrahimovic who fortunately the 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.560
 hema but the unfortunately did not last long 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.609
 may enjoy because crise man runs 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.230
 just total 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:31.150
 but also total but defense out 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.480
 and shoot the ball into it 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.220
 yes it's really just dramatic why 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.260
 you just go wrong again 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.639
 visually two and we have to play 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.500
 downgrade 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:43.569
 because we like April 10 from the last time 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.669
 Lastly the upgraded must also have him unfortunately 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.099
 again a speech and yes that is one 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:50.799
 little bags but we just now and 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:52.900
 ran a player put the ring i go i go 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:55.299
 I just think when I win 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.299
 may i or two for our players in it 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:00.280
 team set the league or me 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:02.349
 may just play a golden one but that 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.150
 may you be certain of course 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.489
 bit to get that 100 team spirit because 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.530
 so it really does not get along with the 60 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.879
 team spirit that I have I can just be there 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.680
 do not win competitions it is 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:13.090
 just almost impossible 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.859
 so we must is mine of good bronze 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.519
 team buildings and we'll see later 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:16.780
 further 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.880
 our next match is against this 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.039
 year pittsburgh on the dramatic with 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.199
 a cm in the middle of all in the 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:25.150
 defenses ca and we on right back and 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:25.870
 a right back in the rush it is real 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.550
 unbelievable 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.070
 I think you totally understand this guy 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.630
 none of that with that 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.580
 but yes if later not curious something 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.260
 briefly in the third minute always zero 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.480
 and then I actually knew all of these 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.470
 competition is almost won 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.280
 actually knows it quite well 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.810
 difficult pot 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.790
 only then in the second half did I score 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.110
 out of the cords and then it went 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.820
 actually beats easily then 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.830
 makes the three zero here and not much 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.800
 later gives beats a nice show 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.300
 article on terms of repeated back ah I know 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.220
 no longer one of those two 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.780
 forefront players happen to me there 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.740
 this once moment i don't know what me 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.450
 defend d 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.890
 but he also made eric feel more 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.330
 guys this was the episode late here 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.790
 in the comments behind what you find 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.050
 from that bronze idea that if I win 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.790
 that I still have two bronze space 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.590
 upgrade or play a gold 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.940
 So of course you decide this 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.160
 It was then I did not like to give 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.970
 a thumb up and subscribe below and below 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.970
