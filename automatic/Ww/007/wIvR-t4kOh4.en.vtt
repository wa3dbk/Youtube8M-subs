Focus<00:00:07.550> so<00:00:08.550> first<00:00:09.210> thing<00:00:09.510> obviously<00:00:09.900> is<00:00:10.260> to<00:00:10.530> get

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
Focus so first thing obviously is to get

Focus so first thing obviously is to get
the<00:00:11.599> car<00:00:12.599> jacked<00:00:12.929> up<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:13.320> take<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.590> wheel<00:00:13.620> off

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:14.120 
the car jacked up and take the wheel off

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.529 
the car jacked up and take the wheel off
then<00:00:15.890> bolts<00:00:16.890> on<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.190> back<00:00:17.310> of<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.609> caliper

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
then bolts on the back of the caliper

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.200 
then bolts on the back of the caliper
are<00:00:19.039> t4<00:00:20.039> t5<00:00:20.570> Torx<00:00:21.570> socket<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:23.210> there's

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
are t4 t5 Torx socket and there's

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.450 
are t4 t5 Torx socket and there's
usually<00:00:24.510> some<00:00:24.960> little<00:00:25.230> plastic<00:00:25.680> clips<00:00:26.130> on<00:00:26.369> the

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
usually some little plastic clips on the

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.490 
usually some little plastic clips on the
back<00:00:26.609> protect<00:00:27.269> those<00:00:27.480> they're<00:00:27.960> missing<00:00:28.380> on

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
back protect those they're missing on

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:36.500 
back protect those they're missing on
mine<00:00:28.710> just<00:00:29.490> go<00:00:29.849> ahead<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.710> get<00:00:31.710> those<00:00:31.890> off<00:00:35.510> and

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
mine just go ahead and get those off and

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.209 
mine just go ahead and get those off and
when<00:00:36.630> those<00:00:36.780> are<00:00:37.020> all<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.649> way<00:00:37.739> loose<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.160> can

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
when those are all the way loose you can

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.470 
when those are all the way loose you can
take<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.870> screwdriver<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:41.180> first<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.329> have<00:00:42.420> to

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
take a screwdriver and first you have to

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.279 
take a screwdriver and first you have to
get<00:00:42.690> this<00:00:42.840> clip<00:00:43.469> off<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:43.950> out<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.250> way<00:00:46.100> and

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:48.289 
get this clip off and out of the way and

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:51.979 
get this clip off and out of the way and
then<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.620> can<00:00:50.149> start<00:00:51.149> prying<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.570> caliper

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
then you can start prying the caliper

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.880 
then you can start prying the caliper
off<00:00:54.110> you<00:00:55.110> never<00:00:55.350> want<00:00:55.649> let<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.370> caliper<00:00:57.890> hang

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
off you never want let the caliper hang

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.760 
off you never want let the caliper hang
by<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.219> Flex<00:00:59.640> line<00:00:59.910> or<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.600> can<00:01:00.780> ruin<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.140> but

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
by the Flex line or you can ruin it but

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.520 
by the Flex line or you can ruin it but
once<00:01:02.010> that's<00:01:02.219> off<00:01:02.960> there's<00:01:03.960> nothing<00:01:04.409> else

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
once that's off there's nothing else

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.480 
once that's off there's nothing else
holding<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.159> rotor<00:01:05.339> on<00:01:06.890> you<00:01:07.890> just<00:01:08.130> take<00:01:08.340> that

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
holding the rotor on you just take that

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:15.240 
holding the rotor on you just take that
off

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:22.840 

and<00:01:16.479> the<00:01:17.479> front<00:01:17.780> pad<00:01:18.049> then<00:01:18.890> you<00:01:19.130> have<00:01:19.400> to<00:01:21.850> take

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
and the front pad then you have to take

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:30.690 
and the front pad then you have to take
that<00:01:23.590> clip<00:01:24.590> off<00:01:24.799> from<00:01:25.100> the<00:01:25.189> caliper

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.630 

then<00:01:31.700> you<00:01:32.030> can<00:01:32.240> get<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:32.810> pad<00:01:33.049> out<00:01:33.350> some<00:01:34.340> prying

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
then you can get the pad out some prying

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.520 
then you can get the pad out some prying
with<00:01:34.789> the<00:01:34.880> screwdriver<00:01:35.119> and<00:01:35.570> then<00:01:36.170> the<00:01:36.350> back

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
with the screwdriver and then the back

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:52.120 
with the screwdriver and then the back
pad<00:01:36.860> just<00:01:38.110> pulse<00:01:41.020> straight<00:01:42.020> out<00:01:42.200> with<00:01:51.130> the

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
pad just pulse straight out with the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.840 
pad just pulse straight out with the
pads<00:01:52.520> out<00:01:52.759> you're<00:01:53.030> going<00:01:53.179> to<00:01:53.240> need<00:01:53.479> to<00:01:53.689> push

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
pads out you're going to need to push

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.240 
pads out you're going to need to push
piston<00:01:55.850> back<00:01:56.000> in<00:01:56.270> now<00:01:57.200> use<00:01:57.350> a<00:01:57.380> seat<00:01:57.770> clamp<00:01:58.009> for

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
piston back in now use a seat clamp for

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.960 
piston back in now use a seat clamp for
that<00:01:58.420> but<00:01:59.420> first<00:02:00.009> you<00:02:01.009> need<00:02:01.189> to<00:02:01.219> take<00:02:01.580> the<00:02:01.759> top

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
that but first you need to take the top

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.429 
that but first you need to take the top
off<00:02:02.240> of<00:02:02.330> the<00:02:03.200> master<00:02:03.380> cylinder<00:02:05.049> and<00:02:06.049> this<00:02:06.200> is

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
off of the master cylinder and this is

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:10.300 
off of the master cylinder and this is
it<00:02:06.619> you<00:02:06.799> just<00:02:07.039> unscrew<00:02:07.369> it<00:02:07.789> and<00:02:09.069> pull<00:02:10.069> that<00:02:10.250> up

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
it you just unscrew it and pull that up

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.750 
it you just unscrew it and pull that up
and<00:02:11.860> that's<00:02:12.860> where<00:02:13.099> you<00:02:13.190> add<00:02:13.340> your<00:02:13.370> brake

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
and that's where you add your brake

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.620 
and that's where you add your brake
fluid<00:02:14.440> so<00:02:15.440> if<00:02:15.530> you<00:02:15.829> leave<00:02:16.549> that<00:02:16.610> on<00:02:17.000> and<00:02:17.269> you

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
fluid so if you leave that on and you

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.460 
fluid so if you leave that on and you
just<00:02:17.930> put<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.590> Cal<00:02:19.360> C<00:02:20.360> clamp<00:02:20.660> on<00:02:20.870> and<00:02:21.110> start

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
just put the Cal C clamp on and start

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.520 
just put the Cal C clamp on and start
cranking<00:02:21.890> it<00:02:22.010> down<00:02:22.750> well<00:02:23.750> one<00:02:23.959> it's<00:02:24.170> really

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
cranking it down well one it's really

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.430 
cranking it down well one it's really
hard<00:02:24.890> and<00:02:25.329> if<00:02:26.329> you<00:02:26.510> just<00:02:26.750> keep<00:02:26.959> going<00:02:27.140> at<00:02:27.410> it

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
hard and if you just keep going at it

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.229 
hard and if you just keep going at it
you<00:02:27.590> could<00:02:27.829> burst<00:02:28.069> a<00:02:28.340> brake<00:02:28.760> line

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
you could burst a brake line

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.440 
you could burst a brake line
I<00:02:30.099> just<00:02:31.099> set<00:02:31.340> it<00:02:31.489> in<00:02:31.549> there<00:02:31.730> like<00:02:31.940> that<00:02:32.209> and

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
I just set it in there like that and

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.309 
I just set it in there like that and
it's<00:02:33.230> real<00:02:33.680> easy<00:02:33.709> just<00:02:34.010> one-handed<00:02:34.819> and<00:02:35.319> very

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
it's real easy just one-handed and very

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.050 
it's real easy just one-handed and very
slowly<00:02:37.100> turn<00:02:37.579> it<00:02:39.040> and<00:02:40.040> you<00:02:40.220> can<00:02:40.459> see<00:02:40.819> the

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
slowly turn it and you can see the

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:53.210 
slowly turn it and you can see the
piston<00:02:42.280> gets<00:02:43.280> pushed<00:02:43.489> back<00:02:43.670> in

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.260 

and<00:02:54.220> when<00:02:54.520> there's<00:02:54.700> a<00:02:54.760> little<00:02:54.940> bit<00:02:55.150> of

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
and when there's a little bit of

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:05.220 
and when there's a little bit of
resistance<00:02:55.830> it's<00:02:56.830> all<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.160> way<00:02:57.280> in<00:03:04.050> the<00:03:05.050> new

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
resistance it's all the way in the new

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.480 
resistance it's all the way in the new
pad<00:03:05.530> just<00:03:06.660> sits<00:03:07.660> in<00:03:07.810> here<00:03:08.110> and<00:03:08.230> pushes<00:03:08.980> in<00:03:09.190> this

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
pad just sits in here and pushes in this

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.530 
pad just sits in here and pushes in this
way<00:03:09.700> and<00:03:11.400> require<00:03:12.400> some<00:03:12.730> wiggling<00:03:13.450> around

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
way and require some wiggling around

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.300 
way and require some wiggling around
definitely<00:03:14.410> two-handed<00:03:15.250> and<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:16.180> new<00:03:16.330> pad

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
definitely two-handed and the new pad

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.920 
definitely two-handed and the new pad
other<00:03:18.310> one<00:03:20.460> gets<00:03:21.460> pushed<00:03:21.880> straight<00:03:22.480> down<00:03:22.720> on

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
other one gets pushed straight down on

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.540 
other one gets pushed straight down on
there<00:03:23.140> and<00:03:23.550> this<00:03:24.550> part<00:03:24.910> of<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:26.250> little<00:03:27.250> clip

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
there and this part of the little clip

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.150 
there and this part of the little clip
sits<00:03:28.060> up<00:03:28.240> in<00:03:28.390> there<00:03:28.570> and<00:03:28.780> this<00:03:29.140> side<00:03:29.440> comes

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
sits up in there and this side comes

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.650 
sits up in there and this side comes
tucked<00:03:31.000> around<00:03:31.150> up<00:03:31.480> underneath<00:03:31.960> there<00:03:33.660> then

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
tucked around up underneath there then

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.760 
tucked around up underneath there then
you<00:03:34.840> just<00:03:35.140> put<00:03:35.380> the<00:03:35.410> rotor<00:03:35.680> on<00:03:35.950> and<00:03:37.620> take<00:03:38.620> the

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
you just put the rotor on and take the

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.130 
you just put the rotor on and take the
caliper<00:03:39.370> and<00:03:39.400> put<00:03:39.760> it<00:03:39.880> in<00:03:40.030> this<00:03:40.180> way<00:03:40.420> there's

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
caliper and put it in this way there's

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:48.660 
caliper and put it in this way there's
little<00:03:43.140> groove<00:03:44.140> in<00:03:44.410> the<00:03:46.230> tabs<00:03:47.230> for<00:03:47.560> the<00:03:47.670> brake

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
little groove in the tabs for the brake

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.470 
little groove in the tabs for the brake
pads<00:03:48.970> that<00:03:49.330> line<00:03:49.570> up<00:03:49.720> in<00:03:49.840> there<00:03:50.020> and<00:03:51.270> line<00:03:52.270> up

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
pads that line up in there and line up

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.080 
pads that line up in there and line up
the<00:03:52.600> holes<00:03:52.810> for<00:03:53.140> your<00:03:53.320> bolts<00:03:54.220> and<00:03:54.460> tighten

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
the holes for your bolts and tighten

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.870 
the holes for your bolts and tighten
those<00:03:55.330> back<00:03:55.600> down<00:03:56.220> and<00:03:57.900> then<00:03:58.900> this<00:03:59.490> clip<00:04:00.490> once

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
those back down and then this clip once

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.820 
those back down and then this clip once
it's<00:04:01.060> on<00:04:01.209> it's<00:04:01.420> easier<00:04:01.870> to<00:04:02.110> move<00:04:02.530> it<00:04:02.709> out<00:04:02.800> of

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
it's on it's easier to move it out of

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.740 
it's on it's easier to move it out of
the<00:04:03.010> way<00:04:03.130> like<00:04:03.340> this<00:04:03.580> to<00:04:03.730> get<00:04:03.850> the<00:04:03.910> caliper<00:04:04.540> or

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
the way like this to get the caliper or

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.949 
the way like this to get the caliper or
the<00:04:05.470> pad<00:04:05.860> onto<00:04:06.130> the<00:04:06.310> caliper<00:04:06.790> and<00:04:07.000> it<00:04:07.600> needs<00:04:07.810> to

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
the pad onto the caliper and it needs to

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:13.380 
the pad onto the caliper and it needs to
be<00:04:08.940> pushed<00:04:09.940> around<00:04:10.150> that<00:04:10.510> way<00:04:10.740> this<00:04:11.740> side<00:04:12.390> like

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
be pushed around that way this side like

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.680 
be pushed around that way this side like
that<00:04:13.630> one<00:04:13.810> goes<00:04:14.160> behind<00:04:15.160> this<00:04:15.520> clip<00:04:15.850> that<00:04:16.540> one

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
that one goes behind this clip that one

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.500 
that one goes behind this clip that one
there<00:04:16.870> as<00:04:16.989> well<00:04:17.170> and<00:04:17.410> then<00:04:17.950> this<00:04:18.640> side<00:04:18.970> has<00:04:19.299> to

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
there as well and then this side has to

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.430 
there as well and then this side has to
get<00:04:19.660> tucked<00:04:19.959> up<00:04:20.230> behind<00:04:21.130> here<00:04:21.520> and<00:04:22.170> prying<00:04:23.170> at

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
get tucked up behind here and prying at

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.720 
get tucked up behind here and prying at
it<00:04:23.560> with<00:04:23.740> a<00:04:23.770> couple<00:04:24.160> of<00:04:24.250> flat<00:04:24.520> blade

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
it with a couple of flat blade

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.900 
it with a couple of flat blade
screwdrivers<00:04:25.480> is<00:04:25.720> the<00:04:26.250> easiest<00:04:27.250> way<00:04:27.490> to<00:04:27.520> do<00:04:27.790> it

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
screwdrivers is the easiest way to do it

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.390 
screwdrivers is the easiest way to do it
and<00:04:28.110> once<00:04:29.110> you've<00:04:29.290> wrestled<00:04:29.770> around<00:04:30.250> with

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
and once you've wrestled around with

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.460 
and once you've wrestled around with
that<00:04:30.520> clip<00:04:30.940> a<00:04:31.060> bit<00:04:31.270> it's<00:04:31.810> not<00:04:31.990> the<00:04:32.170> easiest

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
that clip a bit it's not the easiest

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.890 
that clip a bit it's not the easiest
thing<00:04:32.680> to<00:04:33.070> get<00:04:33.880> pushed<00:04:34.180> around<00:04:34.390> there<00:04:34.690> but

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
thing to get pushed around there but

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.470 
thing to get pushed around there but
that<00:04:35.110> is<00:04:35.140> exactly<00:04:35.790> what<00:04:36.790> it's<00:04:36.970> supposed<00:04:37.030> to

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
that is exactly what it's supposed to

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.160 
that is exactly what it's supposed to
look<00:04:37.570> like

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.170 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:47.180 

then<00:04:42.010> just<00:04:42.570> put<00:04:43.570> the<00:04:43.690> top<00:04:43.900> back<00:04:45.570> on<00:04:46.570> your

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
then just put the top back on your

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.320 
then just put the top back on your
master<00:04:48.190> cylinder<00:04:48.640> and<00:04:49.380> make<00:04:50.380> sure<00:04:50.650> you<00:04:51.150> go<00:04:52.150> in

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
master cylinder and make sure you go in

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.050 
master cylinder and make sure you go in
your<00:04:52.480> car<00:04:52.690> and<00:04:52.810> press<00:04:53.080> on<00:04:53.260> the<00:04:53.380> brake<00:04:53.590> pedal

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
bitch and close this up otherwise if you

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.080 
bitch and close this up otherwise if you
just<00:05:01.870> throw<00:05:02.200> the<00:05:02.290> tire<00:05:02.500> on<00:05:02.740> and<00:05:03.010> try<00:05:03.820> to<00:05:03.850> go

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
just throw the tire on and try to go

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.880 
just throw the tire on and try to go

somewhere you'll press on your brake
it'll<00:05:06.550> go<00:05:06.700> to<00:05:06.760> the<00:05:07.030> floor<00:05:07.330> and<00:05:07.570> your<00:05:07.960> caliper

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
it'll go to the floor and your caliper

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.670 
it'll go to the floor and your caliper
will<00:05:09.150> squeeze<00:05:10.150> in<00:05:10.330> only<00:05:10.660> so<00:05:10.870> much<00:05:11.050> but<00:05:11.320> not<00:05:11.470> all

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
will squeeze in only so much but not all

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.930 
will squeeze in only so much but not all
the<00:05:11.800> way<00:05:11.920> you<00:05:12.460> have<00:05:12.580> to<00:05:12.730> pump<00:05:12.910> it<00:05:13.060> a<00:05:13.120> few<00:05:13.360> times
