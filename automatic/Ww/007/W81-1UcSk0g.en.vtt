00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.750
 size what could be a better template 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.670
 for pop culture allusions in world of 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.900
 warcraft be the lord of the rings of 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.179
 jrr tolkien 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.920
 we are looking for obvious ones this time 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.049
 and maybe not so outlandish 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.890
 allusions to the fantastic empire 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.140
 middle earth 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.760
 but let's go ahead 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.150
 First of all the gentleman over there to words 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.400
 come 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.609
 So I have an idea for one 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.529
 great movie it's about two comedy one 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.269
 bangle find the power and in the 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.040
 Throw burning rods into the kettle 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.130
 the two must form the 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.840
 Brotherhood of the attack on the way 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.239
 Meet a murderer called Grotten 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.800
 who is obsessed with the incentive and nine 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.930
 poor mature monster 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.390
 you could do a three piece with the 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.940
 make the title of lord of the arm out of it 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.850
 The first could be the armlet fellows 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.620
 the second of the towers 2 and the 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:01:03.840
 crowning statements bright is king 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:06.960
 again there is the brotherhood on the rice 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.430
 oh god so natural is this 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.409
 joke of male people player 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.659
 Heroes are the most obvious ones 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.130
 allusions to the Lord of the rings and 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.140
 it gives us a hint on one 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.850
 other similarity namely on the 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.369
 burning steppe and the scorching 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.549
 canyon in the eastern kingdoms 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:25.950
 So get out with mordor like mordor are the 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.960
 regions in wow of high mountains against 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.210
 although the country in and of itself 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.659
 relatively flat is there live 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.340
 coincidentally also a few orcs and 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.770
 a particularly threatening mood 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.780
 is over the land 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.880
 really accessible via wide roads 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.460
 is neither an escape nor a stick you have to 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.899
 already through small trails 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.310
 if you do not move, of course 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.310
 just just fly in 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.860
 The scorching gorge itself reminds 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.680
 on top of that, even a little bit on that 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.680
 let him do the thing while digging 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.660
 and how should it be otherwise 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.789
 There is also a huge towering over everything 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.650
 volcano in middle earth is that of 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.880
 fateful mountain and in world of warcraft 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.880
 is that the black one 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.200
 the black face more exactly the black 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.540
 rock deep becomes yet another 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.880
 similarity in the deep 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.890
 hidden there is a huge in the lyzeum 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.810
 column hall at the moria one of the 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.330
 rich reminds the dwarfs in middle-earth 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.069

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.190
 companions by abandoned and by orks 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.239
 contaminated corridors in the museum of wow can 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.040
 you look at it as it maybe 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.040
 once looked once 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.670
 to understand this allusion must 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.710

 especially exciting in English hot 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.900

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.650
 allusion may be a bit far 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.480
 fetched but quite plausible 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.420
 prophet williams saying is in 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.430

 a ring not so good for others 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.900
 and only he can be angling 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.270
 note that goll around the ring in the 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.500
 river has found land in the ghosts 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.270

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.410
 Do not play with the game 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.060
 puncture middle ground and for a quest 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.890
