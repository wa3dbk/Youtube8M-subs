like<00:00:42.540> that's<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.840> lot<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.200> choose<00:00:43.470> from<00:00:43.500> do<00:00:43.890> you

like that's a lot to choose from do you

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.470 
like that's a lot to choose from do you
think<00:00:44.100> it's<00:00:44.190> gonna<00:00:44.310> be<00:00:44.490> too<00:00:44.640> confusing<00:00:45.150> for

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
think it's gonna be too confusing for

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.660 
think it's gonna be too confusing for
people<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.960> think<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:46.710> once<00:00:46.950> people<00:00:47.100> are<00:00:47.310> able

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
people I think that once people are able

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.660 
people I think that once people are able
to<00:00:47.850> identify<00:00:48.450> which<00:00:48.810> pyramid<00:00:49.470> fits<00:00:49.830> their

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
to identify which pyramid fits their

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.700 
to identify which pyramid fits their
needs<00:00:50.700> it's<00:00:51.360> gonna<00:00:51.570> be<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.780> lot<00:00:52.080> better<00:00:52.320> for

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
needs it's gonna be a lot better for

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.890 
needs it's gonna be a lot better for
everybody<00:00:53.010> because<00:00:53.430> what<00:00:54.210> happened<00:00:54.600> was<00:00:54.750> the

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900 
everybody because what happened was the

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.180 
everybody because what happened was the
food<00:00:55.050> guide<00:00:55.200> pyramid<00:00:55.230> essentially<00:00:56.040> had<00:00:56.160> a

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
food guide pyramid essentially had a

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.910 
food guide pyramid essentially had a
makeover<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:57.090> they<00:00:57.840> realized<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.710> one

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
makeover and they realized that the one

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.770 
makeover and they realized that the one
triangle<00:00:59.370> wasn't<00:00:59.790> effective<00:01:00.180> for<00:01:00.360> everybody

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
triangle wasn't effective for everybody

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.450 
triangle wasn't effective for everybody
so<00:01:01.200> essentially<00:01:01.710> what<00:01:01.830> you're<00:01:01.920> gonna<00:01:02.070> do<00:01:02.280> is

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
so essentially what you're gonna do is

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.880 
so essentially what you're gonna do is
go<00:01:03.060> online<00:01:03.240> to<00:01:03.540> the<00:01:03.660> USDA<00:01:04.080> website<00:01:04.619> and

around 1992 yes do you think the
recommendations<00:01:43.409> were<00:01:43.530> way<00:01:43.740> off<00:01:44.009> or<00:01:44.460> that

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:44.969 
recommendations were way off or that

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:46.699 
recommendations were way off or that
people<00:01:45.149> just<00:01:45.389> didn't<00:01:45.659> follow<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:46.139> correctly

00:01:46.699 --> 00:01:46.709 
people just didn't follow it correctly

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:49.429 
people just didn't follow it correctly
well<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.700> think<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.539> for<00:01:48.899> example<00:01:48.929> if<00:01:49.350> you

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
well I think that for example if you

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.199 
well I think that for example if you
looked<00:01:49.679> at<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.979> recommended<00:01:50.670> servings<00:01:51.030> for

00:01:51.199 --> 00:01:51.209 
looked at the recommended servings for

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:53.059 
looked at the recommended servings for
the<00:01:51.329> grains<00:01:51.569> it<00:01:51.719> was<00:01:51.810> 6<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.109> 11<00:01:52.170> servings<00:01:52.590> and

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:53.069 
the grains it was 6 to 11 servings and

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:55.370 
the grains it was 6 to 11 servings and
for<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.429> woman<00:01:53.850> on<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:53.969> 1600<00:01:54.539> calorie<00:01:54.749> diet<00:01:55.020> if

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
for a woman on a 1600 calorie diet if

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.949 
for a woman on a 1600 calorie diet if
you<00:01:55.770> were<00:01:55.889> to<00:01:56.069> consume<00:01:56.459> 6<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.909> 11<00:01:56.999> servings<00:01:57.420> of

00:01:57.949 --> 00:01:57.959 
you were to consume 6 to 11 servings of

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:00.499 
you were to consume 6 to 11 servings of
grains<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.920> day<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.579> would<00:01:59.729> really<00:01:59.880> need<00:01:59.999> leave

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
grains a day you would really need leave

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.080 
grains a day you would really need leave
no<00:02:00.719> room<00:02:00.990> for<00:02:01.049> balance<00:02:01.560> between<00:02:01.679> your

no room for balance between your

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:04.709 
carbohydrate protein and fat ratio so it

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:07.160 
carbohydrate protein and fat ratio so it
was<00:02:04.889> a<00:02:04.920> little<00:02:05.249> bit<00:02:05.549> less<00:02:06.539> clear<00:02:06.749> as<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.020> how

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
was a little bit less clear as to how

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.570 
was a little bit less clear as to how
are<00:02:07.409> we<00:02:07.560> supposed<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.220> or<00:02:08.340> what<00:02:08.459> are<00:02:08.550> we

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.620 
carbohydrates really have had that you
know<00:02:37.720> a<00:02:37.840> misnomer<00:02:38.110> a<00:02:38.440> bad<00:02:39.220> rap<00:02:39.519> because<00:02:39.790> people

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
know a misnomer a bad rap because people

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:41.970 
know a misnomer a bad rap because people
were<00:02:40.690> over<00:02:40.810> consuming<00:02:41.260> the<00:02:41.349> right<00:02:41.380> kind<00:02:41.799> so

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
were over consuming the right kind so

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
were over consuming the right kind so
it's<00:02:42.099> really<00:02:42.250> important<00:02:42.580> to<00:02:42.640> focus<00:02:42.730> on<00:02:42.940> the

it's really important to focus on the

that<00:02:45.069> everybody<00:02:45.459> needs<00:02:45.730> fiber<00:02:46.150> is<00:02:46.299> very

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
that everybody needs fiber is very

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.970 
that everybody needs fiber is very
important<00:02:46.810> now<00:02:46.930> I<00:02:46.959> know<00:02:47.110> Rania<00:02:47.560> I've<00:02:47.709> talked

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
important now I know Rania I've talked

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.610 
important now I know Rania I've talked
to<00:02:48.130> you<00:02:48.340> about<00:02:48.519> this<00:02:49.120> before<00:02:49.470> talking<00:02:50.470> about

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
to you about this before talking about

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.470 
to you about this before talking about
serving<00:02:51.130> sizes<00:02:51.370> a<00:02:51.580> lot<00:02:51.670> of<00:02:51.910> times<00:02:52.120> that<00:02:52.299> is

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
serving sizes a lot of times that is

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.690 
serving sizes a lot of times that is
hard<00:02:52.780> for<00:02:53.049> people<00:02:53.080> to<00:02:53.470> understand<00:02:53.980> it<00:02:54.489> might

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
hard for people to understand it might

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.250 
hard for people to understand it might
be<00:02:54.730> a<00:02:54.849> little<00:02:55.090> easier<00:02:55.269> now<00:02:55.630> with<00:02:55.660> this<00:02:55.989> new

where<00:03:27.190> it's<00:03:27.430> essentially<00:03:28.180> called<00:03:28.480> my<00:03:28.660> pyramid

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
where it's essentially called my pyramid

where it's essentially called my pyramid
plan<00:03:29.470> you<00:03:30.280> have<00:03:30.579> the<00:03:30.760> opportunity<00:03:31.239> to<00:03:31.359> go<00:03:31.480> in

plan you have the opportunity to go in

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.360 
plan you have the opportunity to go in
and<00:03:31.840> create<00:03:32.139> a<00:03:32.170> customized<00:03:32.709> program<00:03:33.100> that's

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370

also<00:03:33.609> endorsed<00:03:34.239> by<00:03:34.359> the<00:03:34.420> government<00:03:34.989> so<00:03:35.139> it

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
also endorsed by the government so it

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.930 
also endorsed by the government so it
really<00:03:35.410> makes<00:03:35.680> it<00:03:35.859> easier<00:03:36.220> to<00:03:36.370> sway<00:03:36.609> towards
