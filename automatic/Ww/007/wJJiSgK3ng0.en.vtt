April gold options come off the board
and<00:00:47.820> there's<00:00:48.179> some<00:00:48.390> significant<00:00:50.449> bets<00:00:51.449> but<00:00:51.780> on

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
know I assume that there'd be some

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
around that thirteen hundred dollar

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.459 
around that thirteen hundred dollar
level<00:00:59.519> lot<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.300> know<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.449> try<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.749> either

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
the price of Goldman's movements yeah I

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.050 
the price of Goldman's movements yeah I
do<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.500> mean<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:49.829> think<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.280> Fed<00:01:50.490> still<00:01:50.820> is

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
do I mean I think the Fed still is

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.480 
do I mean I think the Fed still is
monitoring<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:52.439> know<00:01:52.469> economic<00:01:53.130> growth<00:01:53.340> and

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
monitoring you know economic growth and

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.620 
monitoring you know economic growth and
economic<00:01:53.640> activity<00:01:54.509> so<00:01:54.810> in<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.710> context<00:01:56.630> the

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
economic activity so in that context the

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.249 
economic activity so in that context the
Fed<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:57.869> very<00:01:58.710> very<00:01:59.009> much<00:01:59.219> aware<00:01:59.579> of<00:02:00.259> economic

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
Fed is very very much aware of economic

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.490 
Fed is very very much aware of economic
data<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.609> the<00:02:02.880> potential<00:02:03.420> growth<00:02:04.049> or

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
data and and the potential growth or

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.889 
data and and the potential growth or
slow<00:02:05.039> down<00:02:05.070> of<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.520> US<00:02:05.789> economy<00:02:05.820> which<00:02:06.600> may

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
slow down of the US economy which may

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.730 
slow down of the US economy which may
impact<00:02:08.060> future<00:02:09.060> decisions<00:02:09.509> on<00:02:09.960> their<00:02:10.259> on

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
impact future decisions on their on

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.940 
impact future decisions on their on
their<00:02:10.800> tapering<00:02:11.580> program<00:02:12.090> but<00:02:12.840> I<00:02:12.920> again<00:02:13.920> have

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
their tapering program but I again have

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.910 
their tapering program but I again have
been<00:02:14.280> in<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.520> camp<00:02:14.790> that<00:02:15.120> it's<00:02:15.990> difficult<00:02:16.740> to

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
been in the camp that it's difficult to

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.330 
been in the camp that it's difficult to
quantify<00:02:18.020> where<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.200> economy<00:02:19.500> is<00:02:19.770> right<00:02:20.130> now

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
quantify where the economy is right now

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.520 
quantify where the economy is right now
because<00:02:20.820> of<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.090> weather

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
because of the weather

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.010 
because of the weather
events<00:02:21.830> of<00:02:22.010> this<00:02:22.160> year<00:02:22.580> and<00:02:22.610> you<00:02:23.150> know<00:02:23.240> I'm<00:02:23.840> not

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
events of this year and you know I'm not

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.650 
events of this year and you know I'm not
saying<00:02:24.319> it<00:02:24.410> was<00:02:24.560> all<00:02:24.709> weather<00:02:24.950> related<00:02:25.360> but<00:02:26.360> I

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
saying it was all weather related but I

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.830 
saying it was all weather related but I
feel<00:02:27.050> as<00:02:27.200> we<00:02:27.380> come<00:02:27.620> in<00:02:27.740> the<00:02:27.860> spring<00:02:28.280> I<00:02:29.270> think

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
feel as we come in the spring I think

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.020 
feel as we come in the spring I think
the<00:02:29.959> economic<00:02:30.560> numbers<00:02:30.740> will<00:02:31.130> better<00:02:31.430> reflect

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
the economic numbers will better reflect

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.910 
the economic numbers will better reflect
consumer<00:02:32.840> confidence<00:02:33.050> and<00:02:33.590> where<00:02:33.770> this

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
consumer confidence and where this

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.340 
consumer confidence and where this
economy<00:02:34.490> is<00:02:34.610> going<00:02:34.819> and<00:02:35.209> it<00:02:35.750> is<00:02:35.900> from<00:02:36.110> that

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
economy is going and it is from that

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.590 
economy is going and it is from that
point<00:02:36.920> that<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.850> Fed<00:02:38.060> would<00:02:38.209> have<00:02:38.390> more

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
point that the Fed would have more

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.449 
point that the Fed would have more
ammunition<00:02:38.930> to<00:02:39.319> make<00:02:39.470> decisions<00:02:39.680> on<00:02:40.190> tapering

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
ammunition to make decisions on tapering

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.720 
ammunition to make decisions on tapering
the<00:02:40.880> way<00:02:41.630> I'm<00:02:41.989> seeing<00:02:42.620> this<00:02:42.860> is<00:02:43.100> I<00:02:43.220> do<00:02:43.280> believe

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
the way I'm seeing this is I do believe

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.729 
the way I'm seeing this is I do believe
the<00:02:43.940> economy<00:02:44.480> will<00:02:44.630> start<00:02:44.900> to<00:02:45.020> grab<00:02:45.230> some<00:02:45.470> legs

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
the economy will start to grab some legs

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.830 
the economy will start to grab some legs
in<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.100> spring<00:02:46.459> and<00:02:46.670> I<00:02:47.209> think<00:02:47.390> consumer

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
in the spring and I think consumer

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.140 
in the spring and I think consumer
confidence<00:02:48.080> will<00:02:48.620> will<00:02:49.130> increase<00:02:49.790> and<00:02:50.120> that

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
confidence will will increase and that

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.449 
confidence will will increase and that
will<00:02:51.110> keep<00:02:51.380> the<00:02:51.590> Fed<00:02:51.800> on<00:02:52.010> its<00:02:52.250> current

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
will keep the Fed on its current

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.300 
will keep the Fed on its current
tapering<00:02:53.000> path<00:02:53.330> to<00:02:54.110> you<00:02:54.739> know<00:02:54.860> to<00:02:55.010> end<00:02:55.190> the

rocky buying of gold or if it was you

rocky buying of gold or if it was you

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
know primarily a Ukraine driven event so

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.920 
know primarily a Ukraine driven event so
I<00:04:18.079> it<00:04:18.470> wasn't<00:04:18.650> certainly<00:04:19.070> a<00:04:19.100> negative<00:04:19.549> factor

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
I it wasn't certainly a negative factor

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.570 
I it wasn't certainly a negative factor
but<00:04:20.930> how<00:04:21.109> much<00:04:21.289> of<00:04:21.350> that<00:04:21.530> gold<00:04:21.859> price<00:04:22.130> move<00:04:22.400> on

but how much of that gold price move on

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.640 
but how much of that gold price move on
the<00:04:22.700> upside<00:04:23.060> was<00:04:23.690> a<00:04:23.720> result<00:04:24.140> of<00:04:24.260> the<00:04:24.380> Iraq<00:04:24.620> and

the upside was a result of the Iraq and

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.650 
the upside was a result of the Iraq and
buying<00:04:25.010> it's<00:04:25.280> difficult<00:04:25.640> to<00:04:25.760> quantify<00:04:25.880> now

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660
