this term means it is the amount of
calories<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.690> would<00:00:45.840> need<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.079> eat<00:00:46.230> each<00:00:46.469> day

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
same as far as weight goes so it takes

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.880 
same as far as weight goes so it takes

go on a cut or a bulk most people use a

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.580 
go on a cut or a bulk most people use a
standard<00:00:59.699> unit<00:00:59.850> of<00:01:00.030> measure<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.480> 500<00:01:01.050> calories

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
standard unit of measure of 500 calories

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.650 
standard unit of measure of 500 calories
either<00:01:01.829> way<00:01:02.129> so<00:01:02.850> for<00:01:03.000> most<00:01:03.120> people<00:01:03.449> who<00:01:03.539> are

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
either way so for most people who are

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.390 
either way so for most people who are
cutting<00:01:03.960> they<00:01:04.290> typically<00:01:04.650> look<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.070> go<00:01:05.220> at<00:01:05.369> a

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
cutting they typically look to go at a

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.240 
cutting they typically look to go at a
500<00:01:06.030> calorie<00:01:06.240> deficit<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.560> reason<00:01:07.830> being<00:01:08.070> is

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
500 calorie deficit the reason being is

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.760 
500 calorie deficit the reason being is
there's<00:01:08.520> 3,500<00:01:09.150> calories<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:10.140> one<00:01:10.380> pound<00:01:10.619> of

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
there's 3,500 calories in one pound of

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.740 
there's 3,500 calories in one pound of
fat<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:11.580> they<00:01:11.700> figure<00:01:12.090> over<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.420> course<00:01:12.659> of

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
fat so they figure over the course of

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.380 
fat so they figure over the course of
the<00:01:12.869> week<00:01:13.049> if<00:01:13.320> they<00:01:13.500> do<00:01:13.680> 500<00:01:14.280> calories<00:01:14.790> deficit

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
the week if they do 500 calories deficit

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.990 
the week if they do 500 calories deficit
each<00:01:15.509> day<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:16.409> will<00:01:16.619> add<00:01:16.770> up<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.009> 3,500

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
each day that will add up to 3,500

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.969 
each day that will add up to 3,500
calories<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.659> they<00:01:18.840> should<00:01:19.080> ideally<00:01:19.560> lose

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
calories and they should ideally lose

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.310 
calories and they should ideally lose
one<00:01:20.369> pound<00:01:20.610> each<00:01:20.880> week<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.810> same<00:01:21.990> thing<00:01:22.229> is

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
one pound each week the same thing is

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.899 
one pound each week the same thing is
usually<00:01:22.650> true<00:01:22.830> when<00:01:22.979> talking<00:01:23.189> about<00:01:23.340> bulking

usually true when talking about bulking
most<00:01:24.180> people<00:01:24.509> go<00:01:24.659> into<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.900> 500<00:01:25.470> calorie

for<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:35.040> what<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.280> want<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.579> also<00:01:35.700> talk<00:01:35.970> about

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
for this what I want to also talk about

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.450 
for this what I want to also talk about
is<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.540> claim<00:01:36.840> versus<00:01:37.229> dirty<00:01:37.470> factor<00:01:38.009> what<00:01:38.430> I

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
is the claim versus dirty factor what I

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.950 
is the claim versus dirty factor what I
want<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.820> stay<00:01:38.970> away<00:01:39.210> from<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.630> peoples

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
want to stay away from is peoples

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.020 
want to stay away from is peoples
typical<00:01:40.380> classifications<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.340> clean<00:01:41.610> versus

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
order to actually see results so just

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.470

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
because you eat something that has maybe

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.780 
because you eat something that has maybe
high<00:02:20.720> calories<00:02:21.200> are<00:02:21.290> high<00:02:21.440> fat<00:02:21.800> it<00:02:22.280> doesn't

bad or unhealthy and I'm going to kind
of<00:02:26.720> take<00:02:26.930> that<00:02:27.110> forward<00:02:27.410> when<00:02:27.590> we<00:02:27.680> talk<00:02:27.860> about

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
of take that forward when we talk about

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.680 
of take that forward when we talk about
the<00:02:28.250> types<00:02:28.490> of<00:02:28.640> bulks<00:02:28.970> out<00:02:29.150> there<00:02:29.360> clean

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
the types of bulks out there clean

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.570 
the types of bulks out there clean
versus<00:02:30.110> dirty<00:02:30.350> so<00:02:31.010> first<00:02:31.250> let's<00:02:31.430> talk<00:02:31.520> about

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
versus dirty so first let's talk about

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.160 
versus dirty so first let's talk about
the<00:02:31.850> definition<00:02:32.000> of<00:02:32.450> clean<00:02:32.660> versus<00:02:32.990> dirty

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
the definition of clean versus dirty

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.050 
the definition of clean versus dirty
bulking<00:02:33.620> and<00:02:33.800> we'll<00:02:33.920> focus<00:02:34.280> on<00:02:34.430> clean<00:02:34.730> first

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
bulking and we'll focus on clean first

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.390 
bulking and we'll focus on clean first
so<00:02:35.750> for<00:02:35.960> a<00:02:35.990> clean<00:02:36.260> bowl<00:02:36.500> was<00:02:36.770> typically<00:02:37.190> done

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
so for a clean bowl was typically done

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.670 
so for a clean bowl was typically done
is<00:02:37.580> a<00:02:37.610> very<00:02:37.880> slight<00:02:38.180> caloric<00:02:38.630> surplus<00:02:38.680> maybe

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
is a very slight caloric surplus maybe

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.920 
is a very slight caloric surplus maybe
something<00:02:40.070> as<00:02:40.160> low<00:02:40.280> as<00:02:40.430> 100<00:02:40.940> or<00:02:41.060> 200<00:02:41.450> calories

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
something as low as 100 or 200 calories

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.720 
something as low as 100 or 200 calories
the<00:02:42.440> reason<00:02:42.680> behind<00:02:42.800> this<00:02:43.130> is<00:02:43.190> because<00:02:43.550> what

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
the reason behind this is because what

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.310 
the reason behind this is because what
we<00:02:43.820> want<00:02:44.090> to<00:02:44.210> do<00:02:44.360> and<00:02:44.540> accomplish<00:02:44.600> here<00:02:45.140> is

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
we want to do and accomplish here is

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.170 
we want to do and accomplish here is
really<00:02:45.560> minimize<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.160> fat<00:02:46.370> gain<00:02:46.610> that<00:02:46.760> we<00:02:46.910> see

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
really minimize the fat gain that we see

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.840 
really minimize the fat gain that we see
and<00:02:47.390> only<00:02:47.870> really<00:02:48.230> focus<00:02:48.590> on<00:02:48.740> lean<00:02:48.980> muscle<00:02:49.010> now

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
and only really focus on lean muscle now

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:50.740 
and only really focus on lean muscle now
I<00:02:49.880> know<00:02:50.060> what<00:02:50.150> you're<00:02:50.270> probably<00:02:50.360> thinking

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
well Brandon you know that's the goal of

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.010 
well Brandon you know that's the goal of
any<00:02:52.520> of<00:02:52.640> us<00:02:52.760> we<00:02:52.910> just<00:02:52.940> want<00:02:53.150> to<00:02:53.390> focus<00:02:53.750> on<00:02:53.870> the

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
any of us we just want to focus on the

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.170 
any of us we just want to focus on the
lean<00:02:54.170> muscle<00:02:54.350> here<00:02:54.740> which<00:02:55.400> is<00:02:55.580> very<00:02:55.640> true

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
lean muscle here which is very true

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.910 
lean muscle here which is very true
however<00:02:56.600> one<00:02:57.350> of<00:02:57.380> the<00:02:57.500> things<00:02:57.680> that<00:02:57.800> you'll

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
however one of the things that you'll

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.290 
however one of the things that you'll
also<00:02:58.070> find<00:02:58.310> with<00:02:58.490> most<00:02:58.610> people<00:02:58.970> is<00:02:59.060> that<00:02:59.150> we're

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
also find with most people is that we're

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.420 
also find with most people is that we're
very<00:02:59.570> impatient<00:03:00.230> I<00:03:00.380> know<00:03:00.709> it<00:03:00.890> happens<00:03:01.190> to<00:03:01.310> me

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
very impatient I know it happens to me

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.430 
very impatient I know it happens to me
sometimes<00:03:01.459> as<00:03:02.090> well<00:03:02.300> where<00:03:02.780> we'd<00:03:02.959> like<00:03:03.140> to<00:03:03.260> see

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
sometimes as well where we'd like to see

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.560 
sometimes as well where we'd like to see
results<00:03:03.860> overnight<00:03:04.310> now<00:03:04.850> unfortunately

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
results overnight now unfortunately

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.180 
results overnight now unfortunately
things<00:03:05.840> don't<00:03:05.990> work<00:03:06.290> that<00:03:06.320> way<00:03:06.709> and<00:03:06.950> what<00:03:07.100> we

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
things don't work that way and what we

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.160 
things don't work that way and what we
need<00:03:07.340> to<00:03:07.430> do<00:03:07.550> is<00:03:07.700> look<00:03:07.880> at<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.150> long<00:03:08.420> term<00:03:08.450> here

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
need to do is look at the long term here

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.890 
need to do is look at the long term here
so<00:03:09.370> with<00:03:10.370> a<00:03:10.400> clean<00:03:10.790> bulk<00:03:11.120> or<00:03:11.300> a<00:03:11.330> very<00:03:11.600> slight

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
so with a clean bulk or a very slight

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.630 
so with a clean bulk or a very slight
caloric<00:03:12.350> surplus<00:03:12.380> what<00:03:13.070> you'll<00:03:13.250> see<00:03:13.459> is<00:03:13.610> a

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
caloric surplus what you'll see is a

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.510 
caloric surplus what you'll see is a
very<00:03:13.790> slow<00:03:14.480> but<00:03:14.900> steady<00:03:15.230> weight<00:03:15.620> gain<00:03:15.920> to<00:03:16.490> the

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
very slow but steady weight gain to the

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.160 
very slow but steady weight gain to the
fact<00:03:16.880> where<00:03:17.030> you<00:03:17.150> can<00:03:17.300> really<00:03:17.510> minimize<00:03:17.720> the

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
fact where you can really minimize the

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.259 
fact where you can really minimize the
amount<00:03:18.410> of<00:03:18.560> fat<00:03:18.769> that<00:03:18.980> you<00:03:19.070> adding<00:03:19.400> on<00:03:19.610> the

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
amount of fat that you adding on the

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.030 
amount of fat that you adding on the
downside<00:03:20.720> for<00:03:20.930> most<00:03:21.110> people<00:03:21.410> doing<00:03:21.709> this<00:03:21.830> is

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
downside for most people doing this is

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.220 
downside for most people doing this is
that<00:03:22.160> it's<00:03:22.310> a<00:03:22.400> very<00:03:22.610> slow<00:03:23.090> process<00:03:23.420> and<00:03:23.900> some

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
that it's a very slow process and some

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.720 
that it's a very slow process and some
people<00:03:24.500> get<00:03:24.620> frustrated<00:03:24.830> at<00:03:25.280> their<00:03:25.459> lack<00:03:25.700> of

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
people get frustrated at their lack of

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.940 
people get frustrated at their lack of
results<00:03:26.360> because<00:03:27.110> what<00:03:27.290> they<00:03:27.410> want<00:03:27.620> to<00:03:27.709> do<00:03:27.800> is

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
results because what they want to do is

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.140 
results because what they want to do is
they<00:03:28.040> want<00:03:28.250> to<00:03:28.310> gain<00:03:28.519> weight<00:03:28.700> and<00:03:28.850> they<00:03:28.970> want

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
they want to gain weight and they want

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.910 
they want to gain weight and they want
to<00:03:29.180> gain<00:03:29.390> muscle<00:03:29.630> which<00:03:30.350> is<00:03:30.380> where<00:03:30.650> dirty

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
to gain muscle which is where dirty

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.340 
to gain muscle which is where dirty
bulking<00:03:31.340> comes<00:03:31.610> in<00:03:31.820> so<00:03:32.150> for<00:03:32.360> me<00:03:32.540> a<00:03:32.780> dirty<00:03:33.110> bowl

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
bulking comes in so for me a dirty bowl

bulking cycle so for someone who's going
on<00:03:43.640> what<00:03:43.700> I<00:03:43.880> call<00:03:44.150> a<00:03:44.180> dirty<00:03:44.480> bulk<00:03:44.780> that's<00:03:45.140> when

on what I call a dirty bulk that's when

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.110 
on what I call a dirty bulk that's when
they're<00:03:45.470> typically<00:03:45.739> going<00:03:45.860> at<00:03:46.250> a<00:03:46.280> 500<00:03:46.850> calorie

they're typically going at a 500 calorie

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.600 
they're typically going at a 500 calorie
surplus<00:03:47.330> or<00:03:47.780> sometimes<00:03:48.200> even<00:03:48.410> more<00:03:48.650> where

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
surplus or sometimes even more where

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.520 
surplus or sometimes even more where
true<00:03:49.970> you<00:03:50.269> will<00:03:50.420> probably<00:03:50.660> add<00:03:50.930> more<00:03:51.170> muscle

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
true you will probably add more muscle

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:52.890 
true you will probably add more muscle
because<00:03:51.800> you're<00:03:51.920> taking<00:03:52.250> in<00:03:52.459> more<00:03:52.760> calories

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
because you're taking in more calories

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.270 
because you're taking in more calories
but<00:03:53.900> the<00:03:54.050> chances<00:03:54.380> of<00:03:54.440> you<00:03:54.560> gaining<00:03:54.830> a<00:03:55.010> lot<00:03:55.130> of

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
but the chances of you gaining a lot of

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.030 
but the chances of you gaining a lot of
fat<00:03:55.550> is<00:03:55.760> also<00:03:55.790> very<00:03:56.480> high<00:03:56.720> as<00:03:56.900> well<00:03:57.200> however

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
fat is also very high as well however

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.710 
fat is also very high as well however
the<00:03:58.250> upside<00:03:58.580> to<00:03:58.610> this<00:03:58.850> is<00:03:59.090> that<00:03:59.269> the<00:03:59.360> results

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
the upside to this is that the results

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.150 
the upside to this is that the results
seem<00:03:59.900> to<00:03:59.930> come<00:04:00.230> quicker<00:04:00.500> because<00:04:00.769> again

seem to come quicker because again

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.699 
seem to come quicker because again
you're<00:04:01.370> taking<00:04:01.580> in<00:04:01.880> more<00:04:02.060> calories<00:04:02.440> over<00:04:03.440> time

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
remain more lean all year round and not

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.170 
remain more lean all year round and not

really carry a high level of body fat
percentage<00:04:34.630> then<00:04:35.170> a<00:04:35.260> clean<00:04:35.560> bulk<00:04:35.800> is<00:04:35.950> probably

percentage then a clean bulk is probably

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.520 
percentage then a clean bulk is probably
for<00:04:36.610> you<00:04:36.790> again<00:04:37.720> one<00:04:38.080> of<00:04:38.170> the<00:04:38.260> things<00:04:38.440> you're

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
for you again one of the things you're

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.780 
for you again one of the things you're
going<00:04:38.650> to<00:04:38.710> want<00:04:38.770> to<00:04:38.950> keep<00:04:39.070> on<00:04:39.190> top<00:04:39.400> of<00:04:39.460> mind

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
going to want to keep on top of mind

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.550 
going to want to keep on top of mind
here<00:04:40.000> is<00:04:40.030> that<00:04:40.300> it's<00:04:40.780> going<00:04:40.990> to<00:04:41.110> take<00:04:41.290> longer

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
here is that it's going to take longer

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.380 
here is that it's going to take longer
to<00:04:41.830> actually<00:04:42.220> see<00:04:42.430> results<00:04:42.580> and<00:04:43.030> see<00:04:43.180> weight

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
to actually see results and see weight

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.360 
to actually see results and see weight
gain<00:04:43.690> but<00:04:44.260> the<00:04:44.410> upside<00:04:44.710> of<00:04:44.770> that<00:04:44.920> is<00:04:45.040> is<00:04:45.340> that

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
gain but the upside of that is is that

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.460 
gain but the upside of that is is that
you<00:04:45.550> should<00:04:45.790> hardly<00:04:46.180> see<00:04:46.390> as<00:04:46.600> much<00:04:46.930> fat<00:04:47.230> gain

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
you should hardly see as much fat gain

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.920 
you should hardly see as much fat gain
as<00:04:47.680> a<00:04:47.710> dirty<00:04:47.980> book<00:04:48.250> which<00:04:49.000> in<00:04:49.360> the<00:04:49.480> long<00:04:49.660> term

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
as a dirty book which in the long term

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.810 
as a dirty book which in the long term
and<00:04:50.080> short<00:04:50.110> term<00:04:50.320> will<00:04:50.860> see<00:04:51.130> faster<00:04:51.670> results

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
and short term will see faster results

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.970 
and short term will see faster results
but<00:04:52.780> with<00:04:52.870> those<00:04:53.050> results<00:04:53.500> you're<00:04:53.590> likely<00:04:53.800> to

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
but with those results you're likely to

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.010 
but with those results you're likely to
carry<00:04:54.280> a<00:04:54.490> more<00:04:54.820> high<00:04:55.030> percentage<00:04:55.630> of<00:04:55.690> body<00:04:55.870> fat

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
carry a more high percentage of body fat

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.650 
carry a more high percentage of body fat
so<00:04:56.890> when<00:04:57.280> it<00:04:57.370> comes<00:04:57.550> down<00:04:57.730> to<00:04:57.790> it<00:04:58.120> it's<00:04:58.420> really

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
so when it comes down to it it's really

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:59.910 
so when it comes down to it it's really
up<00:04:58.870> to<00:04:59.020> you<00:04:59.140> as<00:04:59.290> far<00:04:59.470> as<00:04:59.590> what<00:04:59.770> you're

00:04:59.910 --> 00:04:59.920 
up to you as far as what you're

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.350 
up to you as far as what you're
comfortable<00:05:00.310> holding<00:05:00.490> as<00:05:00.790> far<00:05:00.970> as<00:05:01.090> how<00:05:01.180> your

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
comfortable holding as far as how your

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.360 
comfortable holding as far as how your
body<00:05:01.540> composition<00:05:01.930> goes<00:05:02.170> but<00:05:02.980> either<00:05:03.100> way

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
body composition goes but either way

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.130 
body composition goes but either way
both<00:05:03.760> are<00:05:03.970> effective<00:05:04.420> ways<00:05:04.540> of<00:05:04.840> gaining

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
both are effective ways of gaining

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.750 
both are effective ways of gaining
muscle<00:05:05.590> and<00:05:05.770> seeing<00:05:06.010> results<00:05:06.160> in<00:05:06.460> the<00:05:06.580> long

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
muscle and seeing results in the long

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.550 
muscle and seeing results in the long
run<00:05:07.000> hope<00:05:07.720> they<00:05:07.870> answer<00:05:08.050> some<00:05:08.200> questions

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
run hope they answer some questions

run hope they answer some questions
