00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
so this is my 2003 yamaha fz1 iphone

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.810 
so this is my 2003 yamaha fz1 iphone
charger<00:00:07.849> wiring<00:00:08.849> route<00:00:10.519> started<00:00:11.519> off<00:00:11.639> by

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
charger wiring route started off by

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.560 
charger wiring route started off by
getting<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:12.710> battery<00:00:13.710> tender<00:00:14.040> pig<00:00:14.670> cable

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
getting a battery tender pig cable

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.920 
getting a battery tender pig cable
attached<00:00:16.410> it<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.830> battery<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.690> I<00:00:18.690> didn't

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
attached it to the battery and I didn't

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.800 
attached it to the battery and I didn't
want<00:00:19.050> it<00:00:19.080> running<00:00:19.350> all<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.590> time<00:00:19.619> so<00:00:20.160> I<00:00:20.810> only

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
want it running all the time so I only

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.210 
want it running all the time so I only
attached<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.350> ground<00:00:23.869> to<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.109> negative<00:00:25.949> on

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
attached the ground to the negative on

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.589 
attached the ground to the negative on
the<00:00:26.340> battery<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:26.960> then<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.080> positive<00:00:29.539> has<00:00:30.539> a

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
the battery and then the positive has a

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.950 
the battery and then the positive has a
7.5<00:00:31.590> amp<00:00:31.859> fuse<00:00:32.399> here<00:00:32.730> attached<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.840> the

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
7.5 amp fuse here attached it to the

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.060 
7.5 amp fuse here attached it to the
wiring<00:00:34.350> harness<00:00:34.739> into<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.460> fuse<00:00:35.730> box<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:37.070> I

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
wiring harness into the fuse box and I

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.540 
wiring harness into the fuse box and I
went<00:00:38.280> through<00:00:38.750> this<00:00:39.750> 20<00:00:40.290> amp<00:00:40.500> fuse<00:00:41.010> right<00:00:41.219> here

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
went through this 20 amp fuse right here

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.750 
went through this 20 amp fuse right here
which<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:43.469> actual<00:00:43.680> ignition<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.670> only

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
which is the actual ignition so it only

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.150 
which is the actual ignition so it only
comes<00:00:45.030> on<00:00:45.239> with<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:46.700> when<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.789> key<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.030> on<00:00:49.160> so

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
comes on with the when the key is on so

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.160 
comes on with the when the key is on so
that's<00:00:50.309> really<00:00:50.399> cool<00:00:51.949> and<00:00:52.949> then<00:00:53.489> from<00:00:53.670> there

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
that's really cool and then from there

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.610 
that's really cool and then from there
it<00:00:55.170> comes<00:00:55.350> underneath<00:00:55.770> here<00:00:57.109> up<00:00:58.109> underneath

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
it comes underneath here up underneath

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.549 
it comes underneath here up underneath
where<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.390> tank<00:01:00.390> sits<00:01:00.750> have<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.140> tank<00:01:01.350> up

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
where the tank sits have the tank up

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.690 
where the tank sits have the tank up
right<00:01:01.800> now<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.190> can<00:01:02.309> see<00:01:02.460> on<00:01:02.520> anything

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700 
right now so you can see on anything

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.590 
right now so you can see on anything
underneath<00:01:05.960> all<00:01:06.960> right<00:01:07.229> here<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.710> the

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
underneath all right here to the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.219 
underneath all right here to the
cigarette<00:01:09.600> lighter<00:01:09.780> adapter<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:10.500> have<00:01:12.049> just<00:01:13.049> a

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
cigarette lighter adapter I have just a

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.480 
cigarette lighter adapter I have just a
double<00:01:13.950> USB<00:01:14.790> adapter<00:01:15.659> here<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.080> I've<00:01:17.009> put<00:01:17.220> hot

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
double USB adapter here and I've put hot

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.520 
double USB adapter here and I've put hot
glue<00:01:17.850> in<00:01:18.500> so<00:01:19.500> it's<00:01:20.509> hopefully<00:01:21.509> waterproof<00:01:22.350> or

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
glue in so it's hopefully waterproof or

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.490 
glue in so it's hopefully waterproof or
water<00:01:22.740> resistant<00:01:23.250> at<00:01:23.340> least<00:01:23.900> and<00:01:24.900> it's<00:01:25.409> a

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
water resistant at least and it's a

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.440 
water resistant at least and it's a
double<00:01:25.860> USB<00:01:26.189> adapter<00:01:26.790> so<00:01:26.909> i<00:01:26.939> just<00:01:27.150> plugged<00:01:27.299> it

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
double USB adapter so i just plugged it

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.310 
double USB adapter so i just plugged it
up<00:01:27.570> with<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.680> second<00:01:29.240> hole<00:01:30.240> with<00:01:30.570> some

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
up with the the second hole with some

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.740 
up with the the second hole with some
hot<00:01:31.470> glue<00:01:31.619> this<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.520> also<00:01:32.700> hot<00:01:33.000> glued<00:01:33.240> in<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:33.659> it

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
hot glue this is also hot glued in so it

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.830 
hot glue this is also hot glued in so it
doesn't<00:01:34.310> doesn't<00:01:35.310> get<00:01:35.490> water<00:01:35.700> in<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.000> then

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
doesn't doesn't get water in it and then

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.960 
doesn't doesn't get water in it and then
the<00:01:36.990> iphone<00:01:37.340> cord<00:01:38.340> goes<00:01:38.729> all<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.060> way<00:01:39.240> through

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
the iphone cord goes all the way through

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.280 
the iphone cord goes all the way through

and iphone 4 it's really cool so I
waterproof<00:02:00.180> for<00:02:00.420> water<00:02:00.810> resistant<00:02:01.290> actually

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
waterproof for water resistant actually

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.579 
waterproof for water resistant actually
so<00:02:02.310> there<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.520> go
