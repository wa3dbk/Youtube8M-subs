McRib<00:02:21.890> does<00:02:22.519> I<00:02:22.849> guess<00:02:23.030> that's<00:02:23.269> the<00:02:23.360> point<00:02:23.629> of

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
McRib does I guess that's the point of

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.130 
McRib does I guess that's the point of
it<00:02:24.049> it<00:02:24.349> was<00:02:24.650> nice<00:02:25.040> and<00:02:25.069> porky<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:26.329> chewy<00:02:26.690> and

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
it it was nice and porky and chewy and

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.000 
it it was nice and porky and chewy and
soft<00:02:27.829> and<00:02:28.280> it<00:02:28.400> didn't<00:02:28.760> give<00:02:28.970> off<00:02:29.180> like<00:02:29.620> we<00:02:30.620> blew

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
soft and it didn't give off like we blew

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.479 
soft and it didn't give off like we blew
in<00:02:31.220> our<00:02:31.549> tofu<00:02:32.090> texture<00:02:32.780> like<00:02:33.019> that<00:02:33.049> mushy<00:02:33.980> chew

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
in our tofu texture like that mushy chew

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.390 
in our tofu texture like that mushy chew
it<00:02:34.760> was<00:02:34.909> kind<00:02:35.180> of<00:02:35.269> texturized<00:02:36.019> and<00:02:36.349> it<00:02:36.980> tastes

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
it was kind of texturized and it tastes

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.420 
it was kind of texturized and it tastes
kinda<00:02:37.790> like<00:02:37.819> pork<00:02:38.359> and<00:02:38.659> with<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:39.049> BBQ<00:02:39.560> slap<00:02:40.250> it

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
kinda like pork and with the BBQ slap it

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.509 
kinda like pork and with the BBQ slap it
on<00:02:40.549> top<00:02:40.909> it<00:02:41.209> was<00:02:41.450> a<00:02:41.510> little<00:02:41.930> misleading<00:02:42.470> to<00:02:43.340> the

on top it was a little misleading to the
tongue<00:02:43.970> I<00:02:44.569> would<00:02:45.140> give<00:02:45.379> this<00:02:45.620> to<00:02:45.920> people<00:02:46.310> who

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
tongue I would give this to people who

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.610 
tongue I would give this to people who
like<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:46.849> McRib<00:02:47.060> I<00:02:47.569> would<00:02:47.840> tell<00:02:48.049> them<00:02:48.260> to<00:02:48.440> try

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620
