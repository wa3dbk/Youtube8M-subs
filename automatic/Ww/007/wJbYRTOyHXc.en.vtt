00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 hello friends coaches welcome to 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.970
 first chapter of a series in which 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.740
 let's analyze all the concepts that 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.900
 we need to start playing because 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.400
 mont competitively 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.309
 whether you want to participate in some 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.719
 tournament or increase your rating or maybe 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.910
 you just want to ridicule your 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.619
 good friends here we're going to learn everything 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.119
 what we need to have advantage 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.730
 about our opponents always and 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.439
 when they do not know it although I know 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.880
 that everyone when they start playing 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.699
 they want to know immediately all the 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.160
 secrets about parenting and how to distribute 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.590
 in fort yes yes but it seems to me that it is 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.660
 better to start with the basics as well 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.640
 We can make our own 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.219
 strategies instead of just copying 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.200
 the internet and even if we copy them to 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.969
 Less we will know why and how they work 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.620
 exactly that is why in this 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.210
 first chapter we'll start at the most 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.730
 basic what are the states that we see in 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.050
 screen like the hp and the attack that does not 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.789
 they are as obvious as they seem in 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.280
 first sight so without further ado 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.969
 let's start 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.969
 i 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.729
 what are the states if we open our 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.409
 game and we reviewed the options that 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.659
 appear when we check the status of 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.149
 our pokémon we will see the options 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.950
 to change it to use an item and 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:15.560
 up we have the option to add 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.149
 and here apart from seeing a portrait of 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.070
 our pokemon and a list of their 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:21.770
 attacks we also find ourselves with 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.020
 information like nature skill 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.179
 and a lot of antics that if you're not 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.520
 very nailed of video games maybe not 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:30.710
 are so clear good these 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.140
 Numbers determine the weaknesses and 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.060
 strengths of our pokémon to large 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.039
 traits the attack determines how 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.959
 strong are the pokemon hits and the 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:41.840
 defense dictates how capable of 

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:44.149
 receive them for saying something seems simple 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.009
 and if it is but not all that these 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.659
 numbers represent is so obvious in 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.549
 special when we want to understand them 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.830
 to make combat strategies a 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.750
 much more advanced so let's 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.549
 review with great detail each one of 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.090
 the states in the same order as 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.090
 appear on screen 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.890
 i 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.070
 hp 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.170
 the hp that is the abbreviation of heat 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.260
 points is the simplest one though one of 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.970
 the most important basically the hp 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.950
 determines how many hits you can take 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.480
 our pokemon before fainting and 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.230
 become unusable during the rest of the 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.150
 combat for example if an attack does 50 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.860
 damage points and the pokemon that defends 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.660
 has 200 hits points 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.060
 this can withstand three equal hits 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.769
 until fainting in the fourth shift is 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.660
 why monsters like brixio wow 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.849
 feet can resist a quantity 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.590
 considerable of attacks before falling already 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.890
 that both have a huge amount of 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.870
 hp that supports them for example breaking 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.049
 a pretty decent Pokémon at the moment 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.209
 of receiving blows reaches 404 points 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:50.420
 hp at level 100 while bliss and 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.910
 also at level 100 it reaches 714 points 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.280
 the highest amount of hp in all the 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.319
 game if we go back to our example in 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.440
 where a Pokémon receives an attack that 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:02.840
 reduces 50 points are to resist a 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.870
 total of nine turns is eight 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.989
 blows and a little bit but bliss and resists 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.670
 a total of 15 turns almost double 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.660
 took the opportunity to clarify that the numbers 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.000
 of my examples 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.730
 they refer to the maximum possible status 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.590
 that can reach a pokemon notice this 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.270
 so that no one is disappointed and runs to 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.330
 Check your game and discover that your bliss 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.700
 and it does not reach 714 hp but a lot 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.770
 least this is due to several factors that 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.420
 they explain in future videos but for 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.330
 Now let's focus on the 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.770
 basic concepts anyway what 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.440
 previous is just an example 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.500
 hypothetical in real battles the 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.330
 attacks do not always do the same damage 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.120
 how can we determine hp points 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.950
 that are reduced from the defending pokemon 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.460
 good for that we serve the rest of 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.460
 the states 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.130
 attack 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.319
 attacks l stat which roughly 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.230
 how much damage can ends 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:01.450
 our pokémon the more attack more 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.670
 damage we can do there are some 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.170
 special rules since it is not the same 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.599
 a physical attack that a special attack 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.060
 but we'll see that later in his 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:11.830
 respective section when a pokemon 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.470
 launched in motion anyone like 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.389
 earthquake or body slam the game is 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.010
 responsible for determining hp points 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.320
 that are going to be reduced from the monster that 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:24.190
 receives the blow using the following 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:26.139
 formula I will not explain now how to solve 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.729
 the equation but I put it here for 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:28.000
 show the parameters that the 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.490
 game 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.900
 if you really like math at the end 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.120
 of the video you can solve the equation 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.340
 on your own and with the example that 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.200
 want though if you're interested in knowing 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.510
 the results of very very cases 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.639
 specific and there are calculators in 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.380
 internet that will take care of that I'll put 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:46.570
 the link in the description although for 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.130
 use the calculator you need to know about 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.440
 other concepts that we will not cover the 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.270
 Today, the only thing that we have to 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.310
 know for now is that the more 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.860
 attack our movements do more 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.960
 damage for example if hack soros and there's no 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.509
 burn use the same movement 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:05.080
 let's say outrage against it 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:08.169
 pokemon in this case goes net ajax oros 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.780
 with a maximum of 432 attack points to 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:13.090
 level 100 would take only one turn 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.250
 tear to banet and be ready to 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.009
 crush the next pokemon while 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.440
 that did not go with 262 points also to 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:22.599
 level 100 would take two turns of another 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.160
 and banet will expire long enough 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:26.020
 for the ghost to respond with a 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.539
 movement itself and endanger 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.250
 our pokemon this is a good time 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:32.770
 to explain a small detail that 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.660
 affects the year of the pokemon and that is not 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:38.259
 very clear within the game the term 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:40.690
 known as start stop means same 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:42.520
 time attack bonus and is the name that 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.289
 the fans were given the bonus that the 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.240
 attacks when a movement is 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:48.460
 used by a Pokémon of the same type 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.889
 the increase provided by the staff 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.979
 is 50 percent the same as 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:56.949
 multiply the attack by 1.5 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:59.380
 this means two things the first the 

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:02.169
 attacks just like the pokemon come 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.720
 in a variety of 18 different types and 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:05.920
 each attack belongs to a category 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.560
 there are water type attacks 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.360
 or ghost and so on and if we have doubts 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.340
 about what type our attack belongs 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.310
 we can review it on the screen 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:17.860
 add and below our states 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.560
 second a movement used by a 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.630
 Pokemon of the same type will always be a 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.850
 and a half times stronger than himself 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:27.280
 movement used by a Pokémon of 

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:29.650
 different type even if both pokemon 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:32.740
 had the same amount of attack per 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.690
 example if tiran itar uses outrage or 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:37.090
 the dragon-like movement against 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:39.010
 bank &amp; needs two shifts to knock him out 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:41.140
 the other because unlike pokemon 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:42.870
 hacks or throw them itar is not dragon type 

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.370
 and although both have an attack 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:47.710
 considerably high jackson receives the 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:49.420
 staff bonus and soul train is one and 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:52.450
 half time stronger than Tyran 

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:54.370
 internal on the other hand if they shoot and tar 

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:56.950
 uses the rock type movement as 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:59.200
 stoner can knock out banet in a single 

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:01.240
 turn while the sorce hack does not 

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.230
 could despite his attack is more 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.480
 high than that of tyran and such 

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:06.500
 and this is all for today in the next 

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.450
 chapter we will see how it works 

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.250
 exactly the defense and the super 

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:11.810
 Effective invite you to subscribe 

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:14.660
 to know when the 

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:16.310
 next chapter will be soon and any 

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.860
 doubt about what we saw in this video I 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:21.250
 they can let you know by twitter up 

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.250
 the next
