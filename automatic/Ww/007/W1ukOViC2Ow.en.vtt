get<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.680> pleasure<00:00:37.980> off<00:00:38.450> probably<00:00:39.450> won't

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
get to the pleasure off probably won't

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.479 
get to the pleasure off probably won't
last<00:00:40.020> very<00:00:40.260> long<00:00:40.500> at<00:00:40.739> all<00:00:40.860> cuz<00:00:41.040> it's<00:00:41.160> actually

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
last very long at all cuz it's actually

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.500 
last very long at all cuz it's actually
a<00:00:41.520> hard<00:00:41.820> quest<00:00:42.239> anyway<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.890> if<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.100> knew

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
a hard quest anyway so if you knew

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.420 
a hard quest anyway so if you knew
really<00:00:45.510> it's<00:00:45.660> probably<00:00:46.260> not<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.649> best<00:00:46.890> place

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
really it's probably not the best place

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.880 
really it's probably not the best place
to<00:00:47.940> start<00:00:48.410> but<00:00:49.410> anyway<00:00:50.360> regardless<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.629> that

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
to start but anyway regardless of that

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.889 
to start but anyway regardless of that
so<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:52.920> quit<00:00:53.219> look<00:00:53.370> at<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.579> scenery<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.210> then

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
so I quit look at the scenery and then

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.930 
so I quit look at the scenery and then
like<00:00:55.110> i<00:00:55.140> said<00:00:55.410> i'll<00:00:55.530> i'll<00:00:56.280> try<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.610> get<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.850> the

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
like i said i'll i'll try to get to the

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.830 
like i said i'll i'll try to get to the
plezi<00:00:57.360> off<00:00:57.480> fairly<00:00:58.440> rapidly<00:00:59.309> and<00:01:01.399> then<00:01:02.840> we

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
plezi off fairly rapidly and then we

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.320 
plezi off fairly rapidly and then we
will<00:01:04.339> show<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.460> little<00:01:05.580> bit<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.850> action<00:01:06.150> not

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
will show you a little bit of action not

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.760 
will show you a little bit of action not
gonna<00:01:06.479> make<00:01:06.630> this<00:01:06.750> video<00:01:06.990> too<00:01:07.200> long<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.619> won't

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
gonna make this video too long it won't

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.270 
gonna make this video too long it won't
last<00:01:08.100> very<00:01:08.310> long<00:01:08.490> anyway<00:01:09.020> so<00:01:10.020> it's<00:01:10.860> definitely

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
last very long anyway so it's definitely

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.000 
last very long anyway so it's definitely
definitely<00:01:11.909> again<00:01:12.659> you're<00:01:13.470> going<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.680> need<00:01:13.830> if

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
definitely again you're going to need if

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.560 
definitely again you're going to need if
you<00:01:14.159> really<00:01:14.400> really<00:01:14.520> really<00:01:14.880> get<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.270> games

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
you really really really get a games

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.050 
you really really really get a games
then<00:01:15.930> you'll<00:01:16.350> probably<00:01:16.590> be<00:01:16.770> fine<00:01:17.060> but

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
then you'll probably be fine but

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.010 
then you'll probably be fine but
generally<00:01:18.780> it's<00:01:19.110> going<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.409> take<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.619> few<00:01:19.979> hours

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
generally it's going to take a few hours

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.830 
generally it's going to take a few hours
they<00:01:22.020> are<00:01:22.080> forgetting<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:23.270> its<00:01:24.270> what<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.689> that

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
they are forgetting to its what is that

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.840 
they are forgetting to its what is that
our<00:01:25.020> guy<00:01:25.049> over<00:01:25.530> there<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:25.950> know<00:01:26.310> he's<00:01:26.490> just<00:01:26.610> gone

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.300
