you could roll them up there's some guys

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.260 
you could roll them up there's some guys
that'll<00:01:28.100> actually<00:01:28.220> just<00:01:28.520> take<00:01:28.729> the<00:01:28.759> full<00:01:29.090> rack

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
that'll actually just take the full rack

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.910 
that'll actually just take the full rack
of<00:01:29.450> ribs<00:01:29.540> and<00:01:29.780> kind<00:01:30.020> of<00:01:30.080> do<00:01:30.200> a<00:01:30.259> little<00:01:30.380> pinwheel

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
of ribs and kind of do a little pinwheel

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.010 
of ribs and kind of do a little pinwheel
thing<00:01:31.220> you<00:01:31.670> could<00:01:31.970> do<00:01:32.119> that<00:01:32.300> approach<00:01:32.720> but

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
thing you could do that approach but

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.139 
thing you could do that approach but
it's<00:01:33.680> much<00:01:33.920> easier<00:01:34.310> just<00:01:34.369> to<00:01:34.580> cut<00:01:34.850> these<00:01:34.970> in

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
it's much easier just to cut these in

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:36.790 
it's much easier just to cut these in
half<00:01:35.330> and<00:01:35.660> then<00:01:35.990> all<00:01:36.110> we're<00:01:36.229> gonna<00:01:36.320> do<00:01:36.530> like

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
half and then all we're gonna do like

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.639 
half and then all we're gonna do like
usual<00:01:37.280> is<00:01:37.430> just<00:01:37.640> give<00:01:37.790> them<00:01:38.030> a<00:01:38.060> little<00:01:38.649> mustard

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
usual is just give them a little mustard

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:42.309 
usual is just give them a little mustard
binding<00:01:40.250> and<00:01:40.460> then<00:01:41.119> we're<00:01:41.330> gonna<00:01:41.420> get<00:01:42.110> them

00:01:42.309 --> 00:01:42.319 
binding and then we're gonna get them

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:44.680 
binding and then we're gonna get them
dusted<00:01:42.800> down<00:01:43.039> with<00:01:43.369> whatever<00:01:43.610> your<00:01:44.240> favorite

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
setup here so I've got the grill

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.260 
setup here so I've got the grill
extender<00:02:16.850> rack<00:02:17.090> on<00:02:17.330> here<00:02:17.660> I've<00:02:18.440> got<00:02:19.270> two

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
extender rack on here I've got two

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.720 
extender rack on here I've got two
halves<00:02:20.660> down<00:02:21.050> on<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.319> bottom<00:02:21.500> and<00:02:21.920> then<00:02:22.550> what

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
halves down on the bottom and then what

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.790 
halves down on the bottom and then what
I've<00:02:22.849> done<00:02:23.030> up<00:02:23.360> top<00:02:23.720> and<00:02:24.020> you'll<00:02:24.170> see<00:02:24.410> this<00:02:24.560> if

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
I've done up top and you'll see this if

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.140 
I've done up top and you'll see this if
you<00:02:24.920> guys<00:02:25.040> pick<00:02:25.400> up<00:02:25.550> one<00:02:25.730> of<00:02:25.760> these<00:02:25.910> for

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
you guys pick up one of these for

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.750 
you guys pick up one of these for
yourself<00:02:26.240> but<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:27.530> stem<00:02:27.920> from<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.550> dome

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
yourself but the stem from the dome

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.630 
yourself but the stem from the dome
thermometer<00:02:29.480> comes<00:02:30.380> down<00:02:30.560> about<00:02:30.770> that<00:02:31.010> far<00:02:31.340> so

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
thermometer comes down about that far so

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.850 
thermometer comes down about that far so
I've<00:02:31.730> got<00:02:31.970> these<00:02:32.209> two<00:02:32.540> pieces<00:02:32.780> up<00:02:33.110> here<00:02:33.140> angled

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
I've got these two pieces up here angled

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.520 
I've got these two pieces up here angled
this<00:02:34.040> way<00:02:34.250> so<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.090> stem<00:02:35.390> can<00:02:35.810> go<00:02:36.020> in<00:02:36.110> between

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
this way so the stem can go in between

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.740 
this way so the stem can go in between
and<00:02:36.800> not<00:02:36.890> actually<00:02:37.310> hit<00:02:37.520> the<00:02:37.670> meat<00:02:37.880> so<00:02:38.240> you

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
and not actually hit the meat so you

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.540 
and not actually hit the meat so you
probably<00:02:38.990> could<00:02:39.319> actually<00:02:39.500> even<00:02:39.890> tweak<00:02:40.340> out

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
probably could actually even tweak out

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.640 
probably could actually even tweak out
this<00:02:40.819> small<00:02:41.180> model<00:02:41.599> with<00:02:41.750> a<00:02:41.780> with<00:02:42.110> a<00:02:42.140> shorter

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
this small model with a with a shorter

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.890 
this small model with a with a shorter
stem<00:02:42.950> thermometer<00:02:43.640> but<00:02:44.270> you<00:02:44.360> can<00:02:44.510> see<00:02:44.720> that

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
stem thermometer but you can see that

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.800 
stem thermometer but you can see that
we've<00:02:45.020> got<00:02:45.200> two<00:02:45.769> large<00:02:46.370> racks<00:02:46.849> of<00:02:47.150> ribs<00:02:47.180> that

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810
