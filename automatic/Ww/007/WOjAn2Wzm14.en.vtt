00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.160 
then put my own little custom touch on
there<00:02:47.860> and<00:02:48.860> glued<00:02:49.100> them<00:02:49.250> together<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:50.450> fuses

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
there and glued them together the fuses

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.860 
there and glued them together the fuses
are<00:02:53.650> twine<00:02:54.650> that<00:02:55.370> I've<00:02:55.520> separated<00:02:55.790> and<00:02:56.480> rolled

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
are twine that I've separated and rolled

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.530 
are twine that I've separated and rolled
in<00:02:57.110> the<00:02:57.260> thinner<00:02:57.530> strips<00:02:58.300> then<00:02:59.300> I<00:03:01.540> painted

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
in the thinner strips then I painted

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.630 
in the thinner strips then I painted
those<00:03:02.690> strips<00:03:03.140> and<00:03:03.380> glue<00:03:03.440> them<00:03:03.830> tight<00:03:04.130> so<00:03:04.610> that

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
those strips and glue them tight so that

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.690 
those strips and glue them tight so that
they<00:03:05.000> get<00:03:05.660> a<00:03:05.690> little<00:03:05.960> firm<00:03:06.290> too<00:03:06.590> and<00:03:09.580> then<00:03:10.580> I

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
they get a little firm too and then I

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.020 
they get a little firm too and then I
took<00:03:10.760> a<00:03:10.970> piece<00:03:11.660> of<00:03:11.870> black<00:03:12.080> duct<00:03:12.410> tape<00:03:12.680> and

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
took a piece of black duct tape and

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.760 
took a piece of black duct tape and
wrapped<00:03:14.030> it<00:03:14.210> around<00:03:14.300> there<00:03:14.780> I'll<00:03:15.320> use<00:03:15.530> duct

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
wrapped it around there I'll use duct

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.020 
wrapped it around there I'll use duct
tape<00:03:15.800> because<00:03:16.250> I<00:03:16.280> know<00:03:16.520> it<00:03:16.580> won't<00:03:16.790> come<00:03:17.000> off

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
tape because I know it won't come off

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.990 
tape because I know it won't come off
that'll<00:03:17.600> be<00:03:17.690> on<00:03:17.870> there<00:03:18.190> this<00:03:19.190> is<00:03:19.340> a<00:03:19.370> waterproof

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
that'll be on there this is a waterproof

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.750 
that'll be on there this is a waterproof
duct<00:03:20.420> tape

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
duct tape

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:30.460 
duct tape
you<00:03:22.760> know<00:03:22.910> duct<00:03:23.150> tape<00:03:23.180> holds<00:03:23.750> everything<00:03:24.200> so

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.590 

third<00:03:31.130> thing<00:03:31.340> I<00:03:31.460> made<00:03:31.930> this<00:03:32.930> little<00:03:33.230> iPhone

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
third thing I made this little iPhone

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.660 
third thing I made this little iPhone

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
this is a sheet of lexan and a cut and

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.850 
this is a sheet of lexan and a cut and
sanded<00:03:38.090> down<00:03:38.200> and<00:03:39.200> then<00:03:39.380> I<00:03:39.470> put<00:03:39.680> a<00:03:39.710> little

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
sanded down and then I put a little

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:46.000 
sanded down and then I put a little
backing<00:03:40.190> on<00:03:40.610> there<00:03:42.790> and<00:03:44.140> then<00:03:45.140> the<00:03:45.500> last<00:03:45.740> thing

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
backing on there and then the last thing

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.950 
backing on there and then the last thing
I<00:03:46.160> made<00:03:46.400> is<00:03:47.090> probably<00:03:47.450> the<00:03:47.600> thing<00:03:47.750> I'm<00:03:47.930> a
