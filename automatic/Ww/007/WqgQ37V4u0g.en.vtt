 i 

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.240
 hello welcome to ney lines if you want 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.670
 know how to make these nails with 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.410
 velvet hearts keep looking 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:19.110
 you will need a glaze for the background 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.680
 I used red an enamel of the same color as 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:25.290
 velvet mine is black a cardboard with 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.009
 similar surface a tool of 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:31.890
 points a container as a plate 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:33.750
 velvet powder and a brush in 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.660
 First, let's paint the nail with 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.730
 the background glaze as I told you 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.559
 I'm going to use red but you can use 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.000
 Any color that matches well with 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.000
 your velvet powder 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.400
 when I know we prepare the surface 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.530
 of work putting the container that 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.350
 will serve as much support as to collect 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.170
 after the leftovers the dust 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.840
 velvet and cardboard all together 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.970
 this is important because then we must 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.340
 be quick we put a few drops of 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.860
 black enamel on the cardboard or surface 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.930
 similar we wet the tool well 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.090
 points and we draw a heart 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.820
 dragging the points tool 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.950
 top down first to the side and 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.100
 then to the other making sure that we 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.560
 it is well wet we put the finger in the 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:36.990
 velvet boat and we squeeze so that 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.990
 impregnate well then we take it out 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.350
 we remove the cardboard so that it does not 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.909
 stain the excess enamel we give 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.399
 taps on the velvet for 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.590
 sit on the nail and with the brush of 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.810
 makeup we remove the hairs that we 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.729
 they have stuck doing the movement of 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.630
 up and down to remove well the 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.630
 beak hairs 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.890
 we repeat the operation as many times as 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.170
 we want you can make hearts more 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.360
 large or smaller and according to the 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.260
 surface of your nails and the size of 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.540
 hearts can put more or less be 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.340
 however, and advice you try to make 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.200
 the top part slightly separated 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.540
 so that then the peak of 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.190
 the hearts and that you do not try to do 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.530
 more than two or three hearts at a time 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.239
 it is possible for the enamel to dry 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.000
 before it sticks it comes to the third 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.160
 comb also make sure that the 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.690
 hearts have enough enamel like 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.970
 to allow the velvet to 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.099
 hit and when you go to remove the excess 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.160
 do not forget to leave the 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:50.260
 cardboard or stain residues as 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.019
 Although it may seem difficult, it is very 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.980
 easy but the trick to doing it right is 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.980
 do it fast 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.010
 and our nails with hearts of 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.330
 velvet are ready if you liked 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.790
