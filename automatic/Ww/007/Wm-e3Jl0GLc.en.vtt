00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.589 
probably a pretty good number throttle
position<00:02:07.789> again<00:02:08.789> this<00:02:08.940> is<00:02:09.149> electronic

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
position again this is electronic

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.210 
position again this is electronic
throttle<00:02:09.810> control<00:02:09.959> so<00:02:10.560> that's<00:02:10.709> probably<00:02:11.039> a

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
throttle control so that's probably a

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.740

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750

you<00:02:13.740> know<00:02:13.860> maybe<00:02:14.100> that<00:02:14.390> sensor<00:02:15.390> didn't<00:02:15.630> find<00:02:15.840> a

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
you know maybe that sensor didn't find a

you know maybe that sensor didn't find a

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
box thingy that the guy put on so we

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.460 
box thingy that the guy put on so we

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
might want to go find out where the IAT

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.190 
might want to go find out where the IAT

this point we got 89% ve that's looking

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.900 
this point we got 89% ve that's looking
pretty<00:03:39.540> good<00:03:39.810> we<00:03:40.470> can<00:03:40.680> bring<00:03:41.250> up<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.610> general

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
pretty good we can bring up the general

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.479 
pretty good we can bring up the general
rule<00:03:42.239> here<00:03:42.269> the<00:03:42.900> engine<00:03:43.140> leaders<00:03:43.650> times<00:03:43.950> 40

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
rule here the engine leaders times 40

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.520 
rule here the engine leaders times 40
equals<00:03:45.180> grams<00:03:45.630> per<00:03:45.900> second<00:03:46.290> at<00:03:46.350> wide<00:03:46.500> open

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
equals grams per second at wide open

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.090 
equals grams per second at wide open
throttle<00:03:46.860> so<00:03:47.489> if<00:03:47.580> we<00:03:47.730> did<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.950> calculation<00:03:49.950> on

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
throttle so if we did the calculation on

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.270 
throttle so if we did the calculation on
this<00:03:50.310> one<00:03:50.489> it<00:03:50.610> would<00:03:50.730> been<00:03:50.880> six<00:03:51.209> times<00:03:52.280> 4240

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
this one it would been six times 4240

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.729 
this one it would been six times 4240
that's<00:03:53.880> pretty<00:03:54.209> close<00:03:54.420> to<00:03:54.750> what<00:03:55.170> we<00:03:55.200> got<00:03:55.320> and

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
that's pretty close to what we got and

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.650 
that's pretty close to what we got and
that<00:03:55.799> should<00:03:56.220> be<00:03:56.310> considered<00:03:56.790> a<00:03:56.820> minimum<00:03:57.420> for

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
that should be considered a minimum for

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.539 
that should be considered a minimum for
wide<00:03:57.840> open<00:03:58.080> throttle<00:03:58.260> so<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.250> technician

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
wide open throttle so the technician

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.030 
wide open throttle so the technician
