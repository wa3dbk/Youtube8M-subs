00:00:05.889 --> 00:00:05.899 
right I got the jumper wire in trucks

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:11.830 
right I got the jumper wire in trucks
that<00:00:06.080> an<00:00:06.229> operating<00:00:06.740> tent<00:00:10.450> start<00:00:11.450> this<00:00:11.600> thing

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:11.840 
that an operating tent start this thing

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:22.890 
that an operating tent start this thing
up

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:22.900 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.990 

okay<00:00:23.439> so<00:00:23.500> that<00:00:23.800> signifies<00:00:24.670> it's<00:00:24.910> a

okay so that signifies it's a

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:39.590 
okay so that signifies it's a
six-cylinder

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.380 

it's<00:00:39.900> doing<00:00:40.200> its<00:00:40.350> day

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
it's doing its day

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.270 
it's doing its day
I<00:00:42.420> believe<00:00:43.020> when<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.260> flashes<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.829> go<00:00:44.010> left

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
I believe when it flashes I go left

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.220 
I believe when it flashes I go left
right<00:00:44.550> on<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.760> steering<00:00:45.030> wheel<00:00:45.120> brake<00:00:45.899> pedal

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
right on the steering wheel brake pedal

right on the steering wheel brake pedal
dousset<00:00:46.770> if<00:00:47.550> i<00:00:47.879> am<00:00:48.199> correct

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.420 

the<00:00:55.270> flash<00:00:55.540> wants<00:00:55.990> wants<00:00:56.560> the<00:00:56.740> idol<00:00:57.040> dies<00:00:57.220> down

the flash wants wants the idol dies down

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:27.499 
the flash wants wants the idol dies down
here<00:00:57.730> in<00:00:57.820> the<00:00:57.880> second<00:00:58.270> company

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.130 

left-right<00:01:28.780> great<00:01:29.020> petal<00:01:29.409> pieces<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:32.020> then

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
left-right great petal pieces and then

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:43.550 
left-right great petal pieces and then
flashes<00:01:32.560> like<00:01:32.710> that<00:01:32.920> once<00:01:34.829> 1<00:01:36.689> 1<00:01:37.689> 2<00:01:38.289> 3<00:01:38.820> 4<00:01:39.820> 5<00:01:40.630> 6<00:01:41.500> 7<00:01:42.250> 1

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
flashes like that once 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:52.710 
flashes like that once 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1
2<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:45.640> then<00:01:45.729> are<00:01:45.909> repeated<00:01:46.360> again<00:01:47.789> 1<00:01:49.770> 1<00:01:50.770> 2<00:01:51.369> 3<00:01:52.060> 4

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
2 and then are repeated again 1 1 2 3 4

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.830 
2 and then are repeated again 1 1 2 3 4
5<00:01:53.590> C<00:01:54.390> set

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
5 C set

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.139 
5 C set
on<00:01:57.470> two

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
on two

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:07.940 
on two
that's<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.750> 172<00:02:01.530> code<00:02:01.770> correct<00:02:04.549> also<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:06.920> shut<00:02:07.920> it

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
that's a 172 code correct also I shut it

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.360 
that's a 172 code correct also I shut it
off<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.239> just<00:02:09.479> did<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.750> key<00:02:10.019> on<00:02:10.289> engine<00:02:10.860> off

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
off and I just did a key on engine off

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:21.809 
off and I just did a key on engine off
test<00:02:12.260> see<00:02:13.260> if<00:02:13.379> it<00:02:13.470> doesn't<00:02:17.239> okay

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:29.580 

relays<00:02:22.510> clicked<00:02:24.390> don't<00:02:25.390> count<00:02:25.599> that<00:02:25.689> one<00:02:26.819> 1<00:02:28.590> 2

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
relays clicked don't count that one 1 2

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:40.220 
relays clicked don't count that one 1 2
3<00:02:32.189> then<00:02:33.189> you<00:02:33.250> got<00:02:33.430> a<00:02:33.459> little<00:02:33.610> pause<00:02:34.290> 1<00:02:35.849> 2<00:02:36.849> 3

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:48.869 

better<00:02:41.230> repeats

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:55.920 

I<00:02:48.909> think<00:02:49.719> it's<00:02:49.840> going<00:02:50.019> to<00:02:50.109> see<00:02:50.319> mo<00:02:53.040> see<00:02:54.180> on<00:02:55.180> two

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
I think it's going to see mo see on two

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:02.339 
I think it's going to see mo see on two
three<00:02:57.780> one<00:02:58.780> two<00:02:59.499> three<00:03:00.209> four<00:03:01.209> that's<00:03:02.019> a<00:03:02.170> three

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
three one two three four that's a three

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.009 
three one two three four that's a three
three<00:03:02.469> four<00:03:02.739> Co<00:03:02.950> so<00:03:03.010> I<00:03:03.129> mean<00:03:03.310> a<00:03:03.340> three<00:03:03.670> three

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.309 

getting<00:03:08.019> a<00:03:08.049> 33<00:03:09.389> for<00:03:10.389> the<00:03:10.480> first<00:03:10.719> codes<00:03:11.019> and

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
getting a 33 for the first codes and

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.099 
getting a 33 for the first codes and
then<00:03:11.469> three<00:03:12.010> three<00:03:12.370> four<00:03:12.879> on<00:03:13.269> the<00:03:13.599> next<00:03:13.930> set<00:03:14.079> of

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109 
then three three four on the next set of

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:20.879 
then three three four on the next set of
codes<00:03:14.409> and<00:03:16.650> that's<00:03:17.650> all<00:03:17.829> I'm<00:03:17.919> getting<00:03:19.889> so

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
codes and that's all I'm getting so

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:22.559 
codes and that's all I'm getting so
correct<00:03:21.219> me<00:03:21.310> if<00:03:21.549> I'm<00:03:21.700> doing<00:03:22.000> anything<00:03:22.239> wrong
