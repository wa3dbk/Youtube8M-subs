was<00:02:08.270> intuitive<00:02:08.600> response<00:02:09.110> have<00:02:09.560> been

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
was intuitive response have been

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.860 
was intuitive response have been
satisfying<00:02:10.340> it<00:02:10.880> wasn't<00:02:11.210> those<00:02:11.330> three<00:02:11.600> things

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870

and<00:02:12.200> it<00:02:12.260> was<00:02:12.380> moved<00:02:13.340> it<00:02:13.490> to<00:02:13.580> a<00:02:13.610> button<00:02:13.940> you<00:02:14.270> know

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
and it was moved it to a button you know

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.480 
and it was moved it to a button you know
the<00:02:15.170> responsiveness<00:02:15.800> in<00:02:16.010> this<00:02:16.130> kind<00:02:16.310> of<00:02:16.370> game

the responsiveness in this kind of game

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.400 
the responsiveness in this kind of game
is<00:02:16.670> so<00:02:16.910> important<00:02:17.570> that<00:02:17.900> we<00:02:18.020> wanted<00:02:18.260> to<00:02:18.320> make

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
is so important that we wanted to make

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
sure that everything every gesture that

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:20.980 
sure that everything every gesture that
we<00:02:19.880> did<00:02:20.000> it<00:02:20.090> wasn't<00:02:20.390> a<00:02:20.420> gimmick<00:02:20.600> it<00:02:20.870> was

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
the shop so we added a spin move so if

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.900 
the shop so we added a spin move so if
you<00:03:00.680> see<00:03:00.860> somebody<00:03:01.070> coming<00:03:01.190> at<00:03:01.489> you<00:03:01.700> and<00:03:01.820> they
