00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
the south end of Chatham Strait and with

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.860 
the south end of Chatham Strait and with
the<00:05:22.840> wind<00:05:23.050> blowing<00:05:23.700> as<00:05:24.700> it<00:05:24.820> was<00:05:24.940> predicted<00:05:25.120> it

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
the wind blowing as it was predicted it

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.540 
the wind blowing as it was predicted it
might<00:05:26.140> have<00:05:26.260> been<00:05:26.380> a<00:05:26.440> little<00:05:26.680> rough<00:05:26.830> so<00:05:27.190> we

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
might have been a little rough so we

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.370 
might have been a little rough so we
decided<00:05:27.880> to<00:05:28.000> wait<00:05:28.120> till<00:05:28.330> tomorrow<00:05:28.570> when<00:05:29.260> the

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
decided to wait till tomorrow when the

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:30.800 
decided to wait till tomorrow when the
winds<00:05:29.650> are<00:05:29.770> supposed<00:05:29.980> to<00:05:30.010> be<00:05:30.130> light<00:05:30.400> and

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
winds are supposed to be light and

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.860 
winds are supposed to be light and
turning<00:05:31.810> south<00:05:33.270> so<00:05:34.270> that<00:05:34.300> would<00:05:34.570> give<00:05:34.690> us<00:05:34.780> a

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
turning south so that would give us a

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.360 
turning south so that would give us a
little<00:05:35.050> boost<00:05:35.230> going<00:05:35.470> up<00:05:35.800> we're<00:05:36.100> not<00:05:36.130> going

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
little boost going up we're not going

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.190 
little boost going up we're not going
that<00:05:36.580> far<00:05:36.910> only<00:05:37.330> important<00:05:37.660> Alexander

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.200 
that far only important Alexander

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.100 
that far only important Alexander
because<00:05:38.920> we<00:05:39.070> need<00:05:39.250> fuel<00:05:39.520> but<00:05:40.300> that<00:05:40.480> point<00:05:40.870> is

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
because we need fuel but that point is

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.410 
because we need fuel but that point is
supposedly<00:05:41.650> just<00:05:42.430> a<00:05:42.580> little<00:05:42.820> rough<00:05:43.060> if<00:05:43.270> you

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:43.420 
supposedly just a little rough if you

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.690 
supposedly just a little rough if you
capture<00:05:43.870> the<00:05:44.470> point<00:05:44.710> can<00:05:44.890> get<00:05:45.010> boisterous<00:05:45.520> at

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 
capture the point can get boisterous at

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.400 
capture the point can get boisterous at
time<00:05:45.910> so<00:05:46.300> we<00:05:46.450> wanted<00:05:46.720> to<00:05:46.810> make<00:05:46.930> sure<00:05:47.110> that<00:05:47.290> we

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
time so we wanted to make sure that we

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:48.870 
time so we wanted to make sure that we
had<00:05:47.530> the<00:05:47.680> best<00:05:47.830> possible<00:05:48.070> weather<00:05:48.460> so<00:05:48.700> that's

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
had the best possible weather so that's

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.030 
had the best possible weather so that's
what<00:05:49.000> we<00:05:49.090> did<00:05:49.240> and<00:05:49.500> decided<00:05:50.500> to<00:05:50.560> stay<00:05:50.770> an<00:05:50.950> extra

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:51.040 
what we did and decided to stay an extra

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:57.540 
what we did and decided to stay an extra
day<00:05:51.280> so<00:05:55.620> we<00:05:56.620> are<00:05:56.770> right<00:05:56.980> at<00:05:57.040> the<00:05:57.100> mouth<00:05:57.310> of<00:05:57.490> a
