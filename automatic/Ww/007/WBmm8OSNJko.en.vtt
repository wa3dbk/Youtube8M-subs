originally<00:01:09.229> when<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.260> got<00:01:10.590> one<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.860> these

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
originally when I got one of these

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.899 
originally when I got one of these
probably<00:01:12.140> 2002<00:01:13.140> or<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:13.619> really<00:01:14.490> didn't<00:01:14.820> seem

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
probably 2002 or so really didn't seem

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.609 
probably 2002 or so really didn't seem
like<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.240> big<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.630> deal<00:01:15.869> at<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.140> time

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
like that big of a deal at the time

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.469 
like that big of a deal at the time

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
but you know we've been spoiled by

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.380 
but you know we've been spoiled by
backlit<00:01:19.020> screens<00:01:19.409> for<00:01:19.770> several<00:01:20.610> years<00:01:20.880> now<00:01:20.939> so

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
backlit screens for several years now so

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.440

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
it's a little tricky to really sit down

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.359 
it's a little tricky to really sit down
and<00:01:24.630> be<00:01:24.840> able<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.080> enjoy<00:01:25.320> playing<00:01:26.040> one<00:01:26.280> of

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.979 
especially when you're playing games
like<00:02:15.680> Mario<00:02:16.209> Mario<00:02:17.209> Kart<00:02:17.540> where<00:02:17.750> you've<00:02:17.840> got

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
like Mario Mario Kart where you've got

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.839 
like Mario Mario Kart where you've got
to<00:02:18.080> use<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.349> shoulder<00:02:18.680> buttons<00:02:18.860> it<00:02:19.640> can

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
to use the shoulder buttons it can

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.920 
to use the shoulder buttons it can
really<00:02:20.569> wreak<00:02:21.530> havoc<00:02:21.920> on<00:02:22.040> your<00:02:22.099> hands<00:02:22.930> it's

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
really wreak havoc on your hands it's

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.630 
really wreak havoc on your hands it's
just<00:02:24.230> not<00:02:24.440> very<00:02:24.470> comfortable<00:02:25.099> for<00:02:25.310> me<00:02:25.370> to<00:02:25.400> play

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
just not very comfortable for me to play

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.660 
just not very comfortable for me to play
now<00:02:26.330> if<00:02:26.450> you've<00:02:26.599> got<00:02:26.630> tiny<00:02:27.110> hands<00:02:27.650> or<00:02:27.800> your

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
now if you've got tiny hands or your

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:29.890 
now if you've got tiny hands or your
kids<00:02:28.940> are<00:02:29.120> playing<00:02:29.150> and<00:02:29.510> I'm<00:02:29.600> sure<00:02:29.780> they

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
kids are playing and I'm sure they

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.110 
kids are playing and I'm sure they
wouldn't<00:02:30.110> have<00:02:30.230> any<00:02:30.350> problems<00:02:30.739> but<00:02:30.950> for<00:02:31.880> me<00:02:31.970> it

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
wouldn't have any problems but for me it

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.390 
wouldn't have any problems but for me it
just<00:02:32.300> does<00:02:32.480> not<00:02:32.510> work<00:02:32.780> very<00:02:32.840> well<00:02:33.110> so

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
just does not work very well so

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.590 
just does not work very well so
unfortunately<00:02:34.400> this<00:02:34.520> is<00:02:34.730> not<00:02:34.760> a<00:02:34.940> good<00:02:35.569> option

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
unfortunately this is not a good option

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.660 
unfortunately this is not a good option
so<00:02:36.819> how<00:02:37.819> could<00:02:38.030> I<00:02:38.150> combine<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:39.459> comfort<00:02:40.459> and

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
so how could I combine the comfort and

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.960 
so how could I combine the comfort and
ergonomics<00:02:40.880> of<00:02:41.599> the<00:02:41.870> original<00:02:42.319> GBA<00:02:42.730> with<00:02:43.730> the

as<00:03:44.480> in<00:03:44.720> stop<00:03:45.079> functioning<00:03:45.620> after<00:03:45.920> it's<00:03:46.040> ages

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
as in stop functioning after it's ages

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.370 
as in stop functioning after it's ages
but<00:03:48.350> these<00:03:48.560> batteries<00:03:49.070> will<00:03:49.959> just<00:03:50.959> standard

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
but these batteries will just standard

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.020 
but these batteries will just standard
double<00:03:51.620> A's<00:03:51.769> and<00:03:52.130> just<00:03:52.400> swap<00:03:52.579> them<00:03:52.700> out<00:03:52.850> and

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
double A's and just swap them out and

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.229 
double A's and just swap them out and
and<00:03:53.269> keep<00:03:53.750> on<00:03:53.900> going<00:03:54.230> you<00:03:55.000> probably<00:03:56.000> get

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
and keep on going you probably get

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.210 
and keep on going you probably get
anywhere<00:03:56.569> in<00:03:57.170> the<00:03:57.260> range<00:03:57.500> of<00:03:57.620> about<00:03:57.769> 10<00:03:58.040> hours

one<00:04:17.720> I<00:04:17.959> would<00:04:18.769> compare<00:04:19.250> the<00:04:19.280> screens<00:04:20.000> on<00:04:20.419> the

the SP probably on its lowest setting to
what<00:04:27.910> the<00:04:28.150> screen<00:04:28.449> will<00:04:28.630> be<00:04:28.720> like<00:04:28.900> in<00:04:29.229> the

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
what the screen will be like in the

what the screen will be like in the
standard<00:04:30.280> GBA<00:04:30.610> so<00:04:31.139> you're<00:04:32.139> not<00:04:32.289> going<00:04:32.440> to<00:04:32.500> get

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
standard GBA so you're not going to get

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.240

miscellaneous parts I think a

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.310 
miscellaneous parts I think a
replacement<00:05:09.460> shell<00:05:09.849> as<00:05:10.060> well<00:05:10.090> which<00:05:10.960> is<00:05:11.139> good

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
replacement shell as well which is good

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.920 
replacement shell as well which is good
because<00:05:11.530> you<00:05:11.949> do<00:05:12.550> have<00:05:12.580> to<00:05:12.840> without<00:05:13.840> the

because you do have to without the
replacement<00:05:14.440> shell<00:05:14.650> if<00:05:15.400> you<00:05:15.580> take<00:05:15.880> an

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
replacement shell if you take an

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.749 
replacement shell if you take an
original<00:05:16.180> shell<00:05:16.630> like<00:05:16.870> this<00:05:17.199> one<00:05:17.490> you<00:05:18.490> do<00:05:18.729> have

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:18.759 
original shell like this one you do have

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:20.999 
original shell like this one you do have
to<00:05:19.090> do<00:05:19.210> some<00:05:19.419> drilling<00:05:19.990> and<00:05:20.199> hacking<00:05:20.650> to<00:05:20.860> get

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:21.009 
to do some drilling and hacking to get

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:24.300 
to do some drilling and hacking to get
the<00:05:21.160> screen<00:05:21.460> to<00:05:21.610> fit<00:05:21.849> just<00:05:22.120> right<00:05:22.889> so<00:05:23.889> keep

the screen to fit just right so keep

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.010

that<00:05:24.520> in<00:05:24.580> mind<00:05:24.699> it<00:05:25.180> can<00:05:25.330> be<00:05:25.449> a<00:05:25.479> little<00:05:25.750> bit<00:05:25.870> more

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020
