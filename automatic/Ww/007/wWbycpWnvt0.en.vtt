hi everyone welcome to the tutorial what
I'm<00:00:03.120> looking<00:00:03.389> at<00:00:03.449> today<00:00:03.750> is<00:00:04.049> using<00:00:04.410> Ableton's

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
I'm looking at today is using Ableton's

I'm looking at today is using Ableton's
multiband<00:00:05.910> dynamics<00:00:05.970> to<00:00:06.660> process<00:00:07.319> old<00:00:08.210> jungle

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
multiband dynamics to process old jungle

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.850 
multiband dynamics to process old jungle
breaks<00:00:09.510> and<00:00:09.750> just<00:00:09.780> tighten<00:00:10.110> them<00:00:10.290> up<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.650> go

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
breaks and just tighten them up and go

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:19.220 
breaks and just tighten them up and go
from<00:00:11.099> something<00:00:11.550> like<00:00:12.000> this<00:00:14.690> to<00:00:15.690> this<00:00:18.199> so<00:00:19.199> you

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
from something like this to this so you

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.599 
from something like this to this so you
can<00:00:19.350> here's<00:00:19.500> got<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.680> much<00:00:19.859> fuller<00:00:20.070> tighter

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
can here's got a much fuller tighter

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.300 
can here's got a much fuller tighter
sound<00:00:21.230> tense<00:00:22.230> uses<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.650> lot<00:00:22.949> when<00:00:23.070> I'm<00:00:23.130> doing

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
sound tense uses a lot when I'm doing

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.560 
sound tense uses a lot when I'm doing
drum<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.609> bass<00:00:23.730> kind<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.150> stuff<00:00:24.330> but<00:00:24.510> you

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
drum and bass kind of stuff but you

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.179 
drum and bass kind of stuff but you
could<00:00:24.750> apply<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:25.019> anything<00:00:25.350> we're<00:00:25.619> using<00:00:25.830> kind

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
could apply to anything we're using kind

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.630 
could apply to anything we're using kind
of<00:00:26.279> sampled<00:00:27.109> break<00:00:28.109> beats<00:00:28.380> or<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:29.369> know<00:00:29.460> any

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
of sampled break beats or you know any

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.420 
of sampled break beats or you know any
kind<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:29.970> drum<00:00:30.150> loop<00:00:30.330> really<00:00:30.949> so<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.070> sample

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
kind of drum loop really so the sample

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.510 
kind of drum loop really so the sample
is<00:00:32.520> from<00:00:32.840> a<00:00:33.840> free<00:00:34.649> sample<00:00:34.860> pack<00:00:35.100> actually<00:00:35.430> I'll

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
is from a free sample pack actually I'll

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.069 
is from a free sample pack actually I'll
put<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.760> link<00:00:35.969> up<00:00:36.180> it's<00:00:36.360> bloom<00:00:36.719> or<00:00:36.870> ten

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
put the link up it's bloom or ten

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.590 
put the link up it's bloom or ten
released<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.590> just<00:00:37.770> loads<00:00:38.040> of<00:00:38.420> samples<00:00:39.420> from

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
released it just loads of samples from

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.930 
released it just loads of samples from
older<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.110> jungle<00:00:40.559> records<00:00:40.950> really<00:00:41.820> worth

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
older a jungle records really worth

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.880 
older a jungle records really worth
getting<00:00:42.210> but<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.200> first<00:00:43.440> thing<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:43.649> notice

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
getting but the first thing I notice

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.990 
getting but the first thing I notice
with<00:00:44.010> this<00:00:44.160> break<00:00:46.160> it's<00:00:47.160> quite<00:00:47.520> loose<00:00:47.789> it's

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
with this break it's quite loose it's

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.670 
with this break it's quite loose it's
got<00:00:48.120> lots<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.420> our<00:00:48.570> high-end<00:00:48.840> wash<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.530> just

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
got lots of our high-end wash and I just

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.110 
got lots of our high-end wash and I just
want<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.860> give<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.129> slightly<00:00:50.280> tighter<00:00:50.760> sound

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
want to give it a slightly tighter sound

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.209 
want to give it a slightly tighter sound
so<00:00:51.480> have<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.260> look<00:00:52.440> at<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.590> channel<00:00:52.860> strip<00:00:52.980> then

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
so have a look at the channel strip then

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.770 
so have a look at the channel strip then
what<00:00:53.370> I'm<00:00:53.460> going<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.640> be<00:00:53.760> using<00:00:53.969> mainly<00:00:54.480> is<00:00:54.660> the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
what I'm going to be using mainly is the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.110 
what I'm going to be using mainly is the
multiband<00:00:55.199> dynamics<00:00:55.399> I've<00:00:56.399> got<00:00:56.730> an<00:00:56.789> EQ

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
multiband dynamics I've got an EQ

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.849 
multiband dynamics I've got an EQ
compressor<00:00:57.480> saturated<00:00:58.199> which<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.410> have<00:00:58.590> by

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
compressor saturated which I have by

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.979 
compressor saturated which I have by
default<00:00:59.430> on<00:00:59.640> any<00:01:00.030> every<00:01:00.390> channel<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.870> can

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
default on any every channel you can

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.229 
default on any every channel you can
just<00:01:01.199> right<00:01:01.440> click<00:01:01.469> in<00:01:01.829> live<00:01:02.039> 9<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.520> says

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
just right click in live 9 and says

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.690 
just right click in live 9 and says
default<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:03.930> do<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:04.290> because<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.949> tend<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.460> use

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
default I do this because I tend to use

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.109 
default I do this because I tend to use
these<00:01:06.710> devices<00:01:07.710> all<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.189> time<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:08.909> it's<00:01:09.000> just

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
these devices all the time so it's just

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.390 
these devices all the time so it's just
quicker<00:01:09.479> for<00:01:09.869> me<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.140> just<00:01:10.320> access<00:01:10.710> them<00:01:10.920> so

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
quicker for me to just access them so

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.620 
quicker for me to just access them so
first<00:01:11.640> thing<00:01:11.760> I'm<00:01:11.909> going<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.150> do<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.450> just

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
first thing I'm going to do is just

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.249 
first thing I'm going to do is just
actually<00:01:12.960> wear<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.409> EQ<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.880> want<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.659> pull

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
actually wear the EQ and I want to pull

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.550 
actually wear the EQ and I want to pull
the<00:01:16.380> kick<00:01:16.590> drum<00:01:16.770> out<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.920> little<00:01:17.100> bit<00:01:18.259> so<00:01:19.259> I'm

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
the kick drum out a little bit so I'm

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.530 
the kick drum out a little bit so I'm
just<00:01:19.740> going<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:19.979> go<00:01:20.130> for<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.700> belt<00:01:21.119> filters

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
just going to go for the belt filters

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.450 
just going to go for the belt filters
and<00:01:21.689> when<00:01:21.780> use<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.020> audition<00:01:22.439> mode<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:23.220> what

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
and when use the audition mode and what

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.940 
and when use the audition mode and what
this<00:01:23.549> will<00:01:23.700> let<00:01:23.790> me<00:01:23.850> do<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.119> really<00:01:24.390> focus<00:01:25.229> on

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
this will let me do is really focus on

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.630 
this will let me do is really focus on
the<00:01:26.939> kick<00:01:27.119> drum<00:01:27.150> just<00:01:27.920> hold<00:01:28.920> down<00:01:28.979> alt<00:01:29.280> up<00:01:29.460> and

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
the kick drum just hold down alt up and

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.569 
the kick drum just hold down alt up and
tighten<00:01:29.909> up<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.119> cue<00:01:34.100> I'm<00:01:35.100> going<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.340> pull<00:01:35.490> the

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
tighten up the cue I'm going to pull the

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.679 
tighten up the cue I'm going to pull the
gate<00:01:35.759> down<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:35.970> bit<00:01:37.939> okay<00:01:38.939> that's<00:01:39.210> okay<00:01:39.360> for<00:01:39.570> now

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
gate down a bit okay that's okay for now

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:40.760 
gate down a bit okay that's okay for now
I'll<00:01:39.840> probably<00:01:39.990> combat<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:40.439> later<00:01:40.680> on

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
I'll probably combat this later on

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.080 
I'll probably combat this later on
because<00:01:41.220> what<00:01:41.549> I'm<00:01:41.610> going<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.790> do<00:01:41.909> with<00:01:42.060> a

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
because what I'm going to do with a

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.090 
because what I'm going to do with a
dynamic<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.750> multiband<00:01:43.320> dynamics<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.860> going<00:01:44.040> to

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
dynamic a multiband dynamics is going to

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.440 
dynamic a multiband dynamics is going to
change<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.460> quite<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.700> bit<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.060> I'll<00:01:45.180> wait<00:01:45.299> and

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
change it quite a bit so I'll wait and

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.840 
change it quite a bit so I'll wait and
see<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:45.899> might<00:01:46.649> give<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:47.009> bit<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.189> drivers

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
see I might give it a bit of drivers

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.550 
see I might give it a bit of drivers
won't<00:01:48.119> turn<00:01:48.540> soft<00:01:48.840> clipping<00:01:49.110> on<00:01:51.320> okay<00:01:52.320> that's

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
won't turn soft clipping on okay that's

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.120 
won't turn soft clipping on okay that's
enough<00:01:52.799> for<00:01:52.829> now

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
enough for now

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.160 
enough for now
don't<00:01:53.549> overdo<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.119> down<00:01:54.360> here<00:01:54.600> because<00:01:54.930> here

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
don't overdo it down here because here

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.810 
don't overdo it down here because here
like<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.409> said<00:01:55.590> multiphone<00:01:56.009> dynamics<00:01:56.549> is<00:01:56.640> where

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
like I said multiphone dynamics is where

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.240 
like I said multiphone dynamics is where
I'm<00:01:56.909> really<00:01:57.270> going<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.540> do<00:01:57.630> all<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.810> work<00:01:57.930> so

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
I'm really going to do all the work so

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.149 
I'm really going to do all the work so
pull<00:01:59.250> them<00:01:59.369> all<00:01:59.490> spun<00:01:59.670> dynamics<00:02:00.119> in<00:02:01.040> so<00:02:02.040> this

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
pull them all spun dynamics in so this

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.969 
pull them all spun dynamics in so this
is<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.340> really<00:02:02.579> really<00:02:02.850> good<00:02:03.570> plugin<00:02:04.140> arm<00:02:04.350> I

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
is a really really good plugin arm I

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.069 
is a really really good plugin arm I
mean<00:02:05.670> in<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.939> manual<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:06.420> talks<00:02:06.659> about<00:02:06.780> being

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
mean in the manual it talks about being

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.869 
mean in the manual it talks about being
used<00:02:07.380> for<00:02:07.530> mastering<00:02:08.039> which<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.399> fine<00:02:08.610> but

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
used for mastering which is fine but

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.020 
used for mastering which is fine but
it's<00:02:09.030> actually<00:02:09.330> really<00:02:09.569> good<00:02:09.780> way<00:02:09.959> of<00:02:11.030> editing

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
it's actually really good way of editing

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.809 
it's actually really good way of editing
and<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.629> know<00:02:12.750> kind<00:02:12.989> of<00:02:13.020> refix<00:02:13.470> in

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
and you know kind of refix in

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.369 
and you know kind of refix in
audio<00:02:15.819> especially<00:02:16.480> stuff<00:02:16.959> like<00:02:17.049> this<00:02:17.170> that's

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
audio especially stuff like this that's

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:18.809 
audio especially stuff like this that's
like<00:02:17.500> a<00:02:17.709> drum<00:02:17.980> loop<00:02:18.159> that's<00:02:18.340> got<00:02:18.489> lots<00:02:18.640> of

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
like a drum loop that's got lots of

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.880 
like a drum loop that's got lots of
different<00:02:19.120> frequencies<00:02:19.299> like<00:02:19.719> low<00:02:20.409> mid<00:02:20.739> and

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
different frequencies like low mid and

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.890 
different frequencies like low mid and
iron<00:02:21.219> and<00:02:21.370> this<00:02:21.519> is<00:02:21.760> actually<00:02:22.060> capable<00:02:22.689> of

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
iron and this is actually capable of

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.360 
iron and this is actually capable of
working<00:02:23.079> with<00:02:23.409> three<00:02:23.590> bands<00:02:23.829> who<00:02:24.040> have<00:02:24.219> low

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
working with three bands who have low

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.479 
working with three bands who have low
mid<00:02:24.519> in<00:02:24.609> height<00:02:24.760> it's<00:02:25.000> really<00:02:25.329> good<00:02:25.480> for<00:02:25.659> this

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
mid in height it's really good for this

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.860 
mid in height it's really good for this
what<00:02:27.489> is<00:02:27.640> it<00:02:27.819> it's<00:02:27.969> actually<00:02:28.120> it's<00:02:28.780> a

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
what is it it's actually it's a

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.050 
what is it it's actually it's a
compressor<00:02:29.500> and<00:02:29.680> an<00:02:30.129> expander<00:02:30.730> but<00:02:30.879> what's

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
compressor and an expander but what's

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.030 
compressor and an expander but what's
really<00:02:31.450> useful<00:02:31.629> with<00:02:31.959> it<00:02:31.989> is<00:02:32.230> it<00:02:32.560> can<00:02:32.709> do<00:02:32.829> both

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
really useful with it is it can do both

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.849 
really useful with it is it can do both
upward<00:02:33.400> and<00:02:33.909> downward<00:02:34.709> compression<00:02:35.709> and

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:35.859 
upward and downward compression and

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:37.709 
upward and downward compression and
expansion<00:02:36.189> so<00:02:36.819> just<00:02:37.120> to<00:02:37.209> give<00:02:37.359> you<00:02:37.420> an<00:02:37.480> example

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:37.719 
expansion so just to give you an example

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:40.319 
expansion so just to give you an example
that<00:02:37.900> means<00:02:38.260> but<00:02:39.129> focus<00:02:39.489> on<00:02:39.609> the<00:02:39.670> high<00:02:39.879> end<00:02:39.909> now

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
that means but focus on the high end now

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:43.339 
that means but focus on the high end now
to<00:02:40.389> solo<00:02:40.810> it<00:02:41.049> I<00:02:41.790> could<00:02:42.790> do<00:02:42.909> downward

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
to solo it I could do downward

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.039 
to solo it I could do downward
compression<00:02:44.579> by<00:02:45.579> say<00:02:46.000> my<00:02:46.150> threshold<00:02:46.389> here<00:02:46.810> and

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
compression by say my threshold here and

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.679 
compression by say my threshold here and
then<00:02:47.230> pulling<00:02:47.709> down<00:02:48.669> and<00:02:48.939> we<00:02:49.150> can<00:02:49.329> hear<00:02:49.540> them

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:49.689 
then pulling down and we can hear them

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:54.629 
then pulling down and we can hear them
squashing<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:51.870> high<00:02:52.870> end<00:02:53.109> I<00:02:53.319> could<00:02:54.310> go<00:02:54.519> the

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:54.639 
squashing the high end I could go the

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:57.000 
squashing the high end I could go the
other<00:02:54.730> way<00:02:54.849> and<00:02:55.180> do<00:02:55.480> expansion<00:02:56.109> and<00:02:56.859> you'll

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
other way and do expansion and you'll

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.289 
other way and do expansion and you'll
see<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.370> difference<00:02:57.700> in<00:02:57.849> the<00:02:57.909> little<00:02:58.120> meet

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
see the difference in the little meet

00:02:58.299 --> 00:02:59.819 
see the difference in the little meet
the<00:02:58.419> little<00:02:58.659> bars<00:02:58.900> day<00:02:59.169> we<00:02:59.319> see<00:02:59.469> the<00:02:59.560> orange

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
the little bars day we see the orange

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.179 
the little bars day we see the orange
bar<00:03:00.010> that<00:03:00.280> we<00:03:00.370> gather<00:03:00.549> bar<00:03:00.760> so<00:03:01.209> the<00:03:01.889> yellow<00:03:02.889> bar

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:03.189 
bar that we gather bar so the yellow bar

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:05.190 
bar that we gather bar so the yellow bar
represents<00:03:03.519> the<00:03:04.030> input<00:03:04.359> signal<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:04.930> orange

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
represents the input signal the orange

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.080 
represents the input signal the orange
bar<00:03:05.500> represents<00:03:06.069> the<00:03:06.129> output<00:03:06.639> signal<00:03:06.969> so<00:03:07.060> we

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
bar represents the output signal so we

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.929 
bar represents the output signal so we
can<00:03:07.150> see<00:03:07.419> we're<00:03:07.629> making<00:03:08.620> it<00:03:08.739> louder<00:03:08.980> than<00:03:09.639> the

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:09.939 
can see we're making it louder than the

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:11.309 
can see we're making it louder than the
original<00:03:10.510> input<00:03:10.689> signal<00:03:11.169> where's

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
original input signal where's

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.949 
original input signal where's
compression<00:03:11.950> puts<00:03:12.790> a<00:03:12.879> gap<00:03:13.060> between<00:03:13.209> it<00:03:13.569> so<00:03:13.599> the

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
compression puts a gap between it so the

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.339 
compression puts a gap between it so the
output<00:03:14.469> is<00:03:14.500> actually<00:03:14.769> quite<00:03:14.950> er<00:03:14.980> than<00:03:15.459> the

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
output is actually quite er than the

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:22.379 
output is actually quite er than the
input<00:03:17.349> signal<00:03:19.379> okay<00:03:20.669> so<00:03:21.669> that's<00:03:21.849> upwards<00:03:22.060> and

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:22.389 
input signal okay so that's upwards and

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:23.969 
input signal okay so that's upwards and
downwards<00:03:22.449> compression<00:03:23.319> but<00:03:23.440> then<00:03:23.590> at<00:03:23.949> the

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:23.979 
downwards compression but then at the

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:26.520 
downwards compression but then at the
bottom<00:03:24.190> here<00:03:24.459> we<00:03:24.579> can<00:03:24.729> work<00:03:24.970> with<00:03:25.359> so<00:03:26.290> that's<00:03:26.409> a

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
bottom here we can work with so that's a

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.409 
bottom here we can work with so that's a
bit<00:03:26.709> of<00:03:26.739> downwards<00:03:27.159> expansion<00:03:27.819> sorry<00:03:28.060> so<00:03:28.299> what

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:28.419 
bit of downwards expansion sorry so what

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:32.990 
bit of downwards expansion sorry so what
we<00:03:28.540> can<00:03:28.690> do<00:03:29.079> here<00:03:29.470> is<00:03:29.769> we<00:03:30.639> can<00:03:31.449> do<00:03:31.629> some<00:03:31.959> upwards

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
we can do here is we can do some upwards

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.640 
we can do here is we can do some upwards
compression<00:03:34.000> so<00:03:34.540> weapons<00:03:34.689> now<00:03:35.019> as<00:03:35.169> I<00:03:35.290> set<00:03:35.560> the

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
compression so weapons now as I set the

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.460 
compression so weapons now as I set the
threshold<00:03:36.159> around<00:03:37.060> here<00:03:37.540> and<00:03:37.629> if<00:03:37.750> I<00:03:37.870> drag<00:03:38.169> up

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
threshold around here and if I drag up

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.369 
threshold around here and if I drag up
I'm<00:03:38.680> making<00:03:39.099> the<00:03:39.220> signals<00:03:40.260> underneath<00:03:41.260> the

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:41.379 
I'm making the signals underneath the

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:43.530 
I'm making the signals underneath the
threshold<00:03:41.620> louder<00:03:42.069> so<00:03:42.879> that's<00:03:43.030> that's<00:03:43.239> booked

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
threshold louder so that's that's booked

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.939 
threshold louder so that's that's booked
with<00:03:43.720> compression<00:03:44.199> because<00:03:44.319> it's<00:03:44.530> it's<00:03:44.769> still

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:44.949 
with compression because it's it's still

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:46.530 
with compression because it's it's still
compressing<00:03:45.519> it's<00:03:45.699> reducing<00:03:46.269> the<00:03:46.359> dynamic

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
compressing it's reducing the dynamic

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.969 
compressing it's reducing the dynamic
range<00:03:47.699> whereas<00:03:48.699> this<00:03:49.449> way<00:03:49.689> was<00:03:50.169> downwards

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:50.979 
range whereas this way was downwards

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:52.439 
range whereas this way was downwards
compression<00:03:51.430> it<00:03:51.549> was<00:03:51.699> making<00:03:52.180> a<00:03:52.239> louder

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:52.449 
compression it was making a louder

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:56.939 
compression it was making a louder
signals<00:03:52.870> quieter<00:03:55.439> but<00:03:56.439> the<00:03:56.560> really<00:03:56.799> useful

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:56.949 
signals quieter but the really useful

00:03:56.949 --> 00:04:01.099 
signals quieter but the really useful
thing<00:03:57.280> I<00:03:57.459> like<00:03:58.030> the<00:03:58.150> most<00:03:58.359> is<00:03:58.810> doing<00:03:59.500> the

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
thing I like the most is doing the

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.809 
thing I like the most is doing the
downwards<00:04:02.129> expansion<00:04:03.129> and<00:04:03.250> what<00:04:03.340> this<00:04:03.489> does

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
downwards expansion and what this does

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:07.259 
downwards expansion and what this does
is<00:04:04.090> any<00:04:04.750> signal<00:04:05.470> below<00:04:05.889> the<00:04:06.220> threshold<00:04:06.400> it

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
is any signal below the threshold it

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:08.909 
is any signal below the threshold it
actually<00:04:07.599> makes<00:04:07.750> it<00:04:07.870> quieter<00:04:08.109> but<00:04:08.620> you<00:04:08.709> can

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:08.919 
actually makes it quieter but you can

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:11.849 
actually makes it quieter but you can
adjust<00:04:09.310> how<00:04:09.579> quiet<00:04:10.449> it<00:04:10.599> is<00:04:10.780> and<00:04:11.079> this<00:04:11.650> gives

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
adjust how quiet it is and this gives

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:14.159 
adjust how quiet it is and this gives
you<00:04:11.979> almost<00:04:12.189> like<00:04:12.430> a<00:04:12.549> gated<00:04:13.090> sound<00:04:13.419> but<00:04:13.989> it's<00:04:14.109> a

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:14.169 
you almost like a gated sound but it's a

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:15.539 
you almost like a gated sound but it's a
little<00:04:14.349> bit<00:04:14.470> smoother<00:04:14.889> and<00:04:15.099> because<00:04:15.459> you've

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
little bit smoother and because you've

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:17.849 
little bit smoother and because you've
got<00:04:15.699> three<00:04:15.939> frequency<00:04:16.479> bands<00:04:16.690> then<00:04:17.139> you<00:04:17.560> can

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
got three frequency bands then you can

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.310 
got three frequency bands then you can
get<00:04:18.009> some<00:04:18.190> really<00:04:18.370> interesting<00:04:18.459> results<00:04:19.320> so

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
get some really interesting results so

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.279 
get some really interesting results so
let's<00:04:20.620> just<00:04:20.799> take<00:04:20.949> this<00:04:21.009> off<00:04:21.310> solo<00:04:21.990> and<00:04:22.990> what

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
let's just take this off solo and what

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:26.370 
let's just take this off solo and what
I'm<00:04:23.349> going<00:04:23.469> to<00:04:23.529> do<00:04:23.710> is<00:04:24.539> first<00:04:25.539> of<00:04:25.750> all<00:04:25.900> set<00:04:26.349> the

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
I'm going to do is first of all set the

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.680 
I'm going to do is first of all set the
threshold<00:04:26.860> for<00:04:27.070> the<00:04:27.130> high

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
threshold for the high

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.629 
threshold for the high
so<00:04:28.690> high<00:04:28.840> and<00:04:29.020> I<00:04:29.050> want<00:04:29.229> to<00:04:29.319> really<00:04:29.800> tighten<00:04:30.370> up

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
so high and I want to really tighten up

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.270 
so high and I want to really tighten up
a<00:04:30.759> little<00:04:30.789> bit<00:04:31.800> I'll<00:04:32.800> probably<00:04:32.979> do<00:04:33.129> the<00:04:33.220> same

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
a little bit I'll probably do the same

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.420 
a little bit I'll probably do the same
down<00:04:33.610> here<00:04:33.639> you<00:04:34.330> can<00:04:34.509> actually<00:04:34.659> use<00:04:35.430> you

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
down here you can actually use you

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.070 
down here you can actually use you
can<00:04:36.669> drag<00:04:37.030> them<00:04:37.150> all<00:04:37.300> at<00:04:37.360> the<00:04:37.419> same<00:04:37.509> time<00:04:37.659> which

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
can drag them all at the same time which

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.680 
can drag them all at the same time which
is<00:04:38.229> cool<00:04:38.830> and<00:04:39.069> then<00:04:39.759> I'll<00:04:39.879> start<00:04:40.180> pulling<00:04:40.569> down

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
is cool and then I'll start pulling down

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.600 
is cool and then I'll start pulling down
so<00:04:41.080> I'm<00:04:41.139> doing<00:04:41.289> downward<00:04:41.860> expansion<00:04:42.460> on<00:04:42.580> the

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
so I'm doing downward expansion on the

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.649 
so I'm doing downward expansion on the
top<00:04:42.849> end<00:04:44.699> and<00:04:45.699> we<00:04:45.789> can<00:04:45.819> hear<00:04:46.120> already<00:04:46.360> it's<00:04:46.539> got

00:04:46.649 --> 00:04:46.659 
top end and we can hear already it's got

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:48.059 
top end and we can hear already it's got
a<00:04:46.690> slightly<00:04:46.960> gated<00:04:47.379> sound<00:04:47.590> but<00:04:47.740> it's<00:04:47.860> not<00:04:47.979> as

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:48.069 
a slightly gated sound but it's not as

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:49.320 
a slightly gated sound but it's not as
harsh<00:04:48.280> as<00:04:48.460> it<00:04:48.520> get<00:04:48.699> your<00:04:48.819> gait<00:04:49.000> can<00:04:49.210> almost

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
harsh as it get your gait can almost

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.899 
harsh as it get your gait can almost
have<00:04:49.569> a<00:04:49.629> very<00:04:49.780> on/off<00:04:50.340> effect<00:04:51.340> depending<00:04:51.789> on

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:51.909 
have a very on/off effect depending on

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:54.950 
have a very on/off effect depending on
your<00:04:52.180> you<00:04:52.449> know<00:04:52.539> tack<00:04:52.780> and<00:04:52.900> release<00:04:53.169> stains

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
your you know tack and release stains

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.490 
your you know tack and release stains
okay<00:04:55.960> let's<00:04:56.169> do<00:04:56.289> the<00:04:56.379> same<00:04:56.590> with<00:04:56.650> a<00:04:57.419> lip<00:04:58.500> just

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
okay let's do the same with a lip just

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.570 
okay let's do the same with a lip just
gonna<00:04:59.650> have<00:04:59.770> a<00:04:59.800> listen<00:04:59.979> to<00:05:00.009> the<00:05:00.129> mid<00:05:00.310> actually

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
gonna have a listen to the mid actually

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.279 
gonna have a listen to the mid actually
I<00:05:00.610> might<00:05:00.849> tweak<00:05:01.270> the<00:05:01.770> crossover<00:05:02.770> frequency

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:04.289 
I might tweak the crossover frequency

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:07.830 
I might tweak the crossover frequency
just<00:05:05.289> some<00:05:05.560> get<00:05:05.830> in<00:05:05.949> the<00:05:06.330> mid<00:05:07.330> bits<00:05:07.569> of<00:05:07.690> this

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
just some get in the mid bits of this

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:15.689 
just some get in the mid bits of this
actual<00:05:08.139> drum<00:05:08.379> loop<00:05:08.590> in<00:05:13.590> and<00:05:14.590> I'm<00:05:15.280> really<00:05:15.430> I'm

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:15.699 
actual drum loop in and I'm really I'm

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:17.249 
actual drum loop in and I'm really I'm
gone<00:05:15.940> all<00:05:16.060> the<00:05:16.150> way<00:05:16.180> there<00:05:16.539> so<00:05:16.569> I'm<00:05:16.870> really

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:17.259 
gone all the way there so I'm really

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:19.680 
gone all the way there so I'm really
pulling<00:05:17.469> everything<00:05:17.979> down<00:05:18.159> I<00:05:18.669> go<00:05:19.479> any<00:05:19.629> higher

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
pulling everything down I go any higher

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.080 
pulling everything down I go any higher
I'll<00:05:20.289> completely<00:05:20.740> lose<00:05:20.949> the<00:05:21.099> top<00:05:21.310> end<00:05:21.550> and<00:05:21.969> we

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
I'll completely lose the top end and we

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.730 
I'll completely lose the top end and we
can<00:05:22.210> adjust<00:05:22.300> the<00:05:22.659> attack<00:05:22.990> and<00:05:23.199> release<00:05:23.259> for

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
can adjust the attack and release for

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.180 
can adjust the attack and release for
these<00:05:23.889> as<00:05:24.069> well<00:05:24.219> so<00:05:24.430> I<00:05:24.490> can<00:05:24.669> make<00:05:24.879> it<00:05:25.090> a

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
these as well so I can make it a

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:43.490 
these as well so I can make it a
slightly<00:05:27.190> shorter<00:05:29.159> release<00:05:32.340> sharper<00:05:33.340> attack

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.670 

okay<00:05:44.500> I<00:05:45.690> might<00:05:46.690> compress<00:05:47.020> the<00:05:47.199> bottom<00:05:47.440> end<00:05:47.590> a

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
okay I might compress the bottom end a

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.249 
okay I might compress the bottom end a
little<00:05:47.830> bit<00:05:47.979> as<00:05:48.130> well<00:05:48.419> so<00:05:49.419> just<00:05:49.750> do<00:05:49.870> some<00:05:50.080> now

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:50.259 
little bit as well so just do some now

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:53.240 
little bit as well so just do some now
with<00:05:50.500> compression<00:05:51.069> just<00:05:51.190> on<00:05:51.370> the<00:05:51.460> kick<00:05:51.669> drum

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
with compression just on the kick drum

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:59.279 
with compression just on the kick drum
yeah<00:05:54.250> that's<00:05:54.460> okay<00:05:57.750> and<00:05:58.750> as<00:05:58.900> you're<00:05:59.050> doing

00:05:59.279 --> 00:05:59.289 
yeah that's okay and as you're doing

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:00.360 
yeah that's okay and as you're doing
this<00:05:59.409> it's<00:05:59.680> going<00:05:59.770> to<00:05:59.830> be<00:05:59.919> different<00:06:00.099> for

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
this it's going to be different for

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.339 
this it's going to be different for
every<00:06:00.669> loop<00:06:01.210> you<00:06:01.360> work<00:06:01.539> with<00:06:01.779> and<00:06:01.990> what<00:06:02.289> you

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:02.349 
every loop you work with and what you

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:05.010 
every loop you work with and what you
want<00:06:02.529> to<00:06:02.680> do<00:06:02.800> but<00:06:03.039> just<00:06:03.340> keep<00:06:03.550> a<00:06:03.819> being<00:06:04.690> at<00:06:04.900> the

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020

00:06:06.269 --> 00:06:06.279 
eternia often just check what you're

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:07.740 
eternia often just check what you're
doing<00:06:06.460> is<00:06:06.550> actually<00:06:06.669> making<00:06:06.819> a<00:06:07.180> positive

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
doing is actually making a positive

doing is actually making a positive

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:09.039

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:11.129

that's<00:06:09.969> better<00:06:10.150> already<00:06:10.449> for<00:06:10.629> the<00:06:10.690> X<00:06:10.840> it's<00:06:10.990> got

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:11.139 
that's better already for the X it's got

that's better already for the X it's got
a<00:06:11.169> much<00:06:11.409> tighter<00:06:11.710> sound<00:06:12.039> if<00:06:12.279> you<00:06:12.699> wanted<00:06:13.060> a<00:06:13.150> bit

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330 
a much tighter sound if you wanted a bit

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:14.459 
a much tighter sound if you wanted a bit
more<00:06:13.360> the<00:06:13.539> top<00:06:13.719> end<00:06:13.900> to<00:06:13.960> come<00:06:14.050> out<00:06:14.229> you<00:06:14.319> can

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:14.469 
more the top end to come out you can

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:17.909 
more the top end to come out you can
just<00:06:14.710> you<00:06:15.340> know<00:06:15.449> change<00:06:16.449> the<00:06:16.719> ratio<00:06:16.900> how<00:06:17.650> much

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 
just you know change the ratio how much

downwards<00:06:18.669> expansion<00:06:19.120> you're<00:06:19.270> doing<00:06:22.590> and<00:06:23.590> get

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:23.710 
downwards expansion you're doing and get

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.110 
downwards expansion you're doing and get
it<00:06:23.830> just<00:06:24.009> right<00:06:24.129> to<00:06:24.520> what<00:06:24.669> you<00:06:24.729> think<00:06:24.909> it

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 
it just right to what you think it

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:34.019 
it just right to what you think it
should<00:06:25.300> be<00:06:29.099> okay<00:06:30.099> that's<00:06:30.699> for<00:06:33.000> the<00:06:34.000> other

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:34.029 
should be okay that's for the other

00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:35.550 
should be okay that's for the other
thing<00:06:34.240> I<00:06:34.300> might<00:06:34.419> do<00:06:34.629> is<00:06:34.870> switch<00:06:35.080> it<00:06:35.229> to<00:06:35.259> peak

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:35.560 
thing I might do is switch it to peak

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.070 
thing I might do is switch it to peak
mode<00:06:35.800> rather<00:06:36.639> than<00:06:36.880> RMS<00:06:37.270> peak<00:06:37.509> mode<00:06:37.750> works

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:00.410 
our compressor over here as well I'm not

our compressor over here as well I'm not
really<00:07:00.560> using<00:07:00.770> it<00:07:00.890> a<00:07:00.980> minute<00:07:01.280> um<00:07:01.460> I<00:07:01.790> might

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:02.450 
really using it a minute um I might

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.090 
really using it a minute um I might
sometimes<00:07:02.840> use<00:07:03.080> that<00:07:03.110> on<00:07:03.410> on<00:07:03.680> something<00:07:04.010> like

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:04.100 
sometimes use that on on something like

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.280 
sometimes use that on on something like
this<00:07:04.310> just<00:07:04.700> because<00:07:05.060> even<00:07:05.870> though<00:07:05.960> I'm<00:07:06.020> using

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:06.290 
this just because even though I'm using

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:08.530 
this just because even though I'm using
a<00:07:06.470> technical<00:07:07.370> dynamics<00:07:07.880> processor<00:07:08.360> here

a technical dynamics processor here

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.930 
a technical dynamics processor here
sometimes<00:07:09.530> you<00:07:09.860> can<00:07:10.010> change<00:07:10.280> this<00:07:10.430> so<00:07:10.670> much

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:10.940 
sometimes you can change this so much

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.700 
sometimes you can change this so much
that<00:07:11.000> it<00:07:11.270> can<00:07:11.510> be<00:07:11.660> it<00:07:11.810> just<00:07:12.260> a<00:07:12.350> little<00:07:12.440> bit<00:07:12.560> an

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:12.710 
that it can be it just a little bit an

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.380 
that it can be it just a little bit an
easier<00:07:13.010> fix<00:07:13.220> to<00:07:13.460> just<00:07:13.670> kind<00:07:13.850> of<00:07:13.880> bring<00:07:14.090> it<00:07:14.120> back

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:14.390 
easier fix to just kind of bring it back

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:15.370 
easier fix to just kind of bring it back
a<00:07:14.420> little<00:07:14.540> bit<00:07:14.720> if<00:07:14.840> you've<00:07:14.960> gone<00:07:15.050> a<00:07:15.110> bit<00:07:15.260> too

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:15.380 
a little bit if you've gone a bit too

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.930 
a little bit if you've gone a bit too
far<00:07:15.530> but<00:07:15.920> it's<00:07:16.040> just<00:07:16.190> easier<00:07:16.430> with<00:07:16.580> a<00:07:16.640> single

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:16.940 
far but it's just easier with a single

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.970 
far but it's just easier with a single
Bank<00:07:17.090> compressor<00:07:17.630> so<00:07:18.230> if<00:07:18.320> you<00:07:18.410> do<00:07:18.560> go<00:07:18.770> a<00:07:18.800> bit

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:18.980 
Bank compressor so if you do go a bit

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.410 
Bank compressor so if you do go a bit
too<00:07:19.130> far<00:07:19.400> then<00:07:19.550> you<00:07:19.580> can<00:07:19.790> just<00:07:19.910> turn<00:07:20.120> this<00:07:20.240> on

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:20.420 
too far then you can just turn this on

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.930 
too far then you can just turn this on
and<00:07:20.710> compress<00:07:21.710> your<00:07:21.890> signal<00:07:22.520> a<00:07:22.580> bit<00:07:22.760> if<00:07:22.850> you

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:22.940 
and compress your signal a bit if you

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:26.950 
and compress your signal a bit if you
need<00:07:22.970> to<00:07:25.000> and<00:07:26.000> I<00:07:26.060> think<00:07:26.240> I'm<00:07:26.330> onto<00:07:26.450> this<00:07:26.750> so

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:26.960 
need to and I think I'm onto this so

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.950 
need to and I think I'm onto this so
I'll<00:07:27.230> leave<00:07:27.350> it<00:07:27.500> off<00:07:27.590> for<00:07:27.620> now<00:07:27.850> so<00:07:28.850> yeah<00:07:29.030> that's

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:29.960 
I'll leave it off for now so yeah that's

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:30.910 
I'll leave it off for now so yeah that's
basically<00:07:30.140> what<00:07:30.410> we're<00:07:30.530> doing<00:07:30.560> is<00:07:30.890> just

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:30.920 
basically what we're doing is just

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.610 
basically what we're doing is just
working<00:07:31.640> with<00:07:31.820> the<00:07:31.970> multiband<00:07:32.390> dynamics

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:32.620 
working with the multiband dynamics

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:35.010 
working with the multiband dynamics
downwards<00:07:33.620> expansion<00:07:34.190> and<00:07:34.460> I'm<00:07:34.670> using

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:35.020 
downwards expansion and I'm using

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.020 
downwards expansion and I'm using
downwards<00:07:36.020> compression<00:07:36.650> as<00:07:36.770> well<00:07:36.800> but<00:07:37.790> mainly

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:38.030 
downwards compression as well but mainly

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.390 
downwards compression as well but mainly
just<00:07:38.330> to<00:07:38.510> reduce<00:07:38.660> the<00:07:39.110> the<00:07:39.350> top<00:07:39.890> member<00:07:40.250> to

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:40.400 
just to reduce the the top member to

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.030 
just to reduce the the top member to
still<00:07:40.640> make<00:07:40.820> it<00:07:41.000> sound<00:07:41.210> like<00:07:41.420> a<00:07:42.040> consistent

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:43.040 
still make it sound like a consistent

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.650 
still make it sound like a consistent
beat<00:07:43.340> not<00:07:43.580> that<00:07:43.700> I<00:07:43.730> don't<00:07:44.000> it<00:07:44.210> sound<00:07:44.360> like<00:07:44.480> it's

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:44.660 
beat not that I don't it sound like it's

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.110 
beat not that I don't it sound like it's
been<00:07:44.840> chopped<00:07:45.140> up<00:07:45.380> and<00:07:45.620> gated<00:07:46.370> and<00:07:46.760> it's<00:07:46.940> just

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.120 
been chopped up and gated and it's just

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:54.300 
been chopped up and gated and it's just
gotten<00:07:47.570> much<00:07:47.720> more<00:07:48.100> natural<00:07:49.100> sound<00:07:49.340> to<00:07:49.520> it

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:54.310 

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:57.070 

okay<00:07:55.310> I'll<00:07:55.490> put<00:07:55.700> the<00:07:55.850> projects<00:07:56.420> I'll<00:07:56.870> put<00:07:57.050> a

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:57.080 
okay I'll put the projects I'll put a

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.240 
okay I'll put the projects I'll put a
link<00:07:57.230> to<00:07:57.320> the<00:07:57.500> projects<00:07:57.860> going<00:07:57.890> to<00:07:58.040> download

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:58.250 
link to the projects going to download

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:01.330 
link to the projects going to download
and<00:07:58.520> have<00:07:58.670> a<00:07:58.700> try<00:07:59.620> then<00:08:00.620> you<00:08:00.650> can<00:08:00.980> do<00:08:01.100> that<00:08:01.250> but

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:01.340 
and have a try then you can do that but

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:03.220 
and have a try then you can do that but
it<00:08:01.430> should<00:08:01.640> be<00:08:01.700> straightforward<00:08:01.970> um<00:08:02.480> just

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:03.230 
it should be straightforward um just

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:04.390 
it should be straightforward um just
just<00:08:03.290> you<00:08:03.590> just<00:08:03.770> use<00:08:03.920> the<00:08:04.010> moist<00:08:04.190> plant

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:04.400 
just you just use the moist plant
