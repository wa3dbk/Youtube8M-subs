what's up YouTube my name is Kenneth

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.490 
what's up YouTube my name is Kenneth
today<00:00:03.179> I'm<00:00:03.449> going<00:00:03.600> to<00:00:03.659> show<00:00:03.840> you<00:00:03.870> solve<00:00:04.230> I<00:00:04.350> did

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
today I'm going to show you solve I did

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.099 
today I'm going to show you solve I did
on<00:00:04.680> the<00:00:04.859> master<00:00:05.339> pyramids<00:00:05.759> before<00:00:06.720> I<00:00:06.750> solve

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
on the master pyramids before I solve

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.839 
on the master pyramids before I solve
the<00:00:07.290> puzzle<00:00:07.620> I<00:00:07.710> got<00:00:07.859> to<00:00:07.950> scramble<00:00:08.309> it<00:00:08.340> and<00:00:08.519> I

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
the puzzle I got to scramble it and I

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.930 
the puzzle I got to scramble it and I
think<00:00:09.059> I'll<00:00:09.150> fast<00:00:09.389> forward<00:00:09.480> it<00:00:10.490> the<00:00:11.490> master

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
think I'll fast forward it the master

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.360 
think I'll fast forward it the master
mix<00:00:12.090> is<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.330> pretty<00:00:13.019> fun<00:00:13.230> puzzle<00:00:13.740> to<00:00:13.860> solve<00:00:14.040> I

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
mix is a pretty fun puzzle to solve I

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.369 
mix is a pretty fun puzzle to solve I
was<00:00:14.759> hoping<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.089> practice<00:00:15.540> it<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:15.870> get<00:00:16.230> real

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
was hoping to practice it and get real

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.109 
was hoping to practice it and get real
good<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.770> show<00:00:16.890> you<00:00:16.949> guys<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.160> very<00:00:17.369> fast<00:00:17.760> salt

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
good and show you guys a very fast salt

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.630 
good and show you guys a very fast salt
but<00:00:18.990> I<00:00:19.020> wasn't<00:00:19.320> able<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.560> practice<00:00:19.920> it<00:00:20.039> as<00:00:20.160> much

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
but I wasn't able to practice it as much

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.779 
but I wasn't able to practice it as much
as<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:20.970> would<00:00:21.029> have<00:00:21.300> hoped<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.840> but<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:22.949> did<00:00:23.550> get

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
as I would have hoped to but I did get

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.359 
as I would have hoped to but I did get
okay<00:00:24.300> time<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.689> think<00:00:24.920> the<00:00:25.920> first<00:00:26.130> time<00:00:26.310> I

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
okay time I think the first time I

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.250 
okay time I think the first time I
solved<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:26.820> from<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.330> camera<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.779> got<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:27.960> very

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
solved it from the camera I got a very

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.049 
solved it from the camera I got a very
good<00:00:28.500> fast<00:00:28.859> time<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.490> then<00:00:30.090> of<00:00:30.420> course<00:00:32.059> it

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
good fast time and then of course it

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.229 
good fast time and then of course it
wasn't<00:00:33.329> in<00:00:33.600> frame<00:00:33.899> so<00:00:34.530> I<00:00:34.890> had<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.309> redo<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.120> and

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
wasn't in frame so I had to redo it and

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.209 
wasn't in frame so I had to redo it and
this<00:00:36.450> one's<00:00:36.660> not<00:00:36.840> as<00:00:37.020> fast<00:00:37.230> but<00:00:37.590> at<00:00:37.770> least<00:00:37.950> it's

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
this one's not as fast but at least it's

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.069 
this one's not as fast but at least it's
in<00:00:38.340> frame<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:38.790> guys<00:00:38.910> can<00:00:39.090> see<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.360> so

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
in frame and you guys can see it so

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.369 
in frame and you guys can see it so
anyway<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.460> way<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.579> saw<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.690> use<00:00:43.140> a

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
anyway the way I saw this is I use a

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.260 
anyway the way I saw this is I use a
kind<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.770> reduction<00:00:44.340> method<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.940> what<00:00:45.120> that

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
kind of a reduction method and what that

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.000 
kind of a reduction method and what that
means<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.629> I've<00:00:45.780> reduced<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.469> master

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
means is I've reduced the master

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.760 
means is I've reduced the master
pyraminx<00:00:47.460> which<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.879> four<00:00:48.360> layered<00:00:48.770> puzzle

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
pyraminx which is a four layered puzzle

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.540 
pyraminx which is a four layered puzzle
into<00:00:50.329> Aging's<00:00:51.329> mirroring<00:00:51.899> pyraminx<00:00:52.770> which<00:00:53.370> is

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
into Aging's mirroring pyraminx which is

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.729 
into Aging's mirroring pyraminx which is
a<00:00:53.579> three<00:00:53.879> layer<00:00:54.059> puzzle<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.660> then<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:54.930> solve<00:00:55.559> it

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
a three layer puzzle and then I solve it

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.849 
a three layer puzzle and then I solve it
like<00:00:56.329> Jing's<00:00:57.329> pairings<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.230> right<00:00:58.500> now<00:00:58.620> what

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
like Jing's pairings so right now what

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.700 
like Jing's pairings so right now what
I'm<00:00:58.949> doing<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.309> I'm<00:01:00.289> matching<00:01:01.289> up<00:01:01.440> all<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
I'm doing is I'm matching up all the

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.950 
I'm doing is I'm matching up all the
edge<00:01:01.829> pieces<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.489> make<00:01:02.699> edge<00:01:02.940> trios<00:01:03.660> and

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
edge pieces so I make edge trios and

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.899 
edge pieces so I make edge trios and
right<00:01:04.739> now<00:01:04.890> I<00:01:04.949> believe<00:01:05.100> I'm<00:01:05.519> working<00:01:05.820> on

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
right now I believe I'm working on

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.730 
right now I believe I'm working on
orange<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.630> blueberry<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:08.930> see<00:01:09.930> maybe<00:01:10.170> not<00:01:10.470> I

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
orange and blueberry and see maybe not I

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.580 
orange and blueberry and see maybe not I
don't<00:01:11.100> know<00:01:11.220> what<00:01:11.280> I'm<00:01:11.460> doing<00:01:12.290> it's<00:01:13.290> hard<00:01:13.470> to

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
don't know what I'm doing it's hard to

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.160 
don't know what I'm doing it's hard to
see<00:01:13.770> let's<00:01:14.010> see<00:01:14.270> yeah<00:01:15.360> orange<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.720> blue<00:01:15.810> so

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
see let's see yeah orange and blue so

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.200 
see let's see yeah orange and blue so
you<00:01:16.259> told<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.619> orange<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.070> blue<00:01:17.100> trio<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.909> done

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
you told you orange a blue trio is done

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.999 
you told you orange a blue trio is done
now<00:01:18.780> I'm<00:01:18.930> probably<00:01:19.110> working<00:01:19.380> on<00:01:19.560> yellow<00:01:19.890> and

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
now I'm probably working on yellow and

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.999 
now I'm probably working on yellow and
blue<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.630> gonna<00:01:21.630> make<00:01:21.840> another<00:01:22.259> yellow<00:01:22.619> blue

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
blue and gonna make another yellow blue

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.130 
blue and gonna make another yellow blue
tree<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.250> think<00:01:23.340> that's<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.790> last<00:01:24.119> one<00:01:24.659> that

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
tree I think that's the last one that

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.520 
tree I think that's the last one that
needs<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.530> be<00:01:25.619> done<00:01:25.979> like<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:28.049> now<00:01:28.200> all

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
needs to be done like that and now all

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.340 
needs to be done like that and now all
of<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.979> edges<00:01:29.460> are<00:01:29.700> done<00:01:30.030> then<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:31.049> have<00:01:31.170> to

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
of the edges are done then you have to

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.679 
of the edges are done then you have to
spin<00:01:31.860> all<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.369> corner<00:01:32.850> caps<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.540> there's

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
spin all the corner caps and there's

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.240 
spin all the corner caps and there's
only<00:01:33.810> three<00:01:33.930> positions<00:01:34.590> are<00:01:34.710> pretty<00:01:34.890> obvious

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
only three positions are pretty obvious

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.940 
only three positions are pretty obvious
so<00:01:35.280> there's<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.700> last<00:01:35.880> one<00:01:36.030> now<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.259> looks

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
so there's the last one now it looks

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.830 
so there's the last one now it looks
like<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.250> jeans<00:01:38.610> pair<00:01:38.850> makes<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.299> acts<00:01:39.509> like<00:01:39.720> a

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
like a jeans pair makes and acts like a

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.149 
like a jeans pair makes and acts like a
Jing's<00:01:40.140> Pirie<00:01:40.409> pyraminx

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
Jing's Pirie pyraminx

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.130 
Jing's Pirie pyraminx
so<00:01:41.340> I'm<00:01:41.520> solving<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.150> like<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.360> jeans<00:01:42.720> Burmese

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
so I'm solving it like a jeans Burmese

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.719 
so I'm solving it like a jeans Burmese
which<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.250> pretty<00:01:44.490> easy<00:01:44.729> right<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:45.829> yeah<00:01:46.829> I'd

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
which is pretty easy right so yeah I'd

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.819 
which is pretty easy right so yeah I'd
like<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.210> do<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.509> orange<00:01:48.840> side<00:01:49.140> first<00:01:49.590> because

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
like to do the orange side first because

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.719 
like to do the orange side first because
it's<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.460> closest<00:01:50.880> color<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.420> red<00:01:51.860> and<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:53.460> do

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
it's the closest color to red and I do

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.940 
it's the closest color to red and I do
like<00:01:54.060> solving<00:01:54.329> puzzles<00:01:54.600> red<00:01:55.049> first<00:01:55.409> but<00:01:55.710> I

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
like solving puzzles red first but I

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.200 
like solving puzzles red first but I
guess<00:01:56.280> actually<00:01:56.520> orange<00:01:57.030> first<00:01:57.270> here

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.970 

now<00:02:01.210> what<00:02:01.420> happens<00:02:01.750> is<00:02:01.990> I<00:02:02.230> get<00:02:02.290> this<00:02:02.650> weird

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:02.980 
now what happens is I get this weird

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.840 
now what happens is I get this weird
case<00:02:03.370> where<00:02:04.260> it<00:02:05.260> looks<00:02:05.740> like<00:02:06.520> there's

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
case where it looks like there's

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:07.650 
case where it looks like there's
something<00:02:07.030> wrong<00:02:07.300> here

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
something wrong here

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.660 
something wrong here
Jynx<00:02:08.229> pyraminx<00:02:08.619> would<00:02:08.800> never<00:02:09.009> look<00:02:09.250> like<00:02:09.280> this

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
Jynx pyraminx would never look like this

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:10.950 
Jynx pyraminx would never look like this
and<00:02:09.850> that's<00:02:09.970> because<00:02:10.360> there's<00:02:10.570> kind<00:02:10.720> of<00:02:10.840> like

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
and that's because there's kind of like

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.710 
and that's because there's kind of like
a<00:02:11.260> parity<00:02:11.770> and<00:02:11.920> so<00:02:12.880> that's<00:02:13.060> throwing<00:02:13.360> me<00:02:13.480> off

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
a parity and so that's throwing me off

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.690 
a parity and so that's throwing me off
here<00:02:13.960> because<00:02:14.080> I'm<00:02:14.350> trying<00:02:14.530> to<00:02:14.680> visualize<00:02:15.640> how

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
here because I'm trying to visualize how

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.720 
here because I'm trying to visualize how
to<00:02:15.970> solve<00:02:16.360> it<00:02:16.480> like<00:02:16.570> a<00:02:16.630> jeans<00:02:16.900> pair<00:02:17.140> means

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
to solve it like a jeans pair means

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.600 
to solve it like a jeans pair means
anyway<00:02:18.900> so<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:20.260> jeans<00:02:20.470> pair<00:02:20.740> makes<00:02:20.950> is<00:02:21.100> that's

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
anyway so the jeans pair makes is that's

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.520 
anyway so the jeans pair makes is that's
why<00:02:21.790> I'm<00:02:21.880> pausing<00:02:22.600> their<00:02:22.750> jeans<00:02:23.110> pair<00:02:23.350> makes

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
why I'm pausing their jeans pair makes

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.090 
why I'm pausing their jeans pair makes
now<00:02:23.710> is<00:02:25.110> solved<00:02:26.110> but<00:02:26.500> you<00:02:26.590> can<00:02:26.710> see<00:02:26.920> there's

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
now is solved but you can see there's

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.950 
now is solved but you can see there's
that<00:02:27.250> little<00:02:27.430> top<00:02:27.820> corner<00:02:28.210> that<00:02:28.450> looks<00:02:28.510> wrong

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
that little top corner that looks wrong

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.840 
that little top corner that looks wrong
so<00:02:29.290> it's<00:02:29.710> kind<00:02:29.890> of<00:02:29.920> like<00:02:30.070> a<00:02:30.100> parody<00:02:30.580> I<00:02:30.610> don't

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
so it's kind of like a parody I don't

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.060 
so it's kind of like a parody I don't
know<00:02:30.940> if<00:02:31.030> it's<00:02:31.150> it's<00:02:31.480> an<00:02:31.690> actual<00:02:32.110> parody<00:02:32.920> by

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
know if it's it's an actual parody by

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.699 
know if it's it's an actual parody by
definition<00:02:33.400> but<00:02:33.820> anyway<00:02:34.230> so<00:02:35.230> that's<00:02:35.470> how<00:02:35.680> I

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
definition but anyway so that's how I

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.130 
definition but anyway so that's how I
solve<00:02:36.250> a<00:02:36.520> master<00:02:36.970> pyraminx<00:02:37.300> I<00:02:37.600> hope<00:02:38.020> you

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
solve a master pyraminx I hope you

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.680 
solve a master pyraminx I hope you
