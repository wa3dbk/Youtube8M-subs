00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello today start a long time ago 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.700
 promised exercises for girls when 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.470
 I immediately want to apologize to you that 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.330
 we took so long we thought over 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.070
 concept finally this concept 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.969
 formed and will it look 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.710
 as follows 2 3 minute videos 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.539
 weekly I hope in each of 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.699
 which any one will understand 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.369
 fundamental fitness exercise 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.529
 so we will form the base those of 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.150
 who knows you this base for saying that 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.320
 even it will be useful for you to see and 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.970
 maybe catch some technical 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.340
 moments because we will 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.829
 focus on all the details 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.790
 this or that exercise will start now 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.640
 we will analyze the execution technique 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.129
 Squatting will help us to be beautiful 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.870
 victoria looking at her movement we can 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.890
 discuss the main technical points 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.180
 squats are firstly one of the most 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.039
 basic exercises for development 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.920
 human body first 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.250
 aimed at the lower body ie 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.440
 Naturally the muscles of the legs and buttocks lower back 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.090
 I think that the other muscles that holds 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.770
 position 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.799
 main technical issues and the most important 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.170
 technical moments first 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:09.270
 always make sure that your body weight 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.950
 located on the heels and then 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.720
 the following body weight occurs 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.280
 as much as possible you back 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.500
 imagine what you sit on 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.540
 imaginary 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.880
 how about a bench here ? 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.580
 you just sit down on top 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.260
 part of the body is exactly the location of body weight 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.300
 on heels makes you hold 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.979
 as vertical as possible so upper 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.800
 part of the body does not lean forward 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.510
 held as vertically as possible and this is 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.650
 turn is achieved due to the fact 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.560
 to look 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.450
 direct either upwards or upwards easier 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.460
 look a little upwards that is 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.100
 throws his head back upper body 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.060
 hold as vertically as possible 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.090
 imagine that we sit down on 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.850
 imaginary bench and thereby 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.190
 we place 200 la on the heels further like 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.320
 you can check yourself ask 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.990
 to see someone on the side of how 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.500
 you do squats and track to 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.320
 line more precisely the plane that reach 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.539
 knees did not go beyond the line of toes then 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.660
 have you spend an imaginary plane 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:10.880
 10 and you can touch as much as possible 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:13.370
 to this plane but not bring your knees 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.350
 forward if the knees come forward means 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.510
 eye body too far forward 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.480
 should be moved back further 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.930
 breath exhale is done on the rise is 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.600
 crucial moment watch this breath on 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.670
 launch Anya and Buda to lift if the weight 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.560
 heavy would get along save save 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.019
 reduce it to a minimum try 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.930
 breathe all the same free the number of times 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.819
 who need to do squats 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.590
 effective number of times starts with 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.480
 12 15 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.609
 I would advise you to always 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.829
 aim more times 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:49.159
 that is, if we train the top 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:51.560
 spacing 6 8 10 then lower body 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:52.099
 will always train a gap of 12 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.780
 and higher 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.310
 muscles which we hope in this 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.659
 exercise friends now let's go 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.730
 on them quadriceps 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:01.459
 natural back of the thigh 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.010
 especially the outer point of the amplitude of the buttocks 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.560
 Of course, then for what beautiful 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.169
 girls doing this exercise lower back 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.030
 i.e. long back muscles tense up 

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:12.859
 since they hold the position of the top 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.579
 body parts speakers are not very many 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:16.159
 lower back 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:18.079
 but it works quite well so 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:19.900
 core muscles once again quadriceps and 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.120
 back of the thigh and buttocks 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.459
 long back muscles hold position 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.090
 calf muscles hold position 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.090
 such a squat technique 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.599
 soups
