well today we're going to do a

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.099 
well today we're going to do a
comparison<00:00:02.700> of<00:00:03.319> new<00:00:04.319> technology<00:00:04.980> that<00:00:05.009> is

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:06.109 
comparison of new technology that is

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
and this is the recessed mountain out of

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.080 
and this is the recessed mountain out of
one<00:01:30.720> so<00:01:31.590> they<00:01:31.710> do<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.890> like-for-like<00:01:32.220> with<00:01:32.970> the

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
one so they do a like-for-like with the

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.810 
one so they do a like-for-like with the
elune<00:01:33.360> with<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.049> recessed<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:35.520> now<00:01:35.670> we're

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
elune with the recessed so now we're

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.800 
elune with the recessed so now we're
gonna<00:01:36.180> have<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.360> look<00:01:36.420> at<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.630> light

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
gonna have a look at the light

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.210 
gonna have a look at the light
comparison<00:01:37.470> because<00:01:37.619> this<00:01:37.740> is<00:01:37.860> what<00:01:37.979> it's<00:01:38.100> all

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
comparison because this is what it's all

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.539 
comparison because this is what it's all
about

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
about

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.319 
about
how<00:01:38.939> good<00:01:39.210> are<00:01:39.509> these<00:01:40.790> producing<00:01:41.790> light<00:01:42.000> from

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
how good are these producing light from

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.190 
how good are these producing light from
a<00:01:42.600> solar<00:01:42.840> panel<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.939> is<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.060> Illume<00:01:45.329> the

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
a solar panel that is the Illume the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.639 
a solar panel that is the Illume the
thousand<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.950> fifty<00:01:47.820> lumen<00:01:48.409> alone

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
thousand and fifty lumen alone

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.510 
thousand and fifty lumen alone
and<00:01:50.159> this<00:01:50.430> is<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.909> Salar<00:01:51.270> O'Day<00:01:51.710> okay<00:01:52.710> so<00:01:52.770> what

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
and this is the Salar O'Day okay so what

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.929 
and this is the Salar O'Day okay so what
we<00:01:53.640> might<00:01:53.790> do<00:01:54.060> is<00:01:54.710> just<00:01:55.710> turn<00:01:56.310> off<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.579> Salar<00:01:56.880> a

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
we might do is just turn off the Salar a

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.350 
we might do is just turn off the Salar a
day<00:01:57.590> and<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.710> switched<00:01:59.009> off<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.759> we<00:02:00.060> can<00:02:00.240> do

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
day and I switched off and we can do

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.149 
day and I switched off and we can do
this<00:02:00.509> by<00:02:00.750> breaking<00:02:01.049> into<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.500> line<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:02.040> have

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
this by breaking into the line and have

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.620 
this by breaking into the line and have
a<00:02:02.189> switch<00:02:02.430> on<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.670> wall<00:02:02.850> which<00:02:03.030> is<00:02:03.060> relatively

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
a switch on the wall which is relatively

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.969 
a switch on the wall which is relatively
easy<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.820> the<00:02:05.820> elune<00:02:06.149> there<00:02:06.780> is<00:02:07.049> is<00:02:07.380> shining

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
easy and the elune there is is shining

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.800 
easy and the elune there is is shining
away<00:02:08.220> there<00:02:08.520> now<00:02:09.209> we<00:02:09.360> just<00:02:09.479> have<00:02:09.629> a<00:02:09.660> quick

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
away there now we just have a quick

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.880 
away there now we just have a quick
glance

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
glance

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.510 
glance
in<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.190> room<00:02:12.080> for<00:02:13.080> light<00:02:13.319> it<00:02:14.040> is<00:02:14.160> a<00:02:14.190> three

grabbed<00:02:18.780> Lux<00:02:19.440> meter

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
grabbed Lux meter

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.760 
grabbed Lux meter
I'll<00:02:20.250> get<00:02:20.400> my<00:02:21.350> assistant<00:02:22.350> Mario<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.780> do<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:24.810> bit

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
I'll get my assistant Mario to do a bit

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.350 
I'll get my assistant Mario to do a bit
of<00:02:25.860> a<00:02:25.920> test<00:02:26.160> theater<00:02:26.550> to<00:02:26.700> give<00:02:26.850> us<00:02:26.940> actual

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
of a test theater to give us actual

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.060 
of a test theater to give us actual
real-life

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
real-life

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.850 
real-life
data<00:02:29.300> now<00:02:30.300> we'll<00:02:31.140> hold<00:02:31.320> it<00:02:31.440> at<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.560> same<00:02:31.800> level

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
data now we'll hold it at the same level

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.880 
data now we'll hold it at the same level
for<00:02:32.310> both<00:02:32.490> sides<00:02:32.820> so<00:02:33.180> that<00:02:33.770> is<00:02:34.940> roughly<00:02:36.050> 70<00:02:37.050> 71

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
for both sides so that is roughly 70 71

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.199 
for both sides so that is roughly 70 71
72<00:02:38.180> lumens<00:02:39.950> okay<00:02:40.980> so<00:02:41.340> that's<00:02:41.520> coming<00:02:41.790> off<00:02:41.940> the

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
72 lumens okay so that's coming off the

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.110 
72 lumens okay so that's coming off the
Illume<00:02:42.540> which<00:02:43.260> is<00:02:43.470> that<00:02:43.650> one<00:02:43.830> there<00:02:43.860> okay

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
Illume which is that one there okay

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.650 
Illume which is that one there okay
so<00:02:45.930> Mike<00:02:46.140> escape<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.650> Mario<00:02:47.610> to<00:02:47.730> switch<00:02:48.450> that

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
so Mike escape to Mario to switch that

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.009 
so Mike escape to Mario to switch that
off

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
off

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.229 
off
Illume<00:02:49.410> will<00:02:50.340> be<00:02:50.430> cast<00:02:50.640> switch<00:02:50.880> it<00:02:51.000> off<00:02:51.090> we

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
Illume will be cast switch it off we

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:57.650 
Illume will be cast switch it off we
have<00:02:51.269> you<00:02:51.510> actually<00:02:51.870> unplug<00:02:52.170> it

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.650 

now<00:02:58.590> moving<00:02:59.580> darkness<00:03:00.030> now<00:03:00.239> and<00:03:00.420> I'll<00:03:00.510> just

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
now moving darkness now and I'll just

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.160 
now moving darkness now and I'll just
switch<00:03:00.930> on<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.700> Salar<00:03:02.700> a<00:03:02.730> day<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:03.870> we<00:03:03.989> might

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
switch on the Salar a day and we might

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.000 
switch on the Salar a day and we might
do<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.580> lumen<00:03:05.580> test<00:03:05.820> again<00:03:06.120> just<00:03:06.570> to<00:03:06.720> get<00:03:06.930> a

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
do the lumen test again just to get a

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:13.220 
do the lumen test again just to get a
real-life<00:03:08.750> actual<00:03:10.160> lumens<00:03:11.330> comparison<00:03:12.330> and

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
real-life actual lumens comparison and

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.870 
real-life actual lumens comparison and
it<00:03:13.410> is<00:03:14.239> 275<00:03:16.070> lumens<00:03:17.070> so<00:03:17.130> you<00:03:17.280> can<00:03:17.489> see<00:03:17.700> a

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
it is 275 lumens so you can see a

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.680 
it is 275 lumens so you can see a
massive<00:03:18.540> difference<00:03:18.930> in<00:03:19.260> light<00:03:19.739> comparison

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
massive difference in light comparison

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.650 
massive difference in light comparison
to<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:22.070> to<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.190> Illume<00:03:23.489> and<00:03:23.519> that<00:03:24.299> this<00:03:24.510> is

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
to the to the Illume and that this is

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.240 
to the to the Illume and that this is
the<00:03:24.780> surface<00:03:25.110> mount<00:03:25.350> of<00:03:25.500> fitting<00:03:25.769> to<00:03:25.980> by<00:03:26.190> the

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
the surface mount of fitting to by the

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.710 
the surface mount of fitting to by the
way<00:03:27.019> now<00:03:28.280> like<00:03:29.280> for<00:03:29.519> light<00:03:29.700> conditions<00:03:30.299> I'll

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
way now like for light conditions I'll

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.640 
way now like for light conditions I'll
quickly<00:03:31.170> help<00:03:31.590> shoot<00:03:32.489> outside<00:03:33.170> and<00:03:34.170> you<00:03:34.500> will

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
quickly help shoot outside and you will

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:41.870 
quickly help shoot outside and you will
see<00:03:39.560> it<00:03:40.560> is<00:03:40.709> a<00:03:40.739> cloudy<00:03:41.100> and<00:03:41.430> it's<00:03:41.579> actually

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
see it is a cloudy and it's actually

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.740 
see it is a cloudy and it's actually
raining<00:03:42.200> it<00:03:43.200> is<00:03:43.320> raining<00:03:44.209> to<00:03:45.209> cloudy<00:03:45.450> day<00:03:45.690> so

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
raining it is raining to cloudy day so

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.960 
raining it is raining to cloudy day so
it<00:03:46.079> is<00:03:46.200> like<00:03:46.410> for<00:03:46.650> like<00:03:46.739> who<00:03:47.040> solar<00:03:47.340> panels<00:03:47.760> but

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
it is like for like who solar panels but

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.930 
it is like for like who solar panels but
this<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:49.140> Loom<00:03:49.500> has<00:03:49.739> its<00:03:50.100> own<00:03:50.250> solar<00:03:50.549> panel

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
this the Loom has its own solar panel

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.680 
this the Loom has its own solar panel
and<00:03:51.060> the<00:03:52.579> Salar<00:03:53.579> day<00:03:53.850> has<00:03:54.030> its<00:03:54.209> own<00:03:54.360> solar

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
and the Salar day has its own solar

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.270 
and the Salar day has its own solar
panel<00:03:55.610> okay<00:03:56.610> so<00:03:57.030> we<00:03:57.209> will<00:03:57.799> just<00:03:58.799> shoot<00:03:59.040> back

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
panel okay so we will just shoot back

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:07.699 
panel okay so we will just shoot back
inside<00:04:04.190> okay<00:04:05.660> so<00:04:06.660> there<00:04:07.019> you<00:04:07.049> have<00:04:07.380> it<00:04:07.500> there's

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
inside okay so there you have it there's

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.550 
inside okay so there you have it there's
a<00:04:07.799> comparison<00:04:08.489> of<00:04:09.030> of<00:04:09.540> light<00:04:10.049> might<00:04:10.290> just<00:04:10.470> get

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
a comparison of of light might just get

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:18.780 
a comparison of of light might just get
you<00:04:10.680> to<00:04:10.769> plug<00:04:10.950> that<00:04:11.130> alone<00:04:11.519> back<00:04:11.760> in<00:04:11.970> for<00:04:12.209> me

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.670 

okay

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
okay

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.350 
okay
so<00:04:21.850> again<00:04:22.850> like<00:04:23.840> for<00:04:24.139> like<00:04:25.120> comparative<00:04:26.120> might

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
so again like for like comparative might

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.680 
so again like for like comparative might
that<00:04:26.690> salar<00:04:27.440> eight-day<00:04:27.800> is<00:04:28.130> clearly<00:04:28.690> pumping

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
that salar eight-day is clearly pumping

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.930 
that salar eight-day is clearly pumping
out<00:04:29.840> more<00:04:30.020> lumens<00:04:30.500> at<00:04:31.010> any<00:04:31.160> given<00:04:31.370> time<00:04:31.580> of<00:04:31.790> day

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
out more lumens at any given time of day

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.920 
out more lumens at any given time of day
because<00:04:32.720> it's<00:04:33.169> a<00:04:33.290> both<00:04:34.070> relative<00:04:34.630> to<00:04:35.630> the<00:04:35.720> time

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
because it's a both relative to the time

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.070 
because it's a both relative to the time
of<00:04:35.960> day<00:04:36.229> in<00:04:36.500> the<00:04:36.620> same<00:04:36.800> conditions<00:04:37.630> so<00:04:38.630> for<00:04:38.990> my

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
of day in the same conditions so for my

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.070 
of day in the same conditions so for my
money<00:04:39.580> the<00:04:40.580> Solara<00:04:40.940> day<00:04:41.210> is<00:04:41.270> by<00:04:41.510> far<00:04:41.780> a<00:04:41.810> better

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
money the Solara day is by far a better

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.290 
money the Solara day is by far a better
product<00:04:42.770> they're<00:04:43.460> producing<00:04:43.880> the<00:04:43.970> light<00:04:44.090> from

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
product they're producing the light from

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.930 
product they're producing the light from
a<00:04:44.449> solar<00:04:44.660> panel<00:04:44.930> so<00:04:45.919> that<00:04:46.130> concludes<00:04:46.340> today

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
a solar panel so that concludes today

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.770 
a solar panel so that concludes today
I'll<00:04:47.120> just<00:04:47.150> give<00:04:47.960> it<00:04:47.990> an<00:04:48.260> honest<00:04:48.530> opinion<00:04:48.770> and

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
I'll just give it an honest opinion and

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.280 
I'll just give it an honest opinion and
