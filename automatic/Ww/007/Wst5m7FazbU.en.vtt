weird<00:01:23.759> noise<00:01:24.090> when<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.600> when<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.170> sew<00:01:26.090> and<00:01:27.090> that's

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
weird noise when I when I sew and that's

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.330 
weird noise when I when I sew and that's
why<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.570> started<00:01:28.079> reading<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.770> see<00:01:28.950> what<00:01:29.189> was

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
why I started reading it to see what was

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.749 
why I started reading it to see what was
going<00:01:29.640> on<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.680> sure<00:01:31.680> enough<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:32.189> said<00:01:32.640> it

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
going on and sure enough that said it

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.560 
going on and sure enough that said it
should<00:01:32.939> be<00:01:32.970> oiled<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:34.520> there<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.610> go<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.149> I

think that I could actually remove the

stuck<00:02:22.790> down<00:02:23.000> there<00:02:24.940> what<00:02:25.940> quite<00:02:26.209> sure<00:02:26.450> how<00:02:26.599> you

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630

down<00:02:29.330> there<00:02:29.599> I<00:02:29.780> don't<00:02:29.959> see<00:02:30.200> anything<00:02:30.470> stuck

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.699 
down there I don't see anything stuck
down<00:02:31.190> there<00:02:31.220> so<00:02:32.019> I'm<00:02:33.019> just<00:02:33.260> going<00:02:33.380> to<00:02:33.470> type<00:02:33.680> my

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
down there so I'm just going to type my

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:40.710 
down there so I'm just going to type my
little<00:02:34.040> brush<00:02:35.950> and<00:02:37.360> kind<00:02:38.360> of<00:02:38.480> lift<00:02:38.660> this<00:02:38.840> up

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
just going to put that on here I have

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.150 
just going to put that on here I have
two<00:05:41.250> little<00:05:41.490> really<00:05:42.270> areas<00:05:42.840> and<00:05:43.140> I'm<00:05:43.710> hoping

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 
two little really areas and I'm hoping

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.710 
two little really areas and I'm hoping
that<00:05:44.220> this<00:05:44.460> is<00:05:44.490> going<00:05:44.760> to<00:05:44.820> prevent<00:05:45.180> my<00:05:45.360> machine

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 
that this is going to prevent my machine

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.450 
that this is going to prevent my machine
for<00:05:45.900> making<00:05:46.020> that<00:05:46.290> god-awful<00:05:46.590> noise<00:05:47.100> it<00:05:47.370> was

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
for making that god-awful noise it was

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.790 
for making that god-awful noise it was
making<00:05:47.850> I<00:05:48.290> guess<00:05:49.290> I<00:05:49.440> should<00:05:49.590> have<00:05:49.680> probably

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
making I guess I should have probably

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.370 
making I guess I should have probably
read<00:05:50.010> about<00:05:50.070> it<00:05:50.370> earlier<00:05:50.729> okay<00:05:51.510> so<00:05:52.200> I<00:05:52.260> think

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
read about it earlier okay so I think

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.800 
read about it earlier okay so I think
that's<00:05:52.770> it<00:05:53.190> so<00:05:54.260> what<00:05:55.260> I'm<00:05:55.350> going<00:05:55.470> to<00:05:55.500> do<00:05:56.450> now<00:05:57.450> is

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
that's it so what I'm going to do now is

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.720 
that's it so what I'm going to do now is
I'm<00:05:57.960> going<00:05:58.080> to<00:05:58.169> close<00:05:58.680> this<00:05:58.979> oil<00:05:59.550> back<00:05:59.820> up
