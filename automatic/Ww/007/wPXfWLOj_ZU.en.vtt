head<00:00:21.830> of<00:00:21.949> the<00:00:22.009> molecular<00:00:22.400> boundaries<00:00:28.720> what<00:00:29.720> is

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:29.839 
head of the molecular boundaries what is

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:31.779 
head of the molecular boundaries what is
it<00:00:29.960> about<00:00:30.079> chemistry<00:00:30.949> that<00:00:31.189> I<00:00:31.249> need<00:00:31.519> to<00:00:31.640> know

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:31.789 
it about chemistry that I need to know

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:33.520 
it about chemistry that I need to know
that's<00:00:31.999> gonna<00:00:32.119> make<00:00:32.390> me<00:00:32.570> realize<00:00:33.079> it<00:00:33.290> it<00:00:33.380> has

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
that's gonna make me realize it it has

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.870 
that's gonna make me realize it it has
right<00:00:34.030> chemistry<00:00:35.030> is<00:00:35.300> really<00:00:35.720> about<00:00:36.880> atoms

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:37.880 
right chemistry is really about atoms

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.820 
right chemistry is really about atoms
and<00:00:38.150> how<00:00:38.180> atoms<00:00:38.960> are<00:00:39.140> connected<00:00:39.620> in<00:00:39.940> space<00:00:40.940> and

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:41.830 
and how atoms are connected in space and

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.300 
and how atoms are connected in space and
of<00:00:42.830> course<00:00:43.190> a<00:00:43.730> lot<00:00:44.210> of<00:00:44.330> things<00:00:44.570> that<00:00:44.720> we<00:00:44.870> see

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:45.310 
of course a lot of things that we see

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.750 
of course a lot of things that we see
around<00:00:46.310> us<00:00:46.550> are<00:00:46.760> made<00:00:46.970> of<00:00:47.740> molecules<00:00:48.760> atoms

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
around us are made of molecules atoms

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.740 
around us are made of molecules atoms
that<00:00:50.480> make<00:00:50.720> molecules<00:00:51.110> and<00:00:51.710> molecules<00:00:51.890> that

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
that make molecules and molecules that

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.690 
that make molecules and molecules that
assemble<00:00:53.750> to<00:00:54.140> make<00:00:54.290> larger<00:00:54.710> objects<00:00:55.220> so<00:00:55.430> I

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:55.700 
assemble to make larger objects so I

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.380 
assemble to make larger objects so I
think<00:00:56.330> chemists<00:00:57.110> in<00:00:57.350> general<00:00:58.000> like<00:00:59.000> to<00:00:59.210> dig

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
think chemists in general like to dig

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.670 
think chemists in general like to dig
deeper<00:00:59.870> beneath<00:01:00.230> the<00:01:01.390> the<00:01:02.390> the<00:01:02.660> the<00:01:03.080> the<00:01:03.440> world

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
deeper beneath the the the the the world

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.760 
deeper beneath the the the the the world
that<00:01:03.890> we<00:01:04.040> see<00:01:04.070> I<00:01:04.580> think<00:01:05.180> they<00:01:05.509> are<00:01:05.770> really

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
that we see I think they are really

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.649 
that we see I think they are really
enamored<00:01:07.070> by<00:01:07.280> the<00:01:07.460> hidden<00:01:08.000> what<00:01:08.210> I<00:01:08.240> call<00:01:08.509> the

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
enamored by the hidden what I call the

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.520 
enamored by the hidden what I call the
hidden<00:01:08.840> world<00:01:09.219> what<00:01:10.219> is<00:01:10.340> behind<00:01:10.549> a<00:01:11.530> phenomena

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
hidden world what is behind a phenomena

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.620 
hidden world what is behind a phenomena
what<00:01:12.770> is<00:01:12.920> you<00:01:13.189> know<00:01:13.310> why<00:01:13.520> does<00:01:14.060> a<00:01:14.090> material

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
what is you know why does a material

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.260 
what is you know why does a material
behave<00:01:15.020> in<00:01:15.259> the<00:01:15.350> way<00:01:15.469> it<00:01:15.619> does<00:01:15.859> and<00:01:16.159> not<00:01:16.999> just

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
behave in the way it does and not just

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.080 
behave in the way it does and not just
why<00:01:17.570> but<00:01:18.530> also<00:01:18.799> how<00:01:19.429> do<00:01:19.490> we<00:01:19.729> make<00:01:19.909> it<00:01:19.939> better

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
why but also how do we make it better

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.160 
why but also how do we make it better
how<00:01:20.630> do<00:01:20.689> we<00:01:21.909> how<00:01:22.909> do<00:01:22.969> we<00:01:23.090> change<00:01:23.329> it<00:01:23.600> so<00:01:23.869> so

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
how do we how do we change it so so

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.289 
how do we how do we change it so so
chemistry<00:01:24.679> is<00:01:24.740> not<00:01:24.950> just<00:01:25.249> about<00:01:25.460> what<00:01:25.969> I<00:01:25.999> said

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
chemistry is not just about what I said

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.330 
chemistry is not just about what I said
is<00:01:26.450> not<00:01:26.479> just<00:01:26.630> about<00:01:26.990> the<00:01:27.740> atoms<00:01:28.130> and<00:01:28.280> how

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
is not just about the atoms and how

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.219 
is not just about the atoms and how
they're<00:01:28.640> connected<00:01:28.999> but<00:01:29.149> also<00:01:29.299> how<00:01:30.079> they

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
they're connected but also how they

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.590 
they're connected but also how they
transform<00:01:30.829> into<00:01:30.920> other<00:01:31.130> things<00:01:31.569> for<00:01:32.569> example

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
transform into other things for example

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.649 
transform into other things for example
a<00:01:32.990> chemist<00:01:33.380> could<00:01:33.590> wist<00:01:33.920> around<00:01:34.280> an<00:01:34.670> atom<00:01:35.299> in<00:01:35.600> a

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
a chemist could wist around an atom in a

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.569 
a chemist could wist around an atom in a
molecule<00:01:35.810> and<00:01:36.380> channel<00:01:36.679> molecule<00:01:37.069> from<00:01:37.249> being

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
molecule and channel molecule from being

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:41.109 
molecule and channel molecule from being
a<00:01:37.670> poison<00:01:38.090> into<00:01:38.240> medicine<00:01:38.560> so<00:01:39.560> it's<00:01:40.369> that<00:01:40.729> type

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
a poison into medicine so it's that type

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.319 
a poison into medicine so it's that type
of<00:01:41.149> control<00:01:41.659> that<00:01:42.079> you<00:01:42.139> want<00:01:42.439> to<00:01:42.530> have<00:01:42.770> on<00:01:43.369> the

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
of control that you want to have on the

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:48.279 
of control that you want to have on the
on<00:01:44.569> this<00:01:44.929> hidden<00:01:45.319> world<00:01:45.759> to<00:01:46.759> allow<00:01:47.240> you<00:01:47.299> to<00:01:47.810> to

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
on this hidden world to allow you to to

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:51.910 
on this hidden world to allow you to to
do<00:01:48.469> beneficial<00:01:49.069> things<00:01:50.619> and<00:01:51.619> we're<00:01:51.799> all

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
do beneficial things and we're all

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.069 
do beneficial things and we're all
chemists<00:01:52.399> equally<00:01:52.729> curious<00:01:53.179> about<00:01:53.509> this<00:01:53.899> in

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
chemists equally curious about this in

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.709 
chemists equally curious about this in
organic<00:01:54.560> organic<00:01:55.060> fusion<00:01:56.060> if<00:01:56.179> I<00:01:56.270> may<00:01:56.420> call<00:01:56.569> it

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 
organic organic fusion if I may call it

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:02.080 
organic organic fusion if I may call it
that<00:01:56.869> I<00:01:57.609> think<00:01:58.609> most<00:01:58.929> most<00:01:59.929> chemists<00:02:00.469> are<00:02:01.090> yeah

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
that I think most most chemists are yeah

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.660 
that I think most most chemists are yeah
I<00:02:02.119> mean<00:02:02.299> maybe<00:02:02.600> the<00:02:02.929> feelings<00:02:03.259> I<00:02:03.380> am<00:02:03.619> I've<00:02:04.130> just

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
I mean maybe the feelings I am I've just

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.029 
I mean maybe the feelings I am I've just
expressed<00:02:05.029> may<00:02:05.929> be<00:02:05.990> not<00:02:06.259> uncommon<00:02:06.649> among

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
expressed may be not uncommon among

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.760 
expressed may be not uncommon among
chemists<00:02:07.459> I<00:02:07.520> think<00:02:07.729> we're<00:02:07.909> all<00:02:08.709> excited<00:02:09.709> about

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
chemists I think we're all excited about

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.760 
chemists I think we're all excited about
this<00:02:10.130> exploration<00:02:10.610> and<00:02:11.060> discovery<00:02:11.620> trying<00:02:12.620> to

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
this exploration and discovery trying to

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.670 
this exploration and discovery trying to
find<00:02:13.040> out<00:02:13.280> how<00:02:14.239> we<00:02:14.299> can<00:02:14.599> make<00:02:14.780> new<00:02:15.049> things<00:02:15.080> and

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
find out how we can make new things and

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.790 
find out how we can make new things and
what<00:02:15.950> are<00:02:16.069> these<00:02:16.189> new<00:02:16.489> things<00:02:16.700> going<00:02:17.060> to<00:02:17.209> do

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
what are these new things going to do

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.100 
what are these new things going to do
we<00:02:18.370> were<00:02:18.550> trying<00:02:18.910> to<00:02:19.120> address<00:02:19.420> a<00:02:19.450> challenge<00:02:19.960> of

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
we were trying to address a challenge of

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.830 
we were trying to address a challenge of
how<00:02:20.320> do<00:02:20.380> you<00:02:20.530> take<00:02:20.910> molecules<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.180> makeup<00:02:22.630> of

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
how do you take molecules the makeup of
