Doppler<00:00:44.219> radars<00:00:44.640> this<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.239> just<00:00:45.480> one<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.780> them

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
Doppler radars this is just one of them

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.049 
Doppler radars this is just one of them
it's<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.620> rabid<00:00:47.039> scan<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.610> what<00:00:47.730> they<00:00:47.850> do<00:00:47.910> is

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
it's a rabid scan and what they do is

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.400 
it's a rabid scan and what they do is
they<00:00:48.270> get<00:00:48.360> several<00:00:48.690> kilometers<00:00:49.140> from<00:00:49.260> the

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
they get several kilometers from the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.840 
they get several kilometers from the
tornado<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.980> then<00:00:50.190> they<00:00:50.309> start<00:00:50.520> scanning

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
tornado and then they start scanning

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.189 
tornado and then they start scanning
with<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.180> radar<00:00:51.390> just<00:00:51.629> like<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:51.930> would<00:00:52.050> see<00:00:52.170> a

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
with the radar just like you would see a

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.110 
with the radar just like you would see a
radar<00:00:52.620> at<00:00:52.800> an<00:00:53.129> airport<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.730> they<00:00:53.969> get

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
radar at an airport and they get

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.760 
radar at an airport and they get
tremendous<00:00:54.480> data<00:00:54.899> from<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.260> tornado<00:00:55.469> itself

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
tremendous data from the tornado itself

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.279 
tremendous data from the tornado itself
but<00:00:56.370> that's<00:00:56.670> not<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.090> dangerous<00:00:57.570> job<00:00:57.870> Alex

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
but that's not the dangerous job Alex

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.319 
but that's not the dangerous job Alex
the<00:00:58.559> dangerous<00:00:58.949> job<00:00:59.250> are<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.910> teams<00:01:00.210> that

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
the dangerous job are the teams that

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.420 
the dangerous job are the teams that
deployed<00:01:00.750> these<00:01:00.989> probes<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.710> what<00:01:02.100> they<00:01:02.219> have

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
deployed these probes and what they have

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.039 
deployed these probes and what they have
to<00:01:02.579> do<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.730> actually<00:01:03.090> get<00:01:03.300> right<00:01:03.629> on<00:01:03.899> the

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
to do is actually get right on the

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.350 
to do is actually get right on the
tornados<00:01:04.589> edge<00:01:04.860> these<00:01:05.309> weigh<00:01:05.580> over<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.939> hundred

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
tornados edge these weigh over a hundred

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.149 
tornados edge these weigh over a hundred
pounds<00:01:06.869> they<00:01:07.110> measure<00:01:07.320> wind<00:01:07.740> speed<00:01:07.830> and

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
pounds they measure wind speed and

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.310 
pounds they measure wind speed and
temperature<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.270> they<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:10.020> gets

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
temperature and they this gets

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.410 
temperature and they this gets
tremendous<00:01:11.070> surface<00:01:11.460> data<00:01:11.700> from<00:01:12.090> very<00:01:12.330> very

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
tremendous surface data from very very

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.880 
tremendous surface data from very very
close<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.080> tornado<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:13.590> they<00:01:13.710> get<00:01:13.830> in

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
close to the tornado so they get in

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.440 
close to the tornado so they get in
there<00:01:14.100> they<00:01:14.369> deploy<00:01:14.670> them<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.000> they<00:01:15.150> get<00:01:15.330> out

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
there they deploy them and they get out

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.240 
there they deploy them and they get out
as<00:01:15.600> fast<00:01:15.630> as<00:01:15.990> possible<00:01:16.259> they<00:01:16.770> also<00:01:16.920> measure

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
as fast as possible they also measure

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.100 
as fast as possible they also measure
precipitation<00:01:18.030> with<00:01:18.150> this<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.509> very<00:01:18.900> high-tech

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
precipitation with this a very high-tech

actually a laser beam between there and

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.350 
actually a laser beam between there and
measures<00:01:23.460> precipitation<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.210> falls

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
measures precipitation that falls

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.719

and<00:01:34.200> why<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.680> tornadoes<00:01:35.159> but<00:01:35.310> believe<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.729> or

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
and why of tornadoes but believe it or

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.789 
and why of tornadoes but believe it or
not<00:01:35.880> we<00:01:36.329> know<00:01:36.479> very<00:01:36.509> little<00:01:37.049> about<00:01:37.229> right<00:01:37.619> now

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
not we know very little about right now

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.499 
not we know very little about right now
and<00:01:38.189> one<00:01:38.369> thing<00:01:38.520> they<00:01:38.640> want<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.880> do<00:01:39.000> alex<00:01:39.390> is

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
and one thing they want to do alex is

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.030 
and one thing they want to do alex is
reduce<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.259> number<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.500> false<00:01:40.770> warnings

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
reduce the number of false warnings

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.859 
reduce the number of false warnings
which<00:01:41.579> right<00:01:41.850> now<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.150> this<00:01:42.240> country<00:01:42.659> is

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
which right now in this country is

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.530 
which right now in this country is
seventy<00:01:43.649> percent<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.820> lot<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.030> reason<00:01:45.450> why

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
seventy percent and a lot of reason why

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.179 
seventy percent and a lot of reason why
people<00:01:45.840> don't<00:01:46.020> take<00:01:46.170> tornado<00:01:46.799> warnings<00:01:47.100> all

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
people don't take tornado warnings all

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.770 
people don't take tornado warnings all
that<00:01:47.369> seriously<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:48.030> they're<00:01:48.360> trying<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.659> get

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
that seriously so they're trying to get

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.660 
that seriously so they're trying to get
those<00:01:48.990> numbers<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.439> improve<00:01:49.770> here<00:01:50.040> for<00:01:50.490> more

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
those numbers to improve here for more

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.670 
those numbers to improve here for more
weeks<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.060> go<00:01:51.090> haven't<00:01:51.840> seen<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.020> tornado<00:01:52.290> yet

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
weeks to go haven't seen a tornado yet

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.300 
weeks to go haven't seen a tornado yet
but<00:01:52.799> they're<00:01:52.920> keeping<00:01:53.159> their<00:01:53.250> fingers

zero<00:02:45.520> unfortunately<00:02:46.420> we're<00:02:46.750> hoping<00:02:47.020> the<00:02:47.140> luck

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
zero unfortunately we're hoping the luck

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.080 
zero unfortunately we're hoping the luck
will<00:02:47.500> change<00:02:47.530> early<00:02:48.310> next<00:02:48.520> week<00:02:48.730> the

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
will change early next week the

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.910 
will change early next week the
atmosphere<00:02:49.660> is<00:02:49.720> just<00:02:49.900> not<00:02:50.080> cooperating<00:02:50.260> and

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
atmosphere is just not cooperating and

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.370 
atmosphere is just not cooperating and
so<00:02:51.400> instrumentation<00:02:52.240> like<00:02:52.540> this<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:53.020> rapid

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
so instrumentation like this the rapid

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.860 
so instrumentation like this the rapid
scan<00:02:53.650> radars<00:02:54.250> and<00:02:54.460> all<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.240> dowels<00:02:55.480> that<00:02:55.750> you

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
scan radars and all the dowels that you

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.990 
scan radars and all the dowels that you
see<00:02:56.050> here<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.380> dopplers<00:02:56.860> on<00:02:57.070> wheels<00:02:57.430> they<00:02:57.850> are

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
see here the dopplers on wheels they are

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.090 
see here the dopplers on wheels they are
just<00:02:58.330> not<00:02:58.450> getting<00:02:58.990> the<00:02:59.200> data<00:02:59.560> that<00:02:59.800> they<00:02:59.920> need

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
just not getting the data that they need

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.860 
just not getting the data that they need
because<00:03:00.310> the<00:03:00.880> atmosphere<00:03:01.030> is<00:03:01.390> not<00:03:01.570> giving

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
because the atmosphere is not giving

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.510 
because the atmosphere is not giving
them<00:03:01.990> a<00:03:02.050> tornado<00:03:02.410> but<00:03:02.620> I<00:03:02.800> do<00:03:02.920> want<00:03:03.220> to<00:03:03.310> show<00:03:03.460> you

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
them a tornado but I do want to show you

went through that and you survived I

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.220 
went through that and you survived I
think<00:04:09.010> you've<00:04:09.160> done<00:04:09.190> okay<00:04:09.489> right<00:04:10.030> so<00:04:10.360> if<00:04:11.019> we
