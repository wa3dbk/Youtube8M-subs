00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.880
 few runners choose to dissociate 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.050
 slow training and fast running in 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.690
 the choice of their shoes 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.299
 most frequently long course with a 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.190
 one and the same model that we make 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.939
 jogging quick intervals or even 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.550
 competitions for questions of 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.590
 performance especially and prevention 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.840
 also it is advisable to 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.179
 operate with several pairs among 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.420
 which a more dynamic shoe 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.820
 in this register the trainer of asics 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.070
 declined in neutral or stable version and 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.690
 probably the best known model is 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.510
 best suited to popular runners 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.250
 eager to explore new ways 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.899
 we are more and more today in 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.910
 the advent of minimalism with 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.920
 Straight 2 0 shoes that helps 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.449
 tilt on the front of the foot but the 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.610
 people who are not used gets hurt 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.199
 what should be learned to run at 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.980
 upstream we have the curriculum or 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.899
 training 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.579
 some people blame are afraid 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.480
 lack of dynamism or lack of 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.340
 speed 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.769
 there we are sure years super compromise between 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.689
 the shoe 2-0 minimalist the curriculum 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.340
 or drive it will allow to 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.540
 make the transition and win in 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.280
 energy in dynamism 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.810
 it's always the same story to find 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.360
 a compromise between comfort and 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.180
 cushioning between safety and softness 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.000
 it is also an ideal shoe for the 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.650
 runner said popular from 10 km up to 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.850
 half marathon or more because she 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.500
 will allow this compromise 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.060
 between competition training 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.560
 it's one of the few that allows that 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.340
 precisely to have it is this switchover 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.020
 meaning and shoes too heavy between a 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.439
 classic cushioning shoe and a 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:41.490
 type model DS Trainer There are about 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:44.369
 70 g difference is 20 to 25 % of the 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.320
 total weight of the shoe a gap that 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.659
 at the finish of a race is reflected 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.290
 clearly as experienced our 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.360
 tester of the month i come back from london 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.170
 that I ran and ran the world that is 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.060
 so much 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.680
 my fifth marathon I did two 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.350
 once new york once berlin once 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.350
 chicago the first four I 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.810
 always ran enough shoes 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.989
 are comfortable without taking great 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.950
 risks we'll say and there I counted 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.239
 even a little more shoes 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.950
 dynamic a little lighter in 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.720
 the occurrence the asturias nerves of 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.300
 10.6 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.209
 and then here is the bet turned out 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.489
 winner already tested once on a 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.500
 long exit of 28 km is here I have them 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.150
 put there are raised on the 42 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.519
 kilometers with a good result 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.299
 the occurrence 3h21 because it was my 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:34.769
 best my best result 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:36.360
 I still felt the difference in 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.160
 the sense that I had a stride it when 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.860
 even more dynamic I had more more 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.930
 the impression of discovering on the front of 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.600
 course about to have to have me 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.700
 the heavy step of having the impression 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:54.020
 of double to leave on the sale to have 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:57.100
 a crowd is more lighter marathon 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.840
 it's charming you're angry is you 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.640
 choose the beautiful option 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.130
 I think so unless I took 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.350
 15 pounds in the round ass I lost 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.980
 a few to go under the bar 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:12.050
 81 kg so no to equal weight 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.800
 equal training equal ambitions I 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.800
 think that I myself
