00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 Mount Olympus is the highest mountain of the sun. 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.980
 system rises to 21,000 meters above 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.530
 the surface of mars is approximately 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.480
 two and a half height of everest on earth 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.910
 you would need a spacesuit to 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.070
 survive at that height and in general can 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.260
 the mountains on our home planet be like that 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.390
 high if you take into account the strength 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.750
 attraction density and rock strength 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.150
 in principle, you can create a conical mount 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.130
 extending from new york to chicago and 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.769
 towering over 45 kilometers 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.260
 it is twice as high as Olympus and certainly does 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.480
 everest is tiny however there are a few 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.579
 The reasons why such a huge mountain is not 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.469
 may exist on earth first 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.719
 the reason is that the earth 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.910
 the crust consists of continental plates 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.160
 Essences floating on a semi-solid mantle 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.440
 if you increase the weight on the surface of the 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.690
 the plates will sink deeper into the hot mantle 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.210
 rather plunging deep enough 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.010
 soften and eventually melt it 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.340
 sets the limits of our conical 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.530
 the mountains are only 15 kilometers away also powerful 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.870
 collisions of tectonic plates which 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.090
 creates mountains forms cracks and rifts 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.520
 in the threshold that weaken the structure 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.320
 core and leads to rose and repetitive 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.720
 over millions of years cycles 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.299
 freezing taiwan enhance effect 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.780
 these cracks at the same time winds sharpen 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.060
 the slopes 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.460
 and brooks and glaciers cut deep 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.380
 the valleys are increasingly weakening a couple of mountains and 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.979
 all this can end badly 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.390
 for example, the top of 3760 is four meters 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.640
 mountains of cook in new zealand one night 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.530
 1991 just from the floor lowering its height to 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.280
 3 thousand seven hundred fifty four 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.860
 meters 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.140
 considering all the factors limiting the mountains 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.750
 in height such as melting plates in the mantle 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.030
 land crack and rosi I would not put on 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.220
 what our highest mountains will become 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.619
 much higher than they are but on the other 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.259
 side of everest is still growing and through 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.579
 50 years he will be 30 centimeters taller 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.890
 than today or 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.899
 from him fall off a big piece making 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.090
 its much lower we can only 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.369
 wait to find out it yes and who 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.150
 knows maybe by the time we already 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.119
 will visit Mars 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.710
 I want to express special thanks 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.720
 subscribers on patreon.com who 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.400
 help the existence of this channel 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.440
