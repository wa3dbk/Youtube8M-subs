eyes and then blending it so yeah I'm
gonna<00:01:57.540> just<00:01:57.750> try<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:59.180> so<00:02:00.180> yes<00:02:00.689> I'm<00:02:00.960> just

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
gonna just try that so yes I'm just

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.929

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
gonna go for it just you know you know

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.899 
gonna go for it just you know you know
okay<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:04.049> was<00:02:04.259> not<00:02:04.560> as<00:02:04.680> much<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.520> sweeping

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
okay that was not as much of a sweeping

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.069 
okay that was not as much of a sweeping
action<00:02:06.270> as<00:02:06.390> I<00:02:06.479> thought<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.810> was<00:02:06.899> gonna<00:02:06.990> be

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
action as I thought it was gonna be

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.930 
action as I thought it was gonna be
because<00:02:07.920> this<00:02:08.069> is<00:02:08.190> kind<00:02:08.429> of<00:02:08.459> like<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.640> rubber

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
because this is kind of like a rubber

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.930 
because this is kind of like a rubber
material<00:02:09.690> it's<00:02:10.140> kind<00:02:10.259> of<00:02:10.289> hard<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.530> sweep<00:02:10.940> okay

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940
