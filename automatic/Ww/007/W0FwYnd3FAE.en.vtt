00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:13.830
 and youtube people will help you in 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.830
 decision therein of your samsung s4 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.939
 people ask me what I s4 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:25.320
 should i buy the octa runs the 3g or quad 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.210
 4g core really a very doubt 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.890
 because many people do not know how to 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.040
 difference between them two 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.260
 What is the main difference between them? 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.270
 this is the process which is the adoption 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.790
 another then a running fan runs and gets 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.420
 wheel up to 3g frequency the other only 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.649
 up to the 4g frequency but this is the 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.879
 what color will it be that's it all fear not 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:53.039
 It's something to try to get attention. 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.500
 because they say this kind of work well 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.539
 It's now here, there's not much left. 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.629
 No, what is it? 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.300
 another package is of course eight cores only 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:09.600
 which for simple tasks runs only 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:12.210
 four cores running the comtex at 7 and 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:17.150
 for very heavy tasks like games 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:21.720
 heavy if you use the cortex processor 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:24.869
 a15 to the other four other nuclei 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.780
 ornament on cordex frequency at 15 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.689
 if eight were actually used 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:35.909
 at the same time the battery of it 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:39.540
 Aquino would last for nothing then 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:42.360
 issues about what is now here not 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.570
 It has a lot of change because it has a little 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.750
 change in the issue of improvement and 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.979
 has more performance than others has ever been 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.409
 proven 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:56.460
 only that the performance is so small that 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:02:04.229
 it does not affect anything then to say a thousand 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:06.869
 tutu nothing but that which runs the 4g wheel 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:10.729
 Calm, so do not have any 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:14.060
 drastic processing difference of 1 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:18.650
 another on the issue of 4g 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.840
 It is clear that in Brazil 4g has to 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.870
 to mature the quality of services 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.650
 provided to Brazilian society 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:31.489
 in network 2g and 3g are still precarious 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.650
 and do not satisfactorily meet the 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.590
 amount of customers that is a 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:41.420
 huge need you have 3g network 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:44.629
 but companies do not give a good 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:48.709
 infrastructure and does not provide a 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:50.750
 good sign of 2g 3g 4g 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:54.079
 the plans have still to live in ink 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.870
 button also more people the 4g brings more 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:58.940
 quality and speed the speed of 4 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.879
 gb best upload 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:08.540
 but who will provide you with this service? 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:11.829
 The better the technology, the better it 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:15.139
 technology has not improved. 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:18.169
 still horrible so it's not worth it 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:21.049
 you use the 4g handset but the 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:22.669
 price difference is so small is and at 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:25.760
 Sometimes you can find the same 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:29.630
 appeared all the value that goes here in 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.389
 ditches option type 5 the cs4 plus or 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.669
 less there in my opinion I was 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:37.069
 seeing in my head that the 4g in the 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:44.180
 Brazil will only stay cool as 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:49.609
 3g there for 2015 2016 he will start 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:53.870
 to have real features of you 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:57.260
 turn on your 4g it work 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:02.840
 so that's it there is my opinion but if 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:05.209
 You want to be 14 and soon you are and 4g to power. 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.489
 Let's say we have a more 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:11.989
 advance today with s4 the four most 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:14.449
 advanced but will only be the s4 until 2016 and 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:17.299
 will have your s4c there and probably 

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:19.700
 I hope you have a very good and 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.989
 the next launched here he always 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.250
 update for android more 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.270
 newspaper that he has great 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.750
 processing 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:30.030
 That's it guys so it's my tip. 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.310
 For you then it is clear that this 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:36.449
 processor that now my ok from the court 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:38.280
 does not work simultaneously or 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:41.250
 either it is not a processor that agrees 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:45.840
 exhaustion here that works wonders is a 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:49.530
 good processor but that is only used 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.240
 quadcore then quadcore so he has 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.849
 almost the same the other is already quad 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:57.180
 core 1.9 so do not have this deal 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:59.550
 to change the beauty cuts that's it 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.259
 Friends I tried to talk a little brief 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.360
 few things without having many 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:06.120
 total knowledge of processing in 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.280
 ropes on several things is 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.110
 I want to bring cool videos to you. 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.270
 I hope you have taken some questions. 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.740
 someone 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:17.669
 leave your question in the comments I 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.770
 Can I answer to you and that's it? 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:22.650
 guys, I broke the technician trying 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.990
