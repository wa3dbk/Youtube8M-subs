missed that video i suggest you go check
it<00:00:24.470> out<00:00:24.529> so<00:00:24.710> i<00:00:24.740> don't<00:00:24.919> have<00:00:24.949> to<00:00:25.070> do<00:00:25.189> the<00:00:25.310> whole

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
it out so i don't have to do the whole

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.399 
it out so i don't have to do the whole
intro<00:00:25.939> again<00:00:26.119> but<00:00:26.480> basically<00:00:26.869> we're<00:00:27.169> going

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:27.409 
intro again but basically we're going

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:30.669 
intro again but basically we're going
off<00:00:27.560> that<00:00:28.099> source<00:00:28.609> that<00:00:29.240> uh<00:00:29.269> that<00:00:30.079> brazilian

off that source that uh that brazilian
source<00:00:31.009> that<00:00:31.249> said<00:00:31.579> the<00:00:31.759> co-op<00:00:32.060> mode<00:00:32.270> begins

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:32.630

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
basically this video is about epidemic

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.870 
basically this video is about epidemic
epidemic<00:00:55.280> now<00:00:56.650> epidemic<00:00:57.650> would<00:00:58.010> like<00:00:58.700> it

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:58.880 
epidemic now epidemic would like it

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.610 
epidemic now epidemic would like it
sound<00:00:59.180> and<00:00:59.480> set<00:00:59.660> it<00:00:59.780> sounds<00:01:00.080> like<00:01:00.170> a<00:01:00.230> disease

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
sound and set it sounds like a disease

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.200 
sound and set it sounds like a disease
it<00:01:00.860> sounds<00:01:01.130> like<00:01:01.220> a<00:01:01.280> disease<00:01:01.550> now<00:01:01.820> this<00:01:01.970> fits

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
it sounds like a disease now this fits

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.810 
it sounds like a disease now this fits
really<00:01:02.510> well<00:01:02.690> with<00:01:03.290> what<00:01:03.680> my<00:01:03.860> previous

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
really well with what my previous

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.640 
really well with what my previous
theories<00:01:05.330> were<00:01:05.509> about<00:01:05.750> mutants<00:01:06.259> being<00:01:06.560> the

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
theories were about mutants being the

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.060 
theories were about mutants being the
co-op<00:01:06.920> mode<00:01:07.130> and<00:01:07.310> such<00:01:07.570> and<00:01:08.570> and<00:01:08.920> like<00:01:09.920> a

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
co-op mode and such and and like a

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.640 
co-op mode and such and and like a
disease<00:01:10.640> sort<00:01:11.060> of<00:01:11.150> like<00:01:11.299> the<00:01:11.509> last<00:01:11.750> shift<00:01:12.110> TV

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
disease sort of like the last shift TV

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.750 
disease sort of like the last shift TV
show<00:01:12.890> on<00:01:13.070> tnt<00:01:13.430> which<00:01:13.610> is<00:01:13.940> pretty<00:01:14.210> awesome<00:01:14.600> but

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
show on tnt which is pretty awesome but

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.550 
show on tnt which is pretty awesome but
this<00:01:16.760> game-mode<00:01:17.150> would<00:01:17.659> be<00:01:17.840> really<00:01:18.380> really

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
this game-mode would be really really

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.110 
this game-mode would be really really
interesting<00:01:19.010> in<00:01:19.340> my<00:01:19.370> opinion<00:01:19.640> it<00:01:19.880> would<00:01:20.060> be

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.120 
interesting in my opinion it would be

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.720 
interesting in my opinion it would be
zombies<00:01:20.930> but<00:01:21.200> not<00:01:21.470> zombies<00:01:22.250> their<00:01:22.520> Mahr

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
zombies but not zombies their Mahr

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.250 
zombies but not zombies their Mahr
they're<00:01:22.909> not<00:01:23.060> exactly<00:01:23.510> zombies<00:01:24.050> they're

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
they're not exactly zombies they're

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.600 
they're not exactly zombies they're
mutated<00:01:24.920> humans<00:01:25.400> from<00:01:25.610> some<00:01:25.940> mutated<00:01:26.659> genetic

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
mutated humans from some mutated genetic

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.880 
mutated humans from some mutated genetic
altering<00:01:28.610> disease<00:01:29.210> that<00:01:29.870> ghosts<00:01:30.320> and<00:01:30.470> passes

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
altering disease that ghosts and passes

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.800 
altering disease that ghosts and passes
through<00:01:31.070> everyone<00:01:31.460> but<00:01:31.670> you're<00:01:32.180> fighting<00:01:32.659> is

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
through everyone but you're fighting is

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.110 
through everyone but you're fighting is
for<00:01:33.170> people<00:01:33.650> trying<00:01:34.010> to<00:01:34.280> find<00:01:34.550> the<00:01:34.760> cure<00:01:35.090> and

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120 
for people trying to find the cure and

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.149 
for people trying to find the cure and
then<00:01:35.600> maybe<00:01:35.840> you<00:01:35.990> find<00:01:36.380> a<00:01:36.530> ship<00:01:36.590> and<00:01:37.040> then

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
then maybe you find a ship and then

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:38.860 
then maybe you find a ship and then
maybe<00:01:37.430> you<00:01:37.580> find<00:01:37.909> some<00:01:38.150> other<00:01:38.210> people<00:01:38.659> and

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
maybe you find some other people and

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.200 
maybe you find some other people and
then<00:01:38.960> it<00:01:39.440> goes<00:01:39.680> all<00:01:39.860> walking<00:01:40.220> dead<00:01:40.640> and<00:01:40.880> people

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
then it goes all walking dead and people

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.210 
then it goes all walking dead and people
betray<00:01:41.630> you<00:01:41.690> and<00:01:41.990> everyone<00:01:42.290> starts<00:01:42.830> dying

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
betray you and everyone starts dying

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.300 
betray you and everyone starts dying
that's<00:01:43.729> that's<00:01:44.479> really<00:01:45.320> the<00:01:45.470> driving<00:01:45.650> force

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
that's that's really the driving force

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.050 
that's that's really the driving force
behind<00:01:46.430> my<00:01:46.970> idea<00:01:47.360> here<00:01:47.720> and<00:01:48.460> whether<00:01:49.460> whether

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
behind my idea here and whether whether

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.060 
behind my idea here and whether whether
it's<00:01:50.330> that<00:01:50.540> or<00:01:50.960> whether<00:01:51.080> it's<00:01:51.290> not<00:01:51.470> I<00:01:51.770> mean

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
it's that or whether it's not I mean

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.130 
it's that or whether it's not I mean
chances<00:01:53.060> are<00:01:53.180> it's<00:01:53.360> not<00:01:53.510> going<00:01:53.720> to<00:01:53.810> be<00:01:53.900> called

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
chances are it's not going to be called

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.410 
chances are it's not going to be called
epidemic<00:01:54.770> I'm<00:01:54.950> just<00:01:55.100> making<00:01:55.490> videos<00:01:55.820> try<00:01:56.360> to

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
epidemic I'm just making videos try to

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.420 
epidemic I'm just making videos try to
bounce<00:01:56.690> ideas<00:01:56.960> around<00:01:57.260> see<00:01:57.920> if<00:01:57.950> we<00:01:58.100> can<00:01:58.250> come
