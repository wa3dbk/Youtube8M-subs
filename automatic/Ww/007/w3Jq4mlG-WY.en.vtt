embrace what is charging like we have

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.620 
embrace what is charging like we have

have<00:02:08.849> two<00:02:09.149> options<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.750> Samson<00:02:10.440> can<00:02:10.619> go<00:02:10.800> with

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
have two options that Samson can go with

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.400 
have two options that Samson can go with
again<00:02:11.670> it's<00:02:11.910> known<00:02:12.390> that<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:13.080> S

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
again it's known that the S

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.350 
again it's known that the S
for<00:02:13.530> is<00:02:13.770> going<00:02:14.010> to<00:02:14.070> have<00:02:14.310> a<00:02:14.610> very<00:02:15.030> powerful

for is going to have a very powerful

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.250 
for is going to have a very powerful
processor<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.280> Samsung<00:02:17.280> might<00:02:17.520> have<00:02:18.330> two

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
processor and Samsung might have two

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.470 
processor and Samsung might have two
variants<00:02:19.740> I'm<00:02:19.950> not<00:02:20.100> very<00:02:20.220> sure<00:02:20.340> let<00:02:21.240> me<00:02:21.360> talk

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.450 
variants I'm not very sure let me talk
about<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:21.990> I<00:02:22.020> I<00:02:22.200> believe<00:02:22.800> that<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.190> first

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
about it the I I believe that the first

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.300 
about it the I I believe that the first
variant<00:02:23.790> Samson<00:02:24.270> can<00:02:24.540> put<00:02:24.870> up<00:02:25.050> eight<00:02:25.800> good

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
variant Samson can put up eight good

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
octa core yes eight course again it's

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.490 
octa core yes eight course again it's
not<00:02:32.550> a<00:02:32.610> fully<00:02:32.970> eight-core<00:02:33.540> processor<00:02:33.570> again

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
not a fully eight-core processor again

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.740 
not a fully eight-core processor again
it's<00:02:34.650> divided<00:02:35.100> into<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:36.030> first<00:02:36.270> four<00:02:36.510> cores

it's divided into the first four cores
will<00:02:37.020> be<00:02:37.230> what<00:02:37.740> do<00:02:37.800> you<00:02:37.860> say<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.340> cortex<00:02:38.810> a15

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
will be what do you say the cortex a15

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.260 
will be what do you say the cortex a15
based<00:02:40.380> and<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:41.130> other<00:02:41.340> four<00:02:41.610> cores<00:02:41.880> will<00:02:42.120> be

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
based and the other four cores will be

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.360 
based and the other four cores will be
based<00:02:42.450> on<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.870> cortex<00:02:43.260> a7<00:02:43.440> architecture

based on the cortex a7 architecture
again<00:02:45.090> I'm<00:02:45.240> not<00:02:45.420> very<00:02:45.630> sure<00:02:45.780> because<00:02:46.230> earlier

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
again I'm not very sure because earlier

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.150 
again I'm not very sure because earlier
this<00:02:47.220> platform<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:48.540> octa-core<00:02:48.900> was<00:02:49.410> mostly

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
this platform the octa-core was mostly

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.340 
this platform the octa-core was mostly
designed<00:02:50.460> for<00:02:50.730> tablets<00:02:51.000> but<00:02:51.540> again<00:02:51.810> we<00:02:51.960> never

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
designed for tablets but again we never

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.350 
designed for tablets but again we never
know<00:02:52.560> we<00:02:53.190> might<00:02:53.430> see<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:53.760> eight<00:02:54.060> core<00:02:54.330> phone

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
know we might see a eight core phone

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.710 
know we might see a eight core phone
from<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.860> s4<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.850> second<00:02:57.210> option<00:02:57.420> that

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
from the s4 the second option that

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.130 
from the s4 the second option that
Samson<00:02:58.200> could<00:02:58.410> go<00:02:58.650> with<00:02:58.890> is<00:02:59.100> the<00:02:59.280> Qualcomm<00:02:59.910> s

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
Samson could go with is the Qualcomm s

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.500 
Samson could go with is the Qualcomm s
600<00:03:01.140> processor<00:03:01.380> this<00:03:02.160> is<00:03:02.340> an<00:03:02.490> updated<00:03:03.150> model

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
600 processor this is an updated model

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.320 
600 processor this is an updated model
to<00:03:03.960> the<00:03:03.990> hugely<00:03:04.350> popular<00:03:04.730> s4<00:03:05.730> pro<00:03:06.090> and

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
to the hugely popular s4 pro and

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.840 
to the hugely popular s4 pro and
Qualcomm<00:03:07.110> claims<00:03:07.380> that<00:03:07.620> it's<00:03:07.980> around<00:03:08.340> forty

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
Qualcomm claims that it's around forty

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.090 
Qualcomm claims that it's around forty
percent<00:03:09.180> faster<00:03:09.420> than<00:03:09.750> s4<00:03:10.200> pro<00:03:10.410> which<00:03:10.860> is

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
percent faster than s4 pro which is

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.000 
percent faster than s4 pro which is
again<00:03:11.940> s4<00:03:12.330> is<00:03:12.480> a<00:03:12.510> very<00:03:12.900> fast<00:03:13.200> processor<00:03:13.650> so

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
again s4 is a very fast processor so

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.670 
again s4 is a very fast processor so
again<00:03:14.460> I<00:03:14.670> firmly<00:03:15.330> believe<00:03:15.750> that<00:03:15.780> Samsung

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
again I firmly believe that Samsung

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.460 
again I firmly believe that Samsung
might<00:03:16.920> go<00:03:17.160> between<00:03:17.790> one<00:03:18.209> of<00:03:18.330> these<00:03:18.750> or<00:03:18.959> again

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
might go between one of these or again

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.740 
might go between one of these or again
like<00:03:19.709> last<00:03:19.740> year<00:03:20.220> they<00:03:20.370> did<00:03:20.520> with<00:03:20.700> s3<00:03:21.209> for

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
like last year they did with s3 for

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.870 
like last year they did with s3 for
example<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.290> international<00:03:22.830> variant<00:03:23.160> of<00:03:23.340> s3

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
example the international variant of s3

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.699 
example the international variant of s3
that<00:03:24.270> we<00:03:24.420> see<00:03:24.570> an<00:03:24.630> asian<00:03:24.840> other<00:03:25.320> countries

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
that we see an asian other countries

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.010 
that we see an asian other countries
come<00:03:26.130> came<00:03:26.940> with<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.180> quad<00:03:27.390> core<00:03:27.570> processor

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
come came with the quad core processor

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.990 
come came with the quad core processor
and<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.260> US<00:03:29.100> version<00:03:29.280> came<00:03:29.640> with<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.850> dual

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
and the US version came with the dual

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.449 
and the US version came with the dual
core<00:03:30.209> processor<00:03:30.240> so<00:03:30.870> Samson<00:03:31.380> might<00:03:31.770> do

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
core processor so Samson might do

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.280 
core processor so Samson might do
something<00:03:32.700> like<00:03:32.940> that<00:03:33.000> again<00:03:33.209> again<00:03:33.930> I'm<00:03:34.110> not

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
something like that again again I'm not

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.260 
something like that again again I'm not
very<00:03:34.470> sure<00:03:34.590> so<00:03:35.430> what<00:03:35.640> do<00:03:35.730> you<00:03:35.820> think<00:03:36.030> several

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
very sure so what do you think several

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.330 
very sure so what do you think several
Samsung<00:03:36.780> go<00:03:36.900> with<00:03:37.080> the<00:03:37.200> octa-core<00:03:37.980> that's

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
Samsung go with the octa-core that's

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.520 
Samsung go with the octa-core that's
eight<00:03:38.610> core<00:03:38.820> processor<00:03:39.300> or<00:03:39.420> they<00:03:40.050> will<00:03:40.170> stick

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
eight core processor or they will stick

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.220 
eight core processor or they will stick
with<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:41.040> quad<00:03:41.820> core<00:03:42.030> processor<00:03:42.450> for<00:03:42.630> the<00:03:42.720> s4

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230

that Samsung phones are mostly
plastically<00:04:21.120> in<00:04:21.330> feel<00:04:21.510> and<00:04:21.539> some<00:04:21.840> people

don't<00:04:22.289> like<00:04:22.350> the<00:04:22.620> fact<00:04:22.830> will<00:04:23.340> it<00:04:23.460> change<00:04:23.669> with

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
don't like the fact will it change with

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.740 
don't like the fact will it change with
the<00:04:24.000> s4<00:04:24.330> will<00:04:24.840> it<00:04:24.990> have<00:04:25.229> something

the s4 will it have something
else<00:04:25.960> do<00:04:26.110> you<00:04:26.200> think<00:04:26.410> they<00:04:27.190> might<00:04:27.400> introduce

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
else do you think they might introduce

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.460 
else do you think they might introduce
some<00:04:28.090> mental<00:04:28.450> aspects<00:04:28.900> or<00:04:29.050> again<00:04:29.260> do<00:04:29.380> you

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
some mental aspects or again do you

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.380 
some mental aspects or again do you
think<00:04:29.500> again<00:04:30.130> it<00:04:30.250> will<00:04:30.310> be<00:04:30.430> again<00:04:30.670> a<00:04:30.730> plastic

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
think again it will be again a plastic

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.320 
think again it will be again a plastic
feel<00:04:32.010> regarding<00:04:33.010> the<00:04:33.250> looks<00:04:33.700> I<00:04:33.910> don't<00:04:34.240> think

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
feel regarding the looks I don't think

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.540 
feel regarding the looks I don't think
so<00:04:34.540> oh<00:04:35.080> they<00:04:35.680> might<00:04:35.860> change<00:04:36.160> it<00:04:36.490> a<00:04:36.520> lot<00:04:37.260> again

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
so oh they might change it a lot again

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.880 
so oh they might change it a lot again
again<00:04:39.550> it's<00:04:40.030> open<00:04:40.630> to<00:04:40.750> speculation<00:04:40.930> but<00:04:41.740> I

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
again it's open to speculation but I

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.280 
again it's open to speculation but I
don't<00:04:42.520> think<00:04:42.760> so<00:04:43.000> we<00:04:43.180> will<00:04:43.360> see<00:04:43.600> design

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
don't think so we will see design

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.250 
don't think so we will see design
elements<00:04:44.740> like<00:04:44.890> we<00:04:45.250> have<00:04:45.340> seen<00:04:45.550> in<00:04:45.700> s2<00:04:46.210> with<00:04:46.630> s4

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
elements like we have seen in s2 with s4

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.620 
elements like we have seen in s2 with s4
and<00:04:47.560> the<00:04:47.920> last<00:04:48.250> thing<00:04:48.580> that<00:04:48.640> I<00:04:49.000> am<00:04:49.270> NOT<00:04:49.450> very

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
and the last thing that I am NOT very

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.500 
and the last thing that I am NOT very
sure<00:04:49.780> is<00:04:50.230> do<00:04:50.620> you<00:04:50.740> think<00:04:50.980> that<00:04:51.130> Sampson<00:04:51.760> will

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510

go with the nano-sim for the s4 or stick
with<00:04:56.260> the<00:04:56.850> microcell<00:04:57.850> so<00:04:58.540> these<00:04:58.780> are<00:04:58.990> some<00:04:59.020> of
