00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:38.710 
theory for a moment yeah it's been my

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.820 
theory for a moment yeah it's been my
experience<00:06:40.020> and<00:06:41.020> of<00:06:41.260> course<00:06:41.470> I<00:06:41.620> don't<00:06:41.680> have

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:41.830 
experience and of course I don't have

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.770 
experience and of course I don't have
near<00:06:42.070> as<00:06:42.130> much<00:06:42.340> as<00:06:42.400> you<00:06:42.700> do<00:06:42.880> so<00:06:43.090> you<00:06:43.120> correct<00:06:43.720> me

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:43.780 
near as much as you do so you correct me

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.810 
near as much as you do so you correct me
if<00:06:43.990> I'm<00:06:44.170> wrong<00:06:44.200> but<00:06:44.740> I've<00:06:45.190> come<00:06:45.550> to<00:06:45.580> the

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:45.820 
if I'm wrong but I've come to the

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:51.780 
if I'm wrong but I've come to the
assumption<00:06:46.510> that<00:06:47.730> the<00:06:48.730> old<00:06:48.940> Dabo<00:06:49.480> stock<00:06:50.790> was

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:51.790 
assumption that the old Dabo stock was

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:55.080 
assumption that the old Dabo stock was
pretty<00:06:52.090> late<00:06:52.390> starting<00:06:53.580> tend<00:06:54.580> to<00:06:54.730> get<00:06:54.880> a<00:06:54.940> lot

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:55.090 
pretty late starting tend to get a lot

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.780 
pretty late starting tend to get a lot
of<00:06:55.270> coal<00:06:55.510> dogs<00:06:55.870> in<00:06:56.320> that<00:06:56.830> line<00:06:57.310> is<00:06:57.640> that

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:57.790 
of coal dogs in that line is that

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.710 
of coal dogs in that line is that
correct<00:06:58.150> I<00:06:58.510> don't<00:06:58.930> know<00:06:59.350> that<00:06:59.650> you<00:06:59.860> got

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720
