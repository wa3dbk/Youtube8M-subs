00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
what I do here surround the base tune

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.060 
what I do here surround the base tune
going<00:02:32.900> stock<00:02:33.900> injectors<00:02:34.380> I'll<00:02:34.500> swap<00:02:34.710> into<00:02:34.920> our

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
going stock injectors I'll swap into our

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.990 
going stock injectors I'll swap into our
c5<00:02:35.550> 50s<00:02:35.970> in<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:36.180> bit<00:02:36.740> you<00:02:37.740> can<00:02:37.800> see<00:02:38.100> it's<00:02:38.760> a<00:02:38.850> lot

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
c5 50s in a bit you can see it's a lot

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.090 
c5 50s in a bit you can see it's a lot
smoother<00:02:39.330> now<00:02:40.520> it<00:02:41.520> was<00:02:41.670> really<00:02:42.240> lean<00:02:42.540> earlier

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
smoother now it was really lean earlier

00:02:43.100 --> 00:03:01.940 
smoother now it was really lean earlier
so<00:02:44.750> it<00:02:45.750> tells<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.200> lot<00:02:46.350> already<00:02:47.630> hi<00:02:48.630> ve

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.430 

so<00:03:02.370> here's<00:03:02.550> this<00:03:02.610> clean<00:03:02.880> motor

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
so here's this clean motor

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.830 
so here's this clean motor
all<00:03:05.010> of<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.280> missions<00:03:05.610> are<00:03:05.760> intact<00:03:06.060> because

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
all of the missions are intact because

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.650 
all of the missions are intact because
we<00:03:07.290> live<00:03:07.440> here<00:03:07.620> in<00:03:07.740> San<00:03:07.950> Diego<00:03:08.010> and<00:03:08.340> SoCal<00:03:08.910> it's

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
we live here in San Diego and SoCal it's

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.000 
we live here in San Diego and SoCal it's
always<00:03:09.900> good<00:03:10.050> to<00:03:10.080> be<00:03:10.200> prepared<00:03:10.350> for<00:03:10.860> the

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
so everything's there has Ross 40 over

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.899 
so everything's there has Ross 40 over

it<00:03:26.629> supported<00:03:27.170> and<00:03:27.379> built<00:03:28.030> walk<00:03:29.030> has<00:03:29.269> a<00:03:29.299> bullet

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
it supported and built walk has a bullet

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.930 
it supported and built walk has a bullet
crankshaft

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.060 

so<00:03:35.390> this<00:03:35.540> car<00:03:35.810> is<00:03:35.930> ready<00:03:36.140> to<00:03:36.260> make<00:03:36.440> a<00:03:36.470> lot<00:03:36.860> of

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
so this car is ready to make a lot of

00:03:37.070 --> 00:04:01.210 
so this car is ready to make a lot of
power

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.250 

remember<00:04:02.220> Georgia's<00:04:02.580> vr4<00:04:03.030> already<00:04:03.810> done<00:04:04.080> in

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
remember Georgia's vr4 already done in

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:17.530 
remember Georgia's vr4 already done in
true

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:24.230 

go<00:04:18.540> back<00:04:18.720> to<00:04:18.810> the<00:04:18.930> side<00:04:19.170> so<00:04:19.380> I<00:04:19.440> don't<00:04:23.000> so<00:04:24.000> game

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
go back to the side so I don't so game

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.820 
go back to the side so I don't so game

the<00:04:28.860> am<00:04:29.280> true<00:04:29.520> boost<00:04:29.700> so<00:04:30.210> that<00:04:30.680> it's<00:04:31.680> working

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
the am true boost so that it's working

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.930

properly<00:04:33.920> up<00:04:34.920> them<00:04:35.100> in<00:04:35.220> those<00:04:35.370> two<00:04:35.550> so<00:04:35.760> I<00:04:35.790> don't

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
properly up them in those two so I don't

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.610 
properly up them in those two so I don't
look<00:04:36.000> awkward<00:04:37.220> rated<00:04:38.220> that<00:04:38.400> game<00:04:39.180> plan<00:04:39.420> is<00:04:39.840> our

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
look awkward rated that game plan is our

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.040 
look awkward rated that game plan is our
c5<00:04:41.040> 50s<00:04:41.430> bump<00:04:41.760> up<00:04:41.970> base<00:04:42.180> fuel<00:04:42.450> pressure<00:04:42.690> which

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
c5 50s bump up base fuel pressure which

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.080 
c5 50s bump up base fuel pressure which
it<00:04:43.650> seems<00:04:43.950> like<00:04:44.100> that's<00:04:44.220> already<00:04:44.520> done

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
it seems like that's already done

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.460 
it seems like that's already done
I'll<00:04:45.330> just<00:04:45.690> confirm<00:04:46.440> that<00:04:46.620> to<00:04:46.890> be<00:04:47.010> sure<00:04:48.470> the

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
I'll just confirm that to be sure the

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.370 
I'll just confirm that to be sure the
crank<00:04:49.770> vents<00:04:50.160> for<00:04:50.850> high<00:04:51.000> boost<00:04:51.300> you<00:04:52.200> can

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
crank vents for high boost you can

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.800 
crank vents for high boost you can
always<00:04:52.940> you<00:04:53.940> can<00:04:54.090> never<00:04:54.240> go<00:04:54.420> wrong<00:04:54.450> with<00:04:54.630> that

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
always you can never go wrong with that

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.040 
always you can never go wrong with that
and<00:04:54.960> always<00:04:55.320> go<00:04:55.410> right<00:04:55.620> with<00:04:55.830> it<00:04:56.930> protect<00:04:57.930> your

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
and always go right with it protect your

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:04.160 
and always go right with it protect your
motor<00:04:58.230> and<00:05:00.770> the<00:05:01.770> correct<00:05:02.070> spark<00:05:02.400> plugs<00:05:03.170> called

our heat range

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.120 
our heat range
hopefully<00:05:06.300> it's<00:05:07.200> probably<00:05:07.590> gonna<00:05:07.680> be<00:05:07.860> closer

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
hopefully it's probably gonna be closer

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.840 
hopefully it's probably gonna be closer
to<00:05:08.400> a<00:05:08.600> 1617<00:05:09.600> psi<00:05:10.320> tune<00:05:10.530> just<00:05:11.490> because<00:05:11.820> I

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
to a 1617 psi tune just because I

to a 1617 psi tune just because I
anticipate<00:05:12.660> this<00:05:13.130> motor<00:05:14.130> just<00:05:14.520> really<00:05:14.910> a

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
anticipate this motor just really a

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
breathing it breathing very well flowing

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.320 
breathing it breathing very well flowing
well<00:05:18.270> I'm<00:05:19.200> gonna<00:05:19.430> swallow<00:05:20.430> all<00:05:20.610> this<00:05:20.640> fuel<00:05:21.060> and

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
well I'm gonna swallow all this fuel and

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.520 
well I'm gonna swallow all this fuel and
chug<00:05:22.110> it<00:05:22.140> down<00:05:23.120> so<00:05:24.120> we'll<00:05:24.870> see<00:05:25.020> what<00:05:25.170> happens

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
chug it down so we'll see what happens

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:26.570 
chug it down so we'll see what happens
it's<00:05:25.710> gonna<00:05:25.830> make<00:05:26.040> a<00:05:26.070> lot<00:05:26.250> of<00:05:26.280> power

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
it's gonna make a lot of power

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.200 
it's gonna make a lot of power
especially<00:05:28.400> now<00:05:29.400> that<00:05:29.430> it's<00:05:29.700> here<00:05:29.850> with<00:05:30.000> me

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
especially now that it's here with me

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:35.570 
especially now that it's here with me
and<00:05:31.460> all<00:05:32.460> I<00:05:32.520> can<00:05:32.670> say<00:05:32.970> is<00:05:33.120> stay<00:05:33.330> tuned
