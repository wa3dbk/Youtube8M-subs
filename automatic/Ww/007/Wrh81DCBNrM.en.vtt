00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:20.989
 Welcome 

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:23.510
 but much depends on the lessons 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.900
 children's fund party girl herself 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.160
 data will be at the end of March so want 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.390
 become when it comes out very interesting 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.620
 I respect you 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.680
 only promise 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.579
 August 10, 2011 they are wrong promised them 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:44.239
 I consider that 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.840
 space house 1 and work on 1 5 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.330
 Wonderful fantasy station 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.530
 I was afraid that you would not like that you did not 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.840
 itâ€™s just as beautiful 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.380
 who can you already know what 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.370
 I remember static 50 years old Moscow 11 sep bart 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.740
 Of course not 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.759
 I want to rely on space 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:10.619
 candidate 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.680
 that is, there is nothing easier 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.540
 cooked 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.230
 key to start 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.230
 go 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.580
 years five points per match mayor 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.430
 What is the point 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.910
 at the very real station are good 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.780
 fantasy and because as with the roof but why 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:35.860
 one 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.670
 in spacesuits they are simply unnecessary to us and 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.900
 imperfections produced 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:41.710
 art 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:42.560
 Vladivostok 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.650
 why suddenly appeared 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.940
 According to experts, the reason is Moscow in the region 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.590
 the heroine is because the girl herself 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.490
 that we are in zero gravity for this 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.220
 here in space 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.420
 make earth pull 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.560
 so we can freely philip iv 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.870
 quarter ahead 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.820
 there probably 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.040
 head of tmr 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.329
 control 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.269
 space station first added 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:11.479
 mayor 

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:13.609
 an obstacle for people suffering 

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:14.349
 cancer 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:15.809
 December 10th 

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:18.809
 well ns laid equipment for 

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:22.149
 changed my mind it was not difficult but 

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:24.899
 if in confidence I have not yet invented what 

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:27.719
 all these buttons and levers if you want 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:30.669
 work at which station there is not enough 

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:31.639
 more than 5 years 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:35.159
 regarding need to know the purpose of each 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:37.489
 Philip Mora da Dagestan 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.129
 sure to know when for example 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:41.689
 power management 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:45.239
 time with guns well, why cannons someone 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.859
 attack the station but that the new year of the Rosh 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:51.349

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.260
 what they said we shot what was happening 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.449
 on the screen 

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:57.959
 u system 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.979
 lord tons 

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:03.059
 at the end of the action distributed guessed 

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:04.400
 where are you just 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.899
 opel astra 

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:09.429
 space gamma will be when you grow up 

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:11.310
 a space flight 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.589
 what can pull 

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:15.979
 interesting to watch cartoons 

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:19.159
 space flight one more nursery 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:20.569
 fantasy 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.579
 as I specially prepared however on 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:24.879
 this level 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:26.350
 have these interests 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.350
 let's take a closer look at 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.469
 Besides 

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:34.269
 he 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.059
 then there is a chance at the station will be very 

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:40.059
 uneasy 

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:43.009
 323 people 

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:44.569
 attacker ton 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.699
 no then no one will say up to 40 thousand 

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:50.749
 if i don't know 

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:52.949
 in Moscow 

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:55.059
 there is nothing special 

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:57.199
 duel france 0 

00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:00.739
 more precisely chocolate built on 1 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.849
 this year in life 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:05.829
 later this difference in the score 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:09.339
 pages should deal with it for now 

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:12.339
 yes and rates 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:17.590
 fun to do what I know we are 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.900
 today I must personally no longer look like 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.330
 promised but if she was the main 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.330
 there is another key theme ahead 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.889
 this is the priority of fantasy and this 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:33.629
 things are very similar 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:35.860
 we still have to wait a long time before we 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.810
 together we can not fly into space 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:39.439
 trouble 

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:42.849
 showing patience and perseverance and how 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:46.279
 set goals fulfilling the dream 

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:49.130
 candidate all must 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.530
 will turn out 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.669
 father of dogs 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:55.050
 did you guys understand 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.979
 but 23 children only hope that our 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:00.880
 questions approached the release of q 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.020
 barely American for myself and not for show 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:04.949
 these friends
