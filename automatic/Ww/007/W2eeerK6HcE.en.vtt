00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
subtle difference between creating a new

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.979 
subtle difference between creating a new

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
event which asks for a specific time

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.199 
event which asks for a specific time
whereas<00:03:11.989> creating<00:03:12.890> a<00:03:12.950> new<00:03:13.129> task<00:03:13.370> doesn't<00:03:13.879> ask

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
whereas creating a new task doesn't ask

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.110 
whereas creating a new task doesn't ask
for<00:03:14.450> a<00:03:14.480> specific<00:03:14.629> time
