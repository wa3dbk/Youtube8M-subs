00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:16.090
 It was the advertising, so to speak, that again 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.439
 flight takes place and here you want the 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.720
 learning behavior and that pushes me 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:23.470
 surely they are making live performances 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.470
 the league with 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.239
 We are working since the end of June at the beginning of July 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.510
 and the first steps were 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:52.350
 actually with the hull then with with 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.739
 the wing so with a length of 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.379
 six meters wingspan of with 18 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.199
 Meters allowed me to stay what it still is 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.940
 Not 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.009
 yes I still want the formal act 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.720
 go around so I always know 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:11.160
 what that is like of the 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.369
 run down preparations 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.720
 already since two days but 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.930
 in principle, so slowly when you start 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.530
 then full of motivation and I hope 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.530
 me a good place 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:00.290
 the weather played along were the apprentices 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.790
 just perfect as always am surprised 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.100
 the apprentices have to learn about the performance 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.950
 have really brought together perfectly 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.899
 made as soon as you see the water 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.660
 then you have the place in berlin 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.860
 but more it was funny it was funny 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.980
 not so bad 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.400
 So had guys around her fun and 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.400
 again next time
