00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
is difficult but I totally have a scene

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.520 
is difficult but I totally have a scene
where<00:00:51.489> Dean<00:00:52.489> takes<00:00:52.760> a<00:00:52.880> walk<00:00:53.030> on<00:00:53.239> the<00:00:53.300> beach

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
yeah it's he doesn't enjoy it because he

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.400 
yeah it's he doesn't enjoy it because he
doesn't<00:00:58.879> have<00:00:59.150> that<00:00:59.270> kind<00:00:59.480> of<00:00:59.570> life<00:00:59.809> but<00:01:00.140> like

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
doesn't have that kind of life but like

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.229 
doesn't have that kind of life but like
the<00:01:00.680> idea<00:01:01.010> of<00:01:01.100> Dean<00:01:01.370> actually<00:01:01.790> even<00:01:01.970> having<00:01:02.180> a

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
the idea of Dean actually even having a

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.840 
the idea of Dean actually even having a
moment<00:01:02.450> of<00:01:02.660> each<00:01:02.989> is<00:01:03.860> sort<00:01:04.100> of<00:01:04.160> in<00:01:04.580> a<00:01:04.640> way

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
moment of each is sort of in a way

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.109 
moment of each is sort of in a way
quietly<00:01:05.270> evolutionary<00:01:06.050> advantage<00:01:06.590> yeah<00:01:07.119> but

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
quietly evolutionary advantage yeah but

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.760 
quietly evolutionary advantage yeah but
