happens<00:00:11.849> in<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:12.059> hard<00:00:12.240> drive<00:00:12.480> when<00:00:12.750> you<00:00:12.840> start

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
happens in a hard drive when you start

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.310 
happens in a hard drive when you start
your<00:00:13.200> computer<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:14.030> play<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.389> read<00:00:16.170> and

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
your computer and play and read and

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.080 
your computer and play and read and
write<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.500> disk<00:00:18.140> hi<00:00:19.140> what<00:00:19.500> we<00:00:19.619> have<00:00:19.830> here<00:00:20.279> is<00:00:20.310> a

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
write a disk hi what we have here is a

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.450 
write a disk hi what we have here is a
computer<00:00:21.480> system<00:00:22.109> with<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.680> side<00:00:22.890> cover<00:00:23.250> off

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
computer system with the side cover off

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.150 
computer system with the side cover off
so<00:00:23.670> that<00:00:23.699> we<00:00:23.880> can<00:00:24.029> see<00:00:24.210> insight<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.859> pulled

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
so that we can see insight and I pulled

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.330 
so that we can see insight and I pulled
the<00:00:26.340> hard<00:00:26.580> drive<00:00:26.970> out<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.990> its<00:00:28.170> Bay<00:00:28.439> so<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.250> we

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
the hard drive out of its Bay so that we

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.769 
the hard drive out of its Bay so that we
can<00:00:29.460> look<00:00:29.640> at<00:00:29.789> it<00:00:29.849> further<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.210> then<00:00:30.420> remove

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
can look at it further and then remove

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.110 
can look at it further and then remove
the<00:00:30.840> cover<00:00:31.349> from<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.830> hard<00:00:32.040> drive<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:33.000> we

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
the cover from the hard drive so that we

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.850 
the cover from the hard drive so that we
can<00:00:33.239> see<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.660> platters<00:00:34.170> where<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.530> actual

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
can see the platters where the actual

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.880 
can see the platters where the actual
data<00:00:35.160> is<00:00:35.430> read<00:00:35.940> written<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.079> platters

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
data is read written to the platters

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.860 
data is read written to the platters
this<00:00:38.460> particular<00:00:38.790> hard<00:00:39.149> drive<00:00:39.329> has<00:00:39.600> two

this particular hard drive has two
platters<00:00:40.170> on<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:41.370> there's<00:00:41.850> going<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.120> have

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
platters on it so there's going to have

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.830 
platters on it so there's going to have
to<00:00:42.270> be<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.809> read/write<00:00:43.739> head<00:00:43.950> for<00:00:44.190> each<00:00:44.309> platter

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
to be a read/write head for each platter

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.389 
to be a read/write head for each platter

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
the operating systems is stored and then

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.560 
the operating systems is stored and then
there's<00:01:11.580> also<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.970> drive<00:01:12.330> d<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.290> dr<00:01:13.590> e<00:01:14.570> draw

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
inside they just move to the track and

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.200 
inside they just move to the track and
then<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.540> sector<00:02:04.050> comes<00:02:04.410> under<00:02:04.830> them<00:02:05.210> we're

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
then the sector comes under them we're

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.270 
then the sector comes under them we're
going<00:02:06.300> to<00:02:06.360> demonstrate<00:02:06.710> making<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.770> copy<00:02:08.039> of

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
going to demonstrate making a copy of

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.060 
going to demonstrate making a copy of
several<00:02:08.880> files<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:09.780> are<00:02:09.929> stored<00:02:09.959> on<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.860> dry

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
several files that are stored on the dry

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.710 
several files that are stored on the dry
sea<00:02:11.400> partition<00:02:12.170> over<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:14.010> dr<00:02:14.340> e<00:02:14.720> partition

sea partition over to the dr e partition

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.960 
sea partition over to the dr e partition
and<00:02:15.840> we'll<00:02:16.080> see<00:02:16.320> that<00:02:16.560> they're<00:02:17.310> copied<00:02:17.730> one

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
and we'll see that they're copied one

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.180 
and we'll see that they're copied one
file<00:02:18.180> at<00:02:18.209> a<00:02:18.450> time<00:02:18.510> not<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.290> whole<00:02:19.590> chunk<00:02:19.890> and

file at a time not a whole chunk and

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.880 
file at a time not a whole chunk and
then<00:02:20.340> drop<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.880> whole<00:02:21.060> chunk<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:21.620> since<00:02:22.620> the

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
then drop the whole chunk and since the

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.650 
then drop the whole chunk and since the
computer<00:02:23.459> is<00:02:23.550> off<00:02:23.760> we<00:02:24.120> might<00:02:24.330> as<00:02:24.420> well<00:02:24.480> just

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
computer is off we might as well just

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.440 
computer is off we might as well just
watch<00:02:25.080> as<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:26.310> know<00:02:26.400> what<00:02:26.550> happens<00:02:26.940> when<00:02:27.060> the
