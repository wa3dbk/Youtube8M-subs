00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.350
 hi girls then we hope that 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.570
 the lighting is decent in this 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.580
 video was not sure however today vi 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.170
 I show all the products I have 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.000
 finished in the last period up 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.490
 at the last drop and let you know 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.980
 what I think the finished product is 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.320
 cream in the spot and eye contour of the 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.150
 benefit then this cream is one of the 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.310
 few products of this line 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.439
 of the benefit that I liked because 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.930
 the scent is not as strong as i 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:38.559
 indeed other products is very pleasant and 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.910
 it also acts as a make-up base because yes 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.149
 it absorbs very quickly then after 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.800
 five minutes I can already pass 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:45.730
 the concealer I'm not used to 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.499
 talk to the past 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.289
 another finished product and make-up remover 

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:52.629
 biphasic chanel eyes that is made though 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:55.030
 that sensitive and this is one of the few 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.920
 make-up removers that are really suitable 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.600
 to sensitive eyes because it does not burn 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.239
 even serious ends up in the eyes 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.399
 quiet it always happens to me not 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.920
 burns done and then something I like 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.960
 of this makeup remover and that takes away the 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.520
 makeup very effectively with really 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.229
 with a two-pass 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.909
 the trick is completely gone is 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.350
 this does not happen with all 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.509
 tools we tried I tried 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.670
 many but I must say that this is one 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.219
 of the best is the price is quite 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.369
 however high it is not of those products 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:26.920
 that cost a lot and then at the end 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:30.130
 worth at least this is at least a 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.170
 emphasis however is none of good quality 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.570
 nor just very little for 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.119
 remove make-up from the eyes and then in short ve 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.579
 I recommend it then I finished the drops 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.590
 anchovies done s I'm sure that everything 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:43.060
 by now he knows them elected but if you are among 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.399
 the few that run know them 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.109
 they are practically voices in it 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.299
 apply on the enamel when still 

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:51.219
 fresh and make it swing very much 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.659
 in a hurry it's these I can't 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:54.579
 absolutely do without yesterday 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.560
 I would definitely buy yes because not 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:58.689
 like already another three or four bottles of 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.909
 products I can never be without 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:03.490
 when he finds stress, I stock up 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.679
 because then if I come back and don't find them I go 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.260
 then I ended this figure 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:09.630
 of the gima to come out 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.070
 see here it is the empty packaging 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.410
 I really enjoyed this cycle 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.560
 both because it is very clear then 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.720
 perfect for ghosts like me either 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.940
 bacchetti in the skin 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.250
 matt skin until evening is the one who has the skin 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.080
 mixed knows that it does not always happen with 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.240
 all the figures so in short, when 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.550
 I find a buna I am particularly 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:33.060
 satisfied with other finished product is 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.220
 the lush delight balm of this makes me 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.910
 go crazy scent because it really knows 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:43.560
 of dolcetto that something phenomenal 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:45.900
 I remember the macarons though this balm 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.330
 the hair is very dry and dull 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.640
 definitely moisturizing but I don't have it 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.380
 found quite moisturizing for my parents 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.510
 hair that these too are challenged 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.210
 unfortunately and they are very dry then 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.220
 they need to like me for that extra 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.990
 of hydration that this is enough 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.120
 I have not sent despite being a very good one 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.040
 balsam but I would recommend it to those who have i 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.380
 normal hair and does not know that hair 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.940
 super super super dry one thing that 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.730
 instead I would recommend to those with hair 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.950
 super super super super dry and this one 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.870
 sansone hair mask of this 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.680
 they talked to me about it after a use me 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.100
 it seems 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.360
 and now that I've arrived at the end of 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.390
 product I must say that my idea is 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.640
 remained the same because it is excellent and that is 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.530
 the tics of the mirrors manages to 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.019
 soften them immediately, today I have it 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.959
 left up for three quarters of an hour ignored 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:36.120
 20 and when I welcome him I immediately feel the 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.489
 many hair softer and much more 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.880
 disciplined are much simpler and 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:44.610
 much simpler Pettinari is short 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.900
 I find it really fantastic I don't know if 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.360
 I never found a mask that 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.400
 worked so well on my type of 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.560
 hair so in short this is super 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.580
 recommended and no guys this for 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.440
 today is everything 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.430
 I hope you enjoyed the video there 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.129
 I send a huge kiss 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.079
 let's see my next video 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:04.849
 sunglasses that I think you already have 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:06.290
 seen in the last hubs never beautiful but not 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:07.430
 I'm sure they have these 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.439
 white bows that make me 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.980
 going crazy as you know I 'm staring 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:13.030
 for the streams 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.030
 and here they are
