said before I don't promote any certain

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.779 
said before I don't promote any certain
persons<00:04:45.590> equipment<00:04:46.590> but<00:04:47.100> this<00:04:47.280> stuff<00:04:47.490> seems

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:47.789 
persons equipment but this stuff seems

00:04:47.789 --> 00:05:04.299 
persons equipment but this stuff seems
to<00:04:47.910> work<00:04:48.060> pretty<00:04:48.090> good<00:04:52.550> yeah<00:04:53.550> pretty<00:04:53.820> much

00:05:04.299 --> 00:05:04.309 

00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:07.850 

once<00:05:05.309> you<00:05:05.430> get<00:05:05.550> your<00:05:05.729> amount<00:05:06.029> of<00:05:06.150> water<00:05:06.589> it's<00:05:07.589> a

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
once you get your amount of water it's a

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.439 
once you get your amount of water it's a
pretty<00:05:08.370> darn<00:05:08.610> easy<00:05:08.819> I<00:05:10.819> think<00:05:11.819> that's<00:05:12.120> the<00:05:12.240> same

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:12.449 
pretty darn easy I think that's the same

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:15.350 
pretty darn easy I think that's the same
setup<00:05:12.809> as<00:05:13.050> he<00:05:13.199> uses<00:05:13.469> for<00:05:13.860> the<00:05:13.979> did<00:05:14.939> you<00:05:14.969> set<00:05:15.270> it

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
setup as he uses for the did you set it

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.299 
setup as he uses for the did you set it
up<00:05:15.449> just<00:05:15.479> like<00:05:15.719> the<00:05:15.839> highbanker<00:05:16.379> that<00:05:16.740> he<00:05:16.889> yeah

00:05:17.299 --> 00:05:17.309 
up just like the highbanker that he yeah

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:19.100 
up just like the highbanker that he yeah
it's<00:05:17.460> got<00:05:17.610> the<00:05:17.759> under<00:05:18.029> riffle<00:05:18.360> at<00:05:18.509> the<00:05:18.599> top<00:05:18.839> and

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
it's got the under riffle at the top and

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.709 
it's got the under riffle at the top and
then<00:05:19.199> the<00:05:19.289> scrubber<00:05:19.589> and<00:05:19.860> then<00:05:20.039> under<00:05:20.339> water

00:05:20.709 --> 00:05:20.719 
then the scrubber and then under water

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:23.360 
then the scrubber and then under water
also<00:05:21.719> you're<00:05:22.110> not<00:05:22.229> using<00:05:22.499> the<00:05:22.710> riffle<00:05:23.069> down<00:05:23.099> at

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
also you're not using the riffle down at

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.689 
also you're not using the riffle down at
the<00:05:23.490> river<00:05:24.089> down<00:05:24.960> at<00:05:25.080> the<00:05:25.139> bottom<00:05:25.370> see<00:05:26.370> I<00:05:26.400> got<00:05:26.580> I

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:26.699 
the river down at the bottom see I got I

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:30.320 
the river down at the bottom see I got I
got<00:05:26.879> a<00:05:26.909> middle<00:05:28.819> expanded<00:05:29.819> middle<00:05:30.059> there's<00:05:30.240> a

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:40.289 
yeah I think the way he sets his up is

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:43.730 
yeah I think the way he sets his up is
it's<00:05:40.499> a<00:05:41.149> you<00:05:42.149> are<00:05:42.330> and<00:05:42.719> then<00:05:43.229> scrubber
