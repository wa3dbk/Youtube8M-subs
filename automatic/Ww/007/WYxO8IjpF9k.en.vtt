a question I frequently get asked is

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.410 
a question I frequently get asked is
about<00:00:07.319> if<00:00:07.770> the<00:00:07.890> parent<00:00:08.220> comes<00:00:08.400> in<00:00:08.580> and<00:00:09.059> is

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
for a second opinion sometimes I can

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.510 
for a second opinion sometimes I can
make<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.049> diagnosis<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:16.859> I<00:00:16.920> can<00:00:17.100> say<00:00:17.279> yeah

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.340 
you know I think that's what he or she
has<00:00:19.520> sometimes<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.970> say<00:00:21.210> no<00:00:21.660> that's<00:00:21.960> really<00:00:22.230> not

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
has sometimes I say no that's really not

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.500 
has sometimes I say no that's really not
what<00:00:22.740> your<00:00:22.890> child<00:00:23.160> has<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.730> quite<00:00:24.119> frankly

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
there were times that I don't know you

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.009 
there were times that I don't know you
know<00:00:26.220> you<00:00:26.279> win<00:00:26.519> some<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:26.789> lose<00:00:27.449> some<00:00:27.480> some<00:00:27.840> get

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019

know you win some you lose some some get
rained<00:00:28.260> out<00:00:28.410> so<00:00:28.680> there<00:00:29.460> are<00:00:29.580> times<00:00:29.849> that<00:00:30.000> I

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
rained out so there are times that I

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.780 
rained out so there are times that I
really<00:00:30.510> don't<00:00:30.840> know<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.710> think<00:00:32.009> any<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.610> us

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
really don't know and I think any of us

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.250 
really don't know and I think any of us
that<00:00:32.969> are<00:00:33.059> in<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:33.270> business<00:00:33.510> in<00:00:33.870> this

that are in that business in this

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.410 
that are in that business in this
business<00:00:34.469> can<00:00:35.010> are<00:00:35.309> quite<00:00:35.610> humble<00:00:35.969> about<00:00:36.180> that

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
business can are quite humble about that

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.750 
business can are quite humble about that
we<00:00:36.989> often<00:00:37.410> need<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.620> do<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.040> follow-up<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.640> the

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
we often need to do and follow-up to the

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.650 
we often need to do and follow-up to the
child<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.420> see<00:00:39.629> what<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.500> going<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.250> evolve

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
child is to see what is going to evolve

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.779 
child is to see what is going to evolve
here's<00:00:42.660> where<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.079> becomes<00:00:43.379> important<00:00:44.070> there

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
here's where it becomes important there

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.700 
here's where it becomes important there
are<00:00:44.910> two<00:00:45.090> aspects<00:00:45.600> there's<00:00:45.899> what<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.289> do<00:00:46.500> now

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
are two aspects there's what you do now

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.619 
are two aspects there's what you do now
and<00:00:47.010> what<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.640> tell<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.000> person<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.510> be

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
and what you tell the person to be

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.350 
and what you tell the person to be
prepared<00:00:49.079> for<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.590> future<00:00:49.969> what<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.120> do

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
prepared for in the future what you do

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.410 
prepared for in the future what you do
now<00:00:51.600> interestingly<00:00:52.260> enough<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:53.640> actually

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
now interestingly enough is actually

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.410 
now interestingly enough is actually
almost<00:00:55.170> less<00:00:55.710> important<00:00:56.430> you've<00:00:57.149> got

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
almost less important you've got

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.599 
almost less important you've got
somebody<00:00:57.719> who's<00:00:58.109> got<00:00:58.379> attention<00:00:59.100> problems

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
somebody who's got attention problems

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:00.619 
somebody who's got attention problems
and<00:00:59.760> they're<00:00:59.850> volatile<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.480> they're

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
and they're volatile and they're

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.090 
and they're volatile and they're
irritable<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.230> they're<00:01:01.350> aggressive<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:01.980> so

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
irritable and they're aggressive and so

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.770 
irritable and they're aggressive and so
forth<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:02.609> on<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:02.940> end<00:01:03.390> up<00:01:03.570> using

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
forth and so on and you end up using

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.260 
forth and so on and you end up using
almost<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.680> same<00:01:04.949> medications<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.850> do<00:01:06.030> if

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
almost the same medications you do if

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.320 
almost the same medications you do if
it's<00:01:06.420> ADHD<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.350> mood<00:01:07.619> problems<00:01:07.920> as<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.340> do<00:01:09.060> if

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
it's ADHD and mood problems as you do if

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.080 
it's ADHD and mood problems as you do if
they<00:01:09.600> have<00:01:09.810> bipolar<00:01:10.500> disorder<00:01:11.090> the

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
they have bipolar disorder the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.120 
they have bipolar disorder the
difference<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.470> if<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.740> think<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
difference is that if you think the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.399 
difference is that if you think the
child<00:01:14.369> has<00:01:14.610> bipolar<00:01:15.060> disorder<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.720> don't<00:01:16.080> use

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
child has bipolar disorder you don't use

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.679 
child has bipolar disorder you don't use
a<00:01:16.650> stimulant<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.460> that's<00:01:17.729> very<00:01:18.060> important

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
a stimulant and that's very important

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.810 
a stimulant and that's very important
and<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.439> other<00:01:19.650> thing<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.460> tell<00:01:20.670> the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
and the other thing is is you tell the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.179 
and the other thing is is you tell the
family<00:01:21.060> oh<00:01:21.390> my<00:01:21.869> god<00:01:22.049> your<00:01:22.470> child<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.890> gonna<00:01:23.040> be
