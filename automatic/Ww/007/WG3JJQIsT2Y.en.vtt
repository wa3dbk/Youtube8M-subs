00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
changed now so don't necessarily get all

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.219 
changed now so don't necessarily get all
like<00:00:56.729> 90<00:00:57.120> rated<00:00:57.390> players<00:00:57.569> it's<00:00:57.780> pretty<00:00:58.050> cool

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:58.229 
like 90 rated players it's pretty cool

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:59.899 
like 90 rated players it's pretty cool
and<00:00:58.589> it<00:00:58.800> should<00:00:58.949> use<00:00:59.069> some<00:00:59.190> low<00:00:59.370> rated<00:00:59.699> player

00:00:59.899 --> 00:00:59.909 
and it should use some low rated player

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:02.180 
and it should use some low rated player
