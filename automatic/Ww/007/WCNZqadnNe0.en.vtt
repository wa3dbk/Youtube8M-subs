so<00:03:25.549> this<00:03:25.730> is<00:03:25.939> the<00:03:26.599> tree<00:03:26.780> hub<00:03:26.930> guard

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
so this is the tree hub guard

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.459 
so this is the tree hub guard
this<00:03:28.189> is<00:03:28.310> unit<00:03:28.549> this<00:03:28.700> is<00:03:28.760> a<00:03:28.939> modular<00:03:29.469> so

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:30.469 
this is unit this is a modular so

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:31.959 
this is unit this is a modular so
there's<00:03:30.680> a<00:03:30.739> washer<00:03:31.099> that<00:03:31.219> goes<00:03:31.370> in<00:03:31.519> here<00:03:31.760> this

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:31.969 
there's a washer that goes in here this

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:34.000 
there's a washer that goes in here this
will<00:03:32.180> make<00:03:32.329> it<00:03:32.540> Universal<00:03:33.109> and<00:03:33.590> then<00:03:33.829> you<00:03:33.890> can

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
will make it Universal and then you can

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.809 
will make it Universal and then you can
replace<00:03:34.280> this<00:03:34.459> washer

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
replace this washer

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.259 
replace this washer
with<00:03:37.209> this<00:03:37.420> one<00:03:37.689> and<00:03:38.519> put<00:03:39.519> this<00:03:39.610> on<00:03:39.760> a<00:03:39.790> tree<00:03:40.060> hub

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
with this one and put this on a tree hub

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.330 
with this one and put this on a tree hub
and<00:03:40.599> it<00:03:41.140> won't<00:03:41.349> split<00:03:41.650> your<00:03:41.739> dropouts

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
and it won't split your dropouts

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.319 
and it won't split your dropouts
so<00:03:43.090> as<00:03:43.810> time<00:03:43.989> goes<00:03:44.170> by<00:03:44.200> bulimic<00:03:44.650> more<00:03:45.329> washers

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
so as time goes by bulimic more washers

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:48.720 
so as time goes by bulimic more washers
that<00:03:46.689> convert<00:03:47.230> to<00:03:47.379> a<00:03:47.409> profile<00:03:48.069> hub<00:03:48.250> or<00:03:48.549> other

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
that convert to a profile hub or other

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.640 
that convert to a profile hub or other
brands<00:03:49.299> so<00:03:49.480> that's<00:03:49.659> works<00:03:50.290> with<00:03:50.439> all<00:03:50.530> the
