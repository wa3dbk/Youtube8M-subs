falling<00:03:05.540> rocks<00:03:05.810> my<00:03:06.350> trick<00:03:06.650> is<00:03:06.680> to<00:03:06.920> pause<00:03:07.130> the

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
falling rocks my trick is to pause the

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.340 
falling rocks my trick is to pause the
game<00:03:07.400> and<00:03:07.610> then<00:03:07.970> react<00:03:08.330> it's<00:03:08.810> technically

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
game and then react it's technically

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.260 
game and then react it's technically
cheating<00:03:09.830> but<00:03:10.220> it's<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:10.520> way<00:03:10.700> to<00:03:10.730> get<00:03:11.030> through

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
cheating but it's the way to get through

these<00:03:11.420> kind<00:03:11.660> of<00:03:11.720> games<00:03:11.990> I<00:03:12.320> think<00:03:12.800> the<00:03:13.190> reason

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
these kind of games I think the reason

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.370 
these kind of games I think the reason
it's<00:03:13.700> tough<00:03:13.910> to<00:03:14.090> react<00:03:14.360> to<00:03:14.600> things<00:03:14.780> is<00:03:15.050> because

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
it's tough to react to things is because

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.410 
it's tough to react to things is because
the<00:03:15.530> sprites<00:03:15.830> are<00:03:15.980> so<00:03:16.190> big<00:03:16.430> you<00:03:16.640> can't<00:03:17.180> fit

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.530 
smoother than Joe and Mac which I like
another<00:06:06.190> big<00:06:06.490> difference<00:06:06.669> is<00:06:07.030> in<00:06:07.180> the<00:06:07.300> health

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:07.540 
another big difference is in the health

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.630 
another big difference is in the health
in<00:06:07.810> Joe<00:06:08.380> and<00:06:08.410> Mac<00:06:08.680> you<00:06:08.800> add<00:06:08.890> a<00:06:08.919> health<00:06:09.190> bar<00:06:09.400> in

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:09.640 
in Joe and Mac you add a health bar in

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.490 
in Joe and Mac you add a health bar in
this<00:06:09.880> you<00:06:10.090> only<00:06:10.210> get<00:06:10.480> hit<00:06:10.660> a<00:06:10.690> few<00:06:10.990> times<00:06:11.020> and

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
this you only get hit a few times and

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.770 
this you only get hit a few times and
turn<00:06:11.650> into<00:06:11.860> a<00:06:11.980> monkey<00:06:12.310> and<00:06:12.700> then<00:06:13.270> you're<00:06:13.540> dead

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:13.780 
turn into a monkey and then you're dead

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:18.000 
turn into a monkey and then you're dead
meat<00:06:15.630> also<00:06:16.630> it's<00:06:16.780> simpler<00:06:17.290> and<00:06:17.320> easier<00:06:17.830> than

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.010 
meat also it's simpler and easier than

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.219 
meat also it's simpler and easier than
Joe<00:06:18.250> and<00:06:18.430> Mac<00:06:18.580> clearly<00:06:19.270> targeted<00:06:19.810> for<00:06:20.020> younger

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:20.229 
Joe and Mac clearly targeted for younger

was never big on this but if Joe and Mac
-<00:06:53.770> is<00:06:53.979> better<00:06:54.250> than<00:06:54.520> the<00:06:54.640> first<00:06:54.850> one<00:06:55.090> like<00:06:55.240> I've

00:06:55.469 --> 00:06:55.479 
- is better than the first one like I've

00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:58.469 
- is better than the first one like I've
said<00:06:55.720> why<00:06:56.290> am<00:06:56.470> I<00:06:56.620> not<00:06:56.800> so<00:06:57.070> crazy<00:06:57.340> about<00:06:57.550> it<00:06:58.000> well

00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:58.479 
said why am I not so crazy about it well

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:00.540 
said why am I not so crazy about it well
because<00:06:59.020> it's<00:06:59.229> more<00:06:59.500> rare<00:06:59.830> and<00:06:59.860> hard<00:07:00.250> to<00:07:00.400> get

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:00.550 
because it's more rare and hard to get

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.730 
because it's more rare and hard to get
than<00:07:00.790> the<00:07:00.880> first<00:07:01.120> one<00:07:01.360> and<00:07:01.510> I<00:07:01.900> always<00:07:02.110> question

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:02.740 
than the first one and I always question

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.500 
than the first one and I always question
is<00:07:02.919> it<00:07:03.100> work<00:07:03.280> the<00:07:03.490> price<00:07:03.700> just<00:07:04.060> to<00:07:04.240> get<00:07:04.360> the

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:04.510 
is it work the price just to get the

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:07.260 
is it work the price just to get the
cartridge<00:07:05.100> thus<00:07:06.100> I've<00:07:06.370> only<00:07:06.610> played<00:07:06.970> it<00:07:07.120> over

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:07.270 
cartridge thus I've only played it over

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.630 
cartridge thus I've only played it over
emulators<00:07:08.020> so<00:07:08.200> my<00:07:08.349> information<00:07:09.010> only<00:07:09.370> comes

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:09.640 
emulators so my information only comes

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.610
