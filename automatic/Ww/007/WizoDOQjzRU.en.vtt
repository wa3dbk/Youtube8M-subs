00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.960 
up to a up to certain up to a certain
level<00:02:22.620> so<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:22.950> can't<00:02:23.220> play<00:02:23.370> all<00:02:23.640> of<00:02:23.670> the

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
level so you can't play all of the

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.530 
level so you can't play all of the
entire<00:02:24.930> campaign<00:02:25.410> mode<00:02:25.680> but<00:02:26.459> you<00:02:26.760> can<00:02:27.150> play<00:02:27.390> it

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
entire campaign mode but you can play it

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
up to a certain level which is I think

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.930 
up to a certain level which is I think
it's<00:02:29.970> I<00:02:30.209> actually<00:02:30.390> did<00:02:30.870> that<00:02:31.049> and<00:02:31.260> I<00:02:31.319> finished

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
it's I actually did that and I finished

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.430 
it's I actually did that and I finished
playing<00:02:32.940> up<00:02:33.269> to<00:02:33.299> whatever<00:02:33.750> they<00:02:33.989> allowed<00:02:34.230> me

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
to do and it's a it's a fair amount of

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.420 
to do and it's a it's a fair amount of
content<00:02:38.430> for<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.970> free-to-play<00:02:39.599> user<00:02:39.989> but

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.420 
free-to-play aspect of it which is
really<00:03:09.599> interesting<00:03:09.810> because<00:03:10.379> that's<00:03:11.069> one

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
really interesting because that's one

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.890 
really interesting because that's one
restriction<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.209> other<00:03:12.329> restriction

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
that I found was you can't create a Kara

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.680 
that I found was you can't create a Kara
well<00:03:17.250> you<00:03:17.340> know<00:03:17.489> you<00:03:17.730> can<00:03:17.970> yes<00:03:18.239> you<00:03:18.269> can<00:03:18.420> also

the<00:03:25.350> one<00:03:25.769> other<00:03:25.920> aspect<00:03:26.100> that<00:03:26.489> is<00:03:26.700> restricted

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
the one other aspect that is restricted

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.420 
the one other aspect that is restricted
I<00:03:27.450> believe<00:03:28.170> I'm<00:03:28.440> pretty<00:03:28.680> sure<00:03:28.950> this<00:03:29.130> is<00:03:29.190> said

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
I believe I'm pretty sure this is said

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.030 
I believe I'm pretty sure this is said
because<00:03:29.549> I<00:03:30.030> tried<00:03:30.780> to<00:03:31.079> join<00:03:31.319> different<00:03:31.799> types

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
because I tried to join different types

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.699 
because I tried to join different types
of<00:03:32.280> games<00:03:32.519> and<00:03:32.760> different<00:03:32.880> maps<00:03:33.470> it<00:03:34.470> wouldn't

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
of games and different maps it wouldn't

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.890 
of games and different maps it wouldn't
let<00:03:34.829> me<00:03:35.010> so<00:03:35.250> there<00:03:35.519> is<00:03:35.700> only<00:03:35.910> a<00:03:36.060> couple<00:03:36.359> of<00:03:36.630> maps

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
let me so there is only a couple of maps

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.250 
let me so there is only a couple of maps
for<00:03:37.290> multiplayer<00:03:38.180> available<00:03:39.180> for<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.079> free

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.220 
for multiplayer available for the free
to<00:03:40.380> play<00:03:40.410> person<00:03:40.980> I<00:03:41.849> think<00:03:42.450> it's<00:03:42.599> Lost<00:03:42.930> Temple

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
to play person I think it's Lost Temple

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.650 
to play person I think it's Lost Temple
and<00:03:43.680> something<00:03:44.160> else<00:03:44.340> correct<00:03:45.269> me<00:03:45.480> if<00:03:45.540> I'm

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
and something else correct me if I'm

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.720 
and something else correct me if I'm
wrong<00:03:45.690> in<00:03:46.109> the<00:03:46.200> comments<00:03:46.410> there<00:03:46.769> there's<00:03:47.489> only

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
wrong in the comments there there's only

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.449 
wrong in the comments there there's only
a<00:03:47.819> couple<00:03:47.880> or<00:03:48.239> a<00:03:48.269> few<00:03:48.630> maps<00:03:49.380> available<00:03:49.620> to<00:03:50.190> play

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
a couple or a few maps available to play

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.360 
a couple or a few maps available to play
and<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:51.359> other<00:03:51.540> aspect<00:03:52.109> is<00:03:52.260> I<00:03:52.500> believe<00:03:53.099> you

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
and the other aspect is I believe you

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.589 
and the other aspect is I believe you
can't<00:03:54.680> do<00:03:55.680> some<00:03:55.919> different<00:03:56.310> game<00:03:56.519> modes<00:03:56.790> so

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
can't do some different game modes so

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.470 
can't do some different game modes so
this<00:03:57.870> one<00:03:58.109> you're<00:03:58.290> seeing<00:03:58.590> right<00:03:58.950> now<00:03:58.980> is<00:03:59.480> two

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
this one you're seeing right now is two

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.140 
this one you're seeing right now is two
V<00:04:00.720> tubes<00:04:01.019> and<00:04:01.380> I<00:04:02.069> am<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:03.389> light<00:04:04.079> blue<00:04:04.500> colored

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
V tubes and I am the light blue colored

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.250 
V tubes and I am the light blue colored
Terran<00:04:06.150> on<00:04:06.269> the<00:04:06.389> left<00:04:06.569> hand<00:04:06.780> side<00:04:06.989> they're

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
Terran on the left hand side they're

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.059 
Terran on the left hand side they're
making<00:04:07.650> my<00:04:07.769> barracks<00:04:08.160> and<00:04:09.440> other<00:04:10.440> than<00:04:10.739> that

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
making my barracks and other than that

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.520 
making my barracks and other than that
really<00:04:11.609> there's<00:04:11.940> not<00:04:12.359> any<00:04:12.690> more<00:04:12.959> restrictions

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
really there's not any more restrictions

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.199 
really there's not any more restrictions
but<00:04:13.680> these<00:04:14.130> restrictions<00:04:14.609> are<00:04:14.940> really

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
but these restrictions are really

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.300 
but these restrictions are really
crucial<00:04:15.450> so<00:04:15.870> they<00:04:16.320> kind<00:04:16.650> of<00:04:16.739> hinder<00:04:16.979> the<00:04:17.099> game

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
crucial so they kind of hinder the game

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.370 
crucial so they kind of hinder the game

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 
now going after the Nexus my other team

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.420 
now going after the Nexus my other team
is<00:06:45.120> okay<00:06:45.750> I<00:06:45.780> think<00:06:45.990> he<00:06:46.380> was<00:06:46.530> actually<00:06:46.770> a<00:06:47.040> kind

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:47.430 
is okay I think he was actually a kind

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.030 
is okay I think he was actually a kind
of<00:06:47.580> a<00:06:47.700> new<00:06:48.420> player<00:06:48.690> like<00:06:48.960> me<00:06:49.200> as<00:06:49.350> well<00:06:49.380> um

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:50.040 
of a new player like me as well um

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.190 
of a new player like me as well um
that's<00:06:51.030> why<00:06:51.180> I<00:06:51.210> think<00:06:51.330> he's<00:06:51.600> playing<00:06:51.810> Terran

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:52.200 
that's why I think he's playing Terran

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.080 
that's why I think he's playing Terran
to<00:06:52.350> I<00:06:52.380> think<00:06:52.680> he<00:06:52.770> was<00:06:52.920> a<00:06:52.950> free<00:06:53.610> to<00:06:53.700> play<00:06:53.820> player

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:54.090 
to I think he was a free to play player

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:57.410 
to I think he was a free to play player
but<00:06:54.330> the<00:06:54.480> Protoss<00:06:54.980> obviously<00:06:55.980> is<00:06:56.400> a<00:06:56.880> paying

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:57.420 
but the Protoss obviously is a paying

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.390 
but the Protoss obviously is a paying
player<00:06:57.780> so<00:06:58.020> that's<00:06:58.530> an<00:06:58.710> that's<00:06:58.860> a<00:06:59.130> direct

00:06:59.390 --> 00:06:59.400 
player so that's an that's a direct

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.760 
player so that's an that's a direct
example<00:06:59.820> of<00:07:00.180> how<00:07:00.630> free<00:07:00.990> to<00:07:01.020> play<00:07:01.290> and<00:07:01.500> pay<00:07:01.710> to

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:01.770 
example of how free to play and pay to

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.340 
example of how free to play and pay to
play<00:07:01.980> players<00:07:02.310> are<00:07:02.580> playing<00:07:03.150> the<00:07:03.330> same<00:07:03.600> realm

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:04.350 
play players are playing the same realm

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:07.640 
play players are playing the same realm
kind<00:07:04.890> of<00:07:05.040> and<00:07:05.840> here's<00:07:06.840> the<00:07:06.990> Protoss<00:07:07.410> player

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:07.650 
kind of and here's the Protoss player

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:12.200 
kind of and here's the Protoss player
coming<00:07:07.920> into<00:07:08.040> my<00:07:09.890> teammates<00:07:10.890> base<00:07:11.160> and<00:07:11.460> he's

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:12.210 
coming into my teammates base and he's

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:13.790 
coming into my teammates base and he's
gonna<00:07:12.390> actually<00:07:12.570> do<00:07:12.810> quite<00:07:13.290> a<00:07:13.320> bit<00:07:13.380> of<00:07:13.530> damage

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800 
gonna actually do quite a bit of damage

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.680 
gonna actually do quite a bit of damage
I<00:07:14.130> think<00:07:14.370> he's<00:07:14.460> gonna<00:07:14.580> click<00:07:14.940> clean<00:07:15.450> up<00:07:15.570> the

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:15.690 
I think he's gonna click clean up the

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:18.500 
I think he's gonna click clean up the
workers<00:07:16.350> from<00:07:17.340> the<00:07:17.460> Terran<00:07:17.760> side<00:07:18.000> here<00:07:18.330> and

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:18.510 
workers from the Terran side here and

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:21.050 
workers from the Terran side here and
once<00:07:19.350> I<00:07:19.500> see<00:07:19.740> that<00:07:19.920> I<00:07:19.950> sent<00:07:20.280> my<00:07:20.400> Marines<00:07:20.790> off

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:21.060 
once I see that I sent my Marines off

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:23.360 
once I see that I sent my Marines off
