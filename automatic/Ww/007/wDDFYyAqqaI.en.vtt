00:00:00.839 --> 00:00:04.819
 I welcome you to the poker school I declare today 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.049
 the world's most played poker game Texas Holdem No Limit 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:11.999
 especially for those of you who have never 

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:13.889
 or have rarely played poker before 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.169

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:18.460

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.699
 the persons asked by the casino or poker provider 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.489
 the cash register manages to keep order and gives the cards 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:32.860
 what I say is the law at the table 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.620
 Fetching something is played with a 52-sheet card game 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.040
