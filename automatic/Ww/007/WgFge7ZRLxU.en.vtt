00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello welcome to disabled 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.589
 barrier-free as we are in Austria 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.440
 at the fair in wales integra and the 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:14.309
 company sunrise medical provides this 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:18.289
 first time completely brand new back in front of the 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:24.150
 chat 3 and this time with carbon 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:26.880
 tomorrow a really chic and back 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.310
 I notice it's really light 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.380
 Today , the topic is moving backwards 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.910
 we have never reported it 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.680
 a big topic 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.660
 I'm just interested in what 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:42.480
 is new here on the new c3 carbon like 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.879
 the name suggests it is here that 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.850
 material which is normally at our 3 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.190
 back made of aluminum will be made 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.090
 here carbon is used you can see it too 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.489
 here on the back 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.800
 These decreases are active 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.600
 users thought the normal back 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.890
 but I have the tension 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.660
 just want to get stuck 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.789
 because you have more possibilities 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.460
 setting angle adjustment depths 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.990
 setting height adjustment and if 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.939
 Here you can see the back is almost like that 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.439
 as light as a normal covering 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.630
 various docking systems here 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.070
 once a fixed system for steel frames 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.080
 chairs and we also have one 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.020
 Detachable system which I immediately from the c3 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.490
 back show the back also at 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.890
 fall despite chair when the chair folded 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.299
 it will be taken away even then 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.390
 can be and the chair too 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.119
 Folding mechanism both looks at that is 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.810
 in principle like the shell of the back and 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.909
 this is a carbon too very fashionable 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.930
 that is what is now on the 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.490
 fair here is presented new 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.920
 but i still have a question what is 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.490
 mainly the target group at fixed 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.830
 move 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.350
 the target audience is really the active one 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.050
 users like me, for example , I have 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.510
 a paraplegia ch 12 the 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.790
 Just say I want more comfort 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.740
 you know it from the normal chair if 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.200
 You sit if you have a good backrest 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.180
 you can just be more comfortable 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.350
 sit more stable and with one back 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.840
 It is already covered 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.270
 possible but a fixed back system 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.560
 offers here simply more stop and 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:14.330
 better positioning and therefore also 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.340
 sit uncomfortable when you are here 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.010
 better relatively small 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.560
 I say talk behind us there 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.750
 Of course you can choose different sizes 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.400
 as you say the cross section hears 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.040
 the higher should be the back or 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.780
 put wrong there is already wrong 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.300
 but it's not just about height 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.489
 it is also about a deep so we 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.160
 yes have a leadership deep that 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.470
 the side guidance is guaranteed 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.540
 in the case of the carbon, there are only two left 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.160
 Piece of the flat and middle contour 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.590
 that means we really only try that 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.650
 to get more active user have the 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.570
 We also in aluminum like here 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.160
 Of course he is twice as heavy 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:56.900
 But aluminum is in the back area 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.730
 Often, too, they often become or become too 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.220
 back used the halt in page 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.100
 must give as we see now 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.440
 are our three back with a deep 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.440
 contour and how to recognize it well here 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.940
 is there really a side guide 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.360
 I always explain that's how it is 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.860
 if you sit in the car a good sport 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.950
 in the car that means one has also 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.799
 side guidance and thus easy 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.810
 better sit more pages stability the 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.030
 Positioning becomes symmetrical man 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.200
 means sitting symmetrically in the chair has 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.720
 just a better stop 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.070
 that is that we are done here hangs 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.320
 then partly from the of the 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.610
 paralysis height so once the height it 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.350
 There are also different heights 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.060
 carboxylic 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.710
 but it also depends very much on the 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.440
 contour lower how many pages 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.560
 Support must be back 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.690
 guarantee 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.400
 and if just great page guidance 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.560
 needed then we have here 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.960
 We also have different cultures 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.700
 you can offer accordingly 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.950
 say what wheelchairs will be 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.380
 Mainly used on Canada 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.660
 is there in the theme of found wheelchair or 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.370
 steel frame big issue in such 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.750
 back really does not matter 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.440
 because it works both as well as 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.900
 So you can back the lawyer and 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.400
 staring at chairs on a case 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.790
 wheelchair I can do it all here 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.940
 in short, this demonstrates the case 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.560
 Mechanism is preserved 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.350
 then the possibility of what we have now 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.290
 if only two smell forward 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.140
 folded 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.820
 and already the enormous pressure is that 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.280
 All man in wheelchair and principle 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.860
 what is grown is left 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.780
 to every wheelchair so of course 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.150
 our wheelchairs on the soko wheelchairs 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.160
 but also to our products 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.510
 Competitors is a jam I can 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.440
 attach later here 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:45.480
 and then the folding mechanism stays 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.250
 I received that last again 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.260
 can behave normally and if you can 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.030
 stand back normally used then it works 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.470
 as easy as it has just gone away 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.920
 so easy is the whole again 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.690
 tuned 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.640
 that's all the system is again 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.130
 Immediately fixed again can not 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.870
 go out by yourself, but that's about it 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.300
 To unlock these two again 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.010
 Hebelchen here again forward 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.690
 be pressed and then you can 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.710
 take back you hear it completely 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.270
 short click 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.450
 the click is quasi that of 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.760
 Mechanism is solved at star frame 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:17.970
 There are chairs in the carbon back 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.770
 also fixed systems because you have to 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.310
 Do not turn around at the rigid student 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.140
 remove 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.460
 you can let him tune and then save 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.200
 of course, again weight because this 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.120
 Systems are then attached to the wheelchair 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.380
 screwed on normally and the back 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.900
 can then simply folded forward 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.880
 be and stay tuned and if I am 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.920
 also wheelchair then you take 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.770
 the system here with the back system 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.410
 that it also knows how to lose weight 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.819
 So somehow already great many 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.129
 thanks i learned something new that 

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:45.080
 always very important bridge has me 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:46.610
 always interested in us 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.250
 at the apache we have one too 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:53.180
 components of it is then, of course, too 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:55.400
 possible times from his back graz the 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.650
 carbon back or your other back 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.199
 could you make compatible here 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.090
 no problem no matter which one 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:03.949
 if you use so'n apache times 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.060
 a little more side guidance then I would 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:07.639
 probably more likely to indulge in such 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.259
 go system and if it is just like you 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:11.690
 now have fitter upper body and you 

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:13.639
 just want a better system 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.139
 have and better back system then 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:17.509
 this back is very easy 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:19.520
 also on such a part we to make the 

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:20.539
 The advantage is not only that it is solid 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.740
 but the advantage you can see it too 

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:23.479
 here at the long holes 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.460
 we have the possibility then suddenly 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:26.810
 a wheelchair in the back angle 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.009
 set and we can even 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.719
 vary times the height 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:31.520
 So that's what I usually do with it 

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:33.800
 the covering or with the wheelchair 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.819
 I have difficulties with the right one 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.670
 position to find 

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:40.290
 this is possible with the back system 

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:42.120
 he thank many waves 

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:44.730
 Information why we got 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.750
 by sunrise medical jürgen once 

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:51.080
 thank you 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:51.080
 See you soon, your life and walls and juries
