00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.970
 he was tied tight to a tree in the forest 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.280
 further from the road but also put on 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.570
 a muzzle so as not to bark for several days 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.210
 from rare breed 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.180
 airedale terrier spent in the cold found 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.240
 the poor fellow accidentally found him 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.369

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.640
 the reason the dog has become and I need not 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.380
 known but the fact is that maybe 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.140
 played out maybe just became not 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.750
 need a dog just tied in the woods on 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.670
 a leash to a tree in a muzzle that is 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.070
 the dog was unable to not bite 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.559
 leash not eat nothing drink 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.050
 This is for sure visible so that well 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.410
 killed dogs either hunger or cold 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.539
 he was frostbitten paws that is it 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.910
 everything was in burns in precisely such in 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.559
 thermal dog handlers ascertains 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.030
 cruel environment sometimes reaches 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.100
 unprecedented sophistication 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.230
 but this case is really out of the ordinary 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.460
 over the last year in the city has been a 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.410
 sad trend 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.809
 people massively get rid of their 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.990
 pets among dogs refuse come

 hordes and pit bull terriers people just don't 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.110
 I understand they take a purebred dog 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.400
 I do not understand , and the breed features 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.509
 there is a breed implied by itself 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.570
 certain breed qualities 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.729
 certain behavior model you here 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.799
 somehow a person prefers 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.409
 that's how to get rid of something that's so 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.100
 way either to throw out on the street or 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.740
 to tie 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.360
 in the forest near the tree, that is enough 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.360

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:50.729
