00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.250
 island 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.059
 I'm on an island you can look in the 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.260
 map 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.870
 I'm going in the water and I'm going to 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.830
 dive you have to select your 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.570
 Beast with her underwater you alone 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.850
 need to give a shot 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.340
 the players to kill they do not need 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.549
 more than this need not only target 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.930
 just shoot it's easy easy easy 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.479
 anyone can make follow 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:26.159
 quietly in case you do not find 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:28.560
 there your player only pay attention 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.049
 use your head a little , you go where 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.689
 they do not need and much of them 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.479
 started a shot miralla a shot kills a shot 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.119
 It's not like you're not born to be quiet. 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.100
 well here the one where I was here I 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.759
 I was lucky to find exactly what they 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:48.149
 born he looks he would say he was born and the 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.649
 the screen is born then the Swiss depends on 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.920
 How long will you be able to stay? 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.920

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.630
 doing this you get level 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.729
 quickly 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.259

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.500
 experience killing these critters here 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.989
 So who has the patience who? 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.580
 Do you want to lightly climb? 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.459

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.349
 who still can not is that he was the 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.349

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:20.000

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.519

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:40.880

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.739
 I just took a little breath here. 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:47.000

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:51.440
