00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.750 

I<00:00:00.089> was<00:00:01.050> talking<00:00:01.469> to<00:00:01.589> some<00:00:01.829> motion<00:00:02.399> graphics

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
I was talking to some motion graphics

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.220 
I was talking to some motion graphics
artist<00:00:03.120> the<00:00:03.210> other<00:00:03.360> day<00:00:03.540> and<00:00:03.720> they<00:00:03.780> mentioned

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
artist the other day and they mentioned

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.960 
artist the other day and they mentioned
when<00:00:04.890> they<00:00:05.009> animate<00:00:05.339> with<00:00:05.460> cameras<00:00:05.850> they

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
when they animate with cameras they

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.110 
when they animate with cameras they
typically<00:00:06.420> put<00:00:06.960> cameras<00:00:07.350> inside<00:00:07.710> of<00:00:07.890> nulls<00:00:08.160> so

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
typically put cameras inside of nulls so

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.339 
typically put cameras inside of nulls so
I<00:00:09.150> kind<00:00:09.360> of<00:00:09.389> wanted<00:00:09.599> to<00:00:09.750> demonstrate<00:00:09.900> what

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
I kind of wanted to demonstrate what

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.470 
I kind of wanted to demonstrate what
that<00:00:10.500> meant<00:00:10.679> exactly<00:00:10.860> so<00:00:11.460> there's<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.300> couple

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
that meant exactly so there's a couple

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.150 
that meant exactly so there's a couple
ways<00:00:12.660> of<00:00:12.900> thinking<00:00:13.019> moles<00:00:13.410> or<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:13.799> get<00:00:13.950> them

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
ways of thinking moles or to get them

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.950 
ways of thinking moles or to get them
you<00:00:14.280> can<00:00:14.429> get<00:00:14.580> them<00:00:14.639> up<00:00:14.910> here<00:00:14.940> create<00:00:15.690> an<00:00:15.780> OLE

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
you can get them up here create an OLE

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
you can get them up here create an OLE
object<00:00:16.340> where<00:00:17.340> you<00:00:17.430> can<00:00:17.609> group<00:00:18.710> something<00:00:19.710> and

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
object where you can group something and

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.080 
object where you can group something and
it<00:00:20.070> puts<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.369> inside<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.850> an<00:00:20.939> OLE

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
it puts it inside of an OLE

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.870 
it puts it inside of an OLE
automatically<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.890> depending<00:00:23.699> on<00:00:23.760> how

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
automatically and the depending on how

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.089 
automatically and the depending on how
you<00:00:23.939> do<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.510> has<00:00:24.660> different<00:00:24.840> uses<00:00:25.470> so<00:00:25.920> for

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
you do that it has different uses so for

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.179 
you do that it has different uses so for
instance<00:00:26.160> if<00:00:26.580> I<00:00:26.670> wanted<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.000> do<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.410> rotation<00:00:28.410> of

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
instance if I wanted to do a rotation of

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.690 
instance if I wanted to do a rotation of
the<00:00:29.369> camera<00:00:29.760> around<00:00:29.910> this<00:00:30.529> object<00:00:31.700> the

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
the camera around this object the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.310 
the camera around this object the
easiest<00:00:33.090> way<00:00:33.210> would<00:00:33.239> be<00:00:33.510> for<00:00:33.660> me<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:33.960> create<00:00:34.230> my

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
easiest way would be for me to create my

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.610 
easiest way would be for me to create my
camera<00:00:34.770> here<00:00:35.450> so<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.690> cameras<00:00:37.050> wherever<00:00:37.410> my

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
camera here so the cameras wherever my

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.440 
camera here so the cameras wherever my
view<00:00:37.890> is<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.309> it's<00:00:38.399> looking<00:00:38.579> at<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.969> object

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
view is and it's looking at the object

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.470 
view is and it's looking at the object
if<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.469> create<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:41.010> null<00:00:41.280> object<00:00:41.820> that

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
if I create a null object that

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.330 
if I create a null object that
automatically<00:00:43.260> gets<00:00:43.500> put<00:00:43.800> in<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:43.980> center<00:00:44.280> of

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
automatically gets put in the center of

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.049 
automatically gets put in the center of
the<00:00:44.489> world<00:00:44.899> so<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:45.930> can<00:00:46.289> just<00:00:46.320> simply<00:00:46.860> drag<00:00:47.850> that

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
the world so I can just simply drag that

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.930 
the world so I can just simply drag that
in<00:00:48.239> there<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:49.309> then<00:00:50.309> keyframe<00:00:50.960> the<00:00:51.960> heading

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
in there and then keyframe the heading

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.279 
in there and then keyframe the heading
of<00:00:53.940> this<00:00:54.210> object<00:00:54.620> so<00:00:55.670> just<00:00:56.670> do<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:57.030> food<00:00:57.809> say

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
of this object so just do that food say

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.899 
of this object so just do that food say
360<00:00:59.070> and<00:01:00.320> so<00:01:01.320> what<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.500> does<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:03.379> basically

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
360 and so what that does is basically

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.219 
360 and so what that does is basically
rotates<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.030> parent<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.689> cameras<00:01:07.110> in

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
rotates the parent and the cameras in

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.530 
rotates the parent and the cameras in
place<00:01:07.610> so<00:01:08.610> if<00:01:08.670> we<00:01:08.760> just<00:01:08.939> kind<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.150> look<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.390> it

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
place so if we just kind of look to it

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.910 
place so if we just kind of look to it
through<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.350> get<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.650> kind<00:01:10.830> of

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
through it you get that kind of

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.649 
through it you get that kind of
animation<00:01:13.280> so<00:01:14.280> let's<00:01:14.460> undo<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.119> show

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
animation so let's undo that and show

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.910 
animation so let's undo that and show
the<00:01:15.810> difference<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.380> if<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.549> had<00:01:17.790> not<00:01:18.920> created

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
the difference of if I had not created

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.640 
the difference of if I had not created
the<00:01:20.280> null<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.759> way<00:01:20.939> if<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:22.020> head<00:01:22.200> instead

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
the null that way if I head instead

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.149 
the null that way if I head instead
select<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.549> object<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.090> hit<00:01:24.210> option<00:01:24.630> G<00:01:25.159> Dean

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
select the object and hit option G Dean

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.450 
select the object and hit option G Dean
all<00:01:26.310> gets<00:01:26.700> placed<00:01:27.000> where<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.450> camera<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:28.460> so

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
all gets placed where the camera is so

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.270 
all gets placed where the camera is so
now<00:01:29.700> if<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.090> were<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.390> rotate<00:01:30.570> this<00:01:31.380> null<00:01:31.770> object

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
now if I were to rotate this null object

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.999 
now if I were to rotate this null object
which<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.549> can<00:01:32.700> see<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:32.970> also<00:01:33.090> came<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.600> at<00:01:33.750> a

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
which you can see it also came in at a

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.100 
which you can see it also came in at a
different<00:01:35.009> heading<00:01:35.780> because<00:01:36.780> it's<00:01:36.930> basically

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
different heading because it's basically

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.370 
different heading because it's basically
where<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.650> camera<00:01:38.009> is<00:01:38.600> in<00:01:39.600> this<00:01:39.960> instance

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
where the camera is in this instance

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.830 
where the camera is in this instance
it's<00:01:40.590> not<00:01:40.740> really<00:01:41.009> going<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.220> help<00:01:41.369> me<00:01:41.840> so

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
it's not really going to help me so

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.350 
it's not really going to help me so
that's<00:01:43.619> one<00:01:43.829> way<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:44.040> use<00:01:44.340> nulls<00:01:45.060> and

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
that's one way to use nulls and

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.450 
that's one way to use nulls and
parenting<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.740> other<00:01:46.890> way<00:01:47.070> they<00:01:47.220> talked

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
parenting the other way they talked

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.130 
parenting the other way they talked
about<00:01:47.579> was<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.299> idea<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:50.479> creating<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.659> null

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
about was the idea of creating a null

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.639 
about was the idea of creating a null
for<00:01:52.470> each<00:01:52.710> movement<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.790> might<00:01:53.970> want<00:01:54.649> so

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
for each movement that you might want so

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.899 
for each movement that you might want so
let's<00:01:56.070> go<00:01:56.219> ahead<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.990> create<00:01:58.700> i'm<00:01:59.700> going<00:01:59.850> to

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
let's go ahead and create i'm going to

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.260 
let's go ahead and create i'm going to
option<00:02:00.240> G<00:02:00.390> group<00:02:00.689> this<00:02:01.850> and<00:02:02.850> I'm<00:02:03.060> going<00:02:03.210> to

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
option G group this and I'm going to

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.789 
option G group this and I'm going to
call<00:02:03.479> this<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:04.219> X<00:02:05.420> motion<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.799> that's

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
call this the X motion and that's

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.650 
call this the X motion and that's
because<00:02:08.129> I'm<00:02:08.310> going<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.700> grab<00:02:08.849> it<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.390> move

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
because I'm going to grab it and move

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
because I'm going to grab it and move
the<00:02:09.989> camera<00:02:10.259> along<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.160> x<00:02:11.340> axis<00:02:11.580> like<00:02:12.030> a<00:02:12.060> dolly

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
the camera along the x axis like a dolly

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.709 
the camera along the x axis like a dolly
so<00:02:14.640> if<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:14.819> want<00:02:15.000> you<00:02:15.150> can<00:02:15.269> kind<00:02:15.480> of<00:02:15.510> look

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:15.719 
so if you want you can kind of look

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:17.270 
so if you want you can kind of look
through<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.019> at<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.230> same<00:02:16.319> time<00:02:16.739> to<00:02:16.980> see<00:02:17.129> what

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
through it at the same time to see what

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.759 
through it at the same time to see what
you<00:02:17.370> would<00:02:17.489> see<00:02:18.349> so<00:02:19.349> let's<00:02:19.439> go<00:02:19.620> ahead<00:02:19.650> and

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
you would see so let's go ahead and

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:25.459 
you would see so let's go ahead and
animate<00:02:20.519> this<00:02:22.700> and<00:02:23.840> I'm<00:02:24.840> animating<00:02:25.349> the

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:25.469 
animate this and I'm animating the

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:29.240 
animate this and I'm animating the
parent<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.329> then<00:02:27.329> go<00:02:28.019> to<00:02:28.079> 90<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:28.950> we're<00:02:29.069> just

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
parent and then go to 90 and we're just

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.759 
parent and then go to 90 and we're just
kind<00:02:29.489> of<00:02:29.689> rotated<00:02:30.689> just<00:02:30.870> moving<00:02:31.230> along<00:02:31.349> that

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
kind of rotated just moving along that

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:37.009 
kind of rotated just moving along that
axis<00:02:34.280> so<00:02:35.280> that<00:02:35.310> gives<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:35.909> nice<00:02:36.060> smooth<00:02:36.750> motion

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
axis so that gives a nice smooth motion

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.500 
axis so that gives a nice smooth motion
left<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:37.650> right<00:02:37.859> let's<00:02:38.760> look<00:02:38.939> for<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.209> camera

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
left to right let's look for the camera

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.129 
left to right let's look for the camera
view<00:02:40.670> and<00:02:41.670> what<00:02:41.819> i<00:02:41.849> could<00:02:41.939> do<00:02:42.269> is<00:02:42.299> continue<00:02:42.810> to

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:43.139 
view and what i could do is continue to

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:47.599 
view and what i could do is continue to
animate<00:02:43.560> this<00:02:45.109> but<00:02:46.109> instead<00:02:46.739> i'm<00:02:47.099> going<00:02:47.159> to

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:47.609 
animate this but instead i'm going to

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:50.479 
animate this but instead i'm going to
animate<00:02:48.389> just<00:02:48.689> a<00:02:48.780> camera<00:02:49.049> zoom<00:02:49.530> so<00:02:50.280> i'm<00:02:50.370> going

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
animate just a camera zoom so i'm going

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.020 
animate just a camera zoom so i'm going
to<00:02:50.549> grab<00:02:50.669> this<00:02:50.939> camera<00:02:51.450> at<00:02:51.840> option<00:02:52.379> G<00:02:53.030> i'm

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
to grab this camera at option G i'm

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.589 
to grab this camera at option G i'm
going<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:54.239> call<00:02:54.329> this<00:02:54.510> z<00:02:55.099> motion<00:02:56.099> and<00:02:56.599> then

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
going to call this z motion and then

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.270 
going to call this z motion and then
this<00:02:57.780> kind<00:02:58.049> of<00:02:58.139> going<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:58.349> animate<00:02:58.560> a<00:02:58.950> little

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
this kind of going to animate a little

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.860 
this kind of going to animate a little
bit<00:02:59.370> more<00:02:59.579> how<00:03:00.209> it<00:03:00.389> would<00:03:00.540> actually<00:03:02.450> do<00:03:03.450> it<00:03:03.629> so

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
bit more how it would actually do it so

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.940 
bit more how it would actually do it so
make<00:03:04.349> grab<00:03:04.819> this<00:03:05.819> object<00:03:06.389> and<00:03:06.680> you<00:03:07.680> can<00:03:07.799> see

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
make grab this object and you can see

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.619 
make grab this object and you can see
the<00:03:07.980> coordinates<00:03:08.489> are<00:03:08.609> 0<00:03:08.939> because<00:03:09.299> it's<00:03:09.450> right

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
the coordinates are 0 because it's right

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.349 
the coordinates are 0 because it's right
inside<00:03:09.810> of<00:03:10.169> the<00:03:10.290> other<00:03:10.439> one<00:03:10.739> but<00:03:11.730> for<00:03:12.000> this<00:03:12.090> one

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
inside of the other one but for this one

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.020 
inside of the other one but for this one
I<00:03:12.389> want<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:12.810> animate<00:03:13.409> just<00:03:13.859> the<00:03:14.040> zoom<00:03:14.340> on<00:03:14.669> the<00:03:14.819> z

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
I want to animate just the zoom on the z

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.280 
I want to animate just the zoom on the z
axis<00:03:15.889> so<00:03:16.889> I'm<00:03:16.980> going<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.159> start<00:03:17.430> at<00:03:17.639> a<00:03:17.760> zero

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
axis so I'm going to start at a zero

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.520 
axis so I'm going to start at a zero
zoom<00:03:19.290> and<00:03:20.090> then<00:03:21.090> at<00:03:21.389> the<00:03:21.419> end<00:03:21.569> I'm<00:03:22.290> going<00:03:22.440> to

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
zoom and then at the end I'm going to

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.080 
zoom and then at the end I'm going to
have<00:03:22.680> a<00:03:22.709> sort<00:03:23.159> of<00:03:23.220> zoom<00:03:23.639> out<00:03:23.879> so<00:03:25.909> I'm<00:03:26.909> just

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
have a sort of zoom out so I'm just

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.259 
have a sort of zoom out so I'm just
going<00:03:27.239> to<00:03:27.299> ctrl<00:03:27.780> click<00:03:28.139> on<00:03:28.500> that<00:03:28.970> so<00:03:29.970> I'm<00:03:30.060> kind

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
going to ctrl click on that so I'm kind

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:31.969 
going to ctrl click on that so I'm kind
of<00:03:30.299> layering<00:03:30.599> my<00:03:30.930> motions<00:03:31.379> I've<00:03:31.500> got<00:03:31.650> two<00:03:31.769> left

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:31.979 
of layering my motions I've got two left

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:37.280 
of layering my motions I've got two left
to<00:03:32.129> right<00:03:32.340> motion<00:03:33.139> using<00:03:34.139> the<00:03:34.560> Z<00:03:35.870> let<00:03:36.870> me<00:03:36.959> using

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
to right motion using the Z let me using

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.559 
to right motion using the Z let me using
the<00:03:37.439> X<00:03:37.709> and<00:03:38.040> then<00:03:38.129> as<00:03:38.310> e<00:03:38.579> to<00:03:38.760> kind<00:03:39.060> of<00:03:39.150> zoom<00:03:39.389> out

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
the X and then as e to kind of zoom out

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.409 
the X and then as e to kind of zoom out
at<00:03:39.780> the<00:03:39.870> same<00:03:40.079> time<00:03:40.319> an<00:03:40.970> advantage<00:03:41.970> of<00:03:42.120> that<00:03:42.239> is

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:42.419 
at the same time an advantage of that is

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:44.539 
at the same time an advantage of that is
I'm<00:03:42.540> sort<00:03:42.810> of<00:03:42.900> keeping<00:03:43.769> these<00:03:43.889> on<00:03:44.069> separate

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
I'm sort of keeping these on separate

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.749 
I'm sort of keeping these on separate
tracks<00:03:45.409> so<00:03:46.409> the<00:03:46.859> last<00:03:47.069> thing<00:03:47.220> I<00:03:47.400> might<00:03:47.549> want<00:03:47.669> to

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:47.759 
tracks so the last thing I might want to

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:49.999 
tracks so the last thing I might want to
do<00:03:47.909> is<00:03:48.299> one<00:03:49.199> thing<00:03:49.379> that<00:03:49.409> can<00:03:49.620> actually<00:03:49.739> be<00:03:49.949> a

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:50.009 
do is one thing that can actually be a

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:52.909 
do is one thing that can actually be a
really<00:03:50.220> difficult<00:03:51.650> animation<00:03:52.650> and<00:03:52.769> that's

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919 
really difficult animation and that's

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.610 
really difficult animation and that's
sort<00:03:53.250> of<00:03:53.310> like<00:03:53.370> a<00:03:53.549> barrel<00:03:54.060> roll<00:03:54.319> so<00:03:55.319> let's<00:03:55.560> say

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
sort of like a barrel roll so let's say

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.309 
sort of like a barrel roll so let's say
I<00:03:55.739> wanted<00:03:55.979> to<00:03:56.099> animate<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:57.180> z<00:03:57.419> axis<00:03:57.449> and<00:03:58.169> do

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
I wanted to animate the z axis and do

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.159 
I wanted to animate the z axis and do
this<00:03:58.500> kind<00:03:58.769> of<00:03:58.799> a<00:03:58.949> roll<00:03:59.720> it's<00:04:00.720> really

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:01.169 
this kind of a roll it's really

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:03.679 
this kind of a roll it's really
difficult<00:04:01.379> if<00:04:01.889> your<00:04:02.099> key<00:04:02.400> framing<00:04:02.759> all<00:04:03.090> three

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:03.689 
difficult if your key framing all three

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:05.899 
difficult if your key framing all three
XY<00:04:04.530> heading<00:04:04.979> pitch<00:04:05.129> and<00:04:05.310> bank<00:04:05.459> at<00:04:05.609> the<00:04:05.639> same

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:05.909 
XY heading pitch and bank at the same

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:07.939 
XY heading pitch and bank at the same
time<00:04:06.180> so<00:04:07.109> this<00:04:07.259> is<00:04:07.439> a<00:04:07.470> really<00:04:07.680> good<00:04:07.889> example

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:07.949 
time so this is a really good example

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:11.539 
time so this is a really good example
where<00:04:08.639> you<00:04:08.759> would<00:04:08.909> want<00:04:09.090> to<00:04:09.889> group<00:04:10.889> those<00:04:11.159> so

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
where you would want to group those so

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.020 
where you would want to group those so
let's<00:04:11.759> just<00:04:11.970> say<00:04:12.180> at<00:04:12.540> this<00:04:12.810> point<00:04:13.819> let's<00:04:14.819> go

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
let's just say at this point let's go

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.629 
let's just say at this point let's go
ahead<00:04:15.120> and<00:04:15.209> do<00:04:15.449> an<00:04:15.599> option<00:04:15.989> G<00:04:18.169> to<00:04:19.169> group<00:04:19.349> it<00:04:19.639> I'm

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
ahead and do an option G to group it I'm

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.050 
ahead and do an option G to group it I'm
going<00:04:20.880> through<00:04:21.209> Z<00:04:21.860> rotation

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
going through Z rotation

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.280 
going through Z rotation
and<00:04:24.660> again<00:04:25.560> we<00:04:26.130> want<00:04:26.340> to<00:04:26.570> see<00:04:27.570> which<00:04:27.720> axis<00:04:28.169> is

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
and again we want to see which axis is

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.930 
and again we want to see which axis is
going<00:04:28.440> to<00:04:28.500> move<00:04:28.740> its<00:04:29.040> the<00:04:29.220> bank<00:04:29.490> like<00:04:29.820> I

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
going to move its the bank like I

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.270 
going to move its the bank like I
thought<00:04:30.150> it<00:04:30.270> was<00:04:30.389> going<00:04:30.540> to<00:04:30.630> be<00:04:30.720> and<00:04:31.220> so<00:04:32.220> I

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
thought it was going to be and so I

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.500 
thought it was going to be and so I
control<00:04:32.760> click<00:04:33.090> that<00:04:33.990> and<00:04:35.180> let's<00:04:36.180> just<00:04:36.360> do<00:04:36.450> a

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
control click that and let's just do a

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:43.150 
control click that and let's just do a
really<00:04:36.720> quick<00:04:37.760> 360<00:04:38.760> degree<00:04:39.300> barrel<00:04:39.810> roll<00:04:41.930> and

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
really quick 360 degree barrel roll and

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.250 
really quick 360 degree barrel roll and
so<00:04:44.160> that's<00:04:44.340> just<00:04:44.490> animating<00:04:45.270> a<00:04:45.330> single<00:04:45.750> axis

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
so that's just animating a single axis

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.950 
so that's just animating a single axis
and<00:04:47.450> it<00:04:48.450> creates<00:04:48.810> like<00:04:49.020> this<00:04:49.169> nice<00:04:49.730> smooth

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
and it creates like this nice smooth

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.520 
and it creates like this nice smooth
rotation<00:04:51.960> and<00:04:52.620> it's<00:04:52.740> somewhat<00:04:53.340> controllable

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
rotation and it's somewhat controllable

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.690 
rotation and it's somewhat controllable
whereas<00:04:55.530> if<00:04:55.680> you're<00:04:55.830> trying<00:04:56.010> to<00:04:56.160> animate<00:04:56.550> all

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
whereas if you're trying to animate all

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.879 
whereas if you're trying to animate all
things<00:04:56.970> that<00:04:57.150> wants<00:04:57.450> it's<00:04:57.570> a<00:04:57.630> lot<00:04:57.840> trickier<00:04:58.560> to

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
things that wants it's a lot trickier to

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:03.740 
things that wants it's a lot trickier to
sort<00:04:59.190> of<00:04:59.250> keep<00:05:00.180> track<00:05:00.450> of<00:05:01.639> so<00:05:02.639> you<00:05:03.510> can<00:05:03.630> have

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
sort of keep track of so you can have

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.120 
sort of keep track of so you can have
you<00:05:03.960> know<00:05:04.020> as<00:05:04.200> many<00:05:04.350> of<00:05:04.500> these<00:05:04.590> as<00:05:04.650> you<00:05:04.889> want<00:05:05.070> to

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
you know as many of these as you want to

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.580 
you know as many of these as you want to
be<00:05:05.280> up<00:05:05.370> to<00:05:05.460> 10<00:05:05.729> but<00:05:06.479> it's<00:05:06.660> a<00:05:06.720> really<00:05:06.990> nice<00:05:07.200> idea

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
be up to 10 but it's a really nice idea

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.740 
be up to 10 but it's a really nice idea
to<00:05:07.650> animate<00:05:08.040> just<00:05:08.220> one<00:05:08.460> parameter<00:05:08.820> on<00:05:09.330> each

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
to animate just one parameter on each

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.480 
to animate just one parameter on each
one<00:05:10.020> of<00:05:10.080> these<00:05:10.260> so<00:05:10.470> that<00:05:10.590> your<00:05:10.710> timeline<00:05:11.160> stays

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
one of these so that your timeline stays

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.490 
one of these so that your timeline stays
in<00:05:11.669> control<00:05:11.729> and<00:05:12.270> you<00:05:13.020> can<00:05:13.400> still<00:05:14.400> maintain

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
in control and you can still maintain

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.750 
in control and you can still maintain
control<00:05:16.500> over<00:05:16.620> your<00:05:16.860> animation<00:05:17.340> I<00:05:17.370> guess<00:05:17.520> just

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
control over your animation I guess just

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.990 
control over your animation I guess just
to<00:05:18.150> demonstrate<00:05:18.979> advantage<00:05:19.979> of<00:05:20.160> this<00:05:20.280> barrel

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
to demonstrate advantage of this barrel

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.379 
to demonstrate advantage of this barrel
roll<00:05:21.389> idea<00:05:22.020> i'm<00:05:22.169> going<00:05:22.320> to<00:05:22.380> create<00:05:22.760> a<00:05:23.760> pitch

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:24.389 
roll idea i'm going to create a pitch

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:28.279 
roll idea i'm going to create a pitch
rotation<00:05:25.080> or<00:05:25.200> x<00:05:25.380> axis<00:05:25.830> so<00:05:26.070> it's<00:05:26.970> option<00:05:27.419> G<00:05:27.990> that

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:28.289 
rotation or x axis so it's option G that

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:31.100 
rotation or x axis so it's option G that
and<00:05:28.590> let's<00:05:28.979> see<00:05:29.160> it's<00:05:29.280> gonna<00:05:29.400> be<00:05:29.990> so<00:05:30.990> that's

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
and let's see it's gonna be so that's

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.880 
and let's see it's gonna be so that's
going<00:05:31.260> to<00:05:31.320> be<00:05:31.410> a<00:05:31.440> pitch<00:05:33.110> so<00:05:34.110> actually<00:05:34.530> I<00:05:34.590> can<00:05:34.770> do

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:34.890 
going to be a pitch so actually I can do

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.390 
going to be a pitch so actually I can do
pitch<00:05:35.210> rotation<00:05:36.500> bank<00:05:37.500> and<00:05:37.830> z<00:05:38.010> are<00:05:38.039> kind<00:05:38.370> of

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
pitch rotation bank and z are kind of

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.190 
pitch rotation bank and z are kind of
similar<00:05:38.610> but<00:05:38.880> less<00:05:39.000> would<00:05:39.330> be<00:05:39.360> just<00:05:39.900> you<00:05:40.080> know

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.200 
similar but less would be just you know

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.779 
similar but less would be just you know
we're<00:05:40.410> doing<00:05:40.970> so<00:05:41.970> with<00:05:42.270> the<00:05:42.390> pitch<00:05:42.419> I<00:05:43.520> can<00:05:44.520> kind

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:44.789 
we're doing so with the pitch I can kind

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:48.890 
we're doing so with the pitch I can kind
of<00:05:44.880> thumb<00:05:45.650> animate<00:05:46.650> it<00:05:46.770> there<00:05:47.479> and<00:05:48.479> then<00:05:48.660> in

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
of thumb animate it there and then in

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.690 
of thumb animate it there and then in
the<00:05:48.990> middle<00:05:49.229> of<00:05:49.260> the<00:05:49.320> barrel<00:05:49.740> roll<00:05:49.919> I<00:05:50.220> may<00:05:50.460> want

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:50.700 
the middle of the barrel roll I may want

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.520 
the middle of the barrel roll I may want
the<00:05:50.930> pitch<00:05:51.930> to<00:05:52.169> sort<00:05:52.470> of<00:05:52.530> go<00:05:52.740> up<00:05:53.070> or<00:05:53.280> down<00:05:54.530> and

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 
the pitch to sort of go up or down and

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.190 
the pitch to sort of go up or down and
change<00:05:55.800> it<00:05:56.010> just<00:05:56.160> a<00:05:56.280> little<00:05:56.310> bit<00:05:56.990> but<00:05:57.990> then

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:58.200 
change it just a little bit but then

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:04.730 
change it just a little bit but then
come<00:05:58.560> back<00:05:58.590> up<00:05:58.830> to<00:05:59.389> 0<00:06:00.740> at<00:06:01.740> this<00:06:02.100> point<00:06:03.680> so<00:06:04.680> it

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
come back up to 0 at this point so it

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.219 
come back up to 0 at this point so it
kind<00:06:04.950> of<00:06:05.010> allows<00:06:05.550> you<00:06:05.820> a<00:06:05.910> lot<00:06:06.240> of<00:06:06.389> control<00:06:06.810> sort

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:07.229 
kind of allows you a lot of control sort

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:12.620 
kind of allows you a lot of control sort
of<00:06:07.320> over<00:06:07.710> all<00:06:08.450> aspects<00:06:09.450> of<00:06:09.660> your<00:06:09.720> thing<00:06:11.630> so

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:12.630 
of over all aspects of your thing so

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.860 
of over all aspects of your thing so
that's<00:06:12.900> our<00:06:13.260> using<00:06:13.650> dolls
