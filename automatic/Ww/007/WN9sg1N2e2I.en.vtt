a high mid so that's nice it's kind of

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.350 
a high mid so that's nice it's kind of
two<00:01:09.740> separate<00:01:10.190> mid<00:01:10.400> controls<00:01:10.850> for<00:01:11.060> the<00:01:11.180> lower

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
mid register and the higher mid register

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.910 
mid register and the higher mid register
so<00:01:13.730> you<00:01:13.820> can<00:01:13.970> really<00:01:14.180> get<00:01:14.510> that<00:01:14.720> full<00:01:15.470> range<00:01:15.680> of

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
so you can really get that full range of

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.820 
so you can really get that full range of
mid<00:01:16.190> tone<00:01:16.430> I<00:01:16.730> like<00:01:17.240> mid<00:01:17.480> in<00:01:17.690> my<00:01:17.840> guitar<00:01:18.170> tone<00:01:18.590> so

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
mid tone I like mid in my guitar tone so

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.560 
mid tone I like mid in my guitar tone so
I<00:01:18.860> like<00:01:19.130> that<00:01:19.159> they<00:01:19.400> have<00:01:19.580> two<00:01:19.820> mid<00:01:20.180> controls

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
I like that they have two mid controls

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.680 
I like that they have two mid controls
that's<00:01:20.990> exciting<00:01:21.620> and<00:01:22.420> so<00:01:23.420> then<00:01:23.570> you<00:01:23.659> have

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
that's exciting and so then you have

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.660 
that's exciting and so then you have
your<00:01:23.810> high<00:01:24.020> control<00:01:24.470> and<00:01:24.770> then<00:01:25.100> this<00:01:25.220> also<00:01:25.460> has

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
your high control and then this also has

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.420 
your high control and then this also has
a<00:01:25.729> CD<00:01:26.060> input<00:01:26.330> so<00:01:26.840> it's<00:01:26.960> nice<00:01:27.110> as<00:01:27.350> RCA<00:01:27.890> input<00:01:28.310> so

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
a CD input so it's nice as RCA input so

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.830 
a CD input so it's nice as RCA input so
you<00:01:28.460> can<00:01:28.580> plug<00:01:28.700> a<00:01:28.850> CD<00:01:29.210> player<00:01:29.240> or<00:01:29.630> something

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
you can plug a CD player or something

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.920 
you can plug a CD player or something
like<00:01:30.080> that<00:01:30.140> into<00:01:30.530> it<00:01:30.830> and<00:01:31.270> jam<00:01:32.270> along<00:01:32.570> with<00:01:32.750> it

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930
