00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:46.579
 the video 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.309
 we're going to need some cookies like 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.799
 these snow of the flavor that you 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:55.789
 want colorants we are also going to 

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:57.469
 need strawberries and also jerjes 8 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.559
 colate of what you want can be 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:04.389
 nutella and some decorations to decorate 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.389
 cupcakes or cake and those 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.530
 Now what we are going to do is put a 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:13.500
 little bit of snow in a bowl or a small dish 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.420
 like this I want this to be colored 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.939
 purple so I'm going to add three 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.880
 droplets of red dye and a droplet 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.979
 of blue dye 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.320
 then let's mix and mix 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.469
 Mix until we have the color 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.469
 wanted 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.710
 and a little more blue so that 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.630
 it will be like between blue and purple now 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.579
 in the next container we are also going 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.329
 to do the same but this time with a 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.329
 different color 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.630
 I will add the desired droplets until 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.939
 I left a color like that of rosita 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.729
 very very clear stick because so what 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.619
 I want more fun this is that they can 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.509
 play with the colors my girls and of 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.700
 true that you will love this part 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.110
 it was the one that I liked the most, so 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.299
 I think you do too comes 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.729
 like and well here we continue with 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:07.039
 our next mix or rather 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:10.700
 our next color for this color 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:13.280
 I chose as a mint blue, let's say 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.590
 that it was a clear turquoise 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.090
 and he added droplets of color 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.270
 until I had the color that I 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.270
 wanted to 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.340
 and this was the result the truth is 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.620
 very cool 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.660
 now our last mix that is going to be 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.560
 how an orange color but very 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.569
 clarito 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.390
 there are many pastel colors so 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:36.680
 for this dessert I wanted to do it with 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.680
 good pastel colors 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.110
 now let's continue with the chocolate 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.180
 let's empty it in another container like 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.530
 this and we are going to heat it in the 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.530
 microwave for a minute 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.900
 after he has spent a few minutes and 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.120
 our chocolate shows is not good 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.480
 melted we're going to put it back another 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.480
 minute 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.760
 then we are going to chop our strawberries 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.400
 and for the final part we are going to gather 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:19.150
 all containers with snow in a 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.150
 I just breathe 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.569
 let's mix just a little bit because 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.420
 what we want is to join the colors more 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:31.430
 do not mix them completely 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.430
 until we have something like this 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.769
 here we have the chocolate after 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:42.930
 take it out of the microwave here we have the 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.930
 cookies and snow 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.960
 let's put some chocolate in 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.840
 the cookies 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:53.600
 then we will add the snows in 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.110
 the snow and finally we will add the 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.110
 three appointments 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.680
 all right 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.680
 Y 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.459
 i 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.150
 you can add chocolate if you 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:20.530
 they want over our dessert and 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.530
 this is the final result 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.440
 and this has been all for the video 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.990
 I'm the best dessert I 'm not very 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:33.270
 nice to know the speech that is the 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.270
 I guarantee and here we have them 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:39.780
 but I have not tried it as well as 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.680
 to sleep all and those things 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.680
 to see how 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:55.179
 why 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:58.529
 but this is very good indeed is 

00:04:55.179 --> 00:05:05.439
 very rich you can choose 

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:07.449
 the vanilla because I wanted to like that 

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:09.969
 add colors and that so that it 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:11.919
 I saw like that much prettier but I 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:15.990
 I think at a certain point I'm not staying 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:18.400
 also with would have liked 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.590
 good anyway 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.419
 they are very rich the truth is that I did not think 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.979
 who studies as much as he would have liked 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:26.500
 also find cookies are more 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:29.440
 big but those bigger than 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:31.000
 I found and well, yes, all the 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.550
 video today I hope to enter the 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.160
 chocolate less interest and I think that already 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.740
 It's all I do not know what else to say if I feel 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:42.360
 that I bring all the muddy mouth of 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.360
 honey chocolate 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.900
