00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
today we're going to melt that in the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.650 
today we're going to melt that in the
microwave<00:01:13.310> we're<00:01:14.310> going<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.490> set<00:01:14.730> that<00:01:14.880> for<00:01:15.120> 15

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 
microwave we're going to set that for 15

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.960 
microwave we're going to set that for 15
seconds<00:01:16.290> on<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:17.010> lowest<00:01:17.520> possible<00:01:17.730> heat<00:01:19.970> now

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
seconds on the lowest possible heat now

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.420 
seconds on the lowest possible heat now
what<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.180> does<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.930> chocolate<00:01:22.590> burns<00:01:22.860> really

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
really fast so we really need to set it

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.350 
really fast so we really need to set it
on<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.010> lowest<00:01:26.280> possible<00:01:26.670> heat<00:01:27.120> in<00:01:27.270> the

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
on the lowest possible heat in the

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.680 
on the lowest possible heat in the
microwave<00:01:28.310> after<00:01:29.310> 15<00:01:29.670> seconds<00:01:30.090> we're<00:01:30.540> going

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
microwave after 15 seconds we're going

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.720 
microwave after 15 seconds we're going
to<00:01:30.750> take<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.140> back<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.800> we're<00:01:32.250> going<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.400> stir

this back in the microwave for another
15<00:01:45.510> seconds<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.140> we'll<00:01:46.560> actually<00:01:46.920> repeat

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
15 seconds and we'll actually repeat

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.350 
15 seconds and we'll actually repeat
that<00:01:47.880> process<00:01:48.530> three<00:01:49.530> more<00:01:49.860> times<00:01:50.240> until<00:01:51.240> the

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
that process three more times until the

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.690 
that process three more times until the
chocolate<00:01:51.540> is<00:01:51.720> fully<00:01:52.140> melted<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:53.340> now<00:01:53.460> this<00:01:53.640> is

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
chocolate is fully melted so now this is

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.130 
chocolate is fully melted so now this is
the<00:01:53.820> fourth<00:01:54.150> time<00:01:54.300> that<00:01:54.630> your<00:01:54.750> chocolates

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
the fourth time that your chocolates

the fourth time that your chocolates
been<00:01:55.290> in<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.470> microwave<00:01:55.620> and<00:01:56.070> as<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.640> can<00:01:56.790> see

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
been in the microwave and as you can see

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.950 
been in the microwave and as you can see
it's<00:01:57.900> really<00:01:58.470> starting<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.180> that<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.420> perfect

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
it's really starting to that is perfect

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
easy way to counter that we're going to

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.830 
easy way to counter that we're going to
use<00:02:15.590> a<00:02:15.620> little<00:02:16.010> bit<00:02:16.130> of<00:02:16.250> vinegar<00:02:16.700> on<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.630> edge

of my cloth and we're going to clean out

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.550 
of my cloth and we're going to clean out
the<00:02:20.600> bowl<00:02:20.810> very<00:02:21.500> very<00:02:22.630> well<00:02:23.630> now<00:02:24.200> you<00:02:24.320> want<00:02:24.500> to

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
the bowl very very well now you want to

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.680 
the bowl very very well now you want to
make<00:02:25.160> sure<00:02:25.190> there's<00:02:25.640> no<00:02:25.760> one<00:02:26.090> bit<00:02:26.420> of<00:02:26.540> duck

left<00:02:26.930> inside<00:02:27.290> that<00:02:27.500> bow<00:02:27.680> what<00:02:28.340> that<00:02:28.520> does<00:02:28.790> is

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
left inside that bow what that does is

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.300 
left inside that bow what that does is
it'll<00:02:29.450> make<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.810> eggs<00:02:30.020> collapse<00:02:30.890> you're

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
it'll make the eggs collapse you're

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.760 
it'll make the eggs collapse you're
basically<00:02:31.940> getting<00:02:32.180> rid<00:02:32.510> of<00:02:32.690> all<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.530> police

that<00:02:34.040> might<00:02:34.220> be<00:02:34.430> in<00:02:34.550> there<00:02:34.780> so<00:02:35.780> once<00:02:35.960> that's

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
that might be in there so once that's

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.980 
that might be in there so once that's
done<00:02:36.410> we're<00:02:37.070> going<00:02:37.220> to<00:02:37.280> put<00:02:37.459> it<00:02:37.550> on<00:02:37.810> ready<00:02:38.810> to

whites and we're going to start them off
very<00:02:49.040> very<00:02:49.340> slowly<00:02:55.480> we're<00:02:56.480> going<00:02:56.600> to<00:02:56.660> add<00:02:56.750> a

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
very very slowly we're going to add a

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.449 
very very slowly we're going to add a
little<00:02:57.020> pinch<00:02:57.260> of<00:02:57.440> salt<00:02:57.620> in<00:02:57.860> here<00:02:57.980> guys<00:02:58.220> and

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
little pinch of salt in here guys and

little pinch of salt in here guys and
it's<00:02:58.700> get<00:02:59.360> into<00:02:59.600> a<00:02:59.630> very<00:03:00.020> crucial<00:03:00.350> stage<00:03:00.830> now

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
it's get into a very crucial stage now

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.580 
it's get into a very crucial stage now
you<00:03:02.090> can<00:03:02.239> see<00:03:02.390> the<00:03:02.540> egg<00:03:02.660> whites<00:03:02.930> starting<00:03:03.500> to

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
you can see the egg whites starting to

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.560 
you can see the egg whites starting to
rise<00:03:03.800> up<00:03:03.980> now<00:03:04.250> what<00:03:04.640> we<00:03:04.760> want<00:03:04.940> to<00:03:05.000> do<00:03:05.150> is<00:03:05.360> add

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
rise up now what we want to do is add

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.780 
rise up now what we want to do is add
our<00:03:05.600> sugar<00:03:06.020> in<00:03:06.290> very<00:03:06.770> very<00:03:07.130> slowly<00:03:07.520> we're

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
our sugar in very very slowly we're

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:19.730 
our sugar in very very slowly we're
going<00:03:07.910> to<00:03:07.970> sprinkle<00:03:08.360> a<00:03:08.660> little<00:03:08.780> bit<00:03:09.050> at<00:03:09.320> a<00:03:09.350> time

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.930 

and<00:03:20.220> it<00:03:20.340> don't<00:03:20.550> be<00:03:20.640> afraid<00:03:20.880> to<00:03:21.030> speed<00:03:21.330> it<00:03:21.450> up

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.979 

see<00:03:24.940> the<00:03:25.060> way<00:03:25.209> that<00:03:25.269> the<00:03:25.450> egg<00:03:25.569> whites<00:03:25.780> are

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
see the way that the egg whites are

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.720 
see the way that the egg whites are
really<00:03:26.349> starting<00:03:26.620> to<00:03:26.799> write<00:03:27.010> upside<00:03:27.519> it's

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
really starting to write upside it's

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.559 
really starting to write upside it's
really<00:03:28.120> it's<00:03:28.299> a<00:03:28.420> crucial<00:03:28.780> process<00:03:30.360> this<00:03:31.360> is

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
really it's a crucial process this is

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:33.180 
really it's a crucial process this is
what's<00:03:31.810> going<00:03:31.989> to<00:03:32.049> get<00:03:32.200> the<00:03:32.290> Moose<00:03:32.500> all<00:03:32.769> of<00:03:33.010> its

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
what's going to get the Moose all of its

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.979 
what's going to get the Moose all of its
lightness

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:44.050 

justify<00:03:37.920> that<00:03:38.250> sugar<00:03:38.670> nice<00:03:38.939> and<00:03:39.359> slowly

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.760 

-<00:03:44.600> the<00:03:44.720> way<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:44.959> egg<00:03:45.080> whites<00:03:45.290> are<00:03:45.410> really

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
- the way the egg whites are really

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:54.740 
- the way the egg whites are really
starting<00:03:46.040> to<00:03:46.190> multiply<00:03:46.880> in<00:03:47.000> volume

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.810 

that's<00:03:55.320> it<00:03:55.530> guys<00:03:55.740> that's<00:03:55.980> the<00:03:56.130> perfect<00:03:56.400> stage

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
that's it guys that's the perfect stage

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.040 
that's it guys that's the perfect stage
that<00:03:57.000> you're<00:03:57.150> looking<00:03:57.390> for<00:03:57.570> you<00:03:57.630> want<00:03:57.780> to<00:03:57.900> see
