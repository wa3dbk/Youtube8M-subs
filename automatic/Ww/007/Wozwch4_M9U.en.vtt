if<00:00:00.179> you<00:00:00.329> have<00:00:00.539> the<00:00:00.690> coppice<00:00:01.380> u101<00:00:02.330> that<00:00:03.330> will

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
if you have the coppice u101 that will

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.559 
if you have the coppice u101 that will
be<00:00:03.659> for<00:00:03.899> the<00:00:04.020> mass<00:00:04.230> airflow<00:00:04.500> sensor<00:00:05.299> the<00:00:06.299> first

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
be for the mass airflow sensor the first

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.390 
be for the mass airflow sensor the first
thing<00:00:06.750> you<00:00:06.870> have<00:00:07.049> to<00:00:07.290> do<00:00:07.410> is<00:00:07.560> locate<00:00:07.799> your<00:00:08.189> mass

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
thing you have to do is locate your mass

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.490 
thing you have to do is locate your mass
airflow<00:00:08.670> sensor<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.480> this<00:00:09.840> car<00:00:10.110> is<00:00:10.260> right

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
airflow sensor and this car is right

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.339 
airflow sensor and this car is right
here<00:00:11.120> right<00:00:12.120> with<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.389> intake<00:00:12.840> is<00:00:13.049> it's

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
here right with the intake is it's

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.980 
here right with the intake is it's
always<00:00:13.530> wobbly<00:00:13.950> by<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.190> intake<00:00:14.700> so<00:00:15.630> this<00:00:15.839> is

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
always wobbly by the intake so this is

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.630 
always wobbly by the intake so this is
the<00:00:16.080> mass<00:00:16.289> airflow<00:00:16.500> sensor<00:00:16.680> right<00:00:17.160> here<00:00:17.220> it's

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
the mass airflow sensor right here it's

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.880 
the mass airflow sensor right here it's
something<00:00:18.000> really<00:00:18.270> easy<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.810> do<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.439> I<00:00:19.590> really

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
something really easy to do and I really

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.779 
something really easy to do and I really
recommend<00:00:20.010> for<00:00:20.369> you<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.760> do<00:00:20.880> you<00:00:21.090> know<00:00:21.410> every

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
recommend for you to do you know every

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.939 
recommend for you to do you know every
six<00:00:23.789> months<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:25.140> can<00:00:25.350> keep<00:00:25.560> your<00:00:25.740> car

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
six months so you can keep your car

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.370 
six months so you can keep your car
running<00:00:26.220> good<00:00:26.630> the<00:00:27.630> only<00:00:27.869> thing<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.170> have<00:00:28.349> to

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
running good the only thing you have to

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:57.410 
running good the only thing you have to
do<00:00:29.029> just<00:00:32.960> take<00:00:33.960> this<00:00:34.140> little<00:00:34.410> ball<00:00:34.649> up

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.759 

now<00:00:58.420> to<00:00:58.480> unplug<00:00:58.960> the<00:00:59.110> mass<00:00:59.320> airflow<00:00:59.559> sensor

00:00:59.759 --> 00:00:59.769 
now to unplug the mass airflow sensor

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:12.620 
now to unplug the mass airflow sensor
just<00:01:00.280> push<00:01:00.790> this<00:01:01.000> little<00:01:01.650> thing<00:01:02.650> right<00:01:02.680> here

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
you're going to have a check engine

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.990 
you're going to have a check engine
light<00:01:22.479> with<00:01:22.960> a<00:01:22.990> coal<00:01:23.430> for<00:01:24.430> the<00:01:24.520> mass<00:01:24.759> airflow

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
light with a coal for the mass airflow

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.109 
light with a coal for the mass airflow
sensor<00:01:25.800> and<00:01:26.800> you<00:01:26.860> think<00:01:27.250> you<00:01:27.369> need<00:01:27.520> to<00:01:27.550> replace

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
sensor and you think you need to replace

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.919 
sensor and you think you need to replace
it<00:01:28.390> but<00:01:29.380> you<00:01:29.530> only<00:01:29.679> have<00:01:29.950> to<00:01:30.100> clean<00:01:30.369> it<00:01:30.520> and<00:01:31.270> to
