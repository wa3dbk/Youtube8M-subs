00:00:03.539 --> 00:00:07.740
 pass the bridge part of the 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.170
 incursion end of crota through 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.690
 a trick like many you ask me yesterday and 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.870
 well here I bring it to you so sometimes 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.400
 the likes in thanks to this 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.960
 trick that I'm going to teach you 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.090
 continuation but good first thing 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.100
 I'm going to do in this in this video is 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.860
 teach us how the trick I saw you yesterday 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.510
 after the update continues 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.310
 working the trick for you to pass 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.800
 you alone right now here you have 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.750
 I've seen that the lamp has not 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.760
 thrown anywhere with this I want 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.600
 show you what I played in after the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.910
 update and it's good that you can 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.030
 do some you decide that you could not 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.159
 with the titan or with a sorcerer you can 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.199
 you have to use the elevation 

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:51.629
 this is that I do not know if it's called elevation 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:54.239
 it's not called plan it's good you have to 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.429
 use the jump most similar to the jump 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.670
 that I have in the video and you are going to get 

00:00:56.429 --> 00:01:02.579
 because I arrived without problems and not 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.080
 you will get to the first one obviously you can 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.820
 Do not get to the first one if you come to 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.190
 the first one looks well 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.930
 keep trying but I here you 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.960
 I show that you can get there 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.060
 saying this I'm going to start when you see 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.820
 this I'm going to start and talk about the 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.740
 trick that I bring for the bridge this 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.680
 trick can only be used by 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.330
 titans and sorcerers again so 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.300
 that the hunters for good we have 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.369
 to endure and good tomorrow I'll upload a 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.160
 trick so you can pass this area 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.900
 with your team and take advantage 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.340
 also the hunters since they can not 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.869
 take advantage of this trick to do it 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.090
 I alone what we have to do to 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.680
 do this trick is activate the bridge and 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.800
 go to the room from where the 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.930
 carry swords as you are watching and what 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.880
 what we are going to achieve is that 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.530
 disappear all the enemies of this 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.140
 map area except for the portal 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.020
 swords and enemies start coming 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.759
 on the other side of the bridge that happens that 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.530
 if we do not do anything else and we start 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.270
 kill the enemies from this side of the 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.690
 bridge at the moment that the 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.240
 ogres 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.399
 let's die for the tottenham and kill 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.679
 Ador to be activated on the other side 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.269
 of the bridge then to avoid this 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:10.729
 What we have to do is 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:12.379
 cross the bridge 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.760
 we are going to cross the bridge because we kill the 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.620
 carry swords as you are seeing here 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.030
 I'm killing the sword holder not 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.459
 we are in a hurry if they come because we 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.590
 we answer here back the portal is for 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.629
 regular then there is no hurry in 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.280
 kill sword holders and once you 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.560
 we killed the sword swordsman 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.049
 we stole the sword and what we have to 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.209
 to do is to go to this stone that is the 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:35.090
 largest stone in this area and 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.500
 once we are here 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.840
 I already tell you with the sorcerer or the 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.299
 titan what we have to do is jump 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.940
 towards the bridge and once we are what 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.799
 highest possible we have to use the 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.980
 sword to come to the lane of 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:50.780
 bridge and cross the bridge if we do not cross 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.609
 by the bridge lane we are not going to 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.400
 to be able to cross because they 're going to kill us 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:57.049
 half the way so what 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.000
 we have to do is cross over that 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.920
 path is along the path of the bridge 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.569
 as you have seen or nothing once 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.030
 we are here in the only thing we will have 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.129
 what to do would be to put up with each one as 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.629
 may is as taught in the previous 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:10.250
 video kill the ogres and once you 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:12.620
 kill the others as the 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.540
 phase so nothing that's all I hope that 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.560
 you liked the video thank you very much 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.640
