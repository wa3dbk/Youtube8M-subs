00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
why I'm doing them is just for a

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.660 
why I'm doing them is just for a
possible<00:02:28.560> collection<00:02:29.069> with<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.310> reward

cards they release the mid-season fancy

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.710 
cards they release the mid-season fancy
cards<00:02:32.549> so<00:02:32.670> that<00:02:32.700> leads<00:02:33.000> me<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.330> believe<00:02:33.360> that

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
cards so that leads me to believe that

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.119 
cards so that leads me to believe that
they<00:02:33.840> won't<00:02:33.989> have<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.290> fancy<00:02:34.620> reward

collection at all but they could prove

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.589 
collection at all but they could prove
