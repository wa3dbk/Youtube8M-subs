service it's a fantastic opportunity for

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.360 
service it's a fantastic opportunity for
European<00:00:43.140> firefighters<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.890> get<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.220> know

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
European firefighters to get to know

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.130 
European firefighters to get to know
each<00:00:44.400> other<00:00:44.790> and<00:00:45.090> how<00:00:45.420> they<00:00:45.629> work<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:46.050> their

respective countries whilst learning our

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.790 
respective countries whilst learning our
techniques<00:00:49.910> due<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.150> the<00:00:51.330> risks<00:00:52.290> that<00:00:52.350> we<00:00:52.680> have

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
techniques due to the risks that we have

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.580 
techniques due to the risks that we have
like<00:00:53.040> for<00:00:53.640> example<00:00:53.730> cryogenics<00:00:54.600> risks<00:00:55.170> and

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
like for example cryogenics risks and

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.920 
like for example cryogenics risks and
also<00:00:55.769> the<00:00:56.040> complexity<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.970> sites<00:00:57.330> here<00:00:57.720> so

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
also the complexity of the sites here so

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.700 
also the complexity of the sites here so
we<00:00:58.110> should<00:00:58.440> know<00:00:58.650> our<00:00:59.690> environment<00:01:00.710> buildings

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
we should know our environment buildings

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.830 
we should know our environment buildings
specific<00:01:02.670> grids<00:01:02.880> of<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.120> buildings<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:03.719> it's

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
specific grids of the buildings so it's

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.770 
specific grids of the buildings so it's
a<00:01:03.899> big<00:01:04.110> knowledge<00:01:04.410> that<00:01:04.739> we<00:01:04.860> have<00:01:05.009> to<00:01:05.630> to<00:01:06.630> learn

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
a big knowledge that we have to to learn

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.070 
a big knowledge that we have to to learn
in<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.080> short<00:01:07.530> period<00:01:08.119> we<00:01:09.119> also<00:01:09.240> have<00:01:09.690> to<00:01:09.899> work

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
in a short period we also have to work

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.740 
in a short period we also have to work
in<00:01:10.350> them<00:01:10.500> in<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.430> different<00:01:11.759> way<00:01:11.940> I<00:01:12.210> mean<00:01:12.600> like

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
in them in a different way I mean like

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.740 
in them in a different way I mean like
if<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.380> work<00:01:13.500> in<00:01:13.649> a<00:01:14.149> normal<00:01:15.149> station<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.720> have

if you work in a normal station you have

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.690 
if you work in a normal station you have
to<00:01:15.990> work<00:01:16.140> in<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.470> reaction<00:01:16.800> here<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.460> have<00:01:17.550> to

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
to work in a reaction here you have to

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.820 
to work in a reaction here you have to
work<00:01:17.850> before<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.869> events<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.410> we<00:01:19.440> are<00:01:19.710> doing
