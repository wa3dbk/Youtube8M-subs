today we're gonna talk about handling

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.840 
today we're gonna talk about handling
crack<00:00:27.490> injections<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.740> to<00:00:30.040> start<00:00:30.250> with<00:00:30.460> we're

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:30.850 
crack injections and to start with we're

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.700 
crack injections and to start with we're
gonna<00:00:30.940> show<00:00:31.480> you<00:00:31.540> how<00:00:31.660> to<00:00:31.720> apply<00:00:31.900> our<00:00:32.230> surface

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
gonna show you how to apply our surface

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.790 
gonna show you how to apply our surface
seal<00:00:32.950> by<00:00:33.820> using<00:00:34.090> a<00:00:34.300> nozzle<00:00:34.510> make<00:00:35.470> sure<00:00:35.650> you

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
seal by using a nozzle make sure you

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.590 
seal by using a nozzle make sure you
break<00:00:36.070> off<00:00:36.310> the<00:00:36.490> end<00:00:36.610> of<00:00:36.700> the<00:00:36.790> nozzle<00:00:37.000> and<00:00:37.480> what

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
break off the end of the nozzle and what

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.000 
break off the end of the nozzle and what
this<00:00:37.720> is<00:00:37.870> gonna<00:00:37.990> do<00:00:38.230> for<00:00:38.260> us<00:00:38.620> it's<00:00:38.800> gonna

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
this is gonna do for us it's gonna

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.340 
this is gonna do for us it's gonna
create<00:00:39.820> speed<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:42.430> use<00:00:42.580> less<00:00:42.790> product<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:44.230> we

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
create speed and use less product so we

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.670 
create speed and use less product so we
attach<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:46.300> nozzle<00:00:46.750> to<00:00:46.989> the<00:00:47.110> end<00:00:47.230> of<00:00:47.350> our<00:00:47.440> dual

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
attach the nozzle to the end of our dual

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.460 
attach the nozzle to the end of our dual
cartridge<00:00:48.220> with<00:00:48.430> the<00:00:48.460> paste<00:00:48.760> in<00:00:48.970> there<00:00:49.470> it's

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
cartridge with the paste in there it's

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:51.780

wall you want to be able to see the

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.760 
wall you want to be able to see the
crack<00:01:13.060> through<00:01:13.300> the<00:01:13.390> port<00:01:13.630> so<00:01:14.200> do<00:01:14.350> not<00:01:14.470> block

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
crack through the port so do not block

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.460 
crack through the port so do not block
the<00:01:14.920> bottom<00:01:15.360> in<00:01:16.360> the<00:01:16.750> picture<00:01:16.990> we<00:01:17.080> started<00:01:17.380> at

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
the bottom in the picture we started at

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.050 
the bottom in the picture we started at
the<00:01:17.560> top<00:01:17.800> you<00:01:18.010> can<00:01:18.040> also<00:01:18.280> start<00:01:18.640> at<00:01:18.790> the<00:01:18.909> bottom

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
the top you can also start at the bottom

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.170 
the top you can also start at the bottom
so<00:01:19.990> that<00:01:20.020> the<00:01:20.140> bottom<00:01:20.530> product<00:01:20.800> is<00:01:21.130> set<00:01:21.909> on<00:01:22.030> the

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
so that the bottom product is set on the

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.090 
so that the bottom product is set on the
wall<00:01:22.330> longer<00:01:22.780> either<00:01:23.020> way<00:01:23.260> it's<00:01:23.770> gonna<00:01:23.890> take

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
wall longer either way it's gonna take

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.560 
wall longer either way it's gonna take
about<00:01:24.190> five<00:01:24.520> minutes<00:01:24.550> to<00:01:24.940> do<00:01:25.090> this<00:01:25.270> so<00:01:25.450> it

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
about five minutes to do this so it

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:26.780 
about five minutes to do this so it
doesn't<00:01:25.750> really<00:01:25.960> matter<00:01:26.170> all<00:01:26.290> that<00:01:26.409> much

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
doesn't really matter all that much

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.890 
doesn't really matter all that much
you'll<00:01:27.790> start<00:01:27.970> your<00:01:28.240> injection<00:01:28.690> at<00:01:28.810> the

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
you'll start your injection at the

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.350 
you'll start your injection at the
bottom<00:01:29.230> that's<00:01:29.410> just<00:01:29.680> why<00:01:29.800> we<00:01:30.010> mention<00:01:30.370> it<00:01:30.520> but

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
bottom that's just why we mention it but

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.090 
bottom that's just why we mention it but
a<00:01:31.390> nice<00:01:31.600> bead<00:01:32.020> it's<00:01:32.470> about<00:01:32.620> a<00:01:32.650> quarter-inch

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
a nice bead it's about a quarter-inch

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.740 
a nice bead it's about a quarter-inch
bead<00:01:33.520> on<00:01:33.790> the<00:01:33.970> wall<00:01:34.120> just<00:01:34.360> like<00:01:34.450> you<00:01:34.660> were

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
bead on the wall just like you were

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.220 
bead on the wall just like you were
caulking<00:01:35.200> a<00:01:35.260> window<00:01:35.620> or<00:01:35.800> something<00:01:35.950> like<00:01:36.220> that

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:37.230 
caulking a window or something like that

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.660 
caulking a window or something like that
if<00:01:38.230> you<00:01:38.380> plan<00:01:38.590> on<00:01:38.740> peeling<00:01:39.010> this<00:01:39.220> off<00:01:39.400> later

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
if you plan on peeling this off later

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.060 
if you plan on peeling this off later
it's<00:01:39.910> important<00:01:40.360> to<00:01:40.480> leave<00:01:40.660> a<00:01:41.020> decent<00:01:42.010> amount

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
it's important to leave a decent amount

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.010 
it's important to leave a decent amount
of<00:01:42.280> material<00:01:42.760> on<00:01:43.000> the<00:01:43.180> wall<00:01:43.360> so<00:01:43.810> you<00:01:43.870> can

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
of material on the wall so you can

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.230 
of material on the wall so you can
create<00:01:44.440> a<00:01:44.470> nice<00:01:44.650> piece<00:01:45.010> of<00:01:45.160> rope<00:01:45.520> to<00:01:45.550> pull<00:01:46.060> off

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
create a nice piece of rope to pull off

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.050 
create a nice piece of rope to pull off
when<00:01:46.540> we're<00:01:46.690> done<00:01:47.280> we'll<00:01:48.280> stop<00:01:48.490> about<00:01:48.790> every

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
when we're done we'll stop about every

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.510 
when we're done we'll stop about every
two<00:01:49.300> feet<00:01:49.330> and<00:01:49.780> slightly<00:01:50.620> press<00:01:51.040> the<00:01:51.250> product

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
two feet and slightly press the product

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.750 
two feet and slightly press the product
into<00:01:52.360> the<00:01:52.450> wall<00:01:52.630> and<00:01:52.870> around<00:01:53.140> the<00:01:53.320> ports<00:01:53.760> you

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
into the wall and around the ports you

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.130 
into the wall and around the ports you
do<00:01:54.910> not<00:01:55.060> want<00:01:55.330> to<00:01:55.420> let<00:01:55.570> ever<00:01:55.780> seal

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
do not want to let ever seal

sit<00:01:57.790> in<00:01:57.970> the<00:01:58.090> nozzle<00:01:58.330> too<00:01:58.720> long<00:02:00.630> because<00:02:01.630> it

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
sit in the nozzle too long because it

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.780 
sit in the nozzle too long because it
will<00:02:02.170> start<00:02:02.500> to<00:02:02.590> gel<00:02:02.800> up<00:02:02.980> and<00:02:03.250> then<00:02:03.400> at<00:02:03.580> some

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
will start to gel up and then at some

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.340 
will start to gel up and then at some
point<00:02:03.820> you'll<00:02:04.180> have<00:02:04.210> to<00:02:04.480> put<00:02:04.630> a<00:02:04.660> new<00:02:04.810> nozzle<00:02:04.990> on

there<00:02:05.610> so<00:02:06.610> we<00:02:06.700> spread<00:02:06.940> it<00:02:06.970> around<00:02:07.180> the<00:02:07.420> ports

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
there so we spread it around the ports

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.119 
there so we spread it around the ports
down<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:09.099> wall<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:11.440> make<00:02:11.650> sure<00:02:11.769> we<00:02:11.890> cover<00:02:12.069> all

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:12.129 
down the wall and make sure we cover all

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:14.850 
down the wall and make sure we cover all
the<00:02:12.310> crack<00:02:12.550> Hey<00:02:13.180> pay<00:02:13.780> close<00:02:13.989> attention<00:02:14.140> to<00:02:14.530> the

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
the crack Hey pay close attention to the

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.030 
the crack Hey pay close attention to the
crack<00:02:15.099> sometimes<00:02:15.670> they<00:02:15.940> do<00:02:16.000> split<00:02:16.810> off<00:02:17.040> in

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
crack sometimes they do split off in

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.650 
crack sometimes they do split off in
different<00:02:18.250> directions<00:02:18.489> and<00:02:19.090> then<00:02:19.239> come<00:02:19.450> back

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
different directions and then come back

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.330 
different directions and then come back
together<00:02:19.870> again<00:02:20.379> like<00:02:20.560> a<00:02:20.620> fork<00:02:20.950> in<00:02:21.099> the<00:02:21.190> road

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
together again like a fork in the road

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.860 
together again like a fork in the road
and<00:02:21.580> we'll<00:02:21.670> want<00:02:21.849> to<00:02:21.910> cover<00:02:22.090> both<00:02:22.360> sides<00:02:22.420> of

and we'll want to cover both sides of

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.509 
and we'll want to cover both sides of
that<00:02:22.900> fork<00:02:25.050> as<00:02:26.050> you<00:02:26.290> notice<00:02:26.620> we're<00:02:27.220> applying

that fork as you notice we're applying

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.610 
that fork as you notice we're applying
the<00:02:27.670> product<00:02:28.000> liberally<00:02:28.599> around<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.290> ports

for it so we'll make sure to put plenty
of<00:02:40.800> material<00:02:41.310> around<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.700> ports<00:02:42.170> and<00:02:43.170> you'll

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
of material around the ports and you'll

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.080 
of material around the ports and you'll
see<00:02:43.530> in<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.739> video<00:02:43.830> we'll<00:02:44.430> come<00:02:44.580> back<00:02:44.790> again

later<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:46.400> apply<00:02:47.400> it<00:02:47.459> around<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:47.760> ports

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
later and apply it around the ports

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:55.309 
later and apply it around the ports
again<00:02:52.580> this<00:02:53.580> whole<00:02:53.909> process<00:02:54.180> again<00:02:54.659> will<00:02:55.049> take

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
again this whole process again will take

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.809 
again this whole process again will take
about<00:02:55.500> five<00:02:55.950> minutes<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.489> do<00:02:56.730> this<00:02:57.500> and<00:02:58.819> there

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
about five minutes to do this and there

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.059 
about five minutes to do this and there
you<00:03:00.150> can<00:03:00.269> see<00:03:00.330> how<00:03:00.780> that<00:03:01.080> crack<00:03:01.560> has<00:03:01.769> split

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
you can see how that crack has split

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.869 
you can see how that crack has split
into<00:03:02.280> two<00:03:02.549> directions<00:03:04.489> if<00:03:05.489> you<00:03:05.670> have<00:03:05.849> a

the majority and water problems are then

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.370 
the majority and water problems are then
we<00:06:09.060> work<00:06:09.210> up<00:06:09.390> the<00:06:09.480> wall<00:06:09.660> nice<00:06:09.870> and<00:06:10.080> easy<00:06:10.200> this

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 
we work up the wall nice and easy this

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:11.750 
we work up the wall nice and easy this
takes<00:06:10.590> about<00:06:10.710> five<00:06:10.980> or<00:06:11.160> ten<00:06:11.310> minutes<00:06:11.610> this

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.760 
takes about five or ten minutes this

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.270 
takes about five or ten minutes this
foam<00:06:12.000> is<00:06:12.210> very<00:06:12.270> very<00:06:12.780> thin<00:06:13.110> so<00:06:13.890> you<00:06:13.920> won't<00:06:14.160> have

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 
foam is very very thin so you won't have

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.530 
foam is very very thin so you won't have
a<00:06:14.340> lot<00:06:14.490> of<00:06:14.520> bracket<00:06:14.910> pressure<00:06:15.150> you<00:06:15.390> won't

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:15.540 
a lot of bracket pressure you won't

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.800 
a lot of bracket pressure you won't
experience<00:06:15.750> a<00:06:15.990> lot<00:06:16.140> of<00:06:16.230> blowouts<00:06:17.600> you'll<00:06:18.600> just

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
experience a lot of blowouts you'll just

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.960 
experience a lot of blowouts you'll just
have<00:06:18.990> a<00:06:19.020> much<00:06:19.740> better<00:06:19.890> experience<00:06:20.130> using<00:06:20.790> a

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:20.970 
have a much better experience using a

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:30.279 
have a much better experience using a
thinner<00:06:21.180> foam

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:30.289 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:32.529 

it<00:06:30.830> also<00:06:31.009> won't<00:06:31.279> react<00:06:31.699> aggressively<00:06:32.360> to<00:06:32.509> the

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:32.539 
it also won't react aggressively to the

it also won't react aggressively to the
air<00:06:32.869> itself<00:06:33.409> so<00:06:33.710> once<00:06:33.889> we<00:06:34.039> go<00:06:34.189> to<00:06:35.080> surface

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080

00:06:38.559 --> 00:06:38.569 
paced off at the end you're not gonna

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:39.909 
paced off at the end you're not gonna
have<00:06:38.779> a<00:06:38.809> lot<00:06:38.960> of<00:06:38.990> bubbling<00:06:39.379> in<00:06:39.529> the<00:06:39.649> crack

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:39.919 
have a lot of bubbling in the crack

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:41.619 
have a lot of bubbling in the crack
coming<00:06:40.520> back<00:06:40.669> out<00:06:40.879> at<00:06:41.059> you're<00:06:41.210> creating

00:06:41.619 --> 00:06:41.629 
coming back out at you're creating

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:43.480 
coming back out at you're creating
additional<00:06:41.899> mess<00:06:42.409> it's<00:06:43.039> gonna<00:06:43.219> look<00:06:43.430> very

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:43.490 
additional mess it's gonna look very

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.689 
additional mess it's gonna look very
clean<00:06:44.589> there<00:06:45.589> it<00:06:45.710> is<00:06:45.800> when<00:06:45.949> it's<00:06:46.069> complete<00:06:46.460> you

00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:46.699 
clean there it is when it's complete you

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:48.279 
clean there it is when it's complete you
can<00:06:46.729> see<00:06:46.939> trace<00:06:47.180> amounts<00:06:47.539> of<00:06:47.659> foam<00:06:47.869> coming<00:06:48.110> out

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:48.289 
can see trace amounts of foam coming out

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:50.379 
can see trace amounts of foam coming out
of<00:06:48.349> the<00:06:48.409> wall<00:06:48.669> and<00:06:49.669> then<00:06:49.819> we<00:06:49.879> just<00:06:49.999> pull<00:06:50.149> it<00:06:50.240> off

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:50.389 
of the wall and then we just pull it off

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:51.850 
of the wall and then we just pull it off
you<00:06:50.749> can<00:06:50.899> use<00:06:50.930> a<00:06:51.050> trowel<00:06:51.349> it<00:06:51.559> makes<00:06:51.710> it<00:06:51.830> a

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:51.860 
you can use a trowel it makes it a

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.589 
you can use a trowel it makes it a
little<00:06:52.039> easier<00:06:52.339> here<00:06:52.399> we<00:06:52.699> just<00:06:52.819> pull<00:06:53.389> it<00:06:53.479> off

00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:53.599 
little easier here we just pull it off

00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:56.139 
little easier here we just pull it off
by<00:06:53.779> hand<00:06:54.110> and<00:06:54.740> you'll<00:06:54.919> see<00:06:55.099> a<00:06:55.129> lot<00:06:55.580> of<00:06:55.610> the<00:06:55.879> foam

00:06:56.139 --> 00:06:56.149 
by hand and you'll see a lot of the foam

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:59.950 
by hand and you'll see a lot of the foam
will<00:06:56.300> come<00:06:56.479> off<00:06:56.629> with<00:06:57.099> the<00:06:58.099> surface<00:06:58.520> seal<00:06:58.960> you

00:06:59.950 --> 00:06:59.960 
will come off with the surface seal you

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.839 
will come off with the surface seal you
can<00:07:00.050> come<00:07:00.319> back<00:07:00.499> later<00:07:00.800> and<00:07:00.979> or<00:07:01.580> not<00:07:01.669> even

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:01.849 
can come back later and or not even

00:07:04.269 --> 00:07:04.279 
surface seal off you can come back with

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:05.739 
surface seal off you can come back with
a<00:07:04.339> little<00:07:04.520> trial<00:07:04.759> and<00:07:04.909> scrape<00:07:05.149> that<00:07:05.300> foam<00:07:05.539> off

00:07:05.739 --> 00:07:05.749 
a little trial and scrape that foam off

00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:08.469 
a little trial and scrape that foam off
it's<00:07:06.020> it's<00:07:06.949> got<00:07:07.189> its<00:07:07.339> initial<00:07:07.729> set<00:07:07.999> so<00:07:08.270> we'll

00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:08.479 
it's it's got its initial set so we'll

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:11.320 
it's it's got its initial set so we'll
not<00:07:08.689> make<00:07:08.839> a<00:07:08.869> mess<00:07:09.169> you<00:07:09.520> can<00:07:10.520> use<00:07:10.699> up<00:07:10.939> sell<00:07:11.180> this
