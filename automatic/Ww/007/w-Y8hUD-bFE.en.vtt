six ounces but again now you're seeing
all<00:00:52.260> this<00:00:52.559> beautiful<00:00:52.829> carbon<00:00:53.250> fiber<00:00:53.460> exposed

all this beautiful carbon fiber exposed

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.880 
all this beautiful carbon fiber exposed
it<00:00:54.270> really<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.719> lot<00:00:54.930> it's<00:00:55.110> actually<00:00:55.260> more

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
it really is a lot it's actually more

carbon fiber on the exterior here than a

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.569 
carbon fiber on the exterior here than a
race<00:00:57.750> our<00:00:57.989> Pro<00:00:58.379> carbon<00:00:58.859> which<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.370> nice

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
race our Pro carbon which is a nice

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.099 
race our Pro carbon which is a nice
touch<00:00:59.820> and<00:00:59.969> remember<00:01:00.449> this<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.750> kind<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:01.020> the

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
touch and remember this is kind of the

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.930 
touch and remember this is kind of the
in-betweener<00:01:01.710> helmet<00:01:02.100> from<00:01:02.250> shark<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.820> when

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
in-betweener helmet from shark and when

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.030 
in-betweener helmet from shark and when
I<00:01:02.969> say<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.390> it's<00:01:03.600> aggressive<00:01:04.409> its<00:01:04.619> sport

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
I say that it's aggressive its sport

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.380 
I say that it's aggressive its sport
oriented<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.460> could<00:01:05.580> probably<00:01:05.820> take<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.270> the

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
oriented you could probably take to the

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.060 
oriented you could probably take to the
track<00:01:06.630> but<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.080> nice<00:01:07.200> part<00:01:07.229> about<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:07.830> it's

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
track but the nice part about it is it's

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.560 
track but the nice part about it is it's
got<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.250> drop-down<00:01:08.640> Sun<00:01:08.880> Visor<00:01:09.090> which<00:01:09.299> I<00:01:09.390> just

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
got a drop-down Sun Visor which I just

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.700 
got a drop-down Sun Visor which I just
shot<00:01:09.750> down<00:01:09.780> here<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.200> can<00:01:10.320> see<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.560> on<00:01:10.650> the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
shot down here you can see it on the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.530 
shot down here you can see it on the
inside<00:01:10.830> here<00:01:11.189> notice<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.880> slides<00:01:12.180> along<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
inside here notice it slides along the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.390 
inside here notice it slides along the
top<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.869> still<00:01:13.049> comes<00:01:13.229> with<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.380> pack<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.860> max

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
top it still comes with a pack a max

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.550 
top it still comes with a pack a max

gonna see it's kind of a little bit of a
domino<00:02:06.149> pattern<00:02:06.509> here<00:02:06.719> but<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.140> way<00:02:07.290> that

domino pattern here but the way that

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.779 
domino pattern here but the way that
they<00:02:07.560> did<00:02:07.619> this<00:02:07.860> was<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.190> be<00:02:08.310> very<00:02:08.520> subtle

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
they did this was to be very subtle
