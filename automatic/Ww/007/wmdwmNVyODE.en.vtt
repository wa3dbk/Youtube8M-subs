00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.220
 they do it 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.150
 we are a great honor for a very special promotion 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.150
 a second choice among the participants is going to put a tattoo today 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.169
 this has been a disappointing number for a long time 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:17.890
 places including 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.970
 want to avoid hundreds of fans and more importantly 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.449
 The main problem was put more and more motivated with theater 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.699
 get busy 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:27.239
 and we're going to drop it off 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:29.779
 it's a switch that wants to work 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.189
 also denmark 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:32.119
 no not at all 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.620
 2 0 behind either 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.820
 not at all it was actually a bet 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.910
 at the beginning 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.000
 that actually counts I have to the case anyway 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.640
 and who will not contribute 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.960
 to the presidents in May 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.370
 a tattoo seems to be nervous at the thought year not 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.760
 no I have no problems at all 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.750
 yes the pain naturally makes a little bit yes 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.830
 I'm sure 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.480
 but why then you can actually see if you can win well 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.839
 well i have rarely got such a weekend 89 light years 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:03.360
 and of which twice in the final 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.420
 and the last few years with his toes the scans are just there to be years 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.440
 about a possible to propose and have been in the media 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.830
 it was yes so much commotion to change a part of the city and dare 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.870
 our great poor people transferred a tattoo then why exactly there 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.870
 and i do like art for my life contributed that art is it 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.340
 It is important to be in charge through the arts training and almost daily 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.740
 busy with 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.320
 if there is nothing more to do then you think 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.680
 no I already have one and it is pretty easy to estimate 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.220
 life came 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.220
 it is to make a ball but to release the teeth bite 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.280
 yes I wish you good luck yes thank you 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.729

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.580
