00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.180
 We'll close it to make the sangria.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:33.390
 smell of ink room sign ink is 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.890
 full for the mouth for up going out 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.890
 all the air will be filled with paint 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.520
 do not leak to care much 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.680
 ink and always leave a paper towel 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.680
 hand toilet paper to be able to do 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:17.130
 cecat between not doing foliage of 2010 goes 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.799
 have to do it again to close 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.799
 well to fill the cartridge 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.880
 You're asking 'but if it's so beautiful, it's empty. 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:43.360
 goes down and goes up the paint to 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.360
 the cartridge 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.790
 now if the body is full 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.280
 just see how many also arrive too 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.780

 he goes diving already leaving a little 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.400
 because it already had original ink 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.110

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.650
 compatible with the inks that people

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.450
 will be done on all the 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.790
 cartridges and so on 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:23.180

 can see the black and it takes a little bit 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:38.490
 more because it 's a bigger field it goes in 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.160
 about 40 ml of ink inside 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:44.970
 already the colored it goes around 16 m 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:47.820

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:50.270
 syringe there so he could bleed 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.270
 well your team

 we use the room the bulls in 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.760
 original chapters because only in the 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.930
 original print cartridge that 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.710
 can do the cleaning system 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:15.070
 automatically on compatible corners and 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:17.950
 system does not work can do as many 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:19.450
 Sometimes they will always stay 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:23.610
 speaking impression you're going to have to do 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:23.610
 a manual bleed back the cartridges 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:30.850
 doing the cleaning solves most of the 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:32.800
 problems with using the cartridge 

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:34.750
 original and we are coming to the printer 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.290
 made if the original was not to 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.290
 problems 

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:52.270
