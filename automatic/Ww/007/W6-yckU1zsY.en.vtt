00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:22.670 
earlier videos I think I've only had one

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:25.720 
earlier videos I think I've only had one
or<00:07:22.790> two<00:07:22.820> videos<00:07:23.240> of<00:07:23.390> that<00:07:23.510> sled<00:07:23.980> but<00:07:24.980> it's<00:07:25.130> a<00:07:25.280> 70

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:25.730 
or two videos of that sled but it's a 70

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:29.320 
or two videos of that sled but it's a 70
60<00:07:26.300> X<00:07:26.510> 340<00:07:27.320> and<00:07:27.890> I've<00:07:28.520> worked<00:07:28.880> it<00:07:29.030> over<00:07:29.270> a

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:29.330 
60 X 340 and I've worked it over a

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.300 
60 X 340 and I've worked it over a
little<00:07:29.450> bit<00:07:29.660> it<00:07:29.840> feels<00:07:30.050> like<00:07:30.320> more<00:07:30.560> than<00:07:30.710> 340

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:31.310 
little bit it feels like more than 340

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:33.850 
little bit it feels like more than 340
and<00:07:31.340> so<00:07:31.550> I<00:07:31.580> don't<00:07:31.850> know<00:07:32.030> if<00:07:32.240> it's<00:07:32.420> a<00:07:32.540> 440<00:07:33.110> or<00:07:33.230> 340

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:33.860 
and so I don't know if it's a 440 or 340

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:37.990 
and so I don't know if it's a 440 or 340
I<00:07:34.420> didn't<00:07:35.420> have<00:07:35.540> the<00:07:35.720> sled<00:07:35.990> knew<00:07:36.200> it<00:07:36.410> was<00:07:37.000> some

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.000 
I didn't have the sled knew it was some

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.890 
I didn't have the sled knew it was some
hired<00:07:38.180> hands<00:07:38.480> and<00:07:38.750> left<00:07:38.960> it<00:07:39.110> here<00:07:39.350> and<00:07:39.580> I<00:07:40.900> just

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:41.900 
hired hands and left it here and I just

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.890 
hired hands and left it here and I just
