00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.960
 of this type in europe 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:17.050

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.950

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:23.500

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:46.479
 eating hard iron and silver can not 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.729
 tell us something about your career now 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.490
 I'm preparing for the first show that 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:54.729
 You know, I have not done in a half years 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.280
 year and a half if then better prepared

 our fans who want to stay in 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.970
 form in dedication form please 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:16.270
 as long as it is fixed and in gyms 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:19.360
 to me the example that I can tell you is 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.750
 that when you no longer want to go for the 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.750
 fitness center 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.790
 you have to devote more to the discipline 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.320
 there is nothing else that is the discipline not 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.930
 only for the gym but for 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.590

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.640

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.739
 light piece I like but a dumb 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.680
 very cold also with nutrition 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:59.040
 eating lots of healthy calories 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.489
 calories and not even 300 grams of 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.280
 daily proteins and a weight that 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.560
 can handle and not so heavy that what 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.750
 who will see in the gym a weight that 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.430
 can control whether it's the minimum 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.430
 from 10 to 15 repetitions 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.120
