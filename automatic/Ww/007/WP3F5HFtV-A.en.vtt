over<00:03:40.350> here<00:03:40.620> so<00:03:40.920> do<00:03:41.040> your<00:03:41.190> bottom<00:03:41.519> one<00:03:41.670> first<00:03:41.910> of

over here so do your bottom one first of

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.850 
over here so do your bottom one first of
course<00:03:43.370> give<00:03:44.370> it<00:03:44.430> a<00:03:44.489> push<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:45.860> you're

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
course give it a push and you're

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.259 
course give it a push and you're
probably<00:03:47.010> going<00:03:47.190> to<00:03:47.280> want<00:03:47.370> to<00:03:47.519> pull<00:03:47.820> the<00:03:48.000> tab

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
probably going to want to pull the tab

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.770 
probably going to want to pull the tab
side<00:03:48.690> a<00:03:48.720> little<00:03:48.959> bit<00:03:49.080> so<00:03:49.260> you<00:03:49.320> don't<00:03:49.440> break<00:03:49.709> it

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
side a little bit so you don't break it

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.300 
side a little bit so you don't break it
just<00:03:51.780> push<00:03:51.930> it<00:03:51.959> down<00:03:52.170> in<00:03:52.320> there<00:03:52.440> until<00:03:52.590> there

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
just push it down in there until there

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.330 
just push it down in there until there
we<00:03:53.430> go<00:03:53.550> it<00:03:53.790> clicks<00:03:54.560> same<00:03:55.560> thing<00:03:55.890> with<00:03:56.160> the

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
we go it clicks same thing with the

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.940 
we go it clicks same thing with the
other<00:03:56.370> piece<00:03:58.760> if<00:03:59.760> I<00:03:59.880> can<00:04:00.060> get<00:04:00.180> into<00:04:00.450> it<00:04:00.950> might

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
other piece if I can get into it might

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.370 
other piece if I can get into it might
might<00:04:02.519> add<00:04:02.700> that<00:04:02.730> crucial<00:04:03.540> memory<00:04:03.930> is<00:04:04.170> very

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
might add that crucial memory is very

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.310 
might add that crucial memory is very
good<00:04:04.590> I<00:04:04.620> think<00:04:05.300> owc<00:04:06.300> is<00:04:06.450> good<00:04:06.690> if<00:04:06.870> I<00:04:07.019> have<00:04:07.200> any

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
good I think owc is good if I have any

then go down to about this mac click on

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.140 
then go down to about this mac click on
that<00:05:04.530> there<00:05:04.800> we<00:05:04.950> go<00:05:05.100> see<00:05:05.400> processor<00:05:06.030> and

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
that there we go see processor and

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.480 
that there we go see processor and
memory<00:05:06.240> information<00:05:06.930> for<00:05:07.140> memory<00:05:07.410> we<00:05:07.950> do<00:05:08.220> see

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
memory information for memory we do see
