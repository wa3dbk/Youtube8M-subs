better<00:00:11.190> that<00:00:11.580> game<00:00:11.849> what<00:00:12.389> do<00:00:12.450> they<00:00:12.540> do<00:00:12.599> right

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
better that game what do they do right

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.799 
better that game what do they do right
that<00:00:13.049> time<00:00:13.200> right<00:00:13.889> so<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.610> very<00:00:15.089> interesting

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
that time right so a very interesting

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.200 
that time right so a very interesting
thing<00:00:16.109> that<00:00:16.139> game<00:00:16.529> was<00:00:16.859> Lucien<00:00:17.430> had<00:00:17.550> teleport

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
thing that game was Lucien had teleport

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.510 
thing that game was Lucien had teleport
I<00:00:18.449> think<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.109> idea<00:00:19.230> behind<00:00:19.710> that<00:00:19.980> was<00:00:20.250> rise

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
I think the idea behind that was rise

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.189 
I think the idea behind that was rise
really<00:00:20.910> wants<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:21.210> 1v1<00:00:21.570> right<00:00:21.840> because<00:00:22.050> he's

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
really wants a 1v1 right because he's

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.570 
really wants a 1v1 right because he's
like<00:00:22.320> worse<00:00:22.619> champion<00:00:23.039> in<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.189> world<00:00:23.369> and

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
like worse champion in the world and

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.849 
like worse champion in the world and
won't<00:00:23.730> be<00:00:23.820> too<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:24.660> guess<00:00:24.750> their<00:00:25.470> idea<00:00:25.830> was

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
won't be too so I guess their idea was

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.740 
won't be too so I guess their idea was
like<00:00:26.160> if<00:00:26.430> in<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.820> case<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.240> they<00:00:27.359> have<00:00:27.599> the

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
like if in the case that they have the

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.779 
like if in the case that they have the
wrong<00:00:27.960> lanes<00:00:28.260> say<00:00:28.920> they<00:00:29.070> went<00:00:29.250> bottom<00:00:29.460> there

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
wrong lanes say they went bottom there

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:30.679 
wrong lanes say they went bottom there
were<00:00:29.880> not<00:00:30.029> considered<00:00:30.330> they<00:00:30.480> could<00:00:30.599> like

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
were not considered they could like

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.500 
were not considered they could like
teleport<00:00:31.170> up<00:00:31.289> or<00:00:31.439> something<00:00:31.830> but<00:00:32.210> I'll<00:00:33.210> see

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
teleport up or something but I'll see

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.700 
teleport up or something but I'll see
that<00:00:33.540> didn't<00:00:33.870> work<00:00:33.930> out<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:34.140> well<00:00:34.380> because

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
that didn't work out that well because

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.229 
that didn't work out that well because
he<00:00:34.860> tried<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.130> 1v1<00:00:35.370> graves<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.850> couple<00:00:36.120> times

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
he tried to 1v1 graves a couple times

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.700 
he tried to 1v1 graves a couple times
and<00:00:36.600> loss<00:00:36.899> because<00:00:37.170> he<00:00:37.290> didn't<00:00:37.530> have<00:00:37.680> a

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
and loss because he didn't have a

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.850 
and loss because he didn't have a
summoner<00:00:38.100> spell<00:00:38.309> yeah<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:39.300> think<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:39.860> idea

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
summoner spell yeah so I think that idea

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.520 
summoner spell yeah so I think that idea
behind<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.430> teleport<00:00:41.850> 80k<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:42.450> fine<00:00:43.050> but<00:00:43.379> it

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
behind the teleport 80k is fine but it

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.560 
behind the teleport 80k is fine but it
didn't<00:00:43.680> work<00:00:43.800> out<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:43.980> well<00:00:44.280> at<00:00:44.640> all<00:00:44.820> alright

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
didn't work out that well at all alright

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.910 
didn't work out that well at all alright
so<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.719> neck<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:46.020> course<00:00:46.200> when<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.350> team

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
so the neck of course when the team

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:47.959 
so the neck of course when the team
fights<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:47.219> mean<00:00:47.340> just<00:00:47.489> aside<00:00:47.730> from<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.940> couple

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
fights I mean just aside from a couple

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.940 
fights I mean just aside from a couple
of<00:00:48.300> duals<00:00:48.510> like<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.989> know<00:00:49.260> game<00:00:49.590> one<00:00:49.800> was

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
of duals like I know game one was

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.770 
of duals like I know game one was
decided<00:00:50.489> by<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.610> couple<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:50.940> like<00:00:51.120> oh<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.600> wish

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
decided by a couple of like oh the wish

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.389 
decided by a couple of like oh the wish
turned<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.110> fight<00:00:52.289> around<00:00:52.559> but<00:00:52.829> was<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.340> the

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
turned the fight around but was it the

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.860 
turned the fight around but was it the
same<00:00:53.489> condition<00:00:54.149> where<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.329> couple<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.719> fights

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
same condition where a couple of fights

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.180 
same condition where a couple of fights
turned<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.260> game<00:00:55.440> or<00:00:55.620> was<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.920> difference

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
turned the game or was it a difference

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.639 
turned the game or was it a difference
with<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.309> formula<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.120> entire<00:00:57.840> game<00:00:58.140> went

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
with a formula so that entire game went

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.160 
with a formula so that entire game went
off<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.129> team<00:00:59.309> fights<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.820> fact<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.180> c9

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
off of the team fights the fact that c9

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.470 
off of the team fights the fact that c9
lost<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.590> few<00:01:01.800> big<00:01:02.250> fights<00:01:02.640> was<00:01:02.940> basically<00:01:03.300> the

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
lost a few big fights was basically the

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.240 
lost a few big fights was basically the
game<00:01:03.690> when<00:01:04.170> you're<00:01:04.320> not<00:01:04.439> winning<00:01:04.680> team<00:01:05.010> fights

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
Morgana and was other one when helping

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.660 
Morgana and was other one when helping
at<00:02:51.390> renekton<00:02:52.350> pretty<00:02:52.590> early<00:02:52.920> yeah<00:02:53.430> but

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
at renekton pretty early yeah but

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
they're 12 they didn't take lewisham

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.690 
they're 12 they didn't take lewisham
there<00:02:55.380> so<00:02:55.560> then<00:02:55.710> seemingly<00:02:55.980> illusion<00:02:56.580> back

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
there so then seemingly illusion back

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.310 
there so then seemingly illusion back
yeah<00:02:56.970> at<00:02:57.060> least<00:02:57.180> so<00:02:57.660> you<00:02:57.690> take<00:02:57.930> a<00:02:57.960> lease<00:02:58.170> away

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
yeah at least so you take a lease away

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.350 
yeah at least so you take a lease away
from<00:02:58.470> Cortez<00:02:58.830> with<00:02:59.040> two<00:02:59.160> junglers<00:02:59.520> band<00:02:59.760> so

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
from Cortez with two junglers band so

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.030 
from Cortez with two junglers band so
the<00:03:00.750> trifecta<00:03:01.170> of<00:03:01.350> junglers<00:03:01.620> are<00:03:01.830> kind<00:03:01.980> of

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
the trifecta of junglers are kind of

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.530 
the trifecta of junglers are kind of
gone<00:03:02.250> because<00:03:02.670> cork<00:03:02.910> has<00:03:03.060> doesn't<00:03:03.420> play

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
gone because cork has doesn't play

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.630 
gone because cork has doesn't play

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
Leeson he's forced on the lower tier

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.570 
Leeson he's forced on the lower tier
jungler<00:03:06.000> so<00:03:06.390> that's<00:03:06.540> a<00:03:06.630> great<00:03:06.750> pic<00:03:07.050> by<00:03:07.580> album

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
jungler so that's a great pic by album

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.220 
jungler so that's a great pic by album
kill<00:03:08.790> but<00:03:09.210> they<00:03:09.300> also<00:03:09.480> didn't<00:03:09.810> take<00:03:09.870> Lucian

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
kill but they also didn't take Lucian

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.780 
kill but they also didn't take Lucian
for<00:03:10.380> some<00:03:10.860> reason<00:03:11.130> which<00:03:11.220> i'm<00:03:11.340> not<00:03:11.460> sure<00:03:11.610> why

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
for some reason which i'm not sure why

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.190 
for some reason which i'm not sure why
that's<00:03:12.390> probably<00:03:12.690> because<00:03:12.810> they're<00:03:12.990> okay

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
that's probably because they're okay

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.200 
that's probably because they're okay
with<00:03:13.230> graves<00:03:13.530> so<00:03:14.010> c9<00:03:14.310> got<00:03:14.490> Lucian<00:03:14.790> back<00:03:15.000> which

is<00:03:15.330> good<00:03:15.480> for<00:03:15.510> them<00:03:15.750> but<00:03:16.320> they<00:03:16.980> picked<00:03:17.490> a

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
is good for them but they picked a

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.190 
is good for them but they picked a
terrible<00:03:17.760> summoner<00:03:18.209> spell<00:03:18.420> and<00:03:18.600> gal<00:03:18.900> played

kens was something that actually wanted

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.220 
kens was something that actually wanted
to<00:03:20.970> focus<00:03:21.090> on<00:03:21.390> because<00:03:21.690> it<00:03:21.810> looked<00:03:21.990> like<00:03:22.080> they

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
to focus on because it looked like they

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.600 
to focus on because it looked like they
exposed<00:03:22.560> a<00:03:22.650> little<00:03:22.860> bit<00:03:22.950> of<00:03:23.040> a<00:03:23.100> weakness<00:03:23.370> here

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
exposed a little bit of a weakness here

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.460 
exposed a little bit of a weakness here
for<00:03:24.060> me<00:03:24.150> I've<00:03:24.300> always<00:03:24.510> only<00:03:24.900> remembered<00:03:25.350> him

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720

elder<00:03:30.840> do<00:03:31.230> you<00:03:31.290> think<00:03:31.500> that<00:03:31.590> lmq<00:03:31.950> will

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
elder do you think that lmq will

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.010 
elder do you think that lmq will
actually<00:03:32.820> latch<00:03:33.090> on<00:03:33.300> to<00:03:33.330> that<00:03:33.570> and<00:03:33.600> try<00:03:33.900> and

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
actually latch on to that and try and

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.290 
actually latch on to that and try and
focus<00:03:34.200> one<00:03:34.530> person<00:03:34.950> now<00:03:35.760> that<00:03:35.910> they<00:03:35.970> are<00:03:36.000> back

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
focus one person now that they are back

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.850 
focus one person now that they are back
on<00:03:36.540> first<00:03:36.900> pick<00:03:37.140> how<00:03:37.350> do<00:03:37.410> you<00:03:37.470> think<00:03:37.650> this<00:03:37.740> is

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
on first pick how do you think this is

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:38.960 
on first pick how do you think this is
going<00:03:37.950> to<00:03:38.040> switch<00:03:38.220> it<00:03:38.340> up<00:03:38.370> going<00:03:38.640> into<00:03:38.820> Game

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
going to switch it up going into Game

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.910 
going to switch it up going into Game
three<00:03:39.209> right<00:03:39.690> so<00:03:39.930> I<00:03:40.140> think<00:03:40.230> it<00:03:40.530> is<00:03:40.560> a<00:03:40.709> good

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
three right so I think it is a good

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.740 
three right so I think it is a good
strategy<00:03:41.070> to<00:03:41.340> focus<00:03:41.760> Cortez<00:03:42.150> he<00:03:42.360> likes<00:03:42.570> his

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
strategy to focus Cortez he likes his

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.630 
strategy to focus Cortez he likes his
Elise<00:03:43.050> he<00:03:43.410> likes<00:03:43.650> his<00:03:43.830> kha'zix<00:03:44.220> and<00:03:44.370> he<00:03:44.430> likes

Elise he likes his kha'zix and he likes
his<00:03:44.790> Eve<00:03:44.940> why<00:03:45.450> because<00:03:45.810> those<00:03:46.140> are<00:03:46.350> three<00:03:46.530> good

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
his Eve why because those are three good

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.380 
his Eve why because those are three good
junglers<00:03:47.160> and<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.760> fact<00:03:47.970> that<00:03:48.030> it<00:03:48.180> doesn't

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
junglers and the fact that it doesn't

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.090 
junglers and the fact that it doesn't
play<00:03:48.600> Lee<00:03:48.780> sin<00:03:49.020> if<00:03:49.320> you<00:03:49.530> can<00:03:49.650> take<00:03:49.860> care<00:03:50.040> of

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
play Lee sin if you can take care of

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.320 
play Lee sin if you can take care of
three<00:03:50.340> of<00:03:50.430> those<00:03:50.520> and<00:03:50.580> leave<00:03:50.910> these<00:03:51.060> him<00:03:51.209> up

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
three of those and leave these him up

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.970 
three of those and leave these him up
he's<00:03:51.540> not<00:03:51.570> gonna<00:03:51.840> pick<00:03:52.110> that<00:03:52.140> so<00:03:52.739> then<00:03:52.860> he's

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
he's not gonna pick that so then he's

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.500 
he's not gonna pick that so then he's
automatically<00:03:53.520> forced<00:03:53.850> into<00:03:54.060> a<00:03:54.090> lower<00:03:54.300> tier

whatever he feels like playing and when
you<00:03:58.410> have<00:03:58.440> a<00:03:58.530> jungler<00:03:58.890> advantage<00:03:59.370> you<00:03:59.550> have

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
you have a jungler advantage you have

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.460 
you have a jungler advantage you have
Matt<00:03:59.940> pressure<00:04:00.180> you<00:04:00.570> have<00:04:00.600> map<00:04:00.870> event<00:04:01.200> to<00:04:01.320> join

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
Matt pressure you have map event to join

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.650 
Matt pressure you have map event to join
them<00:04:01.620> so<00:04:02.160> then<00:04:02.310> it's<00:04:02.610> a<00:04:02.910> very<00:04:03.180> good<00:04:03.239> strategy

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
them so then it's a very good strategy

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.960 
them so then it's a very good strategy
