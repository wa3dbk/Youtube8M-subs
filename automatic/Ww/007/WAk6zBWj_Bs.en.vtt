00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
out and use it like that what I've done

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.180 
out and use it like that what I've done
is<00:00:41.790> put<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.780> charcoal<00:00:43.290> into<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.649> little<00:00:43.950> makeup

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
probably get something like this because

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.729 
probably get something like this because

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.860 
charcoal is really messy that's the bad
thing<00:00:53.039> about<00:00:53.070> this<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.789> it's<00:00:54.510> such<00:00:54.840> a

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
thing about this is that it's such a

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.590 
thing about this is that it's such a
mess<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:55.890> just<00:00:56.070> be<00:00:56.160> really<00:00:56.430> careful<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:57.480> know

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
mess so just be really careful you know

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.500 
mess so just be really careful you know
don't<00:00:57.930> be<00:00:58.350> waving<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.340> around<00:00:59.399> everywhere<00:01:00.120> so

I'm just going to give you a quick
demonstration<00:01:01.980> on<00:01:02.670> how<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.359> can<00:01:03.600> use<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.780> I

demonstration on how you can use it I
found<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.379> few<00:01:04.650> different<00:01:04.979> ways<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.339> do<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.519> you

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
found a few different ways to do it you

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.300 
found a few different ways to do it you
can<00:01:06.420> either<00:01:06.570> use<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.260> smoke<00:01:07.650> out<00:01:07.860> eyes

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
can either use it to smoke out eyes

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.000 
can either use it to smoke out eyes
shadow<00:01:08.670> or<00:01:08.970> eyeliner<00:01:09.420> or<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.380> can<00:01:10.530> use<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.680> as

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
shadow or eyeliner or you can use it as

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.450 
shadow or eyeliner or you can use it as
a<00:01:11.510> liner<00:01:12.510> right<00:01:12.720> here<00:01:13.229> use<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.590> dry<00:01:13.830> or<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.189> can

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
a liner right here use it dry or you can

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.820 
a liner right here use it dry or you can
use<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:14.610> wet<00:01:14.970> for<00:01:15.450> more<00:01:15.659> precision<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:16.740> I'm

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
use it wet for more precision so I'm

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.770 
use it wet for more precision so I'm
just<00:01:16.950> going<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.159> show<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.369> how<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.670> looks<00:01:17.880> dry

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.039 

so<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.840> just<00:01:22.020> takes<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.380> little<00:01:22.470> bit<00:01:22.619> right<00:01:22.890> here

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
so it just takes a little bit right here

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:37.890 
so it just takes a little bit right here
and<00:01:25.049> then<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.229> kind<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.500> Pat<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.740> off<00:01:25.950> maybe

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.510 

and<00:01:38.900> then<00:01:39.020> you<00:01:39.140> just<00:01:39.350> kind<00:01:39.560> of<00:01:39.650> push<00:01:40.220> it<00:01:40.250> in

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
and then you just kind of push it in

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.980 
and then you just kind of push it in
like<00:01:40.550> you<00:01:40.880> would<00:01:41.060> within<00:01:41.330> that<00:01:41.450> uh<00:01:41.510> normal<00:01:41.870> I

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
like you would within that uh normal I

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.930 
like you would within that uh normal I
shut<00:01:42.260> up<00:01:45.340> as<00:01:46.600> you<00:01:47.600> can<00:01:47.720> see<00:01:47.780> my<00:01:48.140> mascara

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
shut up as you can see my mascara

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.050 
shut up as you can see my mascara
smudged<00:01:49.940> today<00:01:50.360> but<00:01:50.720> oh<00:01:51.020> well<00:01:51.790> I'm<00:01:52.790> just<00:01:52.880> going

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
smudged today but oh well I'm just going

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:01.390 
smudged today but oh well I'm just going
to<00:01:53.150> get<00:01:53.240> some<00:01:53.450> more<00:01:59.470> so<00:02:00.470> this<00:02:00.650> is<00:02:00.770> using<00:02:00.920> it<00:02:01.130> dry

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
to get some more so this is using it dry

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.060 
to get some more so this is using it dry
and<00:02:01.760> it<00:02:02.180> kind<00:02:02.420> of<00:02:02.480> creates<00:02:02.810> a<00:02:02.960> smudgy<00:02:03.560> softer

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
and it kind of creates a smudgy softer

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:16.270 
and it kind of creates a smudgy softer
effect

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.160 

I'm<00:02:17.280> not<00:02:17.490> very<00:02:17.610> good<00:02:17.760> at<00:02:17.910> doing<00:02:18.360> eyeliner<00:02:18.900> on

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170

liner brush wet in the sink or something
but<00:03:01.040> just<00:03:02.040> doing<00:03:02.250> it<00:03:02.340> like<00:03:02.520> that<00:03:02.700> I'm<00:03:03.000> gonna

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
but just doing it like that I'm gonna

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.290 
but just doing it like that I'm gonna
turn<00:03:03.300> to<00:03:03.390> this<00:03:03.660> side<00:03:03.900> now<00:03:04.080> and<00:03:04.380> just<00:03:05.120> draw<00:03:06.120> it

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
turn to this side now and just draw it

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:17.780 
turn to this side now and just draw it
on

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.399 

so<00:03:18.390> yeah<00:03:18.510> this<00:03:18.629> is<00:03:18.750> what<00:03:18.870> it<00:03:18.959> looks<00:03:19.110> like<00:03:19.230> when

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:19.409 
so yeah this is what it looks like when

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:21.589 
so yeah this is what it looks like when
I<00:03:19.439> did<00:03:19.560> it<00:03:19.709> wet<00:03:19.980> I<00:03:20.310> mean<00:03:20.849> I<00:03:20.939> guess<00:03:21.120> they<00:03:21.269> do<00:03:21.330> look

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
I did it wet I mean I guess they do look

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.210 
I did it wet I mean I guess they do look
pretty<00:03:21.659> similar<00:03:22.319> but<00:03:22.500> this<00:03:22.709> one<00:03:22.890> is<00:03:23.010> just<00:03:23.159> a

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
pretty similar but this one is just a

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.520 
pretty similar but this one is just a
little<00:03:23.430> stronger<00:03:23.790> a<00:03:24.209> little<00:03:24.659> more<00:03:24.900> graphic<00:03:25.140> II

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
little stronger a little more graphic II

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.100 
little stronger a little more graphic II
and<00:03:25.879> I<00:03:26.879> kind<00:03:27.120> of<00:03:27.180> preferred<00:03:27.510> this<00:03:27.659> side<00:03:27.900> more

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
and I kind of preferred this side more

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.720 
and I kind of preferred this side more
than<00:03:28.170> this<00:03:28.439> side<00:03:28.709> but<00:03:28.950> it<00:03:29.069> depends<00:03:29.519> what<00:03:29.640> you

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
than this side but it depends what you

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.580 
than this side but it depends what you
look<00:03:30.000> you're<00:03:30.150> going<00:03:30.329> for<00:03:30.390> then<00:03:31.110> of<00:03:31.230> course<00:03:31.439> you

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
look you're going for then of course you

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.410 
look you're going for then of course you
can<00:03:31.769> take<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.189> same<00:03:32.400> liner<00:03:32.700> and<00:03:33.090> just<00:03:33.269> go

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
can take the same liner and just go

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.880 
can take the same liner and just go
underneath<00:03:33.780> if<00:03:34.140> you<00:03:34.349> like<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:34.709> have

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
underneath if you like to have

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:42.770

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
definition underneath not a big fan of

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.270 
definition underneath not a big fan of
liner<00:03:43.170> underneath<00:03:43.530> but<00:03:43.829> I<00:03:43.890> just<00:03:44.040> wanted<00:03:44.190> to

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
little idea on what to use as an

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.300 
little idea on what to use as an
alternative<00:03:51.000> to<00:03:51.329> traditional<00:03:51.659> eyeliner<00:03:52.620> it's

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
alternative to traditional eyeliner it's

alternative to traditional eyeliner it's
cheaper<00:03:53.879> it<00:03:54.299> lasts<00:03:54.780> just<00:03:54.840> as<00:03:55.109> long<00:03:55.349> and<00:03:56.090> it's

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
cheaper it lasts just as long and it's

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.190 
cheaper it lasts just as long and it's
just<00:03:57.180> kind<00:03:57.420> of<00:03:57.480> cool<00:03:57.659> that<00:03:57.840> you're<00:03:57.989> putting
