 ground tree chili is very good 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.580
 about two teaspoons a little bit of thaksin 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.210
 that this already comes with a little 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.710
 lemon 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.710

 tuna 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.670
 and we 're going to go through our mix of 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.670
 chilies 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.680
 that they crust well in pretty 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.260
 by the sides 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.820
 That this 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:03.690
 well impregnated all our steak 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:07.230
 while I go up a pan 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.940
 to the name low fire in the tuna more 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.130
 we are going to seal the envelopes on the outside 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.780
 that we are left half term inside 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.780
 we go back to olive oil 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.660
 what is heating the oil if you want 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.640
 they can be helped by hand 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.390
 so that everything that 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.830
 it's sesame seeds and chilies 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.830
 the sides too 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.500
 and if they are not in a hurry they can leave it in 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.530
 the fridge 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.610
 about 45 minutes and they will be very 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.780
 all right 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.500
 okay 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.840
 it's ready 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.350

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.350
 to the fire 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.830
 and we put our tegra turn 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.940
 that we will be given a little bit of a side 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:15.760
 about one minute no more 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.340
 and then we're going to flip it while 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.540
 you want to accompany this steak what 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.000
 let's go with a little bit of 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.540
 mayonnaise and they will put a little bit of 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.540
 soy sauce 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.070
 a soy tureen 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.190
 and stir their mayonnaise well 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.110
 we flipped it 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.350
 we work other minutes on that side 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.290
 okay 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:03.450
 we have the mayonnaise here and we are going to take out 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:06.620
 the tuna stec that is ready 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:10.129
 let's turn off the fire 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.610
 and then take out slices of a 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:12.610
 knife 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.230
 let's take it out on 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:26.229
 as the width of a finger a centimeter 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.229
 centimeter and a half 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.509
 It is a very rich snack 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.130
 but let's place what 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.910
 there is less with a creed 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.910
 raw inside 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:58.820
 let's accompany it with our mayonnaise 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.820
 you can put it aside 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:10.800
 and with the powder that was left of the 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.210
 mix that we made for the brass it 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.360
 can decorate with a little bit above 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:18.169
 the Mayo 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:20.780
 correct and as a final touch we can 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:22.950
 Squeeze some lemon on top of the 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:26.120
 tuna 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.120
 a few drops of lemon 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:31.270
 Well, we already have our cat 

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:35.580
