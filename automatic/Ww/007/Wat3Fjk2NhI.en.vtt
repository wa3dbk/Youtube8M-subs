00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.440
 tree and you will also find the 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:41.200
 instructions how to do it in carton 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:44.350
 I will paint my little tree light green 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.430
 the base of dark green and the candles 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.430
 yellow as 1 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.250
 what we have to do is mark the 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:59.240
 soil base as the base of the 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.030
 tree and join the four parts so that 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.520
 you are resistant 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.350
 we will open the hole that most marks what 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.540
 before and we will fill it with cola 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.910
 we stick the base of the tree with the base 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.250
 of the ground and reinforced by back with 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.380
 tail 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.690
 and the star that we give with silicone and 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.680
 if there is any excess of silicones and what 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.689
 we can remove later 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.319
 also collaborate we have to open the 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:27.359
 clip in half and with the pliers 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.840
 do this so that he removes the ball 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:35.040
 we make a curve shape 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:37.819
 and cut the excess with a plier and 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.819
 ready 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.730
 and so we were all nice Christmas 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.140
 easy economic 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.080
 we will start doing a circumference 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.640
 40 centimeters long and we 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.100
 we forget about chickweed activity 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.720
 continuation if all the measurements and 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.420
 these horrible things that I'm seeing 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.160
 will leave the forgettable circle I will stay 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.410
 just with this and we come to 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.620
 find the means I already found 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.420
 me and so we will do with the 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.000
 smaller circumference as a 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.120
 compass cut out conference station 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.069
 staying like that with the frame 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.049
 the frame will be painted a green 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.600
 dark that the truth seems super 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.510
 Christmas 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:25.410
 half of the chemical pieces are 24 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:28.819
 the pint of light green and the other half 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.769
 of dark greens 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:33.409
 the filtered we have to place of 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:36.469
 so that within the party is 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:38.390
 where it opens and and the part where 

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:41.690
 place whatever 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.700
 outside the frame I do not know if you understand me what 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.610
 let's see all super super and first mega 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.510
 well so that this one has ceased and not 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.510
 I would only be cleared 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.480
 and now we go with the whip the picture of 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.610
 whom I found in a Chinese bazaar 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.610
 so for one euro 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.500
 and for the hook I have used a 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:08.000
 wire and I have reinforced it with a cardboard 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:13.010
 and many many many circles 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.680
 and ready is already agreed and put 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.560
 our little things this congratulation 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:25.850
 urban song carols of apples 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:27.480

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.350
