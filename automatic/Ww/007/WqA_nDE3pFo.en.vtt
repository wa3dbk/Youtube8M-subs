00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 and hello to all and of course to all these 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.629
 reactions looking I also have a 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.800
 little video 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:16.109
 today is the 5th of March 2014 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:19.890
 and also opens in a small enough bug 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.980
 nice that it's a bug with the 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.960
 telly and let you see a little that it's 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.619
 enough flying so I'm making money 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.870
 served for 20 minutes exactly 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:35.090
 I am immortal in this bug 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:41.090
 I shoot and we can see below 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:43.010
 us there are two brown So here it is 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.460
 you're going to tell me you're seeing me in the 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.460
 private this is true 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:55.899
 so here I see you on the train on the 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:01:00.180
 train the red train to web a child the 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:03.210
 little ball little red train agree 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.190
 because they do that from the train 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.570
 on the dock 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.580
 we are filming so do not give 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.020
 she is filming at the same time 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.000
 I found a technique that I am 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.160
 ok ok I can do that a quarter of 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.150
 things I can not walk until 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:23.560
 point is jumping to do a lot of 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:26.140
 stuff does not work so to pull those 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.550
 who are there, so we must not 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.550
 shoot we can shoot that from the aa 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.760
 if we want to shoot the guys who are there 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.560
 it's a little walk because it takes 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.430
 first of all we shoot at the guys who 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.020
 are there it's hard to understand 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.420
 if we attract but sometimes it has 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.430
 changed location 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:51.400
 that's it pay badly acquired and on the trick 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:52.900
 scripts and after we had thrown her 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.540
 in vacuum has made it so nothing there 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.260
 I turn around and I pull and put 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.210
 down for example l using an art whose 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.110
 we can but here it is I can kill 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.880
 quietly she was still on the 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.860
 train 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:13.750
 I can kill the guy it depends on the angles 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:17.250
 so we can shoot rocket launcher 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.250
 I think that to shoot those 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.379
 japan who spends hamas and pitroipa 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.379
 level 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.500
 remake 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.500
 eh yes 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.440
 you pull the trigger for example 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.319
 and there just hop turn to have his share 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.290
 all alone is very much supported by the 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.920
 capture and that is good is the project 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:59.180
 coconut trees 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:59.180
 jeanne smoke to fucking I touched the way 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.290
 here to go out I do not know at all 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.290
 what has to be done 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.790
 I 'm rather facing the German train station 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.480

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:24.150

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:25.080

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.280

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.450
