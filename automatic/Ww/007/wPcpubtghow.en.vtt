00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.620
 Hello women 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:12.520
 [Music] 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.940
 and super happy is that I feel like 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.830
 Much recording and is very happy that she 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.470
 we are going to make a piece of furniture that is 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.240
 precious I absolutely love it already 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.150
 that she lives a short time ago 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.360
 We are installing approximately 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.340
 About two months I moved from Garcia in 2006 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.070
 about two months ago I moved 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.720
 so then I wanted to fill in the 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.690
 space by all the goals are 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.149
 very expensive indeed, and then 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.649
 I found this idea that is super cool 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:46.270
 I love how it looks to make a 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:47.949
 furniture that remains divine and makes 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.620
 any space will be superchulo what 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.570
 you can use good if you live with your 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.000
 You can use it in your room 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.590
 or if you are like in that process that 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.230
 the sound starts to come out you can 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.300
 make her of this beautiful precious of the 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.030
 precious the truth is that it's good that 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.670
 the vintage and its antiques are 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.320
 like being born because the truth is 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.450
 that we can adapt bastantitos that 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.490
 these things are super cheap to do this 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.590
 furniture will cost you almost nothing then 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.659
 Strangled and well I'm going to 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.520
 shut up a good time let's start with 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.760
 the tutorial so you can see it 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.760
 I hope you like it 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.010
 this idea is vital all these things a 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.040
 super easy to get and the best is 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.930
 which is very very cheap we need 9 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.790
 huacales for example here in mexico what 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.890
 you get on the market in any 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.110
 side you see paint in the color that you 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.550
 you prefer I have them green but 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.620
 you can by the white equal it would be 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.620
 super cute a paint brush 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.390
 and a wooden board if you want that 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.100
 last longer then you can varnish it 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.950
 only thing you have to do is paint 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.080
 all your crates or streets of color 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.180
 that you prefer, you can not paint it as 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.550
 super perfect if this is like going to 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.920
 give the touch old man you know and basically 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.630
 is what we have to do with the 9 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.790
 I think that with a little leaf he told you but 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.730
 It would be super cute in white with that I think 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.039
 the truth is that I like 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.039
 [Music] 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.290
 that's how we would stay and that's it 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.900
 It fits to finish the only thing we have 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.020
 what to do is accommodate our our 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.830
 deadly boxes or as bulerÃ­as you put 3 3 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.830
 3 and 3 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.360
 [Music] 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.849
 to finish I chose it was very easy 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.280
 let's put our table in the part 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.260
 from above and now it's the coolest good thing to 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.360
 I like this, let's decorate like 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.400
 all our crates and put the 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.560
 things that we need to accommodate and I think 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.420
 which is a super nice style but it 's 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.069
 very fast to do and I think it makes 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.049
 any space look cuter by 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.879
 at least I loved this idea to 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.120
 what do you think they like what 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.120
 would do 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.710
 I hope you have enjoyed it enough 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.080
 you liked it as much as me 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.330
 I'm super sincere I'm a fan of this 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.160
 completely fan I hope that you 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.110
 like it and I'm fascinated I tell you 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.970
 heart heart that is nice 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.620
 I hope you put it into practice now 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.750
 you know if you do it to me I would like 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.640
 very much see your photos I simple I say and already 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.890
 it's being that I'm bored to tell you 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.360
 but it does fascinate me to see your photos and see 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.370
 what they do because they always have 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.140
 better than me the truth you already know that 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.810
 I have social networks like a Facebook 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.850
 as on twitter as a drive as a 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.230
 instance can upload your creation in 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.330
 any of them and me you're 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.700
 I hope you have a great weekend 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.110
 I'm so neighborhood and we hear a lot 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.620
 pool was laughing always you 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.090
 something else happens that I wanted to live super 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.130
 important although it has nothing to do 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.110
 is that sometimes I think we're 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.210
 wasting our lives worrying about 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.370
 many things and we are not aware 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.860
 that life is beautiful you know I am 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.900
 happy that I love them they are here 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.030
 love I do not know what I love you 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.130
 who loves the people you're telling 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.140
 what you feel you know you really enjoy 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.920
 the moment and do not worry about little things 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.200
 and the point 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.940
 of what it is that once a long time ago 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.470
 that he enjoyed at the moment he made the 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.180
 area that they tell people that the 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.099
 wants as soon as the love controls 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.650
 during how happy are the arm leave 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:16.810
 spend time and do not be do not get 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.820
 Problems for anything you enjoy 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.040
 the life that I say that in pairs already 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.050
 They know that I am super happy so 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.510

 family and that makes me completely 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.180

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.830
