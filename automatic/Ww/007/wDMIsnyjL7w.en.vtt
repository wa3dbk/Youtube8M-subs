00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.619
 the disappointment is deeply natural 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.860
 After the lost Schwyz at the end of 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:20.890
 three four days six possible points 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.570
 given at least yes 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.489
 maybe even four 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.730
 maybe also three possible 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:29.289
 Good mirror come I think we have 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.309
 then have then fought the 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:35.589
 compensation then get one 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.239
 second half similar to the one in the 

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:39.269
 first half a very funny goal 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.750
 again 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:44.920
 which just should not happen 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.820
 and then unfortunately we have it in the 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.180
 second half did not work out yes 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:55.329
 to shoot more on goal 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.699
 where we can say that we are with 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.640
 a tie or even the game 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.780
 Collector is able to win 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.859
 Of course, very difficult for us 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.259
 Of course, we also planned a lot 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:06.789
 have the first player the English 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:08.890
 week is not over yet that is why it is 

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:10.630
 so that we can do the things now too 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.920
 but also addressed today 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.160
 Nevertheless, the view is to go forward 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.880
 we are back on saturday 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:20.679
 have real board in front of the door and 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.569
 the requirement is different because 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:23.470
 Everyone honestly thinks after the 

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:26.170
 first two play that he is there 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.910
 maybe chance does not exist 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.530
 exactly in it a small chance but what 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:33.009
 have to take along well now 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.800
 have to watch that we regenerate 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.739
 get heads free quickly and 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.910
 then with full concentration and 

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:42.640
 Highest use in the forestay 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.750
 playfully absolutely top team this 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.530
 now also proved against 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.330
 to win bavaria 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.770
 the first team this year 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.060
 I believe in the game on everyone 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.940
 seen with what quality there 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.349
 appeared 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.810
 nevertheless, it will be a game 

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:58.090
 where to hold against where 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.280
 maybe if we want to take something 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.390
 maybe need a whole game with 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.720
 few chances maybe one 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.739
 standard situation to succeed 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.599
 but as already said on the 

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:09.550
 program first time the regeneration too 

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:11.500
 the refurbishment of the last game 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.640
 of yesterday and then we have 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.050
 tomorrow like the final training 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.740
 with us on the opponent on it adjust 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.750
 become 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.010
 as well as the match plan will look like and 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.900
 then it's off again after 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.300
 wolfsburg and we expect a lot 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:28.780
 hard game for have to be very defensive 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:29.830
 well are better available and easy to us 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.270
 fight in the games 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.800
 i think if we have the fight 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:37.630
 come to meet us because we 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.770
 The quality in any case have around in 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.250
 Rostock gates to shoot something to take away 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.930
 can 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.900
 I think we have to be allowed to 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.110
 do not drive us crazy yes we do 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.070
 started the second half 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.600
 Nevertheless, we must be aware of it 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.200
 and just have to shit 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.770
 drauflegen and yes in any case over 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.770
 to fight
