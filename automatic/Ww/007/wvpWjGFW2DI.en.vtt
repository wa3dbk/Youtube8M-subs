00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
and eight trees in total in the entire

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.480 
and eight trees in total in the entire
map<00:04:27.419> I<00:04:27.659> checked<00:04:27.990> in<00:04:28.199> the<00:04:28.470> entire<00:04:28.710> first<00:04:28.949> map<00:04:29.280> is

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
map I checked in the entire first map is

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.610 
map I checked in the entire first map is
eight<00:04:29.699> trees<00:04:30.090> I<00:04:30.360> didn't<00:04:30.990> really<00:04:31.199> look<00:04:31.289> around

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.020 
eight trees I didn't really look around
that<00:04:31.800> much<00:04:31.979> because<00:04:32.189> I<00:04:32.580> thought<00:04:32.759> it<00:04:32.819> would

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
that much because I thought it would

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.029 
that much because I thought it would
kind<00:04:33.300> of<00:04:33.419> a<00:04:33.659> it<00:04:34.169> would<00:04:34.319> kind<00:04:34.500> of<00:04:34.560> spoil<00:04:34.830> it

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:35.039 
kind of a it would kind of spoil it

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:36.800 
kind of a it would kind of spoil it
that's<00:04:35.250> what<00:04:35.400> I<00:04:35.430> did<00:04:35.789> for<00:04:35.939> all<00:04:36.090> of<00:04:36.270> my<00:04:36.389> didn't<00:04:36.659> I

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
that's what I did for all of my didn't I

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.749 
that's what I did for all of my didn't I
didn't<00:04:37.379> look<00:04:37.469> beyond<00:04:37.830> the<00:04:37.860> first<00:04:38.250> map<00:04:38.490> so

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759 
didn't look beyond the first map so

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:40.189 
didn't look beyond the first map so
there's<00:04:38.939> definitely<00:04:39.120> more<00:04:39.659> than<00:04:39.719> what<00:04:40.169> i

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 
there's definitely more than what i
