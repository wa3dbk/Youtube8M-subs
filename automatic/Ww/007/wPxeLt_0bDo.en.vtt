olive color and it's really pretty

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.270

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
because it's got tons of shimmer but it

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.430 
because it's got tons of shimmer but it
just<00:03:41.640> works<00:03:41.880> really<00:03:42.209> well<00:03:42.480> on<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:42.810> crease<00:03:43.140> and

just works really well on the crease and

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.860 
just works really well on the crease and
it<00:03:44.250> kind<00:03:44.489> of<00:03:44.670> complements<00:03:45.269> every<00:03:45.450> other<00:03:45.540> color

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870
