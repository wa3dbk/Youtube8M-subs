00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:28.239 

the<00:02:23.390> rest<00:02:23.629> is<00:02:23.810> kind<00:02:24.049> of<00:02:24.170> easy<00:02:26.319> it<00:02:27.319> hooks<00:02:28.040> in

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:28.249 
the rest is kind of easy it hooks in

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:30.580 
the rest is kind of easy it hooks in
from<00:02:28.489> the<00:02:28.609> top<00:02:28.790> and<00:02:29.109> remember<00:02:30.109> this<00:02:30.349> is<00:02:30.469> all

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
from the top and remember this is all

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.920 
from the top and remember this is all
going<00:02:30.769> backwards<00:02:31.249> hooks<00:02:32.239> in<00:02:32.420> from<00:02:32.599> the<00:02:32.719> top

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
going backwards hooks in from the top

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.239 
going backwards hooks in from the top
the<00:02:33.889> sides<00:02:34.159> and<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.819> bottom<00:02:35.150> all<00:02:36.249> actually

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:37.249 
the sides and the bottom all actually

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:41.080 
the sides and the bottom all actually
push<00:02:37.549> in<00:02:38.829> these<00:02:39.829> green<00:02:40.159> pins<00:02:40.519> that<00:02:40.760> are<00:02:40.849> here

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
push in these green pins that are here

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.000 
push in these green pins that are here
they<00:02:41.480> just<00:02:41.689> push<00:02:41.870> into<00:02:42.109> the<00:02:42.230> holes<00:02:42.409> and<00:02:42.620> you

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
they just push into the holes and you

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.369 
they just push into the holes and you
just<00:02:43.189> pop<00:02:43.340> it<00:02:43.370> right<00:02:43.549> back<00:02:43.700> into<00:02:44.060> place<00:02:44.379> then

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:45.379 
just pop it right back into place then

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:48.550 
just pop it right back into place then
you'll<00:02:45.859> have<00:02:46.040> a<00:02:46.370> screw<00:02:46.879> up<00:02:47.150> here<00:02:47.870> on<00:02:48.019> the<00:02:48.379> door

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
you'll have a screw up here on the door

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.360 
you'll have a screw up here on the door
handle<00:02:49.689> that<00:02:50.689> goes<00:02:50.870> in<00:02:50.989> there<00:02:51.169> then<00:02:52.099> you<00:02:52.129> get<00:02:52.340> a

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
handle that goes in there then you get a

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.580 
handle that goes in there then you get a
screw<00:02:52.669> that<00:02:52.819> goes<00:02:52.999> down<00:02:53.480> here<00:02:53.930> under<00:02:54.230> this

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
screw that goes down here under this

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.259 
screw that goes down here under this
screw<00:02:54.980> on<00:02:55.189> the<00:02:55.310> all<00:02:55.459> the<00:02:55.549> way<00:02:55.609> on<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:55.790> left<00:02:56.030> and

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
screw on the all the way on the left and

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.709 
screw on the all the way on the left and
then<00:02:56.870> you<00:02:56.900> have<00:02:57.169> one<00:02:57.379> that<00:02:57.409> goes<00:02:57.739> in<00:02:57.950> this<00:02:58.099> hole

00:02:58.709 --> 00:02:58.719 
then you have one that goes in this hole

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:01.509 
then you have one that goes in this hole
so<00:02:59.719> basically<00:03:00.590> when<00:03:00.799> you're<00:03:00.919> taking<00:03:01.219> the<00:03:01.250> door

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
so basically when you're taking the door

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:08.470 
so basically when you're taking the door
apart<00:03:02.109> you'd<00:03:03.109> have<00:03:03.290> to<00:03:03.500> remove<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:07.419> try<00:03:08.419> to

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
apart you'd have to remove the try to

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.349 
apart you'd have to remove the try to
get<00:03:08.659> this<00:03:08.780> back<00:03:08.989> up<00:03:09.199> here<00:03:09.669> you<00:03:10.669> remove<00:03:11.000> the

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359 
get this back up here you remove the

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:13.959 
get this back up here you remove the
screw<00:03:11.930> that<00:03:11.959> goes<00:03:12.290> it<00:03:12.500> actually<00:03:13.069> let<00:03:13.730> me<00:03:13.819> try

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:13.969 
screw that goes it actually let me try

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:16.869 
screw that goes it actually let me try
to<00:03:14.030> do<00:03:14.209> this<00:03:14.239> in<00:03:14.540> the<00:03:14.629> right<00:03:14.750> order<00:03:15.760> there's<00:03:16.760> a

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 
to do this in the right order there's a

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:20.199 
to do this in the right order there's a
panel<00:03:17.269> in<00:03:17.419> there<00:03:17.889> so<00:03:18.889> you<00:03:18.949> pull<00:03:19.189> this<00:03:19.669> tab<00:03:19.939> down

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
panel in there so you pull this tab down

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.080 
panel in there so you pull this tab down
pull<00:03:20.719> the<00:03:20.750> panel<00:03:21.169> out<00:03:21.290> and<00:03:21.669> there's<00:03:22.669> a<00:03:22.730> screw

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
pull the panel out and there's a screw

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.869 
pull the panel out and there's a screw
in<00:03:23.209> there<00:03:23.359> pull<00:03:23.810> that<00:03:23.930> screw<00:03:24.199> out<00:03:24.730> then<00:03:25.730> you've

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 
in there pull that screw out then you've

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:29.860 
in there pull that screw out then you've
got<00:03:26.030> this<00:03:26.209> panel<00:03:26.689> on<00:03:26.900> your<00:03:26.959> door<00:03:28.479> this<00:03:29.479> pops

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
got this panel on your door this pops

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.129 
got this panel on your door this pops
off<00:03:30.139> and<00:03:30.470> then<00:03:31.129> on<00:03:31.280> the<00:03:31.370> top<00:03:31.579> there's<00:03:31.909> a

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
off and then on the top there's a

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:35.229 
off and then on the top there's a
there's<00:03:33.139> an<00:03:33.319> actual<00:03:33.590> hinge<00:03:34.459> there<00:03:34.819> that<00:03:35.030> goes

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
there's an actual hinge there that goes

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.210 
there's an actual hinge there that goes
up<00:03:35.540> inside<00:03:36.109> so<00:03:36.409> make<00:03:36.590> sure<00:03:36.620> you<00:03:36.859> don't<00:03:37.040> break

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
up inside so make sure you don't break

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.920 
up inside so make sure you don't break
that<00:03:37.459> when<00:03:37.639> you're<00:03:37.759> popping<00:03:37.970> the<00:03:38.180> bottom<00:03:38.419> part

off first so they pull that off then

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:45.369 
off first so they pull that off then
you've<00:03:43.099> got<00:03:43.370> this<00:03:44.359> screw<00:03:44.659> here<00:03:44.959> on<00:03:45.079> the<00:03:45.169> left

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:45.379 
you've got this screw here on the left

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:47.369 
you've got this screw here on the left
and<00:03:45.680> then<00:03:45.769> you<00:03:45.799> got<00:03:45.979> the<00:03:46.099> same<00:03:46.340> type<00:03:46.879> of<00:03:46.909> screw

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:47.379 
and then you got the same type of screw

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:50.229 
and then you got the same type of screw
here<00:03:48.379> Phillips<00:03:48.979> head<00:03:49.129> on<00:03:49.340> the<00:03:49.759> right<00:03:49.939> side

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
here Phillips head on the right side

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.399 
here Phillips head on the right side
it's<00:03:51.079> in<00:03:51.169> between<00:03:51.290> these<00:03:51.739> two<00:03:52.040> and<00:03:53.409> then

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:54.409
