00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
complacent and maybe wasn't in a

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.020 
complacent and maybe wasn't in a
condition<00:01:45.390> or<00:01:45.990> couldn't<00:01:46.530> make<00:01:47.430> those<00:01:47.729> lower

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030

condition or couldn't make those lower
weights<00:01:48.420> anymore<00:01:50.030> so<00:01:51.030> there<00:01:51.270> are<00:01:51.299> questions

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
weights anymore so there are questions

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.679 
weights anymore so there are questions
out<00:01:52.170> there<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:54.320> maybe<00:01:55.340> opportunities<00:01:56.479> if<00:01:57.479> he

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
out there and maybe opportunities if he

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.709 
out there and maybe opportunities if he
comes<00:01:57.960> back<00:01:58.460> on<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.700> way<00:01:59.850> back<00:02:00.149> out<00:02:00.390> it
