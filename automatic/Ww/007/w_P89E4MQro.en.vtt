00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
should start streaming it so there's one

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.590 
should start streaming it so there's one
way<00:02:37.540> to<00:02:37.570> do<00:02:37.750> it<00:02:38.370> so<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.459> cool<00:02:39.640> thing<00:02:39.670> is<00:02:39.880> all

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
way to do it so the cool thing is all

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.160 
way to do it so the cool thing is all
these<00:02:40.840> tracks<00:02:41.230> have<00:02:41.500> a<00:02:42.269> thing<00:02:43.269> that<00:02:43.299> will<00:02:43.630> take

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
these tracks have a thing that will take

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.569 
these tracks have a thing that will take
you<00:02:44.320> right<00:02:44.350> back<00:02:44.500> to<00:02:44.709> that<00:02:44.860> page<00:02:45.220> we<00:02:45.400> never

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
you right back to that page we never

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:55.480 
you right back to that page we never
pulled<00:02:45.880> from

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.380 

or<00:02:56.060> they<00:02:56.300> should<00:02:57.160> okay<00:02:58.160> so<00:02:58.220> there<00:02:58.640> we<00:02:58.670> are<00:02:58.760> back

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
or they should okay so there we are back

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.240 
or they should okay so there we are back
again<00:03:00.040> so<00:03:02.020> the<00:03:03.020> other<00:03:03.170> way<00:03:03.380> to<00:03:03.440> do<00:03:03.620> it<00:03:03.710> and<00:03:03.860> this

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
again so the other way to do it and this

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.980 
again so the other way to do it and this
actually<00:03:04.730> works<00:03:04.910> a<00:03:05.180> little<00:03:05.390> bit<00:03:05.570> better<00:03:05.720> you

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
actually works a little bit better you

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.810 
actually works a little bit better you
get<00:03:06.110> more<00:03:06.440> information<00:03:06.890> about<00:03:07.220> each<00:03:07.460> track

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
like the name and your file size is to

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:17.140 
like the name and your file size is to
use<00:03:10.550> this<00:03:10.760> play<00:03:11.000> button<00:03:14.800> which<00:03:16.150> does

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
use this play button which does

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.140 
use this play button which does
essentially<00:03:17.900> the<00:03:18.110> same<00:03:18.260> thing<00:03:18.500> except<00:03:18.860> for<00:03:19.150> it

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
essentially the same thing except for it

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.510
