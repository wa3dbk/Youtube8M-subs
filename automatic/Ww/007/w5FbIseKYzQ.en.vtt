00:00:00.509 --> 00:00:02.330
 in the following diagram 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.870
 it's the turn of the white pieces 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.019
 if you were the driver of the white pieces right now 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:11.489
 to play ariel and it would be 

00:00:11.489 --> 00:00:14.709
 Take some time to find the continuation 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:16.039
 stop the clip 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:17.560
 I took pencil and paper 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.720
 and write its continuation 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.720
 to then check the answer 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:27.419
 when analyzing the position 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:30.239
 we can see that the bishop of three 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:31.930
 and the range ds 3 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.840
 can generate checkmate threats 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.530
 in the h7 box 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.310
 the white towers have open column control and 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:41.490
 plus 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.220
 latorre dc 5 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.730
 work for the fifth row 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.700
 to this we add the active situation of the horse 16 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.160
 that could eventually jump to box 7 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.730
 so much to check the black king 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.510
 that is to say that the white pieces 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.490
 they exercise absolute control of the position 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.450
 since all ski those 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.450
 they are in the optimal boxes for the attack 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.940
 if we compare to each of the black pieces 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.760
 with the situation of the white pieces 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.940
 we noticed that both the horse 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.950
 like the bishop and the towers 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.440
 they are in passive position 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.229
 and the factor that further accentuates the weakness of the black position 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.760
 is the range 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.080
 who is helpless in the box 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.740
 of seven 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.860
 the tactical theme that we deal with in this position 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.030
 it's the double attack 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.200
 imagine that the range of f3 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.550
 I could go to the h3 box 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.550
 then latorre dc 5 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.650
 could capture the horse 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.520
 and Black could not capture catriel 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.520
 since the black lady is helpless 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.810
 On the other hand, if Black captures Lady 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.600
 then it appears in our tactical scheme 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.890
 the double attack of the horse 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.900
 in box 7 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.880
 then we can force this situation 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.060
 with a blunt play 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.769
 to 57 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:11.809
 Now Black has two possibilities 

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:15.279
 they captured to throw themselves to the square h 8 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:16.339
 in the first 

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:20.509
 the capture of the bishop leads us to the variant that we had mentioned 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.139
 canache 3 

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:25.449
 again 

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:28.639
 so now it has two possibilities of withdrawal 

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:30.289
 to the g8 box 

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:31.519
 or the box 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:32.569
 10 6 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.659
 but both will be thrown follows the same play 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:37.259
 tower for five 

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:40.259
 and Black is forced to deliver the range 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:43.379
 since the nailing of the pull of ezeiza 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.489
 video capture of the tower 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.239
 already the capture of range follows the play 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.629
 cavallo e7 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.639
 and white win material and with it the game 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.469
 let's see as an example 

00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:59.249
 the identity of the 16th 

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:00.279
 tower by 

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:01.409
 of five 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:02.529
 tama tonga 

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:03.639
 of five 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:04.819
 and every help 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.819
 is 7 

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:15.789
 However 

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:19.949
 Black is not obliged to capture the bishop in h7 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:21.249
 in that case 

00:03:21.249 --> 00:03:24.139
 the plants have the strong play 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:26.109
 to machete 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:27.569
 now black 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.789
 they must defend the point 

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:30.819
 h7 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.429
 playing horse to the g6 

00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:36.749
 now White must be precise in the attack 

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:37.819
 while 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.829
 There are several continuation is that they ensure the gain of material 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:44.199
 an elegant continuation 

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:46.889
 is the next 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:48.119
 h 5 

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:50.159
 Black must capture 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:53.159
 since the attack by the column would be devastating 

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:55.539
 cavallo by h5 

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:57.289
 branch by h5 

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:59.329
 Brenes to add a hole 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:00.809
 through 10 6 

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:03.769
 only play to avoid the mate 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.249
 alfito of 6 

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:07.569
 I will fight 7 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.899
 camacho and 7 

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:11.289
 Peláez is happy 

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:13.589
 we see how the white pieces 

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:17.369
 with each play they progress in the attack and approach victory 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:19.769
 cavallo of five 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.289
 attacking the range 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:22.740
 branch of five 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:23.979
 slowly 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:25.080
 in January 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.059
 is running out of boxes 

00:04:27.059 --> 00:04:30.379
 the only black piece that participates in the defense of headquarters 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.610
 horse makes four 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.939
 out there he can not go to that five because he receives mate 

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:40.939
 by damache zinc 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:43.460
 only play then 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.080
 star of seven 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.800
 now the white lady is incorporated again in the attack 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.319
 the manche 4 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:53.949
 Black can not swear f6 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:56.620
 since they would weaken the seventh row 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.089
 and the action of the lady by h7 in conjunction with the latorre dc one 

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:04.089
 mate 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.039
 neither can they swear that there are seven 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:11.400
 since they receive the double attack 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.400
 by horse to the g6 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.439
 then the juniper must retire to 10 6 

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:21.490
 and now a simple and forceful sworn 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:22.479
 the topic 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:23.870
 e4 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.870
 threatening e 5 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:32.210
 trying to force braña that is going to move to the square of seven 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.949
 the measures are bound to capture 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:38.789
 lady for four and just white play 

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:43.819
 if Black withdraws heredia of seven 

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:46.210
 then they lose the range 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.879
 and if Black plays the eia of five 

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:53.689
 then White has a very strong play that forces the abandonment 

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:55.020
 lama is going 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.610
 with the double threat 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.080
 as much as 6 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.069
 as a lady for seven 

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:01.539
 checkmate 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:02.610
 We have seen 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.839
 as from the initial position 

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:08.879
 the number of attacking pieces will be greater with respect to the number of pieces 

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:10.189
 who defend 

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:11.520
 in this case 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.080
 the attack on the black castling 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.110
 congratulations and you 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.409
 has found the continuation based on the play 

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:21.050
 bishop by h7 check
