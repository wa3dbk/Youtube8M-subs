00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.619
 Today we will have a chat system to 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.270
 so you know so systematically where 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.310
 Getting into multiple sources is easy 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.090
 can go underneath each other 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.099
 can occur 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.720
 of course you can these channels as 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:36.300
 to call one 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:37.910
 for example, the command moment here 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.059
 can be used for example coming 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.469
 channel are happy because something just like that 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.039
 can also have their own channels 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.050
 wait and speak the channel 13 hf 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.809
 for example and to pay only has one 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.670
 small private does vocals can read along 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.750
 now the people by the name of 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.210
 Of course, coaching can be easy 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.430
 make breathing channels and so on 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.580
 Of course, funny does not need it 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.040
 because you already think of james story as too 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.119
 low 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.950
 I already have that as 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.170
 I really want that 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.150
 explain for the reason that I have 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.979
 now a little bit around it belongs 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.200
 originally I did it right 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.930
 find out that yourself 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.360
 a list with more blocked 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.830
 says I received messages and me 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.939
 I did not think about it at all 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.590
 what do you have a lot but basically there is 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.320
 from two classes from a command 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.380
 channel so even a small mail 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.850
 simply write viscom in 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:43.380
 the head and user then you do that 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.640
 register the command 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.710
 the format to excuse , however, the 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.270
 I'll need a whole class 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.829
 explain that out 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.329
 the construction today in principle no 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:59.310
 Escape changed implements it 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.689
 it is said you have to be a player if 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.179
 it should be controlled 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:06.990
 after that is already excluded that 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:09.000
 cache and soloist is that player here 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.760
 The arguments length is checked 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.549
 So use sprinkle play then 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.530
 he gets to turn the wrong game as 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:19.890
 players this is them there wales 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.739
 the fair is already in a panel 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.349
 is inside because I need my here 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.690
 keeps a publics datacash doing her 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.060
 you have to invest with strings strict 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.390
 small ultimately only mister schwab and such 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.680
 could access it the whole time 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.420
 I will give you the source code for 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.599
 of course, because of this 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.760
 because I have nothing illustrated and 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.950
 I love it but here is more 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.989
 we have checked ours once 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.569
 this is hash value herr schmidt 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.120
 saved 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:55.040
 player name for example racer blur and 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.160
 the channel theme in it is for example 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.209
 xy 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.400
 so now everyone is watching when I am 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.620
 the cross uses that means that 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.859
 I am here now the first commercial 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:11.730
 My first argument is that I'm dreaming 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:15.209
 We have the second argument 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:18.600
 channel then it goes to the call that 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:21.510
 is just in usus of one 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:24.569
 channel in with contens tested 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.420
 software both from just inside is when 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:30.139
 nothing there now until then there is me 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.430
 Simply in the whale is a very 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:34.560
 difficult the message yes I am now 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.870
 we are of course with the channel 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.819
 is checked again is cher 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.230
 is I turn off here in the channel 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.419
 can let it 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.630
 If so, then I would just move there 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:47.849
 is otherwise except message 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.989
 to cut a knife you are you 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:51.540
 contains in it 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:55.230
 this error like to leave the whole 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.060
 if none of these then one 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.919
 argument arguments do not apply 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.759
 you should just get one like that 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:04.390
 short help what you can do so from it 

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:08.260
 for stands in principle 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:11.950
 all is not fresh at all required 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:15.040
 command the registered here even 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:19.109
 more so 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:23.220
 which is actually kept simple 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:26.440
 php should be the whole evening of healing water 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.780
 explains to hermes and string kenneth 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.480
 chenault users simply do that by us 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:35.200
 we access the session and the 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:37.990
 players in channel names then pick 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:43.270
 I have all online players from here 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:45.700
 whole is to turn weijl is 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:49.080
 checked if the channel uneven clock 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:51.730
 then resolves all receivers deleted 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:55.750
 that meant me that the player in 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:58.419
 the channel's inside here are used 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.910
 The people inflicted on me that one 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:03.400
 Girls are allowed to run then a loop 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.040
 for every player through for everyone 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.900
 player runs live on the riff 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.320
 server is checked the channel at the same 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.300
 zero 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:14.710
 that would be to play on money in it 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:19.390
 then it is still checked is player to 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:22.780
 example have games like that because he otherwise 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:25.290
 whatever our channel is now 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.940
 said okay passed us five players 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:31.210
 noticed I know wants to know in 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:34.470
 which channels compared with z 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:37.300
 the channel of the receiver 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.770
 and there is something for me to stand 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:43.030
 I hope that everything is fine 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:44.650
 now if ios get apps here 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.729
 we receive all the receipts and this 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:50.599
 new recipients too 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:52.460
 However, a first responder may receive the 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:58.279
 channel that is the global 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:06:00.650
 chats the global will be checking that 

00:05:58.279 --> 00:06:02.809
 players neven that player already 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.479
 in a small in there is no 

00:06:02.809 --> 00:06:10.009
 then delete message scope if easy 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:11.960
 get out of the list i will give you the 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:13.370
 source code online for guidance 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:20.149
 download here 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:22.399
 because needs and here just a little longer 

00:06:20.149 --> 00:06:24.759
 I am looking forward to turning again 

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:27.259
 I hope that the tutorial anyway 

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:31.639
 acceptable because I'll stop it 

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:33.259
 requests of the user optimized and many 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:35.740
 thanks for watching and until the next 

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:35.740
 times
