them<00:00:48.360> private<00:00:48.930> so<00:00:49.620> under<00:00:49.950> visibility<00:00:50.579> I

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
them private so under visibility I

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.150 
them private so under visibility I
simply<00:00:52.590> make<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.800> private

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
simply make it private

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.580

that way it's published it's saved you

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.990 
that way it's published it's saved you
could<00:00:58.710> actually<00:00:58.859> leave<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.190> unpublished<00:00:59.820> and

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
could actually leave it unpublished and

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.630 
could actually leave it unpublished and
just<00:01:00.239> save<00:01:00.449> but<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:01.920> how<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.070> do<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.399> and
