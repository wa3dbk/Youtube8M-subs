wholly-owned<00:01:32.579> save<00:01:33.119> you're<00:01:33.329> doing<00:01:33.540> that

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
wholly-owned save you're doing that

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.920

perceptual<00:01:34.920> larger<00:01:35.340> extent<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:36.390> what<00:01:36.570> we<00:01:36.689> rest

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
perceptual larger extent so what we rest

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.880 
perceptual larger extent so what we rest

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
but anyways so we do see wasted planning

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.740 
but anyways so we do see wasted planning
on<00:01:41.189> his<00:01:41.340> barracks<00:01:41.670> there<00:01:42.079> July's<00:01:43.079> are

verses<00:02:19.580> iris<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:20.360> then<00:02:20.780> that<00:02:20.959> will<00:02:21.110> also<00:02:21.319> be

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
verses iris and then that will also be

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.270 
verses iris and then that will also be
extremely<00:02:21.950> interesting<00:02:22.310> because<00:02:23.980> then<00:02:24.980> if

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
extremely interesting because then if

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.740 
extremely interesting because then if
iris<00:02:25.580> wins<00:02:26.000> he<00:02:26.659> advances<00:02:28.209> wait<00:02:29.209> no<00:02:29.390> I<00:02:29.599> mean

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
iris wins he advances wait no I mean

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.509 
iris wins he advances wait no I mean

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
then if wasted wins sorry if wastin wins

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.059 
then if wasted wins sorry if wastin wins
and<00:02:31.760> he<00:02:31.819> advances<00:02:32.299> and<00:02:32.450> if<00:02:33.079> iris<00:02:33.349> wins<00:02:33.769> then

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
and he advances and if iris wins then

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:35.740

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:24.959 
precious moment in my opinion I said
well<00:05:23.409> probably<00:05:23.560> but<00:05:24.099> wasting<00:05:24.490> that<00:05:24.580> moment

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:24.969 
well probably but wasting that moment

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:27.029 
well probably but wasting that moment
that<00:05:25.090> he<00:05:25.150> needed<00:05:25.389> to<00:05:25.509> kill<00:05:26.020> off<00:05:26.169> those<00:05:26.380> stds<00:05:26.710> he

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 
that he needed to kill off those stds he

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:28.439 
that he needed to kill off those stds he
could<00:05:27.219> have<00:05:27.310> he<00:05:27.669> would<00:05:27.699> have<00:05:27.940> lost<00:05:28.120> some<00:05:28.389> of

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:28.449 
could have he would have lost some of

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:31.649 
could have he would have lost some of
his<00:05:28.569> links<00:05:28.960> to<00:05:29.110> the<00:05:29.229> STDs<00:05:29.650> but<00:05:29.680> um<00:05:30.419> honestly<00:05:31.419> I

00:05:31.649 --> 00:05:31.659 
his links to the STDs but um honestly I

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:33.390 
his links to the STDs but um honestly I
mean<00:05:31.840> he<00:05:32.139> should<00:05:32.620> just<00:05:32.770> sacrifice<00:05:33.190> it<00:05:33.370> for

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
mean he should just sacrifice it for

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.580 
mean he should just sacrifice it for
those<00:05:33.639> stds<00:05:33.909> because<00:05:34.270> now<00:05:34.449> Gleason<00:05:35.289> has<00:05:35.319> only

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
those stds because now Gleason has only

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.399 
those stds because now Gleason has only
lost<00:05:35.830> a<00:05:36.099> few<00:05:36.580> STDs<00:05:36.759> and<00:05:37.389> those<00:05:37.810> firemen<00:05:38.020> even

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:38.409
