previous video I showed you how to make
a<00:00:07.350> bubble<00:00:07.560> bucket<00:00:08.040> what<00:00:09.000> I'm<00:00:09.090> going<00:00:09.210> to<00:00:09.240> show

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
a bubble bucket what I'm going to show

it<00:00:15.750> into<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:15.960> bubble<00:00:16.289> bucket<00:00:16.619> system<00:00:16.830> and

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
it into the bubble bucket system and

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.790 
it into the bubble bucket system and
I've<00:00:17.910> covered<00:00:18.210> it<00:00:18.390> up<00:00:18.510> with<00:00:18.570> hydroton<00:00:19.199> on<00:00:19.680> the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
couple of days of growing and maybe even

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.630 
couple of days of growing and maybe even
the<00:01:16.450> first<00:01:16.510> two<00:01:16.900> weeks<00:01:17.110> this<00:01:18.070> is<00:01:18.130> a<00:01:18.280> turkey

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
the first two weeks this is a turkey

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.150 
the first two weeks this is a turkey
baster<00:01:18.790> what<00:01:19.210> is<00:01:19.330> it<00:01:19.510> for<00:01:19.750> as<00:01:20.350> I<00:01:20.500> actually<00:01:20.680> dip

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
baster what is it for as I actually dip

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.010 
baster what is it for as I actually dip
the<00:01:21.730> turkey<00:01:22.060> baster<00:01:22.210> in<00:01:22.510> the<00:01:22.600> nutrient

the turkey baster in the nutrient

the turkey baster in the nutrient
solution<00:01:23.440> and<00:01:23.650> then<00:01:24.190> I<00:01:24.220> just<00:01:24.520> can't

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
solution and then I just can't

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.640 
solution and then I just can't
I<00:01:26.490> just<00:01:27.000> go<00:01:27.180> around<00:01:27.330> I'm<00:01:27.750> wasting<00:01:28.170> up<00:01:28.290> all<00:01:28.500> of

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
I just go around I'm wasting up all of

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.530 
I just go around I'm wasting up all of
the<00:01:28.740> hydrogen<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.370> area<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:30.120> it'd<00:01:30.420> make

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
the hydrogen in the area and it'd make

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.230 
the hydrogen in the area and it'd make
life<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.930> little<00:01:31.080> bit<00:01:31.230> easier<00:01:31.290> on<00:01:31.620> my<00:01:31.830> fingers

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
life a little bit easier on my fingers

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.880 
life a little bit easier on my fingers
I've<00:01:33.240> had<00:01:33.510> big<00:01:33.720> results<00:01:34.110> with<00:01:34.260> this<00:01:34.380> before

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
I've had big results with this before

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.920 
I've had big results with this before
but<00:01:35.160> I<00:01:35.220> do<00:01:35.340> advise<00:01:35.730> against<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.300> not<00:01:36.570> getting

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
but I do advise against is not getting

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.230 
but I do advise against is not getting
it<00:01:37.020> on<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.230> leaves<00:01:37.440> I<00:01:37.800> would<00:01:38.790> go<00:01:38.910> through<00:01:39.120> to

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
it on the leaves I would go through to

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.000 
it on the leaves I would go through to
do<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:39.540> once<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.990> twice<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.260> day<00:01:40.530> or<00:01:40.710> as<00:01:40.830> you

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
do this once to twice a day or as you

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.860 
do this once to twice a day or as you
have<00:01:41.160> time<00:01:41.460> it's<00:01:41.700> not<00:01:41.850> necessary<00:01:42.450> but<00:01:42.630> again

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
have time it's not necessary but again

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.230 
have time it's not necessary but again
it's<00:01:43.020> probably<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.380> good<00:01:43.500> idea

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
it's probably a good idea

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.000 
it's probably a good idea
it's<00:01:45.600> also<00:01:45.780> good<00:01:46.050> not<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.350> soak<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:46.890> that

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
it's also good not to soak it so that

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.740 
it's also good not to soak it so that
you<00:01:47.070> come<00:01:47.220> around<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.580> roots<00:01:47.790> which<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.600> why

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
you come around the roots which is why

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.690 
you come around the roots which is why
we<00:01:48.930> left<00:01:49.080> the<00:01:49.170> water<00:01:49.410> of<00:01:49.619> them<00:01:49.770> an<00:01:50.130> inch<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.670> two

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
we left the water of them an inch to two

inside of the bucket okay so other than
that<00:01:58.080> just<00:01:58.680> for<00:01:59.610> your<00:01:59.700> seedlings<00:02:00.180> until<00:02:00.690> they
