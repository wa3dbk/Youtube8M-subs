00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:14.309
 of luxury crochet was sleeping in 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.689

 betting on the high lingerie of the home 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.640

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.829
 to see if they illustrate me and that my grandmother does not 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.550
 have to say that what a shame 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:29.550
 boy 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.399
 Barbara this bedding is already very 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.320
 hard to get because this is the 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.239
 that we had in our homes 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.370
 grandmothers and what material is made 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:47.989
 is today we have two cotton and one 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.879
 which is the luxury that is finished in satin 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.659
 but it is not greasy it is cotton what happens 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:56.899
 that the feeling sensation is like satin and 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:57.860
 then the normal Egyptian cotton and 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.289
 current 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.329
 so normal Egyptian cotton and 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.369
 current that compared to cotton 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.020
 that we have then it is not so normal and 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.929
 avant-garde although yes normal and current 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.300
 Egyptian cotton is a super cotton 

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:13.909
 soft cool and ironing gc nam in 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.289
 'then clear I see that you work all 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.420
 the sheets with these details so 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:21.319
 fantastic and done is by embroidery 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.899
 this all carriers and cut the fabric 

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:27.549
 we cut it if it is sent to embroider we have 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:27.549
 a wide sample of embroideries 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.540
 this is the most expensive because it looks 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.180
 all the buttons that you have one by one you 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.060
 embroider the hole the same object and 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.310
 fantastic flame in a group is how it was 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.350
 everything before these are prepared 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.800
 normally to address initials that 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.450
 people like embroidery initials 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.190
 It is always very personalized and 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.620
 drawings you have based on designs 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.020
 ancient and ancient collecting this is 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.660
 one of the best selling if it's what 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.610
 what else thibodeau sells that I do not know if 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.930
 I expose it in sanÃ¡ will have very 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.509
 different because I think the jobs 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.100
 yes they are distinguished and if in one you can 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.259
 take many more hours than other 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.580
 then they are the simplest they are worth 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:15.950
 from 100 euros to 200 depending on the 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.840
 embroidery and the size of the clear bed that 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.850
 will make the beds are huge clear 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.100
 then the embroidery is one more meter 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.660
 easily embroidery and like the rest of 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.940
 your proposal I imagine that also 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.550
 you can customize it if I 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:32.540
 I bring a design of my own to my grandmother 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.310
 that he replied replicate yes and with 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.019
 the old sheets that we have 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.960
 we can do something grand 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.260
 new one occurs to you 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.250
 Well look at the old sheets as they are 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.620
 small because the old cameras 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.780
 will be the small ones usually the 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.580
 we convert into duvet covers as per 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.270
 example I teach you one of baby that what 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.270
 we do in baby 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.439
 is the old sheet would go around here and 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.500
 open the embozo and here we would 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:03.320
 the filling is already laid 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.150
 and then it looks like it's a 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.400
 sheet with bedspread 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.790
 in summer and if it's winter you get the 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.370
 fill and you have left a Nordic so you 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:17.300
 we can give a second life to this guy 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:20.180
 of manual works that all come to him 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.820
 in his dead closet of barbara laugh I see 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.710
 that you can have here are a 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.350
 very modern design although ready-made 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.720
 in a traditional way we look 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.730
 of the buttons of a lifetime that this 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.120

 always with current designs and our 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:50.090
 monkeys and is cotton so good at 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:56.030
 Cotton is the best because embroidery is very 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:57.560
 expensive and very chubby very thick cotton 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.150

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.400

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.350

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.440

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.300

 a bathtub for my husband for example 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:19.130

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:22.010

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.950

 special care with these beaches to the 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.350
 time to put the nation to the best it says 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.960
 the manufacturer that needs to be done is to wash 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:00.090
 the washer without softener and dry that 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.450
 board and is how they are more fluffy 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.580
 and more absorbent and softener over 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:09.210
 everything in madrid or the water of the 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:11.760
 harder waters, but not the water of 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.440
 Madrid for example without softener and with 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.560
 dryer and they stay spongy and 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:20.460
 there are also trends in the high 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:23.160
 Lingerie for the place of colors 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.690
 yes yes the colors more or less if what 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.310
 it happens that there are always classics that 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.760
 those never go out of style that are these 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:32.220
 colors and grays the beige and then 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.490
 above all the white the white is the 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.740
 color of all life and that because people 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.490
 that just wants white to make them look 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.490
