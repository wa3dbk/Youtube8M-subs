00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.160

 connoisseur of the call 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.470
 but those guys could fly so I thought something different from the eighth time 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.609
 then just shoot the town, actually I knew that 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:30.199

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.050
 No 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.610

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.400

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.420
 answer 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.420
 but telefonica van raaij 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.980
 why p started ful 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.160
 and he has the idea that you get so much sitcom to the grant too 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.470
 thanks to Jan the rider at least 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.290
 the last 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.670
 in 2000 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.900
 maybe twice pigeons 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.590
 well well i actually started to pass by i thought you were what i am going for 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.370
 they turn 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.370
 just myself some clips rebellious the computer sold last year 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.180
 and therefore count the image culture I have nothing that it falls clips 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.980
 saves 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.810
 and i didn't know he did a youtube because i had i had it earlier 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.400
 also the musicians to a bmx bicycles percent 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.800
 I just thought it was with now 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.030
 Danes you know what it throws just bam on YouTube an opportunity that we see again 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.010
 when I experience something greasy or something or the funniest 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.630
 so a bit opposed to a the subscribers union of seemingly fun 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.680
 to point to playing 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.390
 that's how it went a bit 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.750
 aim old games from the past that 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.020
 the new known well so I am still at stake 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.280
 intend and that is mel form he leads a sold because pronounce it well 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.640
 empty dec asked what happened with his speed and the commodities law 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.740
 the 113 i think is that is 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.250
 that about ten years ago, senna boys state last year 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.259
 for people who want to keep up with 22 were 23 

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:16.079
 wanted to find out 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:17.379
 come together 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.889
 I am going to do it there with the toppers in between too quickly so clearly 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:24.979
 are you good at it and want to see a man with a weapon ready 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:27.559
 well i have more 

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:31.739
 with arjen you know me by days the one time i have poured a kind of enlarged 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.179
 ticht miss everything because it is a tribute to the nice mess ANP 

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:40.109
 so that differs a bit slightly also part according to preud'homme I can 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:44.309
 always difficult to set a threat 66 that position different from that there 

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:47.779
 Do you think that I am right 

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:51.179
 the observers not really super good though 

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:55.139
 just normal I don't think good and not bad just normal 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:59.749
 therefore it does not make a thick lesson to read the shrinkage allows the vaccinations 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:02.929
 and 

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:06.449
 we also have water police ever from the aica or end is 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:10.909
 and the aker 5 7 and the arp in chili of course 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:17.449
 jan nieuwenburg you play with cebs then i dont get i already have a regular club 

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:21.019
 and I just want to keep it a bit from being partly forced into that 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.349
 sooooo rich yes now I will not release anything anyway 

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:27.639
 but also completely satisfied 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:30.819
 and that is just more for safety reasons 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.599
 the dutch editors the empire 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:36.309
 i wouldn't know boy 

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:39.429
 I am sure if it is going to say that I am wrong to say it is likely 

00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:42.519
 it the men i guess my pay goes to slaughterhouse 

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:45.020
 Grandpa higher Bruges 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.599
 how can you get started 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.439
 you go later also no can the virus too 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:53.120
 on behalf of this year I am therefore planning on the criticism and management of you 

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:54.839
 hear the atmosphere 

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:57.839
 then we can kind of keep that guy and the frendzy 

00:03:58.399 --> 00:04:00.069
 and I probably have with them 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.029
 seems to me to do things with the money that we will be one of them who 

00:04:03.029 --> 00:04:04.579
 reminded and then 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:07.029
 hopefully one open and then 

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:11.089
 go is the craziest dish that we can do that day and that goes the way 

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:14.149
 recorders that becomes quotes that will certainly happen anyway 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:19.690
 but not in terms of and teamspeak that just can't be, unfortunately that's over time 

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:24.499
 then the tour was just a century old public life 

00:04:24.499 --> 00:04:28.500
 being able to do in a nice job it's a nice job 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.650
 and reactor crazy afternoon 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.800
 so I searched the subtopper for eleven hours 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.189
 who is those clubs 

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:37.240
 I'm going m 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.150
 in order to do so you must do it 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.360
 but you only hear that later placed on these containers 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.050
 but that doesn't matter 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.159
 i go tour 

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:49.159
 so the head to be ashamed of we live in the brewery 

00:04:49.809 --> 00:04:54.309
 in through my retirement we also ask as a human being the name come promotex 

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:57.309
 after a school for a dozen content so that is very simple 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:02.169
 and thyme trump pellÃ¨ trump fairly complete 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:03.190
 antwerp 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.629

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:07.379
 tommy intimates 

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:08.349
 Yes 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:11.979
 what exactly are you going to do team it just a little better just ask after 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:15.150
 this said three is teamspeak ready 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.770
 you do have a medical grumble effect this year's amg aerospace core in the 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.309
 I am going to be able to do fish in the future so that will be good on a robine from 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:26.839
 3 

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:30.340
 and there ask questions about their profession where times like that of your club's gool 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.710
 from the internet 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.289
 it rarely 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:37.110
 in the future this everberg will be very happy don't think so because the image 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.749
 that will be a bit like that by that time 

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:41.789
 that also applies to the 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:44.409
 and what do you like the most about youtube 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:48.989

00:05:48.989 --> 00:05:51.099

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:53.809
 a bit all the people who seemed to be in it and and that started 

00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:56.719
 I like that again all kinds of people 

00:05:56.719 --> 00:06:01.139
 all mongolian and hairy guests and seems to be wicked once a disturbed and 

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:05.029
 all ages also the 

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:08.740
 You will learn a lot from it without actually having to worry 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.069
 get to know a lot of people people know sports 

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:14.860
 so that is also possible 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.150
 and it was just a return 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.770
 I help you liked it and you ask yourself again under a cloth 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.270
 maybe one more time 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.369
 In the meantime it will be fine if a convincing slit runs the day 

00:06:27.369 --> 00:06:28.159
 then docu
