00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
up the escalator up the steps and then

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.889 
up the escalator up the steps and then
figure<00:00:52.350> out<00:00:52.850> which<00:00:53.850> line<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.329> want<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.629> get<00:00:54.750> on

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
figure out which line you want to get on

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.660 
figure out which line you want to get on
here<00:00:55.230> in<00:00:55.289> my<00:00:55.320> case<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:55.890> want<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.129> get<00:00:56.309> on<00:00:56.460> the

west<00:01:38.190> well<00:01:38.580> the<00:01:38.759> traffic<00:01:38.970> died<00:01:39.390> down<00:01:39.600> some<00:01:39.990> so

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
west well the traffic died down some so

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.730 
west well the traffic died down some so
I<00:01:40.290> can<00:01:40.619> navigate<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.940> hallway<00:01:42.450> here<00:01:42.899> if

here and the signage right up there

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.550 
here and the signage right up there
maybe<00:04:16.580> the<00:04:16.790> subways<00:04:17.150> don't<00:04:17.450> run<00:04:17.690> quite<00:04:18.320> as

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
maybe the subways don't run quite as

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.140 
maybe the subways don't run quite as
frequently<00:04:18.770> you<00:04:19.220> might<00:04:19.400> have<00:04:19.550> to<00:04:19.670> wait<00:04:19.760> two

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
frequently you might have to wait two

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.250 
frequently you might have to wait two
three<00:04:21.080> more<00:04:21.260> minutes<00:04:21.530> longer<00:04:22.930> relative<00:04:23.930> to

catching your next subway or train here
so<00:04:28.280> I<00:04:28.640> think<00:04:29.060> something

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
so I think something

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.719 
so I think something
and<00:04:31.259> I<00:04:31.650> think<00:04:31.860> they're<00:04:32.009> announcing<00:04:32.220> something

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
and I think they're announcing something

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.540 

this<00:05:01.650> will<00:05:01.830> be<00:05:01.949> the<00:05:02.069> one<00:05:02.189> on<00:05:02.250> the<00:05:02.430> other

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
this will be the one on the other

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:19.210 
this will be the one on the other
platform<00:05:02.879> first

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.330 

it's<00:05:20.220> a<00:05:20.370> Saturday<00:05:20.819> afternoon<00:05:21.199> and<00:05:22.199> nice<00:05:23.100> and

it's a Saturday afternoon and nice and

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.980 
it's a Saturday afternoon and nice and
crowded<00:05:23.699> here<00:05:23.880> so<00:05:24.360> this<00:05:24.479> is<00:05:24.630> probably<00:05:24.900> like

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
crowded here so this is probably like

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:30.920 
crowded here so this is probably like
the<00:05:25.819> NGO<00:05:27.979> Shibuya<00:05:28.979> and<00:05:29.370> Tokyo<00:05:30.150> stations<00:05:30.720> as

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
the NGO Shibuya and Tokyo stations as

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.839 
the NGO Shibuya and Tokyo stations as
far<00:05:31.169> as<00:05:32.360> major<00:05:34.009> transfer<00:05:35.009> point<00:05:35.370> for<00:05:35.460> people

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:35.849 
far as major transfer point for people

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:39.820 
far as major transfer point for people
coming<00:05:36.000> and<00:05:36.330> going<00:05:36.690> all<00:05:37.229> over<00:05:37.710> the<00:05:38.699> poro<00:05:39.000> here

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
coming and going all over the poro here

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:45.170 
coming and going all over the poro here
so<00:05:41.539> if<00:05:42.539> that<00:05:42.750> train<00:05:43.110> came<00:05:43.560> in<00:05:43.800> from<00:05:44.180> that

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
so if that train came in from that

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.850 
so if that train came in from that
direction

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
direction

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.580 
direction
I<00:05:47.099> figure<00:05:47.490> the<00:05:47.639> next<00:05:47.880> one<00:05:48.090> will<00:05:48.810> be<00:05:48.840> coming<00:05:49.169> in

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
I figure the next one will be coming in

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.850 
I figure the next one will be coming in
from<00:05:50.070> here<00:05:50.639> it<00:05:50.910> comes<00:05:51.199> so<00:05:52.199> if<00:05:52.259> you<00:05:52.410> hustle<00:05:52.830> you

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
from here it comes so if you hustle you

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.200 
from here it comes so if you hustle you
can<00:05:53.250> make<00:05:53.940> the<00:05:54.090> connections<00:05:54.630> here<00:05:55.820> yeah<00:05:56.880> stay

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:24.370 

this

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:24.380 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.389 

and<00:06:25.380> my<00:06:25.710> brains<00:06:25.980> here<00:06:26.400> all<00:06:26.880> aboard
