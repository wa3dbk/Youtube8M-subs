00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.470
 great hello everyone is glad to see you on 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.690
 my channel and this year I decided to start 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.490
 with a video that will be dedicated to my 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.620
 the best facial care 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.810
 These are the products on which I 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.619
 stopped trying before them a bunch 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.569
 other means are those products that 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:26.419
 do not perform the stated functions that 

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:26.960
 I fit in and in general that me 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:30.109
 like 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.029
 and start i want you the most important thing for 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.350
 Me means this means for cleansing 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:38.510
 facial skin and it 's about this 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:41.359
 cleansing foaming cream from the company 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.340
 uyazh I have such a large amount of two 

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:45.710
 reasons the first reason is because we have 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.769
 it's quite difficult to find this tool in 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.480
 pharmacies and the second reason is the pump 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:52.219
 which is on top because 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.140
 there is no such small amount of pump 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.289
 small volume this tool looks 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.420
 something like this 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:01.489
 tube with cream that is necessary manually 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.610
 squeeze the cap tighten and so 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.830
 Further , I considered that funds with 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.900
 ass will be much more convenient applications 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.150
 In general, this tool is intended for 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.480
 sensitive skin vulnerable skin 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:17.000
 newborn children adults and and can 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.400
 clean not only the face but also the body i 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.340
 decided to encrypt the composition specified 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.650
 on packaging here comes first 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.290
 thermal water further various 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.330
 substances that differ 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.220
 moistening foam is not here 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.460
 contains soap and parabens 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.710
 he is hypoallergenic for this reason he and 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.320
 suitable for newborns only 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.350
 what I don't really like here is 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.770
 he has a smell 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:48.260
 perfume it is something like washing 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.840
 powder at me I have such feelings 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.450
 I have such associations, but I have this 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.380
 the smell is not scary otherwise it is not 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.780
 remedy this cream really like it 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:03.590
 perfectly cleans the skin of the face it washes away 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.870
 make-up with a bang 1 2 maximum washing 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:10.119
 enough to completely wash away everything and 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:12.519
 keep your face completely creaky 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.129
 it even flushes out the pores ie dirt and 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.379
 the dispute takes off just do not know how miracle 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:19.450
 there seems to be no aggressive 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:21.720
 components there is this most gentle glue but 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.690
 here is why it works like this 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.790
 they are very happy to squint now 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.730
 and peer name unnecessary 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.610
 means the name of these means is more correct 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.440
 leave everything under the video so you can 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.739
 just see how big it looks 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.700
 packing the pump on top is very convenient and in 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.950
 In general, I can advise you 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.900
 really cool cool tool 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.739
 the next one i will show you 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:51.459
 it's a product of the company's plants 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:53.709
 I bought it while still in Thailand 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:57.040
 such a kind of cream-gel with granules 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:03:00.030
 which is designed to remove greasy 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.739
 face films for face matting for 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.959
 final cleansing so let's say before 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:08.680
 how i bought my cleansing cream from 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:10.569
 Uriage I this cream-gel used them 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.000
 quite often because even after 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.530
 washing after removing cosmetics all 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.750
 even on the face remains some such 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.090
 fatty film and this tool 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.660
 which by the way is called oil 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.569
 control 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.609
 she allowed to remove everything completely everything 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.700
 pollution and leave your face clean 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:30.370
 creaking matte and this matte effect 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.549
 quite a long time and with the advent of 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.530
 cream from uyajazh this tool I now 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:37.750
 I use a little less because in it 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.760
 no need but i can 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.280
 advise it for girls with skin 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.199
 prone to fat I think that's 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.560
 the tool will really be a boon and 

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:52.000
 Generally in principle upon with if you find 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:54.459
 this brand has her entire line dedicated 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.480
 care washing and so on very very 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.220
 good quality 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.699
 then I want to show you this 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.730
 mask from willow pure system is deep 

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:05.829
 acne cleansing mask 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.109
 I learned them after watching a video about Veronique 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:11.139
 niku camera nick hello thank you 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:13.720
 great and what I want to say about 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:15.310
 this mask I have this mask left 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.060
 literally just a little bit on one 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.489
 application 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.530
 i love to use it and because 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.430
 after her skin I have very gentle very 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:29.160
 smooth it since the rubber is that it 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:31.990
 fresh and breathing skin breathes want 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:35.130
 breathe deeply and so feeling 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:39.940
 what after using this mask 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:41.500
 as if removed a whole layer of dirt and in 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.750
 overall really very pleasant 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.080
 feeling after it remains of course 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.729
 it says that the mask is against acne and 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:53.500
 I can definitely say that with acne 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:55.060
 it is unlikely to help you and hardly this 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.790
 the mask will remove all acne 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.840
 but nevertheless precisely because of the purification 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.570
 such a good 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:05.229
 I think that acne will quietly 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:07.090
 decrease and less likelihood that they 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:10.000
 you will have if you will be right 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.650
 care for your skin well and completion 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.050
 the entire facial treatment after 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.330
 all kinds of cleansing masks and other things 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.040
 I almost always use 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.440
 moisturizer because unfortunately 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:23.560
 my skin without additional moisturizing 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.840
 Feels bad lately I 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.150
 I use just such a cream and this 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.880
 aftershave cream with vitamin f from 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:33.100
 factories freedom I can say that for my 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.220
 very little money this cream 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.240
 really works, he has 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.760
 anti-inflammatory action he 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:42.760
 moisturizes and tones the skin contains 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:45.130
 vitamin f and menthol and when you apply 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:48.780
 this cream is due to menthol feeling 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:50.830
 such that your skin has become taut she 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.500
 really getting some more 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:57.550
 elastic more hydrated and me very 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:59.950
 like these sensations i use it with 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.330
 great pleasure plus this cream 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.070
 and my husband began to use and 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:06.220
 indeed his skin also became 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:08.200
 more rubber and in general I 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:10.240
 really happy and really want you 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:13.870

 it so happens that I am all the time 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.820
 I return to these means 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.310

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:33.830
 my skin and work best for me with
