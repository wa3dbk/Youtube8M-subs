00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:11.389
 Hello UTB crazy Arthur lies 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.710
 the third video from such a small cycle 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.590
 on bends at will call 2 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.060
 this time we will develop cheers for Lanka 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.279
 and in general, if you think so about cards 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:27.269
 applicable to for per tops that is 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.820
 the card on it is the worst which is better then i am not 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.500
 I can select a certain some 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.239
 a card that's right for this tank 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.040
 absolutely not suitable because 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.520
 despite the fact that 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.820
 nominal heavy that is one of 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.680
 few heavy tanks on 4 levels then 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.059
 There is such a class of technology unusual 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:52.739
 quite recently appeared as a matter of fact 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:55.980
 competitor is a german too tanchik soul 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:00.570
 would luxury vagin here somehow so 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:04.019
 read the case but there the car gets to 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:07.790
 fives the same level of battles as if 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.970
 only one four we fall therefore 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:15.119
 seemingly carry what Golda ie 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:18.500
 The first is probably that they will pay attention 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.880
 term ban 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.860
 actually watch this video for what 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.409
 I have six months charged although she is here 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.240
 not necessarily really that is 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.340
 me life chocolates because tank 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.520
 It can ignite it on the sides of the tanks 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.150
 plus the back of the engine and often get into 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.800
 surrounded by 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.900
 that sometimes three things sometimes require 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.870
 the situation is still we have to be ready 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:46.570
 to fire and sin gold it is iron 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:48.850
 it is necessary so than here perk cleanliness and order 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.360
 it is not necessary to download a certain transmission 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.190
 you have no so here is the beginning at all 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.000
 talk about gold shells why 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:00.160
 corner yes very simple to fill 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.980
 some exchange ustatku on this tank 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.710
 you will have a lot of damage 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.930
 kill but in such battles very often 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:12.400
 It turns out the situation when the problem is 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:15.070
 that you don't really miss the skill 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.300
 not that there is a lack of opportunity there 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:21.820
 just for the fact that you can't there on 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.350
 shoot and either fall down and it happens that you 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.360
 just do not have time that is 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.270
 really when you start rush 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.890
 You understood to arrange 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.340
 real advantage on the map especially in 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.200
 sand 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.080
 one such successful is enough 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.980
 Rush we already made pain account 53 in the beginning 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.410
 but broke 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.610
 the main pack of great enemies and 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.500
 left a few inhale 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.440
 yes you can say of course here you can 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.130
 on suspenders to solve but when it comes 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.890
 about especially 2 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.170
 if they need that further 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.790
 promotion of our forces is not a problem then 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.190
 have we crush our 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.560
 the team all shoot at our light 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.960
 notebooks just melts even if they are not 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.870
 punch as many guns on them cause 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.040
 pendant shots that they are just early or 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.110
 late come true that is 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.270
 or will even auto-aim shoot and 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.490
 anyway flooded so you need both 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.330
 you can quickly kill opponents 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.150
 damage 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.650
 you can kill at least a little bit of those 12 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.620
 shots but you did at home 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.380
 mean some already benefited them 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.210
 a little bit sweetly crawled up such 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.730
 often have to use a 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:28.130
 potential that is really could 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.960
 discharge the women a little bit 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.360
 through sniper and punch 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.400
 almost all opponents at the level and 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.960
 while there but half the bull to carry 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.180
 head road for the most engineers 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.790
 mountain boots Hager rest 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.740
 Baba Hami and I tried 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.050
 ride the gods here I am usually there 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.600
 where there were about 25 shells your 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.560
 first they stood at the main angle with us 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.780
 mostly at an angle to 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.870
 but then I realized what really to 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.280
 talk tormented with switching miracle there 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.740
 unexpectedly sometimes when they run out 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.450
 gold shells remain in the head in 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.470
 general to avoid such moments i 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.320
 scored flu gold 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.710
 not so important this fountain of 40 to 30 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:09.170
 thousand is easier for me to just own all 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.150
 zaparivatsya not scatter when shooting 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.190
 the flow here is such a su-85b 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.810
 which by the way once handouts you can not 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.030
 punch in the distance when you hit 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.250
 hull kick felling there everything comes but 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.190
 vyselivat here it is a small bug 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.560
 it is not serious therefore water with 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.290
 avtopotsella especially cute salt on any 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.270
 the distance will be much more effective 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.390
 fire 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.820
 which is probably shown in this fight plus 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.050
 shooting on the go well that's all 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.820
 offset by a relatively good 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.090
 good cable of its level breaking through 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.560
 gold shells plus due to the fact that 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.560
 good recharge even if you donâ€™t 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.390
 hit one two three four times all 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.810
 Equally it justifies the fact that you 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:52.160
 move and it's harder for you to get there and 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.580
 harder to inflict on you 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:58.940
 after all, even considering the fact that the basement tanchik 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:01.520
 quite invulnerable at his level he 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.440
 still has many points on 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.900
 to which enemies will wear 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.450
 throat and honestly i don't really want 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.840
 telling how to destroy on care 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.410
 bo2 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:14.150
 that is, I know the method but read 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.000
 I don't really want to talk about them 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.190
 told essentially watched this video 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:24.400
 or so I will disassemble on this 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:27.290
 tank therefore will not be here but for now all 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:30.100
 my groups voted in contact that 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:32.990
 want a video on the body glonass document 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:35.870
 more by voting well back up at &amp; t 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:39.230
 343 I do not remember exactly and I will forget, and I 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:42.110
 I put it off for later; well, I didn't forget about 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:44.300
 him and made before the seca who liked 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.190
 like and subscribe to my 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.740
 channel write in the comments do you want 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.250
 more vidos on this tank and we 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.500
 Timur 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:54.200
 maybe even all along with the site we 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:57.130
 roll a little more and bend over makita 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:59.630
 successful demonstration fights I can you 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.900
 demonstrate on your channel to everyone

 good luck
