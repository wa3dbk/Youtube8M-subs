00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
component to it but I think if you start

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:54.849 
component to it but I think if you start
whittling<00:03:53.450> down<00:03:53.629> sports<00:03:54.169> to<00:03:54.409> that's<00:03:54.650> the<00:03:54.799> only

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
whittling down sports to that's the only

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.770 
whittling down sports to that's the only
element<00:03:55.459> then<00:03:55.669> you<00:03:55.879> start<00:03:56.209> saying<00:03:56.389> okay<00:03:56.629> it's

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
element then you start saying okay it's

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.899 
element then you start saying okay it's
football<00:03:56.959> more<00:03:57.530> of<00:03:57.739> a<00:03:57.799> sport<00:03:58.159> than<00:03:58.310> hockey<00:03:58.669> or
