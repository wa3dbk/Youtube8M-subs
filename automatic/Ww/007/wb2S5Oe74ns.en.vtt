00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:11.569 
that would normally slide around your
drawer<00:04:10.620> you<00:04:10.799> know<00:04:10.829> when<00:04:11.040> you<00:04:11.129> open<00:04:11.430> and<00:04:11.549> close

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
drawer you know when you open and close

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.009 
drawer you know when you open and close
that<00:04:11.939> all<00:04:12.030> your<00:04:12.150> nail<00:04:12.269> polishes<00:04:12.629> go<00:04:12.750> to<00:04:12.810> the

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
that all your nail polishes go to the

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.170 
that all your nail polishes go to the
back<00:04:13.200> or<00:04:13.500> get<00:04:13.620> items<00:04:13.890> roll<00:04:14.129> around<00:04:14.250> so<00:04:15.030> this

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
back or get items roll around so this

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.640 
back or get items roll around so this
holds<00:04:15.750> them<00:04:16.019> in<00:04:16.199> place

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
holds them in place

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.590 
holds them in place
I<00:04:16.919> wouldn't<00:04:17.459> recommend<00:04:17.609> stacking<00:04:18.359> up<00:04:18.479> a

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
I wouldn't recommend stacking up a

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.029 
I wouldn't recommend stacking up a
million<00:04:18.930> things<00:04:19.169> cuz<00:04:19.380> then<00:04:19.500> again<00:04:19.769> it<00:04:19.919> gets

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
million things cuz then again it gets

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:21.289 
million things cuz then again it gets
lost<00:04:20.250> and<00:04:20.519> you<00:04:20.609> don't<00:04:20.789> know<00:04:20.850> what<00:04:21.000> you<00:04:21.090> have

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
lost and you don't know what you have

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.540 
lost and you don't know what you have
this<00:04:21.780> one<00:04:22.019> is<00:04:22.169> a<00:04:22.199> little<00:04:22.350> bit<00:04:22.560> more<00:04:22.949> empty<00:04:23.250> and

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
this one is a little bit more empty and

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.879 
this one is a little bit more empty and
it's<00:04:23.699> just<00:04:23.850> a<00:04:23.940> blank<00:04:24.240> canvas<00:04:24.720> so<00:04:25.260> again<00:04:25.560> if<00:04:25.800> you

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
it's just a blank canvas so again if you

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:28.310 
it's just a blank canvas so again if you
had<00:04:26.039> a<00:04:26.070> taller<00:04:26.430> drawer<00:04:26.970> you<00:04:27.270> could<00:04:27.449> maybe<00:04:27.630> put

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
had a taller drawer you could maybe put

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.070 
had a taller drawer you could maybe put
