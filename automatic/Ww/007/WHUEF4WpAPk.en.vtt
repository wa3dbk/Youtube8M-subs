00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.380
 Hello dear friends with you super 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.770
 gator 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.859
 This video reviews mods on gta sanandres 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:25.890
 and today we have a mod that allows 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:27.359
 we hold two at once in two 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.019
 weapons 1 types 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.289
 that is, if earlier we could hold two 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:38.250
 crop cut 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:39.870
 two conventional pistols 9 9 millimeter 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.059
 now we can keep perfectly 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.539
 all weapons in hand 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.710
 that is, we can hold two types of weapons 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:55.500
 and desert eagle as we can see 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:57.210
 we can and keep two mp5 while 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.460
 again we can see that the speed 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:05.270
 shooting also increases everything is not 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:09.270
 just like that you can hold in your hands 2 m m 4 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:13.320
 can also see what we are putting 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:16.229
 great damage to the enemies but it is still you 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.909
 will show and sniper rifle we to 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.070
 Unfortunately we can not shoot with two hands 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.110
 but it is in principle and so impossible 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.710
 we can shoot from two hands with two 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.229
 miniguns that's really cool we can 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.079
 see sight goes almost beyond the edges 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:36.630
 monitor 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:40.259
 so but all here you can keep all kinds 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:43.590
 weapons except sniper rifle and 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.170
 of course the grenade and the henchmen there 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.549
 means like a rolled baseball bat then 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.140
 there is only a firearm now 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:54.720
 let's see how it all looks 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:02:01.729
 on fire we shoot as we can see 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:03.979
 desert eagle we have power even if we 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:07.759
 we shoot from two hands 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.759
 let's try again 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.590
 as we can see, kind of like we brought 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:19.510
 car before the explosion yes yes it is 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:21.640
 now let's look at mp5 how he 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:26.020
 shoots and I was shot down 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:29.470
 let's shoot at the cops with how well 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.060
 You can also see one charge from 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.720
 one charge was enough to 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.990
 bring the car to self-destruction 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:40.240
 now let 's get the most delicious m4 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:44.350
 let's see how it can bring the car 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:47.380
 there are even 50 rounds left for the explosion 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.810
 next let's try to blow 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.209
 motorcycle 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.709
 Well, a single charge of these two machines 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.380
 enough to blow two 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.900
 cars so now let's 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.720
 No, this is the most delicious minigun 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:07.420
 let's 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:10.990
 have fun now let's arrange on all of you ah 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:14.880
 yes the sight is really cool like this 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:18.700
 the whole screen unfolds and of course 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.530
 because of this we cannot exactly lead 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.110
 shooting 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.980
 this is the main disadvantage of this type 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.660
 minigun 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:31.090
 something that we can't shoot exactly 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:36.600
 because the patron flies into different 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:41.489
 parties but still very cool so 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.489
 let's try to undermine a helicopter 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.690
 By the way, for some reason I donâ€™t have 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:53.130
 endless ammo though i'm completely 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:57.610
 went through the game this is interesting so no 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:59.470
 I don't have endless ammo 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.610
 get out of here quickly now we 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.130
 die but in principle do not worry 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.670
 weapons still the same let's 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:10.690
 From the wild we will shoot a little deagle too 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:14.140
 I'll run too 1 one charge is enough for 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:16.519
 order to blow up cars so well 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:22.069
 not oh 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:28.069
 of course the best in my weapon 

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:29.650
 for shooting people it's mp5 and that's it 

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:37.330
 we were killed 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:40.550
 motokow well 5 stars 5 stars so 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:43.310
 let's have some more fun and review 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:47.000
 Fashion finish because again, especially 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:53.289
 nothing to tell about him like this 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:55.789
 let's go have some fun 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:59.210
 of course in gta now you have fun nip 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:00.159
 especially like watch dogs or gta 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.889
 four 

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:07.699
 because here in pursuit it looks very 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:09.430
 boring but maybe not boring 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:12.590
 just for some 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.599
 student who has very weak 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.530
 computers and he can only play 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:21.110
 samp and usually gta san andreas 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:26.389
 so by the way in the car with us again 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:29.270
 but only one machine but a second hope 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:33.800
 hand but it does not use the principle of it 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:36.469
 don't need anyway cool oh oh how we 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:40.099
 good speed on this bike 

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:42.440
 something seems to me that in standard 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:44.180
 etaki he is not such a speed apparently 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:48.130
 this is a bug again this fashion again 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:54.039
 which I surveyed past last time 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:56.900
 so well, it seems to me that it is time again 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:59.330
 make a pogrom here with a minigun 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:03.380
 that's the way to shoot 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:06.889
 oh like this 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:10.279
 it seems to be better 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:14.020
 and quickly oh what a pogrom I'm here 

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:14.020
 arranged here and so 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:22.790
 so interesting for how much for how much I 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:22.790
 I can destroy the helicopter 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:31.950
 how fast he reloads these minigans 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:34.830
 unrealistic little but cool anyway 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:42.110
 convince us again, well, right without 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:45.570
 cheat codes can not do here but I can wix 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.200
 sort of like that's what it is called I'm definitely not 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:49.790
 remember 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:52.320
 let's try to make a mayhem here 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:57.000
 from explosions I think we don't care 

00:06:52.320 --> 00:07:00.390
 take damage yes we don't take damage 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.960
 just at the hands of the cops let's 

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:07.380
 we test to the hands of the police 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.770
 we don't take damage on the blast anyway 

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:15.200
 we 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:18.360
 we get damage so here so let's 

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:25.920
 still explode until the next death and 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:27.230
 review finish here so here we all 

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:32.420
 died 

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:36.540
 Well, maybe it was all a fashion review and 

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:39.240
 Well, I do not remember how it is exactly called but 

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:43.680
 the essence of fashion is that we can now 

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:46.890
 wear absolutely all all weapons in two 

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:49.890
 arms that is, we can and m4 in two hands 

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:53.490
 wear and shoot and miniguns 

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:55.260
 and desert eagle eye and other weapons that 

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:59.420
 there is now we absolutely can not all 

00:07:55.260 --> 00:08:01.590
 types of weapons in both hands can carry and 

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:02.670
 this is really cool my friends 

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:05.940
 really cool 

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:09.450
 cool mod download it link will be in 

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:10.710
