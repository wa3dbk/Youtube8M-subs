00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
the juubi so they're pretty much the

the<00:02:23.349> chakra<00:02:23.800> I<00:02:23.890> think<00:02:24.099> they<00:02:24.160> use<00:02:24.280> ginkaku<00:02:24.970> or

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
the chakra I think they use ginkaku or

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.270 
the chakra I think they use ginkaku or
kinkaku<00:02:25.720> for<00:02:26.020> the<00:02:26.290> nine<00:02:26.440> tails<00:02:26.650> chakra<00:02:26.770> and

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
kinkaku for the nine tails chakra and

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.699 
kinkaku for the nine tails chakra and
they<00:02:27.400> used<00:02:27.670> that<00:02:27.910> bit<00:02:28.510> of<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:29.080> eight<00:02:29.350> tails

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
they used that bit of the eight tails

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.729 
they used that bit of the eight tails
that<00:02:30.220> saaski<00:02:30.790> brought<00:02:31.120> them<00:02:31.450> but<00:02:32.020> then<00:02:32.530> that

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
that saaski brought them but then that

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.440 
that saaski brought them but then that
would<00:02:32.890> make<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.190> whole<00:02:33.400> poor<00:02:33.760> pointless<00:02:34.300> of

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
would make the whole poor pointless of

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.380 
would make the whole poor pointless of
that<00:02:34.569> is<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.870> case<00:02:35.050> so<00:02:35.470> whatever<00:02:36.060> i'm<00:02:37.060> not

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
that is the case so whatever i'm not

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.940 
that is the case so whatever i'm not
even<00:02:37.480> i<00:02:37.630> think<00:02:37.840> about<00:02:38.020> that<00:02:38.200> right<00:02:38.260> now<00:02:38.440> but

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
even i think about that right now but

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.280 
even i think about that right now but
yeah<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.130> Madara<00:02:39.489> says<00:02:39.850> that<00:02:40.209> soon<00:02:40.870> it<00:02:41.200> will

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
yeah the Madara says that soon it will

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.830 
yeah the Madara says that soon it will
be<00:02:41.440> hard<00:02:41.830> to<00:02:42.310> control<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.880> juubi<00:02:43.420> and<00:02:43.690> he's

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
be hard to control the juubi and he's

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.410 
be hard to control the juubi and he's
telling<00:02:44.230> obito<00:02:44.920> to<00:02:44.980> use<00:02:45.610> a<00:02:45.819> shot<00:02:46.000> on<00:02:46.090> my<00:02:46.180> cell

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
telling obito to use a shot on my cell

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.270 
telling obito to use a shot on my cell
so<00:02:46.450> you<00:02:46.660> can<00:02:46.780> strengthen<00:02:47.050> the<00:02:47.290> bond<00:02:47.500> between<00:02:47.680> I

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
so you can strengthen the bond between I

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.040 
so you can strengthen the bond between I
guess<00:02:48.519> the<00:02:48.640> juubi<00:02:48.970> and<00:02:49.150> himself<00:02:49.660> so<00:02:49.810> you<00:02:49.900> can

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
guess the juubi and himself so you can

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.600 
guess the juubi and himself so you can
control<00:02:50.290> him<00:02:50.530> better<00:02:50.680> so<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.160> juubi<00:02:51.459> is

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
control him better so the juubi is

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.090 
control him better so the juubi is
really<00:02:52.269> really<00:02:52.690> powerful<00:02:52.930> and<00:02:53.410> of<00:02:53.799> course

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
really really powerful and of course

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.850 
really really powerful and of course
obito<00:02:54.730> gets<00:02:55.269> not<00:02:55.660> a<00:02:55.690> big<00:02:55.930> speech<00:02:56.230> but<00:02:56.530> he<00:02:56.620> gets

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
obito gets not a big speech but he gets

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:48.790

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:50.730 
it's crazy because the last panel he's
pretty<00:05:49.090> much<00:05:49.330> with<00:05:49.690> this<00:05:49.930> we<00:05:50.140> crushed<00:05:50.530> the

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
pretty much with this we crushed the

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.460 
pretty much with this we crushed the
Alliance<00:05:51.220> mind<00:05:51.670> well<00:05:52.210> it's<00:05:52.480> the<00:05:52.720> basics<00:05:53.290> and

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.470 
Alliance mind well it's the basics and

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.380 
Alliance mind well it's the basics and
that's<00:05:53.800> funny<00:05:54.010> because<00:05:54.160> that's<00:05:54.370> exactly<00:05:54.490> what

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:55.390 
that's funny because that's exactly what

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:56.610 
that's funny because that's exactly what
was<00:05:55.480> going<00:05:55.750> on<00:05:55.930> in<00:05:55.990> the<00:05:56.140> beginning<00:05:56.500> of<00:05:56.560> the

that was a very sad moment I know
shukaku<00:06:09.610> wasn't<00:06:10.120> the<00:06:10.180> biggest<00:06:10.470> character<00:06:11.470> in

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.620 
shukaku wasn't the biggest character in

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.890 
shukaku wasn't the biggest character in
the<00:06:11.710> series<00:06:11.980> but<00:06:12.490> since<00:06:13.240> I'm<00:06:13.390> a<00:06:13.420> huge<00:06:13.660> fan<00:06:13.690> of

moments<00:06:16.660> which<00:06:16.780> shukaku<00:06:17.110> is<00:06:17.530> still<00:06:17.770> it<00:06:18.010> was

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:18.100 
moments which shukaku is still it was

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.580 
moments which shukaku is still it was
very<00:06:18.310> sad<00:06:18.670> you<00:06:18.940> know<00:06:18.970> each<00:06:19.440> couldn't<00:06:20.440> care
