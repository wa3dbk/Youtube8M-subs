00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 how are we all here? 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.560
 once again in geneÃ¡n gators if you are 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.019
 Once bringing a new promotion we know 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.090
 of what we are talking about in this 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.190
 I come to teach you the 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.520
 good part of these offers are super 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.560
 very good and they are very expensive when 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.220
 do not have that much either, but when something is 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.730
 something but I pass on this occasion 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.279
 let's talk about the boxes of the 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.309
 anniversary of bronze legends and the 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:36.620
 anniversary boxes golden legends for a 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.620
 price of 1100 gold and 3 million 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.070
 in that it is a perfect opportunity to 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.570
 to touch a topic I do not know if to the 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.150
 that have me added in those that 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.059
 they follow my videos well that you have 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:53.420
 quite different variety of 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:56.180
 mutants not good this one of the 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:00.520
 secrets that I have is that when I go 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.500
 to the show and these offers come out let's say 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.390
 Well obviously it's about being 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.440
 too expensive not but for example mother 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.440
 of the dragons 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:16.060
 mother of the dragons king stevens 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.140
 monolith so teach the star 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.450
 golden 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.219
 I am opting to leave them no no I take them 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.229
 in account I the only ones who buys or 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:27.369
 they made novelties are those of the kind 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:29.170
 special in this case bankers or kind of 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.750
 video game as you know if they are kind of 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.960
 special first of all you have to 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.090
 see that the mutant 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.670
 and investigate the mutant let's say banker 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.790
 do not 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:44.720
 go to the bike pela 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:48.710
 enter love since practically yes 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:51.260
 you drive the pedja motorcycle well and this 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.470
 you know identify what kind of mutants 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.470
 there is 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:00.840
 and you can do good shopping for 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.540
 example the special class is the one 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.990
 have this kind of background if you have a 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.850
 type of fund like this for example be 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.040
 the legendary means that it will come out 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.290
 in what I am mentioning in the 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.689
 bronze anniversary boxes 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.450
 As you can see, I have not only been 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:21.430
 enduring the urge to climb raised to 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.829
 seven months ago but I was also 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.799
 preparing to get a new wave 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:29.519
 of mutant mutants in boxes obviously 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:32.650
 and no I think good writing now 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:35.290
 I prefer to take them out naturally in 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.950
 coins so let's see what it is that 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.170
 it came out what could have come out 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:45.239
 let's see how many new mutants 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.239
 I get going to see 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:54.640

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.690

 boys a tris was tank 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.410
 this is one of the most expensive mutants 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:22.520
 I could say that it has lowered me enough 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.520
 I am very happy with this purchase 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.070

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:31.580
 last chest I think if a witch 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:34.940
 wicked good apparently I'm close to 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.630
 complete from another 3 million we are going to 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.030
 watch 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.060
 if I reach 6 million missing 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.250
 50 and 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.570

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:56.030
 let's see what comes out not even for 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:58.040
 know what it is that I get that I get 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.620

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:04.760

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.850
 all for today 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.800
 luck could be said to have been 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.590
 balanced 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:28.969
 although I prefer to say that if it has gone 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:33.219
 very well then that the whole state 

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:37.479
