scientists<00:00:23.340> casualties<00:00:24.050> I'm<00:00:25.050> now<00:00:25.289> kind<00:00:25.439> of

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
scientists casualties I'm now kind of

scientists casualties I'm now kind of
controller<00:00:26.039> so<00:00:26.550> I<00:00:26.670> think<00:00:26.730> should<00:00:27.119> be<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.449> little

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
controller so I think should be a little

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.669 
controller so I think should be a little
bit<00:00:27.990> easier<00:00:28.109> in<00:00:28.890> fact<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.460> can<00:00:30.439> say<00:00:31.439> for<00:00:31.500> sure

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
bit easier in fact I can say for sure

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.500 
bit easier in fact I can say for sure
that<00:00:32.040> things<00:00:32.219> are<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.759> little<00:00:32.969> bit<00:00:33.180> easier<00:00:33.450> a

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
that things are a little bit easier a

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.290 
that things are a little bit easier a
lot<00:00:33.719> easier<00:00:34.110> in<00:00:34.230> fact<00:00:34.820> still<00:00:35.820> getting<00:00:36.000> on<00:00:36.059> slow

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
lot easier in fact still getting on slow

lot easier in fact still getting on slow
down<00:00:36.450> during<00:00:36.840> cutscenes<00:00:37.290> but<00:00:37.590> we<00:00:38.190> skip<00:00:38.430> them

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
down during cutscenes but we skip them

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.990 
down during cutscenes but we skip them
and<00:00:39.800> bears<00:00:40.800> off<00:00:40.980> primary<00:00:41.370> picking<00:00:41.579> up<00:00:41.899> okay

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
and bears off primary picking up okay

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.840 
and bears off primary picking up okay
so<00:00:44.860> as<00:00:45.860> he<00:00:46.010> seen<00:00:46.220> me

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
oh come on slow down hello mister was

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.359 
oh come on slow down hello mister was
actually<00:01:09.509> pretty<00:01:09.810> hard<00:01:10.050> on<00:01:10.320> double<00:01:10.740> O<00:01:10.800> agent<00:01:10.830> I

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
actually pretty hard on double O agent I

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.040 
actually pretty hard on double O agent I
have<00:01:11.850> completed<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.240> first<00:01:12.420> level<00:01:12.720> on<00:01:12.810> double

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
have completed the first level on double

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.160 
have completed the first level on double
agent<00:01:13.410> and<00:01:13.710> my<00:01:14.340> original<00:01:15.000> plan<00:01:15.509> was<00:01:16.080> to

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
agent and my original plan was to

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.330 
agent and my original plan was to
actually<00:01:16.350> display<00:01:16.650> through<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.040> game<00:01:17.190> on

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
actually display through the game on

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.210 
actually display through the game on
double<00:01:17.550> O<00:01:17.580> agent<00:01:18.530> while<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.560> had<00:01:19.740> my<00:01:19.770> controller

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
double O agent while I had my controller

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.700 
double O agent while I had my controller
but<00:01:21.140> it's<00:01:22.160> so<00:01:23.479> it's<00:01:24.479> still<00:01:24.810> too<00:01:25.259> hard<00:01:25.440> for<00:01:25.590> me

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
but it's so it's still too hard for me

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.139 
but it's so it's still too hard for me
basically<00:01:25.890> put<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.520> way<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:28.970> tried<00:01:29.970> doing

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
basically put it that way I tried doing

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:31.609 
basically put it that way I tried doing
it<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.720> was<00:01:30.750> read<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.020> another<00:01:31.320> with<00:01:31.440> so

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
it and I was read to another with so

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.950 
it and I was read to another with so
many<00:01:31.680> times<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.160> I<00:01:32.460> couldn't<00:01:32.880> be<00:01:32.970> asked<00:01:33.570> it

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
many times that I couldn't be asked it

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.790 
many times that I couldn't be asked it
was<00:01:34.080> taking<00:01:34.410> way<00:01:34.530> too<00:01:34.560> long<00:01:34.970> so<00:01:36.590> we're<00:01:37.590> still

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
was taking way too long so we're still

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.719 
was taking way too long so we're still
on<00:01:37.860> agent<00:01:38.190> mode<00:01:38.310> as<00:01:38.880> I'm<00:01:39.090> sure<00:01:39.509> did<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.350> see

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
on agent mode as I'm sure did you see

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.550 
on agent mode as I'm sure did you see
I'm<00:01:41.729> not<00:01:41.850> sure<00:01:41.940> if<00:01:42.149> you<00:01:42.240> saw<00:01:42.270> but<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.229> show<00:01:43.530> you
