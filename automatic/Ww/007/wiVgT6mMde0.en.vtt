00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.020
 the latter comes the central has sought 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.959
 a silva good head rejection of red 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:12.059
 ladies and gentlemen with the great argentina 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:13.079
 victory of sharing 3 to 1 against 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.999
 paraguay 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:19.009
 we closed the transition and we started with 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:19.009
 the match won the argentina 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.990
 the office of the Argentine for 3 to 1 in 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.010
 the field decided colorados and the amount 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.750
 of points remember that Argentina 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.730
 had started badly this is eliminatory 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.320
 true tying with bolivia losing 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.260
 with venezuela now Argentina is 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.080
 leading 13 chile-ecuador points have 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.420
 12 uruguay 11 colombia 10 venezuela that 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.940
 they play a little bit, they have 8 bolivia 4 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.890
 paraguay 4 and peru that will be next rival 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.410
 from Argentina and who plays in a while 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:04.170
 with the Venezuelan team is last with 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:06.229
 3 will also be a good occasion to 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.630
 see this rise of the Argentine team 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.400
 play as a visitor in Lima before a 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.350
 team that today for the first time 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.000
 they would mark a weapon with all the holders 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.770
 but it is to enjoy this triumph of 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.960
 Argentina because the people left 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.700
 satisfied because he saw Messi in his 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.740
 great extent by converting a great goal and 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.979
 saw a very fighter compact team 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.140
 those that are not used as much are 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.740
 they sacrifice as braña also has a 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.829
 score 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.720
 and he was able to get up in his classmates in 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.210
 equal measure is fairly even 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.070
 the forwards who lean on him like 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.869
 those that come out of the bottom as if coming out 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.640
 ball to the sides those that are 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.770
 on the sides looking for the Argentine lighthouse 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.000
 that I gauge the strikers if they have 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.149
 inconveniences are backs are 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.789
 can support gago and gago in that 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.280
 meaning has been from this point of 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:56.340
 seen from this cold statistics the 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.350
 brain of the team the most received from 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.299
 his peers and the one that more drawing 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.799
 distributed from his remarkable companions 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.450
 remarkable I think Gago avoids that 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.690
 we have are little tables away from the arch 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.799
 rival was a messi that started from the 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.840
 half of the court and he had left 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.090
 far away the opposite arch I think that 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.950
 that pass I already do here we have another 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.760
 statistics that has to do with the 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.760
 archery shots 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.780
 Oh 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:25.069
 eight shots of the Argentine- against five 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.069
 of the Paraguayan team 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.400
 these are the team's auctions 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:33.550
 Argentine let's go here to see 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.590
 What is messi that fires at the top? 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.170
 ball hitting the stick 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.310
 from this position which also 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:45.530
 ago is di maria 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.530
 in this higuain 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.120
 now they accompanied 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.540
 from here rodrigo palace 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.209
 from this position again messi the 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.150
 shot that hit the stick and once again 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.590
 from Messi who also hit the wood in 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.200
 the previous one and this is the free throw that 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.480
 ends up becoming a goal are many 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.700
 less the archery of the team 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.709
 Paraguayan notable remarkable statistics 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.200
 and what of messi marking the one of belgium has 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.489
 been out there disappeared during great 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.170
 first half stretch we asked 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.220
 we were messi but after 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.020
 when it appeared it has really been 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.030
 important the Argentine team the 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.170
 Paraguayans at a given moment 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.840
 especially in the first time 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.550
 they cut a lot and made many mistakes 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.370
 to try to recompose the equipment 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:32.040
 they pressed they flipped the players 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.269
 Argentineans was not severe the referee in 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.950
 that moment of the game because 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.959
 they finished with two cautioned nothing more 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.930
 in the first time the case of ortiz and 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:42.450
 the case of piris the other marker but 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.100
 when you see the statistics at the end 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.160
 of the story seems to end 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.380
 even 19 to 14 fouls committed 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.910
 many more team fouls 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.510
 Paraguayan of the Argentine team 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.100
 but of course the greatest accumulation 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.110
 of fouls occurred in the first time 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.570
 Argentina when it overflowed the 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.190
 Paraguayan team in the first part of 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.140
 second time Paraguay has more the 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.240
 ball has less chance of 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.620
 turn from committing faults and it's there 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.110
 where the Argentine team has more 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.930
 difficulties and compensates in amount of 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.209
 fouls committed to the Paraguayan team 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.370
 I did not like arbitration, I did not like 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.410
 he seemed severe he was condescending with 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.600
 some Paraguayan soccer players who 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.730
 they repeated not because of bad faith but they 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.740
 they repeated cutting off permanently if 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.780
 you apply the yellow card very 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.190
 fast that's over it's over 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.520
 quickly cut off the rough game 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:36.730
 this boot just if you guessed right maybe 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.170
 in the hand was criminal was clear but of 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.790
 paraguay was located but it is 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.230
 truth what I said let's separate in your 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.640
 Comment fernando marked paraguay 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.840
 this is done to slow down the 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.310
 Argentine team clear because 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.650
 simply uvi is active marker 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.620
 improvised marker gives you the 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.440
 possibility 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.360
 every time he enters the area it 's almost goal 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.100
 has had great goalscorer in the 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.320
 Argentina one remembers that grabs in the 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.970
 closet and is more disputed the average 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.710
 pipe goal higuain is awesome is 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.720
 tremendous what of higuaín the auction of 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.310
 Messi was on the stick one of the 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.919
 frustrations later I was going to compensate 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.560
 another one guesses this month and he arrives 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:12.120
 to caracas definition that several times has 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.560
 tried and made messi for the 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.870
 barcelona and by extension of argentine 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.550
 here hit the stick insisted but it was 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.830
 his auction bounced the name of Paraguay and 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:23.220
 there is an advance position of higuain in the 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.810
 play that happens to that messi auction 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.090
 it's the steal 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.250
 in face hooks comes to face the 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.440
 goalkeeper to watch they touch to get to 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.990
 la villar villar for vibrato cavilar les 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.790
 accommodates the ball went straight to the goal that 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.190
 it was when he finishes messi is positioned 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.510
 enters higuaín when it comes to search already 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.520
 that even the free-kick goal said 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.960
 fernando if the distance of 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.480
 the barrier and the distance the barrier is 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.520
 he respected although he had been close to 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:49.870
 free kick in the first half here 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.990
 convert an extraordinary goal 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.800
 also the time if this instruction 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.020
 a goal 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.970
 impeccable and this is a new action that 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.919
 has higuaín playing spaces 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.379
 ortiz's back there goes the pass of 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:05.060
 messi without looking at it knowing that there is 

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:06.780
 a gap that Ortiz does not reach the same 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.730
 top 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.030
 and they beat their chest to life has the 

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:15.430
 definition in the head the pipe 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:17.650
 umbrella play and advanced position 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.150
 Well I'm left with the doubt because I 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.280
 it seems that behind the Paraguayan there is a 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:24.190
 Argentine player who later appears 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.050
 when the action starts I do not know if it was 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:29.290
 in advanced position the player 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:31.860
 Paraguayan but ultimately by many 

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:34.990
 Sebastian reasons is a great night 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:37.660
 because the public in the interior had the 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.800
 opportunity here in córdoba have come 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.590
 from different provinces of Argentina 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.360
 to see the Argentine national team 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.430
 the other the other the news 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.500
 important is that the Argentine team 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:49.630
 is on the rise and is finding a 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.930
 functioning and that has players from 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.930
 high level
