00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
in the middle and that's it now we look

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.449 
in the middle and that's it now we look
at<00:02:11.910> chibi<00:02:12.450> Robo<00:02:12.480> park<00:02:12.990> patrol<00:02:13.349> and<00:02:13.590> we<00:02:13.620> see

and letters across the chipboard so

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.860 
and letters across the chipboard so
that's<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.579> great<00:02:20.879> way<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.090> tell<00:02:21.450> what

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
that's a great way to tell what

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.500 
that's a great way to tell what
it's<00:02:22.349> real<00:02:22.620> or<00:02:22.799> fake<00:02:23.030> now<00:02:24.030> you<00:02:24.090> look<00:02:24.269> at<00:02:24.390> the

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
it's real or fake now you look at the

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.479 
it's real or fake now you look at the
back<00:02:24.690> here<00:02:24.720> you<00:02:25.140> look<00:02:25.349> at<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.709> lettering<00:02:26.370> on

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
back here you look at the lettering on

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.119 
back here you look at the lettering on
the<00:02:26.519> serial<00:02:26.970> number<00:02:27.269> and<00:02:27.709> this<00:02:28.709> is<00:02:28.890> another

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
the serial number and this is another

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:30.740 
the serial number and this is another
good<00:02:29.340> way<00:02:29.519> to<00:02:29.549> spot<00:02:29.879> but<00:02:30.060> only<00:02:30.239> if<00:02:30.420> you<00:02:30.540> have<00:02:30.720> a

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
good way to spot but only if you have a

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.350 
good way to spot but only if you have a
side-by-side<00:02:31.049> comparison<00:02:31.640> the<00:02:32.640> Pokemon<00:02:33.120> one

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
centered a little bit side-by-side you

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.809 
centered a little bit side-by-side you
can<00:02:40.079> really<00:02:40.560> tell<00:02:40.769> the<00:02:40.799> difference<00:02:40.950> here<00:02:41.640> but

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819
