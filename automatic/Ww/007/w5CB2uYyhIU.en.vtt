That's me, Mohit...

00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:19.917
My life was set...

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000

00:00:41.125 --> 00:00:41.750

00:00:48.167 --> 00:00:49.333

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.292
To cover up one lie...
you end up lying a hundred times.

00:01:32.708 --> 00:01:33.583
Mohit!!

00:01:33.708 --> 00:01:36.500
We all need to pretend
that Mohit still works here...

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.500
I detest lies

00:01:38.625 --> 00:01:39.333
Papa hates lies.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.542
Shit!

00:01:41.667 --> 00:01:43.083
So you're bankrupt?

00:01:44.042 --> 00:01:45.000

Love is everything!
What else do you need to be happy?

00:01:55.667 --> 00:01:56.083
Money.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.083
So what if there's no money...

00:01:59.208 --> 00:02:00.208
there's love... unlimited.

00:02:07.083 --> 00:02:09.292
Sir we're actually asking
for your permission...

00:02:09.417 --> 00:02:11.167

and get married!

00:02:11.292 --> 00:02:12.042
