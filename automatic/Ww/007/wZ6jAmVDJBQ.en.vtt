00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:04.389
 telephone centrals inti de fonaes 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.740
 to pay a little 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.980
 dirk the benefits which are for the benefit of telephone exchanges 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.169
 the typhoon 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:16.499
 cuomo talk a little about how it works 

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:18.849
 understanding the why yes no what 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:22.539
 among the benefits that are found this fact that integrates offices 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:23.569
 remote 

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:26.569
 and eliminate the cost of branch communications 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.059
 the benefit of using the same data network as these becomes a 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:33.640
 benefit 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.910
 like teleworking 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.380
 make a powerful tool 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.380
 the fact is being done is to harm and 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.970
 because we say it's cheaper they're fine 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.270
 the fact that flexibility is flexible the system and piti to this fund 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.420
 Mobility 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.149
 and because we say that to examine it I run substantial in the use of the mobile 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.830
 that this have more capacity input and output 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:00.789
 that this 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:04.220
 I gave yamaha five recurring cars in his work 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.580
 I think that all of that how to understand a little is undertaken in the operation of 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.540
 our telephone exchanges 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.100
 now we have a telephone exchange we are going to say that they are about two hours 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.080
 which for 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.460
 convention were connected to the way we know it personally 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.650
 the line was connected to the normal copper lines of the 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.250
 normal telephone 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.710
 to which he accessed people from cell phones has the 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.160
 normal telephony 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.770
 in the way we know it 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.140
 we hire specialized telephone services 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.230
 that you have connected these exchanges to telephone networks 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.170
 internal of our system 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.330
 being necessary 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.170
 having a new employee 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.990
 a new wiring 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.770
 pierre wanted a service a third 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.460
 They definitely did not use technology that we used but did not share 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.130
 the fonaes telephone exchanges 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.380
 they are hybrids 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.760
 when we say my life 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.760
 we are talking about the fact that they include different technologies 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.420
 one of them is the tdma technology 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.319
 which is that the traditional technology that we know at present our 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:09.819
 telephonic central 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.289
 and the other one is mobile technology 

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:14.909
 or the concept of voice over ip 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.909
 or communications about inter-protocols 

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:20.549
 Benefits 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:25.610
 we are going to use the same wiring that was used for the network in our 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:27.009
 physical 

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:30.249
 in the same way as our computer used the internet 

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:32.359
 coaches to data programs 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:34.089
 they will be able to do it 

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:35.180
 the telephones 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.820
 then we are to the same data structure that the company has 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:44.390
 and in the case in fact need to extend this connection simply 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.600
 we connect a new phone to this company data network 

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:52.049
 we do not require percent expert help from third parties possibly connect a 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.469
 new cable switches 

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:57.249
 or it depends on the other physio of the network's physiology that the topology 

00:02:57.249 --> 00:02:59.959
 of the network of you have in your office 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.319
 these tickets connects to internet 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.579
 then this gives us a benefit let's go the one that is represented orange what 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:08.839
 is better and that is betraying in copper 

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:09.940
 and in green 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.939
 he what in the tele-formula 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:13.579
 voip communications 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:18.629
 then we are seeing that the same plant indifferently allows us 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:21.629
 use of mobile telephony and traditional telephony 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:24.979
 when connected to the internet 

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:28.789
 per cent gives us the possibility of and the potential to be able to communicate to 

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:30.389
 anywhere in the world 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.219
 allowing us through another connection 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:35.689
 to have an office in South America 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:38.159
 an office anywhere else in the world 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:41.620
 which is connected to the same central service 

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:45.559
 what does this mean our new office only requires connection to 

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:47.949
 internet and some phones and 

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:51.789
 another reform of sofom photographer not of embasado in sofora 

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:55.439
 to be able to connect without fearing the same power as if they were in our 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:56.699
 physical 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:57.900
 definitely 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.239
 the fact that simplicity for sharing facilitates flexibility 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.169
 and the simplicity that to its expansion 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:10.279
 a new job is only going to require a set phone connected 

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:11.629
 they are already phones go 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.959
 om sofom phone connected to our central and we can already 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.209
 Activate 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.629
 an arduous or branch in other parts of the world 

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:20.569
 It is true 

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:23.169
 then percent we understand 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:26.509
 It has flexibility because it allows us to use the data network 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:28.180
 Currently we have keter 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.180
 and every day is simpler than hehco figure 

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:35.589
 percent and hybrids not to the power of voip technology and it gives us the power of the 

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:37.419
 tdma technology 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:38.610
 what does it mean 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.430
 that we have the power of technology 20 ladies 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.039
 means here is not that people in europe 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:45.310
 or make calls 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.110
 to not unofficial to principal in the United States at no cost 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.210
 because the internal communication is being behind the central 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.840
 The first thing we are going to do is save costs 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.840
 by eliminating the volume of the other internal 

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:01.379
 as well 

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:03.419
 a second example that we can have 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:07.189
 is that our fihsin in South America as in Latin America where the 

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:11.779
 remote offices will be able to use the resources to make local calls in 

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:15.030
 the case of ours that without this unit using the conventional lines 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:19.199
 dd of land of tenneco hours 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.860
 we will be able to integrate the messaging concept 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.249
 our central are ready to join 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:29.949
 percent all the information takes real there was ismael pass it by mail 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:31.529
 electronic 

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:34.999
 achieve in this way unify the complete communications of the company 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:41.199
 more or less this is a diagram of the elements that make up or in which the 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:43.839
 connection diagram of a central Haitian asks is 

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:44.900
 that allows us 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.099
 checking 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:49.580
 be able to integrate remote offices eliminating the cost of communication between 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:50.740
 branch offices 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.160
 which uses the data network which are flexibility and simple work to expand 

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:59.659
 our phones can be used the software-based phones and 

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:03.039
 another normal way is through a belly thing that exhibits quite 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:04.719
 flexible connection 

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:08.529
 allows to telecommuting to work from home using the same 

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:11.909
 resources with the same presence and the same by the office 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:14.669
 uses traditional lines 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:16.749
 integrates mobile technology 

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:19.809
 it is foreseeable that mobility allows more than a suffoon 

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:23.659
 can not continue this technology to our cell phones 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:30.849
 represents a substantial saving in the use in the penis in the development of 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:31.879
 communications 

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:35.990
 the use of the mobile phone gives us an important element in cost reduction 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.099
 with rates 

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:40.489
 in some cases p up to 60% savings 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:45.879
 eliminating the cost between kofi without them is an important part of our 

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:47.469
 communication costs 

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:50.939
 Smart call routing for the best resources 

00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:55.110
 in case of a local yamaha in the united states use the dncd in which it is 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:57.330
 authorized to do so are unlimited 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.560
 and another in the international call to a provider to use our service 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.180
 voip 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:03.419
 to get there 

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:06.840
 to that call in the most efficient way by improving the process of 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.840
 communication 

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:14.219
 We invite you to review our triple-double page
