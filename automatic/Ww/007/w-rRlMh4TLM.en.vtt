00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.279
 very good to all I welcome you 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.099
 to a new video of my weapon guide 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:10.990
 legendarias de bardenas 2 we continue with 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:13.210
 the guns and the one that touches today is the 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.100
 so legendary gun also known 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.200
 like the hornets 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.500
 this tutorial is going to be very simple 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:24.430
 because the boss who releases us this weapon 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.960
 is the head of the game tutorial as well 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.640
 that we are not going to need any mission 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.320
 secondary or unlock anything for 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.420
 get it what we will have to do 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.809
 is to go to the clap house is 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.700
 I also get winzer wast and follow 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.260
 forwards until you get to where you are 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.780
 dragons steers that will be the boss 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.829
 we went through completely and we 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:47.740
 we go to the door that takes us to 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.980
 the part where hammerl is ok 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:53.620
 once it got to be tension when 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.330
 appear we have to turn around 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.480
 and go back to travel again to which are 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.430
 wash 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.470
 so what will happen is that we 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.989
 we will find the boss every time 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.309
 let's go out and enter the game there 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.400
 will be the link that we will have to do 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.170
 is to kill him go out and re - enter 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.730
 first before we will also have to 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.060
 look if he has released the weapon that 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.060
 we want 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.360
 the only problem that this form has 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.970
 the only one I've seen is that he knows very 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.200
 scattered in the range there to give you a little 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.420
 talk about the skin because I'm looking 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.420
 but I did not find it so I went out between 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.870
 to continue and we'll start right at 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.340
 side of the boss without having to make us 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.450
 no agreement or any complication 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.399
 to get to him 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.310
 Now I kill him again and he does not let go 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:43.700
 so I would advance to the part in the 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:47.960
 loose food does not take much late and neither 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:50.119
 even 57 minutes 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.500
 I did not count the times I did it but 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:55.920
 they were like some 15 20 25 times I do not know the 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.620
 true 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.040
 Although I am 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:03.110
 a little bit 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.820
 in the corner just where it is always a 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.960
 result in the same place where I was 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:11.290
 the revolving jacobs of the first time more 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.290
 or less 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:22.510
 now open the test shot the test 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.330
 of shooting this weapon with the precise 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.890
 of dv 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.190
 no twin better said 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:33.340
 because it is armed by bursts of weapons 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.490
 when you aim with them, they shoot 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.920
 rafa and if you use the prefix twin good in 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.709
 the attitudes of rim shoots two bullets 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.050
 every time I make a shot so the 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.280
 bursts will be twice as many bullets per 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.819
 so to speak 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.310
 there I was fighting one of the problems 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.740
 behind more than just has corrosive damage 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.860
 so it's going to be 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:59.230
 a problem because not all enemies 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.600
 are vulnerable to corruption in 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.010
 madrid for example resists pretty well 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.200
 the corruption 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.799
 but not like right now we are in 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.680
 normal way the experts are not going either 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:14.379
 to cost a lot to defeat them but then already 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.140
 when we go to mode p 8 it is not going to 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:18.879
 serve to spend more here you see me 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.790
 against the enemies that resist me 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:24.750
 rather not as much as with gas 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.310
 example but that's enough because 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.520
 except the robots that the robot are 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.320
 quite vulnerable to correction 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.440
 look there I'm shooting at the wall 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.940
 so you can see the bursts of two in 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.470
 plan 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:44.710
 and is a reference as about 10 8 and 22 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.260
 with translation I think eight and eight 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.390
 shots are actually four shots but 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.400
 which are two bullets each one if not 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.890
 we had that prefix and we had another 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.470
 that the cadence or the 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.640
 charger or whatever it would only fire in 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.530
 four in four bullets 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.040
 instead of 88 may be what I've put 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.469
 it is specifically 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:08.310
 the crossed parts are all parts of the 

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:10.680
 of the weapon because each part gives in a 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.680
 armed is going to add a counter 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.949
 rafa or a weapon an assault rifle 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.829
 such for example if you have two parts give 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:21.930
 for a burst of two or three and if 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.990
 has four parts it will make four or 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.050
 of five 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.430
 there you see me now against bad craw with 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.650
 this weapon 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.930
 it cost me less than hanging 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:36.080
 it was resistant to corrosion because 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.180
 it's quite a better weapon but still 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.870
 not that it costs me little I need 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.360
 put the enfant twice 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.600
 and clear against such a soft enemy 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.410
 it's not something that 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.210
 that is very good 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.099
 normally in with a non-legendary weapon 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:56.460
 you can even kill much faster 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:58.139
 what with this but good in the part 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.930
 negative that you have that only has damage 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:03.760
 corrosive against enemies is also not 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:06.750
 it's so bad 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:10.410
 it is not very complicated he 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:13.410
 keep alive in Lope 8 with her but it's 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:17.190
 simpler with a more appropriate weapon 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:20.490
 for example explosive weapons or weapons of 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.800
 normal damage without any element but 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.750
 Clear 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.139
 is the fault of this weapon that only has 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.139
 corruption 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.979
 one of the few good things about this 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:33.830
 weapon is that if you are doing a speed 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:35.930
 the run is going to come very well a spirit 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.569
 land is to play the game as fast 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.729
 possible and this weapon very good for that 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:43.280
 because once in a while when you kill the 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:45.670
 first boss that leaves a trail to the 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.800
 them or he usually lets go 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:50.380
 here we go with the statistics of the weapon 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.720
 the deformed or very low difficulty in the 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.100
 lowest I've seen because you do not have 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.930
 to do practically nothing and the 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:59.800
 enemy is the simplest thing in the world 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:03.550
 little use in the normal world and 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:05.140
 less at 18 because it's only going to be useful 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.350
 when there are a lot of stevedores and 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.870
 of robots 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:11.180
 against bosses because I also put it very 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.520
 low because there are not many bosses that are 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.680
 weak to correction is honey sticks 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.230
 of this weapon that is only corrosive not 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.550
 It has more aspects and well that 's it 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.110
 I hope you liked the video if 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.120
 you liked it, you can give the aik that I 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.520
 Help pretty much comment if you have any 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.120
 suggestion and subscribe for more up 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.540
 the next 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.540
 good shape or
