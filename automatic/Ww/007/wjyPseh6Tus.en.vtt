00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
what the brush looks like and

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.899 
what the brush looks like and
unfortunately<00:01:04.339> the<00:01:05.339> new<00:01:05.489> one<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.760> they've

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
unfortunately the new one that they've

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.740 
unfortunately the new one that they've
come<00:01:06.180> out<00:01:06.210> with<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.890> pretty<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:08.540> don't<00:01:09.540> know<00:01:09.600> how

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
to basically say and I think it's just

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.210 
to basically say and I think it's just
crap<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.439> be<00:01:13.560> honest<00:01:13.830> with<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.100> don't

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
crap to be honest with you I don't

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.210 
crap to be honest with you I don't
really<00:01:14.549> like<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.270> mascara<00:01:16.070> it's<00:01:17.070> the

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
really like the mascara it's the

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.039 
really like the mascara it's the
plumping<00:01:17.670> again<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.210> silver<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.720> green

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
plumping again this is silver and green

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.550 
plumping again this is silver and green
and<00:01:19.369> the<00:01:20.369> brush<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.689> little<00:01:22.020> bit<00:01:22.310> weird<00:01:24.560> this

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
and the brush is a little bit weird this

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.300 
and the brush is a little bit weird this
is<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.830> brush<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:27.659> massive<00:01:28.470> compared<00:01:29.130> to

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
is the brush it is massive compared to

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.870 
is the brush it is massive compared to
my<00:01:29.430> eye<00:01:29.509> you<00:01:30.509> see<00:01:30.720> how<00:01:30.840> big<00:01:31.110> this<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.409> I

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
my eye you see how big this is I

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.249 
my eye you see how big this is I
wouldn't<00:01:32.880> have<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.030> problem<00:01:33.299> with<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.930> coming

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
wouldn't have a problem with it coming

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.710 
wouldn't have a problem with it coming
to<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.530> tapered<00:01:35.070> point<00:01:35.369> which<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.210> think<00:01:36.360> it's

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
to a tapered point which is I think it's

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.850 
to a tapered point which is I think it's
good<00:01:36.930> so<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.200> can<00:01:37.350> get<00:01:37.470> in<00:01:37.590> there<00:01:37.710> in<00:01:37.799> the

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
good so you can get in there in the

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.469 
good so you can get in there in the
corners<00:01:38.189> which<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.430> like<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.850> but<00:01:39.060> this<00:01:39.180> brush

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
corners which I like that but this brush

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.280 
corners which I like that but this brush
is<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:39.720> large<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:41.490> just<00:01:41.939> don't<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:42.720> mean<00:01:42.930> the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
is so large that I just don't I mean the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.899 
is so large that I just don't I mean the
other<00:01:43.409> one<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:43.590> large<00:01:43.920> but<00:01:44.159> I'm<00:01:44.280> used<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.640> the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
other one is large but I'm used to the

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.310 
other one is large but I'm used to the
full<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.390> bristles<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:45.990> this<00:01:46.110> one<00:01:46.290> just

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
full of bristles and this one just

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.100 
full of bristles and this one just
doesn't<00:01:46.560> as<00:01:46.920> I'm<00:01:47.490> trying<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:48.030> kind<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.390> work<00:01:48.930> it

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
doesn't as I'm trying to kind of work it

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.230 
doesn't as I'm trying to kind of work it
into<00:01:49.740> my<00:01:49.920> lashes<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.549> feel<00:01:50.700> like<00:01:50.820> it's<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.060> little

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
into my lashes I feel like it's a little

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.620 
into my lashes I feel like it's a little
bit<00:01:51.360> hard<00:01:51.600> um<00:01:52.250> I<00:01:53.250> don't<00:01:53.880> think<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.329> brush<00:01:54.479> is

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
bit hard um I don't think the brush is

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.310 
bit hard um I don't think the brush is
very<00:01:54.810> practical<00:01:54.990> now<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:56.729> formula<00:01:57.320> the

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
very practical now the formula the

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.480 
very practical now the formula the
formula<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:59.719> one<00:02:00.719> is<00:02:00.899> smells<00:02:01.200> funky<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.920> I

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
formula is one is smells funky and I

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.740 
formula is one is smells funky and I
don't<00:02:02.820> know<00:02:02.939> if<00:02:03.060> it's<00:02:03.180> supposed<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.600> smell

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
don't know if it's supposed to smell

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.459 
don't know if it's supposed to smell
like<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:05.040> just<00:02:05.130> it's<00:02:05.729> not<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.479> don't<00:02:07.409> know

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
like that it just it's not I don't know

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.109 
like that it just it's not I don't know
I<00:02:07.500> guess<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.920> just<00:02:07.950> doesn't<00:02:08.580> smell<00:02:08.700> good<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:09.030> me

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
I guess it just doesn't smell good to me

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.619 
I guess it just doesn't smell good to me
in<00:02:09.360> my<00:02:09.509> opinion<00:02:09.810> but<00:02:10.430> the<00:02:11.430> formula<00:02:11.940> is<00:02:11.970> very

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
in my opinion but the formula is very

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.460 
in my opinion but the formula is very
black<00:02:12.900> which<00:02:13.140> I

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
black which I

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.050 
black which I
like<00:02:13.620> that<00:02:13.800> i<00:02:13.860> like<00:02:13.890> how<00:02:14.280> black<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.730> formula

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
like that i like how black the formula

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.790 
like that i like how black the formula
is<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.300> i<00:02:15.360> always<00:02:15.540> give<00:02:15.780> up<00:02:15.870> my<00:02:15.960> scares<00:02:16.290> the

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
is and i always give up my scares the

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.500 
is and i always give up my scares the
darkest<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.520> bacchus<00:02:17.850> that<00:02:17.970> i<00:02:18.030> can<00:02:18.150> get<00:02:18.330> this

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
darkest the bacchus that i can get this

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.780 
darkest the bacchus that i can get this
is<00:02:18.770> the<00:02:19.770> black<00:02:19.980> is<00:02:20.160> black<00:02:20.370> one<00:02:21.710> the<00:02:22.710> mascara<00:02:23.640> is

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
is the black is black one the mascara is

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.940 
is the black is black one the mascara is
really<00:02:24.240> black<00:02:24.480> itself<00:02:24.810> which<00:02:25.020> is<00:02:25.170> great<00:02:25.410> I

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
really black itself which is great I

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.150 
really black itself which is great I
love<00:02:26.430> black<00:02:26.880> mascara<00:02:27.450> but<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.650> formula<00:02:29.100> is

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
love black mascara but the formula is

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.550 
love black mascara but the formula is
too<00:02:29.460> wet<00:02:29.670> from<00:02:29.820> my<00:02:30.000> preference<00:02:30.660> I<00:02:30.840> prefer<00:02:30.870> a

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
too wet from my preference I prefer a

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.850 
too wet from my preference I prefer a
mascara<00:02:32.280> that<00:02:32.430> is<00:02:32.700> drier<00:02:33.120> that<00:02:34.020> I<00:02:34.380> feel<00:02:34.710> like

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
mascara that is drier that I feel like

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.740 
mascara that is drier that I feel like
can<00:02:35.070> actually<00:02:35.430> coat<00:02:35.670> my<00:02:35.820> lashes<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.390> extend

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
can actually coat my lashes and extend

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.630 
can actually coat my lashes and extend
them<00:02:36.900> versus<00:02:37.380> clumping<00:02:37.980> them<00:02:38.130> together<00:02:38.460> which

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
them versus clumping them together which

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.920 
them versus clumping them together which
I<00:02:38.790> feel<00:02:38.910> like<00:02:39.060> that's<00:02:39.300> what<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:39.600> get<00:02:39.720> with

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
I feel like that's what you get with

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.500 
I feel like that's what you get with
really<00:02:40.260> wet<00:02:40.410> formulas<00:02:41.090> some<00:02:42.090> people<00:02:42.330> like<00:02:42.480> it

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
really wet formulas some people like it

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.480 
really wet formulas some people like it
some<00:02:42.750> people<00:02:42.810> don't<00:02:43.050> and<00:02:43.710> this<00:02:43.980> is<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.280> brush

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
some people don't and this is the brush

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.340 
some people don't and this is the brush
again<00:02:44.850> I<00:02:45.150> don't<00:02:45.390> like<00:02:45.570> it<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:45.900> think<00:02:45.930> it's<00:02:46.260> a

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
again I don't like it I think it's a

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.890 
again I don't like it I think it's a
waste<00:02:46.500> of<00:02:46.680> money<00:02:46.860> if<00:02:47.220> you<00:02:48.150> had<00:02:48.330> to<00:02:48.480> choose<00:02:48.660> one

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
waste of money if you had to choose one

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.300 
waste of money if you had to choose one
or<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.110> other<00:02:49.200> I<00:02:49.410> definitely<00:02:49.709> choose<00:02:50.070> the

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
or the other I definitely choose the

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.640 
or the other I definitely choose the
original<00:02:50.790> girl<00:02:51.630> lashes<00:02:52.020> which<00:02:52.200> is<00:02:52.380> just<00:02:52.530> a

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
original girl lashes which is just a

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.040 
original girl lashes which is just a
solid<00:02:52.830> green<00:02:53.160> tube<00:02:53.459> I<00:02:53.790> honestly<00:02:54.510> I<00:02:54.750> don't<00:02:54.870> know

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
solid green tube I honestly I don't know

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.870 
solid green tube I honestly I don't know
what<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.770> price<00:02:56.010> ranges<00:02:56.550> are<00:02:56.700> I<00:02:56.730> think

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880
