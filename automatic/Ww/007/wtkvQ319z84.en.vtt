00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.120 

let's<00:00:05.980> have<00:00:06.160> a<00:00:06.190> look<00:00:06.400> now<00:00:06.430> just<00:00:06.910> reading<00:00:07.420> spin

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
let's have a look now just reading spin

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.620 
let's have a look now just reading spin
you<00:00:09.130> can<00:00:09.280> start<00:00:09.550> here<00:00:09.790> going<00:00:10.180> to<00:00:10.240> start<00:00:10.510> with

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:10.630 
you can start here going to start with

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.770 
you can start here going to start with
topspin<00:00:11.110> and<00:00:11.350> you<00:00:11.440> can<00:00:11.590> see<00:00:11.770> that<00:00:12.570> when<00:00:13.570> the

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:13.780 
topspin and you can see that when the

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.720 
topspin and you can see that when the
the<00:00:14.080> racket<00:00:14.410> is<00:00:14.500> traveling<00:00:14.950> forwards<00:00:15.520> and

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.730 
the racket is traveling forwards and

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.279 
the racket is traveling forwards and
upwards<00:00:15.879> it<00:00:16.570> has<00:00:16.750> that<00:00:16.900> little<00:00:17.050> bit<00:00:17.230> of

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:17.289 
upwards it has that little bit of

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:19.800 
upwards it has that little bit of
forward<00:00:17.680> tilt<00:00:17.950> that<00:00:18.789> is<00:00:18.940> producing<00:00:19.420> a<00:00:19.480> fairly

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
forward tilt that is producing a fairly

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.080 
forward tilt that is producing a fairly
significant<00:00:20.410> amount<00:00:20.620> of<00:00:20.680> topspin<00:00:21.190> and<00:00:23.790> it's<00:00:24.790> a

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.090 
significant amount of topspin and it's a

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.760 
significant amount of topspin and it's a
pretty<00:00:25.510> much<00:00:25.660> immediately<00:00:25.930> obviously

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:26.770 
pretty much immediately obviously

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.110 
pretty much immediately obviously
obviously<00:00:27.490> the<00:00:27.640> tot<00:00:27.820> ziens<00:00:27.850> being<00:00:28.300> produced

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:30.120 
obviously the tot ziens being produced

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.030 
obviously the tot ziens being produced
whereas<00:00:31.120> in<00:00:31.390> comparison<00:00:31.600> with<00:00:32.349> backspin<00:00:32.860> the

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 
whereas in comparison with backspin the

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.430 
whereas in comparison with backspin the
bat<00:00:33.219> is<00:00:33.460> now<00:00:33.700> traveling<00:00:34.290> forwards<00:00:35.290> and

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
bat is now traveling forwards and

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.560 
bat is now traveling forwards and
downwards

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
downwards

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.639 
downwards
sometimes<00:00:37.570> when<00:00:37.749> pushing<00:00:38.019> the<00:00:38.289> bat<00:00:38.469> won't

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:38.649 
sometimes when pushing the bat won't

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:41.430 
sometimes when pushing the bat won't
travel<00:00:38.920> all<00:00:39.280> that<00:00:39.550> much<00:00:39.699> downwards<00:00:40.239> but<00:00:41.230> the

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
travel all that much downwards but the

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.889 
travel all that much downwards but the
tilting<00:00:41.829> of<00:00:41.949> the<00:00:41.980> racquet<00:00:42.339> backward<00:00:42.789> as<00:00:43.719> you

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:43.899 
tilting of the racquet backward as you

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:45.389 
tilting of the racquet backward as you
can<00:00:44.019> see<00:00:44.140> the<00:00:44.260> racket<00:00:44.559> till<00:00:44.739> the<00:00:44.920> devil

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399 
can see the racket till the devil

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:47.729 
can see the racket till the devil
produce<00:00:46.210> backspin<00:00:46.690> as<00:00:46.839> well<00:00:47.019> so<00:00:47.230> if<00:00:47.289> the<00:00:47.409> bed

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
produce backspin as well so if the bed

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:50.430 
produce backspin as well so if the bed
is<00:00:47.859> traveling<00:00:48.249> forwards<00:00:48.819> but<00:00:49.569> is<00:00:49.719> tilted<00:00:50.140> over

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
is traveling forwards but is tilted over

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.259 
is traveling forwards but is tilted over
you'll<00:00:50.769> get<00:00:50.920> topspin<00:00:51.370> and<00:00:51.550> if<00:00:51.819> it's<00:00:51.969> tilted

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:52.269 
you'll get topspin and if it's tilted

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:55.169 
you'll get topspin and if it's tilted
backwards<00:00:52.659> you'll<00:00:53.050> get<00:00:53.230> our<00:00:53.350> backspin<00:00:54.179> now

00:00:55.169 --> 00:00:55.179 
backwards you'll get our backspin now

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:58.200 
backwards you'll get our backspin now
this<00:00:55.659> is<00:00:55.870> a<00:00:56.309> producing<00:00:57.309> side<00:00:57.550> spin<00:00:57.909> and

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
this is a producing side spin and

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.959 
this is a producing side spin and
topspin<00:00:58.749> together<00:00:59.370> you'll<00:01:00.370> see<00:01:00.609> in<00:01:00.760> some<00:01:00.940> of

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
topspin together you'll see in some of

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.599 
topspin together you'll see in some of
our<00:01:01.149> later<00:01:01.420> videos<00:01:01.839> when<00:01:02.829> you<00:01:02.949> see<00:01:03.159> how<00:01:03.550> to

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609 
our later videos when you see how to

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:06.120 
our later videos when you see how to
play<00:01:04.120> these<00:01:04.390> basic<00:01:04.780> strokes<00:01:05.080> the<00:01:05.800> tricky

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
play these basic strokes the tricky

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.389 
play these basic strokes the tricky
thing<00:01:06.340> about<00:01:06.460> hung<00:01:06.909> sights<00:01:07.210> been<00:01:07.510> especially

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:08.399 
thing about hung sights been especially

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:11.459 
thing about hung sights been especially
sights<00:01:09.399> been<00:01:09.640> in<00:01:09.759> topspin<00:01:10.240> when<00:01:10.960> used<00:01:11.259> with

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:11.469 
sights been in topspin when used with

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:13.709 
sights been in topspin when used with
larger<00:01:11.829> strokes<00:01:12.159> the<00:01:12.969> tricky<00:01:13.270> thing<00:01:13.450> is<00:01:13.479> that

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:13.719 
larger strokes the tricky thing is that

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:15.480 
larger strokes the tricky thing is that
the<00:01:13.899> stroke<00:01:14.140> isn't<00:01:14.469> actually<00:01:15.009> all<00:01:15.159> that<00:01:15.280> much

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
the stroke isn't actually all that much

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.740 
the stroke isn't actually all that much
different<00:01:16.060> in<00:01:16.409> terms<00:01:17.409> of<00:01:17.680> where<00:01:17.920> you<00:01:17.950> set<00:01:18.280> up

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
different in terms of where you set up

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.929 
different in terms of where you set up
the<00:01:19.750> bat<00:01:19.960> is<00:01:20.140> taken<00:01:20.799> back<00:01:21.009> to<00:01:21.039> roughly<00:01:21.700> that

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
the bat is taken back to roughly that

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:24.060 
the bat is taken back to roughly that
same<00:01:22.149> location<00:01:22.329> touch<00:01:22.930> not<00:01:23.469> as<00:01:23.619> simple<00:01:23.979> as

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
same location touch not as simple as

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.190 
same location touch not as simple as
just<00:01:24.310> to<00:01:24.430> say<00:01:24.610> well<00:01:24.850> the<00:01:25.420> bats<00:01:25.630> traveling<00:01:26.110> a

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
just to say well the bats traveling a

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.870 
just to say well the bats traveling a
little<00:01:26.409> bit<00:01:26.530> sideways<00:01:26.799> therefore<00:01:27.610> there<00:01:27.759> must

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
little bit sideways therefore there must

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.950 
little bit sideways therefore there must
be<00:01:28.090> some<00:01:28.390> side<00:01:29.020> spin<00:01:29.289> on<00:01:29.380> the<00:01:29.530> ball<00:01:30.689> because<00:01:31.689> it

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
be some side spin on the ball because it

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.109 
be some side spin on the ball because it
actually<00:01:32.079> looks<00:01:32.350> quite<00:01:32.590> similar<00:01:33.159> it's<00:01:34.030> a

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
actually looks quite similar it's a

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.300 
actually looks quite similar it's a
little<00:01:34.359> bit<00:01:34.450> easier<00:01:34.780> to<00:01:34.840> tell<00:01:35.140> in<00:01:35.259> person<00:01:35.740> you

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
little bit easier to tell in person you

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.859 
little bit easier to tell in person you
can<00:01:36.340> see<00:01:36.729> it<00:01:36.850> a<00:01:36.909> little<00:01:37.060> bit<00:01:37.180> easier<00:01:37.509> that<00:01:37.750> the

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
can see it a little bit easier that the

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.990 
can see it a little bit easier that the
player<00:01:38.380> is<00:01:38.649> coming<00:01:39.430> around<00:01:39.640> the<00:01:39.789> ball<00:01:39.969> and

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
player is coming around the ball and

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.420 
player is coming around the ball and
contact<00:01:40.539> not<00:01:41.200> quite<00:01:41.500> so<00:01:41.710> easy<00:01:41.920> to<00:01:42.070> see<00:01:42.250> on<00:01:42.280> the

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
contact not quite so easy to see on the

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.910 
contact not quite so easy to see on the
video<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.810> we're<00:01:43.960> just<00:01:44.109> I'm<00:01:44.289> just<00:01:44.350> repeating

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
video and we're just I'm just repeating

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.760 
video and we're just I'm just repeating
the<00:01:45.130> sequence<00:01:46.000> of<00:01:46.119> strokes<00:01:46.450> here<00:01:46.689> just<00:01:47.140> while

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
the sequence of strokes here just while

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.310 
the sequence of strokes here just while
I<00:01:47.799> talk<00:01:48.670> about<00:01:49.210> a<00:01:49.240> couple<00:01:49.600> of<00:01:49.630> other<00:01:49.750> things

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
I talk about a couple of other things

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.910 
I talk about a couple of other things
with<00:01:50.500> reading<00:01:50.799> spin<00:01:52.079> usually<00:01:53.079> telling<00:01:53.770> the

type of spin isn't really the main

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.169 
type of spin isn't really the main
problem<00:01:56.679> except<00:01:57.250> for<00:01:57.429> perhaps<00:01:57.640> that<00:01:57.880> the

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
problem except for perhaps that the

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:02.340 
problem except for perhaps that the
exception<00:01:58.689> of<00:01:58.780> a<00:01:58.960> side<00:01:59.710> spin<00:01:59.920> top<00:02:00.310> spin<00:02:00.640> a<00:02:01.350> long

fast stroke where it can be a little bit
more<00:02:06.039> difficult<00:02:06.509> even<00:02:07.509> in<00:02:07.600> those<00:02:07.689> cases

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
more difficult even in those cases

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.059 
more difficult even in those cases
usually<00:02:08.580> in<00:02:09.580> actual<00:02:10.270> real<00:02:10.509> play<00:02:10.840> you<00:02:11.500> can<00:02:11.770> tell

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
usually in actual real play you can tell

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.070 
usually in actual real play you can tell
by<00:02:12.250> the<00:02:12.310> way<00:02:12.550> your<00:02:13.120> opponent's<00:02:13.599> holding<00:02:13.959> his

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
by the way your opponent's holding his

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.210 
by the way your opponent's holding his
racket<00:02:14.440> angle

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
racket angle

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.130 
racket angle
and<00:02:15.310> just<00:02:15.640> that<00:02:15.850> the<00:02:16.060> type<00:02:16.330> of<00:02:16.360> Swing<00:02:16.780> that<00:02:17.020> is

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
and just that the type of Swing that is

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.560 
and just that the type of Swing that is
coming<00:02:17.380> around<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.770> ball<00:02:18.000> but<00:02:19.000> other<00:02:19.120> clues

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
coming around the ball but other clues

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.840 
coming around the ball but other clues
to<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:20.020> amount<00:02:20.320> of<00:02:20.410> spin<00:02:20.740> on<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.430> ball<00:02:21.580> will

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
to the amount of spin on the ball will

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.970 
to the amount of spin on the ball will
be<00:02:21.970> stuff<00:02:22.240> like<00:02:22.270> the<00:02:22.600> flight<00:02:22.840> path<00:02:22.870> and<00:02:23.860> you

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
be stuff like the flight path and you

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.550 
be stuff like the flight path and you
can<00:02:24.130> see<00:02:24.310> here<00:02:24.610> that<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:25.600> ball<00:02:25.840> is<00:02:25.870> curving<00:02:26.470> in

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
can see here that the ball is curving in

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.800 
can see here that the ball is curving in
flight<00:02:26.890> which<00:02:27.310> would<00:02:27.490> give<00:02:27.640> you<00:02:27.730> some<00:02:27.970> pretty

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
flight which would give you some pretty

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.060 
flight which would give you some pretty
good<00:02:28.960> indication<00:02:29.350> that<00:02:29.650> there's<00:02:29.860> some

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
good indication that there's some

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.070 
good indication that there's some
significant<00:02:30.730> sights<00:02:30.970> been<00:02:31.210> on<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.420> ball<00:02:31.600> and

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
significant sights been on the ball and

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.830 
significant sights been on the ball and
again<00:02:32.620> this<00:02:32.860> is<00:02:33.040> much<00:02:33.250> easier<00:02:33.970> to<00:02:34.090> see<00:02:34.300> in<00:02:34.630> a

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
again this is much easier to see in a

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.770 
again this is much easier to see in a
real<00:02:35.020> match<00:02:35.200> rather<00:02:35.590> than<00:02:35.740> on<00:02:35.860> video<00:02:36.780> the

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
real match rather than on video the

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.610 
real match rather than on video the
players<00:02:38.350> racket<00:02:38.860> angle<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.370> swing<00:02:40.620> direction

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
players racket angle and swing direction

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.920 
players racket angle and swing direction
will<00:02:41.770> give<00:02:41.950> you<00:02:42.040> some<00:02:42.250> clues<00:02:42.600> it's<00:02:43.600> a<00:02:43.630> little

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
will give you some clues it's a little

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.720 
will give you some clues it's a little
bit<00:02:44.050> more<00:02:44.200> easy<00:02:44.410> to<00:02:44.500> see<00:02:44.770> in<00:02:44.950> person<00:02:45.130> how

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
bit more easy to see in person how

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.699 
bit more easy to see in person how
that's<00:02:45.940> going<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.450> sound<00:02:47.200> of<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.380> ball<00:02:47.530> will

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
that's going the sound of the ball will

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:54.240 
that's going the sound of the ball will
give<00:02:47.860> you<00:02:47.920> some<00:02:48.130> clues<00:02:48.400> as<00:02:49.390> well<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:53.220> what<00:02:54.220> I

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
give you some clues as well and what I

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.900 
give you some clues as well and what I
mean<00:02:54.520> by<00:02:54.700> that<00:02:54.730> is<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:56.350> ball<00:02:56.590> itself<00:02:57.190> makes<00:02:57.790> a

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
mean by that is the ball itself makes a

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.750 
mean by that is the ball itself makes a
different<00:02:58.209> sound<00:02:58.240> depending<00:02:59.020> on<00:02:59.170> whether

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
different sound depending on whether

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.730 
different sound depending on whether
it's<00:03:00.760> been<00:03:01.000> contacted<00:03:01.630> very<00:03:01.810> solid<00:03:02.320> and<00:03:02.440> flat

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
it's been contacted very solid and flat

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.970 
it's been contacted very solid and flat
this<00:03:03.100> is<00:03:03.160> very<00:03:03.630> brushed<00:03:04.630> skimmed<00:03:05.380> and<00:03:05.620> very

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
this is very brushed skimmed and very

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.510 
this is very brushed skimmed and very
spindly<00:03:06.520> if<00:03:07.060> you<00:03:07.450> hear<00:03:07.720> a<00:03:07.750> sharp<00:03:08.520> cracking

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
spindly if you hear a sharp cracking

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.760 
spindly if you hear a sharp cracking
sound<00:03:09.910> it's<00:03:10.270> probably<00:03:10.780> fairly<00:03:11.110> flat<00:03:11.290> contact

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
sound it's probably fairly flat contact

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.370 
sound it's probably fairly flat contact
and<00:03:11.920> a<00:03:12.010> lot<00:03:12.190> of<00:03:12.280> spin<00:03:12.550> if<00:03:13.390> you<00:03:13.660> hear<00:03:14.050> the<00:03:14.200> ball

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
and a lot of spin if you hear the ball

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.190 
and a lot of spin if you hear the ball
is<00:03:14.650> much<00:03:15.220> softer<00:03:15.610> contact<00:03:16.330> it<00:03:16.570> sounds<00:03:17.050> much

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
is much softer contact it sounds much

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.290 
is much softer contact it sounds much
softer<00:03:17.590> it's<00:03:18.160> much<00:03:18.400> more<00:03:18.640> likely<00:03:19.000> to<00:03:19.030> be<00:03:19.269> a

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
softer it's much more likely to be a

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.500 
softer it's much more likely to be a
heavy<00:03:19.630> spin<00:03:19.989> ball<00:03:20.610> of<00:03:21.610> course<00:03:21.910> the<00:03:22.060> speed<00:03:22.330> of

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
heavy spin ball of course the speed of

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.120 
heavy spin ball of course the speed of
the<00:03:22.600> ball<00:03:22.780> itself<00:03:23.110> compared<00:03:23.620> to<00:03:23.739> the<00:03:23.830> racket

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
the ball itself compared to the racket

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.000 
the ball itself compared to the racket
speed<00:03:24.790> will<00:03:25.239> give<00:03:25.390> you<00:03:25.510> another<00:03:25.720> clue<00:03:26.080> if<00:03:26.800> the

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
speed will give you another clue if the

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.490 
speed will give you another clue if the
racket<00:03:27.310> is<00:03:27.430> moving<00:03:27.790> very<00:03:27.820> fast<00:03:28.360> but<00:03:29.140> the<00:03:29.290> ball

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
racket is moving very fast but the ball

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.250 
racket is moving very fast but the ball
comes<00:03:30.130> off<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.430> racket<00:03:30.580> very<00:03:30.880> slowly<00:03:31.269> then

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
comes off the racket very slowly then

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.660 
comes off the racket very slowly then
you're<00:03:32.620> likely<00:03:32.860> to<00:03:33.010> have<00:03:33.100> a<00:03:33.160> very<00:03:33.489> heavy<00:03:33.760> spin

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
you're likely to have a very heavy spin

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.020 
you're likely to have a very heavy spin
so<00:03:36.670> that<00:03:36.910> that<00:03:37.209> can<00:03:37.330> be<00:03:37.480> much<00:03:37.690> easier<00:03:37.750> to<00:03:38.230> tell

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
so that that can be much easier to tell

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.300 
so that that can be much easier to tell
what<00:03:40.030> becomes<00:03:40.540> a<00:03:40.870> little<00:03:41.170> bit<00:03:41.290> harder<00:03:41.739> to<00:03:41.920> tell

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
what becomes a little bit harder to tell

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.100 
what becomes a little bit harder to tell
us<00:03:42.459> when<00:03:42.640> the<00:03:42.760> racket<00:03:43.060> is<00:03:43.150> moved<00:03:43.390> fast<00:03:43.690> and<00:03:44.049> the

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
us when the racket is moved fast and the

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.430 
us when the racket is moved fast and the
ball<00:03:44.290> comes<00:03:44.530> off<00:03:44.739> fairly<00:03:45.549> fast<00:03:46.110> what<00:03:47.110> you<00:03:47.230> have

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
ball comes off fairly fast what you have

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.110 
ball comes off fairly fast what you have
then<00:03:47.650> is<00:03:47.830> it's<00:03:48.040> easy<00:03:48.250> to<00:03:48.459> know<00:03:48.640> that<00:03:48.910> it's<00:03:49.030> a

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
then is it's easy to know that it's a

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.750 
then is it's easy to know that it's a
topspin<00:03:49.840> or<00:03:49.900> backspin<00:03:50.410> ball<00:03:50.470> but<00:03:51.430> it<00:03:51.519> can<00:03:51.670> be

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
topspin or backspin ball but it can be

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.150 
topspin or backspin ball but it can be
very<00:03:51.970> very<00:03:52.150> hard<00:03:52.420> to<00:03:52.540> tell<00:03:52.750> just<00:03:52.989> exactly<00:03:53.709> how

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
very very hard to tell just exactly how

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.850 
very very hard to tell just exactly how
much<00:03:54.400> topspin<00:03:55.390> or<00:03:55.660> how<00:03:55.989> much<00:03:56.170> backspin<00:03:56.650> zhan

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
much topspin or how much backspin zhan

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.910 
much topspin or how much backspin zhan
is<00:03:57.280> it<00:03:57.519> a<00:03:57.610> medium<00:03:58.090> medium<00:03:58.810> heavy<00:03:59.019> or<00:03:59.590> heavy

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
is it a medium medium heavy or heavy

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.190 
is it a medium medium heavy or heavy
amount<00:04:00.250> of<00:04:00.340> spin<00:04:00.580> that<00:04:01.239> can<00:04:01.420> be<00:04:01.540> much<00:04:01.989> more

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
amount of spin that can be much more

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.270

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.210 

as<00:04:17.590> you<00:04:18.489> continue<00:04:18.970> to<00:04:19.120> play<00:04:19.659> and<00:04:20.079> play<00:04:21.039> more

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
as you continue to play and play more

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.760 
as you continue to play and play more
table<00:04:21.549> tennis<00:04:21.729> you'll<00:04:22.569> naturally<00:04:23.169> start<00:04:23.710> to

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
table tennis you'll naturally start to

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.179 
table tennis you'll naturally start to
pick<00:04:24.039> up<00:04:24.300> the<00:04:25.300> relationship<00:04:25.990> between<00:04:26.189> your

pick up the relationship between your

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:30.659 
pick up the relationship between your
opponent's<00:04:27.729> swing<00:04:28.180> his<00:04:28.719> bad<00:04:28.990> angles<00:04:29.439> and<00:04:29.710> the

opponent's swing his bad angles and the

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.749 
opponent's swing his bad angles and the
spin<00:04:30.939> that's<00:04:31.120> produced<00:04:31.629> so<00:04:32.620> the<00:04:33.460> more<00:04:33.639> you

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 
spin that's produced so the more you

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:34.920 
spin that's produced so the more you
play<00:04:33.969> the<00:04:34.000> better<00:04:34.330> you'll<00:04:34.509> get<00:04:34.659> at<00:04:34.719> reading

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
play the better you'll get at reading

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.890 
play the better you'll get at reading
speed<00:04:35.520> but<00:04:36.520> if<00:04:36.699> you<00:04:36.819> use<00:04:37.000> that<00:04:37.210> the<00:04:37.449> real

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
speed but if you use that the real

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.709 
speed but if you use that the real
fundamentals<00:04:38.620> of<00:04:38.860> what<00:04:39.610> direction<00:04:39.969> is<00:04:40.389> the

on the ball and all of these things will
give<00:05:05.919> you<00:05:06.039> some<00:05:06.340> sort<00:05:06.580> of<00:05:06.610> clue<00:05:06.969> along<00:05:07.629> with<00:05:07.780> of
