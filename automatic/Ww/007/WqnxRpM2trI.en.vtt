in<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.710> black<00:01:52.979> position<00:01:53.220> here<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:54.450> just<00:01:54.479> let's

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
in the black position here so just let's

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.380 
in the black position here so just let's
try<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.350> picture<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.740> scenario<00:01:56.280> is<00:01:57.090> quite

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
try and picture the scenario is quite

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.880 
try and picture the scenario is quite
earlier<00:01:57.719> in<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.960> game<00:01:58.170> we<00:01:58.530> don't<00:01:58.710> know

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
earlier in the game we don't know

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.620 
earlier in the game we don't know
roughly<00:01:59.460> what<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.670> clock<00:01:59.909> times<00:02:00.210> are<00:02:00.390> but<00:02:00.540> I'm

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
roughly what the clock times are but I'm

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.880 
roughly what the clock times are but I'm
going<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.840> assume<00:02:00.960> now<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.409> both<00:02:01.710> players

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
going to assume now that both players

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.069 
going to assume now that both players
are<00:02:02.159> still<00:02:02.340> got<00:02:02.579> quite<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.570> lot<00:02:03.659> of<00:02:03.750> time<00:02:03.869> on

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
are still got quite a lot of time on

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.280 
are still got quite a lot of time on

chances<00:03:08.360> are<00:03:08.510> I'm<00:03:08.900> almost<00:03:09.170> definitely<00:03:09.740> going

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
chances are I'm almost definitely going

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.370 
chances are I'm almost definitely going
to<00:03:09.920> lose<00:03:10.130> I<00:03:10.400> mean<00:03:10.910> it's<00:03:11.150> really<00:03:11.450> gonna<00:03:11.750> be<00:03:12.080> very

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
to lose I mean it's really gonna be very

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.780 
to lose I mean it's really gonna be very
tough<00:03:12.620> for<00:03:12.680> black<00:03:13.010> to<00:03:13.160> get<00:03:13.280> anything<00:03:13.520> from

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
tough for black to get anything from

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.420 
tough for black to get anything from
this<00:03:13.970> position<00:03:14.680> so<00:03:15.680> if<00:03:15.950> we<00:03:16.040> go<00:03:16.160> back<00:03:16.310> to<00:03:16.340> the

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
this position so if we go back to the

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.400 
this position so if we go back to the
position<00:03:16.550> after<00:03:16.790> Knight<00:03:16.910> takes<00:03:17.090> g7<00:03:17.900> you

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
position after Knight takes g7 you

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.170 
position after Knight takes g7 you
should<00:03:18.560> be<00:03:18.680> thinking<00:03:19.040> in<00:03:19.130> your<00:03:19.250> mind<00:03:19.310> if<00:03:20.000> you

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
should be thinking in your mind if you

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.540 
should be thinking in your mind if you
have<00:03:20.209> to<00:03:20.540> play<00:03:20.690> a<00:03:20.720> move<00:03:20.930> right<00:03:20.959> 98<00:03:21.500> it's<00:03:22.400> not

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
have to play a move right 98 it's not

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:23.979 
have to play a move right 98 it's not
the<00:03:22.820> equivalent<00:03:23.000> of<00:03:23.180> resigning<00:03:23.690> but<00:03:23.870> you're

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
the equivalent of resigning but you're

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.990 
the equivalent of resigning but you're
really<00:03:24.260> really<00:03:24.650> very<00:03:25.190> likely<00:03:25.430> to<00:03:25.640> lose<00:03:25.820> that

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
really really very likely to lose that

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.759 
really really very likely to lose that
position<00:03:26.510> you're<00:03:27.110> playing<00:03:27.320> someone<00:03:27.650> who's

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
position you're playing someone who's

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:29.110 
position you're playing someone who's
200<00:03:28.130> points<00:03:28.340> higher<00:03:28.489> than<00:03:28.519> you<00:03:28.820> and<00:03:29.030> you're

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
200 points higher than you and you're

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.820 
200 points higher than you and you're
just<00:03:29.150> accepting<00:03:29.900> a<00:03:29.959> position<00:03:30.050> where<00:03:30.500> you're<00:03:30.650> a

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
just accepting a position where you're a

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.190 
just accepting a position where you're a

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
porn down and a very important point

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.550 
porn down and a very important point
that<00:03:33.530> so<00:03:34.489> if<00:03:34.880> it<00:03:35.180> was<00:03:35.360> up<00:03:35.540> to<00:03:35.600> me<00:03:35.930> now<00:03:36.140> I<00:03:36.170> would

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
that so if it was up to me now I would

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.140 
that so if it was up to me now I would
be<00:03:36.590> desperately<00:03:37.430> looking<00:03:37.790> for<00:03:38.000> another

be desperately looking for another

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.540 
be desperately looking for another
alternative<00:03:38.390> I<00:03:39.080> mean<00:03:39.500> always<00:03:39.650> be<00:03:40.100> willing<00:03:40.430> to

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
alternative I mean always be willing to

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.729 
alternative I mean always be willing to
spend<00:03:40.790> a<00:03:41.030> large<00:03:41.600> amount<00:03:41.750> of<00:03:42.049> my<00:03:42.170> time<00:03:42.440> in<00:03:42.650> this

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
spend a large amount of my time in this

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:44.199 
spend a large amount of my time in this
position<00:03:42.950> to<00:03:43.670> try<00:03:43.820> and<00:03:43.970> find<00:03:44.120> another

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
position to try and find another

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.960 
position to try and find another
alternative<00:03:44.420> and<00:03:45.350> if<00:03:45.980> I<00:03:46.160> calculated<00:03:46.640> alive

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
alternative and if I calculated alive

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.330 
alternative and if I calculated alive
which<00:03:47.150> I<00:03:47.299> thought<00:03:47.510> looked<00:03:47.570> even<00:03:48.560> as<00:03:48.950> even<00:03:49.220> like

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
which I thought looked even as even like

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.850 
which I thought looked even as even like
50<00:03:49.760> percent<00:03:50.030> sure<00:03:50.209> they<00:03:50.420> survived<00:03:50.900> then<00:03:51.830> I

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
50 percent sure they survived then I

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.170 
50 percent sure they survived then I
would<00:03:52.010> definitely<00:03:52.430> go<00:03:52.549> for<00:03:52.580> it<00:03:52.760> because<00:03:53.060> the

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
would definitely go for it because the

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.630 
would definitely go for it because the
alternatives<00:03:53.660> so<00:03:53.810> bad<00:03:54.280> so<00:03:55.280> in<00:03:55.340> this<00:03:55.430> position

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
alternatives so bad so in this position

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.820 
alternatives so bad so in this position
the<00:03:56.209> sort<00:03:56.450> of<00:03:56.510> critical<00:03:57.019> moves<00:03:57.320> obviously<00:03:57.739> the

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
the sort of critical moves obviously the

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.690 
the sort of critical moves obviously the
move<00:03:57.950> King<00:03:58.190> takes<00:03:58.430> g7<00:03:59.060> and<00:04:00.459> in<00:04:01.459> my<00:04:01.610> opinion

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
move King takes g7 and in my opinion

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.460 
move King takes g7 and in my opinion
unless<00:04:02.120> you<00:04:02.360> kind<00:04:02.540> of<00:04:02.660> see<00:04:03.230> that<00:04:03.350> you're

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
unless you kind of see that you're

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.259 
unless you kind of see that you're
getting<00:04:03.590> mated<00:04:04.010> in<00:04:04.130> this<00:04:04.280> position<00:04:04.700> King

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
getting mated in this position King

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.650 
getting mated in this position King
takes<00:04:05.510> g7<00:04:06.019> is<00:04:06.110> a<00:04:06.140> better<00:04:06.350> option<00:04:06.560> than<00:04:06.790> 98<00:04:07.790> the

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
takes g7 is a better option than 98 the

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.180 
takes g7 is a better option than 98 the
reason<00:04:08.959> being<00:04:09.110> you<00:04:09.230> you're<00:04:09.650> winning<00:04:09.890> a<00:04:09.980> piece

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
reason being you you're winning a piece

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.910 
reason being you you're winning a piece
so<00:04:10.880> obviously<00:04:11.780> that's<00:04:11.930> a<00:04:12.049> good<00:04:12.200> thing<00:04:12.440> I<00:04:12.590> mean

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
so obviously that's a good thing I mean

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.220 
so obviously that's a good thing I mean
why<00:04:13.820> it's<00:04:13.970> going<00:04:14.090> to<00:04:14.150> get<00:04:14.450> an<00:04:14.540> attack<00:04:14.840> why<00:04:15.110> it's

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
why it's going to get an attack why it's

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.210 
why it's going to get an attack why it's
obviously<00:04:15.470> gotta<00:04:15.620> follow<00:04:15.769> up<00:04:15.860> with<00:04:16.010> the<00:04:16.100> move

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
obviously gotta follow up with the move

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.400 
obviously gotta follow up with the move
Queen<00:04:16.459> to<00:04:16.519> h6<00:04:16.760> check<00:04:17.299> and<00:04:17.660> now<00:04:17.959> you<00:04:18.019> have<00:04:18.260> to

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
Queen to h6 check and now you have to

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.070 
Queen to h6 check and now you have to
tread<00:04:19.070> carefully<00:04:19.100> if<00:04:19.640> you're<00:04:19.760> black<00:04:19.970> but<00:04:20.600> it's

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
tread carefully if you're black but it's

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.050 
tread carefully if you're black but it's
worth<00:04:21.289> the<00:04:21.500> gamble<00:04:21.650> because<00:04:22.250> as<00:04:22.520> I<00:04:22.580> saying<00:04:22.880> the

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
worth the gamble because as I saying the

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.170 
worth the gamble because as I saying the
alternative<00:04:23.570> is<00:04:23.810> he's<00:04:24.590> not<00:04:24.830> very<00:04:24.950> appealing

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
alternative is he's not very appealing

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.060 
alternative is he's not very appealing
in<00:04:26.360> this<00:04:26.510> position<00:04:26.720> black<00:04:27.500> probably<00:04:27.770> has<00:04:27.949> to

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
in this position black probably has to

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.670 
in this position black probably has to
play<00:04:28.190> the<00:04:28.250> move<00:04:28.430> King<00:04:28.639> tha<00:04:29.210> then<00:04:29.870> King<00:04:30.260> g8

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
play the move King tha then King g8

and unfortunately black just doesn't

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.420

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
have a defense to that

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.810 
have a defense to that
for<00:05:05.360> example<00:05:05.720> Knight<00:05:05.900> g7<00:05:06.590> would<00:05:07.490> run<00:05:07.669> into

for example Knight g7 would run into

for example Knight g7 would run into

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
coming on the next move so okay you'd

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.540

unless suppose you just couldn't even
analyze<00:05:20.300> that<00:05:20.570> line<00:05:20.750> so<00:05:20.990> you're<00:05:21.110> 50/50<00:05:21.770> that

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
analyze that line so you're 50/50 that

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:24.370

King<00:05:33.229> h8<00:05:33.590> is<00:05:34.250> the<00:05:34.430> best<00:05:34.639> move<00:05:34.880> and<00:05:35.150> after<00:05:35.510> that

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660 
King h8 is the best move and after that

King h8 is the best move and after that
white<00:05:36.410> pony<00:05:36.590> will<00:05:36.830> follow<00:05:37.010> up<00:05:37.099> with<00:05:37.130> Knight<00:05:37.400> g5

d7 probably defends the matrix and it

why it's got a dilemma
B<00:06:19.099> takes<00:06:19.340> f6<00:06:19.729> threatens<00:06:20.270> the<00:06:20.539> the<00:06:20.870> mate<00:06:21.080> and

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:21.380 
B takes f6 threatens the the mate and

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.520 
B takes f6 threatens the the mate and
also<00:06:22.039> has<00:06:22.220> some<00:06:22.370> ideas<00:06:22.669> to<00:06:22.789> push<00:06:22.970> the<00:06:23.120> pawn<00:06:23.330> on

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:23.530 
also has some ideas to push the pawn on

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.379 
also has some ideas to push the pawn on
but<00:06:24.530> Queen<00:06:24.919> d7<00:06:25.070> actually<00:06:25.639> stops<00:06:25.940> both<00:06:26.210> of

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:26.389 
but Queen d7 actually stops both of

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:28.540 
but Queen d7 actually stops both of
those<00:06:26.479> threats<00:06:26.870> and<00:06:27.110> in<00:06:27.949> fact<00:06:28.160> black<00:06:28.280> might

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:28.550 
those threats and in fact black might

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:29.920 
those threats and in fact black might
even<00:06:28.699> be<00:06:28.940> better<00:06:28.970> in<00:06:29.300> this<00:06:29.360> position<00:06:29.810> but

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930 
even be better in this position but

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.070 
even be better in this position but
certainly<00:06:30.289> black<00:06:30.800> seems<00:06:31.010> to<00:06:31.190> be<00:06:31.280> doing<00:06:31.430> okay

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.080 
certainly black seems to be doing okay

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.060 
certainly black seems to be doing okay
which<00:06:33.080> means<00:06:33.289> white<00:06:33.560> would<00:06:33.710> have<00:06:33.830> to<00:06:33.919> play

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.070 
which means white would have to play

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.850 
which means white would have to play
that<00:06:34.190> if<00:06:34.280> Queen<00:06:34.520> takes<00:06:34.700> f6<00:06:35.210> and<00:06:35.620> after<00:06:36.620> Queen

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:36.860 
that if Queen takes f6 and after Queen

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.370 
that if Queen takes f6 and after Queen
takes<00:06:37.099> f6<00:06:37.550> I<00:06:37.849> think<00:06:38.300> what<00:06:38.990> it<00:06:39.050> doesn't<00:06:39.200> have

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:39.380 
takes f6 I think what it doesn't have

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:39.700 
takes f6 I think what it doesn't have
much

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:39.710 
much

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.820 
much
rather<00:06:39.860> than<00:06:40.100> taking<00:06:40.460> a<00:06:40.550> perpetual<00:06:41.120> check<00:06:41.390> now

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:41.830 
rather than taking a perpetual check now

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.140 
rather than taking a perpetual check now
something<00:06:42.830> like<00:06:42.860> this

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:44.150 
something like this

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:45.400 
something like this
the<00:06:44.360> main<00:06:44.540> problem<00:06:44.840> was<00:06:44.900> although<00:06:45.080> the<00:06:45.230> white

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:45.410 
the main problem was although the white

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:47.410 
the main problem was although the white
queen<00:06:45.680> is<00:06:45.800> fantastically<00:06:46.460> well<00:06:46.700> placed<00:06:47.000> and

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:47.420 
queen is fantastically well placed and

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.990 
queen is fantastically well placed and
black<00:06:47.870> kings<00:06:48.110> may<00:06:48.260> open<00:06:48.680> these<00:06:49.460> rooks<00:06:49.760> you

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.000 
black kings may open these rooks you

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000 
black kings may open these rooks you
know<00:06:50.120> they're<00:06:50.570> quite<00:06:50.840> far<00:06:51.110> away<00:06:51.260> from<00:06:51.380> coming

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.010 
know they're quite far away from coming

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:53.890 
know they're quite far away from coming
to<00:06:52.100> the<00:06:52.190> attack<00:06:52.460> so<00:06:52.760> blacks<00:06:53.480> going<00:06:53.690> to<00:06:53.750> get

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:53.900 
to the attack so blacks going to get

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.250 
to the attack so blacks going to get
some<00:06:54.110> time<00:06:54.350> to<00:06:54.380> a<00:06:54.680> defender<00:06:55.370> King<00:06:55.930> so<00:06:56.930> in<00:06:57.080> fact

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:57.260 
some time to a defender King so in fact

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.130 
some time to a defender King so in fact
the<00:06:57.860> position<00:06:58.250> after<00:06:58.520> King<00:06:59.210> takes<00:06:59.450> g7<00:06:59.930> is<00:07:00.020> in

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:00.140 
the position after King takes g7 is in

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.500 
the position after King takes g7 is in
fact<00:07:00.320> probably<00:07:00.980> okay<00:07:01.340> for<00:07:01.550> black<00:07:01.730> certainly

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:02.510 
fact probably okay for black certainly

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:04.180 
fact probably okay for black certainly
in<00:07:02.570> a<00:07:02.630> practical<00:07:03.140> sense<00:07:03.380> you've<00:07:03.830> got<00:07:03.980> some

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:04.190 
in a practical sense you've got some

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.670 
in a practical sense you've got some
chances<00:07:04.610> if<00:07:04.730> you<00:07:04.820> play<00:07:04.970> King<00:07:05.150> takes<00:07:05.390> g7<00:07:05.990> so<00:07:06.590> you

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:06.680 
chances if you play King takes g7 so you

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.650 
chances if you play King takes g7 so you
just<00:07:06.890> have<00:07:07.010> a<00:07:07.040> try<00:07:07.340> and<00:07:07.670> come<00:07:08.150> up<00:07:08.180> with<00:07:08.300> a<00:07:08.420> move

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:08.660 
just have a try and come up with a move

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:09.730 
just have a try and come up with a move
which<00:07:08.840> gives<00:07:09.050> you<00:07:09.110> the<00:07:09.170> best<00:07:09.350> practical

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:09.740 
which gives you the best practical

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.550 
which gives you the best practical
chance<00:07:10.100> in<00:07:10.280> any<00:07:10.460> situation<00:07:11.150> now<00:07:12.110> in<00:07:12.230> fact<00:07:12.380> they

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 
chance in any situation now in fact they

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.020 
chance in any situation now in fact they
was<00:07:12.710> actually<00:07:12.950> move<00:07:13.160> the<00:07:13.340> black<00:07:13.550> can<00:07:13.700> play<00:07:13.730> in

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:14.030 
was actually move the black can play in

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:15.580 
was actually move the black can play in
this<00:07:14.090> position<00:07:14.240> which<00:07:14.630> probably<00:07:15.200> leads<00:07:15.410> to<00:07:15.470> an

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:15.590 
this position which probably leads to an

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.160 
this position which probably leads to an
advantage<00:07:16.040> for<00:07:16.220> black<00:07:16.540> so<00:07:17.540> I<00:07:17.570> won't<00:07:17.930> actually

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:18.170 
advantage for black so I won't actually

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.500 
advantage for black so I won't actually
reveal<00:07:18.590> that<00:07:18.830> just<00:07:19.130> now<00:07:19.340> I'll<00:07:19.700> leave<00:07:20.150> that<00:07:20.210> as

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:20.510 
reveal that just now I'll leave that as

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:23.800 
reveal that just now I'll leave that as
part<00:07:20.810> of<00:07:20.960> the<00:07:21.230> DVD<00:07:22.130> so<00:07:22.820> hopefully<00:07:23.330> you<00:07:23.780> know

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:23.810 
part of the DVD so hopefully you know

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.780 
part of the DVD so hopefully you know
you<00:07:23.960> can<00:07:24.200> have<00:07:24.350> a<00:07:24.380> think<00:07:24.650> about<00:07:24.860> it<00:07:24.920> see<00:07:25.610> if<00:07:25.700> you

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:25.790 
you can have a think about it see if you

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:27.820 
you can have a think about it see if you
can<00:07:25.940> work<00:07:26.090> out<00:07:26.330> how<00:07:26.390> black<00:07:26.990> can<00:07:27.170> even<00:07:27.410> play<00:07:27.590> the

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:27.830 
can work out how black can even play the

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.550 
can work out how black can even play the
advantage<00:07:28.310> my<00:07:29.300> one<00:07:29.480> hint<00:07:29.780> is<00:07:29.990> that<00:07:30.200> you<00:07:30.350> want

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:30.560 
advantage my one hint is that you want

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.620 
advantage my one hint is that you want
to<00:07:30.680> try<00:07:30.890> and<00:07:31.010> get<00:07:31.130> this<00:07:31.280> Queen<00:07:31.670> over<00:07:32.420> to<00:07:32.540> the

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:32.630 
to try and get this Queen over to the

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:35.590 
to try and get this Queen over to the
King<00:07:32.840> side<00:07:33.080> somewhere<00:07:33.470> like<00:07:33.620> here<00:07:33.650> and<00:07:34.420> if<00:07:35.420> you

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:35.600 
King side somewhere like here and if you

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.300 
King side somewhere like here and if you
can<00:07:35.750> try<00:07:35.960> and<00:07:36.080> find<00:07:36.260> an<00:07:36.470> effective<00:07:37.070> way<00:07:37.280> for

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:37.310 
can try and find an effective way for

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:39.490 
can try and find an effective way for
getting<00:07:37.670> the<00:07:37.850> Queen's<00:07:38.090> the<00:07:38.210> King<00:07:38.510> side<00:07:38.780> maybe

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:39.500 
getting the Queen's the King side maybe

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.260 
getting the Queen's the King side maybe
taking<00:07:40.160> advantage<00:07:40.580> of<00:07:40.640> the<00:07:40.730> fact<00:07:40.910> that<00:07:41.060> the

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:41.270 
taking advantage of the fact that the

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.240 
taking advantage of the fact that the
white<00:07:41.450> king<00:07:41.690> is<00:07:41.840> still<00:07:41.900> in<00:07:42.080> the<00:07:42.170> center<00:07:42.350> you

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:43.250 
white king is still in the center you

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:44.740 
white king is still in the center you
might<00:07:43.400> be<00:07:43.490> able<00:07:43.550> to<00:07:43.670> find<00:07:44.150> a<00:07:44.270> way<00:07:44.390> of<00:07:44.510> actually

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:44.750 
might be able to find a way of actually

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:47.020 
might be able to find a way of actually
getting<00:07:44.990> the<00:07:45.200> advantage<00:07:45.620> for<00:07:45.740> black<00:07:46.030> but

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:47.030 
getting the advantage for black but

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:48.790 
getting the advantage for black but
certainly<00:07:47.390> this<00:07:47.750> is<00:07:47.930> awful<00:07:48.260> just<00:07:48.470> goes<00:07:48.650> to

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:48.800 
certainly this is awful just goes to

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.340 
certainly this is awful just goes to
show<00:07:48.980> you've<00:07:49.490> really<00:07:50.030> got<00:07:50.240> to<00:07:50.450> play<00:07:50.930> moves

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:51.350 
show you've really got to play moves

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.350 
show you've really got to play moves
that<00:07:51.650> give<00:07:51.830> you<00:07:51.950> like<00:07:52.250> a<00:07:52.280> real<00:07:52.700> chance<00:07:53.090> of

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:53.360 
that give you like a real chance of

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.660 
that give you like a real chance of
getting<00:07:53.660> a<00:07:53.690> result<00:07:53.840> in<00:07:54.080> the<00:07:54.200> game<00:07:54.670> obviously

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:55.670 
getting a result in the game obviously

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:57.640 
getting a result in the game obviously
no<00:07:56.000> one<00:07:56.120> wasn't<00:07:56.300> look<00:07:56.540> stupid<00:07:57.020> you<00:07:57.230> know<00:07:57.590> you

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:57.650 
no one wasn't look stupid you know you

00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:59.200 
no one wasn't look stupid you know you
play<00:07:57.890> King<00:07:58.070> takes<00:07:58.280> g7<00:07:58.790> or<00:07:58.880> maybe<00:07:59.000> you<00:07:59.090> get

00:07:59.200 --> 00:07:59.210 
play King takes g7 or maybe you get

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:01.210 
play King takes g7 or maybe you get
mated<00:07:59.630> but<00:08:00.410> at<00:08:00.500> least<00:08:00.680> you've<00:08:00.860> given<00:08:01.160> yourself

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:01.220 
mated but at least you've given yourself

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.030 
mated but at least you've given yourself
a<00:08:01.520> chance<00:08:01.760> to<00:08:02.000> get<00:08:02.150> a<00:08:02.180> result<00:08:02.410> and<00:08:03.410> in<00:08:03.530> fact<00:08:03.740> if

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:04.040 
a chance to get a result and in fact if

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.490 
a chance to get a result and in fact if
you<00:08:04.070> if<00:08:04.700> black<00:08:05.390> Adela's<00:08:05.840> carefully<00:08:06.260> there's

you if black Adela's carefully there's

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.200 
you if black Adela's carefully there's
actually<00:08:06.800> an<00:08:07.220> even<00:08:07.340> stronger<00:08:07.700> move<00:08:08.030> thing

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:08.210 
actually an even stronger move thing

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:10.690 
actually an even stronger move thing
King<00:08:08.510> takes<00:08:08.690> g7<00:08:09.140> here<00:08:09.320> and<00:08:09.500> I'll<00:08:10.010> leave<00:08:10.490> it<00:08:10.520> up

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:10.700 
King takes g7 here and I'll leave it up

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.820 
King takes g7 here and I'll leave it up
to<00:08:10.730> the<00:08:11.000> viewers<00:08:11.360> to<00:08:11.480> try<00:08:11.690> and<00:08:11.930> find<00:08:12.470> out<00:08:12.650> what
