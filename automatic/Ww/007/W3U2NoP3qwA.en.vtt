00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
rides and we knew how good was the

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:38.469 
rides and we knew how good was the
design<00:01:37.130> and<00:01:37.459> how<00:01:37.520> good<00:01:37.819> was<00:01:38.000> the<00:01:38.090> cavity

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
design and how good was the cavity

00:01:38.479 --> 00:02:13.729 
design and how good was the cavity
that's<00:01:38.929> why<00:01:39.110> we<00:01:39.259> choose<00:01:39.439> my<00:01:39.679> cry

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.530 

when<00:02:14.280> we<00:02:14.430> decided<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:15.030> make<00:02:15.150> this<00:02:15.269> investment

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
when we decided to make this investment

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.020 
when we decided to make this investment
of<00:02:16.049> course<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.439> reason<00:02:16.620> why<00:02:16.890> was<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.609> increase

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
of course the reason why was to increase

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.640 
of course the reason why was to increase
the<00:02:18.299> attractivity<00:02:18.659> of<00:02:18.689> the<00:02:19.049> park<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.530> to

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
the attractivity of the park and to

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.110 
the attractivity of the park and to
develop<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.189> attendance<00:02:20.640> of<00:02:20.819> the<00:02:20.849> park

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
develop the attendance of the park

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.149 
develop the attendance of the park
that's<00:02:21.780> what<00:02:21.989> we<00:02:22.140> did<00:02:22.319> because<00:02:22.439> the<00:02:22.920> first

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
that's what we did because the first

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.149 
that's what we did because the first
year<00:02:23.459> we<00:02:24.060> increased<00:02:24.510> by<00:02:24.659> 8%<00:02:24.959> the<00:02:25.709> attendance

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
year we increased by 8% the attendance

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:28.459 
year we increased by 8% the attendance
of<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.340> park<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:26.849> by<00:02:27.000> 11%<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.840> turnover<00:02:28.319> and

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:28.469 
of the park and by 11% the turnover and

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:31.399 
of the park and by 11% the turnover and
this<00:02:29.250> added<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:30.060> all<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.719> reaction<00:02:31.170> very

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409 
this added to all the reaction very

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:33.709 
this added to all the reaction very
positive<00:02:31.859> reaction<00:02:31.980> of<00:02:32.340> visitors<00:02:32.849> we<00:02:33.540> knew

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
that with the spinning coaster Mike ride

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.890 
that with the spinning coaster Mike ride
we<00:02:36.389> have<00:02:36.689> had<00:02:37.109> made<00:02:37.409> the<00:02:37.799> attractivity<00:02:38.370> a<00:02:39.329> big

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
we have had made the attractivity a big

after that service is a very big deal
for<00:03:06.549> part<00:03:07.030> because<00:03:07.330> once<00:03:07.569> you<00:03:07.750> open<00:03:07.780> you

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
for part because once you open you

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.020 
for part because once you open you
absolutely<00:03:08.830> need<00:03:09.069> that<00:03:09.099> it<00:03:09.430> works<00:03:09.670> for<00:03:09.909> the

absolutely need that it works for the

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.300 
absolutely need that it works for the
cubic<00:03:10.330> but<00:03:10.840> we<00:03:11.049> knew<00:03:11.200> that<00:03:11.440> with<00:03:11.769> Mike<00:03:12.040> Reider

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
cubic but we knew that with Mike Reider

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.399 
cubic but we knew that with Mike Reider
we<00:03:13.030> could<00:03:13.239> have<00:03:13.390> a<00:03:13.420> very<00:03:13.690> high<00:03:13.989> level<00:03:14.200> of

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:16.110 
we could have a very high level of
satisfaction<00:03:14.650> speaking<00:03:15.549> about<00:03:15.670> absolute

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
satisfaction speaking about absolute

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.869 
satisfaction speaking about absolute
service<00:03:16.330> we<00:03:17.170> experimented<00:03:17.799> it<00:03:18.159> a<00:03:18.430> few<00:03:18.670> times

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879
