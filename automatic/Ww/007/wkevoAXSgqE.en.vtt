00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.580 
so let's select the tree and then click
on<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.900> very<00:01:52.140> proxy<00:01:52.530> icon

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
on the very proxy icon

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.770 
on the very proxy icon
in<00:01:54.950> the<00:01:55.159> dialog<00:01:55.460> box<00:01:55.520> give<00:01:55.939> the<00:01:56.060> proxy<00:01:56.450> name<00:01:56.630> of

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
in the dialog box give the proxy name of

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.570 
in the dialog box give the proxy name of
your<00:01:56.929> choice<00:01:57.049> and<00:01:57.320> then<00:01:57.710> click<00:01:57.920> OK

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
your choice and then click OK

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.250 
your choice and then click OK
let's<00:01:59.940> make<00:02:00.210> one<00:02:00.390> change<00:02:00.660> to<00:02:00.720> the<00:02:00.900> default

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260 
let's make one change to the default

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.350 
let's make one change to the default
settings<00:02:01.650> I'm<00:02:02.340> going<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.670> set<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.970> triangle

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
settings I'm going to set the triangle

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.170 
settings I'm going to set the triangle
count<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.720> the<00:02:03.840> preview<00:02:04.200> mesh<00:02:04.440> to<00:02:04.920> 200<00:02:05.460> this

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
count of the preview mesh to 200 this

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.670 
count of the preview mesh to 200 this
will<00:02:06.330> give<00:02:06.480> us<00:02:06.510> a<00:02:06.690> little<00:02:06.810> more<00:02:06.930> definition<00:02:07.230> of

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
will give us a little more definition of

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.660 
will give us a little more definition of
the<00:02:07.770> form<00:02:08.040> of<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.280> tree<00:02:09.619> then<00:02:10.619> click<00:02:11.280> OK<00:02:11.640> to

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
the form of the tree then click OK to

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.850 
the form of the tree then click OK to
finish<00:02:12.090> saving<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.450> proxy

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.190 

notice<00:02:16.820> that<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.300> original<00:02:17.570> model<00:02:18.050> is

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
notice that the original model is

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.360 
notice that the original model is
replaced<00:02:18.620> with<00:02:18.740> the<00:02:18.890> via<00:02:19.040> a<00:02:19.130> proxy

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
replaced with the via a proxy

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.930 
replaced with the via a proxy
automatically<00:02:21.250> let's<00:02:22.250> make<00:02:22.430> a<00:02:22.490> total<00:02:22.850> of

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
automatically let's make a total of

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.730 
automatically let's make a total of
thirty<00:02:23.120> six<00:02:23.360> copies<00:02:23.600> of<00:02:23.810> the<00:02:23.990> new<00:02:24.020> proxy<00:02:24.350> tree

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
thirty six copies of the new proxy tree

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.890 
thirty six copies of the new proxy tree
this<00:02:25.670> will<00:02:25.850> give<00:02:26.000> us<00:02:26.030> around<00:02:26.330> 10<00:02:26.660> million

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
this will give us around 10 million

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.590 
this will give us around 10 million
faces<00:02:27.260> in<00:02:27.530> this<00:02:27.650> model<00:02:28.120> even<00:02:29.120> with<00:02:29.270> this<00:02:29.390> many

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
faces in this model even with this many

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.300 
faces in this model even with this many
trees<00:02:29.900> there<00:02:30.440> is<00:02:30.530> little<00:02:30.800> change<00:02:31.040> to<00:02:31.220> the

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
trees there is little change to the

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.700 
trees there is little change to the
viewport<00:02:31.670> performance<00:02:35.140> now<00:02:36.140> let's<00:02:36.470> render

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
viewport performance now let's render

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:37.780 
viewport performance now let's render
the<00:02:36.860> model<00:02:37.160> and<00:02:37.280> while<00:02:37.460> we're<00:02:37.610> rendering

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
the model and while we're rendering

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.080 
the model and while we're rendering
let's<00:02:38.300> take<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:38.510> look<00:02:38.720> at<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:38.930> RAM<00:02:39.080> usage

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.000 

you<00:02:42.690> can<00:02:42.840> see<00:02:43.019> that<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:43.230> amount<00:02:43.560> of<00:02:43.650> ram<00:02:43.830> we

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
you can see that the amount of ram we

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.589 
you can see that the amount of ram we
were<00:02:44.099> using<00:02:44.280> is<00:02:44.580> pretty<00:02:44.819> low<00:02:44.970> considering<00:02:45.360> how

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
were using is pretty low considering how

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.500 
were using is pretty low considering how
many<00:02:45.660> faces<00:02:46.170> very<00:02:46.319> is<00:02:46.590> currently<00:02:46.860> processing

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
many faces very is currently processing

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.330 
many faces very is currently processing
to<00:02:48.510> top<00:02:48.720> that<00:02:48.870> off<00:02:48.930> as<00:02:49.379> you<00:02:49.920> can<00:02:50.069> see<00:02:50.220> the

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
to top that off as you can see the

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.650 
to top that off as you can see the
parsing<00:02:50.700> time<00:02:50.879> and<00:02:51.030> rendering<00:02:51.330> times<00:02:51.510> are

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
parsing time and rendering times are

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.790 
parsing time and rendering times are
both<00:02:51.810> very<00:02:51.989> fast<00:02:52.290> as<00:02:52.470> well<00:02:54.379> one<00:02:55.379> thing<00:02:55.560> to<00:02:55.590> keep

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
both very fast as well one thing to keep

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.350 
both very fast as well one thing to keep
in<00:02:55.920> mind<00:02:55.980> with<00:02:56.310> your<00:02:56.489> eye<00:02:56.550> proxy<00:02:56.879> files<00:02:57.120> is

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
in mind with your eye proxy files is

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.030 
in mind with your eye proxy files is
that<00:02:57.660> you<00:02:57.840> can<00:02:58.019> create<00:02:58.170> them<00:02:58.470> directly<00:02:58.799> within

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
that you can create them directly within

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.650 
that you can create them directly within
sketchup<00:02:59.549> or<00:02:59.730> you<00:02:59.849> can<00:02:59.970> also<00:03:00.150> create<00:03:00.390> and

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
sketchup or you can also create and

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.089 
sketchup or you can also create and
share<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.989> proxies<00:03:01.349> between<00:03:01.709> all<00:03:01.890> of<00:03:01.920> our

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
share the proxies between all of our

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.640 
share the proxies between all of our

addition to supporting via proxies in
this<00:03:09.900> new<00:03:10.049> version<00:03:10.230> we<00:03:10.709> have<00:03:10.739> also<00:03:10.980> optimize

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
this new version we have also optimize

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.089 
this new version we have also optimize
the<00:03:11.940> v-ray<00:03:12.239> core<00:03:12.480> so<00:03:13.019> that<00:03:13.170> vray<00:03:13.530> will<00:03:13.739> render

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
the v-ray core so that vray will render

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:15.680 
the v-ray core so that vray will render
dynamic<00:03:14.519> geometries<00:03:15.030> like<00:03:15.150> proxies<00:03:15.540> and

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
dynamic geometries like proxies and

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.270 
dynamic geometries like proxies and
displacement<00:03:16.230> much<00:03:16.650> faster

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.250 

as<00:03:21.370> you<00:03:21.910> can<00:03:22.000> see<00:03:22.180> in<00:03:22.270> this<00:03:22.360> image<00:03:22.420> with<00:03:23.170> the
