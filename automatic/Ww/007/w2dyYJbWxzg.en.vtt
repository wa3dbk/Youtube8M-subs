00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.250
 and you block the video for example we're going to 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:10.370
 go down 123 I say 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:14.500
 I say 1 2 3 4 5 to square the camera 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.500
 with the game once 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:31.490
 and we're going to play the weapons game every 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.199
 once we kill something every time we 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.800
 kill me I gave you the command it's going for me 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:39.800
 and your whistle no no 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.510
 simulating me if I kill not if they kill me 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.320
 he passed the command to you if they kill you 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.980
 you pass the command and if I kill you I'll 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.980
 you stay here 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:57.670
 I'm playing with a friend but you have 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.670
 idea of playing what happens 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:08.320
 when a game of weapons can greet them 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:08.320
 and friendly 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.909
 let's exhaust the slum for example this 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:20.310
 still 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:22.710
 I do not have a game but it's played 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.569
 I used to play, it's been a while since I played 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.250
 so I know I repeated the trick 

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:30.930
 keep a few times 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.370
 but we have to win it for 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.320
 raise the game 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.590
 so you have to give everything that 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.590
 have 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.260
 to see what map they have put us 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:50.580
 this map very badly for this is a 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.580
 shit to play to play 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.470
 Y 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.400
 best 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.939
 ostias 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.510
 we go 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.390
 but I'm going to use it to shoot with him 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.390
 you can run 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:42.099
 It's automatic 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.540
 you have to tell me when automatic 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.540
 when you do not know the weapon 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.430
 there is a decent life if it would be that I 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.879
 anyone 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.879
 because you do not have to be 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:09.970
 we are alive 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:09.970
 good up down 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.990
 this fuck 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.880
 a weapon 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.570
 and a low weapon 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.570

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.930

 children of the clouds 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.650
 I liked that we were not bad 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.660
 for teleportation 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.860
 Where else are you going down? 

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:35.240
