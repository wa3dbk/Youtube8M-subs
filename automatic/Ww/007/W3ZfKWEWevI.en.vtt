library<00:01:12.450> bags<00:01:12.780> when<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.260> was<00:01:13.530> in<00:01:13.680> primary

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
library bags when I was in primary

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.460 
library bags when I was in primary
school<00:01:14.040> but<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.640> would<00:01:15.030> assume<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.900> for<00:01:16.170> the

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
school but I would assume is for the

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.469 
school but I would assume is for the
shoes<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.130> can<00:01:17.400> keep<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.880> shoes<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.360> them

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
shoes so you can keep the shoes in them

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.030 
shoes so you can keep the shoes in them
and<00:01:18.750> stop<00:01:18.930> them<00:01:18.960> from<00:01:19.110> getting<00:01:19.530> really<00:01:19.680> dusty

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
and stop them from getting really dusty

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.760 
and stop them from getting really dusty
and<00:01:20.790> when<00:01:21.450> if<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.900> are<00:01:22.049> storing<00:01:22.350> them

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
and when if you are storing them

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.190 
and when if you are storing them
instead<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.580> having<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.880> massive<00:01:24.150> shoe<00:01:24.540> box<00:01:24.780> and

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
instead of having a massive shoe box and

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.190 
instead of having a massive shoe box and
so<00:01:25.710> both<00:01:25.979> shoes<00:01:26.369> are<00:01:26.850> in<00:01:27.119> these<00:01:27.600> little<00:01:27.840> mushy

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
so both shoes are in these little mushy

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.310 
so both shoes are in these little mushy
things<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.920> here<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:30.030> base<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:30.869> is<00:01:31.110> like

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
things and here is the base this is like

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.859 
things and here is the base this is like
a<00:01:31.530> monster<00:01:32.340> I'm<00:01:32.670> just<00:01:33.060> gonna<00:01:33.210> I'm<00:01:33.600> going<00:01:33.780> to

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
take out a little scratchy fluffy thing

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.260 
take out a little scratchy fluffy thing
so<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:37.770> can<00:01:37.950> see<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.369> properly<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.090> more

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
so you can see it properly and more

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.350 
so you can see it properly and more
authentically<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.920> there<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.280> go<00:01:41.490> look<00:01:42.030> at

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
authentically so there you go look at

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.749 
authentically so there you go look at
that<00:01:42.930> platform<00:01:43.470> like<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:43.979> this<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.460> size

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
that platform like this this is a size

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
berserk with my dress my dress was

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.560 
berserk with my dress my dress was
already<00:04:37.040> like<00:04:37.460> it<00:04:37.610> they<00:04:37.700> already<00:04:37.910> had<00:04:38.180> that<00:04:38.420> in

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
already like it they already had that in

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.480 
already like it they already had that in
stock<00:04:38.930> but<00:04:39.320> these<00:04:39.650> shoes<00:04:39.920> were<00:04:40.130> actually

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
stock but these shoes were actually

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.330 
stock but these shoes were actually
pre-order<00:04:41.120> so<00:04:41.480> when<00:04:41.870> I<00:04:41.900> ordered<00:04:42.500> all<00:04:42.710> my<00:04:42.980> stuff

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
pre-order so when I ordered all my stuff

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.390 
pre-order so when I ordered all my stuff
they<00:04:43.880> held<00:04:44.210> my<00:04:44.420> dress<00:04:44.750> and<00:04:44.960> ordered<00:04:45.830> the<00:04:46.070> shoes

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
they held my dress and ordered the shoes

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.910 
they held my dress and ordered the shoes
and<00:04:46.700> waited<00:04:47.540> to<00:04:47.720> mail<00:04:47.960> all<00:04:48.320> of<00:04:48.530> them<00:04:48.680> together

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:48.920 
and waited to mail all of them together

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.100 
and waited to mail all of them together
so<00:04:49.790> that<00:04:49.940> I<00:04:49.970> could<00:04:50.240> get<00:04:50.450> them<00:04:50.630> all<00:04:50.810> at<00:04:50.960> the<00:04:51.020> same

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
so that I could get them all at the same

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.840 
so that I could get them all at the same
time<00:04:51.320> it<00:04:51.830> didn't<00:04:52.100> really<00:04:52.220> take<00:04:52.520> me<00:04:52.670> that<00:04:52.790> long

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
time it didn't really take me that long

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.060 
time it didn't really take me that long
I<00:04:53.150> think<00:04:53.210> it<00:04:53.450> was<00:04:53.570> about<00:04:53.720> a<00:04:53.870> week<00:04:54.260> or<00:04:54.500> week<00:04:55.040> and

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
I think it was about a week or week and

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.890 
I think it was about a week or week and
a<00:04:55.250> half<00:04:55.430> or<00:04:55.700> something<00:04:56.060> and<00:04:56.210> I<00:04:56.300> think<00:04:56.390> that<00:04:56.720> is

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
a half or something and I think that is

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.410 
a half or something and I think that is
pretty<00:04:57.140> damn<00:04:57.440> good<00:04:57.710> because<00:04:58.070> usually

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:58.420 
pretty damn good because usually

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.940 
pretty damn good because usually
ordering<00:04:59.420> things<00:04:59.660> from<00:04:59.870> the<00:04:59.990> USA<00:05:00.440> for<00:05:00.710> some

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
ordering things from the USA for some

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.010 
ordering things from the USA for some
reason<00:05:01.460> take<00:05:02.030> forever

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
reason take forever

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.430 
reason take forever
these<00:05:03.290> also<00:05:03.530> cost<00:05:03.890> me<00:05:04.070> 79<00:05:05.050> Australian<00:05:06.050> dollars

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
these also cost me 79 Australian dollars

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.540 
these also cost me 79 Australian dollars
I'm<00:05:06.740> unsure<00:05:07.190> what<00:05:08.060> that<00:05:08.450> is<00:05:08.660> in<00:05:08.870> US<00:05:09.380> or<00:05:09.620> UK<00:05:09.950> or

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
I'm unsure what that is in US or UK or

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.640 
I'm unsure what that is in US or UK or
whatever<00:05:11.060> dollars<00:05:11.510> elsewhere<00:05:12.050> you<00:05:12.620> can

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
whatever dollars elsewhere you can

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.250 
whatever dollars elsewhere you can
google<00:05:13.220> that<00:05:13.250> but<00:05:13.700> in<00:05:13.880> Australia<00:05:14.540> because<00:05:14.750> my

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
google that but in Australia because my

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.100 
google that but in Australia because my
whole<00:05:15.530> order<00:05:15.920> was<00:05:16.160> over<00:05:16.700> a<00:05:16.730> certain<00:05:17.450> amount<00:05:17.810> of

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
whole order was over a certain amount of

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.010 
whole order was over a certain amount of
moola<00:05:19.040> I<00:05:19.280> think<00:05:19.490> it<00:05:19.580> was<00:05:19.670> like<00:05:19.790> over<00:05:20.150> 150<00:05:20.900> or

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
moola I think it was like over 150 or

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.560 
moola I think it was like over 150 or
something<00:05:21.440> I<00:05:21.590> got<00:05:22.400> free<00:05:22.640> express<00:05:23.060> shipping<00:05:23.270> so

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
that's probably why also came pretty

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.480 
that's probably why also came pretty
