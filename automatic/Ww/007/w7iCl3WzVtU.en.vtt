00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
makes it makes perfect sense I don't

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:48.830 
makes it makes perfect sense I don't
actually<00:03:47.220> see<00:03:47.790> any<00:03:47.819> of<00:03:48.120> wrap<00:03:48.359> up<00:03:48.480> I<00:03:48.660> see<00:03:48.810> a

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
actually see any of wrap up I see a

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.349 
actually see any of wrap up I see a
maggot<00:03:49.169> in<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:49.349> distance<00:03:49.739> so<00:03:50.669> I<00:03:50.699> believe<00:03:51.209> they

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
maggot in the distance so I believe they

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.240 
maggot in the distance so I believe they
have<00:03:51.449> a<00:03:51.480> really<00:03:51.690> high<00:03:51.810> drop<00:03:52.049> rate<00:03:52.260> of<00:03:52.440> dropping

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
the maggots but you can cook and eat for

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.110 
the maggots but you can cook and eat for

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
different colors too so they you know

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.240 
different colors too so they you know
they<00:04:30.020> put<00:04:30.140> some<00:04:30.320> effort<00:04:30.590> into<00:04:30.710> it<00:04:30.800> it's<00:04:31.040> good<00:04:31.220> I

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
they put some effort into it it's good I

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.050 
they put some effort into it it's good I
like<00:04:31.610> it

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
like it

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.460 
like it
so<00:04:32.420> we'll<00:04:32.540> kill<00:04:32.690> a<00:04:32.720> couple<00:04:32.870> of<00:04:33.050> these<00:04:33.170> and

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
so we'll kill a couple of these and

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.080 
so we'll kill a couple of these and
there<00:04:33.920> drop<00:04:34.190> some<00:04:34.370> right<00:04:34.520> there<00:04:34.700> that's<00:04:34.940> it

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
there drop some right there that's it

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.970 
there drop some right there that's it
give<00:04:35.930> a<00:04:35.960> couple<00:04:36.170> more<00:04:36.410> I<00:04:36.440> don't<00:04:36.590> know<00:04:36.680> the<00:04:36.800> drop

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
give a couple more I don't know the drop

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.320 
give a couple more I don't know the drop
rate<00:04:37.130> is<00:04:37.250> didn't<00:04:37.520> drop<00:04:37.640> at<00:04:37.790> that<00:04:37.880> time<00:04:38.060> I<00:04:38.240> think

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
rate is didn't drop at that time I think

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:39.940 
rate is didn't drop at that time I think
it's<00:04:38.720> a<00:04:38.810> bit<00:04:38.990> lower<00:04:39.170> than<00:04:39.380> the<00:04:39.440> maggots<00:04:39.830> are

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
it's a bit lower than the maggots are

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.920 
it's a bit lower than the maggots are
come<00:04:40.190> back<00:04:40.370> here<00:04:40.610> get<00:04:41.390> over<00:04:41.600> here

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
come back here get over here

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.600 
come back here get over here
you're<00:04:42.080> ruining<00:04:42.380> my<00:04:42.470> video<00:04:42.590> all<00:04:43.370> right<00:04:43.490> there

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
you're ruining my video all right there

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.090 
you're ruining my video all right there
we<00:04:43.700> go<00:04:44.080> okay<00:04:45.080> so<00:04:45.110> yeah<00:04:45.470> we've<00:04:45.650> got<00:04:45.800> ten

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
we go okay so yeah we've got ten

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.590 
we go okay so yeah we've got ten
exoskeleton<00:04:46.790> plates<00:04:47.000> so<00:04:47.150> they're<00:04:47.360> fairly

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
exoskeleton plates so they're fairly

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.470 
exoskeleton plates so they're fairly
easy<00:04:47.870> to<00:04:47.930> get<00:04:48.200> once<00:04:48.410> you<00:04:48.470> get<00:04:48.710> to<00:04:48.830> the<00:04:49.070> Erebus

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
easy to get once you get to the Erebus

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.190 
easy to get once you get to the Erebus
dimension<00:04:50.480> assuming<00:04:50.780> I<00:04:50.810> pronounced<00:04:51.080> that

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
dimension assuming I pronounced that

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.100 
dimension assuming I pronounced that
right<00:04:51.320> at<00:04:51.680> all<00:04:52.480> you<00:04:53.480> could<00:04:53.600> easily<00:04:53.750> get<00:04:53.990> the

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
right at all you could easily get the

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.600 
right at all you could easily get the
armor<00:04:54.380> well<00:04:54.650> I'm<00:04:54.830> not<00:04:55.010> sure<00:04:55.070> how<00:04:55.430> its

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
armor well I'm not sure how its

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.850 
armor well I'm not sure how its
durability<00:04:55.940> is<00:04:56.240> or<00:04:56.450> how<00:04:56.720> strong<00:04:57.170> it<00:04:57.350> is<00:04:57.410> that

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
durability is or how strong it is that

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.490 
durability is or how strong it is that
it's<00:04:58.070> not<00:04:58.280> been<00:04:58.550> um<00:04:58.960> not<00:04:59.960> been<00:05:00.110> mentioned<00:05:00.440> yet

mentioned it a lot that there's a lot of
stuff<00:05:08.750> in<00:05:08.840> the<00:05:08.930> plan<00:05:09.140> so<00:05:09.290> it's<00:05:09.470> all<00:05:09.560> like

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
stuff in the plan so it's all like

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
this is probably gonna be their first um

set of tools and armor is gonna be with
the<00:05:21.260> bone<00:05:21.440> or<00:05:21.650> you<00:05:21.860> can<00:05:22.250> only<00:05:22.370> imagine<00:05:22.640> it

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
the bone or you can only imagine it

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.060 
the bone or you can only imagine it
would<00:05:22.970> be<00:05:23.030> um<00:05:23.750> there<00:05:24.080> is<00:05:24.200> one<00:05:24.410> thing<00:05:24.650> I<00:05:24.800> thought

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
would be um there is one thing I thought

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.440 
would be um there is one thing I thought
I'd<00:05:25.220> throw<00:05:25.400> out<00:05:25.430> there<00:05:25.669> I<00:05:25.820> don't<00:05:26.120> know<00:05:26.300> if<00:05:26.360> this

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
I'd throw out there I don't know if this

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.120 
I'd throw out there I don't know if this
is<00:05:26.540> a<00:05:26.570> good<00:05:26.810> thing<00:05:26.840> or<00:05:27.260> a<00:05:27.320> bad<00:05:27.440> thing<00:05:27.680> but

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 
is a good thing or a bad thing but

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:29.710 
is a good thing or a bad thing but
you'll<00:05:28.580> notice<00:05:28.760> there's<00:05:28.940> or<00:05:29.120> all<00:05:29.390> over<00:05:29.630> the

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
you'll notice there's or all over the

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.820 
you'll notice there's or all over the
place<00:05:29.870> and<00:05:30.020> we're<00:05:30.110> actually<00:05:30.380> really<00:05:30.620> low<00:05:30.800> down

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
place and we're actually really low down

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.570 
place and we're actually really low down
right<00:05:31.760> now<00:05:31.880> we're<00:05:32.060> at<00:05:32.350> 32<00:05:33.350> pretty<00:05:33.860> low<00:05:34.010> but

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
right now we're at 32 pretty low but

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.280 
right now we're at 32 pretty low but
yeah<00:05:34.669> it's<00:05:34.820> extremely<00:05:35.419> easy<00:05:35.600> to<00:05:35.810> find<00:05:36.020> or

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.290 
yeah it's extremely easy to find or

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.290 
yeah it's extremely easy to find or
because<00:05:36.620> of<00:05:36.650> this<00:05:37.160> mod<00:05:37.400> then<00:05:37.760> that<00:05:38.120> could<00:05:38.240> be

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
because of this mod then that could be

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.490 
because of this mod then that could be
considered<00:05:38.630> a<00:05:38.780> good<00:05:38.900> thing<00:05:38.960> by<00:05:39.260> a<00:05:39.290> lot<00:05:39.470> of

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
in multiple different volumes into this

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.060 
in multiple different volumes into this
dimension<00:06:08.350> so<00:06:09.350> that<00:06:09.650> should<00:06:09.860> be<00:06:09.890> interesting

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070 
dimension so that should be interesting

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.730 
dimension so that should be interesting
right<00:06:10.850> now<00:06:11.030> it's<00:06:11.419> just<00:06:11.540> kind<00:06:11.660> of<00:06:11.900> like<00:06:11.960> a<00:06:12.440> mix

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.469 
put it all into like one dimension mix
it<00:06:22.160> all<00:06:22.220> together<00:06:22.340> like<00:06:22.970> this<00:06:23.120> is<00:06:23.180> the<00:06:23.240> coolest

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:23.479 
it all together like this is the coolest

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:24.940 
it all together like this is the coolest
stuff<00:06:23.690> is<00:06:23.840> like<00:06:23.960> a<00:06:23.990> junk<00:06:24.350> ball<00:06:24.530> the<00:06:24.650> mushroom

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:26.450 
biome they kind of mix it together and

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.480 
biome they kind of mix it together and
felt<00:06:27.110> like<00:06:27.200> fines<00:06:27.560> up<00:06:27.890> and<00:06:28.100> it<00:06:28.160> looks<00:06:28.310> really

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.820 
felt like fines up and it looks really
cool<00:06:28.760> I<00:06:28.820> really<00:06:29.390> loved<00:06:29.630> the<00:06:29.750> generation<00:06:30.320> the

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:30.830 
cool I really loved the generation the

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:31.990 
cool I really loved the generation the
generation<00:06:30.860> is<00:06:31.220> much<00:06:31.310> better<00:06:31.520> than<00:06:31.700> that<00:06:31.849> in

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 
generation is much better than that in

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.340 
generation is much better than that in
regular<00:06:32.210> minecraft<00:06:32.570> and

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:33.350 
regular minecraft and

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.500 
regular minecraft and
I<00:06:33.800> might<00:06:34.370> say<00:06:34.580> one<00:06:34.880> of<00:06:35.030> the<00:06:35.180> coolest

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:35.510 
I might say one of the coolest

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:38.440 
I might say one of the coolest
dimensions<00:06:35.930> I've<00:06:36.080> seen<00:06:36.350> in<00:06:36.590> in<00:06:37.340> most<00:06:38.240> of<00:06:38.360> the

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:38.450 
dimensions I've seen in in most of the

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.060 
dimensions I've seen in in most of the
dimension<00:06:38.840> mods<00:06:39.020> that<00:06:39.140> I've<00:06:39.320> looked<00:06:39.560> at<00:06:39.740> one

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:40.070 
dimension mods that I've looked at one

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.430 
dimension mods that I've looked at one
of<00:06:40.160> my<00:06:40.220> favorites<00:06:40.700> so<00:06:41.360> if<00:06:41.720> they<00:06:41.960> work<00:06:42.200> on<00:06:42.320> this

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.440 
of my favorites so if they work on this

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.780 
of my favorites so if they work on this
really<00:06:42.740> hard<00:06:42.920> this<00:06:43.070> could<00:06:43.340> end<00:06:43.520> up<00:06:43.610> being

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:43.790 
really hard this could end up being

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:45.040 
really hard this could end up being
something<00:06:43.880> really<00:06:44.330> great<00:06:44.510> that<00:06:44.690> is<00:06:44.840> my
