like<00:00:02.669> they<00:00:02.790> did<00:00:02.939> the<00:00:03.030> tide<00:00:03.240> last<00:00:03.480> game<00:00:03.720> so<00:00:04.020> yeah

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
like they did the tide last game so yeah

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.260 
like they did the tide last game so yeah
I<00:00:04.799> think<00:00:05.069> that<00:00:05.460> would<00:00:05.580> actually<00:00:05.850> be<00:00:06.000> the

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
I think that would actually be the

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.400 
I think that would actually be the
vantage<00:00:06.540> point<00:00:06.569> since<00:00:06.930> you<00:00:07.080> can<00:00:07.259> actually

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
vantage point since you can actually

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.509 
vantage point since you can actually
like<00:00:07.680> you<00:00:07.710> make<00:00:07.919> sure<00:00:08.040> to<00:00:08.099> put<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.340> razor

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
like you make sure to put the razor
