00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
but it's just not that easy to actually

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 
that's probably easier but it did take

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:04.240 
that's probably easier but it did take
me<00:02:03.080> a<00:02:03.110> couple<00:02:03.349> of<00:02:03.410> tries<00:02:03.590> before<00:02:04.039> I<00:02:04.069> was

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.559 
actually a buck dig in there and open it
however<00:02:06.619> this<00:02:06.830> is<00:02:06.979> really<00:02:07.280> a<00:02:07.310> small<00:02:07.640> thing<00:02:07.849> so

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
however this is really a small thing so
