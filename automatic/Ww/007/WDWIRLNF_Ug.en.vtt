00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:09.480
 Hello everyone, I decided to show how I am doing 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.500
 pegs from apple trees and 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.400
 such a classic player of course not 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.480
 metal 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.060
 and how would I understand that the metal in 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.019
 aesthetically beautiful there titanium 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.880
 and so on and here is the classic of apple trees 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.300
 and it sounds different completely to you 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:34.370
 in work it is difficult to dry it 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.020
 pretty not easy at first i will 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.899
 dry so that it does not crack well 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:45.450
 almost impossible i do like this 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.079
 Now I behold the natural curve of the AOC 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.879
 a cop 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:55.680
 the handle and the knife itself I will be right myself 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:57.600
 asks for coco here and such 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.780
 the way i dry dry only 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.780
 only in the apartment no longer had you there 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.020
 where the temperature is constant and 23 24 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.930
 degrees on another it is impossible to dry 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.450
 she starts to burst everywhere literally 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.610
 in three days 4 drying it bursts here 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.000
 make out impossible because here 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.960
 there is a core so there inside quite 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.350
 solid wood and it bursts i do 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:31.979
 in such a way that I grease first 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:38.009
 the ends of 22 days dries then I coat in 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:41.040
 great great great bind the whole thing copper 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:44.869
 wire force to the end 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:48.930
 did not sell and then wind up 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.700
 foil butt so that the boil starts to dry 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.380
 not from the ends 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:02:00.630
 and the middle is what it is like this 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:03.149
 heat goes and the end 100 dries the most 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.520
 last not burst dries everything 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:09.020
 this is a matter of about two and a half months 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.970
 because there is no other way to dry 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:17.370
 hard wood 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:20.700
 Hard here well, it turns out sonorous and 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.670
 good even by sound 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.670
 define a large or shallow dream will 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.650
 you can wet 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.230
 already separate conversation you can wrung out 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.769
 shore and long and catch from the beach to make sour 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.290
 it will still not only come from the boat 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:42.530
 here but here I showed how this whole thing 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.530
 dries like this now show 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:53.330
 here it all dries in such a pile 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.330
 like this 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:10.950
 like this it dries with their ends all 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:15.430
 it dries 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:18.400
 you captive month then I show next 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.880
 wood processing is not complex 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:25.740
 knife does not particularly do not chisel 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:30.940
 electro chisel is taken bad 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:34.990
 show here it turns out very good 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:38.560
 sonorous and all that catchy well 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:42.970
 the next video will show how it goes on 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:48.730
 process equipment here is purchased 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:51.250
 so good for handling something 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.820
 even came from America passed one and a half 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:58.750
 months for processing because firm 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:01.990
 wood sandpaper sanders 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:06.310
 you will take nothing but one word further 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:08.730
 I will show how I was doing next thanks for 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.730
 Attention
