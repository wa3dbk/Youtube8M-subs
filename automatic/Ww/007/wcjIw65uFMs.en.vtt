about one of the most important aspects

about one of the most important aspects
of<00:00:34.280> photography<00:00:34.570> namely<00:00:35.570> composition<00:00:36.140> if<00:00:37.040> you

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
of photography namely composition if you

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.619 
of photography namely composition if you
don't<00:00:37.309> think<00:00:37.520> about<00:00:37.610> the<00:00:37.760> composition<00:00:38.000> then

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
don't think about the composition then

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:40.049 
don't think about the composition then
you<00:00:38.719> will<00:00:38.840> never<00:00:38.930> get<00:00:39.200> any<00:00:39.350> interesting<00:00:39.800> shots

after<00:00:41.059> all<00:00:41.450> it's<00:00:41.809> not<00:00:41.899> the<00:00:42.050> camera<00:00:42.260> that<00:00:42.410> takes

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
after all it's not the camera that takes

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
it's the photographer well technically

it's the photographer well technically
you<00:00:46.940> get<00:00:47.089> the<00:00:47.210> point

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:48.880 
you get the point

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.640 
you get the point
getting<00:00:49.420> some<00:00:49.570> interesting<00:00:49.810> shots<00:00:50.230> isn't<00:00:50.560> all

getting some interesting shots isn't all
difficult<00:00:51.250> if<00:00:51.340> you<00:00:51.460> take<00:00:51.640> composition<00:00:52.120> into

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
difficult if you take composition into

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.720 
difficult if you take composition into
account<00:00:52.950> composition<00:00:53.950> is<00:00:54.040> essentially<00:00:54.550> about

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
account composition is essentially about

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.520 
account composition is essentially about
how<00:00:55.059> when<00:00:55.270> various<00:00:55.630> subjects<00:00:56.079> end<00:00:56.230> up<00:00:56.350> in<00:00:56.470> the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
how when various subjects end up in the

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.220 
how when various subjects end up in the
frame<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.910> good<00:00:58.090> thing<00:00:58.270> is<00:00:58.390> that<00:00:58.570> if<00:00:58.780> flour

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
frame the good thing is that if flour

composition is highly subjective
there<00:01:01.270> are<00:01:01.360> simple<00:01:01.570> tricks<00:01:01.840> that<00:01:01.989> you<00:01:02.079> could

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 
there are simple tricks that you could

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.900 
there are simple tricks that you could
use<00:01:02.379> for<00:01:02.680> composition<00:01:03.190> that<00:01:03.550> will<00:01:03.700> make<00:01:03.820> your

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
use for composition that will make your

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.570 
use for composition that will make your
images<00:01:04.239> stand<00:01:04.510> out<00:01:04.600> much<00:01:04.809> more<00:01:05.080> if<00:01:05.710> an<00:01:06.400> image

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
images stand out much more if an image

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.800 
images stand out much more if an image
doesn't<00:01:06.760> send<00:01:07.000> out<00:01:07.090> from<00:01:07.270> the<00:01:07.390> crowd

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
doesn't send out from the crowd

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.469 
doesn't send out from the crowd
and<00:01:08.320> how<00:01:08.440> could<00:01:08.590> anyone<00:01:08.770> find<00:01:09.009> it<00:01:09.160> interesting

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
and how could anyone find it interesting

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.850 
and how could anyone find it interesting
so<00:01:10.479> for<00:01:10.600> this<00:01:10.660> reason<00:01:10.869> I'll<00:01:11.350> teach<00:01:11.530> you<00:01:11.680> some

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
so for this reason I'll teach you some

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:21.270 
so for this reason I'll teach you some
of<00:01:11.890> my<00:01:12.040> simple<00:01:12.400> tricks<00:01:19.380> for<00:01:20.380> starters<00:01:20.710> don't

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
of my simple tricks for starters don't

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.950 
of my simple tricks for starters don't
always<00:01:21.580> put<00:01:21.759> your<00:01:21.850> subject<00:01:22.030> exactly<00:01:22.780> in<00:01:22.869> the

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
always put your subject exactly in the

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.710 
always put your subject exactly in the
middle<00:01:23.050> place<00:01:23.860> the<00:01:24.039> bit<00:01:24.160> off-center<00:01:24.630> do<00:01:25.630> you

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
middle place the bit off-center do you

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.900 
middle place the bit off-center do you
know<00:01:25.810> the<00:01:25.930> rule<00:01:26.080> of<00:01:26.200> thirds<00:01:26.550> mr.<00:01:27.550> rule<00:01:27.729> which

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:27.910 
know the rule of thirds mr. rule which

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.850 
know the rule of thirds mr. rule which
states<00:01:28.240> that<00:01:28.509> an<00:01:28.780> image<00:01:28.960> is<00:01:29.080> generally<00:01:29.710> more

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
states that an image is generally more

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.469 
states that an image is generally more
appealing<00:01:30.160> if<00:01:30.399> you<00:01:30.700> put<00:01:30.850> lines<00:01:31.030> of<00:01:31.210> the<00:01:31.300> image

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
appealing if you put lines of the image

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.010 
appealing if you put lines of the image
along<00:01:31.869> the<00:01:32.020> 3x3<00:01:32.350> grid<00:01:32.590> like<00:01:33.520> this<00:01:33.930> but<00:01:34.930> you

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
along the 3x3 grid like this but you

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.330 
along the 3x3 grid like this but you
have<00:01:35.140> to<00:01:35.259> keep<00:01:35.380> in<00:01:35.530> mind<00:01:35.560> that<00:01:35.860> this<00:01:36.130> rule<00:01:36.310> is

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
have to keep in mind that this rule is

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
have to keep in mind that this rule is
just<00:01:36.670> helpful<00:01:36.910> too

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
just helpful too

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.180 
just helpful too
it<00:01:37.960> really<00:01:38.170> doesn't<00:01:38.440> always<00:01:38.619> make<00:01:38.830> sure<00:01:38.890> image

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
it really doesn't always make sure image

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.810 
it really doesn't always make sure image
is<00:01:39.310> more<00:01:39.490> interesting<00:01:41.310> secondly<00:01:42.310> get<00:01:42.580> rid<00:01:42.789> of

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
is more interesting secondly get rid of

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.060 
is more interesting secondly get rid of
background<00:01:43.270> distractions<00:01:43.780> the<00:01:44.560> worst<00:01:44.740> images

background distractions the worst images

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.680

are<00:01:45.340> those<00:01:45.399> that<00:01:45.610> don't<00:01:45.970> show<00:01:46.149> one<00:01:46.450> clear

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
are those that don't show one clear

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
could be the subject unless this is

could be the subject unless this is
exactly<00:01:51.130> what<00:01:51.310> you<00:01:51.429> wanted<00:01:51.610> to<00:01:51.729> do<00:01:51.880> is<00:01:52.270> usually

exactly what you wanted to do is usually
a<00:01:52.810> good<00:01:52.990> idea<00:01:53.049> to<00:01:53.350> isolate<00:01:53.799> your<00:01:53.950> subject<00:01:53.979> on

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
a good idea to isolate your subject on

a good idea to isolate your subject on
idea<00:01:55.720> slide<00:01:55.960> you<00:01:56.080> can<00:01:56.200> easily<00:01:56.350> do<00:01:56.590> this<00:01:56.770> by

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
idea slide you can easily do this by

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.560 
idea slide you can easily do this by
creasing<00:01:57.460> the<00:01:57.490> aperture<00:01:57.909> so<00:01:58.270> that<00:01:58.420> your

three<00:02:10.299> rounds<00:02:10.660> then<00:02:10.959> you<00:02:11.049> will<00:02:11.170> get<00:02:11.290> very

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
three rounds then you will get very

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.590 
three rounds then you will get very
simplistic<00:02:11.890> looking<00:02:12.250> images<00:02:12.600> that's

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
simplistic looking images that's

simplistic looking images that's
definitely<00:02:14.140> interesting<00:02:15.930> finally<00:02:16.930> try

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
definitely interesting finally try

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.410 
definitely interesting finally try
different<00:02:17.590> angles<00:02:17.829> if<00:02:18.190> you've<00:02:19.030> never<00:02:19.209> thought

different angles if you've never thought
of<00:02:19.570> composition<00:02:20.110> then<00:02:20.440> you<00:02:20.530> probably<00:02:20.860> never

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
of composition then you probably never

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.440 
of composition then you probably never
thought<00:02:21.340> of<00:02:21.489> the<00:02:21.579> angle<00:02:21.850> of<00:02:21.910> your<00:02:21.940> camera<00:02:22.299> to

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
preferably straight on for example or

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.069 
preferably straight on for example or
top<00:02:27.340> down<00:02:27.549> this<00:02:28.450> will<00:02:28.630> make<00:02:28.750> your<00:02:28.870> image

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:29.079 
top down this will make your image

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
appear much calmer and another trick if

extremely close to the ground for an

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.930 
extremely close to the ground for an

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
interesting perspective

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.090 
interesting perspective
there<00:02:42.690> is<00:02:42.810> obviously<00:02:43.230> more<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.500> conversation

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
there is obviously more to conversation

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.070 
there is obviously more to conversation
than<00:02:44.220> just<00:02:44.460> this<00:02:44.700> this<00:02:45.390> is<00:02:45.480> a<00:02:45.540> good<00:02:45.690> first<00:02:45.930> step

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
than just this this is a good first step

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.470 
than just this this is a good first step

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
to get into photography these tricks can

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.520 
to get into photography these tricks can
be<00:02:48.570> applied<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:48.870> whatever<00:02:49.140> kind<00:02:49.440> of
