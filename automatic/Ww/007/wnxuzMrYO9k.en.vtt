00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.560
 Hello! I'm Dmitry Fresco! 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.240
 The old year is coming to an end, which I cannot say about my enthusiasm. 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.760
 I hope you are with me? 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.400
 There is not much time left until the New Year holidays, and you probably already chose a main course. 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.960
 And have you chosen dessert? 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.800
 On New Year's Eve, it's a pity to spend a lot of energy on culinary delights. 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.900
 But a good dessert for a feast is like a cherry on a cake! 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.840
 I offer you a very simple dessert, 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.980
 which is so good that it will not leave anyone indifferent. 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.260
 Moreover, it can be easily changed to your liking! 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.740
 Moreover, you can cook something in advance, even for the day! 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.840
 And just before serving, put everything in shape and brown in the oven. 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.240
 Meet Apple crumble! 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.919
 So I will need: 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.840
 Sweet and sour hard apples. Grade Grenni Smith is perfect. 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.500
 Sugar 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.040
 Butter 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.120
 Cinnamon 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.260
 Flour 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.340
 The nuts 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.180
 Lemon 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.000
 Vanilla 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.020
 I became the owner of this device - the pinnacle of engineering! 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.440
 And now cleaning apples has turned from a boring occupation into an exciting process. 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.840
 In just a week, I fed my family with a variety of apple dishes. 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.340
 Put a piece of butter in the pan and immediately send sugar there. 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.480
 While preparing caramel cut apples. 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.500
 Caramel is kept under control. 

00:01:47.556 --> 00:01:49.556
 We send apples to the pan. 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.340
 Add cinnamon. 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.060
 First, the apples will give the juice, I will evaporate it over high heat. 

00:01:57.455 --> 00:01:59.455
 Some lemon juice. 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.729
 Leave on a small fire. 

00:02:03.594 --> 00:02:05.594
 Now we will deal with the second component. 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.900
 Mix the nuts. 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:11.340
 Sugar. 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:13.720
 Flour. 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.300
 Soft butter. 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.840
 And add some vanilla. 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.394
 Zatiruha is ready. 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.080
 Apples too. 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.420
 Now you can put everything in the fridge until use. 

00:02:30.564 --> 00:02:32.564
 And this moment has already come to me. 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.540
 Therefore, laid out in tins. 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.480
 Or you can use one big form. 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.780
 Now everything is removed in the oven. 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.940
 10-15 minutes at 180 degrees and the dessert is ready. 

00:02:48.675 --> 00:02:50.675
 Crumble - in English means "to crumble." 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.460
 Actually crumble is a mixture of sugar flour and butter, which we grind. 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.934
 In Russian - zatiruha. 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.600
 For the filling, you can take any fruits and berries in various combinations. 

00:03:00.735 --> 00:03:02.735
 You can bathe them in caramel, you can not bathe. 

00:03:02.735 --> 00:03:04.735
 Solid worth holding it in a little longer. 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.220
 Soft plum, peach, nectarine just sprinkle with fine sugar. 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.080
 Dried fruits would be good to boil a little in a little water. 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.980
 In Zatiruhe third flour can be replaced with oatmeal flakes. 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.660
 Add lemon zest, orange or grated chocolate. 

00:03:17.954 --> 00:03:19.954
 And you can just crumble macaroons. 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.080
 Or dried white bread, mixed with butter and fine sugar. 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.960
 You can flavor both the filling, and tatiruhu, or all together. 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.960
 Use cardamom, cinnamon, vanilla, anise, you can add a small pinch of pepper. 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
 You can splash rum, brandy or liqueur. 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.280
 This is a classic homemade recipe. Fast and easy. 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.669
 Even preschoolers can handle it. 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.180
 Winter holidays - the best time for joint experiments in the kitchen, if you stick out at home! 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.800
 Invite your friends, hand in a mold and let everyone collect their own stuffing to taste. 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.380
 Or mix everything in one big shape and make more strong tea, 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.795
 so nothing sticks together! ;) 

00:03:53.795 --> 00:03:55.740
 Happy New Year and Merry Christmas!
