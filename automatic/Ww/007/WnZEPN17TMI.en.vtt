00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.290
 hello and welcome to this page is 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.049
 today I will introduce you to the 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.140
 recipe for the puff pastry so for 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:23.160
 this will need a pan of a 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.670
 bowl of a measuring cup of a plate which 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.500
 go to the oven with parchment paper 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.240
 of a wooden spoon from a pocket to 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.230
 socket if you signed a bag to 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.420
 freezing with a pair of scissors 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.500
 for the ingredients we will need to 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.630
 two means 50 milliliters of water 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.800
 fifty thousand liters of milk or background 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:48.420
 of flour and 50 g of butter 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.840
 let's move on to the realization of 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:59.670
 the recipe so first of all we're going 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:03.539
 pour the milk the water and we will put 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.180
 our butter in the pan and we 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.000
 let's melt it all up by doing 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.850
 melt the butter with the water and the milk 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.920
 longer wait for the preparation to 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.920
 tines of boiling to put the woman 

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:23.630
 meanwhile we can put already 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.630
 our turn to preheat to 180 degrees 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.550
 so once all the butter is 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.280
 melted we'll wait until the mixture is 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.700
 boil and add the flour to a 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.700
 one shot 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:51.640
 here is our mixture is boiling 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:54.700
 so we add the flour at once and we 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:58.560
 gets a nice ball of dough that 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.560
 stick to the pan 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:19.680
 and we will transfer this ball of dough 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:22.130
 in our flight here now we 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.570
 let's add our eyes one by one 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:52.560
 so we add know the a German and 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:54.720
 we mix quickly we have to 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:01.950
 get a dough with a dye of 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:02.370
 cohmad once our paw is 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.660
 ready 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.660
 we will put in the piping bag 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:17.880
 in order to be simpler than one can 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:21.890
 use a measuring cup that it avoids 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.890
 to be obliged to hold the bag 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.900
 so for our dish we'll be gone 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.980
 our little puffs well spaced because 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.980
 that they go against cooking 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.970
 so using the pair of scissors 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.080
 will break our socket pocket so at 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.950
 using our piping bag 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:01.790
 we will make small piles of dough on 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.790
 other oven plate 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.269
 we can eventually make little ones 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.950
 sticks in order to make lightning at 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.950
 chocolate or coffee lightning 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.670
 once we have spread all our dough 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.160
 on the baking sheet 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:27.930
 it only remains to bake them 20 to 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:29.790
 25 minutes at 180 Â° so that's after 25 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.820
 minutes passed in the oven our cabbages are 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.770
